    "body": "Michael Burry attends the New York premiere of \"The Big Short\" at the Ziegfeld Theater in New York City on Nov. 23, 2015.Jim Spellman | WireImage | Getty ImagesMichael Burry, the investor who shot to fame for calling the housing crash before 2008, has launched a Substack newsletter after deregistering his hedge fund, aiming to lay out in detail his increasingly bearish thesis on artificial intelligence.\"The Big Short\" investor is capitalizing on the massive audience he's built on X, where 1.6 million followers have long parsed his cryptic posts. His new publication, titled \"Cassandra Unchained\" with a $379 annual subscription fee, arrives with a familiar warning: He believes markets are once again deep in bubble territory.In announcing the launch, Burry referenced the parallels between the late 1990s tech mania and today's rush into AI and how the bubbles have been ignored by policymakers, in his view.\"Feb 21, 2000: SF Chronicle says I'm short Amazon. Greenspan 2005: 'bubble in home prices … does not appear likely.' [Fed Chair Jerome] Powell '25: 'AI companies actually… are profitable… it's a different thing. 'I doubted if I ever should come back. I'm back. Please join me,\" Burry wrote in a post Sunday night on X.He highlighted then-Fed Chair Alan Greenspan's 2005 insistence that U.S. housing prices showed no signs of a bubble, just two years before the subprime implosion validated Burry's famous \"Big Short.\" And now he contends history is rhyming again.Like the dot-com era, investors are extrapolating exponential growth, dismissing profitability concerns and funding massive capital expenditures on the assumption that the technology will rewrite the economy, he believes.The investor noted Powell has waved off bubble fears, saying AI companies are \"actually profitable\" and \"a different thing\" from past booms.\"This is different in the sense that these companies, the companies that are so highly valued, actually have earnings and stuff like that,\" Powell said during a news conference in October.Burry took it as an eerie echo of the assurances offered by Greenspan two decades ago. At the height of the dot-com boom, Burry was publicly short Amazon. Today, he has been openly bearish on the poster children of the AI boom, Nvidia and Palantir.",

    "body": "Dado Ruvic | ReutersOpenAI will not be allowed use the word \"cameo\" to name any products or features in its Sora app for a month after a federal judge placed a temporary restraining order for the term on the AI startup.U.S. District Judge Eumi K. Lee granted a temporary restraining order on Monday, blocking OpenAI from using the \"cameo\" mark or similar words like \"Kameo\" or \"CameoVideo\" for any function related to Sora, the company's AI-generated video app.\"We disagree with the complaint's assertion that anyone can claim exclusive ownership over the word 'cameo', and we look forward to continuing to make our case to the court,\" an OpenAI spokesperson told CNBC. Lee granted the order after OpenAI was sued in October by Cameo, a platform that allows users to purchase personalized videos from celebrities. Cameo filed a trademark lawsuit against the artificial intelligence company following the launch of Sora's \"Cameo\" feature, which allowed users to generate characters of themselves or others and insert them into videos.\"We are gratified by the court's decision, which recognizes the need to protect consumers from the confusion that OpenAI has created by using the Cameo trademark,\" Cameo CEO Steven Galanis said in a statement. \"While the court's order is temporary, we hope that OpenAI will agree to stop using our mark permanently to avoid any further harm to the public or Cameo.\"The order is set to expire on Dec. 22, and a hearing for whether the halt should be made permanent is scheduled for Dec. 19. watch now",

The guides include top products, key differences between the products and the latest information from retailers, according to a blog. Users will be able to tailor their guides based on their budget, what features they care about and who they are shopping for. OpenAI said it will take a couple of minutes to generate answers with shopping research, so users who are looking for simple answers like a price check can still rely on a regular ChatGPT response.When users submit prompts to ChatGPT that say things like, \"Find the quietest cordless stick vacuum for a small apartment,\" or \"I need a gift for my four year old niece who loves art,\" they will see the shopping research tool pop up automatically, OpenAI said. The tool can also be accessed from the menu. OpenAI has been pushing deeper into e-commerce in recent months. The company introduced a feature called Instant Checkout in September that allows users to make purchases directly from eligible merchants through ChatGPT. Shopping research users will be able to make purchases with Instant Checkout in the future, OpenAI said on Monday. OpenAI said its shopping research results are organic and based on publicly available retail websites, and that it will not share users' chats with retailers. It's possible that shopping research will make mistakes around product availability and pricing, the company said.Shopping research is rolling out to OpenAI's Free, Go, Plus and Pro users who are logged in to ChatGPT.WATCH: OpenAI taps Foxconn to build AI hardware in the U.S.watch now",

    "body": "Sen. Mark Kelly, D-Ariz., talks with reporters in Dirksen building on Tuesday, October 28, 2025. Tom Williams | Cq-roll Call, Inc. | Getty ImagesThe Pentagon on Monday said that it was reviewing what it called \"serious allegations of misconduct\" against Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona for making a video with five other Democratic lawmakers that urged members of the military to refuse to follow illegal orders.The Pentagon said Kelly, who is a retired U.S. Navy captain, might be recalled to active military duty and face a possible court-martial on the allegations.President Donald Trump last week called Kelly and the other Democrats \"traitors,\" and said their statements on the video were \"seditious behavior at the highest level.\"Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, in a statement on X on Monday, said, \"The video made by the 'Seditious Six' was despicable, reckless, and false.\"\"Encouraging our warriors to ignore the orders of their Commanders undermines every aspect of 'good order and discipline,'\" said Hegseth.\"Five of the six individuals in that video do not fall under @DeptofWar jurisdiction,\" Hegseth wrote. \"However, Mark Kelly (retired Navy Commander) is still subject to UCMJ — and he knows that.\" UCMJ is the Uniform Code of Military Justice.The Pentagon, in its own social media statement, said that a \"thorough review of these allegations has been initiated to determine further actions, which may include recall to active duty for court-martial proceedings or administrative measures.\"\"This matter will be handled in compliance with military law, ensuring due process and impartiality,\" the Pentagon said.Kelly, in a response on X, said, \"Secretary Hegseth's tweet is the first I heard of this. I also saw the President's posts saying I should be arrested, hanged, and put to death.\"\"If this is meant to intimidate me and other members of Congress from doing our jobs and holding this administration accountable, it won't work,\" Kelly wrote.\"I've given too much to this country to be silenced by bullies who care more about their own power than protecting the Constitution.\"Read more CNBC politics coverageJudge dismisses James Comey and Letitia James cases over 'unlawful' prosecutor appointmentSen.

Elissa Slotkin, as well as House Reps. Jason Crow of Colorado, Maggie Goodlander of New Hampshire, and Chris Deluzio and Chrissy Houlahan, both of Pennsylvania.Slotkin is a former CIA analyst. Dekluzio and Goodlander are former Navy officers, and Houlahan is a former Air Force officer, but all three of them separated from those service branches rather than retired from them. Because they did not retire from those branches, they are not subject to the UCMJ, as Kelly is.Trump, in a Truth Social post on Thursday, said, \"Each one of these traitors to our Country should be ARRESTED AND PUT ON TRIAL.\"\"Their words cannot be allowed to stand — We won't have a Country  anymore!!! An example MUST BE SET.\"The Pentagon, in its statement Monday, said, \"The Department of War reminds all individuals that military retirees remain subject to the UCMJ for applicable offenses, and federal laws such as 18 U.S.C. § 2387 prohibit actions intended to interfere with the loyalty, morale, or good order and discipline of the armed forces.\"\"All servicemembers are reminded that they have a legal obligation under the UCMJ to obey lawful orders and that orders are presumed to be lawful,\" the statement said.\"A servicemember's personal philosophy does not justify or excuse the disobedience of an otherwise lawful order.\"Greg Lukianoff, CEO of the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, an advocacy group, in a statement said, \"The Pentagon's actions are clear retaliation for something Sen. Kelly is entirely within his rights to say.\"\"America's servicemembers already take an oath to uphold the Constitution, which includes not following illegal orders,\" Lukianoff said. \"The argument that the video's message is sedition, or otherwise unprotected by the First Amendment, is flatly wrong.\"",

    "body": "NY Attorney General Letitia and Former FBI Director James Comey.Michael M. Santiago | Cheriss May | Nurphoto | Getty ImagesA federal judge on Monday dismissed criminal cases against former FBI Director James Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James, ruling that Lindsey Halligan, the interim U.S. attorney who brought both indictments, was invalidly appointed.Halligan, President Donald Trump's former personal lawyer, had been installed as prosecutor in violation of the Appointments Clause of the Constitution, senior U.S. District Judge Cameron Currie ruled in both cases in U.S. District Court in Alexandria, Virginia.\"I conclude that all actions flowing from Ms. Halligan's defective appointment, including securing and signing Ms. James's indictment, constitute unlawful exercises of executive power and must be set aside,\" Currie ruled. An identical line appears in a separate order scrapping Comey's case. The cases were both dismissed \"without prejudice,\" potentially allowing charges to be filed again at a later date.The rulings are a major blow to Trump, who had openly pushed Attorney General Pam Bondi to take legal action against Comey, James and other perceived political foes.\"The facts of the indictments against Comey and James have not changed and this will not be the final word on this matter,\" White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson told CNBC in a statement.Bondi said later, \"We'll be taking all available legal action, including an immediate appeal to hold Letitia James and James Comey accountable for their unlawful conduct.\"Halligan is the fourth U.S. attorney of the second Trump administration to have been deemed wrongfully appointed by a judge.Comey, in an Instagram post celebrating the dismissal, said his prosecution was \"based on malevolence and incompetence, and a reflection of what the Department of Justice has become under Donald Trump, which is heartbreaking.\"\"I know that Donald Trump will probably come after me again,\" Comey said, \"and my attitude is going to be the same: I'm innocent, I am not afraid, and I believe in an independent federal judiciary, the gift from our founders that protects us from a would-be tyrant.\"Halligan's office declined to comment on Currie's rulings. The Department of Justice did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment.\"I am heartened by today's victory and grateful for the prayers and support I have received from around the country,\" James said in a statement following the dismissal. \"I remain fearless in the face of these baseless charges as I continue fighting for New Yorkers every single day.\"Comey was charged in late September on counts of making a false statement and obstruction stemming from his testimony to Congress years earlier.James was charged in mid-October with bank fraud and making false statements to a financial institution in connection with a mortgage she obtained to buy a home in 2020.Both had asked the judges in their respective cases to throw out the charges on the grounds that they were being vindictively prosecuted.   The indictment against Comey, a longtime target of Trump's ire, came days before a five-year statute of limitations was set to expire on Sept. 30.Currie's ruling suggested that Comey's statute of limitations remained in effect. In a footnote, the judge quoted a ruling from a separate case, which held, \"An invalid indictment ... cannot serve to block the door of limitations as it swings closed.\"The charges against Comey also came less than a week after Bondi, at Trump's behest, had appointed Halligan as interim U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia.The prior U.S. attorney for the district, Erik Siebert, had resigned after reportedly expressing concern about pursuing charges against Comey — and after Trump said publicly that he wanted Siebert out.In addition to the constitutional violation, Currie determined that Halligan's installation ran afoul of a statutory mechanism for appointing interim U.S. attorneys. The law, which gives the attorney general 120 days to make interim appointments, had been triggered by the appointment of Siebert on Jan. 21, the judge wrote.When that clock ran out on May 21, \"so too did the Attorney General's appointment authority,\" Currie ruled.Halligan has therefore \"been unlawfully serving in that role\" since her appointment on Sept. 22, Currie wrote.The judge noted that in both cases, Halligan was the only prosecutor who presented information to the grand juries that ultimately returned the indictments.James' attorney, Abbe Lowell, said he would challenge \"any further politically motivated charges\" from the Trump administration.\"The President went to extreme measures to substitute one of his allies to bring these baseless charges after career prosecutors refused,\" Lowell said in a statement. \"This case was not about justice or the law; it was about targeting Attorney General James for what she stood for and who she challenged.\"",

    "body": "A Broadcom circuit board for chip testing is pictured during a lab tour as Broadcom prepares to launch new optical chip tech to fend off Nvidia in San Jose, California, U.S., September 5, 2025.  Brittany Hosea-small | ReutersBroadcom shares rallied 11.1% on Monday, making it the S&P 500's top performer of the day, as investors poured back into several high-flying tech companies tied to the artificial intelligence trade. Wall Street is also taking notice of the chipmaker as a derivate play of Alphabet's growing AI dominance. Broadcom — one of the biggest suppliers of high-performance, application-specific chips, or ASICs, for hyperscalers — has been on a tear this year, rallying 60% year to date. Monday's rally saw Broadcom notch its best day since April 9. The stock was also the best performer in the Technology Select Sector SPDR fund (XLK), which tracks the S&P 500 tech sector. The move in Broadcom comes as investors continue to push shares of Google-parent Alphabet higher. The stock rose more than 5% as the artificial intelligence trade regained some of the recently lost ground. The two are related through ASICs: Google is a major customer of Broadcom's ASIC business, as Broadcom helps design and manufacture Google's tensor processing units (TPUs). These are Google's in-house specialized AI chips, used for the company's internal AI infrastructure. Google TPUs are considered a competitor to Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) for AI workloads. Analysts have recently lifted their outlooks on Broadcom on enthusiasm about its relationship with Alphabet. Melius Research's Ben Reitzes last month reiterated his buy rating on Broadcom and lifted his price target on the stock by $60 to $475, which suggests 39.6% potential upside from Friday's close.\"Google and its partner, Broadcom, have been at it together with this custom ASIC since 2016, now in its 7th generation. Outside of the Nvidia GPU for AI workloads, the TPU is the most proven ASIC out there — and now it has the most tangible momentum. The decision to develop this product early is now starting to inflect to the upside — delivering for both Broadcom's AI revenues and Google Cloud (GCP) growth,\" Reitzes wrote in an Oct. 27 note to clients.\"While good for Alphabet, it may turn out to be even better for Broadcom, who could have huge upside to its AI revenues with Alphabet and a host of other partners who want a piece of this design expertise,\" he continued, adding that the \"TPU is rapidly becoming a larger part of Alphabet's growth strategy.\"Stock Chart IconStock chart iconBroadcom stock performance over the past year.Jefferies analyst Blayne Curtis, who has the highest price target among analysts on Broadcom, per LSEG, named the stock a top pick earlier this month and said that ASICs are hitting an \"inflection point\" as Google's need for custom chips continues to grow.\"Google has long been the main ASIC customer for AVGO but those volumes should become much more meaningful in C26/27,\" Curtis wrote in a Nov. 3 note. \"Google continues to see the amount of tokens they process per month rise and announced 1,300T in October up from 480T in April 2025. This should grow even more as compute is needed for multimodal models.\"Curtis has a buy rating on shares and lifted his price target by $65 to $480. That implies the stock could jump another 41%.Dan Ives, Wedbush Securities global head of technology research, told CNBC he is very bullish on Broadcom and Alphabet. Ives owns both stocks in the Dan IVES Wedbush AI Revolution ETF (IVES).\"Broadcom and Alphabet are the new AI plays the market is rediscovering the massive market for ASIC chips with Google leading the charge,\" he said. \"This could be the most proven ASIC chip in the market and the AI Revolution is still early days ... it's been a historic quick turnaround to the very bullish Street sentiment today.Alphabet shares are up 21% over the past month, outperforming its \"Magnificent Seven\" peers and propelling the broader market higher in recent trading sessions. Investors have reacted positively to Google's latest AI model Gemini 3, its upcoming seventh-generation TPU called \"Ironwood,\" its advancements in AI image generation with Nano Banana Pro and its new agent platform called \"Google Antigravity.\"  ",

    "body": "watch nowA super PAC backed by the artificial intelligence industry on Monday launched a $10 million campaign to push Congress to craft a national AI policy that will override a patchwork of state laws, the group told CNBC.The campaign from \"Leading the Future,\" which launched over the summer with more than $100 million in initial funding, signals how the booming industry plans to leverage its wealth and power in next year's midterm elections.\"There is broad public demand for congressional action and a uniform national approach to AI,\" said Nathan Leamer, executive director of \"Build American AI,\" the PAC's advocacy arm. \"We are excited to have created this platform for Americans excited about the future of AI, to engage their members of Congress and make a difference.\"The campaign will run TV, digital and social media ads, plus organize 10,000 calls to lawmakers' offices this week alone, according to a memo about the campaign shared with CNBC.President Donald Trump appears to be convinced already: He wrote on Truth Social last Tuesday that the U.S. \"MUST have one Federal Standard instead of a patchwork of 50 State Regulatory Regimes.\"The same day, Leamer posted a picture of himself at the White House, saying he was there to discuss \"the need for a national AI framework.\"The PAC's mobilization comes as the White House and congressional Republicans are working to suppress states' ability to implement their AI laws.Several sources familiar with those ongoing discussions told CNBC that the plan is to insert language into one of the must-pass spending bills that Congress is expected to vote on in the next few months.Meanwhile, a draft executive order that surfaced last week aims to preempt state AI laws by creating a new \"AI Litigation Task Force\" and threatening to withhold federal funding.Trump, whose AI-friendly administration has sought to encourage the industry by lowering regulatory barriers, is expected to sign an executive order related to AI later Monday, a senior official told a White House pool reporter.It is not clear whether that order is the same as, or similar to, the draft order circulating at the White House. The White House did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for clarification. Trump is scheduled to sign an executive order in the Oval Office at 4 p.m. ET.Leading the Future is backed by numerous AI industry leaders, including venture capital giant Andreessen Horowitz, Palantir co-founder Joe Lonsdale, AI search-engine company Perplexity and SV Angel founder Ron Conway.The PAC recently announced its first target of the 2026 midterms: New York Assemblymember Alex Bores, who is running in the crowded Democratic primary for the Manhattan seat held by retiring Rep. Jerry Nadler.Bores co-sponsored the RAISE Act, which codifies safety protocols for the largest AI companies. The bill has passed the state legislature but has not yet been signed by Gov. Kathy Hochul, a Democrat.\"We should eventually have a federal AI standard. I strongly agree with that,\" Bores said Monday morning on CNBC's \"Squawk Box.\"\"But what is being debated right now is, should we stop the states from making any progress before the feds have solved the problem, or should we actually work together to have the federal government solve the problem?\" Bores said.",

    "body": "Your Hometown Deli in Paulsboro, N.J.Google EarthThat's one big deli bill to skip out of paying.A federal judge is hotter than a newly brewed pot of coffee over the failure of Peter Coker Sr. and his son, Peter Coker Jr., to pay millions of dollars in restitution for their leading roles in the notorious $100 million New Jersey deli stock fraud.The Coker convicts owe a total of $5.56 million to victims of their scam, which involved illegally inflating the stock prices of two publicly traded companies to make them attractive candidates for mergers.The scheme led to one of the companies, then-known as Hometown International, having a market capitalization of more than $100 million despite owning only one small, money-losing delicatessen in the hardscrabble south Jersey town of Paulsboro. Shares of the other company, then known as E-Waste, were worth even more on paper at one point despite owning no appreciable assets. Judge Christine O'Hearn, in a scathing order about the Cokers on Monday, said, \"It appears ... that, despite having substantial liquid assets at the time the sentence was imposed, neither Defendant has complied with the restitution deadlines set by the Court.\"\"It appears to the Court that Defendants have purposefully failed to make payment, perhaps in an effort to avoid doing so and/or dissipating or transferring assets,\" O'Hearn wrote in U.S. District Court in New Jersey.Peter Coker Sr. and his wife Susan Coker at U.S. District Court in Newark, New Jersey, March 15, 2023.Dan Mangan | CNBCPeter Coker Sr., who lives in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, owed his first installment of $2.5 million in restitution within 30 days of Aug. 11, according to an order by O'Hearn in August. Coker Jr., a businessman who previously lived in Hong Kong, owed his first installment of $1.5 million within 30 days of the same date.The Cokers and a third defendant who pleaded guilty in the case, James Patten, are jointly liable for the $5.56 million in total restitution. Patten has yet to be sentenced; because of that, he is not currently required to start paying restitution.Retail investors are owed $178,849 in total restitution. And investment arms of Duke and Vanderbilt universities are owed $3.1 million and $2.3 million, respectively, in restitution.In her Monday order, O'Hearn demanded answers from prosecutors and the Cokers' lawyers within two weeks on questions related to the failure to pay restitution so far.The judge told them \"to take all necessary steps forthwith to secure payment of the restitution amounts previously ordered.\"One potential hurdle to getting money from Peter Coker Jr. is the fact that the 57-year-old is no longer in prison — or even the United States. Coker Jr. renounced his U.S. citizenship years ago.On Oct. 16, a day after his release from prison, he we was deported to the Caribbean nation of St. Kitts and Nevis, where he has citizenship, according to a letter to O'Hearn from his lawyer.Peter Coker Jr., left, is issued search warrants from police at his villa on the southern resort island of Phuket, Thailand, Jan. 11, 2023.Crime Suppression Division, Royal Thai Police | APHis father, Peter Coker Sr., 83, is slated to be released on Dec. 8 from a residential reentry facility in North Carolina maintained by the U.S. Bureau of Prisons, having been released from a prison in Butner, North Carolina, on Tuesday.Coker Sr.'s lawyer, Zach Intrater, in a letter last week to O'Hearn, disputed the idea that he owed any payments toward restitution while he was still locked up in prison.Intrater, who did not respond to a request for comment from CNBC, in that letter said that \"Mr. Coker, Sr., is not looking to avoid his responsibilities under the amended judgment,\" and that he \"will begin making the required payments toward restitution.\"Read more CNBC politics coverageJudge dismisses James Comey and Letitia James cases over 'unlawful' prosecutor appointmentSen.

Indeed, there had been prior discussions and proposals by counsel as to an immediate up front payment, albeit in a much lesser amount with later installments thereafter, which the Court declined to adopt.\"Both Cokers pleaded guilty before O'Hearn last December to securities fraud and conspiracy to commit securities fraud. In May, O'Hearn sentenced the elder Coker to six months in jail, and Coker Jr. to 40 months in prison. The younger Coker was released last month because he received credit for the more than two years he spent locked up in a New Jersey jail before his sentencing.John Azzarello, a lawyer for Coker Jr., in a letter to the judge on Thursday, said his representation of Coker Jr. ended with his sentencing, that he has no contact with the fraudster since his sentencing, and \"we do not know Mr. Coker Jr.'s current whereabouts.\"\"Mr. Coker Jr. also has an outstanding invoice for legal services rendered which remains unpaid to date,\" Azzarello wrote. Azzarello did not respond to requests for comment.CNBC has also requested comment from the U.S. Attorney's Office for New Jersey, which prosecuted the Cokers and Patten.",

Joe Skipper | ReutersAmazon said Monday it will begin allowing businesses to test its recently rebranded internet-from-space service that seeks to compete with SpaceX's Starlink.Select businesses will be able to test Amazon Leo production hardware and software as part of an \"enterprise preview\" of the service \"ahead of a wider rollout,\" the company said in a blog post. The test program will allow Amazon to collect feedback and \"tailor solutions for specific industries\" ahead of a broader launch, the company said. Earlier this month, Amazon renamed its satellite internet offering from Project Kuiper to Amazon Leo and rolled out a new website to market the service. The name is a nod to low Earth orbit, a region of space that's within 1,200 miles of Earth's surface and where Amazon's satellite constellation will be concentrated. Six years ago, Amazon unveiled its plans to build a constellation of 3,236 low Earth satellites, designed to provide high-speed, low-latency internet to consumers, corporations and governments, offering connections through square-shaped terminals. The company has sent up more than 150 satellites since April through a series of rocket launches handled by partners, such as United Launch Alliance and Elon Musk's SpaceX. It's aiming to compete with Starlink, owned by SpaceX, which currently dominates the market and has nearly 9,000 satellites in orbit.Amazon has inked deals with JetBlue, L3Harris and Australia's NBN internet network, among others. Amazon said it's shipping units of its \"Pro\" terminals, as well as its \"Ultra\" antennas, to members of its enterprise preview program. The company on Monday showed off the final production design of its Ultra model, which will offer download speeds of up to 1 gigabit per second and upload speeds up to 400 megabits per second powered by an in-house custom silicon chip, \"making it the fastest commercial phased array antenna in production.\"Amazon said it expects to expand the program to more customers as it adds coverage and capacity to the Leo network.  The company has yet to disclose pricing and availability for consumers.

Grogan | CNBCOpenAI CEO Sam Altman said on Friday that the artificial intelligence startup has finally finished its first prototypes for hardware devices.\"Finally, we have the first prototypes,\" Altman said in a video posted Monday by Emerson Collective, which invests in entrepreneurs. \"I can't believe how jaw dropping good the work is and how exciting it is.\"Altman was speaking in an on-stage discussion with former Apple design chief Jony Ive and Laurene Powell Jobs, wife of the late Apple co-founder and CEO Steve Jobs and president and founder of Emerson Collective. In May, OpenAI acquired Ive's startup, called io, for $6.4 billion in equity and announced that it would make new AI devices. Ive took on design responsibilities on the hardware project. Since then, OpenAI and io have been relatively quiet about the project. Ive said he expects to reveal the device in two years or less. He said that much of the development process for new hardware is unpredictable.\"Especially in large companies that value predictability, leaders get really uncomfortable with ambiguity,\" Ive said. Altman declined to answer a question about what exactly OpenAI is building, but said the company is targeting a calmer \"vibe\" with its hardware versus smartphones, which he compared to walking through Times Square.\"You can then go for a vibe that is not like walking through Times Square and getting bumped into and having all this stuff compete for your attention,\" Altman said. \"But, like, sitting in the most beautiful cabin by a lake and in the mountains and sort of just enjoying the peace and calm.\"He said a smart AI device will be able to do things for the user over long periods of time, filter things out and understand when something is important enough to notify the user. Altman added that the device will be able to \"know everything you've ever thought about, read, said.\"OpenAI's hardware plans are being closely watched by rivals and potential customers alike. Companies including Amazon, Google, and Meta have released AI-oriented devices like smart glasses and speakers, but none has been a big enough hit to reshape the hardware industry. Startups are also experimenting with new device sizes like pendants and ideas like giving AI bots a personality. A major device launch from OpenAI, which has the most used chatbot with ChatGPT, could break the stalemate, and a successful product could eventually threaten Apple. The iPhone maker has yet to release an AI specific design, and the company has run into issues with rolling out improvements to Siri, its long-standing AI voice assistant. In March, Apple announced that it was delaying Siri improvements to 2026. Last week, OpenAI said it entered into an agreement with Foxconn, which manufactures many consumer electronics, including for Apple. However, the OpenAI deal with Foxconn is focused on building AI infrastructure, and the companies didn't mention device manufacturing.

    "body": "A view shows a Novo Nordisk sign outside its office in Bagsvaerd, on the outskirts of Copenhagen, Denmark, on July 14, 2025.Tom Little | ReutersShares of Novo Nordisk on Monday fell to a four-year low after the Danish pharmaceutical company said a highly anticipated trial for Alzheimer's disease failed to meet its main goal.The trial tested whether semaglutide — the active ingredient in Novo's blockbuster diabetes and weight loss drugs Ozempic and Wegovy — helped slow progression for Alzheimer's disease. While treatment with semaglutide resulted in improvement of Alzheimer's disease-related biomarkers in two separate trials, this did not translate into a delay of disease progression, Novo said in a statement Monday. The goal had been to slow patients' cognitive decline by at least 20%.Novo stock was down 10% to 274 Danish kroner ($42.33) in afternoon trade, its lowest level since mid-2021. The shares later regained some ground to preliminarily close the session 5.8% lower.Analysts had prior to the results called the trial a long shot, whereas Novo itself had referred to it as a \"lottery ticket.\"\"Based on the significant unmet need in Alzheimer's disease as well as a number of indicative data points, we felt we had a responsibility to explore semaglutide's potential, despite a low likelihood of success,\" said Novo's chief scientific officer, Martin Holst Lange.A long shotThe trial results are a setback for Novo investors that had hoped that it might reignite the company's battered share price. Even before the Monday readout, Novo stock had halved year to date amid a series of guidance cuts and heighted competition, especially in the key U.S. market. \"While hopes were not high for a positive readout, potential success had perhaps kept some in the name, with this result removing a near-term upside scenario,\" wrote Jefferies analysts on Monday.Alzheimer's disease, the most common form of dementia, is notoriously difficult to treat. It is also expected to affect an increasing proportion of people worldwide as populations grow older. Read moreCurrent treatments such as Eli Lilly's Kisunla and Biogen/Eisai's Leqembi have been shown to slow down the progression of the disease by up to a third, but come with the risk of severe side effects. Shares of Eli Lilly traded nearly 0.8% higher Monday at the closing bell in London, while Biogen stock rose 2.6%.Novo's decision to test Rybelsus, an oral form of semaglutide, had been largely based on real-world evidence suggesting a correlation between Alzheimer's and taking semaglutide.The drug works in a similar way to Lilly's rival medicines Mounjaro and Zepbound by mimicking the gut hormone GLP-1 that naturally occurs in the body, to regulate blood sugar levels and enhance feelings of fullness. It's not yet clear how GLP-1s might benefit Alzheimer's patients, but the theory is that it targets the neuroinflammation thought to impact them.Top-line results will be presented at the Clinical Trials on Alzheimer's Disease conference on Dec. 3, with full results at the 2026 Alzheimer's and Parkinson's Diseases Conference in March, Novo said.A competitive marketWhile shares of Novo Nordisk have plunged over the past 18 months, rival Eli Lilly only last week became the first pharmaceutical company with a market capitalization of $1 trillion.Even as Ozempic hit the market four years before Mounjaro, Novo's head start hasn't prevented Lilly from quickly grabbing a bigger market share in the U.S. This year, Novo has cut its guidance several times, blaming so-called compounders which sell copycat versions of semaglutide for a cheaper price. watch nowNovo recently replaced its chairman and half its board members over a disagreement between the former board and Novo's controlling shareholder, the Novo Nordisk Foundation, about the scope and pace of change needed. It came just months after former CEO Lars Fruergaard Jørgensen was booted after an eight-year reign due to the stock decline.The former board was \"too slow in recognizing the significance of the market changes in the United States,\" new Chair Lars Rebien Sørensen said at the time.New CEO Mike Doustdar, who previously headed Novo's ex-U.S. operations, quickly set out to refocus the company's commercial priorities to its core obesity and diabetes businesses and to cut more than 10% of its global workforce.

    "body": "Dario Amodei, co-founder and CEO of artificial intelligence startup Anthropic.Chesnot | Getty ImagesAnthropic on Monday announced Claude Opus 4.5, its latest artificial intelligence model that the startup says excels at coding, using computers and assisting users with complex enterprise tasks. Claude Opus 4.5 marks Anthropic's third major model launch in two months, and it serves as the latest example of the nonstop pace of development within the AI industry. The startup unveiled its Claude Sonnet 4.5 model in late September, followed by its Claude Haiku 4.5 model in October. \"The amount that we're releasing to the market and the feedback loops that we're generating from it just make me so unbelievably excited,\" Scott White, product leader for Claude.ai at Anthropic, told CNBC in an interview.Anthropic is an AI startup that was founded by a group of former OpenAI researchers and executives in 2021. Microsoft and Nvidia announced multi-billion-dollar investments in Anthropic last week, boosting the AI lab's valuation to about $350 billion. The company is best known for developing a family of AI models called Claude. It assigns new numbers to the models as they advance across generations, but the largest model in the family is typically called Opus, the midsized model is called Sonnet and the smallest model is Haiku. The last Opus model, which Anthropic released in August, was called Claude Opus 4.1. Read more CNBC tech newsNvidia is king in AI chips, but Google and Amazon want to catch up by making their ownGoogle must double AI compute every 6 months to meet demand, AI infrastructure boss tells employeesFeds charge 4 in plot to export restricted Nvidia chips to China, Hong KongJoby lawsuit accuses air taxi rival Archer of using stolen information to ‘one-up’ dealThe ideal users for Claude Opus 4.5 will be professional software developers and knowledge workers like financial analysts, consultants and accountants, White said. People who are \"excited to push their own creativity, build new things, expand their professional purview\" will also find the model useful, White added. The new model is \"meaningfully better\" at everyday tasks like working with spreadsheets and slides and conducting deep research, Anthropic said in a blog.Claude Opus 4.5 is also state-of-the-art for agentic coding, outperforming rival models like Google's Gemini 3 Pro, which was announced last week, and OpenAI's GPT-5.1, according to SWE-bench Verified, a test set that measures an AI system's software coding abilities. Anthropic said it tested Claude Opus 4.5 on a difficult take-home exam that it gives to prospective performance engineers, and the model scored higher than any human candidate ever had. Claude Opus 4.5 will be available everywhere, and it will be the default model for Anthropic's Pro, Max and Enterprise offerings.In addition to the model launch, Anthropic announced several other product and feature updates on Monday. Claude for Chrome, the startup's extension that allows Claude to take action across browser tabs, is expanding to all Max users, the company said. Claude for Excel, which can understand and edit spreadsheets, is now generally available to all Max, Team and Enterprise users.Anthropic is also bringing Claude Code to its desktop app and adding new capabilities to its developer platform. WATCH: Anthropic valued in range of $350B following investment deal with Microsoft, Nvidiawatch now",

    "body": "Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan (not seen) and the President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy speak during a joint press conference after their official meeting at the Presidential Complex in Ankara, Turkiye on November 19, 2025.Anadolu | Anadolu | Getty ImagesUkrainian officials have spent the weekend scrambling to make up lost ground when it comes to talks with the U.S. over a peace plan to end the war with Russia, with Kyiv having to tread a fine line between showing the U.S. it's willing to engage in discussions, while anxious to safeguard its sovereignty and territorial integrity.Talks between U.S. and Ukrainian officials were held in Switzerland over the weekend after it emerged last week that Russia and the White House had held secret discussions and had devised a 28-point peace plan which largely favored Moscow's demands.The plan, which Ukraine had not participated in, included controversial conditions, including that Ukraine make territorial and military concessions by handing over the eastern Donbas region and reducing its army by 50%, as well as other proposals that crossed Ukraine's \"red lines.\"While media reports about the \"peace plan\" were initially met with a grim silence by Ukraine's president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, and his European allies, some analysts said it amounted to a capitulation to Russia's maximalist territorial demands.Meanwhile, U.S. President Donald Trump issued an ultimatum to Kyiv to respond to the plan by Thursday and Russian President Vladimir Putin signaled his approval of the plan, saying it formed the \"basis of a final peace settlement.\"Breaking his silence on the proposals last Friday, Zelenskyy said Ukraine was facing one of the most difficult moments in its history and was essentially facing a choice between \"losing its dignity or losing a key partner,\" referring to the U.S.Pressured talksTrump turned the screws on Saturday, posting on Truth Social that Ukraine had shown \"zero gratitude\" for the U.S. peace efforts, adding an extra layer of presidential pressure to talks held between the U.S and Ukraine on Sunday.While giving few details away, the discussions, which involved U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and a Ukrainian delegation led by Zelenskyy's top aide, Andriy Yermak, appear to have gone well. Rubio told reporters that both sides had made \"tremendous progress\" with negotiators having drawn up an \"updated and refined peace framework\" that would be worked on this week.While Ukraine may have accepted that NATO membership is unlikely (and this is one of Russia's key demands) this means that postwar security guarantees are crucial for Kyiv.Read moreUkraine has also pushed back on ceding partially occupied Ukrainian territory to Russia and its European allies fearing that Russia would only regroup and stage another invasion in future to capture more of Ukraine. Kyiv has repeated its stance that it needs a \"just and lasting peace\" and not an agreement that won't stand the test of time.Asked about U.S.-Ukraine security guarantees being included in the document, Rubio was vague but told reporters on Sunday:\"I think we all recognize that part of getting a final end to this war will require for Ukraine to feel as if it is safe and it is never going to be invaded or attacked again. So that's clearly something that has to be discussed. I think we've made substantial progress on that and other points.\" U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio speaks to journalists at the John C. Munro Hamilton International Airport after the G7 foreign ministers meeting, in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada Nov. 12, 2025. Mandel Ngan | Via ReutersRubio conceded that the progress of talks with Ukraine was contingent on Russia's approval, stating: \"No matter what we came up with today, obviously, we now have to take what we come up with, if we can reach that agreement with the Ukrainian side to the Russian side, that's another part of this equation. They have to agree to this in order for this to work.\"On Monday, Trump appeared to question progress in talks, posting on Truth Social, \"Is it really possible that big progress is being made in Peace Talks between Russia and Ukraine??? Don't believe it until you see it, but something good just may be happening,\" he said.Red linesFor his part, Zelenskyy said the talks were \"substantive\" and said Monday on social media that, \"right now, it is crucial that every joint action with our partners is throughly thought out. All decisions must be doable in order to ensure lasting peace and guaranteed security ... Together, we will certainly safeguard our shared interests and our people.\"Oleksiy Goncharenko, a Ukrainian lawmaker, told CNBC on Monday that he hoped the latest talks would be fruitful but that security guarantees were \"absolutely vital.\"\"There are some things in this proposal [peace plan] which are unacceptable for Ukraine, there are some things which should be changed but, in general, finally we have a framework and we should work on it and improve it and that's diplomacy,\" Goncharenko told CNBC's \"Squawk Box Europe.\"watch nowAside from security guarantees, other red lines for Ukraine related to the proposal, in the original 28-point plan, that its armed forces hand over parts of the Donbas region, including several large, fortified cities, that they still control.\"I think this is something that's unacceptable for Ukraine because we can't just leave our people,\" Goncharenko said. \"The freezing of the conflict, the peace deal should be reached on the current [front] line, that is something which has been said many times and I think we need to stick to this,\" he said.",

    "body": "Luis Alvarez | Digitalvision | Getty ImagesAs December approaches, some older Americans must soon take required withdrawals from retirement accounts — and mistakes can be costly, according to financial experts. Starting at age 73, most retirees must start required minimum distributions, or RMDs, from pretax accounts, based on your balances, age and an IRS \"life expectancy factor.\" Your first RMD is due by April 1 of the year after turning 73, and Dec. 31 is the deadline for future withdrawals. Waiting until April 1 after turning 73 means you would need two RMDs that year.

The requirements can be difficult to follow amid changing legislation and IRS guidance, experts say.\"RMD mistakes rarely come from neglect. They come from complexity,\" said certified financial planner Scott Van Den Berg, president of advisory firm Century Management in Austin. \"People don't realize how many accounts they have, who's responsible for what or how quickly the rules have changed.\"If you don't take your full RMD by the due date, the penalty is 25% of the amount you should have withdrawn. But that can be reduced to 10% if the RMD is \"timely corrected\" within two years, according to the IRS. Here are some of the biggest RMD mistakes and how to avoid them.  One of the 'biggest mistakes' is waiting  While Dec. 31 is the RMD deadline for most retirees, many investors don't start the process soon enough, according to CFP Tom Geoghegan, founder of Beacon Hill Private Wealth in Summit, New Jersey.\"One of the biggest RMD mistakes is waiting until December to sort everything out,\" he said. \"When retirees rush, they are more likely to miscalculate the [RMD] amount, sell the wrong assets or miss the deadline altogether,\" he said. By starting early, there is more time to verify the year-end balance needed to calculate the RMD, confirm beneficiary details and pick the best way to pull cash from the portfolio, Geoghegan said.Missed accounts When calculating RMDs, you need to consider the requirements for each one and tally each RMD for your final number.  But one of the biggest mistakes is skipping accounts, such as an old 401(k), a forgotten rollover or an inherited individual retirement account from years ago, said Van Den Berg of Century Management.However, you can avoid this error by making a \"master list\" of your accounts every January, including which company holds the assets and the RMD requirements for each one, he said.  watch now'Underused' qualified charitable distributions If you donate money to charity, you can use so-called qualified charitable distributions, or QCDs, which are direct transfers from an IRA to an eligible nonprofit, to reduce RMDs. The move is \"underused\" and can satisfy your yearly RMD, according to Geoghegan of Beacon Hill Private Wealth.    Once you're age 70½ or older, you can use QCDs to donate up to $108,000 in 2025. For married couples filing jointly, spouses aged 70½ or older can also transfer up to $108,000 from their IRA.Another benefit of QCDs is the strategy will \"keep the income off the tax return, which helps with Medicare surcharges,\" Geoghegan said.

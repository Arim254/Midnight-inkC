    "body": "U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent speaks to reporters at the White House in Washington, D.C., Oct. 22, 2025.  Kevin Lamarque | ReutersTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Monday confirmed that the list of candidates to replace Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has been winnowed down to five, with the winner likely to be named by the end of the year.Speaking to reporters on Air Force One, Bessent said the finalists are current Fed Governors Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman, National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett, former Governor Kevin Warsh and BlackRock executive Rick Rieder, according to several media outlets.Those names were reported earlier this month by CNBC.Bessent, who had been rumored to be a top candidate as well, has been conducting interviews and said he expects to do one more round before presenting a \"good slate\" to Trump after the Thanksgiving holiday. Trump himself told reporters that he anticipates naming a replacement by the end of the year, though Powell's term does not expire until May 2026. Powell then either can step down from the Fed entirely, or continue serving a term as governor that lasts until 2028.The Federal Open Market Committee meets this week, with an interest rate decision due Wednesday. Markets are pricing in a near certainty that the committee will lower its benchmark overnight borrowing rate by a quarter percentage point, which would follow a similar cut in September.Trump currently has three appointees on the seven-member Board of Governors: Waller and Bowman, as well as Stephen Miran who is filling an unexpired term that ends in January. Miran, the head of the Council of Economic Advisers who was confirmed in September, is not expected to be reappointed. He has campaigned for the FOMC to be more aggressive in easing.Should Powell opt to leave the Fed, that would give Trump four appointees. He thus far has been unsuccessful in trying to remove Governor Lisa Cook from the board. A rotating cast of five regional presidents joins the governors as voters during the FOMC meeting. ",

Kevin Lamarque | ReutersRussia's testing of an \"invincible\" nuclear-powered cruise missile with a potentially \"unlimited range\" has been met with a less-than impressed response from U.S. President Donald Trump as a new cold front opens up between the countries.Russia announced Sunday that it had successfully tested a new nuclear-powered cruise missile, the 9M730 Burevestnik (or 'Storm Petrel'), on Tuesday last week.It boasted that the missile, which can carry conventional or nuclear warheads, and code-named 'Skyfall' by NATO, can change direction mid-flight and move vertically and horizontally, meaning it can evade missile and air defense systems.President Trump, who's undertaking a whirlwind tour of Asia and is also set to meet Chinese President Xi Jinping on Thursday, was not impressed with the missile launch, telling reporters Monday that Putin should focus on ending the war in Ukraine instead.\"I don't think its an appropriate thing for Putin to be saying, either, by the way: You ought to get the war ended, the war that should have taken one week is now in ... its fourth year, that's what you ought to do instead of testing missiles,\" Trump told reporters on Air Force One on Monday.U.S. President Donald Trump looks on next to people waving Malaysian national flags before he departs on Air Force One from Kuala Lumpur International Airport in Sepang on Oct. 27, 2025.Andrew Caballero-reynolds | Afp | Getty ImagesHe also denigrated the use case for the Russian missile, stating that the U.S. did not need a weapon that could fly so far as it had a nuclear submarine off the coast of Russia.\"They know we have a nuclear submarine, the greatest in the world, right off their shores, so I mean, it doesn't have to go 8,000 miles,\" Trump said, according to an audio file published by the White House.\"They're not playing games with us and we're not playing games with them either,\" Trump added. \"We test missiles all the time.\"The Kremlin responded to that on Monday by saying that \"Russia is consistently working to ensure its own security. It is in line with this objective that the development of new weapons systems, including the aforementioned [Burevestnik] system, is taking place,\" Putin's Press Spokesman Dmitry Peskov said, in comments reported by Russian state media agency TASS.\"Russia must do everything possible to guarantee its own security,\" Peskov added.Test carefully timedThe timing of the test does not appear to be accidental, taking place on the same day that Russia was left humiliated and sidelined after Trump cancelled upcoming talks that were due to be held with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Hungary.Eager to flex its military muscle, and likely a warning to Trump who has been considering whether to give Ukraine long-range Tomahawk missiles capable of striking targets deep within Russia, Moscow declared on Sunday that it had successfully tested its Burevestnik missile.During the test, the missile travelled 14,000 kilometers (or 8,700 miles). It was in the air for about 15 hours and this was \"not the limit,\" Valery Gerasimov, chief of the general staff of Russia's armed forces, told Putin on Sunday, in comments reported by TASS.Putin applauded the test as he visited a command post for troops fighting in Ukraine, where he was briefed on the frontline situation, the Kremlin said in a statement on Sunday.Putin told military officials that such missiles were \"unique products, unmatched anywhere else in the world,\" in comments translated by AP.Russia's President Vladimir Putin and Chief of the General Staff Valery Gerasimov.Grigory Sysoyev | Afp | Getty ImagesRussia says such missiles are part of its nuclear deterrence, with Putin stating Sunday that the country's \"nuclear deterrent is at the highest level. It's probably no exaggeration to say that it's at least higher than that of all nuclear states.\" He added, however, that Russia would now work to put such weapons \"on combat alert.\"On the same day that Russia basked in an apparent show of strength, the Kremlin warned that any strikes inside Russia would be met with an \"overwhelming\" response.Souring relationsRelations between Washington and Moscow took a turn for the worse last week after the White House announced that s planned meeting between Putin and Trump would be postponed indefinitely as the White House leader said he didn't want to \"have a wasted meeting.\"Trump added that the in-person summit was canceled because \"every time I speak to Vladimir, I have good conversations and then they don't go anywhere.\"The announcement was met with a stony silence from the Kremlin as senior Russian officials blamed Western media and \"fake news\" for the abandoned talks, which had been previously been lauded by Russian state media as a coup for Moscow as it vies with Ukraine for Trump's ear, and support.",

Hamad I Mohammed | ReutersTesla Board Chair Robyn Denholm, in a letter Monday, asked shareholders to vote for CEO Elon Musk's nearly $1 trillion pay package ahead of the company's annual meeting.Denholm said Musk was key to the future of the EV maker as it moves beyond being \"just another car company,\" with a bigger focus on Full Self Driving and Optimus.\"Without Elon, Tesla could lose significant value, as our company may no longer be valued for what we aim to become,\" Denholm wrote.Tune in at 8:30 a.m. ET as Tesla Board Chair Robyn Denholm joins CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" to discuss the company's annual meeting and Musk's pay package. Watch in real time on CNBC+ or the CNBC Pro stream.Several groups have publicly opposed the pay package in recent days, with proxy advisor Institutional Shareholder Services recommending against it. Last week, a group of unions and corporate watchdogs launched the Take Back Tesla website to oppose the pay package, noting Musk's embracing of right-wing political movements and amplifying of conspiracy theories that have damaged the brand.Tesla's annual meeting is Nov. 6, with the shareholder vote for Musk's pay and other proposals closing at 11:59 p.m. ET on Nov. 5.Read more CNBC tech newsMusk calls proxy advisory firms 'corporate terrorists.'

    "body": "watch nowPrices that people pay for a variety of goods and services rose less than expected in September, according to a Bureau of Labor Statistics report Friday that keeps the door wide open for another interest rate cut next week.The consumer price index showed a 0.3% increase on the month, putting the annual inflation rate at 3%. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones had been looking for readings of 0.4% and 3.1%, respectively. The annual rate reflected a 0.1 percentage point uptick from August.Excluding food and energy, core CPI showed a 0.2% monthly gain and an annual rate also at 3%, compared with estimates of 0.3% and 3.1%, respectively. Core CPI on a monthly basis had posted 0.3% gains in both July and August.The CPI reading is the only official economic data allowed to be released during the government shutdown.\"Like an oasis slaking the thirst of a weary desert traveler, today's CPI number offered investors the first tidbit of information from the barren wasteland of government data that has existed since the shutdown started Oct 1,\" wrote John Kerschner, global head of securitized products at Janus Henderson. \"Investors were not disappointed. Inflation came in softer than expected, leading to a tepid bond market rally, and ensuring that the Fed will cut rates at next week's Open Market Committee meeting.\"A 4.1% jump in gasoline prices was the largest contributor to a report that otherwise showed inflation pressures fairly muted. Food prices saw a 0.2% increase. Commodity prices overall rose 0.5%. On an annual basis, energy was up 2.8% and food rose 3.1%.Within the food index, prices for meat, poultry, fish and eggs surged 5.2% in the past year, while nonalcoholic beverages increased 5.3%. In energy, while prices pushed higher for electricity, up 5.1%, and natural gas, up 11.7%, over the past year, gasoline prices actually fell 0.5% during the period.Shelter costs, which comprise about one-third of the weighting in the CPI, rose just 0.2% and were up 3.6% from a year ago. Services excluding shelter costs also were 0.2% higher.New vehicles saw a 0.8% increase, but used car and truck prices fell 0.4%.Stock market futures added to gains following the release, while Treasury yields were slightly negative.\"Inflation might not be slowing but it's not surprising to the upside anymore,\" said David Russell, global head of market strategy at TradeStation.The report provides a glimpse into the state of the U.S. economy at a time when all other data releases have been suspended. There were only limited impacts from President Donald Trump's tariffs, though they likely have not made their way fully through the economy yet.watch nowCore goods prices saw just a 0.2% gain on the month. Data within the CPI report, combined with the Customs revenue generated by tariffs, indicate a \"realized\" tariff rate of just 10%, according to James Knightley, chief international economist at ING.There are signs of \"a strong substitution effect already coming through – US companies switching to lower tariff countries for their product sourcing with the composition of imports shifting,\" Knightly wrote.\"The result is companies are better able to absorb these more modest than feared cost increases and there has been less impact on inflation than predicted so far,\" he said. \"In time we expect the realized tariff rate to rise and goods prices to be more heavily impacted, but we continue to argue that tariffs will be a one-off step change in prices rather than something that will lead to more persistent inflation.\"Final report before the FedThe BLS released the data specifically because the Social Security Administration uses it as a benchmark for cost-of-living adjustments, or COLAs, in benefit checks. Otherwise, the federal government has suspended all data compilation and releases until the fiscal impasse in Washington is settled. The CPI report was originally scheduled for release Oct. 15.In addition to providing a COLA guide, the CPI release is the final significant data point the Federal Reserve will get before it makes its interest rate decision next week. The Fed has a 2% inflation goal. The headline measure was last below that level in February 2021.A shopper looks at a sales advertisement at a grocery store in West Milton, Ohio, US, on Tuesday, Oct. 21, 2025. Kyle Grillot | Bloomberg | Getty Images\"This report will clearly keep the Fed on track to cut rates,\" said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B. Riley Wealth. \"The Fed has been clear that they are more focused on the softening labor data and will continue to defend their full employment mandate, even with core CPI well above their 2% target.\"Markets are pricing in a near-certainty that the central bank lowers its benchmark overnight borrowing rate by a quarter percentage point from its current target range of 4%-4.25%. Traders also are anticipating another cut in December.However, the path after that is much less clear.Worries persist that Trump's tariffs could cause another round of painful inflation. At the same time, Fed policymakers worry that a slump in hiring this year could spread, though layoffs remain low.Tariff-sensitive apparel prices saw a 0.7% increase in September, while durable goods moved 0.3% higher.Fed Chair Jerome Powell and his colleagues have expressed generally cautious tones about the pace of rate cuts as they weigh the threat of inflation against weakness in the labor market. For his part, Trump has insisted that inflation is no longer a problem and the Fed should be cutting aggressively.",

He went on to become a co-founder and CEO of work management software platform Asana the same year.Moskovitz announced his departure as Asana's CEO earlier this year and has transitioned into the role of chairman, while retaining an ownership of 53% of the company's outstanding shares between Class A and Class B holdings. The billionaire recently opened up about what it was like to be a CEO at Asana, while also having an introverted personality, on an episode of the Stratechery podcast by Ben Thompson, released on Monday.\"I don't like to manage teams, and it wasn't my intention when we started Asana,\" Moskovitz said during the episode.\"I'd intended to be more of a independent or head of engineering or something again. Then one thing led to another and I was CEO for 13 years and I just found it quite exhausting.\"He added: \"I'm an introvert, I had to just kind of put on this face day after day and then in the beginning I was like, 'Oh, it's going to get easier, the company will get more mature,' and then the world just kept getting more chaotic — the first Trump presidency and the pandemic and all the race stuff, it made it just a lot less of the company building, being a CEO is a lot more reacting to problems and doing this sort of thing.\"Many famous leaders are introvertsVarious notable business leaders have described themselves as being introverts, from Meta's Zuckerberg, to Microsoft's co-founder Bill Gates, and chairman and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway Warren Buffett.Susan Cain, author of \"Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking\" said introverts are often passed over for leadership positions and thrive more in quieter and less stimulating environments.She said introverts have some hidden traits that can make them well suited for leadership positions, including taking fewer risks, being more creative, and being better at problem solving.Cain said that introverted leaders can be \"slow\" and \"circumspect\" when making decisions which helps them to avoid impulsive or reckless moves.They also tend to seek out solitude more which is \"a real catalyst to creativity,\" according to Cain.\"This two-tier structure of how we view personality leads to a colossal waste of talent, and of energy and of happiness,\" Cain said. \"We need to be adopting much more of a yin and yang approach of balance between the two styles.\"",

When you're going to squeeze lemonade out of horses---, you've got to squeeze really, really hard ... To create something from nothing, there is no such thing.\"Liautaud speaks from experience: Despite graduating second-to-last in his high school class, he created a billion-dollar brand, he said. He launched his first sandwich shop in Charleston, Illinois in 1983, as a 19-year-old with a $25,000 loan from his father — and spent the next 36 years carefully and persistently growing his business, he told the \"American Optimist\" podcast during an October 2024 episode.In his first 10 years of business, for example, Liautaud only opened stores that he operated himself — 10 of them, all in Illinois, he said. From that foundation, he eventually franchised out additional locations across the country. Jimmy John's now has over 2,600 locations across 45 states.In September 2016, Liautaud sold his majority stake in the company, 65% of the business, to Atlanta-based private equity firm Roark Capital Group at a valuation of \"about $3.5 billion,\" he said in the TikTok video. He stepped down as chairman in October 2019, after Roark-owned Inspire Brands acquired the rest of Jimmy John's for an undisclosed sum.DON'T MISS: The ultimate guide to using AI to communicate betterAs with any business, the sandwich chain's growth path was hardly linear or straightforward, Liautaud noted. In 2002, for example, 70 of the then-200 Jimmy John's locations were struggling to become profitable, he said.His response: Teach the franchise owners a lesson in work ethic, he said. \"I said, 'If you're going to go into the sandwich business, this is 24/7 365. If you're in the cattle business, cattle need to get fed on Sunday. They need to get fed on Christmas day,'\" said Liautaud.\"I started telling people the truth about the business,\" he continued. \"If you're going to do this, you better be ready to be a grinder.\"Liautaud currently has an estimated net worth of $2.4 billion, according to Forbes.Other highly successful entrepreneurs built their businesses using a similar mindset. Bill Gates didn't believe in vacations or weekends during Microsoft's early days, and Elon Musk has been known to occasionally sleep at the office and work throughout the night. Nvidia co-founder and CEO Jensen Huang works \"from the moment I wake up to the moment I go to sleep,\" he said during a May 2024 interview with Stripe CEO Patrick Collision.Now, some of them opt for more sleep and better time-management. Gates regrets his previous workaholic lifestyle, he told students at Northern Arizona University's commencement ceremony in May 2023.\"Don't wait as long as I did to learn this lesson,\" Gates said. \"Take time to nurture your relationships. To celebrate your successes. And to recover from your losses. Take a break when you need to.

    "body": "Gold prices were flat in Asia trade on Wednesday as investors held back from placing large bets ahead of the U.S. Federal Reserve's policy decision, while also keeping a close watch on the developments surrounding the Israel-Iran conflict. Anindito Mukherjee | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesThe narrow lanes of Zaveri Bazaar, one of the oldest jewelers' markets in India's financial capital, Mumbai, grew even more congested this Diwali as crowds jostled to buy gold on the auspicious first day of the festival of lights.But there was a twist.Most of the people thronging the market were there to buy gold coins or bars — not jewelry — Mahavir Kothari, a wholesaler of precious metals in Zaveri Bazaar told CNBC.Leading gems and jewelry trade bodies in India told CNBC that more than 40 tons of gold was sold in the country on Oct. 19, the first day of Diwali.About 700 billion rupees ($8 billion) to 1 trillion rupees ($11 billion) worth of gold was sold during the five-day festival that ended Thursday, according to India Bullion and Jewellers Association, or IBJA, and All India Gem and Jewellery Domestic Council, or GJC.Ajay Chawla, chief executive officer of one of India's largest jewelry chains, Tanishq, reportedly warned his firm could run out of gold coins and bars due to the festive-season demand.A few years ago, out of 10 customers, only one would opt for a coin or gold bar, said Surendra Mehta, National Secretary at IBJA, but this is slowly changing. He added that according to the estimates of his trade body, sales of jewelry had dropped by about 30% this festive season compared to last year.The enthusiasm among Indians over buying gold for investments has been rooted in their search for returns. Gold this year had risen 66% by mid-October, before seeing a sharp slide — it was still up 55% as of Monday. Earlier this month, gold prices smashed past $4,000 an ounce, with some industry experts forecasting the yellow metal to touch $5,000 in 2026.India is the second largest purchaser of gold after China, according to data from the World Gold Council, which shows the country has been a consistent buyer for years, driven by traditional demand for gold during the festive (October) and wedding seasons (October to mid-January and April to May).Gold jewellery in a shop in Kolkata, India.Sonali Pal Chaudhury | Nurphoto | Getty ImagesAs global central banks increase their gold purchases, fueling a surge in prices, the yellow metal is increasingly attracting retail investors who fear missing out on the boom.Goldman Sachs in a report on Sept. 30 said that central banks, particularly in emerging markets, have increased their pace of gold purchases by roughly fivefold since 2022, when Russia's foreign-currency reserves were frozen following its invasion of Ukraine.\"We view this as a structural shift in reserve management behavior, and we do not expect a near-term reversal,\" the report said.These sharp gains in gold prices are making Indians see gold not just as a consumption product, but a key investment asset, experts said.Earlier, when gold demand was largely driven by consumption and prices of jewelry rose, consumers would cut back on spending, said Anindya Banerjee, head of commodity and currency markets at Kotak Securities. But elevated prices have not curbed the overall demand for gold this festive season.Rajesh Rokde, chairman of GJC said that volume-wise sales for all five days of Diwali were just about 5% lower compared to last year, despite significantly higher prices.Gold currently trades at $4,073 per ounce.\"India's households wealth held in gold is estimated at $3.8tn/ 88.8% of GDP,\" said Morgan Stanley in a report on Oct. 9. \"This is providing a positive wealth effect, even as benign macro stability ensures that flow of gold demand remains range bound,\" it added.Gold is a good hedge against falling rupee and any weakness in Indian equity markets, said Mukesh Jindal, senior partner at wealth management firm Alpha Capital that handles assets of more than 100 billion rupees for family offices and high net worth individuals in India.Investments include purchasing gold bars, coins, exchange traded funds and even digital gold. In September, inflows into gold ETFs rose more than six-fold to (83.63 billion rupees) from a year earlier, according to data from the Association of Mutual Funds in India.The rally in gold is likely to continue as central banks across the world remain net buyers of the metal month on month, Jindal said, adding that he has been advising clients to allocate 5%-10% of their portfolio to gold. That is still conservative compared to Bridgewater Associates' founder and billionaire Ray Dalio's advise earlier this month of allocating as much as 15% of one's portfolio to gold.",

    "body": "Signage for Novartis AG at a building in the company's headquarters campus in Basel, Switzerland, on Monday, Jan. 8, 2023. Bloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesSwiss pharmaceutical giant Novartis has agreed to buy biotechnology company Avidity Biosciences for about $12 billion, the company said Sunday.Novartis will pay Avidity shareholders $72 a share in cash, a premium of 46% to the company's Friday closing price.The deal is expected to close in the first half of 2026, after Avidity spins out parts of its business, including its early-stage precision cardiology programs, the company said in a statement. \"The Avidity team has built robust programs with industry-leading delivery of RNA therapeutics to muscle tissue,\" Novartis CEO Vas Narasimhan said in the statement. \"We look forward to developing these programs to meaningfully change the trajectory of diseases for patients.\"Novartis has raised the forecast for its sales compound annual growth rate between 2024 and 2029 to 6% from 5% as a result of the acquisition.Bloomberg News first reported the companies were nearing a deal, citing a person familiar with the matter. Novartis and Avidity didn't immediately respond to CNBC's requests for comment.Avidity specializes in developing an innovative class of ribonucleic acid (RNA) therapeutics called antibody oligonucleotide conjugates. RNA-based therapeutics are a relatively new class of medications that work by altering how genes are expressed to treat or prevent diseases.The Avidity deal comes as Novartis ramps up its research and development division. The company earlier this year pledged to invest $23 billion to build out its U.S.-based infrastructure, which includes plans to construct a second R&D hub in San Diego.The pharmaceutical giant has also struck two key deals with Anthos Therapeutics and Regulus Therapeutics this year to boost its development and manufacturing of cardiovascular and kidney disease drugs.Avidity shares closed at $49.15 on Friday. The stock, which has a market capitalization of roughly $7.2 billion, is up nearly 70% since the beginning of the year. Novartis shares closed at $130.36 on Friday.",

Salwan Georges | The Washington Post | Getty ImagesBig Tech and other publicly traded companies are helping to finance the $300 million White House ballroom planned by President Donald Trump.The White House East Wing has been demolished to make room for the 90,000 square foot ballroom, sparking public anger after Trump promised in July that the building would not be impacted.Trump has said the construction of the ballroom will be financed by his own funds and corporate and individual donors at no cost to the taxpayer. The president said Wednesday the project will cost $300 million, up from an initial estimate of $200 million.Trump has not said how much he is spending. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters on Thursday that the president will disclose his contribution.The White House has released a list of donors that include Amazon, Alphabet, Apple, Microsoft and Meta.Alphabet is contributing $22 million which represents about 7% of the project's estimated cost. Its contribution is the result of a settlement reached with Trump last month over a lawsuit he filed against YouTube for banning him from the platform after a riot by his supporters against Congress on Jan. 6, 2021.The settlement notes that $22 million will be contributed on Trump's behalf \"to the Trust for the National Mall, a 501(c)(3) tax-exempt entity dedicated to restoring, preserving, and elevating the National Mall, to support the construction of the White House State Ballroom.\"Donors also include Palantir, Micron, Coinbase, Lockheed Martin, Continental Resources founder Harold Hamm, and Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, according to the White House list.\"Lockheed Martin is grateful for the opportunity to help bring the President's vision to reality and make this addition to the People's House, a powerful symbol of the American ideals we work to defend every day,\" a company spokesperson said in a statement.Comcast, CNBC's current parent company, is also on the donor list.

    "body": "European consumers are facing higher prices when going to the supermarket.Andia | Universal Images Group | Getty ImagesRelations between the the U.K. and European Union are arguably at the best they've been since the Brexit vote in 2016 but there's an ongoing cold front between the neighbors over a ban on continental cheese and meat imports.In April, Britain banned people from bringing all dairy products and a range of meats from the EU into the country for personal consumption, saying the prohibition was needed in order to prevent the possible spread of Foot and Mouth Disease among British livestock after outbreaks in Europe earlier this year.British holidaymakers travelling to the continent were warned not to bring home foodstuffs such as cheese, chorizo, Serrano ham or sandwiches containing any of a wide range of banned products, even if they were sealed or bought in duty-free shops at airports. The ban extends to cakes, biscuits and chocolate containing a high level of unprocessed dairy products or fresh cream.Those found with banned items were told they'd have to surrender them at the border, or have them seized and destroyed. Anyone flouting the restriction could receive a £5,000 fine (around $6,700), the government said.The Brits' ban did not apply to commercial food imports because they undergo more stringent biosecurity requirements, such as heat treatment and veterinary health certificates, the U.K. said.Cheese shops in Paris — and particularly those situated around the Gare du Nord where Eurostar trains travel to and from the U.K. — say the restrictions have hit sales to a vital customer base.\"Tourists are very important, and especially English people,\" Alexandre Vilaca, founder and manager of Fromagerie Ferdinand in Paris, told CNBC, noting that when he opened his cheese shop eight years ago, he had chosen the Gare du Nord neighborhood for its international visitors.\"These past few years, it was very important to have English clients. We vacuum-packed the cheese so they could travel easily to the U.K., and we started to have regular clients who used to pass by our shop in order to bring some gifts to the families and friends ... But a few months ago, clients told me that it was forbidden to bring cheese back home,\" he said.\"And it's had a huge impact on our sales to U.K. clients,\" he added.A cheesemonger working in a cheese store in Paris, France, in 2022. Bloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesVilaca said the ban was largely nonsensical, given that the French authorities were \"very, very strict\" about sanitary controls and regular checks on cheese producers, their products and their distribution. English cheese producers Vilaca worked with were also upset by the ban, he noted.\"We are proud when clients take home some souvenirs, maybe some wine, some cheese — a bit of France in their bags, so to speak. So we don't understand [the ban], we are quite upset and it is bad news because, in terms of business, it's not great.\"Why the ban?Temporary bans on continental food products entering or exiting the U.K., or vice versa, are nothing new and it's worth noting that the EU introduced a permanent ban on Brits bringing animal and dairy products, for personal consumption, into the bloc following Brexit for the same reasons: to prevent the spread of diseases.Foot and Mouth Disease, or FMD, is a serious concern for a close-knit continent like the EU as it can spread very quickly, particularly given the region's interconnected agricultural market and multiple transmission routes.FMD does not pose a risk to humans but is highly contagious to cattle, sheep and pigs, with the disease able to spread rapidly among livestock, with devastating consequences.Outbreaks of FMD were confirmed in Germany, Hungary and Slovakia earlier this year but they were contained after the countries' rapidly implemented animal health control measures in the affected establishments, including the culling of livestock and protection and surveillance zones.Not taking any chances: Cars pass through at a disinfection checkpoint set up on the border crossing between Hungary and Slovakia on March 28, 2025 in Medvedov, Slovakia. The country declared a state of emergency after several cases of foot and mouth disease in the region, including a new outbreak detected in Hungary, close to the Slovak border near Bratislava.Robert Nemeti | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesThose emergency measures were lifted after Germany was declared free of FMD in April, and Hungary and Slovakia have seen no new outbreaks since April.In late July, the U.K. government's Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs (Defra) said in an assessment that \"while the incursions of FMD into Europe earlier in the year were undoubtedly concerning, there have been no further reports since April, suggesting that the situation in Hungary and Slovakia is under control.\"While the report's authors said the risk of incursion of FMD to the U.K. was, in July, was considered a 'low (rare but can occur)' risk, the report cautioned that FMD can remain undetected for several months.The U.K. government told CNBC that, despite the containment of European FMD outbreaks, the ongoing ban on personal imports of cheese and many meats aimed to protect British farmers and U.K. food security.\"Earlier this year, we took immediate action to ban personal imports of meat and dairy from Europe after a wave of foot and mouth cases. We are also investing £1 billion [$1.3 billion] in a new National Biosecurity Centre to boost our world leading facilities and protect our farmers, food supply and economy,\" a spokesman for Defra told CNBC.\"We will do whatever it takes to protect our farmers from animal disease,\" the spokesperson added.Almost six months into the ban, however, and questions are being asked whether the ongoing restrictions are excessive, and no longer necessary.Defra stressed its not alone in implementing the current restrictions, and is only doing what the EU has been doing for several years, since Brexit, as standard practice.Asked when the ban might be lifted, given that cases of FMD are now contained on the continent, Defra said the government's \"FMD response remains under constant review\" and that it will \"retain restrictions in England while personal imports of affected products pose biosecurity risks to Great Britain.\"Hard lessonsThe U.K. and EU have learned the hard way what an outbreak of FMD can cause.Cows of Breier Cattle Farm are pictured at a farm near Budapest on March 11, 2025. Hungary detected its first foot-and-mouth disease outbreak in over 50 years on March 7, 2025, at a cattle farm near the Slovak border. The country's food safety agency, introduced extremely strict measures to prevent the further spread of the disease, including a ban on the movement of susceptible species. Ferenc Isza | Afp | Getty ImagesThe 2001 epidemic, which first broke out in the U.K. before spreading to the continent, had a devastating impact on the British farming community with over six million animals having to be destroyed and estimated to have cost the U.K.'s public and private sector a combined £8 billion.In the EU, four million animals were destroyed and the outbreak is estimated to have cost member states 2.7 billion euros in terms of eradication measures and compensation to farmers.The U.K.'s last outbreak, in 2007, only affected eight farms but was estimated to have cost £147 million overall, due to large-scale livestock movement bans.",

    "body": "In an aerial view, a container ship sits docked at the Port of Oakland on October 10, 2025 in Oakland, California.Justin Sullivan | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesShares of several U.S.-listed rare earth miners fell on Monday as U.S. officials said they expect China to delay introducing export controls on critical minerals as part of a broader trade deal.Critical Metals fell more than 10% in premarket trade, USA Rare Earth declined 8.6%, MP Materials was down 5.7% and Trilogy Metals lost 8%. Energy Fuels and NioCorp Developments, meanwhile, traded 4% and 6% lower, respectively.U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told NBC News' \"Meet The Press\" on Sunday that Washington and Beijing were expected to reach a deal to avoid a new 100% U.S. tariff on Chinese goods, with Beijing set to defer on imposing strict rare earth export controls.His comments come ahead of a high-stakes meeting between Chinese leader Xi Jinping and U.S. President Donald Trump on Thursday.Trump on Monday said that the U.S. and China were set to \"come away with\" a trade deal. Speaking aboard Air Force One en route to Japan amid a weeklong Asia trip, Trump said that he had \"a lot of respect for President Xi.\"watch nowThe U.S. president had previously threatened to impose new tariffs of 100% on imports from China starting from Nov. 1, adding at the time that the White House would also slap export controls on \"any and all critical software.\"China, for its part, announced a new framework earlier this month for restricting rare earth exports. The move was seen as a stark warning to the West — and a reflection of the deepening mistrust between Beijing and Washington.To be sure, China is the undisputed leader of the critical minerals supply chain, producing nearly 70% of the world's supply of rare earths from mines and processing almost 90%, which means it is importing these materials from other countries and refining them.\"Details are still limited, and nothing will be finalized until the Trump-Xi meeting,\" Wolfe Research analyst Tobin Marcus told clients in an Oct. 26 note.\"But a renewed truce now seems near-certain, with China likely fully delaying their rare earth export controls for a year—better than the alternative of an agreement to grant licenses,\" Marcus said.— CNBC's Michael Bloom contributed to this report.",

    "body": "watch nowThe Disability Awareness Council in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, assists individuals with disabilities in the community, offering aid ranging from transportation to housing advocacy. But for now, many services are on hold.\"Because of the shutdown and cuts, core disability services that people rely on every week are either paused, reduced or running with unpaid labor,\" said Timothy Miles, the organization's director and board liaison.As the standoff in Washington drags on, many nonprofits have lost access to federal grants and must make tough decisions about what aid they can offer and for how long.At the same time, the shutdown has put some federal assistance, such as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, at risk just when the need for help is increasing. With hundreds of thousands of federal employees and contract workers furloughed and without pay, that adds to the strain on nonprofits that are needed to help fill the gap.\"Nonprofits are on the frontlines of serving communities, but a government shutdown makes it harder for them to fulfill their missions,\" said Diane Yentel, president and CEO of the National Council of Nonprofits, an industry association. \"The longer this shutdown lasts, the more people and communities are left without the critical services they depend on,\" she said.The current government shutdown is now the second-longest federal funding lapse in U.S. history.Read more CNBC personal finance coverageGovernment shutdown curtails nonprofit funding, putting services in jeopardyMore investors are interested in alts — advisors say there's an easy way inHere's the inflation breakdown for September 2025 — in one chartInherited IRAs have a key change for 2025.

The organization has a workforce of seven and serves hundreds of people in the area.'Real long-term consequences'The longer the shutdown continues, the harder it will be for nonprofits to continue serving their communities, Saadian said.  In many cases, if an organization lays off staff or puts a program or service on pause, it can be difficult to resume operations once the shutdown ends and funding kicks in.\"Once those organizations suffer those kinds of impacts, there can be real long-term consequences, because they've lost that infrastructure, they've lost that staff,\" Saadian said.Subscribe to CNBC on YouTube.",

    "body": "watch nowIRVINE, Calif. — Taco Bell is going all in on beverages, starting with its Live Más Café concept.The Yum Brands chain unveiled the drink-focused store format last December, with the first location in Chula Vista, California. Ten months later came the second location, near the University of California, Irvine campus. By the end of the year, Taco Bell is projecting that it will have 30 Live Más Cafés in its portfolio, across Southern California, Dallas and Houston.Unlike McDonald's now-defunct CosMc's spinoff, which had its own standalone locations, the Live Más Café lives inside existing Taco Bell restaurants. Customers order at kiosks and can watch the \"bellristas\" assemble their drinks from behind the designated counter, which takes prime real estate in the store. The drink menu includes a range of beverage options, from blended coffees to lemonade-based drinks.The beverage-focused concept is supposed to help the Mexican-inspired chain reach its goal of generating a $5 billion drink business by 2030. Taco Bell first disclosed that target in March at an investor day, where the chain shared more about its plans to keep growing as it fuels Yum's operating profit growth.So far this year, Taco Bell has sold more than 600 million beverages, up 16% from the year-ago period, according to the company. More than 60% of the chain's orders this year have included a drink, Taco Bell said.\"I think drinks are big right now because I think people are really craving unique, interesting flavors in their beverages, and we hear that all the time from our consumers,\" said Liz Matthews, global chief food innovation officer for Taco Bell.Center stageTaco Bell's Live Más Café.Courtesy: Taco BellStepping inside the Irvine location, the Live Más Café beverage station is the clear star.Most of the self-order kiosks are positioned in front of the station's long counter. Customers have a free view of the \"bellristas\" making their specialty drinks, unlike the restaurant's other employees who assemble Crunchwrap Supremes and Chalupas hidden from sight.Digital menu boards across the restaurant highlight the beverage offerings. The drink menu spans four distinct categories: churro chillers, specialty coffees, refrescas and \"bellrista favorites.\"The churro chillers are creamy and cold milkshakes topped with churro chunks. The specialty coffees come either hot, iced or blended as a \"chiller.\" Brightly colored refrescas use either lemonade, green tea or Rockstar energy drinks as the base for their fruity flavors, such as strawberry passionfruit or mango peach. And the \"bellrista favorites\" include seasonal options, such as the autumnal caramel apple empanada churro chiller, which incorporates blended chunks of Taco Bell's apple empanada.When crafting the menu, Matthews and her team tried to stick to the chain's Mexican-inspired roots, but she said Taco Bell will always have a \"playful spirit.\"And while the Live Más Café offers plenty of options with a variety of flavors, Taco Bell kept the options to customize minimal.\"What we found when we talked to consumers, they actually really want us to curate their drink for them,\" Matthews said.To date, the Irvine location's top-selling drinks are the Mexican Chocolate Churro Chiller, the Dirty Mountain Dew Baja Blast Dream Soda and the Mango Peach Agua Refresca. Six of the top 10 bestselling drinks at the location are chillers. That's a reversal from the initial test location in Chula Vista, which has seen similar demand for every drink category, according to Matthews.Since its opening day in September, the Irvine location has been selling more than 900 drinks per day, according to Taco Bell. More than a third of orders include an item from the Live Más Café menu.Meanwhile, the Chula Vista location — which exceeded its initial sales forecast by four times — is selling more than 750 beverages a day nearly a year since its opening, the company said. A quarter of all transactions include a Live Más Café beverage, according to Taco Bell.\"Given what we're seeing right now from the business results, the payback looks really attractive and in line with what our franchisees would expect for something big, but we've got a lot more to learn,\" said Taylor Montgomery, global chief brand officer of Taco Bell.'Little treat'This year, the hottest trend in fast food hasn't been a chicken sandwich or plant-based burgers. Instead, beverages of all consistencies, colors and nutritional values have taken the spotlight.For example, Shake Shack is selling lemonade with mini raspberry popping boba, inspired by the success of bubble tea. Panera Bread is testing frescas and energy refreshers in select bakery-cafés. Chick-fil-A is planning to open Daybright — a beverage-focused restaurant with specialty coffees, smoothies and cold-pressed juices — in Hiram, Georgia, later this year. And although McDonald's this summer wound down its spin-off called CosMc's that focused on drinks and snacks, it also tested new coffee drinks, refreshers and flavored sodas at more than 500 U.S. restaurants.The number of beverages sold by the top 500 chains has climbed more than 9% in the last year, according to Technomic. The swell of beverage innovation follows the speedy expansion of a number of a specialty drink chains, from upstart 7 Brew Coffee to dirty-soda inventor Swig.\"[Quick-service chains] have seen that there's a big opportunity with an entire generation and how they're interested in that 'little treat' culture,\" said Claire Conaghan, \"trendologist\" at Datassential, which tracks menu trends. \"There's options to kind of go beyond their focus area of core meal and really lean into that snacking moment.\"Generation Z and millennials are driving the trend, according to Varchasvi Singh, a foodservice analyst for Mintel. Younger generations enjoy customizing their food and beverage orders.\"Among younger consumers, in particular, we see that fast-food dining is just as much about experimentation and novelty as it is about indulgence,\" Singh said. \"They're a lot more open to trying premium menu items and personalizing their orders, whereas older generations, who have associated fast food with extreme affordability for a long time, are a little bit more critical of how expensive it has become for them.\"For Taco Bell, turning to beverages and creating the Live Más Café is part of its broader plan to appeal to younger consumers, whose spending power is projected to increase rapidly in just a few years.\"Over the past five years, we've really, really been transitioning and thinking about the brand and how to position it for Gen Z, and so Café was really born from that,\" Montgomery said. \"I think it's something like 60% of Gen Z consumers come to a restaurant or [quick-service restaurant] for an afternoon treat.\"Rather than creating a standalone Live Más Café, Taco Bell chose to put the sub-brand inside existing restaurants in part because of \"humility,\" according to Montgomery.\"Today, we're not known to be a beverage destination — yet,\" he told CNBC.Live Más Café can also help Taco Bell more broadly.\"It also acts a little bit as a test market where they can get some more real-time data. Which combos do people do the most?\" Conaghan said. \"Which customizations matter the most? Do we need every type of alternative milk or maybe just these one or two? Do we need all 15 flavors of whatever energy refresher?\"That's already started happening. Taco Bell's agua frescas, which began as a Live Más Café menu line, have since been launched nationwide.\"They're one of our top-selling items, and we didn't wait to scale the Café,\" Montgomery said. \"We pushed those in all the restaurants, and we've seen success there.\"Plus, the coffee options on the café's menu are part of Taco Bell's plan to make a bigger push into breakfast. The chain started serving the morning meal more than a decade ago but told franchisees last year that they could opt out serving breakfast; for some fast-food operators, opening early isn't profitable, plus there's the added headache of finding staff willing to work the morning shift.Taco Bell has already had some success with another sub-brand. Its Cantina format, typically found in cities, features a custom menu, alcoholic beverages and seating meant to encourage customers to linger. Since opening the first location in Chicago a decade ago, Taco Bell Cantina has grown to dozens of restaurants.Broadly, even as inflation-weary consumers pull back their spending, Taco Bell's focus on new menu items has lifted its sales; earlier this year, the company announced plans to double innovation in 2025. Taco Bell's prices have climbed 75.5% since 2019, according to Technomic's Ignite Menu. Still, customers keep coming back.In recent years, Taco Bell has been the gem of Yum's portfolio, typically outperforming both Wall Street's expectations and its sister chains, KFC and Pizza Hut. Executives have named the chain as one of the company's primary growth engines. In the second quarter, while many fast-food rivals reported shrinking sales, Taco Bell reported same-store sales growth of 4%.\"From a portfolio standpoint, we represent a pretty significant amount of Yum's operating profit, but we learn a lot from other brands, too,\" Montgomery said.Yum is expected to report its third-quarter earnings before the bell on Nov 4.Watch the video to learn more about why Taco Bell is betting on drinks.",

    "body": "A view of the logo of HSBC bank on a wall outside a branch in Mexico City, Mexico, on June 14, 2024.Henry Romero | ReutersHSBC said on Monday that it will recognize a provision of $1.1 billion in its third quarter results following a court ruling in Luxembourg related to the Bernard Madoff investment fraud case.Herald Fund SPC sued HSBC's Luxembourg unit in 2009, claiming restitution of securities and cash it said were lost in the fraud.The court denied HSBC unit's appeal in respect of Herald's securities restitution claim, but accepted the unit's appeal in respect of the cash restitution claim.The bank will now pursue a second appeal before the Luxembourg Court of Appeal, and added that if unsuccessful, it would contest the amount to be paid in subsequent proceedings.HSBC shares in Hong Kong closed down 1.1%, while its London-listed stock was last trading 1.3% lower.Madoff was described as the mastermind of the largest investment fraud in U.S., defrauding clients of as much as $65 billion. He pleaded guilty in 2009 to a scheme that started in the early 1970s, ripping off more than 40,000 people in 125 countries over four decades, before being caught on Dec. 11, 2008.Madoff, whose victims included director Steven Spielberg and actor Kevin Bacon, was sentenced to 150 years in prison. He passed away in 2021.In its interim report for 2025 released in July, HSBC said Herald had claimed a restitution of securities and cash of $2.5 billion plus interest, or damages of $5.6 billion plus interest from HSBC.HSBC, Europe's largest lender, said that various non-U.S. HSBC companies provided custodial, administration and similar services to a number of funds whose assets were invested with Bernard Madoff Investment Securities.The news comes a day before HSBC is due to announce its results, with the bank saying that the $1.1 billion provision will impact its Common Equity Tier 1, or CET1, ratio by about 15 basis points. The CET1 ratio is a measure of a bank's financial strength, and is used to determine its ability to withstand distress.Estimates from analysts compiled by the bank on Oct. 17 had forecast CET1 ratio for the third quarter to come in at 14.5%, compared to 14.6% in the second quarter.Lorraine Tan, director of equity research for Asia at Morningstar, told CNBC that she does not think that the $1.1 billion charge would have an impact on operations, but it could weigh on sentiment slightly as HSBC was \"hoping that these one-off impairments were cleaned up after the interim write-offs.\"HSBC's allowance for expected credit losses as of June increased by $500 million compared with Dec. 31, including adverse foreign exchange movements of 400 million, and write-offs of $2 billion, according to the bank's interim report.Morningstar's assumption is that HSBC CET1 ratio will be at around 14.4% for the third quarter, and hover at the 14% over the next 10 years.HSBC, which said that the final financial impact from the ruling could be \"significantly different,\" given the pending appeals, is currently undergoing a restructuring under CEO Georges Elhedery, and will see the bank split its operations into four divisions.The bank has said the reorganization will cut costs by about $300 million this year, creating separate \"Eastern markets\" and \"Western markets\" sectors.— CNBC's Marty Steinberg and Scott Cohn contributed to this report.",

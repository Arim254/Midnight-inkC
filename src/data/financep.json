Because it was smart.\"In 1992, the Queens, New York, native co-founded the clothing brand — an acronym for \"For Us, By Us\" — following a humble upbringing with his single mom. John launched the company with just $40, and the money he made as a waiter at the chain restaurant helped keep him afloat and invest in his business.\"That job taught me sales and inventory, paid my bills [and] bought fabric and materials for my business,\" wrote John, 56.DON'T MISS: How to build custom GPTs and use AI agentsFUBU rose to popularity in the early 1990s alongside a flourishing hip-hop and rap scene. John took his apparel to music video shoots and got rappers to take photos in his gear, he's said. In 1996, he put out an ad seeking funding for his business and landed a distribution deal with Samsung, he told Business Insider in February 2018. That investment reportedly helped FUBU bring in $30 million in sales in three months.The urban streetwear brand has since brought in more than $6 billion in total revenue to date, according to John's website. John, a longtime investor judge on ABC's \"Shark Tank,\" still serves as the company's CEO.'Build slow if you have to'While launching a business or side hustle, you may be inclined to quit your job, especially if you've already brought in a bit of money — or you're just tired of your 9-to-5. Experts typically recommend a couple considerations before taking that risk.Those considerations include a strong business plan — clearly stating what the product or service is, who'll buy it and the money you'll be making — and enough money to sustain yourself as you establish your business, according to Kevin Lao, a certified financial planner and founder of advising firm Imagine Financial Security. Lao saved up a year's worth of living expenses and three months of business expenses before launching his firm, he told CNBC in January 2022. And he was clear on his company's vision, he added.\"It's very hard to be successful if you don't have a very compelling 'why,'\" Lao said.For John, his waiter job — though it wasn't glamorous — set the foundation for his approach to entrepreneurship and taught him an important lesson, he wrote.\"People don't realize it, but sometimes the day job is your first investor,\" John wrote. \"Don't get discouraged if you don't have the means to quit your job right away.

The crackdown on immigration enforcement by federal agents in Minnesota \"has had, and will likely continue to have, profound and even heartbreaking consequences,\" U.S. District Judge Katherine Menendez said in the ruling.Menendez did not issue a decision on whether the activity itself was lawful. Rather, she said that the plaintiffs failed to meet the standard required for an emergency order to stop activity immediately, according to the ruling.The decision comes amid widespread protests and backlash against federal immigration enforcement activity in the state, especially after fatal shootings by immigration agents in Minneapolis resulting in the deaths of U.S. citizens Renée Good and Alex Pretti.Attorney General Pam Bondi called the ruling \"HUGE.\" \"Neither sanctuary policies nor meritless litigation will stop the Trump Administration from enforcing federal law in Minnesota,\" she said in a post on X.",

    "body": "U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) speaks during the annual \"March for Life\" in Washington, D.C., U.S., Jan. 23, 2026. Aaron Schwartz | ReutersHouse Speaker Mike Johnson on Sunday said he believes he has the votes to end the partial government shutdown by Tuesday, with the House set to take up a Senate-approved spending package this week. \"Let's say I'm confident that we'll do it at least by Tuesday,\" the Louisiana Republican said on NBC's \"Meet the Press.\" The U.S. government partially shut down on Saturday morning after Congress failed to approve a spending package and send it to President Donald Trump by the Jan. 30 deadline. Senate Democrats demanded changes to the package that the House originally passed after two U.S. citizens were shot and killed by federal immigration agents in Minnesota. Democrats ultimately had the Department of Homeland Security funding stripped from the package and replaced with two-week stopgap funding for the agency. Now, the amended package has to be reapproved by the House.The House is set to begin taking up the bill on Monday. The House Rules Committee is scheduled to meet on Monday, the first step in that process.Read more CNBC politics coverageMore Jeffrey Epstein files being released by DOJ, Blanche saysLuigi Mangione won't face death penalty in CEO murder case, federal judge rulesSenate to vote on funding deal soon as shutdown looms, GOP Sens. predictFeds arrested Don Lemon, former CNN anchor, over Minnesota activities: LawyerSen.

House Democrats are demanding assurances that changes to DHS's immigration operations will be finalized before voting on the spending package. \"Well, we're going to have that conversation later on today and as we return to Washington. But the one thing that we've said publicly is that we need a robust path toward dramatic reform,\" Jeffries, D-N.Y., said on ABC's \"This Week\" when asked how he and Democrats will vote. \"The administration can't just talk the talk. They need to walk the walk. That should begin today. Not in two weeks, today,\" he said.Sources familiar with the matter told MS NOW over the weekend that Jeffries spoke with Johnson and said Democrats will not provide the votes to fast-track the spending package, potentially jeopardizing the end of the shutdown this week.Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., said on \"Meet the Press\" Sunday that he will vote against the package when it comes to the floor. \"I'm not just a no, I'm a firm no, and I'm going to advocate with colleagues that they vote no,\" Khanna said. \"I just in good conscience cannot vote to give more money to ICE agents as they're violating our constitutional rights.\"Democratic resistance to the package makes Johnson's job of pushing the package through significantly harder. He has a razor-thin 218-213 majority in the House, set to dwindle further after Democrat Christian Menefee won a special election in Texas. \"I have a one-vote margin, yes, for the rest of 2026,\" Johnson said. \"But we're going to demonstrate once again that this is the party that takes governing seriously.\"In addition to the stopgap for DHS, the package includes bills to fully fund the departments of Defense, Treasury, State, Health and Human Services, Labor, Housing and Urban Development, Transportation, and Education through the remainder of the fiscal year.This story is developing.

    "body": "Latin America's media landscape is being reshaped by a new suite of entertainment producers, as short drama platforms, often with business ties to China, command an increasingly large share of the region's video streaming market.According to market intelligence firm Sensor Tower's State of Mobile 2026 report published last week, demand for short dramas is driving a \"structural shift in consumer attention\", with such content thriving in Latin America.Globally, the number of downloads of short-drama platforms surged by 186% year-on-year, to 733 million in the fourth quarter of 2025, surpassing those of video-streaming platforms like Netflix and Disney+, at 658 million, according to the report.Short dramas, also known as \"micro\", or \"mini\" dramas, refer to vertically-shot serials featuring episodes typically no longer than three minutes long.\"The appeal of short dramas lies in their ability to deliver emotional intensity and stimulation, which is also what allowed the format to rise so rapidly in popularity\", says Wenjia Tang, research associate from the University of Sydney's Media and Communications department.First popularized in China on short-form content-sharing apps like Douyin, a sister app of TikTok, and Kuaishou, short dramas have found international appeal, with popular platforms such as ReelShort and DramaBox now producing content dubbed in English, Spanish and French, among others.Although short dramas are increasingly expected to meet higher standards of production quality and professionalism, their original narrative style has largely been retained - delivering low-effort, low-commitment entertainment that requires neither deep thought nor extended attention, Tang told CNBC.Such content is often \"easier to digest\" for consumers accustomed to watching short-form content like TikTok videos and Instagram reels, as opposed to longer-form content from streaming platforms like Netflix, according to Seema Shah, Vice President of Insights at Sensor Tower.Sensor Tower reports that although there is a significant global uptick in consumption of short-drama content, Latin America is \"emerging as the fastest-growing region for engagement\" with these videos.Latin American downloads of the top 20 short drama apps have increased by roughly 402% year-on-year in 2025, on top of a 4,300% year-on-year increase from 2024, according to Shah.Not only do Latin American users overwhelmingly consume entertainment content on their mobile phones, there are also strong similarities between short dramas and telenovelas - a genre of serialized drama popular in Latin American countries, according to Maria Rua Aguete, Head of Media and Entertainment at research firm Omdia.Dramatic growthShort drama platforms DramaBox and ReelShort consistently ranked as two of the region's most downloaded video entertainment apps, with ReelShort's 77 million downloads in 2025 slightly edging out Dramabox's 74 million downloads, according to figures provided by Shah.While officially based abroad, both platforms have business ties to China.ReelShort is owned by Crazy Maple Studio, a content creation and distribution enterprise founded in 2017 in San Francisco. Despite having offices in Silicon Valley and Los Angeles, Crazy Maple Studio remains a subsidiary of the COL Digital Publishing Group - a Chinese media conglomerate.Micro drama custom thumb for digital video.ReelShort | GoodShort | DramaBox | Getty ImagesSimilarly, while officially headed by the Singapore-based Storymatrix Pte. Ltd, DramaBox's content remains the intellectual property of China's DianZhong Technology, according to a copyright infringement claim that it filed against Crazy Maple Studio in 2025.ReelShort and DramaBox are part of a suite of entertainment firms competing for a stake in Latin America's growing video streaming market.Omdia estimates that the total revenue generated by the Latin American market grew by 9.1% between 2024 to 2025 - more than triple the revenue growth in the U.S. over the same period. That growth is projected to accelerate to 10.7% in 2026.Latin America's expanding middle class is driving the growth in demand for short-video streaming, along with retail and ride-sharing services, according to Shah.Short-drama platforms aren't the only beneficiaries of the growing Latin American market. The region is also an important source of revenue growth for streaming giants like Netflix, which saw the fastest revenue growth on an FX-neutral basis from Latin America, according to its Q4 2025 earnings report.While the download figures of short-drama platforms have begun surpassing those of longer-form providers, experts do not see these new short video streaming platforms as credible threats to market leaders like Netflix.\"Not now, and it is not their targets either. They are aiming for different audiences, and their profit manners are different,\" Tang told CNBC.While short-drama platforms have lower production costs and can produce content at a much higher rate than more traditional studios, their business models are generally contingent on advertising revenue and pay-per-view income, which does not necessarily translate into higher margins, according to Omdia's Rua Aguete.Omdia estimates that the total revenue for all short-drama streaming platforms generated from outside China will amount to $3 billion in 2026. In comparison, Netflix reported $12 billion in revenue in Q4 2025.Nonetheless, as demand for short-drama content grows in Latin America and beyond, it is likely that these platforms will produce an increasingly diversified video-streaming market.\"I don't believe short-drama apps are a complete replacement for streaming. They are, however, additional competition for consumers' attention and dollars,\" says Sensor Tower's Shah.",

    "body": "Movie posters for the documentary \"Melania\" featuring U.S. first lady Melania Trump are displayed in a New York City subway station, in New York, U.S., Jan. 14, 2026. Jeenah Moon | ReutersAmazon's \"Melania\" earned $7 million at the domestic box office during its debut this weekend, the highest opening for a non-music documentary in more than a decade.Documentaries are not typically major ticket sales drivers, with the majority of releases over the last 10 years opening under $5 million and grossing $10 million to $20 million worldwide, according to data from Comscore. Documentaries and concert films by popular musical artists often outperform these numbers because of their built-in fan bases.Notably, Michael Moore's \"Fahrenheit 9/11\" retains the record for the highest-opening political documentary with $23.9 million. The film, which opened in 2004, also holds the record for the highest domestic haul for a political documentary with $119 million.\"We're very encouraged by the strong start and positive audience response, with early box office for 'Melania' exceeding our expectations,\" said Kevin Wilson, head of domestic theatrical distribution at Amazon MGM Studios. \"This momentum is an important first step in what we see as a long-tail lifecycle for both the film and the forthcoming docu-series, extending well beyond the theatrical window and into what we believe will be a significant run for both on our service.\"The Melania Trump documentary was acquired by the tech giant, which operates the streaming service Prime Video, for an estimated $40 million, and reports suggest the company spent nearly the same price tag on marketing for the film.Ticket sales were driven by women and moviegoers over 55, with both demographics accounting for 70% or more of receipts. Additionally, rural theaters represented 46% of total box office grosses, according to EntTelligence data. Typically, these theaters, which operate in areas with populations of fewer than 500,000 people, account for around 30% of movie ticket sales.EntTelligence estimates that 600,000 moviegoers saw the film over the weekend.While review sites have been flooded with strong audience reviews — Rotten Tomatoes' \"Popcornmeter\" stands at 99% from more than 500 users — critical responses were more scathing. \"Melania\" holds an 11% rating on Rotten Tomatoes from 19 reviews, with many critics calling the documentary \"propaganda.\"Disclosure: Versant Media is the parent company of Rotten Tomatoes and CNBC.",

Trump | Via Truth SocialA government official and top royal from the United Arab Emirates purchased a $500 million stake in the Trump family's cryptocurrency venture last year, months before the Trump administration greenlit the sale of advanced AI chips to the UAE, The Wall Street Journal reported on Saturday. Sheikh Tahnoon bin Zayed Al Nahyan — also known as the \"spy sheikh\" — is the Gulf nation's national security adviser and manager of its largest wealth fund. Aryam Investment, a Tahnoon-backed company, took a 49% stake in World Liberty Financial, according to the Journal. The deal would make Aryam the largest shareholder of World Liberty, and the company's only known investor besides the founders, the Journal reported.World Liberty is behind the stablecoin USD1, which is pegged to the U.S. dollar and backed by short-term U.S. government treasuries, U.S. dollar deposits, and other cash equivalents.The company counts President Donald Trump and his special envoy Steve Witkoff as co-founders emeritus, and is run by members of the Trump and Witkoff families. The deal, according to the Journal, was signed by Eric Trump in the days before his father's second inauguration as president. It came as Tahnoon was seeking access to advanced artificial intelligence chips from the U.S., which the Biden administration had blocked over concerns that the chips would end up in China. According to the Journal, the agreement saw roughly $187 million flow to Trump family entities and $31 million to Witkoff family entities.Read more CNBC politics coverageMore Jeffrey Epstein files being released by DOJ, Blanche saysLuigi Mangione won't face death penalty in CEO murder case, federal judge rulesSenate to vote on funding deal soon as shutdown looms, GOP Sens. predictFeds arrested Don Lemon, former CNN anchor, over Minnesota activities: LawyerSen.

The agreement called for a fifth of the chips to go to Tahnoon's own AI company, G42.The Journal report has prompted new scrutiny of the Trump administration's dealings with the UAE and Tahnoon, with some in Congress warning of potential conflicts of interest or corruption. \"This is corruption, plain and simple,\" said Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., the top Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee. \"The Trump Administration must reverse its decision to sell sensitive AI chips to the United Arab Emirates.\"Warren called on Witkoff, White House AI and crypto czar David Sacks and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick to \"testify in front of Congress on mounting evidence that they sold out American national security in order to benefit the President's crypto company — and about whether any officials lined their own pockets in the process.\"White House spokesperson Anna Kelly told the Journal that \"[t]here are no conflicts of interest.\" She added that Witkoff is working to \"advance President Trump's goals of peace around the world.\"The White House didn't immediately respond to a CNBC request for comment.Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche also defended the president on ABC's \"This Week\" on Sunday.\"I love it when these papers talk about something being unprecedented or never happening before as if the Biden family and the Biden administration didn't do exactly the same thing, and they were just in office,\" Blanche said, without providing evidence. Republicans and Trump have long accused the Biden family of corruption over the former President Joe Biden's family's business dealings abroad. Though an impeachment inquiry was launched in the House over the matter, evidence of wrongdoing by Biden never materialized. \"I don't have a comment on it beyond President Trump has been completely transparent when his family travels for business reasons,\" Blanche said. \"This idea that there's something untoward or unprecedented is just a repeated story that isn't true.\"Read the complete Wall Street Journal story here.",

    "body": "Kraft Heinz announced plans to split into two separately traded companies, reversing its 2015 megamerger, which was orchestrated by billionaire investor Warren Buffett. Justin Sullivan | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesBig Food is slimming down. As both consumers and regulators push back against ultra-processed foods, the companies that make them have been splitting up or divesting iconic brands. Last year, Unilever spun off its ice cream business into The Magnum Ice Cream Company. Kraft Heinz is preparing to break up later this year, undoing much of the merger forged more than a decade ago by Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway and private equity firm 3G Capital. And Keurig Dr Pepper is planning a similar split after it finishes its acquisition of JDE Peet's. In 2024, nearly half of mergers and acquisitions activity in the consumer products industry came from divestitures, according to consulting firm Bain. Over the next three years, 42% of M&A executives in the consumer products industry are preparing an asset for sale, a Bain survey found.Of course, the trend isn't confined to just the consumer packaged goods industry. Industrial companies like GE and Honeywell have pursued their own breakups in recent years. It's happening too in legacy media; Comcast spun off many of its cable assets into CNBC owner Versant, while Warner Bros. Discovery is planning to spin off its cable networks later this year as Netflix acquires its streaming and studios division.\"In many of the spaces that we're seeing this type of activity, there are many very fierce competitive pressures that are making it harder to operate,\" said Emilie Feldman, a professor at The Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania.The squeeze on packaged food and beverage companies comes from lower demand, which has led to shrinking volume for many of their products. To turn around their businesses and win back investors, they are counting on dumping underperforming brands. February will bring both quarterly earnings reports and presentations at the annual CAGNY Conference, offering investors more opportunities to hear about food executives' plans for their portfolios. Companies to watch include Kraft Heinz, which could share more details on its upcoming split, and Nestle, which is considering selling off multiple brands in its portfolio.Cases of Dr. Pepper are displayed at a Costco Wholesale store on April 27, 2025 in San Diego, California.Kevin Carter | Getty ImagesShrinking salesFor more than a decade, consumers have been buying fewer groceries from the inner aisles of the grocery store, instead focusing on the outer aisles with fresh produce and protein. The pandemic served as the exception, as many consumers returned to the brands that they knew. However, price hikes and \"shrinkflation\" as life eased back to normal largely erased that shift in behavior.More recently, regulators, emboldened by the \"Make America Healthy Again\" agenda espoused by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., have put both more pressure and a bigger spotlight on processed foods. And the rise of GLP-1 drugs to combat diabetes and obesity have meant some of food companies' key consumers have lost their appetite for the sweet and salty snacks that they used to eat.As a percentage of overall spending, the consumer packaged goods industry has held onto its market share. But the biggest companies are losing customers to upstart brands or private-label products, according to Bain partner Peter Horsley.On average, about 35% of large consumer products companies' portfolios are in categories with more than 7% growth, Horsley said. For comparison, over half of private-label brands are in high-growth categories, like yogurt and functional beverages, and for insurgent brands, it's even higher. For Big Food, the result has been slowing — or even declining — sales, followed by stock declines. In some cases, activist investors push for companies to focus more on their core offerings and to offload so-called distractions. \"You're seeing a lot of pressure from a valuation standpoint, especially for these publicly traded companies,\" said Raj Konanahalli, partner and managing director of AlixPartners. \"One way to reset expectations is to really kind of focus more on the core offerings and dispose or divest the slower, capital-intensive or non-core businesses.\"While getting bigger helped food companies develop scale, enter new markets and grow their sales, it also made their businesses much more complex, according to Konanahalli. Become too big, and it becomes too difficult to make decisions quickly or to decide how and where to invest back into the business.To be sure, some of these divestitures and breakups follow deals that seem to have been ill-advised from the start. Look no further than the merger of Keurig Green Mountain and Dr Pepper Snapple Group in 2018, to form Keurig Dr Pepper. \"Frankly the surprise to us was the decision back in 2018 when Keurig Green Mountain acquired the Dr Pepper Snapple Group in an $18.7 billion deal to create Keurig Dr Pepper in the first place,\" Barclays analysts Patrick Folan and Lauren Lieberman wrote in a note to clients in August when the breakup was announced. \"At the time, it was seen as both odd and a very left field deal with the questionable logic of combining coffee and [carbonated soft drinks].\"(When the merger was announced in 2018, Lieberman said on a conference call with executives from both companies that she was still \"scratching my head\" about the logic of the deal for both players).Shares of Keurig Dr Pepper have risen 37% since the merger. The S&P 500 has climbed 150% over the same period.To sell or not to sellLike many industries, the packaged food industry has gone through cycles of expansion and contraction, according to Feldman. For example, Kraft spun off a snacking business that includes Oreos into Mondelez in 2012, just three years before it merged with Heinz.However, in recent years, expanding through acquisitions has required more sophisticated thinking and execution.\"If you go back to those glory years of pre-2015, the rules of the game in consumer products felt fairly simple, at least if you're a global company,\" Bain's Horsley said. \"You bought another company that was relatively similar to you. You integrated it together, you pulled out the cost synergies ... and then that gave you good top-line and bottom-line growth. But the rules of the game have changed.\"Around 2015, upstarts like Chobani or BodyArmor began stealing market share from legacy brands. As a result, food giants needed to become more thoughtful about what they were acquiring and how they were managing their portfolios, according to Horsley. For a cautionary tale, look no further than Kraft Heinz, formed by a mega-merger in 2015. Investors initially cheered the deal, but their enthusiasm waned as the combined company's U.S. sales began lagging. Then came write-downs of many of its iconic brands, like Kraft, Oscar Mayer, Maxwell House and Velveeta, in addition to a subpoena from the Securities and Exchange Commission related to its accounting policies and internal controls.With the benefit of hindsight, analysts and investors have blamed much of Kraft Heinz's downward spiral on the brutal cost-cutting strategy imposed after the merger. The company's leadership was too focused on slashing costs and not enough on investing back into its brands, particularly at a time when consumer tastes were changing.Since Kraft Heinz began trading as one company, shares have tumbled 73%. But not everyone is sold that getting rid of underperforming brands will benefit shareholders.\"If you don't fix the underlying capability, it doesn't matter how many brands you sell or don't sell,\" RBC Capital Markets analyst Nik Modi said. \"They're not addressing the root problem. It's just something to make investors happy because it seems like they're making a change.\"One breakup that Modi agrees with is that of Kellogg, which split into the snacks-focused Kellanova and cereal-centric WK Kellogg in 2023. Last year, chocolatier Ferrero snapped up WK Kellogg for $3.1 billion, while Mars closed its $36 billion acquisition of Kellanova.From Modi's perspective, the breakup created more value for shareholders than the combined business did. Kellogg's high-growth snack business was much more viable as an acquisition target without the sluggish cereal division attached. Plus, the two strategic buyers are both privately held companies that don't have to worry about sharing quarterly earnings with the public.Some investors are hoping for the same outcome with Kraft Heinz.\"The view that many have had is the best way to create value is split the companies and hope that you can create a Kellanova 2.0 where both entities get acquired at some point down the line, and that's where value creation happens,\" said Peter Galbo, analyst at Bank of America Securities.Kraft Heinz hired Steve Cahillane, the former CEO of Kellogg and then Kellanova, as its chief executive. Once the company separates, Cahillane will serve as chief executive of Global Taste Elevation, the placeholder name for the spinoff with high-growth brands like Heinz and Philadelphia.Steve Cahillane, President and CEO, Kellogg Company accepts Salute To Greatness Corporate Award during 2020 Salute to Greatness Awards Gala at Hyatt Regency Atlanta on January 18, 2020 in Atlanta, Georgia.Paras Griffin | Getty Images Entertainment | Getty ImagesBut acquiring either company resulting from the Kraft Heinz split would be a pretty big acquisition, making it less likely that either is snapped up, according to Galbo. And the resulting uncertainty about the value creation from the breakup is maybe why Berkshire Hathaway, the company's largest shareholder, is preparing to exit its 27.5% stake in Kraft Heinz.Food divestitures pick upA month into the new year, it's unlikely that the divestiture trend will slow down. On Tuesday, General Mills announced that it is selling its Muir Glen brand of organic tomatoes to focus on its core brands. And last week, Bloomberg reported that Nestle is preparing the sale of its water unit; the Swiss giant is also reportedly considering offloading upscale coffee brand Blue Bottle and its underperforming vitamin brands.And if Big Food is making any acquisitions, the deals are more likely to involve \"insurgent brands,\" according to Bain. Over the last five years, acquisitions with a value of less than $2 billion represented 38% of total consumer products deals, up from 16% in the period from 2014 to 2019, the firm said. For example, last year, PepsiCo bought prebiotic soda brand Poppi for $1.95 billion and Hershey snapped up LesserEvil popcorn for $750 million. Bigger deals are harder to come by because of the current regulatory environment, Konanahalli said. Buyers might not be strategic players, but instead private equity firms with plenty of cash on hand. For example, in January, L Catterton bought a majority stake in cottage cheese upstart Good Culture.But a flashy divestiture or acquisition might not be the solution to a food conglomerate's woes — or a surefire way to lift the stock price. Sometimes, good old-fashioned elbow grease can work even better.\"Just because it seems like the wind is blowing your way, it doesn't mean that you can't put in some hard work and turn things around,\" AlixPartners' Konanahalli said.",

    "body": "Pharma giant AstraZeneca will list on the New York Stock Exchange on Monday, days after it announced big commitments on the other side of the world.Like the rest of Big Pharma, the company has a balancing act. It wants a close relationship with the U.S., its biggest market, and the listing is intended to boost investment there.Meanwhile, innovation-friendly China is attracting pharma companies that urgently need to develop new medicines to replace blockbuster drugs whose patents are set to expire in the next few years. Pricing challenges in the U.S. add to the pressure.AstraZeneca has announced it's investing billions in China and partnering with a Chinese biotech on weight-loss drugs, just before its shares list in the U.S on Monday.The developments come at a critical time for the pharma industry as companies are increasingly looking east for innovation to replace the revenue of current blockbuster medicines going off patent in the next couple of years. Pricing challenges in the U.S. market, which accounts for the bulk of profits for most big pharma companies, are adding to the pressure on Big Pharma.China's President Xi Jinping (R) and Britain's Prime Minister Keir Starmer shake hands before their meeting at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing on January 29, 2026.Carl Court | Afp | Getty ImagesOn Thursday, AstraZeneca said it plans to invest $15 billion in China through 2030 to expand both manufacturing and research and development, as Keir Starmer became the first UK prime minister to visit the country for eight years.\"These investments span the value chain, from drug discovery and clinical development to manufacturing, and bring Chinese innovation to the world,\" the company said, while highlighting a flurry of other partnerships with other biotechs in the region.In a separate announcement on Friday, the UK's largest company would partner up with Hong Kong-listed CSPC Pharmaceuticals to strengthen its obesity portfolio. The collaboration agreement includes eight of CSPC's preclinical and early-stage programs, including a once-monthly injectable. CSP stock fell 10.2% on the announcement. AstraZeneca will pay CSPC $1.2 billion upfront, and an additional $17.3 billion if certain regulatory, research and sales milestones are met, an AstraZeneca spokesperson confirmed to CNBC on Friday. The company declined to comment further on its geographic priorities. watch nowThe announcements came just before the listing of AstraZeneca shares on the New York Stock Exchange on Monday, as well as its recently announced $50 billion U.S. investment to waive off U.S. pharma tariffs.\"What we can discern from this is that the US and China will be the two most important regions for the company for the foreseeable future,\" Camilla Oxhamre, portfolio manager at Rhenman & Partners, told CNBC via email.AstraZeneca's balancing actThe U.S. is AstraZeneca's by far largest market, and the company said last year it would end its American depositary shares program to pursue a listing on the New York Stock Exchange, keeping its listings also in London and Stockholm, saying it wanted a more global investor base.\"It's the largest pharma company [in China] and when they decide to list in the U.S., there would always be a question about the commitment in the minds of some to China, and the fact that they had a few investigations last year,\" HSBC's Rajesh Kumar, head of European life sciences and healthcare equity research, told CNBC. In 2025, Astrazeneca faced several probes by Chinese regulators into unpaid import duties.\"So they are, in effect, telling you very clearly that they are committed to China by this action,\" Kumar added.China is also AstraZeneca's second-largest market. Oxhamre, whose fund has a large long position in Astra, added that the Chinese market would \"continue to grow in importance over time, both in terms of revenue and research.\"And Astra isn't the only pharma company looking to China for new, innovative assets. London-listed GSK inked a deal with Hengrui Pharma worth up to $12 billion in July, most of it tied to achieving certain development and commercial milestones.China's hot biotech sceneLicensing deals between Big Pharma and Chinese biotechs, like the one between AstraZeneca and CSPC, have increased sharply in recent years, with 57 such deals in 2025, according to Biopharma Dive data. \"These deals demonstrate the success of China's long-running effort to move up the biopharma value chain, from fast followers to differentiated assets that can compete globally,\" said PitchBook analysts in a report published last month.Read moreChina's emergence as a leader in preclinical and early-stage development comes as biotech funding elsewhere has suffered in recent years, and is helped by the speed at which early human trials can be conducted there. A reverse brain drain, where Chinese scientists are returning to the country, is also helping the country's biotech sector, according to Kumar.\"China's biopharma sector has reshaped itself around next-generation therapeutics paired with efficient clinical-trial infrastructure to de-risk these assets,\" the PitchBook analysts said.\"Multinational and mid-cap biopharma companies are sourcing assets from China at growing rates, spanning both headline megadeals and smaller licensing deals. Importantly, this activity is skewing toward complex biologics rather than legacy modalities.\"A Harvard Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs report from June suggested \"China has the most immediate opportunity to overtake the United States in biotechnology\" and that this could \"quickly shift the global balance of power.\"But late 2025 saw a meaningful pickup in U.S. biotech funding.\"There will always be innovation coming from both geographies,\" Kumar said. \"The world has changed… China was catching up with the U.S., [the] U.S. will re-accelerate.\"— CNBC's Evelyn Cheng contributed to this report",

    "body": "You need to have the right skills to do the job you're hoping to land. But your ability to communicate that you have them — and can use them to help your prospective employer become more successful — is just as important.\"The things that make us good at communication also make us very, very attractive in an interview,\" Charles Duhigg tells CNBC Make It. Duhigg has studied hundreds of people in authoring three books on productivity, habits and communication. His latest book, \"Supercommunicators: How to Unlock the Secret Language of Connection,\" examines what sets the most effective communicators apart.Duhigg shared three communication tips that candidates should take into their next job interviews to connect with the person on the other side of the table (or screen) and make a stronger impression.1. Give authentic answersInterviewers know candidates are eager to impress. But if your answers to interview questions sound too polished or canned, you could be doing yourself a disservice.\"They know that you're performing; they know that you're there to try and get a job,\" Duhigg says. But the more we can \"genuinely convey who we are,\" the more the employer has \"a chance to see whether we'll actually succeed there.\"Answering questions genuinely, but tactfully, can help you stand out, he adds. \"The interviewer is going to remember that answer,\" he says. \"The best communication is the most genuine communication.\"One of the toughest questions to answer in an interview is \"Tell me about your weaknesses.\"If they ask a question like this, Duhigg says, \"and I answer it as honestly as I can, it doesn't mean that I have to expose my flaws, it doesn't mean that I have to say something out of line.\"Career coach Madeline Mann previously told CNBC Make It that an ideal answer would briefly explain a genuine weakness, but not one that's \"core to the job,\" before laying out steps you're taking to address the problem area.2. Ask questions\"Think about how many people go into an interview and the person asks them, 'Do you have any questions for me?' and the question they ask is completely predictable,\" Duhigg says.The best communicators typically \"ask a lot more questions\" than their peers, Duhigg says. They also ask what he calls deep questions, or those that center on a person's values, beliefs or experience.For job candidates, that might mean asking an interviewer how they got into that line of work, or what their favorite part of working there is.3. Mirror their body languageSome of the most important communication is silent. Body language can be very telling, and mirroring things like your interviewer's posture, gestures and expressions can make you a more attractive candidate for the job.That could be as simple as smiling back when they smile during conversation or noticing when they lean in and doing the same.\"The more we are prepared and comfortable doing that, the better off that interview is going to go,\" Duhigg says.Want to get ahead at work with AI?

    "body": "There's no way to walk through New York City's Flatiron district without seeing The Flatiron Building. It first opened in 1902 and has been part of the city's fabric ever since. And for the first time in 124 years, if you have the money, you can call it home.Formerly a commercial building, the Flatiron Building is being converted into 38 luxury condominiums, with a full completion scheduled for later this year. Apartments in the building range from three-bedroom units selling for around $10.95 million to the penthouse on the 21st floor going for over $50 million. Corcoran Sunshine is leading sales and marketing for all of the apartments, which were designed by Studio Sofield. \"Very few buildings in the world elicit an emotional response like The Flatiron Building and reimagining this iconic landmark as residential homes has been an exciting and deeply meaningful experience; one we approach with great care and respect,\" William Sofield, designer and founder of Studio Sofield, tells CNBC Make It via email. There are currently two four-bedroom, four-bathroom units available, priced from $16 million to $18.9 million. Others are set to become available later this year, with three-quarters of the building expected to be done by July. The 11th floor apartment spans 3,828 square feet and occupies two corners of the building.Courtesy of The Flatiron BuildingThe first is an 11th-floor unit that went on the market on Jan. 24 for $16 million. It spans 3,828 square feet and occupies two corners of the building, offering south, east and west exposures. The standout feature is the great room, measuring 58 feet by 21 feet, with 10-foot ceilings. \"You're in a historic building looking at historic facades. It gets tremendous light because it's southwest facing,\" James Lansill, senior managing director at Corcoran Sunshine Marketing Group, tells CNBC Make It. The second apartment is on the sixth floor and listed for $18.9 million. It spans 4,654 square feet with a great room measuring more than 63 feet by 26 feet. It also has an additional half bathroom. The unit offers views of Madison Square Park, up to Fifth Avenue and Broadway.One of the facing points of the apartment has views of Madison Square Park.Courtesy of The Flatiron BuildingLansill says the Flatiron Building apartments are special because each unit has subtle differences from its peers. \"Each one has a personality and that personality can be informed by the historical trim that surrounds the outside of the window,\" he says. \"What was modern about The Flatiron Building in 1902 is still what's modern about it today. The reimagined interiors reflect a love of craftsmanship, texture, and history. We carefully considered what kind of design would best honor the site's integrity and its place within the city,\" Sofield says. The sixth floor apartment spans 4,654 square feet with a great room measuring over 63 feet by 26 feet.Courtesy of The Flatiron BuildingThe Flatiron Building conversion began in 2023 and is a redevelopment led by the Brodsky Organization and the Sorgente Group.\"It's been a thrilling process because the building has this historical and architectural interest, but it also has this iconic shape,\" Lansill says. Landsill adds that because the building was designed for commercial use, it took the team about eight months to develop a concept that made sense. They eventually landed on two units per floor — a north and south apartment — plus two full-floor units on floors 20 and 21. Some of the amenities include a 60-foot lap pool, fitness center, billiards rooms and a piano lounge.Courtesy of The Flatiron BuildingPart of the conversation meant adding 21st-century amenities, including a wellness center, fitness center, sports simulator, lounge, 60-foot lap pool, billiards rooms and a piano lounge. The building also offers residents private storage and wine cellars for an extra fee. At the time of reporting, four apartments in the building have already sold, according to Lansill.

In keeping with the president's push for lower interest rates, Warsh is expected to be more supportive of cutting the Fed's key benchmark rate later this year, which could have far-reaching consequences for consumers. \"I have known Kevin for a long period of time, and have no doubt that he will go down as one of the GREAT Fed Chairmen, maybe the best,\" Trump said Friday in a Truth Social post. Members of the Fed's board of governors, including the chair, are nominated by the president but must be approved by the Senate. If confirmed, Warsh, a former Fed governor with a Wall Street background, will take over as chair when Powell's term ends in May.How the Fed affects consumersRead more CNBC personal finance coverageFlying without a Real ID?

Cutting the rate can spur spending and boost the economy, but also fuel higher prices. Both high interest rates and high prices can hurt consumers, so the Fed's decision whether to raise or lower its rate or hold it steady requires a delicate balance.The Fed has indicated that its goal of stabilizing prices and maximizing employment is the reason policymakers don't want to ease up too quickly now. After this week's two-day meeting of its Federal Open Market Committee, the Fed kept its benchmark interest rate unchanged.Trump's choiceWarsh has been critical of the central bank's handling of inflation in the past. He told CNBC in July that lowering the fed funds rate by a full point in 2024 when inflation was above the Fed's target, and the Fed's hesitancy to cut rates the following year, undermined its credibility.\"Based on his past statements and actions in his previous stint as a Fed Governor, Warsh was by far the most hawkish of the four final candidates for Fed Chair,\" said Brett House, an economics professor at Columbia Business School.Trump has said rates should be sharply lower, and that keeping them elevated puts the U.S. at an economic disadvantage to countries with lower rates.\"There was no person who was going to get this job who wasn't going to be cutting rates in the short term,\" David Bahnsen, chief investment officer of The Bahnsen Group, said Friday on CNBC's \"Squawk Box.\" Former Federal Reserve Governor Kevin Warsh, a fellow in economics at the Hoover Institution and lecturer at the Stanford Graduate School of Business, speaks during the Sohn Investment Conference in New York, May 8, 2017.Brendan McDermid | ReutersAn 'uncomfortable but important' lesson from historyWhile further Fed rate cuts could alleviate pressure for borrowers, experts say the Fed should not reduce interest rates too soon while inflation is still above target — a mistake the Fed has made in the past.Consumers waiting for borrowing costs to ease may be better off if the Fed sticks to its current cautious stance, according to Mark Higgins, senior vice president at Index Fund Advisors and author of \"Investing in U.S. Financial History: Understanding the Past to Forecast the Future.\"\"It's too early to judge Kevin Warsh as Fed chair,\" Higgins said. \"What is clear from history, though, is that allowing inflation to persist at elevated levels for too long makes it much harder and far more painful to extinguish later.\"In the 1970s, then-President Richard Nixon pressured Fed Chair Arthur Burns to keep interest rates low — and give the economy some gas — in the runup to the 1972 presidential election. That set the stage for runaway inflation, economists now say. Consumer prices surged in the decade that followed. The inflation rate in 1980 peaked at around 15%, which remains the highest rate since 1947, when the country was still recovering from World War II.The Fed ultimately, under new leadership, raised interest rates to punishing levels to rein in inflation, leading to surging borrowing costs in the '80s. \"The message to households is uncomfortable but important,\" Higgins said. \"Accepting shorter, more acute economic pain now is preferable to prolonged inflation that continues to erode purchasing power. History is unambiguous on this point.\"Subscribe to CNBC on YouTube.",

    "body": "watch nowIn his first stint at the Federal Reserve, Kevin Warsh came to a central bank that was about to be asked to save the world. He returns now under very different circumstances, asked to serve a notoriously fickle president who will place significant but very different demands on him.Warsh indeed is a Fed veteran, serving during the critical period of 2006 to 2011 that led up to and ultimately through the global financial crisis and the central bank's efforts to stabilize the economy. Appointed by President George W. Bush, Warsh was one of the youngest members ever to serve on the board of governors.While at the Fed, Warsh played an important role in the design and implementation of emergency lending programs aimed at stabilizing credit markets. Warsh also played a key role in helping devise the myriad programs aimed at rescuing the economy. One of those programs, developed separately at the Treasury Department, became known as the Troubled Asset Relief Program, developed by Neel Kashkari, who is now the Minneapolis Fed president.However, Warsh emerged from the era as a Fed critic. He warned that large-scale asset purchases and near-zero benchmark interest rates ran the risk of distorting markets and undermining long-term price stability. While supporting the earlier efforts, Warsh voted against the second round of Fed bond buying, a program known as quantitative easing.Read more CNBC news on Kevin WarshWho is Kevin Warsh?

Cross | Bloomberg | Getty Images'Central casting'Warsh has further criticized the post-financial crisis Fed with going too far in monetary policy stimulus, contending that it is helping sow the sees for further crises. In some respects, President Donald Trump is appointing a Fed chair who may be even less inclined to accommodate political pressure than Jerome Powell.Trump cited Warsh's extensive background in announcing his appointment to the top Fed post Friday morning. Warsh is currently a distinguished visiting fellow at Stanford University.\"On top of everything else, he is 'central casting,' and he will never let you down,\" the president posted on Truth Social.Warsh, is a Stanford University graduate who earned his law degree from Harvard and ultimately married into the Lauder cosmetics family. Before joining the Fed, he worked in investment banking at Morgan Stanley and served in the George W. Bush White House as a special assistant to the president for economic policy.While positioning himself as a defender of Fed independence, Warsh also has criticized it for mission creep and told CNBC in an interview last year that the central bank needs \"regime change.\"Warsh made his misgivings known about the current Fed. \"The credibility deficit lies with the incumbents that are at the Fed, in my view,\" he said during that July interview. It's a position that could put him in an adversarial role at an institution where consensus building is key to policy implementation.Despite multiple missteps on policymaking, Chair Powell has largely been able to keep the Fed consensus together. However, in recent months that has faltered, with each of the past several meetings featuring at least one and sometimes multiple dissents. Warsh's appointment would mark a sharp philosophical shift from Powell's pragmatic, consensus-driven approach and signal a potential tightening of the Fed's tolerance for inflation and balance sheet expansion. He would fill the seat currently occupied by Stephen Miran, whose term expires Saturday.Miran told CNBC on Friday that he supports the pick.\"Chairman-designate Warsh has a long history of being an innovative and original thinker on monetary policy,\" Miran said. \"He's got a number of really important insights over the years, and I'm really excited to see all the good work he's going to do at the Fed.\"watch nowCan Warsh sway the Fed committee?But if Trump thinks Warsh will be able to just push through aggressive rate cuts with ease, he might be in for an unpleasant surprise. Multiple voting members on the Federal Open Market Committee have expressed resistance to cutting further until there's more evidence that inflation is definitively moving towards the central bank's 2% inflation goal. Moreover, the full group of Fed officials in December indicated they see just one more rate cut coming in 2026, then another in 2027. In the aggregate, that's in line with market expectations, with futures traders pricing in two reductions this year and none next year.Traditionally, though, the chair has been first among equals when it comes to voting on the FOMC, so Warsh may be able to tilt the group in at least a bit more dovish direction.\"We see Warsh as a pragmatist not an ideological hawk in the tradition of the independent conservative central banker,\" Krishna Guha, head of global policy and central bank strategy at Evercore ISI, said in a note. \"Because he has a hawkish reputation and is seen as independent, he is better placed to bring the FOMC along with him to deliver at least two and plausibly three cuts this year than some rivals.\"So while Warsh may prove an ideological ally of the administration, how that translates into action will be a key question.\"Analytically, we expect he will be strongly aligned with the Administration's arguments that booming productivity will allow for neutral or accommodative rates even with robust growth,\" wrote Tobin Marcus, head of U.S. policy and politics at Wolfe Research. \"But it all depends how the data comes in, as we expect the rest of the FOMC will remain data-dependent and focused on the workhorse Fed models that Warsh has criticized.\"Warsh emerged from a competitive derby that one included 11 candidates, an array of past and present Fed officials, leading economists and a few Wall Street investment professionals including BlackRock fixed income chief Rick Rieder. That field was whittled down to five then four before Warsh emerged as the selection.Trump made no secret of the most important criteria — a willingness to slash rates lower and keep them low. The president has expressed the importance of lower rates as both a way to help the moribund U.S. housing market and to help lower financing costs for the $37 trillion U.S. debt. Before all that, he will have to be confirmed by a Senate during a ticklish political situation. The Trump Justice Department has been investigating the massive renovation project at the Fed's Washington, D.C., headquarters and has served Powell with a subpoena demanding information. Republican Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina has vowed to block any Trump Fed nominees until that situation is resolved.Once that hurdle is cleared, Warsh would face a full Senate in which Republicans still command a majority.\"The Warsh pick is likely to have broad support – Democrat economist Jason Furman is out early in favor – and he should be relatively easy to confirm in the Senate,\" Guha said.

    "body": "watch nowThe stock market is well-positioned to bounce next week if the heavyweight companies set to report earnings deliver strong numbers, CNBC's Jim Cramer said Friday. That's because the market ended the week on a subdued note, the \"Mad Money\" host said, after the S&P 500 finished in the red for three straight days.The busy week wastes no time getting underway, with Disney reporting on Monday and talk of CEO succession in the air. Cramer's Charitable Trust, the portfolio used by the CNBC Investing Club, threw in the towel on its Disney position in November after a prolonged period of stagnant performance. \"There was always some division that held it back. I don't know which it is this time. You never do,\" Cramer said. On Tuesday, we'll get the latest from names including Pfizer, Pepsi, Merck, Advanced Micro Devices, and Chipotle. While investors will look to AMD for insights into the AI boom, Cramer said it's possible that even a terrific set of numbers will be met with selling. That's seemingly become \"the new pattern\" for chip stocks, he said. Also Tuesday, Western Digital is hosting what it's dubbed an innovation day, where the company plans to highlight innovations aimed at supporting growing data storage demand. Cramer said the upcoming event is \"critical\" after the company's stock got crushed Friday despite posting a great quarter the prior evening. \"We have to find out what that's about,\" he said.Eli Lilly reports Wednesday morning, and Cramer said he'll be watching for whether the obesity drugmaker shares any new trial results for its GLP-1 portfolio — something that could be more meaningful to the stock's movements than the quarterly results themselves. Lilly shares are down about 3.5% year to date. Alphabet, which reports Wednesday night, will be among the most consequential reports for the market. \"This is a company that many wrote off as the least of the 'Magnificent Seven,'\" Cramer said, but the narrative has completely flipped. \"Whether it be Gemini, the best of the chatbots, or YouTube, the most popular video site in the world, or Waymo ... or Google itself, doesn't matter. Alphabet is the best and when it reports, I think it could romp.\" The other tech giant reporting next week is Amazon, which will release its numbers after the close Thursday. Cramer said Amazon has become a controversial stock. When the stock finally gets momentum, Cramer said the sellers appear, eroding the gains. \"Lost in the shuffle is the greatness of the company itself,\" Cramer said, acknowledging the stock's lackluster returns of late. \"I'm a believer.\" Rounding out the week on Friday is the January employment report, which Cramer said could come in weaker than anticipated both on job gains and wage inflation. That could help support lower bond yields while enabling stocks to soar, he said. \"I think it's a distinct possibility.\" Disclosure: Cramer's Charitable Trust has positions in LLY, AMZN and GOOGL.Sign up now for the CNBC Investing Club to follow Jim Cramer's every move in the market.watch now",

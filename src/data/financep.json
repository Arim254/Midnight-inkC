    "body": "\"My child won't tell me anything about their day!\" It's a common concern I hear from parents in my psychotherapy office. They're hoping to gain a glimpse into their child's world. But asking \"How was school today?\" usually leads to a one-word answer.As a therapist and the author of \"13 Things Mentally Strong Parents Don't Do,\" I encourage parents to ask questions that are thoughtful and spark meaningful conversations. When kids reflect on their experiences, they practice skills like emotional awareness, problem-solving, and empathy, and develop a growth mindset.Here are seven questions that lead to productive conversations while also helping kids grow mentally stronger:1. 'What was the best part of your day?'This question encourages kids to scan their brains for positives. For children who dislike school or tend to focus on what went wrong, answering this question helps them build optimism and gratitude — which are both protective factors for mental health.Frame the question with your own experience, saying, \"The best part of my day was going for a walk during my lunch break. What about you?\" Your child might share a highlight, like, \"I played kickball at recess.\"2. 'What's a mistake you learned from today?'This one normalizes errors and celebrates healthy risk-taking. Talking openly about mistakes reduces shame and helps kids see them as opportunities for growth.Ask with a tone of curiosity, not judgment: \"Did anything happen today that you'd do differently next time?\" This might prompt them to say, \"I forgot my library book so I'm going to pack it tonight so I don't forget.\"3. 'Who were you proud of today?'It works because it turns their attention to others and cultivates empathy. You will also gain insight into your child's relationships and what they value.Make the question more specific by asking, for example, \"Did you see anyone try really hard at something today?\" Your child may talk about a friend who was brave or might give themselves a pat on the back and say, \"My friend forgot her snack so I shared mine.\"4. 'What's one thing that would have made today better?'This question helps kids identify feelings like frustration and disappointment without dwelling on those experiences. It naturally opens the door to problem-solving and planning.You can ask in a fun way, such as, \"If you had a magic wand to change one thing about today, what would it be?\" This can lead to creative ideas, like, \"I wish there was more time for my art project so maybe I'll bring it home to finish it.\" 5. 'Who did you help today?'You can empower kids to engage in prosocial behavior with questions like this. When you ask regularly, kids begin to look for opportunities to be helpful and acts of kindness become second nature.  Ask about small acts of contribution: \"How were you a helper today?\" They might remember something simple, like, \"I helped the teacher pass out papers.\"6. 'What was the most interesting thing you learned today?'It emphasizes curiosity over academic performance. Showing interest in the learning process itself fuels lifelong learning.Encourage kids to talk about what they learned aside from just their subjects. They may share a fun fact, like, \"I learned that my teacher knows how to play the violin.\" Show interest and ask follow-up questions to keep the conversation going.7. 'What's something new you'd like to try?'This nudges kids to look outside their comfort zone and encourages them to be courageous. They don't have to be good at something in order to try something new — it's a learning experience. If your child hesitates to try new things, encourage an experiment by asking, \"Is there a club or activity you're curious about just trying once?\" They may be more likely to explore if they know they don't have to stick with it forever.Amy Morin is a psychotherapist, clinical social worker and instructor at Northeastern University. She is the author of several books including \"13 Things Strong Kids Do: Think Big, Feel Good, Act Brave\" and \"13 Things Mentally Strong Parents Don't Do.\" Her TEDx talk \"The Secret of Becoming Mentally Strong\" is one of the most viewed talks of all time.

    "body": "For millions of Americans, it is an uncertain time.Amazon, General Motors and Paramount have all been making layoffs, and U.S.-based employers announced 153,074 job cuts in October altogether, according to research firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas.The government shutdown has also left hundreds of thousands of workers without pay, millions of SNAP recipients without funds to feed themselves and their families, and now thousands of travelers with reduced flight options.There are ways to cope that don't exacerbate the financial anxiety you might be feeling. For example, financial therapist Aja Evans recommends leaning into self-care activities that cost little to no money, like going outside and spending time with family and friends.But there's a mindset shift people can make as well.Instead of experiencing uncertainty as an anomaly, remember that \"uncertainty is fundamental reality,\" says best-selling author and wellness guru Deepak Chopra. \"Every moment we breathe, live and move in uncertainty, pretending that it's certainty.\"Start with the presumption that life is uncertain.Deepak ChopraWellness guru, authorThe 79-year-old recently launched a wellness platform offering various meditations, live digital sessions with him and a Deepak Chopra AI chatbot drawing from his decades of writing and talks that users can interact with directly.Instead of thinking of uncertainty as an inhibitor in your life, think of it as a chance to try something new. \"In every uncertain event,\" says Chopra, \"there is the seed for a greater opportunity and creativity.\"That creativity can lead to fresh problem solving in whatever difficult circumstance you're facing and solutions you haven't considered before.Creativity is \"a new story, a new paradigm, a new way of dealing with relationships, new context and new meaning,\" he says.When you feel that anxiety creeping in about an unclear future, \"start with the presumption that life is uncertain,\" says Chopra. \"When you start with that, you welcome the unknown.\"Want to level up your AI skills? Sign up for Smarter by CNBC Make It's new online course, How To Use AI To Communicate Better At Work.

    "body": "Jamie Dimon, chief executive officer of JPMorgan Chase & Co., speaks during the 2025 National Retirement Summit in Washington, DC, US, on Wednesday, March 12, 2025.Al Drago | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesJPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon recently opened up about his phone habits at work, including never reading text messages and having his phone notifications turned off.\"I don't have notifications,\" the finance boss told CNN's Erin Burnett in an interview. \"If you sent me a text during the day, I probably do not read it.\"He added: \"The only notifications I get is from my kids. That's it. When they text me, I get that.\"The 69-year-old revealed that he doesn't carry his phone around with him all the time and prioritizes deep focus at work.\"When I'm walking around the building and going to meetings, I don't have it on me. It's in my office,\" he said. \"When I go to my meetings, I did the pre-reads and I'm 100% focused on us, what you're talking about, why you're talking about it, as opposed to I'm distracted and I'm thinking about other things.\"Dimon has previously aired his gripes about poor meeting etiquette and said at Fortune's Most Powerful Women Summit in October that using phones in meetings is \"disrespectful\" and \"wastes time.\"\"If you have an iPad in front of me and it looks like you're reading your email or getting notifications, I'll tell you to close the damn thing,\" he said at the time.He explained that meetings should have a purpose and that checking emails and getting distracted are red flags.Working from homeDimon has remained critical of some of the newest shifts in the workplake brought about by the youngest generation at work: Gen Z. Dimon has adhered to more traditional ways of working, often expecting his employees to do the same.Earlier this year, JPMorgan Chase's CEO went on a rant in a leaked audio recording, to JPMorgan employees about working from home and phone usage in meetings after workers complained about having to return to the office five days a week.Dimon told them to quit saying he was concerned about the \"damage\" that work from home was doing to younger recruits.\"Don't give me this s--- that work-from-home Friday works ... I call a lot of people on Fridays, and there's not a goddamn person you can get a hold of ... I've had it with this kind of stuff,\" he said in the recording.\"They're here, they're there, the Zooms [Gen Z], and the zoomers don't show up ... That's not how you run a great company.\"He even took a shot at managers in the call saying they were abusing the privilege of working from home to slack off. When on Zoom, managers were looking at their mail, sending texts and not paying attention, Dimon said. \"And if you don't think that slows down efficiency, creativity, creates rudeness – it does,\" he added.Work etiquetteAnastasia Dedyukhina, a digital wellbeing expert, previously told CNBC Make It that frequently checking your smartphone reduces the quality of your conversations with friends and colleagues. A 2023 survey by Reviews.org found that Americans check their phones an average of 144 times a day.She explained that even just a having a phone near you can be extremely distracting. Using a phone could also leave a bad impression on managers and colleagues and is bad working etiquette.\"I would also keep thinking about it because for our minds, a smartphone and the sound of a smartphone is a highly attractive stimuli. So when I hear my phone ringing and make a notification, for my mind, it's the same as if you were calling me by my name,\" Dedyukhina said.That's why Harvard University associate professor Alison Wood Brooks formerly shared with CNBC Make It that it's important to focus in meetings as it makes you appear smarter and more likable. This includes asking follow up questions and paraphrasing and repeating what the other person said back to them.",

Vcg | Visual China Group | Getty ImagesDeflation pressures in China eased in October as consumer prices returned to growth after remaining in negative territory for the most part this year, supported by holiday season demand, while declines in wholesale prices also moderated.Data from China's National Bureau of Statistics released Sunday showed consumer price index reading for October at 0.2%, compared with analysts' expectations of zero, or flat growth year on year. October's reading was the strongest since January this year, and the first positive growth in consumer prices since June.On a month-on-month basis CPI also rose by 0.2%, compared with Reuters-polled analysts' expectations of zero growth.Food prices, which have been a drag on the country's CPI, dropped 2.9% year on year. However, prices rose 0.2% over the previous month.Factory-gate deflation eased with prices falling 2.1%, year on year, compared with Reuters' poll estimates for a 2.2% decline, completing three years in negative territory. Month-on-month producer prices rose by 0.1% in October.\"In October, policies aimed at expanding domestic demand continued to take effect, coupled with the boost from the National Day and Mid-Autumn Festival holidays,\" Dong Lijuan, chief statistician at the urban division of the National Bureau of Statistics, said in a statement.Read moreWhile China's steps aimed at reining in price wars and fueling demand seem to have started bearing fruit, with the country's industrial profits in September rising more than 21%, experts warn that Chinese local governments' dependence on tax revenue encourages sustained production, intensifying competition and overcapacity until there are meaningful tax changes.China's manufacturing activity in October declined more than expected, contracting to its lowest level in six months, according to an official survey released Oct. 30. The sub-indexes for production, new orders, raw material inventory and employment all deepened their contraction, pointing to a sharp manufacturing slowdown.Chinese producers have been in the throes of demand uncertainty owed to trade tensions with the U.S. this year and weak consumer confidence at home as Beijing struggles with a prolonged housing downturn and headwinds to exports.The country's exports in October unexpectedly contracted, with shipments to the U.S. clocking double-digit declines for a seventh consecutive month, down 25%, customs data released Thursday showed.Going forward, export headwinds could weaken as U.S. President Donald Trump and his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, agreed to a trade truce during their meeting in South Korea on Oct. 30, defusing a potentially incendiary situation that had stoked worries of a full-blown trade war.China's leadership last month vowed to boost domestic consumption as it laid out the economic roadmap for the next five years. China must \"vigorously boost consumption,\" the meeting readout said, according to a CNBC translation.The leaders elaborated on the need for lifting consumption with calls to balance it with \"effective investment\" and \"adhere to the strategic point of expanding domestic demand.\"—  CNBC's Anniek Bao and Evelyn Cheng contributed to this report.",

Jonathan Ernst | ReutersPresident Donald Trump proposed a compromise on health insurance payments, calling on Republicans to send federal payments that would go to insurers under the Affordable Care Act directly to Americans to bring an end to the government shutdown.\"I am recommending to Senate Republicans that the Hundreds of Billions of Dollars currently being sent to money sucking Insurance Companies in order to save the bad Healthcare provided by ObamaCare, BE SENT DIRECTLY TO THE PEOPLE SO THAT THEY CAN PURCHASE THEIR OWN, MUCH BETTER, HEALTHCARE, and have money left over,\" he wrote in a Truth Social post on Saturday, without providing any details.The post comes one day after Senate Republicans rejected Democratic Minority Leader Chuck Schumer's deal that would have allowed the U.S. government to reopen after a shutdown that began Oct. 1. The shutdown is now the longest in U.S. history.The plan Democrats put forward on Friday proposed protecting federal ACA subsidies for at least one year, in exchange for dropping their demand that a longer-term extension of Obamacare tax credits be included in a stopgap government funding bill.Those subsidies, which more than 20 million Americans use, will expire at the end of December if Congress does not extend them.Read more CNBC government shutdown coverageDuffy warns air travel will be ‘reduced to a trickle’ as the shutdown drags onTrump tells Republicans to send health insurance money 'directly to the people'Food banks in ‘disaster response mode’ due to shutdown, SNAP cuts, leaders saySenate Republicans reject Democrat deal to reopen governmentDemocratic leader offers deal to reopen government but Republicans sneerTrump admin asks Supreme Court to block order it pay full SNAP benefitsSNAP benefits must be fully paid by Trump administration by Friday, judge ordersDC sandwich thrower Sean Dunn found not guilty of assaulting federal agentJudge dismisses criminal case against Boeing over Max crashes despite skepticismNancy Pelosi announces retirement from CongressTrump bashes Mamdani after Democrats sweep key electionsSupreme Court justices appear skeptical that Trump tariffs are legalCalifornia voters approve new U.S. House map to boost Democrats in 2026Democrats win big on election night in key racesSenate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., on Friday called the Democrats' proposal a \"non-starter.\"The White House did not immediately respond to a CNBC request for comment or specifics on how Trump's proposed direct payment plan would work.Representatives for Sens. Schumer and Thune did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The D.C. offices for House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., and House Minority Leader Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Congressional lawmakers have been in a stalemate, unable to find a compromise to end the shutdown. Democrats want a funding bill to include health-care subsidies that are due to expire for 24 million Americans at year's end. Republicans, meanwhile, say Congress must first pass a funding bill without strings attached and allow the government to reopen before tackling other issues.In multiple posts on Saturday, Trump also reiterated his calls for terminating the filibuster, the Senate rule requiring 60 of its 100 members to pass most legislation. The GOP holds 53 seats in the Senate. There are 45 Democratic senators, and two independents who caucus with them.Senate Republicans have pushed back on changing the rule, saying earlier this week they would not support a change. Trump had called for his party to exercise what he called \"the Nuclear Option\" on the rule.On Saturday, Trump alleged that he is \"making progress\" with Republicans on changing the rule.\"The Democrats are cracking like dogs on the Shutdown because they are deathly afraid that I am making progress with the Republicans on TERMINATING THE FILIBUSTER! Whether we make a Deal or not, THE REPUBLICANS MUST 'BLOW UP' THE FILIBUSTER,\" he wrote.",

Mel Musto | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesThe U.S. Department of Agriculture, in a memo late Saturday evening, threatened to enact financial penalties on states that issued full monthly SNAP benefits for November if they don't \"undo\" those food stamp payments.The late-night directive from the Trump administration adds to the chaos surrounding the anti-hunger program that serves more than 42 million Americans.The memo, signed by Patrick Penn, Deputy Under Secretary of the USDA's Food, Nutrition, and Consumer Services, warned states that the administration had not cleared full SNAP benefit payments for November.\"To the extent States sent full SNAP payment files for November 2025, this was unauthorized,\" the memo said.State program administrators were directed to distribute 65% partial payments of SNAP benefits for the month instead, the memo said.States must also \"immediately undo any steps taken to issue full SNAP benefits for November 2025,\" the memo said. Failure to comply could result in the USDA cancelling the federal share of administration costs or holding states financially liable for \"any overissuances that result from the noncompliance.\"It was unclear how the USDA expects states to claw back any unauthorized SNAP payments.Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., blasted the Trump administration's move.\"The cruelty is the point. It is their choice to do this,\" Klobuchar wrote in a post on the social media site X.The USDA and the White House did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment.Read more CNBC government shutdown coverageDuffy warns air travel will be ‘reduced to a trickle’ as the shutdown drags onTrump tells Republicans to send health insurance money 'directly to the people'Food banks in ‘disaster response mode’ due to shutdown, SNAP cuts, leaders saySenate Republicans reject Democrat deal to reopen governmentDemocratic leader offers deal to reopen government but Republicans sneerTrump admin asks Supreme Court to block order it pay full SNAP benefitsSNAP benefits must be fully paid by Trump administration by Friday, judge ordersDC sandwich thrower Sean Dunn found not guilty of assaulting federal agentJudge dismisses criminal case against Boeing over Max crashes despite skepticismNancy Pelosi announces retirement from CongressTrump bashes Mamdani after Democrats sweep key electionsSupreme Court justices appear skeptical that Trump tariffs are legalCalifornia voters approve new U.S. House map to boost Democrats in 2026Democrats win big on election night in key racesThe memo was first reported by The New York Times.It comes as some states scrambled to comply with a court ruling on Thursday, when a federal judge in Rhode Island ordered the Trump administration to pay full SNAP benefits for November on Friday. The judge rejected the administration's plan to partially fund the food stamp program amid the U.S. government shutdown.The USDA subsequently told states that it would begin disbursing full SNAP benefits to comply with that order, even as the ruling faced an appeal from the Trump administration.Read more CNBC government shutdown coverageDuffy warns air travel will be ‘reduced to a trickle’ as the shutdown drags onTrump tells Republicans to send health insurance money 'directly to the people'Food banks in ‘disaster response mode’ due to shutdown, SNAP cuts, leaders saySenate Republicans reject Democrat deal to reopen governmentDemocratic leader offers deal to reopen government but Republicans sneerTrump admin asks Supreme Court to block order it pay full SNAP benefitsSNAP benefits must be fully paid by Trump administration by Friday, judge ordersDC sandwich thrower Sean Dunn found not guilty of assaulting federal agentJudge dismisses criminal case against Boeing over Max crashes despite skepticismNancy Pelosi announces retirement from CongressTrump bashes Mamdani after Democrats sweep key electionsSupreme Court justices appear skeptical that Trump tariffs are legalCalifornia voters approve new U.S. House map to boost Democrats in 2026Democrats win big on election night in key racesThe Associated Press reported late Friday that more than half a dozen states had \"confirmed that some SNAP recipients already were issued full November payments on Friday.\"The administration asked the 1st Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals for an emergency injunction to block the order that it pay full food stamp benefits pending the outcome of its appeal of that order. A three-judge panel on the appeals court denied that request on Friday.But within hours, Supreme Court Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson temporarily paused the order. Jackson directed the 1st Circuit to quickly rule on the administration's motion to impose an indefinite stay on the lower court's order mandating full benefits.The Trump administration previously said that it would not use a contingency fund containing $4.65 billion to fund the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program in November.U.S. District Court of Rhode Island Judge Jack McConnell on Oct. 31 told the administration to use that fund to pay partial benefits, at least, and to explore other options to provide full benefits.The administration, days later, said it would pay 65% of the benefits, but ruled out using so-called Section 32 funds to make up the difference.The total cost of full SNAP benefits for the month is around $8 billion.The program, like other federal programs, has no currently appropriated money, as a result of Congress failing to pass a spending bill. That failure led to the U.S. government shutdown on Oct. 1.Past administrations have continued paying SNAP benefits during prior shutdowns.",

    "body": "Traditional job interview methods that have a candidate tell, rather than show, their strengths may be responsible for employers \"missing diamonds in the rough,\" says Adam Grant. Instead, he says, interviewers should try incorporating two steps to assess a candidate's true potential and fit for the job.Grant, a bestselling author and organizational psychologist at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, shared tips for improving the interview process while speaking at WOBI's World Business Forum in New York City on Nov. 5.He cited research that \"how well somebody does a job is not indicated by how the first interview goes, it's how much growth they show from the first interview to the second.\"Of course, hiring teams don't always have the time or resources to give everyone a second chance if they flub the first interview. But Grant shared an alternative that still affords candidates a do-over without requiring the hiring team carve out time for another interview.\"Even if you could pause an interview halfway and say, 'Hey, I've got a couple of notes for you,' and then watch the motivation and ability to grow from the first attempt to the second, that is a great window into is somebody excited to get better and also do they have the capability to learn the skills that you're trying to get them to excel at.\"Besides giving feedback and a chance to improve if candidates have a rocky start, Grant includes a task in the interview that's part of the actual job to see a person's skills and potential in action.'I have been guilty of this'Grant shared a personal anecdote of how he almost missed out on hiring a top performer because of his own approach to interviewing applicants. Before becoming an organizational psychologist, he led an advertising team and was hiring salespeople. He recalled one candidate who seemed to be \"the worst fit for sales imaginable\" based on his resume.Grant was desperate to fill the role so he interviewed the applicant regardless, but remained unimpressed. He told the company's president the candidate wouldn't be good for the role because he never made eye contact during the 45-minute interview.\"I didn't know a thing about neurodivergence then,\" Grant noted.The company's president responded, \"You realize this is a phone sales job, right? There is no eye contact in this job.\"Grant suddenly realized he'd been so focused on confirming his belief that the candidate was a poor fit, and he learned a lesson.\"I realized I had to reboot our hiring process,\" he said. \"If you want to gauge somebody's potential, the best thing you can do is actually give them a challenge that's really part of the job and watch how they handle it.\"So he brought all of the candidates back and asked them to sell him a rotten apple. Grant chose that because all of the candidates would be familiar with an apple, so it would level the playing field, and because \"if you could get me excited about a rotten apple, you could definitely sell our products,\" he said.The candidate Grant had frowned upon before dove right in with his sales pitch.\"This may look like a rotten apple; it's actually an aged, antique apple,\" Grant recalled him saying. \"You know the saying 'An apple a day keeps the doctor away?' Well, because of the nutrients in the aging process, you only need to eat one of these a week. And then afterwards you can plant the seeds in your backyard.\"Though Grant joked he had \"some serious honesty and integrity questions\" about the candidate, he hired him, and the man ended up being the best salesperson on the team.\"What I learned from that story was not just that I needed to see him in action to gauge his potential,\" Grant said. \"But also, I needed to give him a do-over.\"Want to level up your AI skills? Sign up for Smarter by CNBC Make It's new online course, How To Use AI To Communicate Better At Work.

    "body": "In 2020, Anita Kinoshita, 28 years old at the time, started looking into buying a house.Kinoshita was living in California and making around $70,000 a year as a software engineer for the Department of Defense.As a first-generation American from a farming family in Mexico, Kinoshita believed the best way to finally achieve the American dream her family had for her was to own property.\"I had my first big girl job and thought the next responsible thing to do would be to buy a house,\" Kinoshita tells CNBC Make It. \"I didn't necessarily want to buy a house. In fact, I was trying to figure out how to finesse the purchase.\"Initially, Kinoshita was seeking a property with the intent to sublet some of the bedrooms and lower her share of the expenses. She had about $20,000 saved for a down payment.\"My vision for the future was to be able to have a family and spend as much time with them and not necessarily have an office job. [But] I still went forward with what made sense for this American Dream path,\" she says.\"I was 28 at the time, so I still kind of cared what my community defined as successful, and homeownership was part of that. At the time, I thought it was the responsible thing to do.\"Kinoshita always believed achieving the American Dream meant owning property.Anita KinoshitaKinoshita wanted to learn as much as she could about the home-buying journey she was embarking on. She enrolled in a nine-week course that teaches people how to manage their money, offered by Financial Peace University.During the retirement module of the online class, Kinoshita used a retirement calculator that helped her realize that if she started contributing a bit more to her 401(k), she could retire around age 55 and buy a house at the same time.\"All of a sudden, the vision I had for the future and the freedom and lifestyle I wanted became possible in my mind for the first time,\" she says.For two years, Kinoshita looked at least a dozen places and put in a total of four offers. She got accepted for one, but then the sellers backed out. She was also approved for a single-family home, but there was a mismatch in the appraisal, so she walked away from the deal.\"I ended up backing out because the only way to be competitive during that time was to invest less and save more for the down payment, and I wasn't willing to do that,\" she says.\"Ultimately, I felt like it wasn't the time for me at the moment, and I was not willing to invest less either. I wasn't satisfied with my career and felt like I was living my dad's dream and not really mine.\"Kinoshita viewed a dozen properties and put in a total of four offers.Anita KinoshitaRedefining successKinoshita switched her focus. Instead of saving for a down payment, she set a goal of having $500,000 invested in her retirement accounts. By April 2022, she had invested $200,000 and reached COAST FIRE — a strategy where you save and invest enough to eventually stop contributing to your retirement accounts and let the compound growth continue rising so you're on track to have a traditional retirement. She decided to quit her job.Kinoshita isn't alone in choosing to wait to buy a house. The median age of a first-time home buyer has gone up in recent years, from 35 in 2023 to 38 in 2024 alone, according to a report from the National Association of Realtors.After quitting her full-time job, Kinoshita started working part-time, creating curriculum for California State University, Monterey Bay and making financial literacy content online. Both of these positions made her more money than when she was working as a software engineer.Kinoshita, now 34, is going to wait until she reaches early COAST FIRE, which, when you have enough invested, lets you stop contributing by the age you decide, versus the traditional retirement age of 67. Kinoshita quit her job and is now making financial literacy content online.Anita KinoshitaHer projected retirement age is now 45, and she expects to have $1.5 million invested by then.\"I value my time and freedom a little bit more than I value home ownership. In retrospect, I think if I had bought the house, I would have felt trapped in my career,\" she says.Kinoshita and her husband recently moved to the California neighborhood where they would one day like to own a home. They pay $4,000 a month in rent and live in a single-family home in a gated community, according to documents reviewed by CNBC Make It.When the couple is ready to buy, she estimates they will have about $300,000 saved to put toward the home. But they still don't know when they will start getting serious about buying.\"I'm not in a rush. I don't want to use it as a financial tool in any way. I'm looking at it more as a luxury and less as an asset these days,\" she says. \"I would rather have my money working for me in the stock market than in real estate.\"Kinoshita and her husband are now renting in the neighborhood they hope to buy one day.Anita KinoshitaKinoshita says her definition of a dream home has also changed.\"I don't want too many bedrooms. I think what I care more about these days is the charming architecture. I don't want it to be overwhelming in terms of square footage. I want it to be in a really beautiful neighborhood where I feel safe. I want to look outside and see nature,\" she says.\"I don't see a reason to settle for something else, so for us it's a as long as it takes kind of thing.\"Want to level up your AI skills? Sign up for Smarter by CNBC Make It's new online course, How To Use AI To Communicate Better At Work.

    "body": "David Ryder | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesHigh valuations for artificial intelligence (AI) stocks were the focus of the market this week, with fears of a potential AI bubble capping investor sentiment. But the view on Wall Street is still that several tech stocks offer strong fundamentals and are delivering rapid, AI-induced growth, justifying their sky-high valuations.The recommendations of top Wall Street analysts can help investors find attractive AI stocks displaying  robust long-term growth outlooks.Here are three stocks favored by the Street's top pros, according to TipRanks, a platform that ranks analysts based on their past performance.AmazonE-commerce and cloud computing giant Amazon (AMZN) recently impressed investors with its upbeat Q3 results. Accelerating growth in the Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud unit confirmed the Street's faith in Amazon's expansion into artificial intelligence.In reaction to the solid Q3 print and the recently-announced deal with OpenAI, Mizuho analyst Lloyd Walmsley increased his price forecast for Amazon to $315 from $300 and reiterated a buy rating. TipRanks' AI Analyst is also bullish on AMZN stock, with an \"outperform\" rating and a price target of $276.Walmsley said that the Q3 performance, OpenAI deal and positive outlook for Amazon's Trainium chips made him more optimistic toward AWS's long-term growth. In fact, the 5-star analyst expects acceleration in AWS revenue growth from 20% in Q3 to 21% in Q4 2025 and 22% in the first quarter of 2026. He expects AWS revenue to rise by 23% to $157 billion in the full year 2026, followed by a 22% increase to $192 billion in 2027 — above the Street's expectations of $154 billion and $185 billion for 2026 and 2027, respectively.\"We believe investors continue to rotate into AMZN shares given a valuation well below its historic ranges and positive news likely to continue into the AWS ReInvent Conference in early December,\" said Walmsley.The analyst's bullish investment thesis is also based on the cost-to-serve improvements in Amazon's retail business, driven by automation in fulfillment centers and an enhanced logistics network.Walmsley ranks No. 103 among more than 10,100 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been successful 64% of the time, delivering an average return of 27.5%. See Amazon Insider Trading Activity on TipRanks.AlphabetThis second stock pick is Google- and YouTube owner Alphabet (GOOGL). The company reported better-than-expected third-quarter results, with AI driving solid momentum in its cloud business.Impressed by the Q3 performance, JPMorgan analyst Doug Anmuth raised his price target for Alphabet to $340 from $300 and reaffirmed a buy rating. In comparison, TipRanks' AI Analyst has a price target of $316 with an \"outperform\" rating on GOOGL.Anmuth highlighted that Q3 marked the first time that Alphabet's quarterly revenue crossed the $100 billion mark. The top-rated analyst noted Alphabet's robust performance in the third quarter, with double-digit growth across every major business.Interestingly, Anmuth believes that Q3 results and favorable insights on AI search formats could change investors' views toward Google's AI search transition. Alphabet noted AI-induced acceleration in query growth and paid clicks, while Anmuth noted that industry conversations indicate that paid clicks using Google's AI Overviews (AIO) and AI Mode (AIM) features are driving higher conversion rates.\"Overall, the AI search transition has been viewed as the greatest risk to Google, but additional signs that AI search is more opportunity than threat will continue to flip the narrative,\" said Anmuth.The analyst is also encouraged by the surge in Google Cloud's backlog to $155 billion. He contends that the figure doesn't include all the gains from the recently announced expansion of GOOGL's partnership with Anthropic, implying a further increase in the backlog at the end of the fourth quarter. Overall, Anmuth is confident about Alphabet's prospects and said it remains JPMorgan's Top 2 idea, behind only Amazon.Anmuth ranks No. 113 among more than 10,100 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been profitable 63% of the time, delivering an average return of 22%. See Alphabet Ownership Structure on TipRanks.Advanced Micro DevicesThe third tech giant this week is chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), which delivered strong results in the third quarter of Fiscal 2025. AMD attributed stronger earnings and revenue to its expanding compute business and fast-growing AI data center segment.In reaction, Stifel analyst Ruben Roy increased his price target for AMD to $280 from $240 and reiterated a buy rating. With a price target of $285, TipRanks' AI Analyst has an \"outperform\" rating on AMD stock.Roy noted that AMD's Q3 top line was driven by strength across the company's data center, AI, server and PC businesses. The 5-star analyst highlighted management's optimism toward continued momentum in Q4 FY25, with revenue expected to grow 25% year-over-year to $9.6 billion. AMD expects Q4 revenue growth will be supported by strong performances in its data center, client and embedded businesses, partially offset by a double-digit decline in the gaming segment.Interestingly, Roy believes that AMD's performance in the near-term is being fueled more by increasing demand for server central processing units and continued share gains in client CPUs rather than data center AI graphics processing units. The analyst expects AMD's data center AI GPU business to increase to a range of $6 billion to $6.5 billion in FY25, versus a prior estimate of $5 billion.\"Looking ahead, we continue to believe that AMD is executing well as the company nears production shipments of the MI400/450 series GPUs and the Helios rack next year,\" Roy said.The analyst is also optimistic on AMD's recently-announced deals with OpenAI and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, saying they provide clarity on the longer-term growth outlook in its data center AI business. Roy awaits further insights from AMD about its technology roadmap and total addressable market (TAM)  at an upcoming Analyst Day event on November 11.Roy ranks No. 20 among more than 10,100 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been profitable 71% of the time, delivering an average return of 34.4%. See AMD Statistics on TipRanks.",

    "body": "U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy holds a press conference on the impact of the government shutdown on air travel, at LaGuardia Airport in the Queens borough of New York City, U.S., October 28, 2025. Shannon Stapleton | ReutersCommercial air travel in the U.S. will be reduced to \"a trickle\" ahead of Thanksgiving as a result of rising air traffic control staffing shortages, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy.The Trump administration last ordered airlines to cut 4% of domestic flights at 40 major U.S. airports due to staffing shortages starting last Friday. That number is set to rise to 10% next Friday if the shutdown doesn't end. Government officials blamed \"increased reports of strain on the system from both pilots and air traffic controllers\" in large part due to the government shutdown — now the longest in U.S. history.Air traffic controller shortages snarled travel at major airports coast-to-coast over the weekend, in addition to the hundreds of flights airlines had already canceled under the order. So far this weekend, 12,727 U.S. flights were canceled and 4,057, according to FlightAware.Airlines for America, an industry group that represents the largest U.S. airlines, said 71% of the delay time on Saturday was due to air traffic staffing shortfalls.The country's airlines will have to cut hundreds more flights in the week ahead if Congress can't come to a swift solution to end the shutdown. Late Friday, Senate Republicans rejected a Democrat proposal to reopen the government.Air traffic controllers, along with airport security screeners, are required to work during the shutdown without receiving their regular paychecks. Federal workers will miss their second full paycheck on Monday, according to their union. Some controllers have taken second jobs to make ends meet, union officials have said.On Sunday, Duffy warned air travel in the run-up to Thanksgiving is \"only going to get worse\" if the shutdown drags on.\"The two weeks before Thanksgiving, you're going to see air travel be reduced to a trickle,\" he said on CNN's \"State of the Union.\"Travel around Thanksgiving Day — this year taking place on Nov. 27 — is typically among the busiest of the year as millions of people head home for the holidays.\"Many of them are not going to be able to get on an airplane, because there are not going to be that many flights that fly if this thing doesn't open back up,\" he said.Airlines cautioned travelers to expect delays and urged lawmakers to end the shutdown.\"Due to the prolonged government shutdown and nationwide air traffic control staffing shortages, we, like most airlines, are experiencing additional and widespread delays and cancellations across the country today despite the advanced cancellations that the FAA required us to make,\" American Airlines said in a notice to customers Saturday. \"We, again, urge leaders in Washington, D.C., to reach an immediate resolution to end the shutdown.\"Almost 2,200 U.S. flights were canceled on Saturday as of 9:30 p.m. ET, about 7% of the day's schedule, according to aviation-data firm Cirium. Around a third of that number was canceled early in the day, on par with a day of severe thunderstorms, which can be disruptive, though they're routine. Cirium said Friday ranked as the 72nd worst for cancellations since Jan. 1, 2024.Under the FAA's order, the flight cuts, first set at 4% of flights will increase to 6% of schedules, 8% by Thursday and 10% next Friday. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy told Fox News on Friday that cuts could eventually reach up to 20% of schedules, although he didn't elaborate. Airlines weren't required to cut international flights.watch nowThe disruptions are occurring at a generally low travel season, but the key Thanksgiving holiday weekend is less than three weeks away. The impact for airlines could quadruple given how fares during that high-demand period spike, Seaport Research Partners airline analyst Daniel McKenzie said in a note on Friday.Airlines this week waived date-change fees for travelers on affected flights and noted they can also request a refund.Airline executives stated that many customers were being rebooked on alternative flights, while last-minute changes sent others scrambling for other arrangements. Hertz, for example, stated on Thursday that, when the FAA made its flight-cut announcement, one-way car rentals increased by 20% over the same two-day period a year earlier.Delays rose throughout the day Saturday, with more than 6,700 late-arriving U.S. flights, according to FlightAware. Air traffic control staffing shortages prompted delays at major airports including Delta Air Lines hub Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport, San Francisco International Airport, John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York, United Airlines hubs Newark Liberty International Airport in New Jersey and Houston's George Bush Intercontinental Airport, and at  Charlotte Douglas International Airport, a busy American hub, as well as Chicago O'Hare International Airport.Here are the airports where the FAA and DOT cuts apply:Impacted airports:ANC - Anchorage InternationalATL - Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta InternationalBOS - Boston Logan InternationalBWI - Baltimore/Washington InternationalCLT - Charlotte Douglas InternationalCVG - Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky InternationalDAL - Dallas LoveDCA - Ronald Reagan Washington NationalDEN - Denver InternationalDFW - Dallas/Fort Worth InternationalDTW - Detroit Metropolitan Wayne CountyEWR - Newark Liberty InternationalFLL - Fort Lauderdale/Hollywood InternationalHNL - Honolulu InternationalHOU - Houston HobbyIAD - Washington Dulles InternationalIAH - George Bush Houston IntercontinentalIND - Indianapolis InternationalJFK - New York John F.

The food stamp program, now known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), may run out of funding on November 1st due to the federal government shutdown, which is now entering its second month. In Miami-Dade County, nearly one in six residents receives food assistance. (Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)Joe Raedle | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesThe Supreme Court on Friday night temporarily paused a federal judge's order that directed the Trump administration to pay full SNAP benefits to 42 million Americans for November by the end of the day.The move came hours after the 1st Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals in Boston denied the administration's emergency request to halt the order relating to food stamp benefits to primarily low-income people.But the appeals court also said it would soon rule on whether the administration was entitled to a stay of the order by U.S. District Court in Rhode Island Judge Jack McConnell while its appeal of the order plays out.Supreme Court Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, in the order on Friday night in favor of the administration, pushed the 1st Circuit to quickly determine whether to issue that stay.\"The applicants assert that, without intervention from this Court, they will have to 'transfer an estimated $4 billion by tonight' to fund SNAP benefits through November,\" Jackson wrote.That money was to come from so-called Section 32 funds that the Trump administration said it did not want to use to augment a partial payment of SNAP benefits that federal officials planned to make. The partial benefits payment would come from $4.6 billion in contingency funds set aside by Congress for that purpose.The administration originally planned not to pay any SNAP benefits in November because of the ongoing government shutdown.\"Given the First Circuit's representations, an administrative stay is required to facilitate the First Circuit's expeditious resolution of the pending stay motion,\" Jackson wrote.She said that the Supreme Court's stay \"will terminate forty-eight hours after the First Circuit's resolution of the pending motion, which the First Circuit is expected to issue with dispatch.\"That two-day window would give time for the Trump administration, or plaintiffs in the case, to return to the Supreme Court to challenge any ruling by the 1st Circuit.It is not clear to what extent Jackson's order will affect payments of SNAP benefits.The U.S. Department of Agriculture earlier Friday told states it would begin disbursing full SNAP benefits to comply with McConnell's order, even as the administration appealed the ruling.The USDA's memo did not suggest that the administration would renege on that plan even if a higher court blocked the order.The Associated Press reported late Friday that more than half a dozen states had \"confirmed that some SNAP recipients already were issued full November payments on Friday.\"New York Attorney General Letitia James, in a statement on Jackson's order, said, \"This decision is a tragedy for the millions of Americans who rely on SNAP to feed their families.\"\"It is disgraceful that the Trump administration chose to fight this in court instead of fulfilling its responsibility to the American people,\" said James, whose state is one of the plaintiffs in another pending lawsuit seeking for force full SNAP benefits to be paid.\"Every day the federal government delays is another day that children, seniors, and families face real pain and suffering,\" Read more CNBC government shutdown coverageDuffy warns air travel will be ‘reduced to a trickle’ as the shutdown drags onTrump tells Republicans to send health insurance money 'directly to the people'Food banks in ‘disaster response mode’ due to shutdown, SNAP cuts, leaders saySenate Republicans reject Democrat deal to reopen governmentDemocratic leader offers deal to reopen government but Republicans sneerTrump admin asks Supreme Court to block order it pay full SNAP benefitsSNAP benefits must be fully paid by Trump administration by Friday, judge ordersDC sandwich thrower Sean Dunn found not guilty of assaulting federal agentJudge dismisses criminal case against Boeing over Max crashes despite skepticismNancy Pelosi announces retirement from CongressTrump bashes Mamdani after Democrats sweep key electionsSupreme Court justices appear skeptical that Trump tariffs are legalCalifornia voters approve new U.S. House map to boost Democrats in 2026Democrats win big on election night in key racesThe administration last week said it would not pay any SNAP benefits in November because of the federal shutdown, which began on Oct. 1 when Congress failed to pass a bill to provide short-term funding for federal programs, including food stamps. Past administrations have paid the benefits during other shutdowns.A group of plaintiffs, comprised of cities, unions, nonprofits, and a retailer, then sued the administration in Rhode Island federal court, asking McConnell to order that full benefits be paid for the month.McConnell on Oct. 31 ordered the administration to disburse at least partial SNAP benefits as soon as possible by tapping the contingency fund.He also ordered the administration to explore whether other pools of previously appropriated money could be used to fully fund SNAP, which costs about $8 billion per month.The administration on Monday said it would pay 50% of SNAP benefits in November by using the contingency funds. But it refused to use another $4 billion from a Section 32 fund that would have made up the difference in the SNAP payments. The administration two days later said a re-calculation found it could pay 65% of the SNAP benefits from the contingency fund.The plaintiffs then urged McConnell to order the administration to make the full SNAP payments from available funds. The judge did so on Thursday, saying at a hearing that the administration's decision to rule out Section 32 funds was \"arbitrary and capricious.\" \"People have gone without for too long,\" McConnell said.\"The evidence shows that people will go hungry, food pantries will be overburdened, and needless suffering will occur\" if SNAP is not fully funded, he wrote in an order.The administration on Friday morning asked the 1st Circuit appeals court to block McConnell's order, even as the USDA issued its memo to states saying that it intended to comply with the ruling.On Friday night, a three-judge panel on that appeals court denied the administration's request.The panel noted that \"the government has not disputed that it may under [federal law] use the Section 32 fund to cover the provision of SNAP benefits for\" November.But the panel also said that the \"government's motion for a stay pending appeal [of McConnell's order] remains pending, and we intend to issue a decision on that motion as quickly as possible.\"",

    "body": "Everyone who knows me knows that I can't stand owing money. I pay down my credit cards every month, and I complete Venmo requests the second I get them.The only debt I have left is my student loan, which has been on minimum payment autopilot since I graduated from college in 2013. For many years, I left those payments on the back burner, funneling any extra savings I had toward my investments.Recently, though, my financial strategy changed after my fiancé and I began planning for a wedding in summer 2027. I sold a fair amount of stock and dialed back my retirement contributions in order to build our wedding fund.For the first time in my life, I'm sitting on a pile of cash. And I have to say, I'm very tempted to use a chunk of it to wipe out my loan.Hear me out. My student debt carries an interest rate of 6.55% and is scheduled to be paid off in late 2027. If I paid my loan off now, I could take my monthly loan payment, plus a few extra dollars, tack it on to my regular contributions to the wedding fund, and still hit our funding goal on time. Plus, I'd be debt-free.I chatted with a few certified financial planners, and pretty much everyone agreed that the math works in my favor.\"If you have the funds available, paying off the loans first is a smart move,\" says MaryAnne Gucciardi, a CFP with Wealthmind Financial Planning. \"That's a guaranteed 6.55% 'return,' which is higher than what you're likely earning in even the best high-yield savings account.\"So as you're reading this, I've already paid the loan off, right? Well, no. I actually decided against it. Here's why.My decision to hold off on repaying my loan, for nowThe mathematical principle Gucciardi points out is an important one that applies to a broad array of situations in personal finance. Paying down a loan with a particular interest rate is equivalent to earning an annualized return on an investment.It's a quick and dirty way to decide how to prioritize your financial goals. If you have credit card debt at 20% — currently right around the average, according to Bankrate — paying it down is like earning 20% a year in the stock market. Because that's a figure your portfolio is unlikely to earn on a long-term basis, the thinking goes, you're better off prioritizing the debt.The same logic applies to my loan. The 3.4% annual percentage yield we're earning in our savings account falls short of the 6.55% I owe on my loans.The cost of making such a move, Gucciardi and others pointed out to me, is liquidity. Once I make the lump sum payment, I won't be able to go to my student loan servicer and ask for my money back. Catching up by the time of our wedding date is as easy as redirecting the freed-up cash from my student loan payment to put toward the wedding fund. But a lot could go wrong between now and then.What if I lose my job? Or one of us needs expensive medical treatment? Or elements of our wedding end up costing much more than we budgeted for? I have emergency savings, but a few things going wrong could make what looked really easy on paper into something really hard in real life.So I did some more math. I've paid off 81% of my student debt, meaning that the vast majority of my payment these days goes toward paying down the principal rather than the interest. By my calculations, paying the loan now, instead of continuing with minimum payments, would save me somewhere between $400 and $500 in interest.\"That net difference is the price of financial flexibility,\" says Sean Pearson, a CFP with Ameriprise Financial Services. \"It's the price of doing the things that you want to do that are the most important to you when you need to get them done.\"To be clear, my financial priorities might not be the same as yours, and it's worth discussing your own goals with a financial advisor. Right now, the wedding is the most important thing I'm saving money for. I want it be everything my fiancé and I envision, and I want our (frankly, too many) guests to have an amazing time. Having the extra cash on hand in case anything comes up is worth paying my student loan servicer an extra $400.It's a lesson I'm applying to my broader financial life too. While certain financial strategies are mathematically optimal, they may not fit within my particular set of goals.\"While imperfect, the best solution is often to make a budget that allows you to reach your priorities when they exist on your timeline and remember that the calendar is as important to your financial plan as your calculator,\" Pearson says.Want to level up your AI skills? Sign up for Smarter by CNBC Make It's new online course, How To Use AI To Communicate Better At Work.

    "body": "Over 95% of international data and voice call traffic travels through nearly a million miles of underwater communication cables.These cables carry government communications, financial transactions, email, video calls and streaming around the world.The first commercial telecommunication subsea cable was used for telegraphs and was laid across the English Channel between Dover, England and Calais, France in 1850.The technology then evolved to coaxial cables that carried telephone conversations, and most recently, fiber optics that ferry data and the internet as we know it.\"About ten years ago, we saw the advent of another big category, which is the webscale players and the likes of Meta, Google, Amazon, etc., who represent now probably 50% of the overall market,\" said Paul Gabla, chief sales officer at Alcatel Submarine Networks.Alcatel is the world's largest subsea cable manufacturer and installer, according to industry trade magazine Submarine Telecoms Forum.Demand for subsea cables is increasing as tech giants race to develop computation-intensive artificial intelligence models and connect their growing networks of data centers.Investment into new subsea cable projects is expected to reach around $13 billion between 2025-2027, almost twice the amount that was invested between 2022 and 2024, according to telecommunications data provider firm TeleGeography.A map of the world's undersea communication cables.CNBC | Jason ReginatoBig Tech, big cables\"AI is increasing the need that we have for subsea infrastructure,\" said Alex Aime, vice president of network investments at Meta. \"Oftentimes when people think about AI, they think about data centers, they think about compute, they think about data. But the reality is, without the connectivity that connects those data centers, what you have are really expensive warehouses.\"In February, the company announced Project Waterworth, a 50,000km (31,000-mile) cable that will connect five continents, making it the world's longest subsea cable project.Meta will be the sole owner of Waterworth, which the company says will be a multi-year, multi-billion-dollar project.Amazon also recently announced its first wholly-owned subsea cable project called Fastnet.Fastnet will connect Maryland's eastern shore to County Cork, Ireland, and capacity will exceed 320 terabits per second, which is equivalent to streaming 12.5 million HD movies simultaneously, according to Amazon.\"Subsea is really essential for AWS and for any connectivity internationally across oceans,\" Matt Rehder, Amazon Web Services vice president of core networking, told CNBC in an interview about Amazon's subsea cable investments. \"Without subsea you'd have to rely on satellite connectivity, which can work. But satellite has higher latency, higher costs, and you just can't get enough capacity or throughput to what our customers and the internet in general needs.\"A ship belonging to Alcatel Submarine Networks deploys a plow to install subsea telecommunications cables.Alcatel Submarine NetworksGoogle is another large player, having invested in over 30 subsea cables.One of the company's latest projects is Sol, which will connect the U.S., Bermuda, the Azores and Spain.Microsoft has also invested in the infrastructure.\"You've seen this huge growth in submarine cables over the past 20 years. And this is driven by just a voracious demand for data,\" says Matthew Mooney, director of global issues at cybersecurity firm Recorded Future.Cut cablesDisruptions due to cable damage can be quite significant, particularly in areas served by few internet connections.\"If you cut a cable, you can cut off multiple countries from internet access, and that includes financial transactions, banking, e-commerce and basic communications,\" said Erin Murphy, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a nonprofit national security research organization.That very thing happened to Tonga, an island nation east of Australia.In 2022, debris from an underwater volcanic eruption severed the island's only subsea communication cable, cutting the island off from the rest of the world.In September, cuts to subsea cables in the Red Sea caused disruptions to Microsoft's Azure cloud service. The company was able to re-route traffic, but users in Asia and the Middle East still faced increased latency problems and degraded performance.Experts have said that the majority of subsea cable damage is accidental, usually due to fishing activity or a ship accidentally dropping its anchor on a cable. But lately, these cables are becoming the suspected targets of sabotage.A subsea cable being manufactured at Alcatel Submarine Networks factory in Calais, France.CNBC\"When you have so many vessels in international waters that are highly trafficked by lots of commercial vessels or fishing vessels, the likelihood of accidents is fairly high,\" Murphy said. \"But if you're a hostile actor, you know that as well. So if you're sending out the so-called Russian ghost fleet, or if you have a Chinese fishing vessel and a cable is accidentally cut, you could just say, 'Oh, well, it was an accident.' But it could be intentional. So it's really hard to discern sometimes when an act of damage is actually intentional or accidental.\"Mooney and Recorded Future have been tracking some of these cases of suspected sabotage.\"I would say that we have seen a significant uptick in what we would consider intentional damages,\" Mooney said. \"In 2024 and 2025, [we] saw a notable increase in incidents that occurred in the Baltic Sea and around Taiwan. And so it is difficult to be able to determine with 100% validity that these are intentional. However, the fact patterns that emerge from these events does give you cause to be suspicious that they could all be considered accidental.\"Mooney said the increase in suspected sabotage has corresponded to increased tensions between Russia and Ukraine and China and Taiwan.Despite there being a lack of concrete evidence of subsea cable sabotage, governments are taking the threat seriously.In January, NATO launched the \"Baltic Sentry\" following several incidents of cable cuts in the Baltic Sea. The operation involves deploying drones, aircraft and subsea and surface vessels to safeguard the subsea infrastructure in the region.\"As a result, I don't believe we've seen any instances of cable severing since late January 2025, in the Baltic Sea,\" Mooney said.A picture taken on February 4, 2025 shows a Helicopter 15 (HKP15) (L) on the flight deck of patrol ship HMS Carlskrona (P04) on open water near Karlskrona, Sweden, as part of the NATO Baltic Sea patrol mission, the Baltic Sentry, aimed to secure critical underwater infrastructure. The patrol ship HMS Carlskrona (P04) set off from the naval port in Karlskrona on February 4, 2025 to become part of NATO's Baltic Sentry operation as one of several Swedish ships that are part of Standing NATO Maritime Group One (SNMG1). This is the first time the ship has hoisted the NATO flag on board. The purpose of NATO's Baltic Sentry operation is to demonstrate presence and secure critical underwater infrastructure.

We also spoke to government officials and tech giants to find out why subsea cables are crucial to keeping us connected and what we can do to protect this critical infrastructure.Watch the video to get the full story.",

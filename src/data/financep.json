    "body": "Illustration of food items placed on the belt of a cash register in a Leclerc supermarket in Valence, France, April 4, 2025.   Nicolas Guyonnet | Afp | Getty ImagesEuro zone inflation cooled to 1.7% in January, flash data from statistics agency Eurostat showed Wednesday. Economists polled by Reuters had expected the inflation rate to dip to 1.7%, down from 2% in December.Core inflation, which excludes more volatile energy, food, alcohol and tobacco prices, stood at 2.2% in January, down a touch from the 2.3% seen in the year to December.The latest data shows the key inflation rate has now dipped below the European Central Bank's 2% target, meaning it's likely to steer clear of any more rate cuts for the foreseeable future. Cautious approachThe central bank next meets on Thursday and is expected to hold its benchmark interest rate at 2%. Economists expect no change in the coming months either, but note that there are a few factors that might change the ECB's stance. Lorenzo Codogno, founder and chief economist at Lorenzo Codogno Macro Advisors, said these could include an escalation of geopolitical tensions, a sharp appreciation of the euro, or somewhat higher-than-expected inflation prints. \"The ECB remains in a 'good spot' or 'good place,' but ECB speakers may become more reluctant to use such wording amid global uncertainty and fragility,\" he said in emailed comments Tuesday. \"I continue to see a small downside risk for policy rates in the near term and some upside risk in the medium term. Yet the baseline scenario remains the same: no change in 2026 and 2027, with the bar for action high,\" he noted. Paul Hollingsworth, head of DM Economics at BNP Paribas Markets 360, agreed that the threshold for any policy action this year was high, and the next move could well be a hike.\"We see a high bar for any policy action, and stronger-than-anticipated underlying price pressures suggest the ECB will favour a steady hand for a prolonged period,\" he said in emailed comments last week.\"We continue to see the next move as a hike, in the third quarter of 2027, by which point we expect more evidence of stronger domestic price pressures stemming from the impact of higher defence and infrastructure spending,\" he said.",

    "body": "Eli Lilly and Company’s logo is displayed during a press conference in Houston, Texas, U.S., Sept. 23, 2025.   Antranik Tavitian | ReutersEli Lilly on Wednesday posted fourth-quarter earnings and revenue and 2026 guidance that blew past estimates, as demand for its blockbuster weight loss drug Zepbound and diabetes treatment Mounjaro soars. The pharmaceutical giant anticipates its 2026 revenue will come in between $80 billion and $83 billion. Analysts expected revenue of $77.62 billion, according to LSEG. Lilly also expected adjusted earnings to be between $33.50 and $35 per share for the year. That compares with analysts' estimate of $33.23 per share, according to LSEG.The strong outlook comes days after Lilly CEO Dave Ricks told CNBC in an exclusive interview that he expects upcoming government Medicare coverage of obesity treatments to expand the U.S. market for those drugs this year, saying it's a \"big multiplier on the eligible pool\" of patients. Lilly's guidance comes in stark contrast to the outlook of rival Novo Nordisk, which is also grappling with lower prices in the U.S. following landmark deals both companies struck with President Donald Trump to slash obesity and diabetes drug costs. Unlike Lilly, Novo warned on Tuesday that it sees sales and profit declining this year, as prices fall in the U.S. and exclusivity expires for its blockbuster obesity and diabetes drugs in China, Brazil and Canada. Lilly is working to maintain its dominance in the booming market for those drugs, called GLP-1s, as Novo sees an explosive U.S. launch for its new Wegovy pill for obesity. Lilly hopes to win approval for its own oral weight loss drug, orforglipron, later this year. Mounjaro raked in $7.41 billion in revenue for the quarter, up 110% from the same period a year ago. U.S. sales for Mounjaro were $4.1 billion, up 57%, as demand climbed but realized prices were lower. Those numbers surpassed what analysts were expecting for the quarter, according to StreetAccount.Zepbound, which entered the market roughly three years ago, posted $4.2 billion in U.S. revenue for the fourth quarter. That's up 122% from the year-earlier period, as demand for the drug also rose while realized prices dropped. Analysts were expecting $3.91 billion in U.S. sales for Zepbound, according to StreetAccount.Here's what the company reported for the fourth quarter compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG: Earnings per share: $7.54 adjusted vs. $6.67 expectedRevenue: $19.29 billion vs. $17.96 billion expectedEli Lilly shares climbed more than 7% in premarket trading.The company posted fourth-quarter revenue of $19.29 billion, up 43% from the same period a year ago. Revenue in the U.S. climbed to $12.9 billion. Eli Lilly said that was driven by a 50% increase in volume — or the number of prescriptions or units sold — for its products, primarily for Mounjaro and Zepbound. That was partially offset by lower realized prices of those drugs, the company said.The pharmaceutical giant booked net income of $6.64 billion, or $7.39 per share, for the fourth quarter. That compares with net income of $4.41 billion, or $4.88 per share, a year earlier. Excluding one-time items associated with the value of intangible assets and other adjustments, Eli Lilly posted earnings of $7.54 per share for the fourth quarter.Novo and Lilly's deals with Trump are expected to eventually increase the number of prescriptions but ultimately hurt total sales.Under the agreements, Lilly and Novo agreed to slash the prices of those treatments for Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries in 2026 and offer them directly to consumers at a discount on the Trump administration's direct-to-consumer platform, TrumpRx, which has yet to launch. In return, both companies will also get a three-year exemption from tariffs. In the interview with CNBC on Friday, Lilly's  Ricks acknowledged that under the drug pricing deal, there will be \"a step down in pricing\" early this year. But he said volume growth of the company's drugs \"will ramp on the back half of the year.\"",

    "body": "Russian President Vladimir Putin and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi sit in a car during a welcoming ceremony at the Palam Air Base in New Delhi, India December 4, 2025. Grigory Sysoev | Via ReutersA day after President Donald Trump said India agreed to halt purchases of Russian oil as part of a new U.S.-India trade deal, the Kremlin said it has heard nothing from New Delhi to suggest those flows are stopping.\"We haven't heard any statements from Delhi on this matter yet,\" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said, in comments reported by news agency RIA Novosti.\"We respect bilateral U.S,-Indian relations,\" Peskov told reporters. \"But we attach no less importance to the development of an advanced strategic partnership between Russia and India.\"\"This is the most important thing for us, and we intend to further develop our bilateral relations with Delhi,\" he said.Russia's Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak, a former oil minister, downplayed any potential loss of Indian custom, telling reporters Tuesday: \"We're only seeing public statements. We'll see how the situation develops.\" \"But overall, our energy resource is in demand; we see this often. Supply will always find demand, because the balance is maintained,\" he said in comments reported by TASS. Skepticism rifeTrump announced that a trade deal had been reached with India in a post on Truth Social on Monday, saying an agreement had been reached during a call with Modi.\"We spoke about many things, including Trade, and ending the War with Russia and Ukraine,\" Trump said, adding: \"He agreed to stop buying Russian Oil, and to buy much more from the United States and, potentially, Venezuela.\"watch nowTrump said the U.S. would cut the main tariff on India from 25% to 18%, and would remove an additional 25% penalty tariff it had imposed on New Delhi last summer in retaliation for its Russian oil purchases.Modi confirmed the latest deal with the U.S. had been done, posting on X Monday that he was \"delighted that Made in India products will now have a reduced tariff of 18%.\" India is certainly seen to have curbed its Russian oil purchases as a result of Washington's punitive 25% duty, but analysts are skeptical that the country, which became a top buyer of discounted Russian crude following the start of the Ukraine war in 2022, is about to completely end these purchases given its need for cheap oil, a desire to its foreign policy autonomy, and to maintain close geopolitical and defense ties with Russia.\"I have a hard time believing the government of India will make any Russian oil-related commitment explicit,\" Evan A. Feigenbaum, vice president for studies at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said in analysis Tuesday.\"After all, India has deep historical and sentimental ties to Russia that it will not simply ditch under American pressure,\" he noted, adding: \"Maintaining the symbolic hedge that it can purchase Russian oil if it so chooses speaks both to Indian foreign policy autonomy and to its ability to resist American coercion, both of which are important factors in India's domestic politics.\"Read moreFeigenbaum noted that while there were signs suggesting that New Delhi had already been incrementally reducing its imports of Russian crude, publicly rebuking Russia was always a \"nonstarter\" for Modi who, he said, \"can ill afford to humiliate one of India's most important defense partners.\" Balancing actFarwa Aamer, director of South Asia Initiatives at the Asia Society Policy Institute, agreed that New Delhi would be reluctant to dump a trading partner with whom it has deepened relations in recent years. Still, India would also be keen to not scupper its rapprochement with the States after months of trade tensions.\"For India, the Russia question remains,\" he said in emailed comments Tuesday.\"Even though it has and will change its oil import structure away from Russia, India would still want to keep relations steady. It will be a balancing act for sure as India navigates these two crucial relationships simultaneously,\" he added.A storage tank at an oil refinery operated by Bharat Petroleum Corp. Ltd., in Mumbai, India,  on Friday, April 4, 2025. Bloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesMoodys Ratings agency said India was unlikely to turn away from Russian oil completely, given the potential economic impact of doing so, including increased manufacturing costs and higher consumer prices.\"Even though India has reduced its purchase of crude oil from Russia in recent months, it is unlikely to cease all purchases immediately which could be disruptive to India's economic growth,\" Moody's Ratings agency commented Tuesday.\"A complete shift toward non-Russian oil could also tighten supply elsewhere, raise prices and pass through to higher inflation given that India is one of the world's largest oil importers.\"",

    "body": "A Chipotle in the Bronx in New York, April 23, 2025.Spencer Platt | Getty ImagesChipotle Mexican Grill on Tuesday reported quarterly earnings and revenue that topped analysts' expectations, although traffic to its restaurants fell for the fourth straight quarter.For 2026, the company is projecting flat same-store sales growth, signaling that the burrito chain's woes are not expected to disappear quickly. Chipotle ended a bumpy 2025 with a full-year same-store sales decline of 1.7%, marking the first annual decline since 2016.However, executives said the outlook is \"conservative,\" citing unpredictable consumer trends. Last year, the company cut its full-year forecast for same-store sales three times as dining habits shifted from quarter to quarter.Shares of the company fell as much as 11% in extended trading.Here's what the company reported compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:Earnings per share: 25 cents adjusted vs. 24 cents expectedRevenue: $2.98 billion vs. $2.96 billion expectedThe fast-casual chain reported fourth-quarter net income of $330.9 million, or 25 cents per share, down from $331.8 million, or 24 cents per share, a year earlier.Excluding impairment costs, gains from terminating restaurant leases and other items, Chipotle earned 25 cents per share.Net sales rose 4.9% to $2.98 billion.The company's same-store sales fell 2.5% for the quarter, making this reporting period the third quarter of the year with same-store sales declines. However, Wall Street was anticipating a steeper same-store sales decrease of 3%, according to StreetAccount estimates.Traffic to Chipotle restaurants fell by 3.2%. Executives have previously said they have seen a pullback in spending from consumers of all income cohorts, although low-income diners have made the most significant shift to their behavior.Over the past year, shares of Chipotle have lost roughly a third of their value, dragging the company's market value down to about $51 billion, as of Tuesday's close. Investor enthusiasm for the stock waned after the fast-casual chain began reporting shrinking traffic to its restaurants.To bring back customers, Chipotle is focusing on improving the chain's operations and adding new menu items, rather than leaning into discounts. In December, at the tail end of the quarter, the company unveiled \"protein cups,\" with the goal of convincing protein-obsessed customers to stop by for a snack, not just lunch or dinner.\"I think having a taco at $3.50 and a protein cup around $3.80 across the country is really an approachable price point that really gives the consumer a meaningful way into the brand, but also solves for those people that are looking for a different choice, whether they're GLP-1 users or looking for other dietary restrictions, more high protein or high fiber,\" CEO Scott Boatwright said on a conference call with analysts.Chipotle is trying to raise menu prices at a slower pace than inflation in the hopes of attracting price-conscious consumers. However, the company also has a strong base of high-income customers.\"After looking at the data last week, we learned that 60% of our core users are over $100,000 a year in income and average household income,\" Boatwright said, adding that the chain plans to target those customers more this year.Chipotle opened 132 company-owned locations and seven restaurants run by international licensees during the quarter. That brought its total to 334 company-owned locations and 11 international partner restaurants opened for the year. In 2026, the company is projecting that it will open 350 to 370 new restaurants, including 10 to 15 international locations that will be run by licensees.",

    "body": "A cargo ship transits through Panama Canal Cocoli locks in Panama City on February 21, 2025.Martin Bernetti | Afp | Getty ImagesThe Chinese government has condemned a ruling from Panama's top court, warning the Central American country \"will inevitably pay a heavy price\" unless it changes course.The rebuke comes shortly after Panama's Supreme Court ruled to void Hong Kong-based CK Hutchison's licence to operate ports at either end of the Panama Canal.The ruling was seen as a major victory for the Trump administration's security ambitions in the Western Hemisphere, given that the White House has made blocking China's influence over the critically important waterway one of its top priorities. In a commentary posted on Tuesday on its WeChat account, the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State Council said the \"logically flawed\" and \"utterly ridiculous\" ruling was opposed by the Chinese government and the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region government.\"The Panamanian authorities should recognize the situation and correct their course,\" the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office said, according to a Google translation. \"If they persist in their own way and remain obstinate, they will inevitably pay a heavy price in terms of politics and economics!\" watch nowIn a brief statement on Jan. 29, Panama's top court said the terms under which Panama Ports Company (PPC), a subsidiary of CK Hutchison, runs the port of Balboa on the Pacific Coast and Cristóbal on the Atlantic side of the Panama Canal violated its constitution. The ruling came around a year after U.S. President Donald Trump threatened to seize control of the Panama Canal, saying the waterway was \"vital to our country\" and claiming, \"it's being operated by China.\"'Extensive damages'The comments from the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office reflect an escalation in tone from China's initial response to the ruling. A spokesperson for China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said on Friday that the decision was \"contrary to the laws governing Panama's approval of the relevant franchises, and that the companies will reserve all rights, including legal proceedings.\" Beijing said it would take all necessary measures to safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese companies. PPC, which has held the contract to operate the ports of Balboa and Cristóbal since the 1990s, also said that the decision was inconsistent with the relevant legal framework.

In a statement, the company said PPC would seek \"extensive damages\" over the ruling, without specifying the damages sought.Shares of CK Hutchison were up over 2% on Wednesday. The stock has climbed more than 23% so far this year. ",

    "body": "Dara Khosrowshahi, CEO of UBER, speaking on CNBC's Squawk Box at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland on Jan. 22nd, 2026. \nOscar Molina | CNBCUber reported better-than-expected revenue in its fourth-quarter earnings report on Wednesday. Shares sank premarket after the release.Here's how the company did versus LSEG consensus estimates for the period ended in December:Earnings per share: 71 cents adjusted Revenue: $14.37 billion vs. $14.32 billion estimatedRevenue increased from $12 billion a year earlier, Uber said in its earnings release. The mobility segment, its ride-hailing platform, generated revenue of of $8.2 billion, up 19% from a year ago, while delivery revenue climbed 30% to $4.9 billion.Analysts were expecting mobility revenue of $8.3 billion and delivery revenue of $4.72 billion, according to StreetAccount. Net income for the quarter was $296 million, which included a $1.6 billion \"net pre-tax headwind from revaluations of our equity investments,\" the company said. Net income a year earlier was $6.88 billion.Uber reported gross bookings of $54.1 billion for the quarter, topping the average analyst estimate of $53.1 billion, according to StreetAccount. Gross bookings for the first quarter are expected to increase at least 17% from a year earlier to between $52 billion and $53.5 billion. The company's strongest revenue growth for the quarter was in its delivery business, which started with restaurants and now includes groceries and retail. Partnerships with OpenTable, Shopify, and store brands such as Loblaws in Canada, Biedronka in Poland, Seiyu in Japan and Coles in Australia helped drive expansion.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconUber one-day stock chartIn prepared remarks ahead of the earnings call, CEO Dara Khosrowshahi said delivery growth last year was highest for Uber in the Europe, Middle East and Africa region.Uber's report lands during a time of transition for the ride-hail industry as autonomous vehicles become more commonplace, especially in urban markets.Echoing a viewpoint he shared a year ago, Khosrowshahi said he's even more convinced that \"AVs will unlock a multi-trillion dollar opportunity,\" adding that \"autonomy fundamentally amplifies the strengths of our existing platform.\"In Atlanta and Austin, Texas, where Uber offered autonomous rides in 2025, overall trip growth \"significantly accelerated\" even for human drivers, the company said in a shareholder deck. In San Francisco, where Uber doesn't yet have a robotaxi option, \"the addition of AV supply to the market has grown the category overall,\" Khosrowshahi said. Alphabet's Waymo has operated a driverless ride-hailing service via its own app in San Francisco since 2024. In some markets, Waymo offers its robotaxi rides exclusively via the Uber app.An Uber Eats bag in the Brooklyn borough of New York, US, on Thursday, Jan. 15, 2026. Michael Nagle | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesBy the end of 2026, Uber expects to be facilitating AV trips in up to 15 cities globally, split between the U.S. and other countries, Khosrowshahi said. \"And by 2029, we intend to be the largest facilitator of AV trips in the world,\" he added. Forthcoming cities include Houston, Los Angeles and San Francisco, as well as London, Munich, Hong Kong, Zurich and Madrid.But Khosrowshahi cautioned that \"autonomous vehicles are likely to remain a very small portion of the rideshare category for many years to come,\" given technological, regulatory and other hurdles to their broader adoption.Uber is also focused on growing its Uber One program, with members tending to book more rides and buy more items through Uber after they subscribe. The company is investing in its advertising business as well. Playing into the surging popularity of generative artificial intelligence, Uber said it's working to \"expand discovery and reach new customers,\" via integrations with ChatGPT, allowing users to \"discover services and restaurants\" before completing their checkouts.

Lori Van Buren | Albany Times Union | Getty ImagesThe harsh winter storm hitting much of the country over the holiday weekend took its toll on the mortgage market in the week that followed. Potential buyers stayed home, and mortgage rates didn't move enough to spark refinance demand.Total mortgage application volume dropped 8.9% last week compared with the previous week, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association's seasonally adjusted index. Last week's results included an adjustment for the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday. The average contract interest rate for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages with conforming loan balances, $832,750 or less, decreased to 6.21% from 6.24%, with points increasing to 0.56 from 0.55, including the origination fee, for loans with a 20% down payment. Despite the drop, applications to refinance a home loan fell 5% for the week but were still 117% higher than the same week one year ago, when rates were over 7%. The refinance share of mortgage activity increased to 57.1% of total applications from 56.2% the previous week.Get Property Play directly to your inboxCNBC's Property Play with Diana Olick covers new and evolving opportunities for the real estate investor, delivered weekly to your inbox.Subscribe here to get access today.Applications for a mortgage to purchase a home fell 14% for the week and were just 4% higher year over year.\"Winter Storm Fern likely had an impact as much of the country was snowed in, hampering homebuying activity,\" said Joel Kan, vice president and deputy chief economist at the MBA. \"The annual increase in purchase applications was the weakest since April 2025.Mortgage rates moved higher to start this week, on a separate index from Mortgage News Daily. They are now at the highest level in two weeks, but that's not saying much, as the range is tiny. Rates rose as the result of a stronger-than-expected report on the manufacturing sector.",

    "body": "Workers of Venezuelan state oil company PDVSA operating pumpjack in Lake Maracaibo, in Cabimas, Venezuela, Jan. 27, 2026.Leonardo Fernandez Viloria | ReutersThe Trump administration could issue a general license as soon as this week for companies to produce oil and gas in Venezuela, a person familiar with the plan told CNBC on Tuesday.Chevron is the only U.S. company currently allowed to pump oil in Venezuela under a special license issued by the Treasury Department. Chevron has several joint ventures with state oil company Petróleos de Venezuela, or PDVSA.President Donald Trump is pressuring the oil industry to invest at least $100 billion to repair Venezuela's energy industry after the U.S. captured former President Nicolás Maduro in a raid on Jan. 3. \"The President's team is working around the clock to ensure oil companies are able to make investments in Venezuela's oil infrastructure. Stay tuned,\" White House spokeswoman Taylor Rogers said in a statement. Bloomberg first reported the news. Last week, the Treasury Department issued a general license that allowed U.S. companies to buy, sell, transport and refine Venezuelan crude oil, among other activities. But that license did not include upstream production. Companies were previously barred from these activities under U.S. sanctions. The Venezuelan government last week also passed reforms to ease state control of its oil industry and give more autonomy to private companies. The oil industry's response to investing in Venezuela has been mixed. ExxonMobil CEO Darren Woods told Trump at the White House on Jan. 9 that the country needs big reforms and is \"uninvestable\" under its current system. Exxon has had its assets seized twice by the government in Caracas. Private wildcatters and smaller shale oil companies have shown more enthusiasm about the potential opportunity in the South American nation. Chevron CEO Mike Wirth told CNBC last week that it can ramp up production in Venezuela by 50% in the next 18 to 24 months with approvals from the U.S. It currently produces about 250,000 barrels per day in the South American nation. Venezuela is a founding member of OPEC and is believed to have the largest crude oil reserves in the world. ",

    "body": "Just as Novo Nordisk showed signs of a recovery, another cold shower hit investors as the drugmaker surprise pre-released its 2026 forecast late Tuesday, sending shares tumbling. Novo Nordisk's stock plummeted 17% in Copenhagen early Wednesday, tracking losses seen in its American depositary shares on Tuesday and more than wiping out gains seen so far this year. \"People should expect that it goes down before it comes back up,\" CEO Mike Doustdar told CNBC's \"Early Edition Europe\" on Wednesday, highlighting the headwinds of significantly lower U.S. pricing on its best-selling weight loss drug Wegovy. \"We did not go into the details of the magnitude of that – with the guidance we are giving that range.\"watch nowIt follows Novo's guidance for 2026 sales and operating profit both declining between 5% and 13%, far worse than analysts had expected.Barclays analysts said some might suggest the guide to be a \"kitchen sink\" that will be beaten, \"though we note the same was said last year, and this proved not to be the case.\" In July last year, Novo slashed guidance for 2025, citing a challenging U.S. market, leading to shares to crash 23% on the day.'U-shaped recovery'\"We are creating affordability for the patients, millions of patients that are right now in need of GLP-1 products, but simply could not afford it. To do that short term, you have to take a headwind. But of course, there's a very long tailwind for years to come,\" Doustdar told CNBC. The company has flagged challenges around pricing in its biggest market, the U.S., due to both competition from compounding pharmacies that sell cheaper knockoff versions of semaglutide – the active ingredient in Wegovy and Ozempic – as well as from chief rival U.S.-based Eli Lilly.But optimism grew early this year as the launch of the Wegovy pill in the U.S. went better than even Novo had expected. \"We knew it's going to be the best in terms of efficacy of 16.6% we had expected it to do well, but we did not think that after four weeks of introduction, we will have 170,000 people on the pill,\" said Doustdar.\"No matter how well it does in the initial period, the price hit on the existing business trumps, basically, the great pill launch that we've had.\"While Novo has worked to manage expectations going into its full-year results, where it also announced guidance for the year to come, the market did not see this coming. \"The question becomes if the recovery from here, [will be] a Nike swoosh or U-shaped recovery,\" noted HSBC's Rajesh Kumar.A company in crisis?Last year was a historic one for Novo in more ways than one. Shares fell nearly 50% in 2025, marking the company's worst year on record. The company appointed its first non-Danish CEO as well as naming a former CEO, Lars Rebien Sørensen, as chair of the board in what has been described as an unprecedented power grab. That position added to his existing duties, which include serving as chair of Novo's controlling shareholder, Novo Nordisk Foundation. Novo also inked a landmark deal with U.S. President Donald Trump to lower prices on its blockbuster drugs on Medicare and Medicaid and offer them directly to consumers at a discount on a website the Trump administration is launching called TrumpRx.gov. The new Wegovy pill starting dose is marketed at only $149, a fraction of what Novo sold the injectable version for only a year ago. Patent expiries in some ex-U.S. markets in 2026 will also hit sales. Additionally, Novo's U.S. chief David Moore, who led the launch of the pill, is leaving the company for personal reasons, Novo said. He is replaced by Jamie Miller, formerly with U.S. health insurer UnitedHealth Group.When asked on Wednesday if Novo Nordisk was in crisis, Doustdar decisively answered \"no.\" \"While we acknowledge 2025 presented significant challenges affecting our performance and share price, those adversaries have also made us more resilient,\" he said on a call with journalists.",

Investors have been wondering how much Microsoft and other longstanding software companies can grow as corporate workers build new applications using generative artificial intelligence models. Microsoft shares have slipped 15% so far this year, trailing all other Magnificent Seven technology stocks. Last week Microsoft issued Azure cloud growth that came in below some projections. Executives said they want to allocate more computing resources to research and development teams and to its AI products such as the Microsoft 365 Copilot productivity software add-on and the GitHub Copilot coding assistant, while still meeting Azure client demand.\"Judson expanded the remits of his leadership team to free up more time to focus on Microsoft's commercial product strategy and to keep the feedback loop between customers and product decisions as small as possible,\" a Microsoft spokesperson told CNBC in an email. \"This feedback loop is critical right now because AI is being adopted at extraordinary speed, and our customers expect these capabilities to come to life in their business faster than ever before.\"Deb Cupp, chief revenue officer leading Microsoft's global enterprise sales business, is the company's latest executive vice president, Althoff said in an memo. In recent years, Cupp went from president of Microsoft's U.S. business to president for North America and then to president of the Americas.Nick Parker, chief business officer of worldwide sales and solutions, is becoming an executive vice president as well. He's been at the company since 2000.Ralph Haupter becomes executive vice president and chief revenue officer for small and medium enterprises and channel. Haupter came to Microsoft from IBM in 2005, and he spent four years as CEO and chairman of the Windows and Office company's greater China business.Mala Anand, a former SAP executive who joined Microsoft in 2019, will be executive vice president and chief customer experience officer. The four will continue to report to Althoff, the spokesperson said.Satya Nadella, who was executive vice president before stepping up as Microsoft's CEO since 2014, has concentrated on innovation with Althoff taking on more responsibility. At a software developer event in India in December, he showed off an app he built to research topics using a slew of generative AI models.\"I started my career in a command line, Nadella said on a podcast recorded at the Davos conference in Switzerland in January. \"Who knows?

KKR shares, which lost nearly 10% on Tuesday, gained 0.5% in after hours trading. Global data centers' dealmaking hit a fresh record last year, driven by a rush to build out the infrastructure required for energy-intensive AI workloads, with S&P Global reporting that over $61 billion had flowed into the data center market, up from $60.8 billion last year.\"Digital infrastructure remains one of the most compelling long-term investment themes globally,\" said David Luboff, co-head of KKR Asia Pacific and head of Asia Pacific infrastructure, citing STT GDC's diversified footprint and development pipeline.Citi and the Bank of America are advisors to KKR and Singtel, while J.P. Morgan acted as sole financial advisor to ST Telemedia. The deal marks the largest M&A deal in Singapore in the last four years, data from Citi showed. Founded in 2014 and headquartered in Singapore, STT GDC operates data centers across 12 markets in Asia Pacific, the United Kingdom and Europe, with 2.3 gigawatts of design capacity. The company provides colocation, connectivity and support services to hyperscalers and enterprise customers.KKR and Singtel first invested in ST Telemedia Global Data Centres in June 2024, putting in $1.75 billion Singapore dollars for a minority stake.\"STT GDC's diverse geographical footprint increases our exposure to new markets and makes the Singtel Group a stronger data centre player with global reach,\" said Arthur Lang, group chief financial officer at Singtel.",

Louisa Gouliamaki | ReutersFederal Reserve Governor Stephen Miran has stepped down from his position as chair of the Council of Economic Advisers, CNBC has confirmed.Miran joined the Trump administration's Council of Economic Advisers in January 2025. He had been on leave from this post since September 2025 — when he became a member of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors.Miran was appointed in September to fill the unexpired term of Biden-appointee former Fed Governor Adriana Kugler, who resigned abruptly in August. At the time, Miran said he expected to fill out Kugler's term, which expired Jan. 31, then return to his CEA post. However, he said then that if his time at the Fed extended beyond that date, he would resign from the CEA. President Donald Trump has not formally nominated a successor yet, though he said last week he would put up former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh to ultimately serve as Fed chair. watch now\"In accordance with the pledge he made to the Senate during his confirmation to the Federal Reserve's Board of Governors, Stephen Miran has submitted his resignation from the Council of Economic Advisers,\" White House spokesman Kush Desai said. \"Prior to the start of his Stephen's leave last September, his brilliant insights and powerful advocacy on behalf of the President made him an enormous asset for the White House, and he established himself as a key member of the Trump administration's economic team.\" Since taking the post at the Fed, Miran has argued for aggressive interest rate cuts. He has voted \"no\" at each of the four Federal Open Market Committee meetings he has attended. Central bank policymakers cut their benchmark rate by a quarter-percentage point at three of those meetings; Miran argued for half-point reductions. Most recently, he voted against policymakers' decision to hold rates steady in a range of 3.5% to 3.75% at the January meeting. He wanted to lower rates by a quarter point.In a Friday interview on CNBC's \"Money Movers,\" Miran noted that his seat would be the only vacancy available on the board of governors for Warsh.In a post on social media network X, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., said that Miran's departure came \"141 days too late.\"Barron's first reported on Miran's plan to leave the CEA. ",

    "body": "Sen. Elizabeth Warren speaks, alongside Sen. Ron Wyden, to press in the Capitol, Feb. 3, 2025.Kayla Bartkowski | Getty ImagesSens. Elizabeth Warren, Ron Wyden and Richard Blumenthal called on federal agencies to scrutinize AI deals from Nvidia, Meta and Google for potential antitrust violations, in a letter shared with CNBC. The three Democrats addressed the letter on Wednesday to the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice, urging the agencies to review recent deals in which tech companies have paid to pluck specific employees from startups without acquiring the companies entirely. The senators characterized the deals as \"reverse acqui-hiring.\"These deals \"function as de facto mergers, allowing the companies to consolidate talent, information, and resources, all while apparently attempting to bypass the scrutiny typically applied to mergers and acquisitions,\" the letter reads. The senators wrote that the FTC and DOJ should \"carefully scrutinize these deals and block or reverse them should they violate antitrust law.\" The pressure by the senators could make it more difficult for tech companies to continue pursuing these types of deals. Venture capitalists and experts have previously told CNBC that these deals often leave some investors and employees in a state of limbo while founders and AI leaders get paid handsomely. The senators said these kinds of deals ultimately benefit big tech companies while impeding competition.In the letter, the senators specifically mention Meta's $14.3 billion investment in Scale AI in June to bring in CEO Alexandr Wang to lead the social media company's AI strategy. The letter also references Google's $2.4 billion nonexclusive licensing agreement in July with Windsurf, which brought the search company key leaders from the AI coding startup. The most recent deal included in the letter was Nvidia's $20 billion December deal to buy assets from AI chipmaker Groq and bring in senior leaders. \"These arrangements further consolidate the Big Tech industry, which in turn could cause higher prices and stifle innovation,\" the senators wrote in the letter addressed to Assistant Attorney General Gail Slater and FTC Chairman Andrew Ferguson. \"The FTC and DOJ should not allow these companies to avoid the typical reviews that your agencies apply to acquisitions and mergers.\"The letter follows a statement from Ferguson in January in which he said the FTC would review these kinds of deals to learn whether tech companies are attempting to evade regulatory reviews.WATCH: Nvidia-OpenAI megadeal news is not good for OpenAI.watch now",

    "body": "Chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) dropped 9% in early market premarket trading on Wednesday after its first-quarter forecast fell short of some analyst expectations. AMD reported revenue of $10.27 billion for the fourth quarter that topped LSEG consensus estimates of $9.67 billion on Tuesday. The company said it expects $9.8 billion in revenue for the first quarter, plus or minus $300 million, versus expectations of $9.38 billion. But some analysts had predicted the chipmaker would provide stronger guidance for the first-quarter amid an ongoing boom in spending for the processors needed to power AI. AMD, which alongside Nvidia is one of the key makers of AI chips, has seen its stock surge more than 100% in the past year on the back of rising demand.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconAMD stock over the past year\"First, expectations were pretty sky high,\" said Susquehanna's Chris Rolland, talking on CNBC's \"Closing Bell Overtime.\" \"Secondly, they announced they shipped Chinese revenue in the quarter that was unexpected. This was not in street numbers, so when you account for that, the beat was far less substantial than we would've thought.\"However, he added, demand for AMD's chips in data centers was still strong and the company was hinting at multi-gigawatt contracts to come in the future.The chipmaker inked a deal with OpenAI in October that could see the startup take a 10% stake in AMD. OpenAI will deploy 6 gigawatts of AMD's Instinct graphics processing units over multiple years beginning with an initial 1-gigawatt rollout of chips in the second half of 2026, the companies said. Oracle also announced in October plans to deploy 50,000 of AMD's AI chips beginning later this year. watch now",

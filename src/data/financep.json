    "body": "With 2026 around the corner, many people are eyeing tips and tricks to bring into the new year at home and at work.And while many are considering a new morning or evening routine, there are two other routines you might want to incorporate into your schedule, specifically at work, to better focus when you need to and disconnect at the end of the day, says Cal Newport, a computer science professor at Georgetown University and author of several books on focus and productivity.Newport is a proponent of using time blocking to reserve time during your day for deep work, meaning the tasks that are most cognitively demanding.The first routine Newport recommends is for the run-up to a deep work block.\"Our brain is not wired for sustained concentration on an abstract or symbolic topic,\" Newport says. \"Give your brain time, give it some help shifting over into deep work mode because it's a very unnatural thing you're asking your brain to do.\"Many workers are constantly bombarded with notifications throughout their day. A Microsoft report from April found that employees are interrupted every 2 minutes by emails, meetings or pings. The brain is in a very different state managing all of that digital noise than when you're zeroed in on deep work, so it takes to switch between these modes.Before a deep work block on your calendar, you might take a quick walk around the block, make tea, or clean your desk — something you can repeat and use as a signal to your brain it's time to switch modes. Think of it like stretching before you go on a run.\"You can't just shut down your inbox, open Microsoft Word and think, 'Now I'm focused,'\" Newport says.At the end of your workday, you also need a shutdown routine.\"It's a way of clearing out your brain after work so it's not going to be held partially hostage by work thoughts for your time outside of work,\" Newport says.His shutdown routine as he signs off at the end of his workday includes doing a final inbox check, looking ahead on his work calendar and writing down any reminders.At the end of it, you should feel, \"We're in a good place, there's nothing else I need to figure out tonight, we're on track for the things we need to get done.\" Then, you should have \"some sort of visible shutdown statement or routine to indicate you've finished.\" Newport, for example, checks off a box that says \"Shutdown complete\" as the last step.A shutdown routine won't magically put an end to your work anxiety, but it can \"help teach your brain to slow down work ruminations.\"\"Instead of engaging with the ruminations, you say I checked that checkbox and I wouldn't have done that if I hadn't gone through everything and convinced myself we're in a good position to shut down for the day,\" Newport says.\"It prevents you from the temptation of maybe I should just go check my inbox,\" he adds. \"It helps you move on from work in a way that eventually your brain learns so you can get more out of your life outside work.\"Want to give your kids the ultimate advantage?

    "body": "This is the season when everyone's planning for next year. When it comes to money, I can assure you that the secret isn't in some fancy investing tactic, hot stock tip, or obscure cryptocurrency. If you and your partner set just one money resolution for 2026, make it this: You both stay actively involved in your finances.As a financial advisor for more than 20 years who's operated my own wealth management firm for nine, I know that this is the single most impactful commitment most couples can make. Yet it's missing in so many relationships. The dangers of disconnecting Leaving the money to be handled by one spouse leaves your family vulnerable. If something happens to the person handling everything (illness, death, or even divorce), the other is left to scramble. I've helped heartbroken spouses try to piece together accounts, passwords, and plans during the worst moments imaginable, and I wouldn't wish this outcome upon anyone. But even in less dramatic circumstances, it's still ineffective to leave one overwhelmed person to make all the decisions. You miss out on the power of two perspectives, and the disengaged spouse loses their agency and confidence. I've sat across from countless couples who, even with the best intentions, have lost the plot over time. Most of them never addressed the subtle shifts in their dynamic that made it easier for one partner to take the lead with their money. I'd often end up with just one client at our financial planning meetings, and their partner, I was told, was too busy, disinterested, apprehensive, or overwhelmed to join us. For a long time, I didn't understand why, until it happened in my own home. 'This isn't working anymore'During the pandemic, my wife, Heather, was juggling too much: lawyering in the general counsel's office of a Fortune 100 company, moonlighting as my business consultant for my wealth management firm, and keeping me and our two daughters clothed, fed, entertained, and safe. As a result of the physical, mental, and emotional labor she was carrying for all of us, she disconnected from our household finances. Money felt like the one thing she didn't have to worry about. In truth, it was the one thing I was willing to own from start to finish, and it was damaging to our relationship. I'm grateful she had the courage to say, \"This isn't working anymore.\" The tough conversations that followed caused us to rethink what we wanted out of our careers, how we divided labor, and how we could approach money as a team again. Make yourselves a money teamTalking about money is never just about money, which inspired Heather and me to spend two years interviewing other couples for our new book, \"Money Together: How to Find Fairness in Your Relationship and Become an Unstoppable Financial Team.\" Effective communication is the bedrock. Here are some ways to connect with intention, move beyond the numbers, and engage in your finances together — even when it's the harder thing to do.Start with an honest review. Schedule a distraction-free time and place to get into everything. Do you both have access to your accounts? Are all passwords saved in your password managers? You should both have a baseline understanding of your net worth. Review what you earn (cash flow), what you have (assets and investments), what you owe (debt), and what you want (goals). Examine time, from each of your perspectives. Ask whether each of you feels you have the time to do what you want and need to do. You may need to shuffle responsibilities and automate or outsource less-critical tasks to free up time for finances. Create a regular practice. Make recurring money dates non-negotiable. We suggest having them quarterly, which won't become overwhelming and will create enough space between meetings to recognize real progress.  Meet your partner where they are. I've often encountered couples where one partner has less knowledge or comfort with all things finances than the other, and that, in part, is why they've disengaged. It can feel daunting. Tailor your approach to your partner's learning style, checking in to see what resonates.Bring in outside help if needed. A neutral financial advisor or therapist who specializes in money dynamics can guide tough conversations without bias, and offer financial advice that's tailored to your specific situation. When Heather and I finally reconnected around money, it secured our wallets and also deepened our relationship. Make 2026 the year you prioritize staying connected to your finances together — I know from experience just how transformative it can be. Douglas A.

    "body": "A 2025 poll from the C.S. Mott Children's Hospital at the University of Michigan asked American parents of children ages one to 18 about their views on various child health topics including bullying, internet safety, lack of physical activity, parental stress and diet.The Mott poll report, released in August, found that a majority of parents surveyed, 69%, think the physical health of American children and teens is getting worse. And even more parents are worried about their kids' emotional wellbeing: 83% believe the mental health of U.S. children and teens is also on the decline.Results of the poll also show that parents believe social media, too much screen time, and internet safety to be some of the top concerns kids are facing today.\"Since the increased use of social media starting around 2010, the prevalence of mental health problems in youth has also increased significantly,\" according to the report. \"This increase, particularly in depression, anxiety and suicidal thoughts continued through the COVID-19 pandemic years.\"Jonathan Haidt, social scientist and author of \"The Anxious Generation,\" is one of the many experts sounding an alarm about the connection between increased anxiety and depression among young people and smartphones and social media.\"All these devices are designed to keep kids scrolling for hours and hours,\" he previously told CNBC Make It. \"The average screen time is eight to 10 hours, not including school.\" \"We have to roll that back if we want any hope for them to grow up healthy,\" he said.Haidt encourages parents to be more intentional about reducing their child's use of devices and social media. Here, he and Jean Twenge, a psychology professor and author of \"10 Rules for Raising Kids in a High-Tech World,\" offer up some recommendations for how parents can work to get that done.No smartphones before high schoolHaidt argues for a clear boundary: Kids should not get a smartphone before they reach high school. A global study of 27,969 18-to-24-year-olds by nonprofit Sapien Labs found that mental wellbeing improved the older the age of first ownership of a smartphone. Haidt also recommends parents refrain from enabling the use of social media on kids' phones before the age of 16.When kids get their devices, Haidt suggests parents have a designated place for them.\"They live on the kitchen counter,\" Haidt said as an example. \"If you need it, you check it out.\"No screens in the bedroom overnight Twenge advocates for keeping screens out of the bedroom overnight.\"That's just a situation where there's, kind of, no argument: 'You do not need that phone in your bedroom when you are supposed to be sleeping. Period. End of story. Mic drop. We're done,'\" Twenge previously told CNBC Make It.Devices in the bedroom can disrupt children's sleep, whether they're up late scrolling or their notifications are waking them up. \"Not getting enough sleep is a risk factor for just about everything we'd like our kids to avoid, from getting sick to feeling depressed,\" Twenge wrote in her book \"10 Rules for Raising Kids in a High-Tech World.\"Haidt would go a step further: no screens in the bedroom whatsoever, he said.More free play outside To ensure kids don't get too sucked into their devices, Haidt also recommends parents encourage them to spend time outside with friends.Communities can decide to enact what he calls \"free play Fridays.\"\"Everyone knows that's when kids get together at the park, they play baseball, football, whatever,\" he previously told Make It. \"Maybe they just stay at the school playground.\"Ultimately, playing with friends and without screens is \"the most fun kids can have,\" he said. They might have so much, they'll ask to continue spending time with their friends over the weekend. Want to give your kids the ultimate advantage?

    "body": "As middle management jobs shrink, workplace experts say executives may be underestimating just how crucial these roles are to their companies — especially in the age of AI.The ranks of middle managers, the professionals that bridge senior leaders with frontline employees, have been thinning in recent years. Middle managers made up one-third of all layoffs in 2023, a Bloomberg and Live Data Technologies analysis found. This year, 41% of employees say their companies trimmed down their management layers, according to organizational consulting firm Korn Ferry's Workforce 2025: Power Shifts report, which surveyed 15,000 professionals worldwide. The trend is expected to continue into 2026: One in five (20%) businesses are expected to use AI to flatten their organizational structure, slashing over half of current middle management positions, an October 2024 report from research and advisory firm Gartner found. The layoffs span from major public companies like Amazon and Google to smaller businesses in the U.S., particularly in industries like tech and retail. Some of these companies say they're rectifying pandemic-era over-hiring. Others say they've laid off middle managers as they seek faster, more efficient workflows, and still others cite downsizing due to economic pressures, according to a recent Harris Poll survey on behalf of staffing agency Express Employment Professionals. And while the timing may be coincidental, the tightening comes as some CEOs mandate using artificial intelligence to accomplish work tasks before requesting more headcount.While there can be some upsides to trimming layers of ineffective management, leadership and management experts warn against cutting too deep. They say these positions are a necessary puzzle piece for a successful workplace.\"Middle managers are more important than ever,\" says Deborah Lovich, a C-suite advisor and senior partner at Boston Consulting Group who has counseled leaders on how to improve the employee experience for over 30 years. In today's rapidly changing and uncertain economy where employees are experiencing increased burnout and dissatisfaction and lower confidence, Lovich says middle managers are the ones who can give them the motivation and reassurance they need to be productive. Well-equipped managers aren't just an 'expense'Amid higher inflation, tariffs and economic concerns, many companies are tightening their belts. Middle managers, who typically have higher salaries, can often be the first target in leaner times.To be sure, there can be benefits to thinning out excessive layers of hierarchy.Cutting back on middle managers can help businesses reduce costs, encourage more collaboration between frontline employees and senior executives, and increase a company's overall speed and efficiency, according to a 2020 report from management consulting firm McKinsey & Company.That doesn't mean middle management roles should be eliminated altogether or indiscriminately, says Megg Withinton, vice president of enterprise analytics at HR solutions company Insperity. Instead, she says, these professionals should be better equipped to do their jobs. A competent middle manager builds motivation and productivity for their team and plays a significant role in company culture, says Lovich.In contrast, ineffective middle managers — whether due to inexperience, poor job fit, vague guidance from their own bosses or another reason — can weaken performance and morale. Only 51% of newer managers with less than three years of experience feel completely prepared to lead others, according to Insperity's data. And only 20% of employees say their managers exceed their expectations, according to a recent Insperity survey of 1,000 U.S. executives, managers and frontline employees.One potential solution, suggests Withinton: Companies could invest in management training and upskilling, rather than using layoffs as a short-term fix. Upskilling isn't free, of course. But spending about $1,000 per employee to train and develop your talent may have better long-term outcomes, Withinton says, considering turnover costs and lost employee trust and morale — especially for companies that eventually rehire after layoffs anyway. Besides, effective management is about more than money, says Withinton. Some workers find that their work is more difficult when their immediate manager is cut. In Korn Ferry's report, 37% of survey respondents said that not having that middle management role left them feeling directionless.\"I would really encourage people to think about managers not as an expense or an administrative or bureaucratic layer, but an agent for change,\" she says. As organizations rethink their strategies and workflow to be more AI-forward, managers can help guide their teams to use the technology effectively, instead of fear it. \"[Especially] in a time where things are changing week to week, and we're all just going to be scrambling to keep up for a while as this new [AI-driven] world unfolds.\"How to use managers to their full potentialManagers provide the most value when they're keeping their teams accountable and helping workers feel motivated and supported, says Lovich — not necessarily when they're handling administrative tasks like coordinating meetings or tracking employees.The emotional element of management is particularly important in the age of AI, she notes. The tech can and should be used to augment managers' abilities to complete administrative tasks, but can't authentically congratulate an employee on a job well done or notice that they're a little down and not themselves on a given day, Lovich says.Manager training should emphasize skills like fostering interpersonal relationships, effective communication, decision making and accountability, conflict resolution and building trust within teams, according to Insperity performance consultant Chris Brennan.Organizations that use their managers to their full potential reap significant benefits, Insperity's survey found: Their employees are five times more likely to report a healthy workplace culture and four times more likely to understand and align with company goals. What's more, companies with high-performing managers tend to yield higher shareholder returns than their counterparts, according to a June 2023 report from McKinsey and Company. Those advantages will be especially important as organizations start to integrate artificial intelligence into their workflows, Withinton says.\"Before we all leap to 'AI is going to make the role of manager either obsolete or much more reduced,' you actually have to deploy AI and make it work for your company,\" Withinton says. \"And the managers are the people who are going to be able to really make sure that it's being used in the appropriate way day to day. There is no other way around that.\"Still, a looming question remains: By helping facilitate the transition to AI, are today's managers positioning themselves to be increasingly obsolete tomorrow?

Alexander Kazakov | Afp | Getty ImagesRussia and Ukraine continued to trade barbs Tuesday over an alleged drone attack on one of Russian President Vladimir Putin's official residences.Ukraine has denied it carried out any such strike, describing it as a \"complete fabrication,\" but the Kremlin said that its military stands ready to retaliate. Russia's Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov on Monday alleged that Ukraine had fired 91 drones at Putin's official residence in the Novgorod region, located between Moscow and St Petersburg.Lavrov said the drones, allegedly launched between Sunday night and Monday morning, had been destroyed by air defenses and that no casualties had been reported. It's not clear where Putin was at the time of the alleged incident, and Lavrov provided no further details. Ukraine denied the claims and instead accused Moscow of trying to undermine peace talks.\"Russia is at it again, using dangerous statements to undermine all achievements of our shared diplomatic efforts with President Trump's team,\" Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said on X. \"This alleged \"residence strike\" story is a complete fabrication intended to justify additional attacks against Ukraine, including Kyiv, as well as Russia's own refusal to take necessary steps to end the war. Typical Russian lies.\"Russian state media reported that Putin called U.S. President Donald Trump following the incident and told him that Russia would \"revise its stance\" in ongoing peace talks aimed at ending the war in Ukraine. Russia's allegation came a day after Zelenskyy held in-person talks with Trump in Mar-a-Lago in Florida, with both leaders saying progress had been made on a 20-point peace plan and an agreement on security guarantees for Ukraine. Zelenskyy commented Monday that Moscow was trying to undermine peace talks between the U.S. and Kyiv, saying: \"Ukraine does not take steps that can undermine diplomacy. To the contrary, Russia always takes such steps. This is one of many differences between us.\"On Tuesday, the Kremlin said it had noted Zelenskyy's denial and said the Western media was \"playing along with Ukraine.\" Asked whether Russia would produce evidence for the alleged drone attack, Putin's Press Secretary Dmitry Peskov said that was a matter for the military.Ukraine's Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha commented on X Tuesday that \"almost a day passed and Russia still hasn't provided any plausible evidence to its accusations of Ukraine's alleged \"attack on Putin's residence.\" And they won't. Because there's none. No such attack happened.\"Trump reactionRussian state media reported that Trump had expressed outrage at the alleged attack during a phone conversation with Putin on Monday. Kremlin Presidential Aide Yuri Ushakov told the press that Trump was \"shocked by this information, literally outraged\" at \"such reckless actions,\" state media agency TASS reported. Ushakov added that it was stated that the incident would affect the U.S. approach to working with Zelenskyy.Trump was later directly asked for his reaction to the alleged drone attack and appeared to side with Russia's version of events.\"I learned about it from ‌President Putin today. I was very angry about ‌it,\" he told reporters in Florida Monday.\"This is not ​the right time. It's one thing to be offensive, because they're offensive. ‍It's another thing to attack his house. It's not the right time to do any of that,\" he added.U.S. President Donald Trump welcomes Russian President Vladimir Putin to Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson on August 15, 2025 in Anchorage, Alaska. Contributor | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesSome commentators on social media said that Russia had aimed to use the alleged drone attack as a way to gauge Trump's attitude toward Ukraine, and to undermine — or stress test — potential security guarantees that Kyiv could receive as part of a peace deal.\"This is how supposedly ironclad 'security guarantees for Ukraine' would fall apart: one Russian false-flag operation — or just a lie ... and they're gone,\" Olena Halushka, co-founder of the International Centre for Ukrainian Victory, commented on X.When asked if there was any U.S. intelligence showing the attack actually took place, Trump admitted it's \"possible\" it didn't actually happen. But he added: \"President Putin told me this morning it did.\"",

    "body": "Copper anodes come out of a furnace at the Glencore Canadian Copper Refinery (CCR) in Montreal, Quebec, Canada on Tuesday, Aug. 12, 2025.Bloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesCopper is on track for its biggest annual price rise in more than a decade, driven by supply disruptions, a weakening U.S. dollar, improving expectations for Chinese economic growth — and blockbuster spending on artificial intelligence.Analysts say the red metal's rally could continue next year, particularly amid supply fears and a rapidly expanding global data center footprint.Three-month copper prices on the London Metal Exchange (LME) traded up 1.5% at $12,405 per metric ton on Tuesday, paring recent gains after notching a record high of $12,960 in the previous session.The benchmark contract, which is up around 41% this year, is on pace for its best year since 2009, when it gained over 140% as countries emerged from the global financial crisis. In New York, copper prices have soared more than 40% since the start of 2025, also putting it on track for its biggest annual jump since 2009, when the contract rose 137.3%. Demand for copper is widely considered a proxy for economic health. The base metal is critically important to the energy transition ecosystem and is integral to the manufacturing of electric vehicles, power grids, and wind turbines.Indeed, electrification, grid expansion, and data-center buildouts all require large amounts of copper for wiring, power transmission, and cooling infrastructure. watch nowIan Roper, commodity strategist at Astris Advisory Japan KK, singled out a global boom in AI demand as the latest driver for copper prices, with \"very tight\" markets likely to mean the red metal could rally even further next year.\"The story for copper of the last few years has been green energy, right? Even though China has had a huge property downturn [and] that's hit things like steel demand, iron ore prices, it's not really affected copper so much,\" Roper told CNBC's Dan Murphy on Dec. 23.\"Copper has been a big beneficiary of the buildout of renewable energy, EVs, and now, of course, data centers is the big growth story,\" he added. AI and defenseAnalysts at JPMorgan said in a research note published in late November that LME copper prices could have further room to run next year, predicting an average of $12,500 per metric ton in the second quarter.The Wall Street bank said it expects copper to average $12,075 through 2026, citing data center demand growth as an \"extremely topical\" upside risk.\"All in all, we think these unique dynamics of disjointed inventory and acute supply disruptions tightening the copper market add up to a bullish set up for copper, and are enough to push prices above $12,000/mt in the first half of 2026,\" Gregory Shearer, head of base and precious metals strategy at JPMorgan, said in the note.  Coils, coiled copper wires, lie on pallets in the wire plant (coiler) at Aurubis AG. After a casting and rolling process, hot copper wire is wound through the coiler into a coil weighing up to five tons and measuring around twelve kilometers in length.Picture Alliance | Picture Alliance | Getty ImagesNot everyone is as bullish on the copper price outlook, however.  Analysts at Goldman Sachs Research expect copper prices to decline from their recent record highs, even as growing demand for the metal gradually pushes up prices in the longer term.  In a research note published on Dec. 11, analysts at Goldman Sachs Research said LME copper prices were poised to remain in a range of $10,000 to $11,000 as robust global demand growth from the grid and power infrastructure sector, \"backed by investment in strategic sectors such as AI and defence,\" keeps prices from dipping below $10,000.The analysts said they expect LME copper prices to average $10,710 in the first half of 2026. Looking much further ahead, they projected LME copper prices to climb to $15,000 in 2035, noting that this is above the consensus of industry analysts.",

(photo by Andrew Aitchison / In pictures via Getty Images)Andrew Aitchison | In Pictures | Getty ImagesBritish renewable energy startup Octopus Energy is set to spin out its AI tech unit Kraken Technologies, setting the stage for a potential public listing.Origin Energy, which holds a major stake in Octopus, said in a statement late on Monday that Octopus had raised $1 billion in its first standalone funding round, valuing the business at $8.65 billion. The funding round paves the way for the spinoff, with Octopus targeting a separation by mid-2026, Origin said.The statement said \"a major Kraken customer,\" which it did not name, and Daniel Sundheim's hedge fund D1 Capital Partners were involved in the investment round. Origin will also invest $140 million as part of the process. \"In signing this major new customer, Kraken is rapidly closing in on its 100 million customer account target well ahead of plan,\" said Origin CEO Frank Calabria.Octopus Energy will retain a 13.7% stake in Kraken following the spin-out, while Origin's interest in Kraken remains at 22.7%.\"We believe these transactions put Octopus and Kraken in a strong position to unlock their next phase of growth, underpinned by the appropriate capital structure,\" Calabria added.Kraken supplies energy software to utility companies, including EDF and E.ON. Its contracted annual recurring revenue more than doubled in the last 18 months, according to Origin Energy.Earlier this year, Kraken CEO Amir Orad told CNBC's \"Squawk Box Europe\" that the company has a \"very strong investor base\" that focuses on energy and utilities. watch nowKraken has benefited from being owned by Octopus, as a growing number of energy companies licensed its technology, turning the company into what Orad described as \"the modern operating system for utilities.\"When asked about a public listing in September, Orad told CNBC that the \"opportunity is significant,\" but that Kraken needed to focus on being a pure software company.\"With that, we expect, over time, to get more pure software long-term, late-stage investors. Today, we have a very strong investor base that focuses on energy and on utilities. Over the years... we expect that to evolve to be more software focused, given the [separation],'\" he said.— CNBC's Domi Suskova contributed to this report.",

    "body": "The logo of Meta is seen at the Viva Technology conference dedicated to innovation and startups at Porte de Versailles exhibition center in Paris, France, on June 11, 2025.Gonzalo Fuentes | ReutersMeta Platforms said Tuesday that it has acquired Manus, a Singapore-based developer of general-purpose AI agents, as the tech giant continues its massive investments into artificial intelligence. Manus, founded in China before relocating to Singapore, launched its first general AI agent earlier this year, which can execute complex tasks such as market research, coding, and data analysis. The company claimed it had achieved an annualized average revenue of more than $100 million just eight months after launch, while its revenue run rate exceeded $125 million.Meta said in a statement that its acquisition was aimed at accelerating AI innovation for businesses and integrating advanced automation into its consumer and enterprise products, including its Meta AI assistant.\"Manus is already serving the daily needs of millions of users and businesses worldwide ... We plan to scale this service to many more businesses,\" Meta said.According to the firms, Manus will continue operating its subscription service without disruption. While further terms of the acquisition were not disclosed, the Wall Street Journal reported that the deal closed at an amount over $2 billion, according to sources familiar with the acquisition. The start-up was seeking a fresh round of fundraising at a $2 billion valuation when it was approached by Meta, the report added.Manus began as a product of Chinese start-up Butterfly Effect, also known as Monica.Im, before growing into a separate entity. It emerged as a notable AI player earlier this year after claiming its chatbot offered superior performance to OpenAI's Deep Research agent.The company raised $75 million in a Series B funding round led by U.S. venture firm Benchmark in April, and is backed by Tencent and private equity firm HongShan Capital Group (HSG), formerly known as Sequoia, according to data from market research firm Tracxn.The start-up reportedly laid off most of its staff in Beijing in July before moving its headquarters to Singapore in June as it looked towards global expansion.\"Joining Meta allows us to build on a stronger, more sustainable foundation without changing how Manus works or how decisions are made,\" Xiao Hong, CEO of Manus, said in a company release. The firm also announced a strategic partnership with Alibaba's Qwen AI team in March, highlighting its existing ties to Chinese tech companies.Aggressive AI expansionMeta's acquisition of Manus fits into its broader AI strategy of scooping up specialized AI start-ups to acquire talent and fast-track its broader AI business, including the development of its open-source Llama large language models.In June, for example, Meta invested $14.3 billion in AI start-up Scale AI, in a deal that brought its founder and CEO, Alexandr Wang, onto Meta's AI leadership team.Meanwhile, Meta acquired AI-wearables start-up Limitless earlier this month as the company looks to grow its AI device business.In the case of Manus, the firm's AI agent tools have drawn interest from major tech companies. In October, Microsoft began testing Manus in Windows 11 PCs, allowing users to create websites from local files. To date, Manus claimed to have processed more than 147 trillion \"tokens\" of text and data, and supported over 80 million virtual computers. It offers both free and paid subscription tiers.Meta said Manus employees will join its teams as the company continues to aggressively poach AI talent from start-ups and major rivals, including OpenAI and Google. ",

    "body": "President Donald Trump speaks to the media next to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu upon arrival for meetings at Trump's Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Florida, Dec. 29, 2025.Jonathan Ernst | ReutersPresident Donald Trump on Monday appeared open to additional military action against Iran if the country attempts to build up its reserves of ballistic weapons and reestablish its nuclear program. However, he urged the country to negotiate.\"Now, I hear that Iran is trying to build up again, and if they are we're going to have to knock them down. We'll knock them down. We'll knock the hell out of them. But hopefully that's not happening,\" Trump said, standing beside Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\"I heard Iran wants to make a deal. If they want to make a deal that's much smarter,\" the president continued.Trump gaggled with reporters at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida ahead of a meeting there with Netanyahu, which comes at a fraught time for the Middle East and amid heightened tensions between Israel and Iran. NBC News reported earlier this month that Netanyahu and Israeli officials were becoming more concerned that Iran was attempting to ramp up its ballistic missile production — which had been damaged earlier this year by Israeli strikes — and reconstitute the nuclear enrichment sites the U.S. bombed in June.\"If they will continue with the missiles, yes. The nuclear, fast,\" Trump said when asked if he would support Israeli strikes on Iran. \"One will be yes, absolutely, and the other we will do it immediately.\"Read more CNBC politics coverageEuropean Union approves over $105 billion toward Ukraine aid package for next two yearsBrown and MIT prof shooter suspect Neves Valente is found dead, authorities saysTrump Media to merge with fusion company TAE Technologies, DJT stock soarsTrump announces 'warrior dividend' of $1,776 to U.S. soldiers in prime-time speechEpstein accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell petitions to vacate sex crime convictionCongressional stock trading ban bill to get a vote in new year: House RepublicansFBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino is stepping down in JanuaryObamacare subsidies extension to get vote after 4 Republicans buck leadershipFCC chief Carr tells Senate that his agency is 'not formally ... independent'Trump vowed to block tankers carrying Venezuela's oil — nearly a dozen at sea nowKennedy Center to be renamed 'Trump-Kennedy Center,' White House saysTrump vowed to block tankers carrying Venezuela's oil — nearly a dozen at sea nowHouse passes bill to ease permits for building out AI infrastructureTrump sues BBC for $10 billion, claims defamation from Panorama documentaryPentagon takes big stake in new Korea Zinc refinery in Tenn., gets 10% of companyNew Trump tariffs collection hits $200 billion, Customs saysFormer Instacart employee says she was fired over her Democratic congressional campaignUkraine peace talks progressing, Russia open to EU membership, U.S. officials sayNew York AG sues UPS for allegedly shorting Christmas season workers' wagesTrump admin to hire 1,000 specialists for 'Tech Force'Trump doubles down on Rob Reiner criticism after killing; director's son in custodyTSA is giving airline passenger data to ICE for deportation push: NYTTrump's AI order may be 'illegal,' Democrats and consumer advocacy groups claimTrump sued by preservation group seeking to halt White House ballroom projectTrump says 'no big deal' after new Epstein photos showing him releasedPutin can fund war for years, ex-official says as Trump's resolve is testedIndiana redistricting bill that Trump demanded defeated in state SenateHouse passes INVEST Act to ease investment standards, boost capital in marketsDOJ fails again to indict New York AG James, a Trump target: ReportsTrump 'sells out' U.S. national security with Nvidia chip sales to China: WarrenTrump pushes for top prosecutor nominee Halligan after Comey, James cases tossedTrump willing to seize more oil tankers off Venezuela coast: White HouseSeized tanker will go to U.S. port, Trump admin intends 'to seize the oil'GOP lawmakers seek Trump aid for agricultural equipment after tariff pressureTrump says Fed could have 'at least doubled' latest interest rate cut'Spoof' ship: Seized oil tanker hid location, visited Iran and VenezuelaTrump admin touts pulling 9,500 truckers off road for failing English testsSwiss government says new 15% U.S. tariff ceiling retroactive to mid-NovemberHomeland Security Dept. buying Boeing 737s for ICE deportationsTrump officials move to end student loan payment pause for millions of borrowersJudge unseals Ghislaine Maxwell grand jury materials, citing Epstein files actUkraine at 'critical moment' in war as European allies ramp up pressure on RussiaDemocrats establish AI working group as industry bolsters DC presenceEx-Trump lawyer Habba resigns as NJ U.S. attorney after disqualificationGaza was also expected to be discussed by the two world leaders on Monday, Trump said, as the White House seeks to advance a ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas. The first phase of the agreement took effect in October and has mostly held. But a second phase — which would call on Hamas to disarm and require Israeli military forces to withdraw — has proven more challenging. Netanyahu has said the second phase cannot begin until Hamas returns the remains of the final deceased Israeli hostage. Trump said on Monday that he hopes to proceed to the second phase \"as quickly as we can. But there has to be a disarmament ... we have to disarm with Hamas.\"Foreign policy in focusForeign policy has dominated Trump's schedule of late. On Sunday, he hosted Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at Mar-a-Lago. The Trump administration is facilitating negotiations between Ukraine and Russia to try to bring an end to the multiyear conflict between the two nations. During the meeting, Zelenskyy reportedly had asked the U.S. for security guarantees for up to 50 years for Ukraine, though the current 20-point peace plan outlined guarantees for 15 years.Trump also said he had a \"very productive\" call with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Monday, though he said a few \"thorny issues\" stand in the way of ending the war.\"We have a couple of issues that we're going to get resolved, hopefully, and if we get it resolved, you're going to have peace,\" Trump said.In the short, wide-ranging press conference on Monday, Trump offered updates on his monthslong pressure campaign against Venezuela.The president confirmed a U.S. strike on a drug loading facility in Venezuela, marking an escalation in his campaign against Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro. \"There was a major explosion in the dock area where they load the boats up with drugs .... So we hit all the boats, and now we hit the area,\" Trump said. \"It's the implementation area, that's where they implement, and that is no longer around.\"Trump has recently designated the Venezuelan government a \"foreign terrorist organization,\" ordered a complete blockade on sanctioned oil tankers moving in and out of the country and has been targeting alleged Venezuelan drug boats.",

    "body": "This summer, Switch 2 became the fastest-selling console in Nintendo's history, selling 10.36 million units in the first four months of salesGuillaume Payen | Sopa Images | Lightrocket | Getty ImagesIt has been a monumental year for the video game industry, marked by new devices and billion-dollar deals.Further consolidation occurred within the sector when a consortium led by the Public Investment Fund of Saudi Arabia, alongside Jared Kushner's Affinity Partners and Silver Lake, announced plans to take Electronic Arts private. The $55 billion deal, which includes $20 billion in debt financing, is the largest leveraged buyout in Wall Street history.The move could have major implications for EA, according to Omdia analysts. They said the question now is whether the PIF plans to run EA as a \"PR project\" or \"to extract maximum returns\" from the company. French game developer Ubisoft looked to turn its fortunes around this year, although it started 2025 with a second delay to the latest entry in its flagship Assassin's Creed series, Shadows.Ubisoft's shares received a boost in March after announcing the creation of a new gaming subsidiary with Chinese tech giant Tencent called Vantage Studios. The new developer, which will be part-owned by Tencent, will focus on Ubisoft's key IP — Far Cry, Assassin's Creed, and Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six.watch nowDespite Ubisoft's efforts, shares have lost just over half of their value year to date, and the stock is down over 90% from its 2021 high.In contrast, Take-Two Interactive's shares continued to climb throughout 2025, as anticipation mounted for the next Grand Theft Auto title. It's been 12 years since the previous edition, GTA 5, was released on Xbox 360 and PS3.However, with radio silence on GTA 6 for most of the year, fans speculated that an additional delay from the May 26, 2026, release date was on the cards, despite Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick telling CNBC in May that he had a \"very, very high conviction\" the scheduled date would be achievable. In November this year, the game was pushed back to Nov. 19, 2026, with shares in Take-Two tumbling on the news.The game will launch in the twilight window for Sony's PlayStation 5 and Microsoft's Xbox Series X and S — six years after both consoles were released. As focus shifts to the next generation of consoles, this past generation has seen a change in strategy for both brands. Console strategies shiftXbox has moved away from exclusive games, with titles such as Indiana Jones, Forza Horizon, and more releasing on PS5, while PlayStation continues to experiment further with releasing titles on PC. Take-Two's Zelnick argued that the shifting strategies will see the video game industry become more open. When asked whether the console will be in business within the next five to 10 years, he said the consoles will still be around, with the devices moving towards PC as \"business is moving towards open rather than closed.\"\"But if you define console as the property, not the system, then the notion of a very rich game that you engage in for many hours, that you play on a big screen, that's never going away,\" he told CNBC's Andrew Ross Sorkin in November.Consoles still have a huge role to play in the market, according to George Jijiashvili, senior principal analyst for Games at Omdia. He told CNBC's \"Squawk Box Europe\" that the devices are still \"the go-to place for premium games.\"Data from Omdia shows that consoles are the second-largest category when it comes to total consumer spend, with mobile spend contributing 60%, consoles reaching 23%, and PCs hitting 16%. While others mostly abandoned exclusive titles, Nintendo has continued to pursue the strategy, releasing several exclusive titles for its new Switch 2 console – including an open-world reimaging of Mario Kart and a brand-new Donkey Kong game. This summer, Switch 2 became the fastest-selling console in history, selling 10.36 million units in the first four months of sales.Not all are convinced by Nintendo's strategy. Christopher Dring, founder and editor-in-chief of The Game Business, told CNBC's \"Built for Billions\" in November that Nintendo faces a challenge in maintaining demand for its systems.\"Unlike PlayStation and Xbox and other platforms, the people buying Nintendo machines are buying it for Nintendo games. What that means is, if they don't have a game ready, they can not rely on other developers to prop them up.\"",

    "body": "Businesswoman working on laptop in modern office spaceMomo Productions | Digitalvision | Getty ImagesStudent debt has long been considered difficult, if not impossible, to discharge in bankruptcy. But that hasn't been the case in recent years, a new study finds. The success rate for student loan borrowers who attempt to discharge their debt in bankruptcy has \"jumped\" to 87%, according to an analysis published in The American Bankruptcy Law Journal this month by Jason Iuliano, a professor at the University of Utah's S.J. Quinney College of Law. In 2017, the success rate for education debt holders in bankruptcy was 61%, and in 2007, it was 40%, Iuliano found. \"People who file for discharge are winning at very high rates,\" Iuliano told CNBC. His study used a final dataset of 652 bankruptcy discharge cases from October 2022 to November 2023 that included student loans.

What you can expectHere's the inflation breakdown for November 2025 — in one chartCNBC's Financial Advisor 100: Best financial advisors, top firms rankedThe improved outcomes for student loan borrowers in bankruptcy stem, in large part, from updated bankruptcy guidelines the Biden administration issued. In November 2022, the U.S. Department of Education and the Department of Justice rolled out a policy that experts say treats student loans more like other types of debt in bankruptcy court. Borrowers can fill out a 15-page attestation form, detailing their financial struggles and making their case for a mulligan. The Trump administration has not rescinded that guidance. An Education Department spokesperson told CNBC the agency has no current plans to change the approach.More than 42 million Americans hold student loans, and the outstanding debt exceeds $1.6 trillion, government data shows.Easier process is 'life-changing' for someAmid concerns that young people would try to avoid their financial obligations, policymakers began passing laws in the mid-1970s that raised the bar for discharging student debt in court. Government attorneys battled the cases, and some people needed to prove a \"certainty of hopelessness\" and \"undue hardship.\" Malissa Giles, a bankruptcy attorney in Virginia, said the easier bankruptcy process has been \"life-changing\" for her clients, many of whom have carried their student debt for decades. \"It allows them to sleep at night,\" she said. Women made up 73% of the student loan bankruptcy filers in the cases Iuliano reviewed. The average student loan balance for the filers was $115,000, but 10% of the borrowers owed more than $240,000. The debtors ranged in age from 24 to 76. Student debt not dischargeable is a 'myth' While the odds for student loan borrowers in bankruptcy have slowly improved, many people still don't bother to file the separate lawsuit required for the discharge of student debt, called an adversary proceeding, Iuliano found. More than 3 million student loan borrowers filed for bankruptcy between 2011 and 2024. But only 7,293 of those individuals took the additional step of requesting a student loan discharge, he writes in his study. \"The myth that student loans are never dischargeable in bankruptcy is so pervasive that many attorneys never even raise the possibility with their clients,\" Iuliano told CNBC.  \"However, the new attestation process is so streamlined that bankruptcy attorneys should be recommending it to every client with student loans,\" he said. Bankruptcy can be 'the only real path out' The easier bankruptcy process may offer a lifeline to many Americans struggling with education debt. Student loan holders have been under pressure from a weakening labor market, a barrage of changes to the lending system and recent trouble accessing relief programs, including debt forgiveness and affordable repayment plans. More than 5 million student loan borrowers are currently in default, and that total could swell to roughly 10 million borrowers soon, the Education Department said earlier this year.The Trump administration will start garnishing the wages of student loan borrowers in default in early January, a spokesperson for the Education Department recently confirmed to CNBC. \"For many people, interest and fees have turned the balance into something they can never repay, so bankruptcy is the only real path out,\" Iuliano said.

    "body": "Zepto isn't the only quick commerce startup in India, and competition is heating up both domestically and globally. The country's online grocery market is set to be worth around $24 billion dollars by 2025, according to Redseer.ZeptoIndian quick-commerce startup Zepto has confidentially filed for an initial public offering, according to a public notice issued by the company on Sunday. The company plans to raise 110 billion rupees ($1.22 billion) of fresh capital. Zepto was valued at $7 billion during its last funding round in October, data from research firm Tracxn showed.Zepto told CNBC it filed its draft prospectus under the confidential route, which keeps its filings private, and declined to disclose further details. Rising competitionQuick commerce, which promises deliveries in as little as 10 minutes, has become one of India's most competitive consumer internet sectors.While e-commerce giant Amazon has long offered same-day delivery services in India through \"Amazon Fresh\", the launch of its 15-minute \"Amazon Now\" service in June marked an aggressive shift into a crowded space.The Jeff Bezos-owned U.S. company has started its quick commerce operations across Indian's three major cities—Mumbai, Delhi and Bengaluru.Amazon India's Country Manager Samir Kumar said on Dec. 1, that it plans to have well over 300 micro-fulfillment centers across Bengaluru, Delhi and Mumbai by the end of the year.\"India's quick commerce market is currently 10% of its e-commerce market, but in the medium to long term it could account for 40%-50%,\" Karan Taurani, executive vice president at Indian broking firm Elara Capital, told CNBC's Inside India last week.Walmart-owned Flipkart also launched its quick commerce service in 2024. Indian food delivery companies, Swiggy and Eternal, which owns Zomato and Blinkit, were among the first movers in this space.Over the last three to five years, several companies have entered the quick commerce market in India and are \" indulging in a price war\" as firms chase a large total addressable market, Taurani said.watch nowBubble concernsThe sector has continued to attract large sums of capital. Earlier this month, Swiggy raised 100 billion rupees from institutional investors to expand its quick commerce fulfilment network, including warehouses located closer to dense neighborhoods.But some industry leaders have warned that the pace of spending may not be sustainable. Blinkit Chief Executive Albinder Dhindsa has reportedly warned of a bubble bursting.He told Bloomberg that the quick commerce industry has relied heavily on \"relentless fundraising\" to cover steep losses and that companies would soon face limits on how long they can continue absorbing them.Zepto's losses reportedly widened in fiscal year 2025 to 33.67 billion rupees from 12.15 billion rupees a year ago. Data from LSEG showed that Swiggy reported a net loss of 31.17 billion rupees in FY25, up from 23.50 billion rupees the year before, while Eternal reported net income of 5.27 billion rupees in FY25.\"If companies don't move to the path of profitability, there could be a bubble,\" Taurani said.",

(Photo by Tang Yanjun/China News Service/VCG via Getty Images)Tang Yanjun | China News Service | China News Service | Getty ImagesBillionaire Elon Musk has put humanoid robots in the spotlight this year, positioning them as central to Tesla's valuation, which he thinks could hit tens of trillions of dollars. But Tesla is yet to sell its flagship humanoid robot Optimus.Instead, it's likely a slew of Chinese companies that will beat Tesla to the punch and begin ramping up production of robots in 2026, as Beijing puts the technology at the center of its strategic plans. \"China currently leads the United States in the early commercialization of humanoid robots,\" Andreas Brauchle, partner at consultancy Horváth, told CNBC by email. \"While both countries are expected to build similarly large markets over time, China is scaling more rapidly in this initial phase.\"Humanoid robots are designed to be shaped and move like a human. Artificial intelligence algorithms power their abilities along with complex hardware like semiconductors. Proponents say they could be used across various settings, from factories to hospitality and even in the home.Beijing makes robots a key priority Over the past few years, China has made robotics a key focus of its tech strategy, unveiling plans to create supply chains and mass production of the machines. Chinese President Xi Jinping and the country's top leaders, known as the Central Committee, met in October and released proposals for the \"15th five-year plan,\" a document that lays out some of the key focus areas for Beijing in the coming years. \"Embodied artificial intelligence,\" a term that refers to AI-driven hardware like robotics or driverless cars, was mentioned in the text.For China, humanoid robots represent an opportunity to address labor challenges in the world's second-largest economy as well as advancing Beijing's quest for tech supremacy.\"China's push into humanoid robotics development is driven by a combination of addressing demographic pressures, driving the next horizon of economic growth, and strengthening its role in global competition,\" Karel Eloot, senior partner at McKinsey & Company, told CNBC.watch nowChina's birth rates are declining and the population is aging, leading to a reduced number of people in the workforce and rising labor costs. Robots are seen as a way to address this. Meanwhile, China is locked in an ongoing tech race with the U.S. across multiple sectors. Robotics, seen as a real-world application of AI, could become a new battleground in 2026. Politico reported this month that Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick has been meeting with the CEOs of robotics companies to form a plan to accelerate the industry. Washington is considering issuing an executive order on robotics next year, Politico reported, citing people familiar with the matter.China's key robotics companies\"China could be the most important market for humanoids,\" RBC Capital Markets said in a note this month. Analysts at the bank forecast a global total addressable market for humanoids of $9 trillion by 2050, with China accounting for more than 60% of that. Chinese robotics firms are attempting to power ahead with mass production. Unitree, which is gearing up for an initial public offering that could value it at around $7 billion, is one of China's buzziest robotics players. The company has various robotics models, including humanoids. This year, it debuted its latest model, the H2, showcasing its ability to dance. Unitree robot performs for visitors at China Summit in pavilion 1 during Web Summit first day of this year's event on November 11, 2025 in Lisbon, Portugal.Horacio Villalobos | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesUBTech Robotics is another of China's key players. It makes humanoid robots for both an industrial setting, like a factory, as well as commercial applications, like being a tour guide. UBTech's flagship industrial model, the Walker S2, is able to swap out its battery itself in order to run 24 hours a day. The company is listed on the Hong Kong stock exchange and this month carried out a share placement to raise around $400 million to fund its expansion. UBTech plans to deliver 500 industrial robots this year and ramp up production of its humanoid robots to 5,000 in 2026 and 10,000 in 2027, the South China Morning Post reported in November.AgiBot is another player that said this month its 5,000th humanoid robot rolled off the production line.Xpeng displayed its humanoid robot called \"Iron\" at the IAA auto show in Munich, Germany on September 8, 2025.Arjun Kharpal | CNBCChina vs U.S. advantagesChina's manufacturing prowess and success in ramping up production in other products like electric vehicles, may give it an edge when it comes to robotics, analysts said.\"The depth of China's supply chain means companies can develop and manufacture robots at a significant cost advantage compared to other regions,\" Ethan Qi, associate director at Counterpoint Research, told CNBC.Indeed, UBTech expects production costs to drop 20% to 30% each year. Meanwhile, various local governments in China have subsidy programs aimed at companies in the robotics sector. The U.S. however, has \"advantages in AI, autonomy and advanced algorithmic development,\" Horváth's Brauchle said. watch nowAmerican firms are \"betting on vertical integration\" — which means owning and controlling more of the supply chain — according to McKinsey's Eloot. This includes components like actuators, which power a robot's movement, as well as the AI software that is integrated into the final product.\"The belief is that tighter ownership of the full system will deliver superior performance, stronger safety cases, and defensible intellectual property,\" Eloot said.China's humanoid robot market will initially be bigger than that of the U.S., but will not remain that way forever.\"Over the long term, both countries are expected to converge toward similarly large markets, whereby absolute mass-market penetration is expected after 2040, driven primarily by high-volume adoption in private households,\" Brauchle said.BottlenecksChina's robotics industry is not without its challenges. One bottleneck is its restricted access to certain chips required for robots. \"I think there's a very high reliance on U.S. chips, for example, Nvidia chips,\" Jacqueline Du, head of China industrial tech research at Goldman Sachs, told CNBC's \"The China Connection\" last month. Charlie Dai, principal analyst at Forrester, noted a number of other potential hurdles, such as AI limitations in unpredictable operating conditions for humanoids and regulatory barriers.\"Together, these challenges slow commercialization over the next two years and require coordinated innovation, security, and policy frameworks,\" Dai told CNBC.There are also the technological difficulties of replicating the human movement of limbs like hands and fingers — an incredibly complex task that demands capable of mimicking biological functions. \"Most robotic hands fall well short in effective degrees of freedom, sharply limiting their range,\" McKinsey's Eloot notes.Finally, perhaps the biggest challenge is bringing the cost of these complex machines down. Eloot said that product costs for today's advanced humanoid prototypes range from $150,000 to $500,000 per unit. Those need to come down to between $20,000 to $50,000 per unit to \"compete with human labor.\"Beijing's investment bubble concernsEven though robotics is a strategic priority for China, this hasn't stopped regulators from warning about a potentially overheated market.In November, China's top economic planning agency, the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), warned there is a risk of a bubble forming in the humanoid robotic market. The NDRC said that there are more than 150 humanoid robotics companies in China, with that number growing, and many of them are bringing out similar products.In the past, there have been boom and bust cycles around technology that Beijing has given strategic importance, such as electric vehicles.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconAn ETF that tracks Chinese robotics firms rose in 2025. \"Many assume that humanoid robots will soon exceed human-level versatility, speed and autonomy. Manufacturers reinforce this perception through polished demonstration videos and staged trade-show performances that present capabilities not yet reproducible in real industrial environments,\" Horváth's Brauchle said.\"This gap between perception and reality increases the risk of an investment bubble.\"\"A market correction could slow innovation and commercialization momentum,\" Forrester's Dai added.",

    "body": "Two Xiaomi electric car models in different colors are pictured here on Nov. 2, 2025.Sopa Images | Lightrocket | Getty ImagesBEIJING — China's electric car boom is ending in 2025 on a soft note, with sales dipping and analysts warning that a fierce price war is likely to persist.Not only did Tesla see its sales drop by 7.4% from a year ago, but market leader BYD also reported a 5.1% decline, according to data from the China Passenger Car Association covering January through November. BYD's passenger car sales in November alone fell by an even steeper 26.5% from a year ago, while newer rivals, including vehicles powered by Huawei software and models from Xiaomi, recorded sales growth of more than 90% during the same period.The early trio of U.S.-listed Chinese electric car startups — Nio, Xpeng and Li Auto — failed to make the top 10 sellers for the month, despite improvements in monthly deliveries.Market concentration has increased sharply. The top ten manufacturers now account for around 95% of the Chinese new energy vehicle market — up sharply from around 60% to 70% just two or three years ago, according to Xiao Feng, co-head of China Industrial Research at Citic CLSA. New energy vehicles include battery-electric and hybrid-powered cars.\"I think there will be further industry consolidation even though prices matter more than specific brands,\" he said. \"Obviously buyers will not buy a car they [have] never heard of.\"watch nowThe scale of price cuts highlights the pressure. Autohome, an online platform for car sales data in China, even lists vehicles by discount percentage, such as a 432,000 yuan ($61,660) drop for the Mercedes-Benz EQS EV or a 147,000 yuan reduction in the Volvo XC70.Paul Gong, head of China autos research at UBS, expects the price war to keep going \"for years,\" while domestic policy changes will likely weigh on growth next year.Beijing is set to re-impose a purchase tax while scaling back trade-in purchase subsidies, he said. UBS predicts the growth rate of China's electric car sales to roughly halve next year from around 20% in 2025.The market is already saturated, with new energy vehicles accounting for 59.4% of new passenger cars sold in China in November, according to the China Passenger Car Association.Overseas expansionSlowing demand at home is pushing Chinese electric carmakers to expand aggressively overseas, where profit margins are often higher.In the first half of the year, Hangzhou-based Geely said its electric car exports quadrupled, helping bring overall vehicle exports to 184,000. The company entered Australia, Vietnam and four other markets during that time, extending its reach to around 90 countries. The automaker has also launched factories in Egypt, the Middle East and Indonesia.Geely ranks second to BYD in China's new energy vehicle sales.BYD is also expanding its overseas production, including a new factory in Hungary slated to ramp up manufacturing in 2026. The company exported more than 131,000 cars in November alone.Tu Le, founder and managing director at consulting firm Sino Auto Insights, expects more Chinese car manufacturers and battery companies to \"firmly stake their claims in Europe,\" bringing competition closer to the U.S. and Tesla.Foreign automakers Other foreign car companies are still keen on taking a slice of the China market.German auto giant Volkswagen has forged local joint ventures with Xpeng and Chinese automotive chips designer Horizon Robotics. Volkswagen's largest research and development center outside Germany is in Hefei, China, where the automaker said last month it can now complete every step of the vehicle development and approval process locally for the first time.That capability could help Volkswagen launch cars more quickly in China, with several new models planned for 2026.In the first three quarters of 2025, Volkswagen delivered more than 17 million vehicles in China, up 8.5% from a year ago, and far more than the 8.9 million vehicles it delivered in Western Europe.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tWeekly analysis and insights from Asia's largest economy in your inbox\n\t\t\tSubscribe now\n\t\t\n\tChina's market size remains lucrative for foreign businesses. \"It's not lost for the U.S. automakers,\" said Sino Auto Insights' Le.He noted that General Motors still delivers nearly 2 million cars a year in China, and, like Ford, also exports cars from the country. The automakers could turn that manufacturing capacity inward if they can design vehicles capable of competing in China, he said, noting \"that's where GM is closer than Ford.\"Le cautioned that it could be too early for any automaker, domestic or foreign, to declare victory in the world's largest auto market.\"But in China, you could be on top one month, and by next quarter, you're playing catch-up and wonder what happened.\"",

    "body": "watch nowCNBC's Jim Cramer gave advice on how to build a balanced portfolio, suggesting investors both individual growth stocks and index funds.\"Putting some money in an index fund isn't bad advice — it's a good way to play it safe,\" Cramer said. \"But most people can't afford to purely play it safe unless they're already rich, which is why you have to put the other half of your holdings in a mix of individual stocks that you choose and a non-stock hedge.\"Picking one's own stocks can be lucrative, Cramer asserted. But the practice is also risky, he indicated, so investors need index funds as a backup to hedge against inevitable investing mistakes. Index funds are average by design, Cramer continued, saying they are meant to mirror American business. He indicated that index funds alone don't necessarily make as much money as a top growth stock can. He suggested investors looking to earn above average returns should buy several stocks across different industries, as well as a commodity holding like gold or crypto. Cramer emphasized it's wise to seek out good growth stocks, which are ones that have done well historically. It's also important to \"put the work in,\" when managing a portfolio, Cramer said, which means continually researching companies, keeping up with their earnings reports and following industry news.\"Of course, it's better to be average than broke,\" he said. \"Which is why I still advise putting half of your savings in an index fund like the SPY, but you need to use the other half to go after bigger gains.\"",

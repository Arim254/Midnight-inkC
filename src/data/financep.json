    "body": "A new year is the perfect time to reflect on your financial habits and make small changes that can have a big impact. For over a decade, I've worked with clients navigating life transitions, like divorce and retirement, to help them forge their new financial paths. In my experience, there are six money personalities that represent the ways that people's money beliefs and attitudes play out in daily life. Here's my best money advice for each personality going into 2026: 1. The GiverThe Giver has a heart of gold and a generous spirit. Whether helping a friend in need, contributing to a worthy cause, or lending a hand to a stranger down on their luck, the Giver is always there. But this can lead to overspending, neglected personal financial needs, and even feelings of resentment.My best money advice for 2026For the Giver, the key is finding balance. With thoughtful planning and increased awareness of when to say no, you can continue to support others without jeopardizing your financial situation. When you find yourself in a pinch, remember that there are many ways to fill others' cups — as well as your own — that don't cost a dime. In fact, often your time and talents can make an even greater impact than your treasures.2. The TrailblazerTrailblazers don't follow the herd — they lead it. They exude confidence and embrace thoughtful risks. They are driven, focused, and relentless in their pursuit of success. But here's the twist: Their fierce independence can lead to burnout and a reluctance to ask for help.My best money advice for 2026While a Trailblazer may excel at creating wealth, managing it requires a much different skill set. It's important to learn how to delegate. By recognizing your limitations and leveraging the expertise of others, you can maximize the potential of your hard-earned money. This will ultimately reduce stress and enhance your overall financial success — allowing you to enjoy the fruits of your labor.3. The SkepticMoney? Nah, that's for the fat cats and money-grubbers. The Skeptic's mistrust can stunt their financial progress. They often feel caught between believing they don't deserve wealth and panicking at the thought of pursuing it. The result? They continue to repeat behaviors that leave them feeling financially insecure.My best money advice for 2026Writing down all your positive qualities can help you see that your worth isn't tied to your bank account. Surround yourself with people who are financially successful — as well as kind and generous — to help reshape your views on money. Witnessing how wealth can be used for good might help dismantle the assumption that it inherently breeds greed.4. The High RollerHigh Rollers live for the moment! Fancy things light them up. Saving for the future? Not so much. Their emotions can lead to impulsive purchases, and they can easily lose track of spending — which may result in a pile of debt. This constant pursuit of pleasure can cause the High Roller to feel empty inside. My best money advice for 2026Exploring how you cope with emotions, like boredom or anxiety, can help reduce impulse purchases. Budgeting apps or spending trackers, along with thoughtful discussions about the relationship between self-worth and material things, can help build self-awareness around spending habits. Transitioning to a cash-only system can also be a powerful tool for you — limiting your ability to rely on credit cards when you're tempted to splurge.5. The Penny PincherThe Penny Pincher is a perpetual saver, regardless of how much they have in the bank. They are disciplined and resourceful when it comes to spending (which is a good thing!) and often feel guilty after making a purchase — even when it's a necessity. Typically, they are debt- and risk-averse and fear losing it all, which can cause them to miss out on opportunities to effectively grow their wealth or benefit from valuable experiences.My best money advice for 2026Learning the basics of investing can empower the Penny Pincher to take calculated risks. Setting specific spending goals — like taking a dream vacation or planning fun nights out with friends — can help you shift your focus from what you might lose to what your money can help you gain and experience. This approach can build confidence and create a more balanced perspective.6. The AvoiderThe Avoider would rather not think about money, let alone talk about it. They typically have no idea where they stand financially. And frankly, most don't know where to start. But the more they avoid their situation, the more anxious they become.My best money advice for 2026Even the smallest actions can spark change. Dedicating just 10 minutes each week to reviewing your account balances, exploring your spending, or asking for help can empower you to confront your financial situation with less stress. Additionally, seeking resources like online articles, podcasts, or financial literacy classes can help you take actionable steps to improve your financial well-being.Keep in mindThese aren't meant to be reductive labels but rather lenses that build awareness of your current habits. Remember:These aren't rigid categories. Your behavior with money can change over time as life experiences shape new financial habits.Growth is always possible. Recognizing your tendencies empowers you to make intentional shifts and cultivate healthier behaviors.Identifying with multiple types is typical. It's common to exhibit traits from more than one personality type.And of course, you may want to seek personalized financial advice that's tailored to your specific needs.Steph Wagner is a nationally recognized thought leader in women's wealth and financial empowerment who serves as the National Director of Women & Wealth at Northern Trust.

    "body": "Many U.S. workers are ringing in the new year with a raise as new minimum wage increases take effect in states and localities across the country on Thursday.More than 8.3 million workers are expected to benefit from minimum wage hikes in 19 states, which will collectively add an estimated $5 billion in earnings nationwide, according to a December report by the Economic Policy Institute.On top of changes to state minimum wages, many cities and municipalities with local wage standards increased their minimum wages Thursday as well. For example, Seattle's minimum wage rose to $21.30 an hour, and the minimum wage in Minneapolis is now $16.37 an hour.Minimum wage workers in Hawaii will see the largest jump in their hourly pay. The state's minimum wage rose by $2 per hour, from $14 to $16. Other states with minimum wage increases include Arizona, California, Michigan, New Jersey and New York.The federal minimum wage remains at $7.25 an hour, where it has stood since 2009.

    "body": "After 60 years at the helm of Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett stepped down as the holding company's CEO at the end of 2025. Throughout his career, the business and investing icon routinely shared wisdom to help others build successful lives, from  singing the praises of compound interest to offering a thought exercise for living without regrets.At Berkshire Hathaway's 2025 annual shareholder meeting, Buffett gave advice to those at the opposite end of their career as him: \"Don't worry too much about starting salaries and be very careful who you work for because you will take on the habits of the people around you,\" he told the audience in response to a question about lessons he learned early on. \"There are certain jobs you shouldn't take.\"Though it may be tempting for workers just starting out to accept whichever job offers the most competitive salary they can find, Buffett emphasized that other factors may be more important over the course of your career.'Find people that are wonderful to work with'While a good starting salary can help set you up for financial success, your coworkers and managers may play an outsized role in your long-term career success, Buffett said.\"Who you associate with is enormously important,\" he said. \"Don't expect that you'll make every decision right on that, but you are going to have your life progress in the general direction of the people that you work with, that you admire, that become your friends.\"He drew on his own experience of finding mentors who bestowed their wisdom upon him as a young person learning the ins and outs of running a business, and encouraged young people to find people in their own lives who have careers they admire and go work with them.\"I've had five bosses in life and I liked every one of them — they were all interesting. I still decided that I'd rather work for myself than anybody else,\" Buffett said. \"But if you find people that are wonderful to work with, that's the place to go.\"Don't do it for the moneyIn addition to surrounding yourself with smart and interesting people, Buffett said it's wise to look for a job you would do even if you didn't need the money. \"I've had that for a very long time,\" he added.Not only has the 95-year-old made a lot of money throughout his career, but he has often shared how much he's enjoyed his work and colleagues. \"I get to do what I like to do with people that I love,\" Buffett said in a 2008 interview. He encouraged young people to find a similarly meaningful career.\"It's interesting to me that in the investment business, so many people get out of it after they've made a pile of money,\" he said at Berkshire's shareholder meeting in 2025. \"You really want something that you'll stick around for whether you need the money or not.\"Want to give your kids the ultimate advantage?

    "body": "Beginning January 1, 2026, an estimated 6.1 million more Americans will be eligible to open and contribute to Achieving a Better Life Experience (ABLE) accounts, according to National Disability Institute.ABLE accounts are tax-advantaged investment accounts designed for Americans with disabilities. Created by Congress in 2014, ABLE accounts allow beneficiaries to save for qualified expenses like education, housing, health care and more without affecting their Medicaid or Social Security income eligibility. Previously, beneficiaries had to have a qualifying medical condition that began before their 26th birthday, but that cut-off rises to age 46 as of January 1 due to the ABLE Age Adjustment Act passed in 2022. The expanded age requirement brings the total number of Americans eligible to open ABLE accounts up to around 14 million, per NDI's estimates.ABLE accounts are \"a powerful wealth planning, financial and tax planning vehicle,\" Juliana Crist, head of ABLE programs at Vestwell, a financial technology company that manages 19 of the country's ABLE plans, tells CNBC Make It. Crist describes it as \"kind of a super-powered Roth\" individual retirement account.As with Roth IRAs, contributions to ABLE accounts are made with after-tax dollars. Beneficiaries can invest the money in a portfolio which grows tax-free, and qualified withdrawals are not subject to income taxes. But with ABLE accounts, beneficiaries can set aside more money per year and can use the funds whenever they want, rather than needing to wait until they hit a certain age. ABLE account withdrawals for qualified expenses are not taxed as income. However, withdrawals for non-qualifying expenses are subject to income tax and a 10% penalty.Account holders can have up to $100,000 saved in an ABLE account without losing access to Supplemental Security Income and Medicaid benefits. Individuals with savings exceeding $2,000 in regular savings or other investment accounts risk losing those benefits.Here's how ABLE accounts work and who can open one.Eligibility requirements and contribution limitsABLE accounts are available to U.S. citizens in all 50 states who are either eligible to receive Supplemental Security Income or Social Security Disability Insurance or can self-certify that they have a qualifying medical condition. \"A lot more people can qualify for an ABLE account than realize it,\" Crist says. \"People hear that this is an account for people with disabilities, and that person might actually have a qualifying medical condition, but they don't think of it as a disability ... a lot of our eligible people just don't realize that this could be a tool they could even use.\"To self-certify, individuals must have a written diagnosis of a qualifying condition signed by a licensed physician that also confirms the onset of the condition was before the individual's 46th birthday. Qualifying conditions include blindness, as defined by the Social Security Administration, along with a variety of other physical and mental conditions such as Autistic Spectrum Disorder and Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder. Individuals do not have to provide proof of diagnosis when opening an ABLE account, but they need to certify that they have one, according to ABLE National Resource Center.Beneficiaries can contribute up to $20,000 a year into an ABLE account in 2026. Individuals who work but do not contribute to a workplace retirement plan can contribute an additional amount equal to the individual poverty threshold — $15,650 in 2026 — or up to their employment earnings, whichever is less. That limit rises to $19,550 for Alaska residents and $17,990 for Hawaii residents in 2026. Virtually anyone can contribute to a beneficiary's ABLE account including parents and other family members or employers. But total contributions may not exceed the annual limit.How to choose the best ABLE account for youNearly every state and Washington, D.C. sponsor ABLE accounts and most allow out-of-state participation, according to ABLE NRC. Four states — Idaho, North Dakota, South Dakota and Wisconsin — don't have their own plans. Depending on where you live and your personal financial situation, it may make sense to shop around between different states' plans — a search which could benefit from the help of a financial professional.If you're looking to open an ABLE account, Crist suggests starting your search with your home state's plan if one is available. That's because some states offer state income tax deductions for ABLE account contributions.Plus, \"sometimes it's easier and more familiar to be able to reach out to a person in your own backyard if you have questions or you need support,\" she adds.From there, you'll want to compare investment options and costs for different ABLE accounts. Generally, ABLE accounts have management fees that can run around $30 a year, Crist says. The plans also may charge a fee equal to 0.1% to 0.3% of assets in your account she says. Some plans offer more investment options than others, which could be a deciding factor.\"Some states have much larger investment menus, like 15 options to choose from, as opposed to some states only offer four investment options to choose from — simple versus complex, so that can appeal to different types of savers and investors,\" Crist says.If you want a debit card attached to your account, some plans offer that as well, but not all, she adds.Want to give your kids the ultimate advantage?

    "body": "Singapore tops the list in the 2025 Global Talent Competitiveness Index by INSEAD and Portulans Institute.Calvin Chan Wai Meng | E+ | Getty ImagesSingapore's economy expanded 5.7% year on year for the fourth quarter, driven mainly by strong manufacturing growth in the three months through December. The Ministry of Trade and Industry said that Singapore's manufacturing sector posted a 15% expansion, a massive jump compared to the 4.9% growth in the third quarter. Growth during the quarter was largely driven by the biomedical manufacturing and electronics clusters, the ministry noted.Manufacturing makes up about 20% of the city-state's GDP.The advance estimate was higher than the revised 4.3% growth in the previous quarter, lifting full-year GDP growth to 4.8%, as announced by Prime Minister Lawrence Wong in his New Year's message. The 4.8% growth had surpassed the country's Ministry of Trade and Industry's upgraded forecast of \"around 4%\" in November. \"This is a better outcome than we expected, given the circumstances,\" Wong said, while warning that sustaining the current pace of growth would be challenging.Singapore had earlier cautioned that 2025 would be challenging, citing trade risks after U.S. President Donald Trump's administration slapped trade tariffs on dozens of countries in his \"Liberation Day\" on April.Despite having a free trade agreement with the U.S. since 2004, Singapore was hit with the 10% baseline tariff. Wong said at the time that \"these are not actions one does to a friend.\"The country also warned in April last year that zero growth was also a possibility, and eased monetary policy twice in 2025 to prepare for a slowdown. This is breaking news, please check back for updates.",

    "body": "watch nowLabor market weakness, uncertainty about inflation and political pressure will push the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates aggressively in the early part of 2026, according to Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics.Though markets and Fed officials themselves see only modest easing in the year ahead, Zandi expects the central bank to enact three cuts of a quarter percentage point each before midyear.\"Behind the decision to ease monetary policy further will be the still flagging job market, particularly in the early part of 2026,\" the economist wrote in his look at the year ahead published recently. \"It will take more time for businesses to feel certain that they will not be wrong-footed by shifting trade and immigration policies and other threats before they resume hiring.\"\"Until then, job growth will remain insufficient to forestall further increases in unemployment, and as long as unemployment is on the rise, the Fed will cut rates,\" he added.Zandi's forecast is at least a step ahead of both market and Fed expectations, both of which point to a slower pace of reductions.Market pricing currently points to two cuts, the first not coming until at least April and the second more likely in the back half of the year, probably around September, according to CME futures data as expressed through its FedWatch gauge. Fed policymakers have an even more cautious outlook.The central bank's grid of individual officials' expectations indicates just one cut through the entire year, according to an update presented earlier in December. Minutes from that meeting showed the cut at the meeting was a close call, as officials expressed the likelihood of additional reductions but at a tepid pace.But Zandi thinks the confluence of factors will cause the Fed to move more quickly. One wild card: the potential for President Donald Trump to remake the central bank's hierarchy.As things stand now, three of the seven Fed governors are Trump appointees: Christopher Waller, Michelle Bowman and Stephen Miran. With Miran's term expiring in January, Trump is likely to appoint another loyalist to the post. From there, Chair Jerome Powell's term at the helm expires in May, though his term as governor runs into early 2028. In addition, the president is in the process of trying to remove Governor Lisa Cook, though courts have blocked him so far.That adds to the likelihood that the president, a staunch advocate of lower interest rates, will look to exert his will on the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee.\"Trump will also pressure for lower interest rates. Federal Reserve independence will steadily erode as the president appoints more members to the Federal Open Market Committee, including the Fed chair in May,\" Zandi wrote. \"Given the approaching midterm congressional elections, the political pressure on the Fed to lower rates further to support economic growth is likely to intensify.\"The FOMC meets again on Jan. 27-28. Market pricing is putting just a 13.8% probability of a cut at that meeting, according to the CME.",

    "body": "watch nowDemocratic Socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders and right-wing Gov. Ron DeSantis agree on virtually nothing. But they found common ground this year as leading skeptics of the artificial intelligence industry's data center boom. The alignment of two national figures on the left and right signals that a political reckoning is brewing over the AI industry's impact on electricity prices, grid stability and the labor market. The opposition could slow the industry's development plans if it reaches a broad bipartisan consensus. Sanders, I-VT, has called for a national moratorium on data center construction. \"Frankly, I think you've got to slow this process down,\" Sanders told CNN in a Dec. 28 interview. \"It's not good enough for the oligarchs to tell us it's coming — you adapt. What are they talking about? They're going to guarantee healthcare to all people? What are they going to do when people have no jobs?\"Florida Gov. DeSantis unveiled an AI bill of rights on Dec. 4 that would protect local communities' right to block data center construction among other provisions. The staunch Republican's proposal could run afoul of the White House, which is pushing to scale up AI as quickly as possible. President Donald Trump issued an executive order on Dec. 11 to prevent \"excessive state regulation\" of AI.\"We have a limited grid. You do not have enough grid capacity in the United States to do what they're trying to do,\" DeSantis said of the AI industry's data center plans at an event in The Villages, Florida. \"As more and more information has gotten out, do you want a hyperscale data center in The Villages? Yes or no,\" the governor asked. \"I think most people would say they don't want it.\" DeSantis is finishing out his second term as Florida's governor and his future political ambitions are unclear. Sanders has said his fourth term as Vermont's senator will likely be his last. Florida and Vermont are not major data center states. But rising utility bills played a key role in the landslide victory of Democrat Abigail Spanberger in the governor's race this year in Virginia, the world's largest data center market. Residential electricity prices are forecast to rise another 4% on average nationwide in 2026 after increasing about 5% in 2025, according to the federal Energy Information Administration. With cost of living at the center of American politics, the impact of data centers on local communities will likely play a role in the mid-term elections next November. \"We have gone from a period where data centers were sort of seen as an unmitigated good and as an engine of growth by a lot of elected officials and policymakers to people now recognizing that we're short,\" said Abe Silverman, who served as general counsel for the public utility board in New Jersey from 2019 until 2023 under Democrat Gov. Phil Murphy. \"We do not have enough generation to reliably serve existing customers and data centers,\" Silverman said. Crisis on the biggest gridThe shortage is most acute on the nation's largest grid, PJM Interconnection, where data center demand is pushing the system to a tipping point. The grid will be six gigawatts short of its reliability requirement by 2027, according to PJM. The power shortage is nearly equivalent to the electricity demand of Philadelphia, Silverman said. This makes blackouts more likely, he said. \"Instead of a blackout happening every one in 10 years, we're looking at something more often,\" the analyst said. \"It's at a crisis stage right now. PJM has never been this short,\" said Joe Bowring, president of Monitoring Analytics, which serves as the independent market monitor for PJM.  PJM Interconnection serves more than 65 million people across 13 states in the Mid-Atlantic and Midwest. It includes pivotal swing states for the mid-term elections like Pennsylvania and Virginia. The price to secure power capacity in PJM has exploded in recent years with $23 billion attributable to data centers, according to watchdog Monitoring Analytics. Those costs are ultimately passed on to consumers. This amounts to a \"massive wealth transfer,\" the watchdog told PJM in a November letter.  \"I don't think we've seen the end of the political repercussions,\" said Rob Gramlich, president of Grid Strategies, a power sector consulting firm. \"And with a lot more elections in 2026 than 2025, we'll see a lot of implications,\" Gramlich said. \"Every politician is going to be saying that they have the answer to affordability and their opponents' policies would raise rates.\" The shortage will be exacerbated by Trump's recent decision to pause all offshore wind farms under construction off the East Coast, Silverman said. This includes Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind, a massive 2.6 gigawatt project that would help supply the huge data center market in northern Virginia.\"By stopping a project that had line of sight to coming online in the very near future, you are directly increasing the prices that we all pay for electricity and not by a little bit,\" Silverman said. \"That's a huge, huge additional hole that we now have to dig out of.\"Data centers are facing pushback on multiple fronts now. The PJM watchdog has called for the grid to reject data centers that it does not have the power to serve or require them to bring their own generation. Virginia's utility regulator is now requiring data centers to pay a majority of the cost of new transmission and generation that serves them beginning in 2027. Data center developers next year will likely start moving to build more power plants onsite, called co-location, as they struggle to secure supply on the grid quickly, said Brian Fitzsimons, CEO of GridUnity, a company that uses software to help utilities navigate connection requests. But Silverman said \"co-location\" has problems that will also face political scrutiny.  \"Co-location is effectively taking a generator off the market,\" he said. \"It would be unethical to end up with a situation where data centers are able to buy private power plants that expose the rest of us to a greater chance of blackouts.\" ",

    "body": "watch nowThe big artificial intelligence bubble question has been the tech industry's buzziest debate all year, and one robot has weighed in with its opinion.KOID is a short, slender humanoid robot with a black metal body and a bright ring of light for a face. KOID is manufactured by Unitree, one of China's hottest tech companies, and the Nvidia-powered robot shares a name with an ETF launched in June by KraneShares that focuses on robotics companies.The walking, talking machine on Tuesday told CNBC that the AI bubble debate is certainly a \"hot topic,\" but KOID gave a neutral outlook on whether the boom is actually a looming bubble.\"We might see a lot of excitement around AI right now, but whether it's a bubble or just a transformative wave, is something only time will tell,\" KOID said.The AI-powered machine added that AI and humanoids are \"here to stay\" and will continue to evolve.Weighing in at about 77 pounds, KOID is one of Unitree's G1 models. Those humanoids have 23 degrees of freedom, or specific points where it can move independently, enabling it to achieve full-body maneuvers from dancing to boxing. KOID is available to purchase on RoboStore, the largest U.S. distributor of Unitree robots, with the models ranging from $8,990 to $128,900.A humanoid robot from RoboStore joins CNBC's \"Power Lunch\" on Dec. 30, 2025.CNBCRoboStore CEO Teddy Haggerty told CNBC's \"Power Lunch\" on Tuesday that while KOID can be programmed to do many kinds of tasks, the industry is still in a \"prototyping\" stage of figuring out where robots fit in everyday living.\"What is it that we really want robots to do?\" Haggerty said. \"Do we want robots to become our new housekeepers? Do we want them to help manufacturing? Do we want them to replace jobs?\"KOID, however, seems a little more certain of its own future. It said that robots will likely become \"even more versatile and integrated\" into daily life.\"They'll help out a variety of fields, from home assistants to industrial tasks, making life a bit easier and more efficient,\" the robot said.The humanoid robotics race has been heating up this past year, with companies including Boston Dynamics and Agility Robotics emerging in the space. Tesla's Optimus robots have taken center stage, with CEO Elon Musk saying that they are a future key contributor to the company's valuation.Yet while Optimus robots have yet to hit the market, Chinese companies have been ramping up production to beat the U.S. to the punch — with Unitree spearheading the pack.The company outperformed its peers in events like the World Robot Conference and World Humanoid Robot Games. Unitree, which is heading for an initial public offering that could value it at up to $7 billion, debuted its latest H2 model earlier this year.Read more CNBC tech newsElon Musk envisions humanoid robots everywhere.

    "body": "Warren Buffett and Greg Abel walkthrough the Berkshire Hathaway Annual Shareholders Meeting in Omaha, Nebraska on May 3, 2025. David A. Grogen | CNBC The investing world's north star is beginning to dim.Warren Buffett has handed over the CEO reins to Greg Abel after a six-decade run that turned an unremarkable textile company into one of the most powerful compounding engines in market history, leaving investors grappling with how singular that achievement really was, even as he remains chairman of Berkshire Hathaway.When Buffett took control of Berkshire in the mid-1960s, its shares traded around $19. By the end of 2025, a single Class A share was worth over $750,000. From 1964 — the year before Buffett took control of Berkshire — to 2024, the one-of-a-kind conglomerate delivered a compounded annual gain of 19.9%, nearly double the S&P 500's 10.4%, resulting in an overall return of more than 5.5 million percent, according to the company's latest annual report. The shares added another 10% to that return in 2025.The record was built on an unusually spare formula: use insurance float as a source of low-cost capital, buy businesses with durable cash flows and allow time to do most of the work. That approach produced long-held stakes in companies such as Coca-Cola and American Express, while Berkshire expanded into railroads, utilities and manufacturing through wholly owned subsidiaries.\"If it was that easy to do again, somebody would be doing it,\" Bill Stone, chief investment officer at Glenview Trust Company and a Berkshire shareholder, said. \"You think about the duo that having Charlie Munger as your partner, it's just hard to imagine that coming together again anytime soon.\"As Buffett relinquishes the helm, investors are increasingly focused on what disappears with him. Seth Klarman, founder of the Baupost Group, called Buffett \"an American role model\" and said his retirement represents more than a leadership transition. \"The world of investing will be different without Warren Buffett at the helm of Berkshire,\" Klarman said in a tribute.'Going Quiet'Buffett has said he's \"going quiet\" as he steps back, signaling a reduced public presence even as he remains chairman. Abel will assume responsibility for Berkshire's annual shareholder letters, a tradition Buffett began in 1965 that became essential reading on Wall Street for its plainspoken lessons on markets, management and capital allocation. Buffett will keep penning a Thanksgiving message, however.The annual letters were one pillar of Buffett's influence. The other was Berkshire's annual shareholder meeting. Often dubbed \"Woodstock for Capitalists,\" the gathering drew tens of thousands of investors to Omaha, Nebraska, each year for hours of unscripted Q&A. The event cemented Buffett's role not just as a steward of capital, but as a steady public voice investors trusted to put market upheaval into perspective.watch nowBuffett also rejected many Wall Street conventions. Berkshire never split its stock, discouraging speculation and cultivating a shareholder base oriented toward decades rather than quarters. The company declined to issue earnings guidance and gave operating managers wide autonomy, while capital allocation decisions remained centralized in Omaha.\"Warren, as chairman, will be an advisor to Greg, a cultural anchor, and a real long term thinker,\" said Ann Winblad, managing director at Hummer Winblad Venture Partners and longtime Berkshire shareholder, on CNBC's \"The Exchange.\" \"Will the company fundamentally change in its strategies? No. ..The culture of Berkshire Hathaway, which is what I've invested in, which is patient, long term, careful and decisive investing, will probably still remain.\"The company held a record $381.6 billion in cash at the end of September, underscoring both its financial firepower and Buffett's caution in a richly valued market. Berkshire has also been a net seller of equities for 12 straight quarters, a rare and sustained retreat that reflects limited opportunities at its scale.Shareholder attention is shifting to a less settled part of the succession plan: the fate of its $300 billion equity portfolio. With no obvious successor possessing a comparable record in public equities, some analysts say Berkshire may ultimately scale back active stock selection, particularly given the size and concentration of the portfolio.Buffett has also repeatedly cautioned shareholders against mistaking volatility for failure. \"Our stock price will move capriciously, occasionally falling 50% or so as has happened three times in 60 years under present management,\" he wrote. \"Don't despair; America will come back and so will Berkshire shares.\"",

    "body": "As the restaurant industry endured another difficult year, many chains opted to close underperforming locations as they try to turn around their businesses.Inflation-weary consumers have pulled back their restaurant spending, choosing to eat at home or chasing deals when they go out for a meal. While some restaurants have won over reluctant diners, the industry has largely struggled with the sales slump. Traffic to restaurants open at least a year fell every month in 2025, excluding only July, according to Black Box Intelligence. In years past, restaurant closures have been more concentrated across casual-dining chains, which lost customers to fast-casual competitors like Chipotle. But this year, chains across the industry announced plans to shutter at least hundreds of locations.In such a tough environment, some restaurant companies even filed for bankruptcy protection. Hooters, Pinstripes and On the Border were some of the notable names that landed in bankruptcy court this year.Here are the chains that announced closures in 2025:StarbucksA Starbucks coffee cup sits on a table inside a Starbucks in New York on Dec. 2, 2025.Spencer Platt | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesIn September, the coffee giant announced a $1 billion restructuring plan that included closing roughly 500 of its North American locations. The closures even extended to shuttering its upscale Reserve Roastery cafe in Seattle, the company's hometown.Starbucks' announcement followed CEO Brian Niccol's one-year anniversary at the helm of the company. Under his leadership, Starbucks is trying to reverse a sales slump in the U.S., its biggest market. Executives plan to share more details about the turnaround at the company's upcoming investor day in late January in New York. Wendy'sA Wendy's restaurant sign in Austin, Texas, Nov. 10, 2025.Brandon Bell | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesIn November, Wendy's announced that it would undergo a strategic review of its restaurant footprint and begin closing underperforming locations that quarter. While the company did not announce a specific number of closures, interim CEO and CFO Ken Cook told analysts that the company could shutter a \"mid-single digit percentage\" of its U.S. restaurants shuttering, which would mean hundreds of the burger chain's locations.The closures are one phase of Wendy's \"Project Fresh\" turnaround plan. The company has reported same-store sales declines even as rivals McDonald's and Burger King see higher demand for their Big Macs and Whoppers.In 2024, Wendy's shuttered about 140 locations.Denny'sA view of a Denny's restaurant in Hayward, California, Feb. 14, 2025.Justin Sullivan | Getty ImagesIn February, Denny's said it planned to close between 70 and 90 restaurants in 2025. In recent months, the diner chain's sales sunk as customers opted to visit cheaper fast-food restaurants for breakfast. The shift in behavior led the company to shutter underperforming locations and attempt to improve the rest of its restaurant footprint.In November, the chain announced it had sold itself for $620 million to Yadav Enterprises, TriArtisan Capital Advisors and Treville Capital Group. The deal is expected to close in the first quarter of 2026, pending regulatory approval.Jack in the BoxGeri Lavrov | Getty ImagesIn April, Jack in the Box said it would close between 150 and 200 restaurants as part of its \"Jack on Track\" strategy to improve its financial performance. By the end of its fiscal 2025 on Sept. 28, the chain had permanently shuttered 86 restaurants. Bahama BreezeIn May, Bahama Breeze parent company Darden Restaurants closed 15 of the chain's locations, which represents roughly a third of its overall footprint. Following the closures, executives decided that the Caribbean-inspired chain was not a strategic priority for Darden, so the company is exploring strategic alternatives for the brand. Options include selling the chain outright or converting its restaurants into other Darden brands, like Olive Garden. Darden expects to make a decision on Bahama Breeze by the end of its fiscal 2026, which concludes in May.Hardee'sDozens of Hardee's locations will close by end of the year after the franchisor sued ARC Burger, one of its largest franchisees. Hardee's alleges that the operator fell behind on payments like royalties, rent and taxes. ARC, which is owned by private equity firm High Bluff Capital Partners, operated 77 Hardee's restaurants before the legal battle began. Its footprint stretched across eight states, including Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Missouri, Montana, South Carolina and Wyoming, according to legal filings.Papa John'sThe Papa John's Pizza logo is shown in Austin, Texas, May 9, 2024.Brandon Bell | Getty ImagesIn the first three quarters of 2025, Papa John's shuttered 173 restaurants worldwide, according to company filings. Most of the closures affected international locations, although 62 of the pizza chain's U.S. locations also closed.Despite the closures, Papa John's still had nearly 6,000 restaurants in operation at the end of September.Noodles & Co.Michael Siluk | UCG | Universal Images Group | Getty ImagesAt the end of October, Noodles & Co. had closed 29 company-owned restaurants this year, and executives said that they planned to shutter another two to five underperforming locations by the end of 2025. In 2024, the fast-casual chain closed 20 locations.By the end of 2026, Noodles & Co. is planning to close another 12 to 17 stores, as it aims to improve the company's financial performance and boost sales at the chain's nearby locations.Outback SteakhouseAn Outback Steakhouse restaurant in Daly City, California, Jan. 31, 2025.Justin Sullivan | Getty ImagesIn October, restaurant company Bloomin' Brands closed 21 locations across the company. The closures hit Outback Steakhouse, the gem of its portfolio, as well as Bonefish Grill and Carrabba's Italian Grill.Bloomin' has identified nearly two dozen other restaurants that will not renew their leases when they expire over the next four years, executives said in November when sharing the company's quarterly earnings. At the same time, the company announced a $75 million turnaround plan to improve Bloomin' sales and its overall financial health.",

    "body": "©Studio One-one | Moment Unreleased | Getty ImagesDepending on where you live, relying on a postmark to prove you mailed your tax return, mail-in ballot, bill payment or any other time-sensitive document by a specific date may no longer work as you expect.As the U.S. Postal Service continues implementing operational changes in an effort to shore up its finances and modernize its infrastructure, the agency expects an increase in delays between when you mail something and when it is postmarked, according to a public notice in the Federal Register that took effect Dec. 24. A postmark shows the date your mail was processed, and historically has been applied the same day you mail an item. However, due to limiting pickups at many postal locations and mail now often traveling farther to regional processing centers where the postmark is applied, \"the postmark date does not inherently or necessarily align with the date on which the Postal Service first accepted possession of the mailpiece,\" the notice reads.Read more CNBC personal finance coverageUSPS changes may delay postmarks.

Here's who the lapse will hit hardestTrump officials to start garnishing wages of student loan borrowers in JanuaryCNBC's Financial Advisor 100: Best financial advisors, top firms rankedWhile households increasingly use digital options to file taxes, pay bills and handle other personal business, there are still people who use the Postal Service for time-sensitive mail.Of the 163.6 million tax returns received by the IRS this year, about 10 million were not filed electronically, according to the agency's latest data. About 29% of voters mailed in their ballots last year, according to USAFacts. And 13% of households paid their bills by mail last year, according to the Postal Service's 2024 Household Diary Study. \"Consumers have always assumed that the post office will postmark their mail on the day they take it to the post office or drop it in a box,\" said Edgar Dworsky, founder of advocacy site Consumer World and a former assistant attorney general in Massachusetts who focused on consumer protection. \"Who would expect it could be several days before it has a postmark on it?\"Mail is traveling farther to processing facilitiesWhile the Postal Service said in the notice that it is not changing how it postmarks mail — that has always been done at its processing facilities — the agency has added language to its Domestic Mail Manual to clarify for the public when postmarks are applied.In 2021, USPS unveiled an initiative called Delivering for America to improve its financial condition, which included increasing postage prices and redesigning its network and processing operations.Changes to transportation schedules and the consolidation of processing facilities under that initiative mean many post offices that previously sent mail twice a day to a hub now do so only once in the morning, according to new research from the Brookings Institution. Under the new network, roughly 26% of post offices are within 50 miles of their assigned regional center, and another 26% are between 150 and 500 miles away, according to the research.The upshot is that some mail generally doesn't begin moving through the system until at least the following day, resulting in the postmark not being applied the day you mailed that item. In some cases — i.e., ahead of weekends or holidays — it could take longer than a day for that crucial stamp to be applied.How to meet mailing deadlines amid postmark delaysThe importance of ensuring your mail is postmarked in time applies to a range of documents or forms that have deadlines. For example, ballots that are mailed can require a postmark by a specific date to be counted, as can federal and state tax returns and certain legal documents.If someone wants to ensure \"that the postmark aligns with the date of mailing, the customer may take the mailpiece to a post office, station or branch and request a [manual postmark] at the retail counter,\" according to a statement issued by the Postal Service.Asking a postal clerk to manually postmark something costs nothing. Or, you can pay $5.30 to send a time-sensitive document via certified mail, which includes a receipt for the sender as well as a return receipt showing when it was delivered and who signed for it. Alternatively, a certificate of mailing, which you keep for your records, costs $2.40 and shows the date you mailed something.\"Waiting in line at the post office is never fun, but you get that proof of timely mailing,\" said Josh Youngblood, an enrolled agent and founder of The Youngblood Group in Dallas. \"The reality is, otherwise, you are at the mercy of whenever that postmark gets applied.\"Given the possibility of a delay, you may want to explore electronic filing or payment options when available. Or, give yourself a deadline to mail something important well ahead of the official due date.Considerations for mailing tax returnsAhead of tax filing season, it's worth taking note of the possible delay. While April 15 is when federal taxes are due, the IRS considers any tax return postmarked on or before April 15 as being filed on time, even if it's not received until days later.So if you are prone to waiting until the last minute to file taxes and do not do it electronically, you can't assume dropping off your return at the post office or putting it in a mailbox means it will get postmarked that day.\"If I'm mailing something to the IRS, I'm going to go into the post office to the actual person, where they stamp it,\" Youngblood said.If your tax return is postmarked late and you owe taxes, you may face penalties and interest. \"There is a penalty for filing late, and even a day late is still late,\" Youngblood said.For individual tax returns — i.e., your Form 1040 — the penalty for filing a late return is 5% of the tax due for each month or partial month the return is late, capping out at 25%. On top of that, the penalty for paying late is 0.5% of your unpaid balance per month, also capped at 25%. Interest is also charged on unpaid balances, accruing daily at the federal short-term rate plus 3%.However, if you have filed and paid taxes owed on time over the previous three years, you can request that the penalties be waived, Youngblood said.",

    "body": "Google CEO Sundar Pichai waves as he arrives at the Artificial Intelligence Action Summit at the Grand Palais in Paris, Feb. 11, 2025.Benoit Tessier | ReutersAfter a tough start to the year, Google closed out 2025 with its strongest performance — from Wall Street's perspective — since 2009, when the company's shares doubled coming out of the financial crisis. Alphabet's stock popped 65% for the year, slightly ahead of its gains in 2021. The shares hit their 2025 low in April, as President Donald Trump was threatening massive tariffs on trading partners, but they've since jumped over 100%. Among the eight tech companies valued at over $1 trillion, Alphabet was by far the biggest gainer. The next sharpest rallies came from chipmakers Broadcom and Nvidia, which gained 49% and 39%, respectively. Stock Chart IconStock chart iconAlphabet vs. the Nasdaq in 2025Getting to this point required Google to stare down the skeptics, who questioned whether the search giant could maintain its dominance in the artificial intelligence era. With OpenAI's ChatGPT and Sora services capturing an increasing amount of consumer engagement and concerns swirling around the future of online advertising in a world of AI chatbots and agents, Google's business model was viewed as a target for major disruption. Alphabet's 18% plunge in the first quarter was its worst period for the stock since mid-2022. But the mood started to improve in the second quarter. In April, the company promoted 16-year company veteran Josh Woodward to run the Gemini app, Google's answer to ChatGPT. In August, Woodward's group debuted image generator Nano Banana, a Gemini feature that lets users turn to AI to generate images. The feature went viral at launch when people used it to blend multiple photos together to create personal digitized figurines. By the end of the following month, the Gemini app surpassed 5 billion images and dethroned OpenAI's ChatGPT at the top of Apple's App Store. Google's AI talent pool deepened over the summer, when the company announced an agreement to bring in Varun Mohan, co-founder and CEO of AI coding startup Windsurf, along with other senior research and development employees from the high-profile startup that had previously been in talks with OpenAI for a $3 billion acquisition. That deal fell apart, and Google ended up agreeing to pay $2.4 billion in licensing fees and for compensation to snag Windsurf's top engineers. Winning in AI and in courtSoon thereafter, Google was handed a gift in the courtroom.Despite losing its antitrust case last year, as Google was found to hold an illegal monopoly in internet search, U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta ruled in September against the most severe consequences that were proposed by the Justice Department. Google would not have to divest Chrome and could still make payments to companies to preload products, meaning it could continue paying Apple billions of dollars to be the default search engine on iPhones. One consequence of the ruling is that Google would have to share certain data with competitors. Gemini's momentum has been the biggest story.Last month, Google announced Gemini 3, an upgraded AI model, almost eight months after rolling out Gemini 2.5.While Gemini still trails ChatGPT in overall usage, it's been rapidly making up ground. According to data this month from Similarweb, ChatGPT's share of generative AI traffic dropped to about 68% from 87% a year earlier, while Gemini jumped to roughly 18% from about 5% over that stretch. watch nowAnalysts at Citizens wrote in a Tuesday report that the critical development for Alphabet isn't just about Gemini but the effect of the company's AI investments on the core search business. AI Overviews is Google's search-embedded service that provides AI-powered summaries for user queries. The Citizens analysts said the \"incorporation of updated models is improving the relevance of answers, which we view as a further tailwind to engagement.\"\"We come away believing Google can further accelerate search revenue in 4Q25, which we view as the key question near term,\" wrote the analysts, who recommend buying the shares even after the latest rally. Analysts have also highlighted Google's broad strength in cloud computing, where it's chasing Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure, and the company's leadership in robotaxis through Waymo as potential catalysts heading into 2026. Still, with investors piling into the stock, expectations are sky-high. Analysts project fourth-quarter revenue growth of 15% to over $111 billion when Alphabet next reports results, according to LSEG, and growth throughout next year is expected to be in the low teens.In October, Alphabet raised its capital spending forecast for 2025 to as high as $93 billion, up from $85 billion. Analysts see that number jumping to more than $114 billion in 2026, according to FactSet. CEO Sundar Pichai has repeatedly said the company is responding to soaring demand. He said on the October earnings call that Google's cloud business signed more deals over $1 billion in 2025 through the third quarter than in the two prior years combined. Analysts at Pivotal Research warned in a note to clients earlier this month that should OpenAI, one of Google's key customers, cut its spending or face other issues due to its mounting obligations, \"it is likely to temporarily get pretty ugly for AI stocks and the market in general.\"But the Pivotal analysts have a buy rating on the stock and raised their price target by $50, to $400, about 28% above Wednesday's closing price of $313.\"We believe the shakeout, if it happens, will mirror 2000 and will inevitably be a healthy weeding out process leaving fewer much more dominant competitors, with GOOG leading the way,\" they wrote. — CNBC's Jennifer Elias contributed to this report.

    "body": "File: President Donald Trump looks on after signing an executive order in the Oval Office of the White House on April 9, 2025.Saul Loeb | Afp | Getty ImagesPresident Donald Trump issued the first vetoes of his second term Tuesday, blocking bills that would support a pair of bipartisan infrastructure projects in Colorado and Florida. Trump's veto of the Colorado bill, the Finish the Arkansas Valley Conduit Act, which Congress unanimously approved earlier in December, enraged the state's lawmakers. The bill would reduce the payments local communities must provide to the federal government for the construction of the Arkansas Valley Conduit, a pipeline poised to provide clean drinking water to rural communities in Colorado. In a message to Congress after vetoing the legislation, Trump said the bill would \"continue the failed policies of the past by forcing Federal taxpayers to bear even more of the massive costs of a local water project — a local water project that, as initially conceived, was supposed to be paid for by the localities using it.\"\"Enough is enough. My Administration is committed to preventing American taxpayers from funding expensive and unreliable policies,\" he said. Bipartisan Colorado lawmakers who pushed the bill erupted after the veto, vowing Congress will override it. Some argued that Trump is making good on his vow for retribution after Colorado refused to free Tina Peters, a former Colorado county clerk who was convicted last year of crimes relating to the breach of voting machines after the 2020 election.Trump warned earlier this year in a Truth Social post that if she was not released, he would \"take harsh measures!!!\" Trump issued a pardon for Peters in December, but it was largely symbolic since Peters was convicted in a state court.Read more CNBC politics coverageEuropean Union approves over $105 billion toward Ukraine aid package for next two yearsBrown and MIT prof shooter suspect Neves Valente is found dead, authorities saysTrump Media to merge with fusion company TAE Technologies, DJT stock soarsTrump announces 'warrior dividend' of $1,776 to U.S. soldiers in prime-time speechEpstein accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell petitions to vacate sex crime convictionCongressional stock trading ban bill to get a vote in new year: House RepublicansFBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino is stepping down in JanuaryObamacare subsidies extension to get vote after 4 Republicans buck leadershipFCC chief Carr tells Senate that his agency is 'not formally ... independent'Trump vowed to block tankers carrying Venezuela's oil — nearly a dozen at sea nowKennedy Center to be renamed 'Trump-Kennedy Center,' White House saysTrump vowed to block tankers carrying Venezuela's oil — nearly a dozen at sea nowHouse passes bill to ease permits for building out AI infrastructureTrump sues BBC for $10 billion, claims defamation from Panorama documentaryPentagon takes big stake in new Korea Zinc refinery in Tenn., gets 10% of companyNew Trump tariffs collection hits $200 billion, Customs saysFormer Instacart employee says she was fired over her Democratic congressional campaignUkraine peace talks progressing, Russia open to EU membership, U.S. officials sayNew York AG sues UPS for allegedly shorting Christmas season workers' wagesTrump admin to hire 1,000 specialists for 'Tech Force'Trump doubles down on Rob Reiner criticism after killing; director's son in custodyTSA is giving airline passenger data to ICE for deportation push: NYTTrump's AI order may be 'illegal,' Democrats and consumer advocacy groups claimTrump sued by preservation group seeking to halt White House ballroom projectTrump says 'no big deal' after new Epstein photos showing him releasedPutin can fund war for years, ex-official says as Trump's resolve is testedIndiana redistricting bill that Trump demanded defeated in state SenateHouse passes INVEST Act to ease investment standards, boost capital in marketsDOJ fails again to indict New York AG James, a Trump target: ReportsTrump 'sells out' U.S. national security with Nvidia chip sales to China: WarrenTrump pushes for top prosecutor nominee Halligan after Comey, James cases tossedTrump willing to seize more oil tankers off Venezuela coast: White HouseSeized tanker will go to U.S. port, Trump admin intends 'to seize the oil'GOP lawmakers seek Trump aid for agricultural equipment after tariff pressureTrump says Fed could have 'at least doubled' latest interest rate cut'Spoof' ship: Seized oil tanker hid location, visited Iran and VenezuelaTrump admin touts pulling 9,500 truckers off road for failing English testsSwiss government says new 15% U.S. tariff ceiling retroactive to mid-NovemberHomeland Security Dept. buying Boeing 737s for ICE deportationsTrump officials move to end student loan payment pause for millions of borrowersJudge unseals Ghislaine Maxwell grand jury materials, citing Epstein files actUkraine at 'critical moment' in war as European allies ramp up pressure on RussiaDemocrats establish AI working group as industry bolsters DC presenceEx-Trump lawyer Habba resigns as NJ U.S. attorney after disqualification\"This isn't governing.

I'll keep fighting to get rural Colorado the clean water they deserve.\"Sen. John Hickenlooper, D-Colo., also alleged Trump's veto was partisan. \"Donald Trump is playing partisan games and punishing Colorado by making rural communities suffer without clean drinking water,\" Hickenlooper said on X. \"Congress should swiftly overturn this veto.\"GOP Rep. Lauren Boebert, a staunch Trump ally, said on her X account that \"This isn't over.\"In a statement she gave to Colorado-based NBC-affiliate KUSA, Boebert said she \"hope[s] this veto has nothing to do with political retaliation for calling out corruption and demanding accountability.\"Boebert was one of the Republicans who joined Democrats in compelling the release of files related to notorious sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Trump did not mention Peters in his rationale for vetoing the legislation. On Wednesday, however, he issued a Truth Social post saying, \"God Bless Tina Peters, who is now, for two years out of nine, sitting in a Colorado Maximum Security Prison.\"\"Hard to wish her a Happy New Year, but to the Scumbag Governor, and the disgusting 'Republican' (RINO!) DA, who did this to her (nothing happens to the Dems and their phony Mail In Ballot System that makes it impossible for a Republican to win an otherwise very winnable State!), I wish them only the worst. May they rot in Hell,\" the President wrote.Congress' unanimous passage of the bill suggests it will have the votes to override Trump's veto if GOP leadership in both chambers allows it. Two-thirds of both the House and the Senate would be needed to override the veto.Rep. Jeff Hurd, another Colorado Republican, said in a post to X that he will \"continue fighting for rural Colorado by working across party lines to get this project back on track and ensure our communities are not left behind.\" CNBC has reached out to House Speaker Mike Johnson's office to ask if he will allow the chamber to override the veto. The Florida bill Trump vetoed, the Miccosukee Reserved Area Amendments Act, also passed Congress by voice vote. The bill would have expanded the Miccosukee Reserved Area to include an area known as the Osecola Camp, part of the Everglades National Park. Trump in a message to Congress said he vetoed the bill in part to prevent \"American taxpayers from funding projects for special interests, especially those that are unaligned with my Administration's policy of removing violent criminal illegal aliens from the country.\"In Trump's first term, he vetoed a total of 10 bills. His first veto came in 2019, two years into his term, to overturn a congressional move to end a national emergency at the southern border. Congress failed to override that veto.",

Enacted in the 90s, IDR plans cap people's monthly payments at a share of their discretionary income and excuse any remaining debt after a certain period, typically 20 or 25 years.\"A lot of people are very close to their 20- or 25-year mark,\" said Ethan Miller, a certified financial planner and founder of Planning for Progress in the Washington area. Miller specializes in student loans. \"Those are the folks who really need to be thinking about how the so-called tax bomb ... is going to impact them,\" he said.  Public Service Loan Forgiveness, a program for government and nonprofit employees that eliminates federal loans after 120 qualifying monthly payments, remains tax-free.  The federal tax bill on student loan forgiveness could be substantial. The average loan balance for borrowers enrolled in an IDR plan is around $57,000, said higher education expert Mark Kantrowitz.For those in the 22% tax bracket, having that amount forgiven would trigger a tax burden of more than $12,000, Kantrowitz estimated. Lower earners, or those in the 12% tax bracket, would still owe around $7,000.Plus, some borrowers could incur state tax liability on their forgiven balance, experts say.   More than 42 million Americans hold student loans, and the outstanding debt exceeds $1.6 trillion.Eligibility for student loan forgiveness in 2025 The new potential tax liability comes at the same time many student loan borrowers have faced delays in accessing debt forgiveness. But in a recent settlement between the American Federation of Teachers and the Trump administration, Education Department officials clarified that borrowers who became eligible for student loan forgiveness in 2025 won't owe federal taxes on the relief, even if their debt isn't officially discharged until later. That means if you received confirmation that you're eligible for debt cancellation in 2025, you should save that dated record, said Nancy Nierman, assistant director of the Education Debt Consumer Assistance Program in New York.You may be able to use that document to prove you were entitled to the relief before the tax-free provision lapsed, Nierman said.Prepare for student loan forgiveness taxes Starting in 2026, student loan forgiveness counts as income, which could \"thrust your tax bracket up,\" depending on the size of your eliminated balance, said CFP and certified student loan professional Landon Warmund with Reliant Financial Services in Kansas City, Missouri.That could increase your tax bill and impact eligibility for various deductions and credits, he said. \"The biggest thing that I'm stressing for borrowers is that if you know this is going to come, be proactive with the planning,\" said Warmund, who is also a member of CNBC's Financial Advisor Council. watch nowFirst, you'll need to know when you're eligible for IDR plan forgiveness. That could now be harder without the tracking tool previously available on StudentAid.gov, which was removed earlier this year, experts say. The Education Department \"currently has no plans to resume using the tool,\" according to a December court filing.  However, you can work with an advisor to figure out when you are eligible for forgiveness and start estimating the tax impact, depending on that year's income. Then you can begin setting money aside and explore IRS payment plan options. \"You need to be prepared for these tax liabilities,\" Warmund said. But you can \"get ahead of it and plan accordingly.\"",

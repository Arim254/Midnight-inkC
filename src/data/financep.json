    "body": "Microsoft President Brad Smith speaks at a press conference at the Representation of the State of North Rhine-Westphalia about future visions for the development and application of artificial intelligence in education in NRW in Berlin on June 4, 2025.Soeren Stache | Picture Alliance | Getty ImagesAmerican tech companies should \"worry a little bit\" about the subsidies their Chinese competitors receive from their government in the AI race, Microsoft President Brad Smith told CNBC.As competition between U.S. and Chinese companies intensifies to develop the most advanced models, Smith said that the U.S. has \"an advantage in terms of access to the most powerful chips in the world\" and \"other technology innovation.\"But, speaking in an interview on the sidelines of the AI Impact Summit in New Delhi, India, he also said: \"I do think we always have to think about, maybe even worry a little bit about Chinese subsidies.\"Chinese AI companies have been supported by their government with measures such as a multi-billion-dollar national investment fund and vouchers for cheaper energy for their computing needs. Smith's warning comes after Chinese firms released a slew of models over the past two weeks, and their lower-cost AI models could be attractive in developing nations.Smith said subsidies from Beijing to Chinese companies were \"the fundamental approach that China successfully took to disrupt the telecommunications market,\" when state money and support helped companies like Huawei and ZTE expand.\"Some American companies disappeared. European companies like Ericsson and Nokia were thrown on the defensive,\" Smith added. Smith said data centers from Chinese firms Huawei and Alibaba exist around the world and \"it will not be difficult for China to subsidize those.\"\"I think for the rest of us, we have to compete with that, and we have to be good at competing with that, with the support of our governments,\" Smith said.CNBC approached Alibaba and Huawei for comment about whether they have accepted Chinese state subsidies but had not received a response as this article went live.Alibaba's cloud computing division, through which it sells its AI services, operates globally. But outside China, it doesn't always build data centers, instead partnering with other infrastructure players. How China supports its tech companiesBeijing launched a 60.06 billion yuan ($8.42 billion) national AI fund last year to invest in early-stage projects.Cities across the country, from Shanghai to the tech hub of Shenzhen, have offered \"vouchers\" to reduce the cost for companies looking to rent computing power.Cheap energy has been another advantage for Chinese companies that are trying to build out the power-hungry infrastructure needed to train and run AI models.Microsoft on Wednesday said it was on pace to invest $50 billion by the end of the decade to help bring AI to developing countries in the \"Global South,\" which includes investments in infrastructure and reskilling.Rory Green, TS Lombard's chief China economist, told CNBC this week that a \"China tech sphere\" could easily form in developing countries.\"For these economies, I think the choice is fairly simple, and you could see easily a world where maybe most of the world's population is running on a Chinese tech stack in five to 10 years' time,\" Green said.",

    "body": "Nikolas Kokovlis | Nurphoto | Getty ImagesTesla Europe announced plans to add xAI's Grok, an AI chatbot, to its vehicle infotainment systems in the U.K. and eight other markets across Europe.It remains to be seen if the addition of this technology will revitalize Europeans' interest in buying Teslas.Elon Musk's automaker saw electric vehicle sales in Europe decline by 27%, according to data from the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association, or ACEA. The decline for Tesla came as Europeans' continued strong adoption of battery electric vehicles. BEVs, the only kind that Tesla makes, represented 17.4% of the market across Europe in 2025 according to the ACEA. China's BYD gained market share across the continent with innovative, and more affordable, EV models.Tesla's lack of affordable new models last year, and an ongoing consumer backlash in response to Musk's incendiary political rhetoric, and endorsements of anti-immigrant extremists including Tommy Robinson in the U.K. and Germany's AfD party weighed on the appeal of the Tesla brand last year, according to Brand Finance. Tesla is not the only automaker integrating chatbot features into its infotainment systems. For example, Volvo has announced plans to add a Google Gemini-based conversational AI assistant to its EX60 electric vehicles. During a fourth-quarter earnings update, Tesla revealed that it had invested $2 billion into Musk's xAI.After that, Musk's aerospace and defense juggernaut, SpaceX, acquired xAI in an all-stock transaction that valued the combined entity at $1.25 trillion. Before those deals, xAI had merged with social network X (formerly Twitter), and its Grok product had become the subject of myriad regulatory probes in Asia, Australia and throughout Europe including by regulators in Ireland, the U.K., France and the European Commission.As CNBC previously reported, Grok enabled users to easily create and share deepfake explicit images based on photos or clips of real people without their consent, including deepfake images depicting child sexual abuse. Last summer, Grok generated and spread antisemitic hate speech across social network X and praised Adolf Hitler, drawing earlier regulatory probes by the European Commission.A Tesla owner in Canada raised the alarm about Grok's lack of safeguards after it was added to her vehicle. As CBC reported, her son used Grok to generate entertaining comments about soccer athletes, and Grok eventually asked the minor to send nudes. Tesla and xAI have not said whether they can limit minors' access to Grok in Tesla vehicles, or moderate outputs of the chatbot to be appropriate for minors by default.Besides criticism of Grok's lax safety guardrails, driver distractibility remains a point of concern.Mike Nelson, who is a partner at Nelson Law and an automotive safety researcher, said his own Tesla Model Y features Grok in the U.S., and he has enjoyed using it. However, the addition of chatbot technology to vehicles' infotainment systems, he said, introduces a new \"distraction layer\" for drivers. \"Research shows that even in hands-free mode, you are more distracted when you are talking on the phone and driving,\" Nelson said. \"Adding Grok introduces more stimuli.\" A professor of machine learning and public policy at Carnegie Mellon University, Rayid Ghani, told CNBC that researchers and regulators, and insurance companies especially, should hasten to conduct \"practical evaluations\" of chatbots.With a lack of benchmarking and standards across the industry, he said, \"we do not yet understand the information needs of drivers, how well Grok or other chatbots fulfill those needs compared to other options and whether chatbots may change driving behavior and exactly how.\" Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

    "body": "BAE Systems attracted record orders in 2025, and now the UK defense staple is setting its sights on years of growth amid a global ramp-up in spending.Its shares rose 3.6% on Wednesday after its full-year earnings report showed sales soared 10% last year to reach a record £30.7 billion ($41.7 billion).That helped push operating profits to £2.93 billion, a 9% year-on-year increase, as revenues grew 8% to £28.3 billion.The FTSE 100-listed company, which manufactures a range of aircraft, weapons, munitions and warships, saw its order backlog hit £83.6 billion, a £5.8 billion increase from 2024. Now, BAE is preparing to capitalize on years of future growth as geopolitical fissures usher in what CEO Charles Woodburn called a \"new era of defense spending\" driven by \"escalating security challenges.\"The company expects sales to grow by between 7% and 9% in 2026, with guidance for cumulative free cash flow between 2026 and 2028 in excess of £6 billion.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconBAE Systems.\"We're well positioned to provide both the advanced conventional systems and disruptive technologies needed to protect the nations we serve now and into the future,\" Woodburn said in a statement accompanying Wednesday's earnings.\"With a record order backlog and continuing investment in our business to enhance agility, efficiency and capacity, we're confident in our ability to keep delivering growth over the coming years.\"BAE Systems' share price is up 22.6% year-to-date, and more than 57% over the past 12 months.Last year, the company secured £36.8 billion of orders. Highlights included a £4.6 billion deal between the UK and Turkey for 20 Typhoon aircraft and an associated weapons package, as well as a £10 billion agreement with Norway's government to provide Type 26 frigates for its warship program. It also secured a $1.2 billion contract to provide space-based missile-tracking capabilities and other satellite equipment to the U.S. Space Force.Bernstein analysts recently named BAE Systems as one of four European defense stocks that will be critical to the growing push for greater military sovereignty in the region, as nations there turn to continental suppliers for arms and equipment and away from U.S. manufacturers.—CNBC's Sam Meredith contributed to this report.",

    "body": "Germany's huge fiscal expansion is now starting to show up in macro data, and investors are betting it will turbo-charge European growth in the coming months.But defense spending — a cornerstone of the package — could fall short of the ambitious ramp-up this year, a Goldman Sachs note says.The historic fiscal stimulus plan includes a 500 billion euro ($591 billion) off-budget infrastructure investment fund for transport, digital and energy spending, and a defense spending increase of more than 1% of GDP. It's starting to flow through to macroeconomic numbers, Bank of America said this week.BofA analysts highlighted a recent 40% surge in German factory orders on a three-month annualized basis, including bulk orders on heavy machinery, which includes arms and weapons, and electric and electronic equipment. That suggests more orders related to defense, the analysts said.The engine of EuropeA BofA survey of European fund managers showed a record 74% of survey participants expected growth to accelerate in Europe in the coming months. Almost two-thirds (63%) of those polled named Germany's far-reaching fiscal stimulus package as the main catalyst, cementing the country's status as the \"engine of Europe.\"\"Germany continues to be the most preferred equity market in Europe,\" said BofA analysts, led by Andreas Bruckner, in the Feb. 17 note.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconDAX.But a Goldman Sachs analyst has warned that spending on defense and investment will fall short of the government's budget targets this year.German fiscal policy will \"take center stage\" this year, contributing to close to half of the 1.1% growth it expects for Germany in 2026, they predicted. Goldman analysis showed Germany's defense budget has surged by 25 billion euros this year to 119 billion euros — a rise of more than 25%. But given the scale of the ramp-up, execution on the ambitious defense budget will fall short of last year's spend, Niklas Garnadt, senior European economist at Goldman, warned in a Feb. 16 note. That said, Garnadt said he still expected the overall defense spend to increase to reach 109 billion euros — some 2.4% of GDP — this year, a hike of 21 billion euros, or almost 0.5% of GDP.\"Procurement and maintenance account for most of this increase,\" he said. \"Pre-commitments for future procurement and maintenance spending have already increased substantially over the last years and orders for defense-related industries picked up notably in Q4 2025.\"Strategic ambitionsGermany's locking-in of higher military spending forms part of what investors see as a defense \"mega-trend,\" with sustained, longer-term rearmament driving a broader push towards strategic sovereignty for the continent. Speaking at last week's Munich Security Conference, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz warned that the post-World War Two rules-based order \"no longer exists.\" Germany's Rheinmetall — the continent's largest defense company — is one of several stocks seen as well-placed to capitalize on its growing push for military autonomy.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconRheinmetall.By comparison, spending on the various areas of the infrastructure package — transport, energy and climate, and digital — will also see increases, but budget execution is likely to be mixed, Garnadt said.Overall, total federal spending across Germany's main budget and the three major off-budget funds is predicted to grow from 554 billion euros to 600 billion euros. But Garnadt said spending will likely come in lower than budgeted by the government, predicting it would fall some 33 billion short of the \"ambitious\" target.\"While investment in the digitization and climate and energy categories should see lower execution rates, we expect support for hospital investment and loans to social security to be fully executed,\" Garnadt said.\"For transport infrastructure — the largest category — we expect execution above 90%,\" he added.",

    "body": "The Late Show with Stephen Colbert and on Tuesday, Sept. 2, 2025. Scott Kowalchyk | CBS | Getty Images\"Late Show\" host Stephen Colbert on Tuesday night called CBS' denial of his claim that it blocked the broadcast of his interview with Texas state Rep. James Talarico \"crap\" — and urged the network and its parent, Paramount Skydance, to stand up to the \"bullies\" in the Trump administration.Colbert's broadside came hours after CBS issued a statement on the controversy. The host, whose show will end in May as it was canceled by CBS, held up a printed copy of the network's statement about Talarico's interview during his show Tuesday night and said, \"I don't even know what to do with this crap.\"He then pulled a plastic doggy bag from behind his desk, picked up the statement, tied a knot and mimed throwing it away before cutting to commercial.The controversy is the latest flap to spark speculation that CBS is currying favor with the Trump administration as Paramount makes a hostile tender bid for Warner Bros Discovery. If WBD's shareholders accept Paramount's bid, federal government regulators would need to sign off on the deal.Colbert had invited Talarico, who is running in the Democratic primary for a U.S. Senate seat from Texas, to appear on Monday night's broadcast of \"The Late Show with Stephen Colbert.\"But early in that night's show, Colbert said to his studio audience that CBS' lawyers had told him \"in no uncertain terms ... that we could not have him on the broadcast.\" Colbert said the lawyers wanted to avoid running afoul of new guidance by Federal Communications Commission Chairman Brendan Carr that suggests broadcast talk shows could be required to abide by the so-called equal time provision requiring broadcasters to give political candidates equal coverage if their opponents appear on air.Colbert noted that he had put Talarico's interview on the \"Late Show\" YouTube channel — the video has been seen more than 4.4 million times.CBS, in its statement on Tuesday afternoon, denied Colbert's main allegation that it had barred the interview from being aired.\"The Late Show was not prohibited by CBS from broadcasting the interview with Rep. James Talarico,\" the network said.\"The show was provided legal guidance that the broadcast could trigger the FCC equal-time rule for two other candidates, including Rep. Jasmine Crockett [D-Texas], and presented options for how the equal time for other candidates could be fulfilled,\" CBS said.Colbert scoffed at the statement during Tuesday's show.\"They know damn well that every word of my script last night was approved by CBS lawyers who, for the record, approved every script that goes on the air,\" Colbert said.\"In fact, between the monologue I did last night, and before I did the second act talking about this issue, I had to go backstage,\" he said. \"I got called backstage to get more notes from these lawyers. Something that had never, ever happened before, and they told us the language they wanted me to use to describe that equal time exception, and I used that language,\" Colbert said. \"So I don't know what this is about.\"Colbert went on to say he wasn't \"mad\" at the network and does not want an \"adversarial relationship.\"\"I'm just so surprised that this giant global corporation would not stand up to these bullies,\" he said.\"Come on. You're Paramount. No, no, no, you're more than that. You're Paramount+,\" Colbert cracked. \"And for the lawyers to release this [statement] without even talking to me is really surprising.\"The host also noted that there has long been \"a very famous exception to\" the equal time rule, \"and that exception included talk shows, interviews with politicians.\"\"We looked, and we can't find one example of this rule being enforced for any talk show interview, not only for my entire late-night career, but for anyone's late-night career, going back to the 1960s,\" he said.Colbert said that Carr has \"not gotten rid of\" that exception for talk show hosts \"yet.\"\"But CBS generously did it for him and told me, unilaterally, that I had to abide by the equal time rules, something I have never been asked to do for an interview in the 20 years of this job,\" he added.\"Now, that decision, I want to be clear, is their right, just like I have the right to talk about their decision on air last night,\" Colbert said.Paramount did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment.Early voting in the Texas Democratic primary began Tuesday. Talarico is in a close contest against U.S. Rep. Jasmine Crockett. The winner will face the victor of the Republican primary between Sen. John Cornyn and Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton. Democrats have not won a statewide race in Texas since 1994.CNBC has reached out to the FCC for comment.",

The commitment represents the first tranche of investments by Japan following a landmark trade deal between the two countries, one in which Tokyo pledged to invest $550 billion in American-based projects and Trump cut tariffs on most Japanese imports to 15%.\"Our MASSIVE Trade Deal with Japan has just launched!\" Trump said Tuesday in a social media post.\"The scale of these projects are so large, and could not be done without one very special word, TARIFFS,\" he added. Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi said the projects strengthen the Japan-U.S. alliance and were expected to bring increased sales and business expansion for Japanese companies.\"We believe these initiatives truly embody the purpose of this Strategic Investment Initiative, namely the promotion of mutual benefit between Japan and the United States, the enhancement of economic security, and the promotion of economic growth,\" Takaichi said in a post on X, according to a Google translation.By far the largest investment is a natural gas facility in Ohio that's expected to generate 9.2 gigawatts of power.U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said the Portsmouth Powered Land Project, valued at $33 billion and operated by SB Energy, a subsidiary of Japan's SoftBank, would be \"the largest natural gas generation facility in history.\" Read moreThe White House said Japan would also finance a $2.1 billion deepwater crude oil export facility off the Texas coast. At full capacity, the Texas GulfLink project is expected to generate up to $30 billion in annual U.S. crude exports. Dallas-based energy infrastructure group Sentinel Midstream is developing the project. The Commerce Department said the third major project refers to plans to create a synthetic diamond grit facility in Georgia, with Japan set to invest approximately $600 million.The project is set to be operated by Element Six, part of De Beers Group, the world's leading diamond company. Diamond grit, dust and powder are critical raw materials in U.S. industrial manufacturing due to their exceptional hardness and wear resistance, the Commerce Department said, making the material to U.S. economic and national security.",

Kevin Carter | Getty ImagesMortgage interest rates dropped last week to the lowest level in a month, prompting more current borrowers to seek savings in a refinance. While lower rates didn't give potential buyers much incentive, the run on refinances was enough to push total mortgage demand 2.8% higher compared with the previous week, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association's seasonally adjusted index. The average contract interest rate for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages with conforming loan balances, $832,750 or less, decreased to 6.17% from 6.21%, with points remaining unchanged at 0.56, including the origination fee, for loans with a 20% down payment. \"Treasury yields ended the week lower as weaker data on retail sales and home sales outweighed better-than-expected readings on the job market for January,\" said Joel Kan, vice president and deputy chief economist at the MBA, in a release. As a result, applications to refinance a home loan rose 7% for the week and were 132% higher than the same week one year ago. Last year, rates were 76 basis points higher. While that annual jump may seem large, refinancing was at extremely low levels at this time last year. \"Refinance applications increased across all loan types, marking the strongest week for refinancing since mid-January,\" Kan added.Get Property Play directly to your inboxCNBC's Property Play with Diana Olick covers new and evolving opportunities for the real estate investor, delivered weekly to your inbox.Subscribe here to get access today.Applications for a mortgage to purchase a home dropped 3% for the week and were just 8% higher than the same week one year ago. While lower mortgage rates are making homes slightly more affordable, new supply is not coming onto the market fast enough, and concern over the broader economy has consumers sitting on the sidelines. Mortgage rates didn't move at all to start this holiday-shortened week, but economic data set for release this week could impact the current trajectory. In general, however, mortgage rates have been hovering in a pretty narrow range, between 6% and 6.25%, since the start of this year. ",

    "body": "A researcher works in the lab at the Moderna Inc. headquarters in Cambridge, Massachusetts, US, on Tuesday, March 26, 2024. Adam Glanzman | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesModerna said on Wednesday the Food and Drug Administration has agreed to review its experimental mRNA flu shot, reversing the agency's earlier decision to refuse to accept the application in a move that stunned Wall Street and the medical community. The announcement clears a path forward for the vaccine, which is key to Moderna's experimental combination Covid-flu jab and the company's goal of breaking even by 2028. The FDA is slated to make a decision on the flu shot on Aug. 5, which will allow Moderna to make the vaccine available for the upcoming influenza season. \"Pending FDA approval, we look forward to making our flu vaccine available later this year so that America's seniors have access to a new option to protect themselves against flu,\" said Moderna CEO Stéphane Bancel in a release. Shares of the biotech company rose more than 6% on Wednesday. Moderna said it had a \"constructive\" meeting with the FDA and proposed a revised regulatory approach that addresses criticisms the agency made when refusing to accept the application last week, tailoring its new proposal to an older population.Under the new approach, Moderna is seeking full approval for the shot in adults ages 50 to 64 and an accelerated approval of the shot for people 65 and up. The latter means that upon approval, Moderna will have to conduct an additional post-marketing study in older adults to confirm its benefits. In a statement, Health and Human Services spokesperson Andrew Nixon confirmed that the FDA has accepted the modified application. The agency specifically took issue with Moderna's decision to compare its product to a standard, approved flu shot in a phase three trial, arguing that it \"does not reflect the best-available standard of care\" in the U.S. The FDA's previous feedback expressed a preference for Moderna to use a higher-dose vaccine for older adults as a comparator in the trial. In an interview with CNBC on Wednesday before the announcement, FDA Commissioner Dr. Marty Makary did not indicate that the agency would reverse course. But he emphasized that the FDA reviewed the application and the initial late-stage trial on the shot when it came in, so \"it's a little bit of a misnomer to say that it was not looked at.\" Makary said the agency's guidance to Moderna on its mRNA-based flu shot \"was pretty clear.\" He said the FDA recommended that the group of participants ages 65 and up in the study who didn't take Moderna's shot receive the \"standard of care, not the substandard of care\" as a comparison product. Moderna has disputed that reasoning, noting that FDA rules and guidance do not actually require trials to use the most advanced or highest-dose vaccine as a comparator in clinical studies. The company also said it was inconsistent with the FDA's prior written communication about the trial design, even before the study began, where the agency said using the standard flu shot would be \"acceptable.\"The saga follows sweeping changes to U.S. immunization policy and regulation over the past year under Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a prominent vaccine skeptic. Moderna last week said the decision specifically stemmed from the FDA's top vaccine regulator, Vinay Prasad, who returned to the agency in August after being ousted. Prasad, who heads the agency's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research has been vocal about tightening regulations for vaccines and recently linked child deaths to Covid shots without evidence. Last week, Moderna released a so-called Refusal to File letter from the FDA that was signed by Prasad on Feb. 3. HHS does not typically share those letters, and has not provided any details on who drove the decision-making on the company's application. When asked about his stance on mRNA technology, which Kennedy and some of his supporters have criticized as unsafe, Makary told CNBC on Wednesday that he's \"hopeful and optimistic\" about the platform but would also \"like to see the data.\" \"We're not going to get ahead of the game,\" he said. \"We're going to basically say, we'd like to see the data, how far mRNA technology can be applied is a question where we'd love to see it applied, as far as it can be applied, but it's got to meet our scientific standards, so we'll see what it gets with cancer, with other infectious diseases ...\"",

Wexner is severing his last ties with the retail empire that he founded in 1963.Jay LaPrete | APA congressional deposition of Leslie Wexner, one of Jeffrey Epstein's closest known associates and top benefactors, kicked off behind closed doors in Ohio on Wednesday, a source familiar with the matter told MS NOW.The deposition is occurring weeks after the Department of Justice released millions of additional Epstein-related files, which have revealed new links between the notorious sex offender and major figures in business and politics.Wexner, the 88-year-old retail billionaire and retired founder of Victoria's Secret former parent company L Brands, has faced intense scrutiny for years over his personal and financial relationships with Epstein.Decades earlier, Wexner had given Epstein, a high school math teacher turned well-connected money manager, power of attorney over his finances. Wexner had long been Epstein's only publicly known client.Wexner has not been charged with any crime. After Epstein was arrested on federal sex trafficking charges in July 2019 — and died by suicide in jail a month later — Wexner said he was embarrassed to have been \" taken advantage of by someone who is ... so depraved.\"The Wexner Foundation did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment on Wednesday's deposition.

Timothy A.clary | AFP | Getty ImagesThe Trump administration was sued Tuesday over the abrupt removal of the Pride rainbow flag last week from the Stonewall National Monument in New York City, at the site of the 1969 uprising that ignited the gay rights movement in the United States.The lawsuit, filed by a group of LGBTQ+ advocates and a Greenwich Village community group, said the federal government claimed that Department of the Interior rules bar the flying of anything but the U.S. flags, DOI flags, and the POW/MIA flags in national parks.\"In fact, the opposite is true: The policies the government says require removing the Pride flag expressly permit the [National Park Service] to fly other flags that provide historical context to national monuments — which is precisely what the NPS official Pride flag did at Stonewall for many years,\" the lawsuit says.The lawsuit was filed in U.S. District Court in Manhattan a day after a federal judge in Philadelphia ordered the National Park Service to restore an exhibit at Independence National Historical Park that contained information about the nine slaves who lived with President George Washington in the official presidential residence in Philadelphia in the 1790s. That order will remain in effect pending the outcome of the city of Philadelphia's lawsuit challenging the NPS's removal of the exhibit in January.The Pride flag had flown at the Stonewall National Monument since 2022 after a flagpole was installed there.The monument is located across from the Stonewall Inn, where a July 1969 police raid of the then-underground gay bar was resisted by patrons, and followed by days of riots and protests.\"Before the 1960s, almost everything about living authentically as a lesbian, a bisexual person or a gay man was illegal,\" the NPS page for the monument says. \"The Stonewall Uprising on June 28, 1969 is a milestone in the quest for civil rights and provided momentum for a movement.People gather in protest at the Stonewall National Monument after the Trump administration had the National Park Service remove the LGBTQ+ Pride flag from the site, which is considered the birthplace of the modern LGBTQ+ rights movement, on Feb. 10, 2026, in New York City.Spencer Platt | Getty ImagesThe new lawsuit in Manhattan federal court called the flag's removal on Feb. 9 \"a textbook example of an arbitrary and capricious act.\"\"This was no careless mistake,\" the suit says. \"The government has not removed other historical flags at other national monuments, most notably Confederate flags. Meanwhile, the assault on Stonewall is the latest example in a long line of efforts by the Trump Administration to target the LGBTQ+ community for discrimination and opprobrium.\"New York Mayor Zohran Mamdani, in a Feb. 10 post on X, said, \"I am outraged by the removal of the Rainbow Pride Flag from Stonewall National Monument.\"\"New York is the birthplace of the modern LGBTQ+ rights movement, and no act of erasure will ever change, or silence, that history,\" Mamdani said.Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, on Sunday said he would introduce a bill to make \"the Pride Flag a congressionally authorized symbol.\"Read more CNBC politics coverageEpstein files: DOJ says it logs Congress members' searches to 'protect' victim informationEpstein files: AG Pam Bondi seemed to have Rep.

    "body": "watch nowWhite House economic advisor Kevin Hassett said Wednesday that the authors of a recent New York Federal Reserve paper that found U.S. companies and consumers are shouldering most of the tariff burden should be \"disciplined.\"In a CNBC interview, the National Economic Council director ripped the report, saying that central bank researchers ignored key aspects of how the duties worked and instead simply focused on prices. Hassett said the research also should have included the upward impact on wages and benefits that U.S. companies see by bringing more production onshore.\"I mean, the paper is an embarrassment,\" Hassett said during the \"Squawk Box\" interview. \"It's, I think, the worst paper I've ever seen in the history of the Federal Reserve system. The people associated with this paper should presumably be disciplined, because what they've done is they've put out a conclusion which has created a lot of news that's highly partisan based on analysis that wouldn't be accepted in a first-semester econ class.\"The paper in question was published Feb. 12 on the New York Fed's website.Essentially, the researchers looked at whether countries that export products to the U.S. were lowering their prices, or in effect eating the tariffs, or raising their prices and passing them onto consumers and companies. The paper found that some 90% of the added costs from tariffs were being passed on, though it noted that the impact waned slightly as the year progressed.However, Hassett insisted that the tariffs had little impact on prices and were responsible for a better standard of living.\"Prices have gone down. Inflation is down over time. Import prices dropped a lot in the first half of the year, that leveled off, and real wages were up $1,400 on average last year, which means that consumers were made better off by the tariffs,\" he said. \"So consumers couldn't have been made better off by the tariffs, if this New York Fed analysis was correct. It's really just an embarrassment. I can't imagine who signed off on it.\"The consumer price index in January rose 2.4% from a year ago and is up nearly 2% from April 2025, when President Donald Trump first announced the tariffs. The sore CPI, which excludes food and energy, was up 2.5% in January, its lowest annual gain since March 2021. Import prices in December were flat from a year ago while export prices rose 3.1%, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.A New York Fed official declined comment.",

Global benchmark Brent was up $2.04, or 3.03%, to $69.46 per barrel. U.S. envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner held nuclear talks with Iran in Geneva on Tuesday. Iran's foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, described the discussions as \"constructive,\" according to Iranian media.  Araghchi said the talks yielded a general agreement on guiding principles.Oil prices closed lower Tuesday as traders interpreted the foreign minister's comments as a sign that the U.S. and Iran could still reach a settlement. But Vance said Tehran had failed to address core U.S. demands. \"In some ways it went well, they agreed to meet afterwards,\" the vice president told Fox News on Tuesday evening. \"But in other ways it is very clear that the president has set some red lines that the Iranians are not yet willing to actually acknowledge and work through.\"Trump reserves the right to use force if diplomacy does not succeed in stopping Iran's nuclear program, Vance said. \"We do have a very powerful military — the president has shown a willingness to use it,\" the vice president told Fox News. Sources told Axios, meanwhile, that a U.S. military campaign against Iran would likely be massive, last weeks and look more like a full-fledged war than the raid that captured Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro in January. Iran's Revolutionary Guard conducted war games this week in the Strait of Hormuz, a vital trade choke point for global oil flows. About one-third of all waterborne crude exports pass through the narrow waterway, according to data from energy consulting firm Kpler. The market is worried those oil flows would be disrupted if the U.S. and Iran go to war. Iranian state media said traffic in part of the strait was closed Tuesday due to the military exercises. Kpler did not observe any halt in traffic in the strait on Tuesday, said Matt Smith, an oil analyst at the firm.Trump has stationed the USS Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier in the Middle East. The USS Gerald Ford is en route to the region.Trump said Friday he deployed the second aircraft carrier in case negotiations fail. \"If we don't have a deal, we'll need it,\" the president told reporters outside the White House.

    "body": "Andreypopov | Istock | Getty ImagesThe Trump administration has identified more than 40,000 borrowers eligible for federal student loan forgiveness in January, a recent court filing revealed.More than 10,800 of the borrowers who qualified for the debt cancellation were enrolled in the U.S. Department of Education's Income-Based Repayment Plan; another over 10,700 were in the Income-Contingent Repayment Plan; and 820 borrowers were enrolled in the Pay as You Earn Repayment Plan. Those three programs are all known as income-driven repayment plans. IDRs limit a borrower's monthly bill to a share of their discretionary income and cancel any remaining debt after a certain period, typically 20 or 25 years. Another 18,160 federal student loan borrowers had their debts cancelled in January through the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program, the Education Department said in its recent court filing. Signed into law in 2007 by President George W. Bush, PSLF offers debt cancellation to those who've worked for 10 years at certain not-for-profit organizations or the federal government.Read more CNBC personal finance coverageParents with student debt face deadline to secure affordable repayment, forgivenessSecure 2.0 let employers pair emergency savings and 401(k)s, but few have done soHome sellers start getting lower prices at 70, research shows — here's whyAverage IRS tax refund is up 10.9% so far this season, early filing data showsEarly estimates point to lower Social Security COLA for 2027Senators call for longer Social Security Fairness Act lump-sum payment timelineHere's the inflation breakdown for January 2026 — in one chartAverage tax refund is up 22%, Bessent says — what filers can expect this seasonK-shaped economy looks like 'jaws of a crocodile,' economist says: Here's whyHow EPA 'endangerment finding' repeal could impact your walletMedical emergencies can lead to debt and bankruptcy — even for insured AmericansBigger tax refunds may be coming — but missing key forms could risk an auditHow Social Security Fairness Act payments may affect beneficiaries' taxesCredit card debt tops $1.28 trillion, consistent with 'K-shaped' economy: NY FedHow affordability led to a chasm between stock prices, consumer optimismStudent loan complaints at record high, CFPB finds, but agency omits detailsCNBC's Financial Advisor 100: Best financial advisors, top firms rankedThe January numbers suggest the Trump administration is increasing its efforts to ease the financial burden of student loan debt.Amid a barrage of recent changes to the federal lending system and sweeping layoffs at the Education Department in March, many student loan holders have struggled to access the loan-forgiveness opportunities available under their borrowing terms. More than 42 million Americans hold student loans, with total outstanding debt exceeding $1.6 trillion, according to the Congressional Research Service.Education Department officials agreed to share status updates on the processing of student loan discharges as part of an October settlement with the American Federation of Teachers, a teachers' union representing some 1.8 million members. The AFT sued the Trump administration last year, accusing officials of denying student loan borrowers their legal rights.\"Thanks to our lawsuit, 20,000 more teachers, nurses, firefighters and public service workers finally got their debt discharged,\" said AFT president Randi Weingarten.'Golden emails' on student loan forgiveness The borrowers deemed eligible for IDR forgiveness in January have not yet had their debts discharged, Education Department officials said in the court filing. The department usually provides borrowers with a short period to opt out of the debt cancellation. \"These people should be getting their notices in February,\" said Nancy Nierman, assistant director of the Education Debt Consumer Assistance Program in New York.\"In fact, we have several clients who got the 'golden email' this month,\" Nierman said, referencing the term some borrowers use to describe the Education Department electronic message confirming their debt cancellation.Backlog remains for affordable repayment plans More than 626,000 federal student loan holders remain stuck in a backlog of applications for an affordable repayment plan, the Education Department reported. Many borrowers rely on IDR plans in order to afford their monthly payments, consumer advocates say.However, the Education Department has made progress on processing the applications: Approximately 734,000 requests were pending in December, compared with nearly 1.4 million in July. However, the PSLF buyback pileup continues to grow, with more than 86,520 borrowers in the queue in January, up from 83,370 in December and 80,210 in November. The buyback option allows borrowers pursuing PSLF to retroactively pay for any months they missed because of a forbearance or deferment, accelerating their timeline to forgiveness. The Education Department said in January it had approved 1,980 buyback applications.

Net income totaled $432 million, or 61 cents per share, up from $267 million, or 38 cents per share a year ago.Palo Alto also said on Tuesday that it's buying Israeli cybersecurity startup Koi to secure AI agents as rising artificial intelligence innovation fuels more sophisticated cyberattacks. The company has bet big on AI tools, and recently launched AI agents to help customers automate certain security responses.The company is also in the midst of a significant spending spree as CEO Nikesh Arora transforms Palo Alto into a hub for all things cybersecurity. Since joining the company in 2018, he's overseen more than 20 acquisitions.Earlier this month, the Santa Clara, California-based company closed its biggest acquisition ever, paying $25 billion for Israeli identity security company CyberArk. In January, it closed the more than $3 billion purchase of cloud observability platform Chronosphere.\"We saw continued strength in platformizations, a trend that is accelerating due to AI - customers are keen to both modernize and normalize their cybersecurity stack, aligning them to our approach,\" Arora wrote in a release. Remaining performance obligations, which track the value of contracts to be delivered to customers, totaled $16 billion and topped a StreetAccount estimate of $15.78 billion.

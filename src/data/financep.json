    "body": "For weeks now, it seems like every few days another major company announces a layoff impacting hundreds, if not thousands, of its employees.These big cuts get a lot of attention, but under the surface another problem is brewing: Smaller-scale firings of less than 50 people are now the most common type of layoff throughout the year, making up 51% of WARN Act notices in 2025 compared with just 38% in 2015.Translation: The \"forever layoff\" is here, according to Glassdoor's latest report on 2026 work trends.These smaller but more regular firings could continue to stoke worker anxiety heading into the next year.Layoffs hit company culture for yearsRolling layoffs could help companies stay out of headlines, researchers note, but \"create cultures of anxiety, insecurity and resentment.\"Previous Glassdoor research found that after a layoff, negative sentiments from remaining employees took more than two years to recover, based on their company ratings. Repeated layoffs have double the impact on employee sentiment right after a second round of cuts, with the biggest drops for key talent, managers and new hires.Another sign of workers' dissatisfaction: Glassdoor ratings of senior leaders have been slipping since the second half of 2023 and are now well below their pandemic peaks.Workers in media and communication; management and consulting; and technology saw the biggest drops in confidence in their leadership. Glassdoor researchers point to AI business disruptions, media consolidations and a return to hustle culture ideals in tech as prime reasons for these declines.Meanwhile, a growing share of users mention words like misalignment, distrust, miscommunication, disconnection and hypocrisy since 2024 in Glassdoor reviews that mention their senior leadership or management.Silver lining for young job-seekersOutside of the layoff forecast, there's good news for some: Wage growth is on the upswing for young workers with up to four years' work experience, giving them more spending power in 2026.New grads have struggled over the last year to jumpstart their careers given the low hiring environment and businesses adopting AI, which has led many to open fewer entry-level roles. But for those who can secure a role, the pay will be better.Young workers in some rising cities will see the biggest difference. Provo, Utah; Boise, Idaho; Orlando, Fla.; Charleston, S.C.; and Austin, Texas are among the locations with the highest wage growth since 2020, according to Glassdoor.\"For early career workers considering where to pursue their next career step, these rising cities represent good opportunities to grow your earnings even though they may not offer the highest salaries,\" Glassdoor researchers wrote.Want to level up your AI skills? Sign up for Smarter by CNBC Make It's new online course, How To Use AI To Communicate Better At Work.

    "body": "Federal student loan borrowers can have their remaining debts forgiven after making payments for 20 or 25 years on income-driven repayment plans. But as of Jan. 1, 2026, that debt forgiveness could come with a massive tax liability that would undercut much of the benefit the forgiveness offers for millions of borrowers, advocates warn.Student debt forgiveness has been exempt from federal income tax since the passage of the American Rescue Plan in 2021. That provision expires at the end of 2025 though, so without a regulatory change, borrowers who receive loan forgiveness through IDR programs will owe federal income tax on amounts forgiven on Jan. 1 and after. A borrower with around $49,321, the average amount of debt forgiven, could see a net loss of $5,800 to over $10,000 in owed taxes and lost credits, according to an analysis by Protect Borrowers, a nonprofit advocacy organization. Those amounts could be even higher if larger debt burdens are forgiven.On Nov. 9, nine Democratic senators, including Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), cited Protect Borrowers' analysis in a letter to Treasury Secretary and acting Internal Revenue Service commissioner Scott Bessent urging the federal government to act now to prevent borrowers from getting hit with this coming \"tax bomb\" by permanently excluding loan forgiveness earned through IDR from federal income taxes.\"By punishing IDR beneficiaries with massive tax bills, the federal government undermines the very purpose of the IDR program and reneges on its promises to borrowers,\" the senators wrote.Who would be impacted mostAnyone who receives loan forgiveness through IDR after Jan. 1, 2026 will have their forgiven amount treated as taxable income, subject to federal income taxes.That tax liability would disproportionately hurt low-income borrowers, Protect Borrowers said in its analysis. That's because those borrowers typically don't have the means to cover an unexpectedly large tax bill if their taxable income significantly increases.About 62% of borrowers who earn loan forgiveness through IDR earn $50,000 a year or less and two-thirds of those borrowers have less than $1,000 in savings, Protect Borrowers wrote, citing Consumer Financial Protection Bureau data.A sizeable increase in taxable income could also affect borrowers' eligibility for tax credits, such as the earned income tax credit, which phases out after certain income thresholds.Borrowers who don't have the assets necessary to cover their tax liability can exclude the forgiven debt from their income under the IRS' insolvency exclusion. But Warren and her fellow senators argue leaving that up to borrowers to figure out and the IRS to determine on a case-by-case basis would be an inadequate solution.Filing the insolvency exclusion is a \"notoriously complex process for taxpayers,\" and approving each individual insolvency case for borrowers would be an \"administrative nightmare\" for the IRS, the senators wrote.The letter requests that the IRS and Treasury Department confirm their intent to make the regulatory change by Nov. 23, 2025.

    "body": "Toyota's battery manufacturing plant in Liberty, North Carolina, US, on Wednesday, Nov. 12, 2025. Allison Joyce | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesToyota Motor on Wednesday said it has started production at a new $13.9 billion battery plant in North Carolina and confirmed plans to invest up to $10 billion more than previously expected over the next five years in the United States.The Japanese automaker did not release details about the increased investment other than Toyota Motor North America CEO Tetsuo Ogawa calling it a \"pivotal moment\" in the company's history along with the new battery plant, according to a release.The facility is Toyota's first in-house battery plant outside of Japan. It was first announced in December 2021 amid the Biden administration's push to onshore production of batteries for hybrids and all-electric vehicles.Since then, market conditions for EVs have soured, while demand for hybrids continues to grow exponentially. Those changes are positive for Toyota, which is the U.S. leader in hybrid sales with a more than 51% market share through the third quarter of this year, according to Motor Intelligence data.It's unclear how much of the investment was already planned but not made previously public, but the announcement follows President Donald Trump last month saying Toyota would invest $10 billion in the U.S.Toyota and the entire automotive industry have been attempting to navigate production plans amid regulatory changes impacting EVs and Trump's litany of tariffs on new vehicles and parts.Toyota's U.S. sales through the third quarter of this year were up 9.9% to more than 1.3 million vehicles sold.",

    "body": "White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt speaks during the daily press briefing in the Brady Press Briefing Room at the White House on Nov. 12, 2025 in Washington, DC. Win McNamee | Getty ImagesKey economic reports for October may not be released at all because of the government shutdown, a senior White House official said Wednesday.With the spending impasse appearing to be near an end, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters that part of the fallout could be lasting damage to the government's data collection ability.\"The Democrats may have permanently damaged the Federal Statistical system with October CPI and jobs reports likely never being released,\" Leavitt said. \"All of that economic data released will be permanently impaired, leaving our policymakers at the Fed, flying blind at a critical period.\"Release of important economic data has been at the forefront of Wall Street concerns as the shutdown dragged on for more than six weeks, the longest in history.Among the most important releases are the monthly nonfarm payrolls count and the consumer price index, both of which come from the Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics. Other data impacted includes retail sales, import and export data as well as consumer spending and income.Most Wall Street economists have been expecting all of the data to be released, albeit delayed. However, Leavitt's comments cast doubt on whether that will happen.\"The Democrat shutdown made it extraordinarily difficult for economists, investors and policymakers at the Federal Reserve to receive critical government data,\" Leavitt said.Leavitt added that the shutdown could lower fourth-quarter economic growth by up to 2 percentage points. Earlier in the afternoon, Kevin Hassett, director of the National Economic Council, said the impasse might shave up to 1.5 percentage points from current-quarter GDP.\"For sure, it's going to have an impact on this quarter,\" Hassett said during an appearance at the Economic Club of Washington, D.C.However, most economists expect the impact to be minimal.Goldman Sachs, in fact, raised its estimates for GDP heading into the end of the year. The firm boosted its Q3 outlook slightly to 3.7% and raised its full-year forecast to 1.3%, a change of 0.3 percentage point.On the issue of data collection, Goldman's economists said they expect the shutdown to have \"a limited impact\" on the quality of jobs data.As for timing, Citigroup economists on Wednesday speculated that the September nonfarm payrolls report could be released as early as Friday but more likely in the early part of next week. They said it could take until early December to put together the October count.Jobs report data should be easy to collect belatedly because it involves asking business for hard numbers, according to Jeffrey Roach, chief economist at LPL Financial. In fact, he said the BLS could likely get multiple months' worth of data during one collection period if needed.But he said it's harder to get information from everyday people because it requires asking them about their willingness to work during a period that has already passed.\"It's just the more nuanced qualitative surveys that cannot be replicated,\" Roach said. \"The water has gone under that bridge already.\"Roach said previous shutdowns have mostly only resulted in delays of the release of data that the government had already collected. But he said this closure lasted long enough to also keep agencies closed during what would have been their collection periods for these reports.— CNBC's Alex Harring contributed.",

    "body": "watch nowAtlanta Federal Reserve President Raphael Bostic said Wednesday he will be leaving his position when his term expires in February.Bostic has been in his current role since June 2017 and is the first Black and openly gay regional president. His term, which also was marked by issues relating to personal investments he made, runs until Feb. 28.\"I'm proud of what we accomplished during my tenure to turn the lofty goal of an economy that works for everyone into more of a reality, and I look forward to discovering new ways to advance that bold vision in my next chapter,\" Bostic said in a statement.The announcement comes ahead of a pivotal year for the Fed and its rate-setting body, the Federal Open Market Committee.Regional presidents serve five-year terms that generally run in sync and are designed to expire on years that end in either 1 or 6, which will be the case next year. While the local boards vote on the presidents, they are subject to approval by the Fed's Board of Governors. Normally a routine process, unusual political dynamics on the board could add a new wrinkle to the procedure.In addition to the reappointments of the regional presidents, Jerome Powell's term as Fed chair expires in May, though his run as governor goes until 2028.Bostic has been seen as more of a centrist during his run, though he's been more cautious about cutting interest rates this year during a time of elevated inflation and a softening labor market. He is not an FOMC voter this year. Atlanta next will get a vote in 2027.Powell said Bostic's \"perspective has enriched the Federal Open Market Committee's understanding of our dynamic economy. And his steady voice has exemplified the best of public service — grounded in analysis, informed by experience, and guided by purpose.\"Until the board names a successor, Cheryl Venable, the first vice president and chief operating officer at the Atlanta Fed, will handle the role of president.Bostic's term has not been without controversy.In October 2022, the Fed announced it was looking at trades Bostic made during blackout periods near policy meetings. An internal report showed there were 154 trades made on his behalf during those times. However, the report also indicated there was no evidence Bostic traded on insider information or had personal conflicts.There also were other issues raised regarding financial disclosure terms and an improper level of Treasury holdings.For his part, Bostic expressed regret over the discrepancies and said the trades were executed by third-party managers over whom he did not have control.The controversy was part of a larger issue with investments from Fed officials that triggered tighter internal controls and rules over what types of securities they are permitted to hold.",

    "body": "watch nowAs food prices climb, Too Good To Go is launching grocery bags with Whole Foods Market, in a major expansion of its push to lessen food waste and provide affordable meals.Too Good To Go is an app that connects users with stores and restaurants that offer surplus food in \"surprise bags\" at significantly lower prices. Its collaboration with Amazon's Whole Foods will expand to all 536 of the grocer's locations across the U.S., where the two companies said they have already saved 1.6 million meals from going to waste through their partnership.Too Good to Go announced seven new categories of surprise bags with Whole Foods on Wednesday: produce, seafood, meat, dry goods, frozen foods, refrigerated foods and floral. Chris MacAulay, vice president of operations for North America at Too Good to Go, said the collaboration is a win for both consumers and the grocer.\"We have this opportunity to bring incremental foot traffic into the store,\" said MacAulay. \"The consumers that come in are getting tremendous value when they pick up a surprise bag, they don't know what they're going to get, but they do know that they're getting incredible food somewhere between 50% to 70% discounted.\"The move is an expansion of an established partnership between the two companies, which previously included prepared foods bags and bakery bags. Shoppers using Too Good to Go will now be able to get fresh groceries at Whole Foods for the first time. MacAulay said the expansion comes as the company focuses on providing affordable meals while consumers navigate rising prices in the grocery aisles and elsewhere.According to the latest consumer price index report, prices in four of the six major grocery store food groups increased in September. Prices for staples like meats, poultry and eggs rose 5.2% over the year prior to that data release, while fruits and vegetables saw a 1.3% increase. More recent inflation data has been delayed by the government shutdown.Because of the lapse in federal funding, 42 million Americans saw their SNAP benefits paused as a battle played out in the courts about whether the government is required to pay that aid to largely lower-income households.Companies are also seeing a more divided economy, as non-wealthy consumers pull back on their spending on non-essential items and look for ways to save.\"I think we're especially starting to see a great deal of bifurcation around different consumer segments,\" MacAulay said. \"It's hard to put great food on the table, it's getting more expensive, and as a result, finding ways to get some of that food at a better value is really important. And so we're not going to be the only solution – I think we're excited about being a part of a solution to help families who are facing economic challenges.\"The new surprise bags, targeting consumer essentials like produce and poultry, are each valued between $21 and $30, but priced at $6.99 to $9.99.It's part of a larger goal from Whole Foods to deliver on sustainability promises, according to Caitlin Leibert, the grocery chain's vice president of sustainability. She said the company has already seen high demand for its existing Too Good To Go bags and is increasingly seeing customers come in to pick up their bags and make additional purchases on the side because of the overall savings.\"This is really an incredible opportunity and added tool for Americans to stretch every dollar further right now, which we know is so important,\" Leibert said. \"This is one way that you can access higher quality food at a more affordable price.\"Whole Foods isn't immune from the macroeconomic headwinds, either, Leibert said – but the collaboration with Too Good To Go allows the grocery chain to find alternate ways to make its products affordable and accessible for shoppers.Still, both Leibert and MacAulay said the new grocery bags are just one step in a longer path toward promoting sustainability and providing affordable meals.\"We do not 'achieve' sustainability – it is a constant evolution of growth and improvement,\" Leibert said. \"These programs... [are] such a profound way and accessible way to make an impact easily.\"",

Benjamin Fanjoy | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesGoogle filed a lawsuit Wednesday against a foreign cybercriminal group behind a massive SMS phishing, or \"smishing,\" operation.Dubbed by some cyber researchers as the \"Smishing Triad,\" the organization, which Google said is largely based out of China, uses a phishing-as-a-service kit named \"Lighthouse\" to create and deploy attacks using fraudulent texts.The crime group has amassed more than a million victims across 120 countries, Google said in a release.\"They were preying on users' trust in reputable brands such as E-ZPass, the U.S. Postal Service, and even us as Google,\" Google general counsel Halimah DeLaine Prado told CNBC. \"The 'Lighthouse' enterprise or software creates a bunch of templates in which you create fake websites to pull users' information.\"Google brought claims under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations, or RICO, Act, the Lanham Act, and the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, or CFAA, and is seeking to dismantle the group and the Lighthouse platform.The texts usually contain malicious links to a fake website designed to steal victims' sensitive financial information, including Social Security numbers, banking credentials and more.The messages can often appear in the form of a fake fraud alert, delivery update, unpaid government fee notification, or other seemingly urgent texts.The crime group has stolen approximately between 12.7 million and 115 million credit cards in the U.S. alone, Google said.\"The idea is to prevent its continued proliferation, deter others from doing something similarly, as well as protect both the users and brands that were misused in these websites from future harm,\" DeLaine Prado said.Read more CNBC tech newsAI spending is not all equal.

    "body": "A power substation near the LC1 CloudHQ data center in Ashburn, Virginia, on March 27, 2024.Nathan Howard | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesVoter anger at surging electricity prices is fueling political backlash against the artificial intelligence industry's data centers, with Democrats accusing the Trump administration of failing to address the issue as they zero in on affordability ahead of next year's mid-term elections.Abigail Spanberger won last week's governor's race in Virginia, home to the largest concentration of data centers in the world, after promising to make the industry \"pay their own way and their fair share\" of rising electricity costs.New Jersey governor-elect Mikie Sherrill has promised to declare a state of emergency over electric bills on her first day in office and freeze prices in the Garden State. Two Democrats were elected to Georgia's commission that regulates utilities, breaking total Republican control, with one of the candidates arguing that prices are rising in the Peach State in part due to data centers.On the heels of the election victories, Democratic senators in Washington led by Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut and Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont took aim this week at what they described as the White House's \"sweetheart deals with Big Tech companies,\" accusing the administration of failing to protect consumers from \"being forced to subsidize the cost of data centers.\"\"As a result, everyday Americans are already being forced into bidding wars with trillion-dollar companies to keep the lights on at home,\" the senators wrote Monday in a letter demanding solutions from the White House.President Donald Trump promised to cut families' electric bills by 50% in his first year in office. But residential prices in the U.S. increased about an average 6% in August nationwide compared to the same-period in 2024, according to October data from the Energy Information Administration. Prices soared about 21% in New Jersey, 13% in Virginia and about 5% in Georgia in the same period.The reasons for price hikes vary by state and region, said Abraham Silverman, who served as general counsel for New Jersey's public utility board from 2019 until 2023 under outgoing Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy.But data centers are playing the main role in rising bills on the PJM Interconnection electric grid that serves New Jersey and Virginia, Silverman said. PJM is the largest grid in the U.S., reaching more than 65 million people across 13 states in the Mid-Atlantic and parts of the Midwest and South.\"We are basically adding a Philadelphia's worth of new electricity users to the grid every year, starting in 2025 and showing no signs of slowing,\" Silverman said of the national increase in demand. \"Where is that load growth coming from? The answer is data centers.\"Surging pricesThe conditions that led to surging household electricity prices this year, particularly in the PJM region, took root before the second Trump administration entered office, when investment in AI data centers was just starting to ramp up.The amount PJM agreed to pay in late 2022 to secure capacity from power plants, which ensures they are available when electricity use rises, totaled $2.2 billion. In 2024, the bill soared more than 500% to $14.7 billion. This year, it jumped another 9% to $16.1 billion.The independent watchdog that monitors PJM found the main culprit for soaring capacity prices: data centers.\"The current conditions in the capacity market are almost entirely the result of large load additions from data centers, both actual historical and forecast,\" the watchdog Monitoring Analytics concluded in its independent market monitor report published in June.Those capacity prices are ultimately passed down to household electricity bills, Silverman said. \"It is an extremely large component of the affordability crisis we're experiencing right now.\"New Jersey utility PSE&G, owned by Public Service Enterprise Group, acknowledged the impact of exploding capacity prices in a February letter to consumers warning of a 17% increase in their bills, though it didn't call out data centers.\"Utilities do not earn a profit on the electric supply; these costs are passed through directly to customers,\" the company said.The problem could get worse as the data center build out accelerates — at least for now. Power used by data centers in advanced stages of planning in Pennsylvania, for example, jumped more than 40% to 20.5 gigawatts in the third quarter, up from 14.4 gigawatts previously, according to the utility PPL. That's equivalent to the power consumption of about 17 million U.S. homes.\"I want to be clear that these load additions are real, they are coming fast and furious,\" PPL CEO Vincent Sorgi said on its latest earnings call. \"The bottom line is that we need to start building new generation as soon as possible.\"It is unlikely that residential utility bills will come down this decade as demand is expected to remain high and supplies tight, said Rob Gramlich, president of Grid Strategies, a power sector consulting firm.Political blame gameThe Democratic senators accused the Trump administration of making the affordability problem worse with its attacks on renewable energy. Trump has tried to halt the expansion of wind power, particularly offshore wind projects, and his signature piece of domestic legislation, the One Big Beautiful Bill, phases out tax credits for renewable energy.Renewables are the most readily available source of generation to meet new demand, with solar, battery storage and wind making up more than 90% of the projects that are waiting to connect to the grid, according to August data from the consulting firm Enverus. Sherrill and Spanberger campaigned on expanding renewable energy in New Jersey and Virginia not to lower carbon emissions, but to help bring down energy costs.The White House blames the Biden administration and its renewable energy policies for driving up electricity prices. Trump \"declared an energy emergency to reverse four years of Biden's disastrous policies, accelerate large-scale grid infrastructure projects, and expedite the expansion of coal, natural gas and nuclear power generation,\" White House spokeswoman Taylor Rogers said in a statement.The AI industry should pay for the new generation and transmission that is needed to support their data centers, Silverman said. \"If we do that, then we are really going a long way to insulate mom and pop consumers from the higher costs,\" he said.The Data Center Coalition, a lobbying group, said in a statement that \"the industry is committed to paying its full cost of service for the energy it uses.\"",

Aaron Schwartz | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesThe Supreme Court said Wednesday that it will hear oral arguments in the case challenging President Donald Trump's authority to fire Federal Reserve Gov. Lisa Cook on Jan. 21.Trump said on Aug. 25 that he was firing Cook, one of seven Fed governors, citing claims that she committed mortgage fraud in connection with two residences that she owns.Cook, who denies any wrongdoing, filed a lawsuit seeking to block her removal.A federal district court judge in Washington, D.C., in early September ruled that Cook could not be fired from the board while her suit was pending. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia soon after upheld that ruling, leading Trump to ask the Supreme Court to rule on his power to fire her.Read more CNBC politics coverageDemocrats win big on Election Night in key racesZohran Mamdani wins New York City mayor's race, NBC News projectsDemocratic candidate Mikie Sherrill wins New Jersey governor's race, NBC News projectsDemocrats win Virginia governor, attorney general races, NBC News projectsSNAP update: Trump admin will pay 50% of food stamp benefits in November amid shutdownTrump says he has 'no idea who' Binance's CZ is after pardoning himTrump backtracks on attending Supreme Court tariffs case argumentsIn the initial ruling blocking Cook's removal, District Court Judge Jia Cobb wrote, \"Cook has made a strong showing that her purported removal was done in violation of the Federal Reserve Act's 'for cause' provision.\"\"The best reading\" of that provision is that legal cause for removing a Fed governor is limited to actions related to their \"behavior in office,\" Cobb wrote.The allegations against Cook relate to conduct that predates her serving on the Fed.Solicitor General D. John Sauer, who is representing the Trump administration in the case, has argued in a filing with the Supreme Court that the president should be allowed to remove her while her suit is pending because she does not have \"a Fifth Amendment property interest in her continued service as a Governor of the Federal Reserve System.\"Sauer also wrote that although the Federal Reserve Act rules out removal for \"no reason at all, or for policy disagreement ... so long as the President identifies a cause, the determination of 'some cause relating to the conduct, ability, fitness, or competence of the officer' is within the President's unreviewable discretion.\"Trump tried to fire Cook, who is the first Black woman to serve on the Fed's Board of Governors, after months of unsuccessfully pressuring the board and Fed Chair Jerome Powell to lower interest rates.",

Volume was 31% higher than the same week one year ago.This came despite the fact that the average contract interest rate for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages with conforming loan balances, $806,500 or less, increased to 6.34% from 6.31%, with points rising to 0.62 from 0.58, including the origination fee, for loans with a 20% down payment. That rate is 52 basis points lower than it was one year ago.\"Purchase applications for conventional, FHA, and VA loans increased, as potential homebuyers continue to shop around, particularly in markets where inventory has increased and sales price growth has slowed.

Brendan Smialowski | Afp | Getty ImagesTwo European pioneers of the modern wind power industry are sounding the alarm on the Trump administration's clean energy cutbacks, warning Washington's anti-climate agenda is part of a broader energy transition challenge.Denmark's Henrik Stiesdal and Britain's Andrew Garrad, often referred to as the \"Godfathers of wind\" for their contributions in advancing the design, manufacture and deployment of wind turbines, said Trump's war on wind appears to be a symptom of more widespread climate apathy.Stiesdal is known for framing the early design principles for wind turbines and led the installation of the world's first offshore wind farm in 1991, while Garrad developed computer models to optimize and certify turbine and farm designs.\"I think Trump's approach is symptomatic of a general shift,\" Garrad said, in comments echoed by Stiesdal, one that is opposed to the transition from fossil fuels to renewable technologies, such as wind and solar.\"We are facing right now, a change of mood. We had a very easy beginning, then quite a big struggle, then general acceptance, and now the worm is turning. And that's something which we all have to address,\" Garrad told CNBC.Read moreSince returning to office at the start of the year, U.S. President Donald Trump has actively sought to disrupt the development of high-profile wind projects. His push to wipe out the offshore wind industry has included stop-work orders and the removal of green incentives under former President Joe Biden's Inflation Reduction Act.\"Trump is symptomatic. I mean an extreme symptom of that, but you can see it I think in all Western countries certainly, perhaps not elsewhere. And that's a big issue,\" Garrad said.\"This isn't just a wind energy problem,\" Garrad said. \"To do this sort of change is a very dangerous thing. And I think it has shown that this is a political business ... It's a personal decision by a politician, who happens to be a rather powerful one — and it has sent shockwaves around the place.\"'Pathetic' and 'expensive'Trump's onslaught against the wind industry has hit the business models of renewable energy giants particularly hard. Denmark's Ortsed, the world's biggest offshore wind farm group, is one notable example.Last week, Orsted reported a net loss of 1.7 billion Danish kroner ($261.8 million) for the July-September period. The result, which was slightly better than analysts feared, was significantly down from profit of 5.17 billion Danish kroner in the same period last year.Shares of the Copenhagen-listed company, which have fallen more than 80% from a 2021 peak, notched a fresh record low in August after the Trump administration ordered the company to halt work on a near complete windfarm.A turbine blade is lifted onto a rack near tower sections at the Revolution Wind project assembly site at State Pier in New London, Connecticut, US, on Friday, Oct. 24, 2025.Bloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesDanish wind turbine firm Vestas has also been battling industry uncertainty, in part because of the Trump administration's policies. When asked about some of these challenges, Vestas CEO Henrik Andersen said the company has a \"well-established\" supply chain in the U.S.\"For us, we see the U.S., both customers and the buildout in the U.S., as some of our core responsibility to help the U.S. with,\" Andersen told CNBC's \"Squawk Box Europe\" on Nov. 5.\"Then sometimes maybe we have to get a bit of a slap that it is not everyone that likes the nature of a wind turbine. But I think, in general, … energy drives decision making and [the] cost of energy drives decision making,\" he added.U.S. President Donald Trump speaks during the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) at the United Nations headquarters on September 23, 2025 in New York City.Michael M. Santiago | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesTrump has repeatedly criticized the deployment of offshore wind turbines, describing them as \"pathetic\" and \"expensive\" in a recent speech at the United Nations General Assembly.\"I'm telling you that if you don't get away from the green energy scam, your country is going to fail,\" Trump said on Sept. 23. The U.S. president also said climate change is the \"greatest con job ever perpetrated on the world.\"Scientists have since condemned Trump's characterization of climate change, pointing out that the overwhelming consensus is that climate change is already happening, with record-breaking heatwaves, flood events and hurricanes causing substantial economic damages across the globe.Energy securityStiesdal, who refused to comment specifically on Trump's war on wind, said there appears to be \"a fundamental misunderstanding\" from those firmly opposed to the energy transition.\"A lot of people who would be inclined to vote for hard-right parties actually benefit both from the job offerings and the cost of their energy from renewables,\" Stiesdal said.\"It's not an easy thing to fight because a lot of it is kind of visceral or fundamental in the thinking about this tribal approach,\" he continued. \"Whenever I am confronted with that, or with discussions about that, I try to emphasize energy security, the job creation, the local beneficial effects of doing renewables and the assurances you get in society.\"King Charles III (centre) poses for a group photo after presenting the 2024 Queen Elizabeth Prize for Engineering to Andrew Garrad C.B.E.

The actual vote on the bill to fund the government will probably come later, around 7 o'clock,\" the House majority leader told CNBC. \"There'll be, I'm sure, a good, thorough debate, but it's so important that this gets done.\"If the spending bill gets through as planned, it will end an impasse that has lasted more than six weeks, resulting in furloughs for government workers, the closing of all federal government activities, the suspension of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program and increased delays at airports heading into the holiday travel season.The Senate on Monday approved the package, which would keep the government open until Jan. 30 and provide funding for agriculture, military programs and legislative agencies, while also providing back pay for workers affected by the shutdown.Read more CNBC politics coverageDemocrats win big on Election Night in key racesZohran Mamdani wins New York City mayor's race, NBC News projectsDemocratic candidate Mikie Sherrill wins New Jersey governor's race, NBC News projectsDemocrats win Virginia governor, attorney general races, NBC News projectsSNAP update: Trump admin will pay 50% of food stamp benefits in November amid shutdownTrump says he has 'no idea who' Binance's CZ is after pardoning himTrump backtracks on attending Supreme Court tariffs case argumentsPresident Donald Trump has indicated he will sign the bill into law.Though the majority in the House is expected to be razor thin, Scalise said he expects to peel off enough Democrats to get the package through.\"Some Democrats still want to play games and inflict pain on families across America, but we've got enough,\" he said. \"We may get a few more than that in the House who want to end this madness and just let people get back to their lives.\"Both sides have traded blame over who is responsible for the shutdown. Polls have indicated voters more put the onus on Republicans, though an NBC News poll earlier this month showed Democrats faulted at the highest level in 30 years when compared with previous shutdowns.\"It's madness, but it's going to end today, hopefully, and let's move on,\" Scalise said.",

    "body": "Portrait of American financier Jeffrey Epstein, left, and Donald Trump as they pose together at the Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Florida, in 1997.Davidoff Studios Photography | Archive Photos | Getty ImagesNotorious sex offender Jeffrey Epstein said of President Donald Trump, \"I know how dirty donald is,\" in a 2018 email thread about Trump's former personal lawyer and fixer Michael Cohen having pleaded guilty to campaign finance violations and agreed to cooperate in a federal investigation of the president.Epstein made that remark about Trump to Kathryn Ruemmler, a lawyer who served as White House counsel under former President Barack Obama. Ruemmler is currently chief legal officer and general counsel at Goldman Sachs.The email thread, which CNBC has not independently verified, is among more than 20,000 documents obtained from Epstein's estate by Democrats on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, which released them on Wednesday.Ruemmler on Aug. 23, 2018, emailed Epstein a link to a New York Times op-ed by Bret Stephens, which had the headline, \"Donald Trump's High Crimes and Misdemeanors: The principled case for impeachment is clear. What's missing is the courage.\"The article detailed Cohen's guilty plea and its implications for Trump, who was then in his first term in the White House. Cohen had pleaded guilty to crimes related to making and facilitating hush money payments to porn star Stormy Daniels and Playboy model Karen McDougal before the 2016 presidential election.\"I thought you'd find interesting,\" Ruemmler wrote Epstein, who had been friends with Trump for years before they had a falling out in the early 2000s.She wrote in the same thread, \"It makes no difference whether it was his money. Issue is failure to disclose. Plus, fact that he lied his ass off about it makes it clear that he knew it was illegal.\"Epstein replied, \"You see, I know how dirty donald is.\"\"My guess is that non lawyers ny biz people have no idea. what it means to have your fixer flip,\" Epstein added.Read more CNBC politics coverageDemocrats win big on Election Night in key racesZohran Mamdani wins New York City mayor's race, NBC News projectsDemocratic candidate Mikie Sherrill wins New Jersey governor's race, NBC News projectsDemocrats win Virginia governor, attorney general races, NBC News projectsSNAP update: Trump admin will pay 50% of food stamp benefits in November amid shutdownTrump says he has 'no idea who' Binance's CZ is after pardoning himTrump backtracks on attending Supreme Court tariffs case argumentsIn a separate April 2019 email released by House Democrats, Epstein wrote author Michael Wolff that Trump \"knew about the girls,\" according to a copy of that message purportedly between the two men.It is unclear what the phrase \"knew about the girls\" meant.In another newly released email that Epstein wrote to his now-convicted accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell in April 2011, Epstein wrote, \"I want you to realize that the dog that hasn't barked is trump.\"Epstein added in that same email that a person whom the Democrats identified as a victim of his, whose name was redacted in the email, \"spent hours at my house with\" Trump.\"He has never once been mentioned,\" Epstein added in that message.It is not clear what Epstein was referring to in the email that said \"the dog that hasn't barked.\"In an email exchange in December 2015, when Trump was seeking the Republican nomination for the White House, Wolff wrote Epstein, \"I hear CNN planning to ask Trump tonight about his relationship with you -- either on air or in scrum afterwards.\"Epstein replied, \"if we were able to craft an answer for him, what do you think it should be?\"Wolff answered: \"I think you should let him hang himself. If he says he hasn't been on the plane or to the house, then that gives you a valuable PR and political currency.\"\"You can hang him in a way that potentially generates a positive benefit for you, or, if it really looks like he could win, you could save him, generating a debt,\" Wolff added. \"Of course, it is possible that, when asked, he'll say Jeffrey is a great guy and has gotten a raw deal and is a victim of political correctness, which is to be outlawed in a Trump regime.\"Trump has denied that he knew about Epstein's sexual abuse of underage girls and women. The president has never been charged with wrongdoing in connection with Epstein.The release came two days after Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee issued a statement saying, \"Whistleblower information provided to the Committee also indicates that Ghislaine Maxwell is working on filing a 'Commutation Application' with the Trump Administration.\"Maxwell is serving a 20-year prison sentence for crimes related to procuring underage girls to be abused by Epstein.White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt, in a statement on Wednesday, said, \"The Democrats selectively leaked emails to the liberal media to create a fake narrative to smear President Trump.\"\"The 'unnamed victim' referenced in these emails is the late Virginia Giuffre, who repeatedly said President Trump was not involved in any wrongdoing whatsoever and 'couldn't have been friendlier' to her in their limited interactions,\" Leavitt said.\"The fact remains that President Trump kicked Jeffrey Epstein out of his club decades ago for being a creep to his female employees, including Giuffre,\" Leavitt said.\"These stories are nothing more than bad-faith efforts to distract from President Trump's historic accomplishments, and any American with common sense sees right through this hoax and clear distraction from the government opening back up again.\"Giuffre died by suicide in April.CNBC has requested comment from Maxwell's attorney about the emails.Epstein, 66, killed himself in a Manhattan jail in August 2019, weeks after he was arrested on federal child sex trafficking charges.Scores of women have said Epstein sexually abused them when they were underage girls or young women.Democrats on the House Oversight Committee said the emails that they obtained raise \"serious questions\" about Trump's involvement with Epstein.The three emails related to Trump are among thousands written by Epstein and obtained by the Democrats.\"The more Donald Trump tries to cover up the Epstein files, the more we uncover. These latest emails and correspondence raise glaring questions about what else the White House is hiding and the nature of the relationship between Epstein and the President,\" said Rep. Robert Garcia, a California Democrat who is the ranking member of the House Oversight Committee.\"The Department of Justice must fully release the Epstein files to the public immediately,\" Garcia said. \"The Oversight Committee will continue pushing for answers and will not stop until we get justice for the victims.\" Trump and the DOJ have been criticized for months for reneging on promises by Trump administration officials to release criminal investigative files about Epstein.Trump said in July that he threw Epstein out of his Mar-a-Lago club in Florida and cut ties with him years ago because \"he stole people who worked for me.\"Trump said that Epstein had poached at least one more Mar-a-Lago worker from him after being warned not to do that again.The president has repeatedly called demands that officials release the so-called Epstein files \"a Democratic hoax.\"— CNBC's Ashlee Trujillo and Laya Neelakandan contributed to this story.This is developing news.

    "body": "Howard Marks, co-founder of Oaktree Capital Group, at the Qatar Economic Forum (QEF) in Doha, Qatar, on Wednesday, May 21, 2025.Bloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesVeteran investor Howard Marks has warned that cracks unearthed in the credit market demonstrate investor \"complacency\" and \"carelessness\" — but stopped short of calling the turmoil a broader systemic problem.In his latest memo to clients, the co-founder and co-chairman of Oaktree Capital Management discussed the high-profile bankruptcies of U.S. car parts supplier First Brands and subprime auto lender Tricolor. Marks also highlighted problems at Zions Bancorp, Western Alliance, Broadband Telecom and Bridgevoice, and the role played by complex lending arrangements.Following the First Brands and Tricolor collapses, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon warned that \"when you see one cockroach, there are probably more.\"Marks, however, does not view the troubles as evidence of a broader systemic malaise within sub-investment grade debt, or the wider private credit markets.\"If one is an isolated instance, and two hint at a pattern, are six an ominous trend?,\" Marks said in a memo published Nov. 6. \"The truth is that there are always defaults … It shouldn't come as a surprise if there are a few dozen defaults in a normal year.\"Instead, the events offer a reminder that higher-yielding credit spreads simply reflect the greater risk attached to lower-rated debt, according to the 79-year-old value investor.Marks said rising markets typically bring greater risk tolerance, fear of missing out and lapses in due diligence, which help create \"fertile soil\" for potential wrongdoing.When earnings and profits are up, negativity is \"easily brushed aside\" and \"the possibility of loss recedes from consciousness\" as investors look to capitalize on the market upswing. Conversely, during a downturn, \"it's the negatives that are exaggerated and the positives that are ignored\" as the pendulum swings back and risk aversion outweighs risk tolerance.\"The key observation is that good times lead to complacency, risk tolerance, and carelessness, as people bid aggressively for assets and compete to make loans. And then, bad times expose the results of that carelessness, as investments that were entered into without an adequate investigation and margin for error fail to hold up in a hostile environment,\" he wrote.watch nowThe rapid demise of First Brands in September drew in financial services firms on both sides of the Atlantic, including Jefferies subsidiary Leucadia Asset Management and UBS O'Connor, the alternative investment unit of UBS.Marks highlighted several red flags underpinning First Brands' implosion, including extensive litigation history, $5 billion of annual sales in just six years of operating history, and \"byzantine\" funding agreements across a complex network of corporate entities and subsidiaries. Bankruptcy filings show First Brands' total obligations stand at $11.6 billion, nearly double the $5.9 billion disclosed earlier this year, Marks said.\"I don't think today's issues are systemic in the sense that there's something wrong with the lending system, or that they will trigger other defaults and lead to a breakdown of the system,\" he said.\"In simpler words, there's nothing wrong with the plumbing ... people who make investments and loans are highly prone to error in good times.\"",

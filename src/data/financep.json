    "description": "For the 2025 tax year, eligible U.S. taxpayers can deduct up to $10,000 in auto loan interest under a temporary provision enacted as part of President",
    "body": "For the 2025 tax year, eligible U.S. taxpayers can deduct up to $10,000 in auto loan interest under a temporary provision enacted as part of President Donald Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill Act.However, most eligible borrowers will deduct far less, largely because even sizable auto loans don't generate anywhere near $10,000 in interest in a single year. That figure is closer to what borrowers typically pay in total interest over the life of a 72-month new-car loan, per Edmunds, a car-shopping and automotive data company.Instead, for most borrowers, the deduction is more likely to provide tax savings measured in hundreds of dollars a year, not thousands, according to automotive research firm Cox Automotive. Eligibility rules further narrow who can claim the deduction, since it applies only to newly purchased vehicles financed after Dec. 31, 2024, excludes foreign-assembled cars and phases out for higher earners.\"This tax credit is limited, won't be a market mover and is not a tool to substantially address the affordability challenges and high interest rates our market faces,\" Jeremy Robb, chief economist at Cox Automotive, tells CNBC Make It.Who qualifies for the auto loan interest deductionThe auto loan interest deduction was a 2024 campaign pledge by Trump, enacted starting July 4, 2025 as part of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. The deduction itself is temporary and applies only to tax years 2025 through 2028.The deduction applies only to loans that meet the following requirements, per the Internal Revenue Service:The loan must have originated after Dec. 31, 2024 and be secured by the vehicle.The vehicle must be new — loans for used vehicles do not qualify.The vehicle must be for personal use, not business or commercial use.Eligible vehicles include cars, minivans, vans, SUVs, pickup trucks and motorcycles with a gross vehicle weight rating under 14,000 pounds.The vehicle must have undergone final assembly in the United States. That's roughly 50% of vehicles sold in the U.S., according to Cox.  The $10,000 maximum deduction phases out at higher income levels. For single filers, the phaseout begins at $100,000 of modified adjusted gross income and ends at $150,000. For married couples filing jointly, the phaseout begins at $200,000 and ends at $250,000, per the IRS.While eligibility is limited by income and vehicle rules, qualifying taxpayers can claim the break whether they itemize deductions or take the standard deduction.Why most buyers won't get close to $10,000Even among those who qualify, few buyers are likely to see their tax bill reduced by anything close to $10,000.A 72-month new-car loan with an interest rate of 9.5% on a $48,000 vehicle and a 12.5% down payment would generate roughly $3,800 in interest in the first year, according to analysis from Cox Automotive. Interest costs fall to about $3,200 in the second year and roughly $2,600 in the third year.While the full amount of interest is deductible, it only reduces the portion of income subject to tax, not taxes owed dollar for dollar. As a result, the actual tax savings are smaller than the interest paid.Assuming a federal tax rate of about 15% to 20% for new-vehicle buyers, the first-year deduction would translate into less than $750 in tax savings, according to Cox Automotive calculations. In the second year, the savings would fall to about $640 as interest costs decline.It would take a loan of roughly $112,000 to generate $10,000 in deductible interest in the first year alone, says Robb.How to claim the deduction on your tax returnThe deduction is claimed on Schedule 1-A, an updated attachment to Form 1040, which tax software will complete automatically for most filers.Taxpayers must include the vehicle identification number, or VIN, on their tax return for any year the deduction is claimed. The VIN is a 17-character number typically visible on the driver's side of the dashboard near the windshield or inside the driver's door frame, and it also appears on vehicle documents such as the title or insurance card. Buyers can use the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's VIN Decoder, which identifies a vehicle's assembly plant, to confirm whether it was finally assembled in the United States.Lenders must provide borrowers with a statement showing the total amount of interest paid on a qualifying vehicle loan.Want to improve your communication, confidence and success at work?

    "body": "When U.S. figure skaters Amber Glenn, Alysa Liu and Isabeau Levito take to the ice to compete at the Milano Cortina Winter Olympics, they all wear dresses designed by the same woman.The designer's name is Lisa McKinnon, and she's outfitted all three women competing for Team USA in singles figure skating events, plus two American ice dancers and two South Korean skaters at these Olympics. Collectively, the seven athletes are set to compete in at least 13 costumes from Lisa McKinnon Designs, a Los Angeles-based studio that McKinnon launched in 2014.McKinnon works between 40 and 60 hours per week, regardless of the season, she tells CNBC Make It. She and her five employees handmade nearly 700 costumes, for skaters across every discipline and level, in 2025, she estimates. The business charges $90 per hour, and its custom costumes for high-level skaters typically cost between $4,000 and $8,000 apiece, she says. (McKinnon declined to share the business's total annual revenue.)DON'T MISS: How to read people and master your body language to be more influential at workMost clients, regardless of their desired final product, have to request costumes at least six months in advance, and McKinnon's team often works on a costume up until the deadline, she says. The timeline is largely due to demand, and to budget time for costume emergencies or special requests.One such special request: In December, Liu — the reigning world champion — asked McKinnon to design her a new dress for her Lady Gaga-themed program at the 2026 U.S. Figure Skating Championships in early January. McKinnon finished the dress in a hotel room in St. Louis on the day Liu competed in the costume, the designer says.\"I really care so much about every single project that I do. A little blood, sweat and tears are a totally common thing for me, [though] I don't cry as much [these days]\" says McKinnon, 47.Skating is 'in my blood'McKinnon, born and raised in Sweden, grew up a figure skater and made her first competition costume for herself at age 15. She didn't have any crystals, which are commonly glued onto skating dresses, so she hand-sewed paillettes — sequins secured onto the fabric with tiny beads, she says.She began making costumes for other skaters later that year, after a request from a member of the Swedish national team, she says. But mostly, she pursued her own skating career — eventually performing in professional shows like Disney On Ice for eight years, then working on them as a performance director for another eight years, she says.McKinnon started spending her summers between shows in the U.S. starting in 2006, and after leaving the skating world, pursued jobs supervising costume departments in Las Vegas and then Los Angeles. In 2013, she was the costume supervisor at The Wallis Annenberg Center for the Performing Arts in Beverly Hills, California, when an old friend — who was a skating coach at a local rink — asked if she'd design a costume for a student, she says.The dress was eye-catching enough for other local parents and athletes to start coming to McKinnon, she says. She quit her job in late 2014 to launch her business, she says, and has since built a reputation for making costumes that add storytelling to each individual skating routine's theme.Within a year, some of the country's top stars living in or near Los Angeles, home to multiple high-level skating coaches, were competing in her costumes. One early Los Angeles-based client, Ashley Wagner, was already a multi-time U.S. national champion when she started working with McKinnon. Another, Karen Chen, later competed in multiple Olympic Games, winning a gold medal in the team event at the 2022 Winter Olympics.McKinnon vividly remembers the first time she saw her designs on national television, she says: Wagner and Chen wore them on the podium after winning silver and gold at the 2017 U.S. National Figure Skating Championships.\"I drank a lot of champagne and I definitely shed some tears,\" says McKinnon.Her business is small, relative to its demand. To keep up, McKinnon arrives early in the morning to do paperwork and often stays late to tidy up, tossing scraps of fabric and reorganizing crystals, she says. Competitive skating and costume designing both require determination, resilience and ambition, she adds.\"I'm really competitive. I want to do the things I'm good at, and I want to be the best,\" says McKinnon, adding: \"Once you've skated, it's always going to be a part of your life somehow. It sticks with you. It's always been part of my life and I feel like it's in my blood.\"Want to improve your communication, confidence and success at work?

    "body": "Sultan Ahmed Bin Sulayem of Dubai speaks at a news conference on Nov. 10, 2005 in New York City. Mario Tama | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesThe CEO of Dubai's largest port has been replaced by the company after details of his past relationship with the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein were made public.On Friday, DP World announced in a statement that it had appointed Essa Kazim as chairman of its board of directors and Yuvraj Narayan as group chief executive officer, replacing Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem.The U.S. Department of Justice's latest release of files related to Epstein revealed that the financier once referred to Sulayem as a \"close personal friend\" and called him one of his most trusted friends in other files. Sulayem has not been accused of any criminal wrongdoing. A disclosure to Nasdaq Dubai, where DP World maintains listed bonds, said Sulayem had resigned \"effective immediately.\"Sulayem was at the helm of Dubai's largest port operator as chairman since 2007 and CEO since 2016.The statement made no mention of Sulayem but said the company \"affirmed that the new appointments support its strategy for sustainable growth and reinforce its role in strengthening global supply chains and supporting Dubai's position as a leading hub for trade and logistics.\"CNBC sought comment from Sulayem through DP World, where he served as chairman and CEO, but did not receive a response.Kazim was most recently the governor of the DIFC, Dubai's financial center. Narayan was deputy CEO and CFO at DP World since 2005. Sulayem is one of Dubai's most prominent business figures, coming from one of the Emirate's main families. His father was an advisor to the ruling Al Maktoum family and Sulayem played a key role in the ascendance of Dubai as an economic hub.Sulayem oversaw the growth of Dubai's Jebel Ali port into a major deep-water shipping hub and the expansion of DP World into an international logistics empire that now oversees ports handling a tenth of the world's container trade.He also led Nakheel Properties, a Dubai government-owned developer, though he was replaced amid a major board restructuring following Dubai World's debt issues during the 2008 financial crisis. A 'close personal friend' of Epstein The extent of Sulayem's relationship with Epstein emerged in recent weeks following the release of the latest files.The records show the Emirati businessman was in contact with Epstein after the financier was convicted of soliciting prostitution from a minor in 2008. Authorities have stressed that a mention in the Epstein files does not indicate evidence of wrongdoing nor prove that the name was part of a purported client list or blackmail scheme.Jeffrey Epstein and Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem, Group CEO of DP World.House Oversight Committee Democrats Pressure from DP World's partnersThis week, pressure mounted on Sulayem to resign after international partners paused new deals with DP World, calling for the company to take the \"required action.\" Canada's second-largest pension fund, La Caisse, which has invested more than $5 billion alongside DP World over the past decade, said it would pause \"additional capital deployment alongside the company.\"In a statement sent to CNBC, La Caisse said it was \"important to distinguish the company, DP World, from the individual, Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem, who is the focus of the current situation.\"\"On that point, we have made it clear to the company that we expect it to shed light on the situation and take the necessary actions,\" the pension fund added. A spokesperson for British International Investment, which invests with DP World in four African ports, said it would also pause new investments.\"In light of the allegations, we will not be making any new investments with DP World until the required actions have been taken by the company.\"",

    "body": "US President Donald Trump holds a bilateral meeting with European Commission President Ursula Von der Leyen on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly in New York City on September 23, 2025. Brendan Smialowski | Afp | Getty ImagesEurope is \"totally on the sidelines\" on the global stage as \"wrecking ball\" politics has become the norm, the head of the continent's biggest security forum has said. Speaking to CNBC's Annette Weisbach ahead of the Munich Security Conference (MSC), Wolfgang Ischinger, the organization's chairman, said it was Europe's \"own fault\" that its power on the global stage has been diminished. \"Europe has failed to speak with one voice to China and about China, Europe has failed with one voice, to come up with a clear concept about the future of the Middle East, including about how to deal or not to deal with the Iranian nuclear question,\" said Ischinger, who is a former German ambassador to the U.S. Earlier this week, the MSC published its 2026 report, for which Ischinger wrote the foreword. It warned that \"the world has entered a period of wrecking-ball politics,\" where \"sweeping destruction … is the order of the day.\"The report said that U.S President Donald Trump was \"at the forefront of those who promise to free their countries from the existing order's constraints and rebuild stronger, more prosperous nations,\" arguing he was just one movement \"driven by resentment and regret over the liberal trajectory their societies have embarked on.\"Ischinger told CNBC that Europeans were \"totally on the sidelines\" on negotiations around Gaza and Ukraine.\"We have no role. Things have been decided by others,\" he said. \"When I look at the war in Ukraine, Europe has no place,\" he said, adding the U.S. and Russia were leading discussions.U.S. delegates have been helming peace talks with officials from Ukraine and Russia since late 2025, with European officials scrambling to maintain a say on how to end the four-year war between the two countries.\"Why the hell do we not have a place at the table? This is our continent. It's our future,\" Ischinger said on Friday. \"The answer, of course, is not that Donald Trump is making a mistake. The answer … is that we have failed to speak with one voice.\"Ischinger added that he rejected \"the blame game regarding the United States,\" but for areas where Europe \"clearly failed\" to adopt a strategic position. Delegates from all over the world are gathering for the Munich Security Conference on Friday. The event runs through Sunday. Ischinger told CNBC that the \"wrecking ball\" was \"being used by many\" in addition to Trump, including right-wing extremist parties across Europe and Russian President Vladimir Putin.But he called Trump \"the single most prominent example\" of someone who \"questions existing arrangements and tries to replace them.\" \"That is for countries like Germany, which have been so dependent on the existing international rules … a worrisome development,\" he added.Read moreCNBC reached out to both the White House and the Kremlin for responses to the MSC's commentary.Transatlantic trust had also been damaged by Trump's push for the U.S. to annex Greenland, Ischinger said. After weeks of rhetoric on bringing the Arctic island — a Danish territory — under Washington's control, Trump threatened to impose tariffs on European allies who stood in his way, before announcing a \"deal\" on Greenland had been reached. Since Trump's return to the White House, European leaders have been making commitments to drastically increase security spending. Last summer, European members of NATO agreed to raise defense spending to 5% of their individual national GDP — a move Trump had been pushing for for some time. The spending plans have bolstered European defense primes, some of which have seen their shares more than double in value, while order backlogs have hit record levels.Ischinger told CNBC Europe needed \"to create a more consolidated, a more competitive, a more unified defense industry.\"",

    "body": "watch nowLast spring, Chantel Williams' position in the federal government was in limbo. Williams, once a General Services Administration employee on its hiring and recruitment team, found herself in a state of confusion and anxiety. The agency she worked for was in a holding pattern as Elon Musk's so-called Department of Government Efficiency began its work to aggressively shrink the size and scope of government agencies at President Donald Trump's direction.The DOGE cuts, a pillar of Trump's second term, were swift and wide-reaching across the federal workforce. Some of the most affected agencies included the U.S. Agency for International Development, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the Department of Health and Human Services, and the Department of Education. \"As a federal employee, the oath is to the work and to the role, and not the administration,\" Williams said. \"It started off as feeling very startling that the transition wasn't occurring as seamlessly as it had in prior years, because I had been working at GSA through a transition before.\" Williams said she felt, for the first time, real turmoil about working for the federal government. \"It was hard to wake up every day wanting to continue to serve but feel as though your leadership may have a different priority or maybe an opposition of you continuing to move forward in that mission,\" said Williams.In the end, she opted to take deferred resignation, receiving pay to leave her government post. She joined thousands of others in what was the largest reduction of the federal workforce in history, according to the U.S. Office of Personnel Management. At the end of 2025, OPM reported that approximately 352,000 employees exited roles last year, with more than 123,000 taking the deferred resignation offer. In a release late last year, OPM said it was \"in line with President Trump's goal of a smaller, more efficient government.\"Caitlin Lewis, founder and director of Work for America, started her career in local government in New York City. Lewis launched the nonprofit in November of 2024 and has helped placed former federal workers in new roles around the country in the wake of federal workforce reductions over the last year.Megan Leigh Barnard | Work for AmericaAs mass layoffs and resignations hit federal workers like Williams, Caitlin Lewis stepped in to help.Her nonprofit, Work for America, launched in November 2024 to help local governments recruit talent to fill gaps in staffing. Through its Civic Match platform, it helps former federal workers find new roles at the state and local level. The Work for America team has grown from two people to 15 in the last year, and the vast majority have come from prior careers in state, local and federal government. Four employees came directly from federal government roles.\"We never imagined the volume of need that was going to occur,\" Lewis said. \"What is so unique about this job seeker population is how unexpected the layoffs were for so many of them. Government has long been a place of stability and meaning making, and so much of what we understand the government job to be was really upended in that moment.\"Lewis, the daughter of a forest firefighter and a youth prison counselor who grew up in California, said she became civically engaged at a young age. That engagement led her to local government in New York City in the Bill de Blasio administration, first in the mayor's office and then in housing and economic development. Work for America was informed by that experience. \"In a place like New York, it really showed me how when you have the right people in the right roles in government, that the public sector really can move mountains, and when you don't, the basics start to fall apart,\" she said. \"And unfortunately we've seen that occurring in communities across the country where there hasn't been the ability to get the right talent to lean into critical roles.\"Williams quickly landed a job at Work for America after taking deferred resignation. She is now a product and data manager with the nonprofit.In the last year, Work for America has placed nearly 200 job seekers, 150 of which are former federal workers, in roles across the country. More than 12,800 job seekers have signed up for Civic Match since Trump's election, representing more than 30 federal agencies. \"For many, it's been a year of chaos and confusion. But we saw for our customers — cities and state governments across the country — that there was a true opportunity to capture the incredible talent that was going to be exiting Washington,\" Lewis said.Nate Haight turned to Civic Match as sweeping cuts took place at USAID, where he spent a decade of his career. Haight started out as an intern, then became a contractor, and by last year had been working as an education advisor and contract and grants specialist in its Latin America and Caribbean Bureau. Last February, he was told his job was under review and would most likely be cut.\"I particularly loved my work in the education sector. It was really meaningful being able to go out and see the impact that the programs were having around the world,\" Haight said. \"I was invested in the work and I saw the difference that it was making.\"He opted to take the deferred resignation offer from the government and found a new role through Work for America's platform, knowing competition would be steep locally given how many other former federal workers were looking for jobs. Today, he's in Indiana with his wife and four children, working as a grants administrator for the city of Indianapolis and Marion County.\"I think the satisfaction and fulfillment that I've been able to find already working in local government, I just want to encourage others to give it a shot as well ... and to encourage everyone to keep their head up and know that all of the skills and experiences that they've gained, they're going to be able to make a tremendous impact wherever they end up landing,\" Haight said of his fellow former federal workers.In the months to come, Civic Match is rolling out new features including candidate match scores powered by artificial intelligence, improved location targeting for jobs, city-specific pages and more. Hope Rahill, a former political appointee in the Biden administration who left her role as the Trump administration moved in, is now director of people and culture at Work for America. Rahill said while the group has had success in placing candidates, many former workers are still looking for work and coming up on a year of \"unemployment or underemployment.\"\"There are still so many people looking for work,\" Rahill said.",

    "body": "watch nowPinterest shares cratered more than 20% on Friday, after the company cited tariff-related shocks in disappointing fourth-quarter earnings.The social media company's Q4 earnings came in below analysts' expectations, with revenue of $1.32 billion compared with LSEG consensus estimates of $1.33 billion. Net income for the quarter plunged 85% to $277 million from $1.85 billion the prior year.It also recorded  $541.5 million in adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization, or EBIDTA, below the $550 million that analysts were projecting.Pinterest expects first-quarter sales to be between $951 million and $971 million, which is also below analysts' forecasts of $980 million.CEO Bill Ready said the company \"absorbed an exogenous shock this year related to tariffs\" and was more exposed to reduced advertising spend from large retailers.Pinterest also announced plans in January to lay off less than 15% of its workforce and cut back on office space, in a bid to go all in on AI. It said it's \"reallocating resources\" to AI-focused teams and prioritizing \"AI-powered products and capabilities.\" Stock Chart IconStock chart iconPinterest one-day stock chart.What analysts are sayingIn a Friday note, Citi said it was downgrading shares of Pinterest from Buy to Neutral, \"given more limited visibility from larger UCAN & EU advertisers due in part to tariffs and challenges across specific verticals,\" such as home furnishing, the rebuilding of its go-to-market sales function as Pinterest broadens its advertiser base, and greater investments impacting margins. Pinterest's revenue performance is expected to continue to be \"pressured near-term by macro-related headwinds,\" such as tariffs and consumer spending, Goldman Sachs analysts said in a note on Friday.But they added: \"Despite these near-term headwinds, management remains optimistic around its long-term growth strategy centered around diversifying its advertiser base, automation, and performance-oriented objectives.The analysts noted that user growth remains particularly strong amongst Gen Z users. The company reported that its fourth-quarter global monthly active users jumped 12% year-over-year to 619 million, representing an all-time high. — CNBC's Jonathan Vanian contributed to this report ",

    "body": "A Waymo autonomous taxi outside the Google headquarters in Mountain View, California, US, on Tuesday, Feb. 3, 2026. David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesWaymo's cars are driven without humans. But when a departing passenger leaves a door open, the car won't move until a person closes it. For that task, Waymo is turning to gig workers from companies like DoorDash. The Alphabet-owned self-driving car company confirmed on Thursday that it's running a pilot in Atlanta to compensate delivery drivers for closing Waymo doors that are left ajar. DoorDash drivers are notified when a Waymo in the area has an open door so the vehicles can quickly get back on the road, the company said.That acknowledgement came after a Reddit post showed a DoorDash driver in Atlanta was offered $11.25 to close the door of a nearby Waymo.Waymo and DoorDash said in a joint statement to CNBC that they are always looking for new and flexible ways for DoorDash deliverers to earn money, adding that future Waymo vehicles will have automated door closures. Waymo didn't say when that capability will arrive. Waymo's reliance on people for simple tasks underscores how even the most advanced autonomous technologies still require costly human intervention for some basic operations. Valued at $126 billion in a recent financing round, Waymo is central to Alphabet's Other Bets, which are targeted at \"using technology to try to solve big problems that affect a wide variety of industries, including transportation and health technology,\" according to the company's financial filings. In Alphabet's annual filing last week, the company said the Other Bets segment recorded an operating loss last year of $7.5 billion, which included a $2.1 billion stock-based compensation charge at Waymo.In addition to DoorDash, Waymo is also paying users of Honk, an independent roadside assistance company, to close robotaxi doors. A recent Washington Post report said Honk users, who get paid to provide maintenance on Waymo vehicles, were offered up to $24 in Los Angeles for closing a door.On Thursday, Waymo began deploying its next-generation robotaxi as the company pushes to extend its lead in the U.S. Waymo currently offers its fully autonomous robotaxi service in six U.S. markets, with plans to expand to several more this year.WATCH: Waymo raises $16 billion at $126 billion valuation watch now",

    "body": "watch nowThe Trump administration on Thursday revoked a landmark scientific finding that serves as the legal foundation for federal regulations to limit greenhouse gas emissions, in a devastating blow to efforts to combat climate change. The Environmental Protection Agency's endangerment finding, established under President Barack Obama in 2009, classified carbon dioxide, methane and four other greenhouse gases as a threat to public health and welfare. It underpins Clean Air Act emissions standards and rules for cars and light trucks, power plants, and oil and gas industry facilities.\"This is about as big as it gets,\"  President Donald Trump said at the White House with EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin. \"Under the process just completed by the EPA, we are officially terminating the so-called endangerment finding.\" Zeldin said all greenhouse gas emissions standards on light, medium and heavy duty vehicles that followed the endangerment finding have been eliminated. \"No longer will automakers be pressured to shift their fleets towards electric vehicles,\" he said.The endangerment finding emerged from a Supreme Court decision in 2007 that greenhouse gases are air pollutants under the Clean Air Act and the EPA must determine whether they pose a threat to public health. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Administrator Lee Zeldin speaks accompanied by U.S. President Donald Trump, at the White House in Washington, D.C., U.S., February 12, 2026. Jonathan Ernst | ReutersZeldin's decision to revoke the finding is the most significant action taken yet in the Trump administration's campaign to dismantle U.S. regulations that address climate change. He described the repeal as the largest de-regulatory action in American history. Obama said in a social media post that the Trump administration's action makes the U.S. \"less safe, less healthy and less able to fight climate change — all so the fossil fuel industry can make even more money.\"The Sierra Club, the largest environmental group in the U.S., said Trump has formalized \"climate denialism as official government policy.\" It warned that eliminating greenhouse gas standards not only imperils the public, but will expose industries to a flood of litigation. The Supreme Court ruled in a unanimous decision in 2011 that companies cannot be sued under federal common law over greenhouse emissions because regulation of these emissions had been delegated to the EPA. Trump has sought to unleash fossil fuel production in the U.S. and kill Biden administration efforts to transition to renewable energy and electric vehicles. He withdrew the U.S. from the Paris Climate Agreement and has repealed key tax subsidies for solar, wind and EVs. ",

    "body": "Ring security cameras are displayed on a shelf at a Target store on June 01, 2023 in Novato, California. Justin Sullivan | Getty ImagesRing is terminating its partnership with police tech provider Flock Safety, the Amazon-owned company announced Thursday.The partnership between Flock and Ring came under scrutiny after the Amazon doorbell company ran an ad during the Super Bowl that touted a \"Search Party\" feature that uses artificial intelligence to help locate lost pets. When a user initiates the feature, it activates a network of participating Ring cameras, which scan footage for images resembling the missing dog. The Electronic Frontier Foundation called the feature a \"surveillance nightmare.\"  Flock, meanwhile, operates a network of automated license plate readers, and sells access to that software to customers that include law enforcement agencies. Ring's decision to cancel its partnership with Flock comes as tech companies face growing pressure to reexamine their work with federal agencies including Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Earlier this week, Salesforce employees pressed CEO Marc Benioff to cancel \"ICE opportunities,\" CNBC reported. More than 900 Google employees also asked their company to divest itself from ICE and U.S. Customs and Border Protection.Privacy and civil liberties advocates urged Ring to drop its partnership with Flock. A protest calling on the e-commerce company to cut its ties with Flock, ICE and CBP is scheduled for Friday, outside of Amazon's Seattle headquarters. \"Following a comprehensive review, we determined the planned Flock Safety integration would require significantly more time and resources than anticipated,\" Ring wrote in a blog post. \"As a result, we have made the joint decision to cancel the planned integration.\"watch nowFlock representatives didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.Amazon acquired Ring for $839 million in 2018. The home security company is primarily known for its connected doorbell devices, which can record footage and alert users to activity around their home or business via an app.Ring has long sparked controversy about privacy due to its partnerships with police. In recent years, the company had adopted a softer image, positioning its devices as a tool to capture porch pirates and family friendly hijinks. After founder Jamie Siminoff returned as CEO last year, the company has reembraced its original mission of fighting crime. The Amazon company announced its partnership with Flock last October, giving owners of its video doorbells the option to share footage with law enforcement agencies that use the startup's software to assist with their \"evidence collection and investigative work.\" Flock's systems have been adopted by thousands of communities and law enforcement agencies across the country, and both ICE and CBP have reportedly accessed Flock's data as part of President Donald Trump's immigration crackdown. Flock has denied that it shares data with ICE or any \"sub-agency\" of the Department of Homeland Security. Ring spokesperson Emma Daniels said in a statement that the Flock partnership was never active, and the companies never announced a date for it to go live. \"No videos were ever shared between these services,\" Daniels said. In response to the scrutiny of its Search Party tool, Daniels said Ring built the feature \"with strong privacy protections from the start.\" Ring users can decide on a case-by-case basis whether they want to share videos with a pet owner who initiates a Search Party, she said. The news was earlier reported by The Verge. ",

    "body": "watch nowRivian Automotive on Thursday beat Wall Street's fourth-quarter expectations and said it's targeting a significant increase in vehicle deliveries this year, but the automaker also cautioned that it will continue losing money as it launches its crucial R2 next-generation vehicle.Rivian's 2026 guidance includes increasing vehicle deliveries to between 62,000 and 67,000 units, which would be up by 47% to 59% compared with 2025. That increase is expected to be assisted by the launch of the R2 SUV during the second quarter.Rivian CEO RJ Scaringe told CNBC's Phil LeBeau on Thursday that the R2 is expected to be the \"majority of the volume\" of the business by the end of 2027, as it ramps up production at its sole factory in Normal, Illinois.The electric vehicle maker also said it expects adjusted pre-tax losses for 2026 of between $1.8 billion and $2.1 billion and capital expenditures between $1.95 billion and $2.05 billion. That compares with nearly $2.1 billion in adjusted pre-tax losses and $1.7 billion in capital expenditures last year.Scaringe described 2025 to investors Thursday as a \"foundational year\" for Rivian, while saying 2026 will mark \"an inflection point\" for the company.Shares of Rivian were up more than 20% during premarket trading Friday after closing at $14, down roughly 5%.watch nowHere's how the company performed in the fourth quarter compared with average estimates compiled by LSEG: Loss per share: 54 cents adjusted vs. a loss of 68 cents expectedRevenue: $1.29 billion vs. $1.26 billion expectedRivian's full-year 2025 revenue, including $1.7 billion during the fourth quarter, was up 8% compared with $4.97 billion in 2024.The company was able to achieve its first annual gross profit, which is closely watched by investors, of $144 million in 2025, including $120 million during the fourth quarter. That was driven by its software and services joint venture with Volkswagen offsetting $432 million in losses for its automotive business last year.This year's gross profit may not be as fruitful, with Rivian CFO Claire McDonough describing it as a \"transition year\" as it ramps up R2 production.Investors view gross profit as a key indicator of a business's profitability before operating expenses, interest and taxes.Rivian's net loss last year was $3.6 billion, an improvement from a loss of $4.75 billion in 2024. That includes an $804 million loss during the fourth quarter, accelerated by a decrease in earnings from the sale of regulatory credits, which was expected after changes by the Trump administration to federal fuel economy and emissions standards.Rivian ended the fourth quarter with $6.59 billion in total liquidity, including nearly $6.1 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments.It's needed capital for Rivian. This year is a crucial one for the automaker as it attempts to deliver on promises of technological advancements and improved profitability with the R2. The roughly $45,000 midsize vehicle, per Rivian, is expected to cut build material costs in half, reduce production complexity and significantly grow demand and sales.Rivian said the R2 is expected to initially be produced by one plant shift, followed by a second shift by the end of this year. The company said additional R2 details by model such as pricing, options and more will be available on March 12.Rivian has made important strides with its first-generation R1 pickup and SUV, but the market for such pricey EVs, which both start in the $70,000s, has slowed. It also continues to produce an all-electric delivery van, historically purchased by its largest shareholder, Amazon.",

The program lets users subscribe to different streaming services, like HBO Max and Paramount+, using a single login on the Roku platform. The company said it expects to roll out premium subscription bundles this year. For the current period, Roku said it expects to report $1.2 billion in revenue, which is higher than the $1.16 billion expected by analysts, according to StreetAccount. It also projected full-year revenue of $5.5 billion, surpassing analyst estimates of $5.34 billion, according to StreetAccount.Last May, Roku acquired Frndly, a live TV subscription streaming service, for $185 million. The company also recently launched an ad-free streaming service, called Howdy, that costs $2.99 a month. Wood told investors on the company's earnings call that Howdy has the potential to become a \"very large service\" over time. Roku also said it's on track to surpass 100 million streaming households this year.Analysts at Rosenblatt Securities on Friday upgraded Roku's stock to buy from neutral, citing the strong fourth-quarter results and several potential growth levers for the company in the near term.\"Big picture — Roku has built a formidable gatekeeper presence for U.S. streaming — half of all streaming in the U.S. on TVs goes through their devices,\" the analysts wrote.

    "body": "Jakub Porzycki | Nurphoto | Getty ImagesInstacart's stock surged over 7% after the company's robust results alleviated worries over mounting competitive pressures in the grocery delivery market.During an earnings call with analysts, CEO Chris Rogers, who took the helm last year, called the concerns \"overblown\" and said the company monitors threats \"extremely closely.\"\"There is definitely a market for us here and we feel good about our points of differentiation,\" he said. Instacart is facing an increasingly competitive market as retailers like Amazon and food platforms such as Uber Eats and Doordash aggressively scale in grocery delivery. At the same time, the company is investing in new technology and artificial intelligence tools to drive more customers and businesses to its platform. Wall Street analysts viewed Instacart's results as a wave of confidence for those worried about the company's moat. Analysts at Bernstein called the report a \"solid rebuttal\" to competitive pressures and AI threats.\"The clean beat-and-raise has been rare this internet earnings cycle and CART stands out from that perspective,\" wrote analysts at Barclays.

    "body": "Venezuela's interim President Delcy Rodríguez and U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright speak with the media after attending a meeting, marking the highest-level U.S. visit focused on energy policy to the OPEC nation in nearly three decades, as Washington conducts its first on-the-ground assessment of the oil industry it aims to help rebuild, in Caracas, Venezuela, Feb. 11, 2026.Leonardo Fernandez Viloria | ReutersVenezuela oil revenue will no longer be deposited in an account in Qatar, Energy Secretary Chris Wright told NBC News in an interview this week. \"An account was set up in Qatar, controlled by the U.S. government the whole time, to land that money in and then send the money from there down to Venezuela,\" Wright told NBC News on Thursday. \"Now we have an account at the U.S. Treasury. The money won't go to Qatar anymore,\" the energy secretary said.The Trump administration has taken control of Venezuela's oil sales after capturing former President Nicolás Maduro in a military raid last month. Wright met Venezuela's interim president, Delcy Rodríguez, in Venezuela this week, the highest-ranking U.S. official to visit the country in decades. Wright told NBC News that revenue from Venezuelan oil sales now tops $1 billion. The U.S. has short-term agreements to sell another $5 billion of the country's crude over the next few months, he said. The oil has gone to U.S. refineries and Europe so far, he said. The U.S. deposited the initial $500 million of oil sales in the Qatar account before transferring the funds back to Venezuela, Wright said. Democrats in Congress have questioned the transparency and legality of the arrangement. Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and Sen. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., introduced legislation Thursday that directs the Government Accountability Office to conduct an independent audit of the Qatar account.  watch nowWright said the U.S. deposited the initial sales in Qatar because the funds face the risk of Venezuela's creditors attempting to claim them. Caracas faces tens of billions of dollars in outstanding claims from defaulting on its sovereign debt and nationalizing the assets of oil companies like Exxon Mobil and ConocoPhillips. \"Since Venezuela has so many creditors and they owe a lot of money, we had some risk if we put it into a U.S. bank account set up quickly that creditors could freeze that money,\" Wright said. \"We want those creditors ultimately to get their money back, but that money urgently needs to get to Venezuela.\"The U.S. faces the added complication that it does not officially recognize the government led by Rodríguez. President Donald Trump recognized the 2015 opposition-led National Assembly during his first term in 2019. Secretary of State Marco Rubio told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on Jan. 28 that Washington must find a way to resolve the issue of government recognition for the funds to be deposited in the U.S.\"You have to recognize a government, but we don't recognize this government,\" Rubio said. \"We recognize the 2015 National Assembly, so we have to find some creative way legally to meet that standard.\"Venezuelan oil revenue deposited in the U.S. should in theory be under the control of the opposition National Assembly due to Trump's recognition, said Scott Anderson, an international law expert who previously served with the State Department and the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad under President Barack Obama.This raises the question of which government the U.S. will ultimately recognize and when. Wright told NBC that elections and a transition of power will likely happen in Venezuela during Trump's term. He said U.S. government oversight of Venezuela's domestic affairs would conclude at that point. \"It is a question of a process to get there,\" Wright said. \"Ultimately, what the long-term political leadership in Venezuela is going to be, it's going to be up to Venezuela.\"",

    "body": "DHL Autonomous Robot at work.Source: DHLWorkers at DHL Group used to walk close to a half marathon each day just to classify, pick and move items across massive warehouses.Now, their distance and efforts are greatly reduced by autonomous mobile robots that can unload containers for the package delivery and supply chain management company with a speed of up to 650 cases per hour.\"That is what we look forward to, and where we've been successful in deploying technology at scale over the last five years, going from when we started in 2020 with 240 projects, and now we're up to 10,000 projects,\" Tim Tetzlaff, DHL's global head of digital transformation, told CNBC. The company's autonomous innovations have accelerated processes at 95% of DHL's global warehouses. Item-picking robots in one warehouse have increased units picked per hour by 30%, while autonomous forklifts at that same warehouse have contributed a 20% increase in efficiency, the company said.Tetzlaff said automation is important for the company because it's such a labor-intensive business.\"We still have the ambition to grow our business even further, but if you look at where these distribution centers should be located … it's typically very tough to find additional labor or even additional spaces just to build these warehouses there,\" he said. DHL is one of multiple fulfillment companies moving toward automation and leveraging artificial intelligence as the industry works toward greater efficiency. On an earnings call with analysts in late January, United Parcel Service CEO Carol Tomé said the company deployed automation in 57 buildings in the fourth quarter, bringing its total to 127 automated buildings, with plans for 24 more in 2026.\"This year, we plan to further automate our network and as a result, we expect to increase the percentage of U.S. volume we process through automated facilities to 68% by the end of the year, up from 66.5% at the end of 2025,\" she said.Similarly, FedEx has said it sees automation as an opportunity to enhance its workers' jobs, installing robotic arms to help process small packages at its Memphis hub and working with AI company Dexterity to leverage robots for loading boxes into containers. Its \"Network 2.0\" initiative is working to increase the efficiency of its package processes.The company recently announced a partnership with Berkshire Grey to launch a fully autonomous robot to unload containers and optimize operations.It estimates that the global warehouse automation market is expected to exceed $51 billion by 2030.\"We now have about 24% of our eligible average daily volume flowing through 355 Network 2.0-optimized facilities,\" CEO Raj Subramaniam said on a call with analysts in December.A human fleetA worker unloads packages from a FedEx truck in San Francisco, California, US, on Wednesday, Dec. 17, 2025. David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesWith the rise of automation, companies are weighing the balance between their human workers and their technological innovations.UPS has announced layoffs north of 75,000 over the past year as the company focuses on efficiency and cuts down its partnership with Amazon amid a multiyear turnaround plan.The company also said it closed 93 buildings in 2025 and plans to shutter at least 24 buildings in the first half of 2026.\"What's happening is you're seeing a cascading effect of sites being closed that are legacy conventional facilities, a lot of labor required to run those facilities, to a much more nimble, quicker, automated, consolidated facility,\" Executive Vice President Nando Cesarone said on the January call.In a statement to CNBC, a UPS spokesperson said the company is focused on making jobs easier for its employees and that the AI and robotics take on repetitive tasks that \"make us more efficient in other functions.\"FedEx did not respond to requests for comment on how the company is balancing its workforce and technology. Subramaniam said on the most recent earnings call that the Network 2.0 initiative has resulted in \"structural cost reductions\" but the company has not publicly disclosed job cut amounts.Teamsters, the union representing workers from many of the major packaging companies, said it will remain focused on ensuring its team members have a voice at the table when it comes to technology.\"We never want to get in the way of technology and its development, but all of that, it must support workers, and it cannot work against them ever,\" spokesperson Lena Melentijevic told CNBC. \"It's the workers who are the backbone of each one of these companies and who are essential to their success, and we are here to advocate for them and hold companies accountable.\"DHL's Tetzlaff said the company wants its automation to complement human labor instead of replacing it altogether. Regardless of how much DHL's technology improves, Tetzlaff said the dexterous tasks of packaging and shipping remain in the hands of the employees.\"In the time where we deployed 8,000 collaborative robotics into our operation worldwide, we still hired 40,000 people,\" he said. The biggest area where DHL has deployed its robotics is in item picking, with more than 2,500 robots using trained arms to select items for packages. This past holiday season, to keep up with the Black Friday and Christmas demand, the company added 30% capacity to its robotic fleet.\"There's an advantage for us as a company, having a great human fleet of workers that is motivated and likes the job, but complementing this with a robotic fleet that we can scale up and down and have that flexible stability to deal with change, the peaks throughout the year, be it bigger changes like Covid, be it [customer] profile changes and so on,\" he said.The path forward for investmentDHL Autonomous Forklift at work.Source: DHLStill, it's unlikely there will be a near future in which warehouses are full of humanoid robots, according to supply chain expert and Accenture logistics and fulfillment lead Benjamin Reich.Humanoid robots have been gaining intense popularity as tech companies innovate human-like machines, with Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang saying he believes the innovation is fast moving. At the January CES trade show, Google announced a partnership with Boston Dynamics, the same company working with DHL, to augment the tech company's new robot named Atlas.But Reich said among his clients, he's seeing that \"humans are still in the lead.\"\"We are also not seeing a replacement of jobs, but a shifting that you're more looking for skill sets on the market to serve the gap between degree of automation, operational tasks as well as organizational,\" Reich told CNBC. The automation is angled toward specific jobs, he added, with robots taking over repetitive tasks and companies instead \"redirecting\" their hiring toward technical roles instead of eliminating job growth altogether.Reich said the industry is seeing rising investments into automation, with the biggest gains coming not from replacing people, but through increasing the efficiency of the supply chain and warehouse execution processes.There are also factors in the broader industry that are impacting the workforce, according to Ronny Horvath, the transportation and logistics lead at Accenture. There's a shortage of skilled workers who have both the manual skills and the organizational skills needed for the sector, and there's also competition among companies for warehouse personnel based on pay, benefits, lifestyle and more.\"So automation can also help, not replacing but augmenting that gap, that void, that has been left by just not getting the workers that you have today,\" Horvath said. \"And we see a lot of clients, they have an automation or robotic strategy … but they still have the plans to hire human workers as well.\"Horvath added that the industry is reaping the rewards of its new technology. He's seen companies able to adjust to deliver on high demand, increase efficiency and work toward more automated processes to keep up with warehousing. According to an Accenture study from March, 51% of factories globally expect to have fully automated warehouses by 2040, and 70% of transportation logistics executives treat autonomous supply chains as a top investment priority.\"There's almost no autonomous structure existing at the moment,\" Horvath said. \"So most or some of these clients are starting from scratch, and this will take time until these investments are done and until they also reap the benefits out of it for all those areas.\"",

    "body": "watch nowTop Goldman Sachs lawyer Kathryn Ruemmler said Thursday night that she will leave the investment bank at the end of June, a decision that came after a flurry of news articles highlighting documents detailing the former White House counsel's often chummy email conversations with the notorious sex predator Jeffrey Epstein.Goldman, for months, has defended Ruemmler after Congress and then the Department of Justice released emails between her and Epstein, as well as other documents related to investigations of him. Ruemmler, who has been a key advisor to Goldman CEO David Solomon since joining the bank in 2020, told the Financial Times on Thursday, \"I made the determination that the media attention on me, relating to my prior work as a defence attorney, was becoming a distraction.\"The FT first reported the 54-year-old's decision to leave Goldman, where she has been general counsel and chief legal officer, at the beginning of the summer.Solomon, in an interview on Friday with CNBC's \"Squawk Box,\" called Ruemmler \"a tremendous human being.\"\"She called me yesterday afternoon and told me that ... the press coverage of the work that she had done previously and of this whole situation had just gotten to a level of noise and distraction that she thought was distracting the firm,\" Solomon said. \"It was putting her in a position where it was hard for her to execute on her job and her responsibilities, and she just thought it was time to step away.\"Ruemmler, in a statement Thursday night to CNBC, said, \"Since I joined Goldman Sachs six years ago, it has been my privilege to help oversee the firm's legal, reputational, and regulatory matters; to enhance our strong risk management processes; and to ensure that we live by our core value of integrity in everything we do.\"\"My responsibility is to put Goldman Sachs' interests first,\" Ruemmler said.\"Earlier today, I regretfully informed David Solomon of my intention to step down as Chief Legal Officer and General Counsel of Goldman Sachs as of June 30, 2026.\"Solomon, in a statement Thusday, said, \"Throughout her tenure, Kathy has been an extraordinary general counsel, and we are grateful for her contributions and sound advice on a wide range of consequential legal matters for the firm.\"\"As one of the most  accomplished professionals in her field, Kathy has also been a mentor and friend to many of our people, and she will be missed. I accepted her resignation, and I respect her decision,\" Solomon said.Her announcement that she will leave Goldman comes nearly a week after The Wall Street Journal reported that Ruemmler was one of three people whom Epstein called on July 6, 2019, after being arrested by federal authorities on child sex trafficking charges at an airport in New Jersey. The Journal's report cites a handwritten set of notes by law enforcement about comments Epstein made inside an FBI vehicle after his arrest.Those notes are among documents released in late January by the Department of Justice, CNBC has confirmed.Other news articles detailed emails and documents showing how Epstein had made gifts to Ruemmler that included a Hermes bag, and other luxury items, such as a Fendi purse, spa visits, Bergdorf Goodman gift cards and flowers. On one occasion, she effusively thanked him, calling him \"Uncle Jeffrey,\" one email showed.Ruemmler was a white-collar criminal defense lawyer at the firm Latham & Watkins during the years she was speaking with Epstein, whom she met in 2014.An Aug. 14, 2014, email contained in the DOJ's Epstein files shows how he asked her to represent his client, Bank Edmond de Rothschild.\"They have a justice department problem ... like every other swiss bank,\" Epstein wrote her.Ruemmler took the bank as a client for Latham.Ruemmler has said that she never represented Epstein, who killed himself in a New York federal jail weeks after his 2019 arrest.Read more CNBC politics coverageEpstein files: DOJ says it logs Congress members' searches to 'protect' victim informationEpstein files: AG Pam Bondi seemed to have Rep. Jayapal's DOJ database search history at hearingJudge blocks Pete Hegseth's censure of Sen. Mark Kelly over troops video, for nowWatch Pam Bondi hearing: AG touts record Dow as Democrats grill her over Trump, EpsteinRuemmler's spokeswoman, Jennifer Connelly, told the Journal for its story last Friday, \"These documents are consistent with what Ms. Ruemmler has repeatedly said: She knew Epstein when she was a criminal defense attorney and shared a client with him.\"\"She was friendly with him in that context. She had no knowledge of any ongoing criminal conduct on his part,\" Connelly said.Ruemmler previously served as White House counsel under former President Barack Obama.She is the latest person to lose a high-profile position because of her prior association with Epstein.On Sunday, Morgan Sweeney resigned as chief of staff to British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, saying he took responsibility for advising Starmer to appoint Peter Mandelson as the United Kingdom's ambassador to the United States. Starmer fired Mandelson from that post in September over disclosures about his connection to Epstein.Last week, Brad Karp, chairman of the major corporate law firm Paul Weiss, resigned from that post after fallout over emails between him and Epstein. Karp is staying at the firm.In response to the Epstein emails, a Paul Weiss spokesman previously said, \"Mr. Karp never witnessed or participated in any misconduct. Mr. Karp attended two group dinners in New York City and had a small number of social interactions by email, all of which he regrets.\"Karp said he was leaving the chairman's post because of the distraction of the news stories.In November, after a congressional committee released emails between Ruemmler and Epstein, Goldman Sachs spokesman Tony Fratto told CNBC, \"These emails were private correspondence well before Kathy Ruemmler joined Goldman Sachs.\"\"Kathy is an exceptional general counsel and we benefit from her judgment every day,\" Fratto said at the time.Ruemmler has previously told the Journal that she regrets ever knowing Epstein.Among the new tranche of emails that the DOJ released in late January is one that Ruemmler sent Epstein in March 2019, four months before his arrest.In that email, she offered advice on how to respond to criticism that he had previously received special treatment and a light punishment in 2008 because of his wealth and political connections when he avoided federal prosecution in exchange for pleading guilty in Florida state court to a charge of soliciting prostitution from an underage girl. At the time Epstein sought Ruemmler's advice, he had been the subject of a series of articles in the Miami Herald that were critical of the decision by federal prosecutors not to file charges against him in 2008. Epstein ended up serving just 13 months in state prison in Florida, but was allowed out to go to his office during the day for much of that time.The subject line of the email thread, \"From wapo,\" suggests that Epstein was reaching out to Ruemmler because of an inquiry by The Washington Post about him.Ruemmler wrote in the email: \"Something like: … 'The criticism is wrong and reflects a fundamental [misunderstanding] of both the facts underlying Mr. Epstein's case and how it was [prosecuted] by both local and federal authorities.\"\"Far from [receiving] a sweetheart deal, Mr. Epstein was subjected to a lengthy, aggressive, [and] highly unusual federal investigation for what were, in essence, local [offenses] of sexual solicitation,\" Ruemmler wrote. \"He accepted responsibility, served [time and] prison, and paid significant monetary settlements to the victims [involved].\"Ruemmler, in a bracketed section, also suggested saying something like, \"But for his wealth, it is hard to imagine that Mr. Epstein … would have received the aggressive treatment that he did from [federal] prosecutors, and he certainly would never have been subjected to the [salacious] and malicious treatment by the media that he continues to receive more than 10 years after the case was resolved.\"",

    "body": "<div><div><p>Companies like Starbucks, Paramount and Microsoft are among the latest to issue new return-to-office requirements, but mass RTO has been a years-long push across Corporate America. Getting workers back in hasn't been so easy.</p><p>People are spending <a href=\"https://wfhresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/WFHResearch_updates_October2025.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">about 25%</a> of their days working from home, and that share hasn't budged since spring 2023, says Nick Bloom, a Stanford professor and leading researcher on remote work trends, and based on a recurring survey of 10,000 Americans from his team at WFH Research.</p><p>Work-from-home rates have persisted, Bloom tells CNBC Make It, even as the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/05/official-jobs-numbers-show-its-a-bad-time-to-be-looking-for-workunless-youre-in-this-field.html\">labor market sours</a>, people <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/18/job-hugging-job-hopping.html\">cling to their jobs</a> and leverage swings back in the direction of CEOs making RTO calls.</p><p>What gives?</p></div><h2><a></a>Passive resistance</h2><div><p>Bloom points to a few factors. First is a \"growing compliance gap.\"</p><p>\"Firms are announcing RTOs,\" he says. \"It just does not look like employees are following through on the ground.\"</p><p>He thinks of it as passive resistance: CEOs make a big announcement, but the middle managers tasked with enforcing the rule don't want to follow it themselves, much less make direct reports do so.</p><p>Managers are typically assessed on the performance of their team, and if they're performing well enough, they're unlikely to see the benefit of an increased attendance rule, Bloom says. Senior leaders may overlook any rule-bending too.</p><p>Many businesses are also <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/15/laid-off-managers-are-fighting-for-shrinking-pool-of-jobs.html\">shrinking their layers of middle management</a>. This can lead to burnout among the bosses who remain, which in turn can result in less enforcement of these RTO mandates.</p></div><h2><a></a>Back in the office, but on workers' terms</h2><div><p>Then, there's the issue of tracking whether people are in for the actual number of days required by company policy.</p><p>Take a company that has a four-day office policy, but most people only go in for three. It can be hard to track exactly why someone didn't meet the attendance requirement for a given week. They could be out taking client meetings, at a conference, at an appointment, taking a sick day or just on vacation, Bloom says.</p><p>One Fortune 100 company Bloom spoke with has a three-day attendance policy, but over an eight-week rolling average, they only flag if someone is in fewer than one-and-a-half days per week. The company's HR chief chalked up the missing in-office time to people being out on<strong> </strong>business travel, Bloom says.</p><p>Other workers are showing up for the required number of days, but experimenting with how long they actually have to be there. Some 43% of hybrid workers partake in <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2023/10/05/as-return-to-office-mandates-pick-up-employees-find-coffee-badging-workaround.html\">coffee badging</a>, or going to the office for a few hours just to show their faces, and 12% want to give it a try, according to <a href=\"https://owllabs.com/state-of-hybrid-work/2025\" target=\"_blank\">Owl Labs' recent survey</a> of 2,000 full-time workers. Among those who've been caught, more than half say their employer didn't mind the practice.</p><p>Coffee badging is down from 2023 levels, but consistent with last year.</p><p>The majority of hybrid workers go into the office three to four days a week, which is up from last year, says Frank Weishaupt, CEO of Owl Labs. At the same time, they're finding ways to maintain flexibility by<strong> </strong>coffee badging, scheduling personal appointments during the day, or trying what he calls \"micro-shifting\" —working in short, non-linear blocks not bound by a 9-to-5 and instead based on personal energy, responsibilities or productivity patterns.</p><p>As far as flexibility goes, \"they're finding it wherever they can,\" Weishaupt says.</p></div><h2><a></a>Quitting RTO companies for more flexibility</h2><div><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/01/23/heres-how-workers-feel-about-return-to-office-mandates.html\">Workers quit</a> when they don't get the flexibility they want, or see it being clawed back by their employers, experts say. That could be by design.</p><p>\"RTO is being used as a bit of a cheap way to reduce headcount\" by avoiding layoffs and paying out severance, Bloom says. Quitters could be scooped up by younger, smaller firms that offer flexibility as a perk when they can't compete with big-company salaries. That could be another reason why work-from-home rates have, on the whole, remained the same.</p><p>The problem with using RTO to shrink headcount is \"you don't get to choose who leaves,\" Bloom says.</p><p>Previous <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id%3D5031481&sa=D&source=docs&ust=1738276665510716&usg=AOvVaw3ivjgB12fXEltD0Xk8rANF\" target=\"_blank\">research from the University of Pittsburgh</a> found that women, senior and skilled employees were most likely to leave companies that <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/02/whats-in-store-for-remote-work-and-rto-in-2025.html\">enacted new RTO policies</a>.</p><p>Businesses say offering remote and hybrid work improves their ability to hire, especially for hard-to-fill roles or in so-called \"talent deserts\" in certain areas of the country, says ZipRecruiter economist Nicole Bachaud.</p><p>Around 20% of employers say they're looking to hire fully remote workers this year, and a similar share are on the hunt to hire candidates in a hybrid role, according to ZipRecruiter data.</p><p>\"There is still demand for these types of roles within companies,\" Bachaud says, \"but a smaller share than we've seen in the past, for sure.\"</p><p><em><strong>Want to be your own boss?</strong> Sign up for CNBC's new online course, </em><a href=\"https://smarter.cnbcmakeit.com/p/how-to-start-a-business-for-first-time-founders?utm_source=cnbc&utm_medium=makeitarticle&utm_campaign=bottom\" target=\"_blank\"><em>How To Start A Business: For First-Time Founders</em></a><em>.

The report said that the SEC is responding to a whistleblower complained filed this year along with multiple short-seller reports, and added that neither the company nor its officials have been accused of wrongdoing.</p><p>An AppLovin spokesperson said the company doesn't typically comment on the \"existence or non-existence\" of regulatory matters.</p><p>\"That said, as a global public company, we regularly engage with regulators and if we get inquiries we address them in the ordinary course,\" the spokesperson said in a statement. \"Material developments, if any, would be disclosed through the appropriate public channels.\"</p><p>The stock dropped 14% in regular trading after the report, which landed shortly before market close. It fell another 5% in extended trading. </p><p>AppLovin's stock has been on a tear, jumping about 80% this year after soaring more than 700% in 2024. The surge has been driven by the company's artificial intelligence technology that's allowed it to provide better ad targeting capabilities to brands.</p><p>Last month, AppLovin was <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/05/applovin-robinhood-sp-500.html\">added</a> to the S&P 500, replacing MarketAxess Holdings, at the same time that <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/HOOD/\">Robinhood</a><span><span></span></span></span> joined the index in place of Caesars Entertainment.</p><p>AppLovin made the move into the benchmark despite a short-seller's effort to keep it out.</p><p>In March, Fuzzy Panda Research <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/07/applovin-short-seller-urges-sp-500-committee-to-exclude-stock.html\">advised the committee</a> for the large-cap U.S. index to keep AppLovin from becoming a constituent. AppLovin shares dropped 15% in December, when the committee picked Workday to join the S&P 500.</p><p>Three notable short-seller firms, including Fuzzy Panda, have slammed AppLovin of late.

But, the winter slate is poised to deliver a consistent spark of ticket sales, pushing the 2025 domestical haul above $9 billion and toward a post-pandemic high, according to the latest estimates.</p><p>\"The box office year-to-date domestically is running about 4% ahead of last year and, if we can expand on that lead, we could be looking at the biggest post-pandemic year for movies,\" said Paul Dergarabedian, head of marketplace trends at Comscore.</p><p>Heading into the fourth quarter, the domestic box office has tallied $6.5 billion in ticket sales this year, up from $6.3 billion a year prior, according to data from Comscore. The full-year record the box office is looking to surpass is $9.05 billion, which was tallied in 2023.</p><p>Analysts at Macquarie foresee <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/DIS/\">Disney's</a><span><span></span></span></span> \"Tron: Ares\" as the first domino to fall, creating momentum throughout the rest of the year.

    "body": "<div><p>Peter Lynch, Fidelity Funds Advisory Board Member.</p><p>CNBC</p></div><div><p>Legendary investor <a href=\"https://link.cnbc.com/public/31279740\" target=\"_blank\">Peter Lynch</a> built a reputation for routinely beating the market while overseeing Fidelity Magellan Fund in the 1980s. Decades later, he has some advice for the next generation of investors.</p><p>The artificial intelligence boom has dominated the market for the past three years, but Lynch, who averaged a 29.2% annual return in his 13 years at the helm of Magellan until 1990, has been happy to watch from the sidelines.</p><p>\"I have zero AI stocks,\" Lynch said on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIlurDigZcY\" target=\"_blank\">\"The Compound and Friends\"</a> podcast with investor <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/josh-brown/\">Josh Brown</a> . \"I literally couldn't pronounce <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/NVDA/\">Nvidia</a><span><span></span></span></span> until about eight months ago.\"</p><p>Lynch, who famously claimed that at one time <a href=\"https://thelynchfoundation.com/peterlynch\" target=\"_blank\">1 out of every 100 Americans had a stake in Fidelity Magellan</a>, on the podcast addressed his career, the lessons he's learned along the way and, yes, today's craze for everything tied to artificial intelligence. Here are five of the biggest takeaways:</p><h3>Sitting out AI</h3><p>Megacap tech stocks have skyrocketed since the introduction of <a href=\"https://chatgpt.com/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=paidsearch_brand&utm_campaign=GOOG_C_SEM_GBR_Core_CHT_BAU_ACQ_PER_MIX_ALL_NAMER_US_EN_091724&utm_term=chatgpt&utm_content=169187630042&utm_ad=713941893301&utm_match=e&gad_source=1&gad_campaignid=21714513245&gbraid=0AAAAA-IW-UXxJOvlrH5weOlPYvA7ekZM_&gclid=Cj0KCQjw0Y3HBhCxARIsAN7931WRYGacXttcAl74xMh8Xp6yvqGLD8SrPQ-cS5NQr_94Kj_6TscBZwwaAgZnEALw_wcB\" target=\"_blank\">ChatGPT</a> in late 2022, leading many on Wall Street to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/06/another-mark-moving-ai-chip-deal-reason-to-buy-or-is-this-just-more-money-going-in-a-circle.html\">question</a> if the AI trade is reminiscent of the dot-com bubble in the late 1990s. Asked if  investors have chased the AI trade too far, Lynch said he had \"no idea.\"</p><p>Lynch said he doesn't understand technology enough to have an informed opinion on the market's optimism toward AI.</p><p>\"I'm the lowest tech guy ever,\" he said. \"I can't do anything with computers. I just have yellow pads.\"</p><p>Lynch declined to discuss his current portfolio or the stocks he likes at the moment, citing rules from Fidelity.</p><h3>Why you don't 'play the market'</h3><p>Lynch has long advocated that investors have a deep understanding of the companies they invest in. It's a core tenet of his book \"<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/One-Up-Wall-Street-Already/dp/0743200403\" target=\"_blank\">One Up on Wall Street</a>.\"</p><p>\"I have this expression: 'Know what you own,''' Lynch said. \"If you don't understand what you own, you're toast.\"</p><p>Lynch said people will spend hours researching flights to ensure they get the best price. But when it comes to investing, he said \"they'll put $10,000 in some crazy stock they heard on the bus.\"</p><p>He described the phrase \"play the market\" as \"awful\" and \"dangerous.\" Instead, Lynch said people should buy good companies and have an awareness of what they do.</p><p>Lynch said that the average variation in a typical New York Stock Exchange security in any given year is 100%, so investors need to know what to do when big moves happen.</p><h3>Entering after the first inning</h3><p>While the conventional wisdom is to buy stocks before they take off, Lynch cautioned against scorning all investment ideas just because a security has already rallied.</p><p>\"Sometimes, you don't have to be in the first inning,\" Lynch said.</p><p>As an example, Lynch pointed to <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/MCD/\">McDonald's</a><span><span></span></span></span>, which he was told long ago had already seen rapid domestic growth. The hamburger chain went on to see strong growth when it expanded internationally.</p><p>\"People said 'McDonald's is done,'\" Lynch said. \"They just simply didn't think it through.\"</p><h3>Investment advantages today</h3><p>Today's investors have \"cushions\" that didn't exist before the <a href=\"https://www.federalreservehistory.org/essays/great-depression\" target=\"_blank\">Great Depression</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.loc.gov/classroom-materials/united-states-history-primary-source-timeline/great-depression-and-world-war-ii-1929-1945/franklin-delano-roosevelt-and-the-new-deal/\" target=\"_blank\">New Deal</a>, according to Lynch.</p><p>Lynch named unemployment insurance, Social Security benefits and the creation of the Securities and Exchange Commission helping everyday people over time. He also highlighted the active role of the Federal Reserve in recent decades. </p><p>Investors today benefit from \"so many things that are better,\" Lynch said, noting more market and economic \"buffers\" than existed in the past.</p><p>Lynch said investors have frequently braced for an economic collapse on the order of the 1930s. But none of the market tests since then, even the <a href=\"https://www.newyorkfed.org/research/global_economy/policyresponses.html\" target=\"_blank\">Global Financial Crisis</a> in 2008-2009, have had the same downward intensity.</p><p>\"We had many opportunities to have a 'big one,'\" Lynch said. \"We've had some probably bad presidents, some bad congresses, we've had bad economists, and we've made it through.\"</p><h3>Future of work</h3><p>Lynch reassured workers who wonder if they will lose their jobs to AI.</p><p>In the early 1980s,about <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell_System#:~:text=The%20Bell%20System%20was%20a,employed%20over%20one%20million%20people.\" target=\"_blank\">one million people</a> worked for <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/T/\">AT&T</a><span><span></span></span></span> alone at a time when the entire labor force <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/269959/employment-in-the-united-states/\" target=\"_blank\">stood at about 100 million</a>. Even as the telecom sector has grown, Lynch said the leading companies today employ about 400,000 workers. </p><p>Today, the U.S. workforce itself has swelled <a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.htm\" target=\"_blank\">past 160 million jobs</a>. Americans can probably count on expansion in some sectors to help offset elimination tied to technological advances or automation in others.</p><p>Lynch's comments come as executives at companies ranging from <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/WMT/\">Walmart</a><span><span></span></span></span> to <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/CSA-FF/\">Accenture</a><span><span></span></span></span> have warned that artificial intelligence will <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/29/walmart-ceo-ai-is-literally-going-to-change-every-job.html\">drastically</a> <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/26/accenture-plans-on-exiting-staff-who-cant-be-reskilled-on-ai.html\">reshape</a> their workforces.</p><p>\"It's a great country.

He showed how third-party applications could plug in with OpenAI's Apps SDK, or software development framework.</p><p>\"When someone's using ChatGPT, you'll be able to find an app by asking for it by name,\" Altman said. \"For example, you could sketch out a product flow for ChatGPT and then say, Figma, turn this sketch into a workable diagram. The Figma app will take over respond and complete the action.\"</p><p>In addition to asking for Figma's help by name in ChatGPT, the assistant can also suggest Figma when it's relevant, Figma product manager Luke Zhang said in a <a href=\"https://www.figma.com/blog/turn-your-chatgpt-brainstorms-into-figjam-diagrams/\" target=\"_blank\">blog post</a>.</p><p>The rally for Figma, at its high point, was the steepest since the day of the company's <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/31/figma-fig-starts-trading-on-nyse-after-ipo.html\">public market debut</a> on the New York Stock Exchange in July.</p><p>Figma has been ramping up <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/03/figma-ceo-dylan-fields-path-from-college-dropout-to-billionaire.html\">its own tools</a> for working on app and website designs using generative AI models <a href=\"https://www.figma.com/blog/turn-your-chatgpt-brainstorms-into-figjam-diagrams/\" target=\"_blank\">from OpenAI</a> and other providers.</p><p>Subscribers to products that connect to the Apps SDK will be able to log in without leaving their ChatGPT conversations, Altman said. He said people working on products in Figma can also launch the FigJam tool to keep working on development ideas. Apps SDK is based on the Model Context Protocol, an open standard that OpenAI rival Anthropic <a href=\"https://www.anthropic.com/news/model-context-protocol\" target=\"_blank\">introduced</a> last year.</p><p>Software developers will be able to submit apps for review later in 2025, Altman said.</p><p>Over time, OpenAI will offer many ways to generate revenue through third-party integrations, Altman said. Last week, OpenAI <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/29/chatgpt-instant-checkout-etsy-shopify.html\">announced a feature</a> allowing people to buy products listed on <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/ETSY/\">Etsy</a><span><span></span></span></span> through ChatGPT.</p><p><strong>WATCH:</strong> <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/video/2025/09/03/figma-shares-slide-on-revenue-growth-rate-outlook.html\">Figma shares slide on revenue growth rate outlook</a></p></div><div><p><img src=\"https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/108194303-1756996150457-1756931712-41480955633-hd.jpg?v=1756996178&w=750&h=422&vtcrop=y\" alt=\"Figma shares slide on revenue growth rate outlook\" /><span></span><span><div><p><span>watch now</span><span></span></p></div></span></p></div></div>",

If anything, now is so much more potentially explosive than 1999.\"</p><p>The founder and chief investment officer of Tudor Investment said today's market is reminiscent of the setup leading up to the burst of the dot-com bubble in late 1999, with dramatic rallies in technology shares and heightened speculative behavior. Jones said the circular deals or vendor financing happening in the artificial intelligence space today also made him \"nervous.\"</p><p>The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite has bounced 55% from its April bottom to consecutive record highs.

The Federal Reserve had just begun a new easing cycle, whereas rate hikes were on the way before the market top in 2000. The U.S. is now running a 6% budget deficit, while in 1999, there was a budget surplus of $99,000, Jones said.</p><p>\"That fiscal monetary combination is a brew that we haven't seen since, I guess, the postwar period, early '50s,\" he said.</p><p>The longtime investor highlighted the tension at the heart of every late-stage bull market — the eagerness to capture outsized gains and the inevitability of a painful correction.</p><p>\"You have to get on and off the train pretty quick. If you just think about bull markets, the greatest price appreciations always [occurs] the 12 months preceding the top,\" Jones said. \"It kind of doubles whatever the annual averages, and before then, if you don't play it, you're missing out on the juice; if you do play it, you have to have really happy feet, because there will be a really, really bad end to it.\"</p><p>To be sure, Jones isn't predicting an immediate downturn. He believes the bull market still has room to run before it reaches its final phase.</p><p>\"It will take a speculative frenzy for us to elevate those prices. It will take more retail buying. It'll take more recruitment from a variety of others from long short hedge funds, from real money, etc.,\" he said.</p><p>He said he would own a combination of gold, cryptocurrencies and Nasdaq tech stocks between now and the end of the year to take advantage of the rally fueled by the fear of missing out.</p><p>Jones shot to fame after he predicted and profited from the 1987 stock market crash. He is also the co-founder of nonprofit Just Capital, which ranks public U.S. companies based on social and environmental metrics.</p><p><em>Correction: The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite has bounced 55% from its April bottom to consecutive record highs. A previous version misstated the percentage.</em></p></div></div>",

    "body": "<div><div><p>Alistair Berg | Digitalvision | Getty Images</p></div><div><p>Online holiday spending in the U.S. is expected to jump 5.3% year over year to $253.4 billion as consumers seek discounts and even enlist the help of artificial intelligence-powered chatbots, according to an Adobe Analytics report released Monday.</p><p>Yet that growth would still be slower than the year-ago holiday season, when online sales rose 8.7% from Nov. 1 to Dec. 31, the company said. Adobe's data tracks more than 1 trillion visits to U.S. retail websites, 100 million unique items and 18 different product categories.</p><p>That growth is also below the 10-year average of roughly 13% annually. That mark was partially skewed by the 32% year-over-year growth in 2020 when consumers leaned on retailers' online options during the Covid pandemic.</p></div><div><p>Customers' desire to celebrate the season with decor and gifts — and to take advantage of lower prices during a promotional time — will prop up spending even at an uncertain time for the U.S. economy, said Vivek Pandya, Adobe's director of digital insights.</p><p>\"The holiday season is one of the areas where they do feel much more of an onus and a drive to get the goods they need,\" he said. \"We're seeing them willing to spend and capitalize on these sales moments.\"</p><p>Plus, he said consumers have embraced the habit of stockpiling goods if they feel prices may be volatile, which could help to stabilize spending.</p><p>He said while holiday spending is expected to slow from last year, \"given everything that the consumer is dealing with, it's still pronounced growth.\"</p><p>Higher online spending may not necessarily translate to a boost in overall holiday sales. Adobe's data tracks only e-commerce, and the company estimates about 1 in 4 dollars of holiday sales will be spent online, Pandya said.</p><p>Retail sales in the U.S. have chugged along this year, but concerns about <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/11/consumer-prices-rose-at-annual-rate-of-2point9percent-in-august-as-weekly-jobless-claims-jump.html\">higher prices from tariffs</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/30/consumer-confidence-is-lower-than-expected-as-wall-street-braces-for-shutdown-data-blackout.html\">dipping consumer confidence</a> have complicated the outlook for the critical shopping season. Some holiday forecasts, which capture both in-store and online spending, have predicted more modest growth than in recent years or even a decline.</p><p>Holiday spending across stores and online is expected to grow 4% year over year – a decline from the 10-year average of 5.2% growth, according to consulting firm Bain & Co.'s projections.</p><p>Consumers said they <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/03/holiday-shopping-gen-z-retailers.html\">plan to spend about 5% less</a> – or an average of $1,552 – on holiday gifts, travel and entertainment, compared with the year-ago season, according to a survey by consulting firm PwC, which included a representative sample of 4,000 U.S. consumers and was conducted in late June and early July. That projected spending, in particular, was <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/03/holiday-shopping-gen-z-retailers.html\">dragged down by members of Gen Z</a> saying that they planned to spend 23% less than the year-ago holiday season, according to PwC's survey.</p><p>Adobe expects the peak of holiday<strong> </strong>spending during Cyber Week, which stretches from Thanksgiving through the Monday after Thanksgiving that's dubbed Cyber Monday. That five-day period is expected to drive 17.2%, or $43.7 billion, of overall online holiday spending, Adobe said, roughly in line with the 17% that period accounted for in the year-ago holiday season.</p><p>Discounting levels will be roughly similar to the year-ago holiday season, Adobe predicted, with slightly weaker discounts in some categories. For example, discounts on electronics are expected to peak at 28% off the listed price compared with 30.1% in the year-ago period. Adobe expects toys to hit 27% off compared with 28% in the year-ago period.</p><p>Mobile devices will be the primary driver for online shopping, Adobe said, with the company expecting holiday shopping done there to account for 56.1% of online spending compared with desktops. It's a meaningful jump from the 40% of online spending that mobile devices represented during the 2020 holiday season.</p><p>As shoppers search for gifts, more are expected to turn to generative AI-powered chat services and browsers to research what toys, jewelry, clothing or other items to buy. Adobe expects AI traffic to rise by 520% year over year, with the busiest traffic days leading up to Thanksgiving.</p><p><em>Correction: Adobe expects the peak of holiday<strong> </strong>spending during Cyber Week, which stretches from Thanksgiving through the Monday after Thanksgiving that's dubbed Cyber Monday. An earlier version misstated a day.</em></p></div></div>",

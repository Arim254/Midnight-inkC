    "body": "A Walmart store is shown in  Oceanside, California, U.S., May 15, 2025. Mike Blake | ReutersWalmart is expected to report its fiscal fourth-quarter earnings on Thursday morning as the retail giant and its new CEO chase a future fueled more by digital businesses and artificial intelligence.Here's what Wall Street analysts surveyed by LSEG are expecting the company to report:Earnings per share: 73 cents expectedRevenue:  $190.43 billion expectedWalmart said in November that it expects full-year net sales to climb between 4.8% and 5.1% and adjusted earnings per share to range from $2.58 to $2.63. Investors are not only looking for a holiday and full-year recap. They're also eager for a better sense of the company's expectations for the year ahead and the priorities for new CEO John Furner, a more than three-decade-long company veteran and former Walmart U.S. CEO who succeeded Doug McMillon as Walmart's top executive on Feb. 1.As a retail behemoth, Walmart offers a key snapshot of the U.S. consumer — particularly since it kicks off a batch of earnings reports from other major retailers, including Home Depot and Target.\"Everybody likes to get a litmus test on how the consumer acted in the quarter and how they are acting quarter to date,\" said Kate McShane, a retail analyst for Goldman Sachs.She said Walmart could benefit from some helpful dynamics in the coming months, including tax cuts that were part of President Donald Trump's tax and spending bill last year that may free up more discretionary spending, especially for middle-income consumers. Yet there are other mixed indicators about the U.S. economy, such as lackluster retail sales numbers in December and concerns about the jobs market and artificial intelligence-related head count cuts, despite a better-than-expected jobs report for January. Investors have closely watched inflation and tried to gauge if tariffs will increase prices in the coming weeks and months, too.Investors largely expect Furner to focus on similar priorities as his predecessor McMillon, such as increasing Walmart's online business, attracting more customers across incomes and ramping up higher-margin businesses like its third-party marketplace and advertising.However, Walmart is expected to lose the title as the largest retailer by annual revenue on Thursday. Amazon already surpassed Walmart on quarterly revenue and it is on track to top Walmart on an annual basis. Amazon's core retail unit is the company's biggest revenue driver, but it gets a sizeable chunk of its business from its cloud computing, advertising and seller services businesses. Along with getting a new CEO, Walmart has hit other milestones lately. Its stock switched to the tech-heavy Nasdaq in December and its market value hit $1 trillion earlier this month.As of Wednesday's close, shares of the company have climbed about 22% over the past year and about 14% so far this year. That's outpaced the S&P 500's 12% gains over the past year and less than 1% gains year to date. ",

    "body": "U.S. President Donald Trump and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer hold a press conference following their meeting at Chequers, near Aylesbury, Britain, Sept. 18, 2025. Kevin Lamarque | ReutersU.S. President Donald Trump has once again criticized the U.K.'s plan to hand the Chagos Islands back to Mauritius, telling the country not to \"give away\" the territory where a strategic U.S.-U.K. military base is located. \"DO NOT GIVE AWAY DIEGO GARCIA!\" Trump posted on his Truth Social media platform on Wednesday, saying he'd been telling British Prime Minister Keir Starmer that he should \"not lose control, for any reason, of Diego Garcia.\"The U.K. agreed in May 2025 to hand sovereignty of the Chagos Islands to Mauritius, which has long-disputed the U.K.'s acquisition and ownership of the archipelago in the Indian Ocean. The deal would see the U.K. lease back the military base it shares with the U.S. on the largest island on the archipelago, Diego Garcia, for £101 million ($135.7 million) a year, for an initial 99-year period.The U.S. previously voiced support for the deal and, on Tuesday, the Department of State said it \"supports the decision of the United Kingdom to proceed with its agreement with Mauritius concerning the Chagos archipelago.\"Trump seesaws on the dealTrump is not the biggest fan of the Chagos deal, however, and he has seesawed on the issue of ceding the territory to Mauritius.In January, he called the deal \"an act of great stupidity,\" but he was more conciliatory in early February, stating: \"I understand that the deal Prime Minister Starmer has made, according to many, the best he could make,\" he commented on Truth Social.\"However, if the lease deal, sometime in the future, ever falls apart, or anyone threatens or endangers US operations and forces at our base, I retain the right to militarily secure and reinforce the American presence in Diego Garcia,\" he added.Diego Garcia, a British Indian Ocean Territory and the largest of the islands in the Chagos Archipelago on July 02, 2013 in Diego Garcia, British Indian Ocean Territory.USGS NASA | Gallo Images | Getty ImagesOn Wednesday, he returned to his negative position on the agreement, saying that he'd told Starmer \"that Leases are no good when it comes to Countries.\"\"He is making a big mistake by entering a 100 Year Lease with whoever it is that is 'claiming' Right, Title, and Interest to Diego Garcia, strategically located in the Indian Ocean,\" Trump said.The president suggested that giving the islands away was an act of \"Wokeism,\" as it had come after the U.K. faced sustained international and legal pressure to relinquish the islands, and to redress its thorny colonial history on the islands. \"We will always be ready, willing, and able to fight for the U.K., but they have to remain strong in the face of Wokeism, and other problems put before them,\" Trump said.The U.K. has repeatedly said that it \"will never compromise on our national security\" when it comes to the Chagos deal.Iran action?Trump also suggested Wednesday that the joint military base on the island could be vital if military action was taken against Iran — if the Islamic Republic did not agree a new nuclear deal during current talks with the U.S.\"Should Iran decide not to make a Deal, it may be necessary for the United States to use Diego Garcia, and the Airfield located in Fairford, in order to eradicate a potential attack by a highly unstable and dangerous Regime — An attack that would potentially be made on the United Kingdom, as well as other friendly Countries,\" Trump said.The U.S. and Mauritius are due to hold talks on the Chagos deal next week, from Feb. 23-25, with the U.S. Department of State noting that the discussions\" underscore the continued importance of the Chagos archipelago and the joint U.S.-U.K. base on Diego Garcia to our national security.\" \"The discussions will focus on bilateral security cooperation and effective implementation of security arrangements for the base to ensure its long-term, secure operation,\" the department said.",

    "body": "U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell speaks during a press conference following a two-day meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) on interest rate policy, in Washington, D.C., U.S., January 28, 2026. Jonathan Ernst | ReutersDivided Federal Reserve officials at their January meeting indicated that further interest rate cuts should be paused for now and could resume later in the year only if inflation cooperates.While the decision to hold the central bank's benchmark rate steady mostly was met with approval, the path ahead appeared less certain, with members conflicted between fighting inflation and supporting the labor market, according to minutes released Wednesday from the Jan. 27-28 Federal Open Market Committee meeting.\"In considering the outlook for monetary policy, several participants commented that further downward adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate would likely be appropriate if inflation were to decline in line with their expectations,\" the meeting summary said.However, meeting participants disagreed on where policy should head, with officials debating over whether the focus should be more on fighting inflation or supporting the labor market.\"Some participants commented that it would likely be appropriate to hold the policy rate steady for some time as the Committee carefully assesses incoming data, and a number of these participants judged that additional policy easing may not be warranted until there was clear indication that the progress of disinflation was firmly back on track,\" the minutes said.Moreover, some even entertained the notion that rate hikes could be on the table and wanted the post-meeting statement to more closely reflect \"a two-sided description of the Committee's future interest rate decisions.\"Such a description would have reflected \"the possibility that upward adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate could be appropriate if inflation remains at above-target levels.\"The Fed reduced its benchmark borrowing rate by three-quarters of a percentage point in consecutive cuts in September, October and December. Those moves put the key rate in a range between 3.5%-3.75%.The meeting was the first for a new voting cast of regional presidents, at least two of whom, Lorie Logan of Dallas and Beth Hammack of Cleveland, have publicly said they think they Fed should be on hold indefinitely. Both have said they see inflation as a continuing threat and should be the focus of policy now. All 19 governors and regional presidents participate at the meeting, but only 12 vote.With the Fed already split along ideological lines, the fissure could grow deeper if former Governor Kevin Warsh is confirmed as the next central bank chair. Warsh has spoken in favor of lower rates, a position also supported by current Governors Stephen Miran and Christopher Waller. Both Waller and Miran voted against the January decision, preferring instead another quarter-point cut. Current Chair Jerome Powell's term ends in May.The meeting minutes do not identify individual participants and featured an array of characterizations to describe positions, rotating between \"some,\" \"a few,\" \"many\" and even featured two rare references to \"a vast majority.\"Participants generally expected inflation to come down through the year, \"though the pace and timing of this decline remained uncertain.\" They noted the impact tariffs were having on prices and said they expected the impact to wane as the year goes by.\"Most participants, however, cautioned that progress toward the Committee's 2 percent objective might be slower and more uneven than generally expected and judged that the risk of inflation running persistently above the Committee's objective was meaningful,\" the document said.At the meeting, the rate-setting FOMC adjusted some of the language in its post-meeting statement. The changes noted that the risks to inflation and the labor market had come more closely into balance, softening prior worries over the employment picture.Since the meeting, labor data has been a mixed bag, with indications that private sector job creation is slowing further and that the meager growth is coming almost entirely from the health-care sector. However, the unemployment rate dipped to 4.3% in January and nonfarm payroll growth was stronger than expected.On inflation, the Fed's key personal consumption expenditures prices metric has been mired around 3%. However, a report last week showed that the consumer price index when excluding food and energy prices was at its lowest in nearly five years.Futures traders are placing the best bet for the next cut to come in June, with another in September or October, according to the CME Group's FedWatch gauge.",

The second trial regarding former President Yoon Suk-yeol's charge of leading a rebellion hold at the Seoul Central District Court. (Photo by Jung Yeon-Je - Pool/Getty Images)Pool | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesFormer South Korean president Yoon Suk Yeol was sentenced to life imprisonment Thursday after being found guilty of leading an insurrection during his declaration of martial law in December 2024. The ruling, delivered by Seoul Central District Court Judge Jee Kui-youn, was lighter than the death penalty prosecutors sought at the trial's final hearing in January. The ruling was aired live on South Korea's major broadcasters.Jee said in the verdict that Yoon led an insurrection and committed acts to subvert the country's constitutional order.The court added that Yoon \"took the lead in planning the crime and involved a large number of people,\" and that it was \"difficult to see any sign of remorse from the defendant, who also refused to appear in court.\"Yoon had previously reportedly refused to appear in court for questioning last year. The court also found Yoon had ordered South Korea's military to capture individuals during the martial law declaration, including the current president Lee Jae Myung. Yoon also had the intention to \"paralyze\" the country's parliament by deploying troops to blockade the National Assembly and arrest key politicians, Jee said.Five others were also sentenced, including former defense minister Kim Yong-hyun, who was sentenced to 30 years in prison.The defendants may appeal the ruling within a week. The sentence follows a separate ruling on Jan. 16, when Yoon was given a five-year prison term for attempting to obstruct his arrest after he was impeached and suspended from office. Other senior officials have been sentenced over the failed martial law bid. Former Prime Minister Han Duck-soo was sentenced to 23 years in prison, while former Interior Minister Lee Sang-min received a seven-year sentence.Yoon was the first sitting South Korean president to be arrested in an operation involving over 3,000 police personnel that involved a standoff with presidential security agents. Martial law attemptDuring the final hearing, special counsel Cho Eun-suk's team said Yoon declared martial law \"with the purpose of remaining in power for a long time by seizing the judiciary and legislature,\" according to South Korean media reports.Yoon reportedly maintained his innocence, arguing the declaration was within his constitutional authority and was intended to \"safeguard freedom and sovereignty.\"He imposed South Korea's first instance of martial law in 44 years during a late-night address on Dec. 3, claiming that the then-opposition Democratic Party of Korea was engaging in \"anti-state activities\" and colluding with \"North Korean communists.\"Troops were deployed to the country's National Assembly, while soldiers and police clashed with protesters outside the compound. Television footage showed special forces breaking windows to gain access to the chamber, while parliamentary staffers used furniture to barricade doors.Then-defense minister Kim Yong-hyun also reportedly ordered troops to \"pull people inside the National Assembly building outside.\"But the martial law order was overturned within three hours, after 190 of the 300 National Assembly lawmakers gathered in the chamber and unanimously voted to do so. Yoon eventually lifted martial law about six hours after announcing it.He was impeached 11 days later and removed from office on April 4, 2025. ",

Kevin Carter | Getty ImagesMortgage interest rates dropped last week to the lowest level in a month, prompting more current borrowers to seek savings in a refinance. While lower rates didn't give potential buyers much incentive, the run on refinances was enough to push total mortgage demand 2.8% higher compared with the previous week, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association's seasonally adjusted index. The average contract interest rate for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages with conforming loan balances, $832,750 or less, decreased to 6.17% from 6.21%, with points remaining unchanged at 0.56, including the origination fee, for loans with a 20% down payment. \"Treasury yields ended the week lower as weaker data on retail sales and home sales outweighed better-than-expected readings on the job market for January,\" said Joel Kan, vice president and deputy chief economist at the MBA, in a release. As a result, applications to refinance a home loan rose 7% for the week and were 132% higher than the same week one year ago. Last year, rates were 76 basis points higher. While that annual jump may seem large, refinancing was at extremely low levels at this time last year. \"Refinance applications increased across all loan types, marking the strongest week for refinancing since mid-January,\" Kan added.Get Property Play directly to your inboxCNBC's Property Play with Diana Olick covers new and evolving opportunities for the real estate investor, delivered weekly to your inbox.Subscribe here to get access today.Applications for a mortgage to purchase a home dropped 3% for the week and were just 8% higher than the same week one year ago. While lower mortgage rates are making homes slightly more affordable, new supply is not coming onto the market fast enough, and concern over the broader economy has consumers sitting on the sidelines. Mortgage rates didn't move at all to start this holiday-shortened week, but economic data set for release this week could impact the current trajectory. In general, however, mortgage rates have been hovering in a pretty narrow range, between 6% and 6.25%, since the start of this year. ",

For 2026, Nestle said it is targeting organic sales growth of 3% to 4%, along with an improvement in its underlying trading operating profit margin, which stood at 16.1% in 2025.The Vevey, Switzerland-based company also announced it was planning to sell its remaining ice cream business to Haagen-Dazs owner Froneri, a joint venture by PAI and Nestle. In addition, Nestle said it started the formal process to shed its water business earlier in the first quarter, and expects the business, which holds brands such as Henniez and Perrier to be deconsolidated by 2027. The company, under its new leadership duo of CEO Philipp Navratil and Chairman Pablo Isla, a former Inditex executive, have been focusing on streamlining the sprawling consumer giant, after years of operational and share-price underperformance. \"We are accelerating our strategy. We are focusing our portfolio on four businesses, led by our strongest brands, with prioritized resources and a simplified organization,\" Navratil said in a statement.An infant formula recall, which has also engulfed rival Danone and privately held Lactalis in France, has provided a stumbling block for restoring trust in the business. Nestle said Thursday its organic growth guidance includes a negative 20 basis point impact from the recall and flagged 1.7 billion francs in restructuring items, mainly due to the recall. ",

    "body": "watch nowWhite House economic advisor Kevin Hassett said Wednesday that the authors of a recent New York Federal Reserve paper that found U.S. companies and consumers are shouldering most of the tariff burden should be \"disciplined.\"In a CNBC interview, the National Economic Council director ripped the report, saying that central bank researchers ignored key aspects of how the duties worked and instead simply focused on prices. Hassett said the research also should have included the upward impact on wages and benefits that U.S. companies see by bringing more production onshore.\"I mean, the paper is an embarrassment,\" Hassett said during the \"Squawk Box\" interview. \"It's, I think, the worst paper I've ever seen in the history of the Federal Reserve system. The people associated with this paper should presumably be disciplined, because what they've done is they've put out a conclusion which has created a lot of news that's highly partisan based on analysis that wouldn't be accepted in a first-semester econ class.\"The paper in question was published Feb. 12 on the New York Fed's website.Essentially, the researchers looked at whether countries that export products to the U.S. were lowering their prices, or in effect eating the tariffs, or raising their prices and passing them onto consumers and companies. The paper found that some 90% of the added costs from tariffs were being passed on, though it noted that the impact waned slightly as the year progressed.However, Hassett insisted that the tariffs had little impact on prices and were responsible for a better standard of living.\"Prices have gone down. Inflation is down over time. Import prices dropped a lot in the first half of the year, that leveled off, and real wages were up $1,400 on average last year, which means that consumers were made better off by the tariffs,\" he said. \"So consumers couldn't have been made better off by the tariffs, if this New York Fed analysis was correct. It's really just an embarrassment. I can't imagine who signed off on it.\"The consumer price index in January rose 2.4% from a year ago and is up nearly 2% from April 2025, when President Donald Trump first announced the tariffs. The core CPI, which excludes food and energy, was up 2.5% in January, its lowest annual gain since March 2021. Import prices in December were flat from a year ago while export prices rose 3.1%, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.A New York Fed official declined comment.",

    "body": "U.S. President Donald Trump disembarks Air Force One at Palm Beach International Airport in West Palm Beach, Florida, U.S., Feb. 13, 2026. Elizabeth Frantz | ReutersThe Trump administration has warned it would be \"very wise\" for Iran to make a deal, amid reports the White House is considering fresh military action against Tehran as soon as this weekend. It comes shortly after Vice President JD Vance accused Iran of failing to address core U.S. demands during nuclear talks in Switzerland this week. Iran's foreign minister previously reported progress in the talks, saying the two countries had reached an understanding over the \"guiding principles\" for the negotiations.Speaking at a news briefing Wednesday, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said there were \"many reasons and arguments that once could make for a strike against Iran,\" noting that the two countries remain \"very far apart\" on some issues.The U.S. president had a \"very successful\" operation last June, Leavitt said, when U.S. stealth bombers struck three Iranian nuclear facilities as part of \"Operation Midnight Hammer.\"\"The president has always been very clear though with respect to Iran or any country around the world, diplomacy is always his first option. And Iran would be very wise to make a deal with President Trump and this administration,\" Leavitt said. The White House has said it still hopes to reach a diplomatic resolution over Tehran's nuclear program, although U.S. media has reported that the military could be prepared to strike Iran as early as the weekend. 'Extremely dangerous' situationBoth the U.S. and Iran have increased military activity in the oil-producing Middle East region in recent weeks.The U.S., for its part, has built up a significant presence of air and naval assets, while Iran has conducted military drills in the strategically vital Strait of Hormuz and announced joint naval drills with Russia in the Sea of Oman.Laura James, Middle East senior analyst at Oxford Analytica, described the current situation as \"extremely dangerous,\" with the U.S. and Iran \"certainly closer\" to an outright conflict than last week.watch now\"The thing that is now a particular concern over the past 24 hours is the very rapid pace at which the United States is reinforcing its air power in the region. That, of course, can still be signalling and pressure for a particular diplomatic outcome,\" James told CNBC's \"Access Middle East\" on Thursday.\"But as more and more planes comes in and more and more equipment comes in, that signalling gets more and more expensive. And therefore, the payoff you want for it in diplomatic terms has to be larger — and there is simply no sign Tehran can offer the absolute minimum that Washington is likely to demand,\" she added.  Oil pricesEnergy market participants have been closely watching the outcome of the U.S.-Iran talks in Geneva, particularly as it relates to the Strait of Hormuz, a major international waterway that Iran partially closed on Tuesday citing \"security precautions.\" Located in the gulf between Oman and Iran, the Strait of Hormuz is recognized as one of the world's most important oil choke points.Iranian military personnel take part in an exercise titled 'Smart Control of the Strait of Hormuz', launched by the Naval Forces of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, is being carried out in the Persian Gulf and the Strait of Hormuz on February 16, 2026.Anadolu | Anadolu | Getty ImagesAbout 13 million barrels per day of crude oil transited the Strait of Hormuz in 2025, accounting for roughly 31% of global seaborne crude flows, data provided by market intelligence firm Kpler showed. Oil prices were higher on Thursday morning, extending gains after settling up more than 4% in the previous session. International benchmark Brent crude futures with April delivery rose 0.7% to $70.81 per barrel, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate futures with March delivery stood 0.6% higher at $65.58.— CNBC's Lee Ying Shan contributed to this report.",

    "body": "David Solomon, CEO Goldman Sachs, speaking on CNBC's Squawk Box at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland on Jan. 22nd, 2026. \nOscar Molina | CNBCGoldman Sachs CEO David Solomon said Wednesday \"it is very, very important that we codify a rule-based system\" for how cryptocurrency and related financial instruments will operate\" in the United States.\"As an American, I think it is very important that as we put legislation in place, we get it right for the long term,\" Solomon told CNBC's Sara Eisen during an interview in front of attendees at the World Liberty Forum at the Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Fla., which was hosted by the Trump family's crypto venture World Liberty Financial.\"I believe that to operate markets safely and soundly, we need to have a rules-based system,\" said Solomon, whose firm is one of the world's premier traditional investment banks. \"Our banking system is unique, and our banking system needs to coexist with this technological innovation.\"\"If there are people who think we are going to operate in this environment without rules, they are probably wrong, and they should move to El Salvador,\" Solomon said. The CEO was echoing a comment that Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent made during testimony on Feb. 5 to the Senate Banking Committee backing a cryptocurrency market bill structure bill, the CLARITY Act.El Salvador's government has purchased bitcoin since 2022. Because of the decline in bitcoin's price, the value of El Salvador's holdings of that cryptocurrency has fallen to about $500 million, down from a high of $800 million last year.Solomon commented weeks after a Senate committee advanced the CLARITY ACT, which would create a national regulatory structure for crypto.That bill has stalled over a dispute about whether digital asset companies would be allowed to offer customers rewards, or payments on stablecoins that are held in those companies. Banks have opposed such rewards, which could compete with their interest payments on depositors' accounts.\"We have to get this CLARITY Act across the finish line,\" Bessent said during his testimony at the Banking Committee after Sen. Cynthia Lummis, R-Wyo., asked his opinion on the importance of having \"clear rules of the road\" for cryptocurrency in the U.S.Solomon said Wednesday that he is \"super-interested in\" crypto-related business.Read more CNBC politics coverageBillionaire Les Wexner's congressional deposition over Jeffrey Epstein ties is underwayTrump administration sued for Stonewall Pride flag removal in New YorkPotomac River sewage spill: Trump says Democrats need to ask for his helpStephen Colbert says CBS blocked James Talarico interview from air\"We obviously are doing a bunch of things around digitization and tokenization,\" he said.\"We touch all that stuff,\" Solomon said.But, he added, \"it doesn't mean it's central to what we do. These kinds of assets are still a small percentage\" of Goldman's business.\"We have clients, our clients have needs, we're here to serve our clients.\"Sen. Bernie Moreno, R-Ohio, earlier Wednesday at the conference, told Eisen on CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" that he still has \"some concerns\" about the crypto market structure bill, but \"hopefully by April\" it will be passed by Congress and be able to be signed by President Donald Trump.Moreno brushed aside concerns that if the bill is not passed soon, it could die because of the chance that Democrats would regain majority control of the Senate and House of Representatives. Republicans are increasingly fearful they will lose control of at least the House in November's midterm elections.\"The House isn't going to go Democrat, and neither is the Senate,\" Moreno predicted.Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong, when asked about the crypto bill, said \"there is now a path forward where we can get a win-win-win outcome here: a win for the crypto industry, and a win for the banks, and a win for the American consumer to get President Trump's crypto agenda through to the finish line so we can make America the crypto capital of the world.\"",

    "body": "The Etsy Inc. headquarters in the Brooklyn borough of New York on June 25, 2024.Victor J. Blue | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesEtsy shares skyrocketed more than 14% in extended trading on Wednesday after the company announced eBay would acquire its secondhand clothing reseller Depop for about $1.2 billion in cash.The deal comes almost five years after Etsy bought Depop for roughly $1.62 billion, giving the online marketplace an edge into younger consumers who flocked to the U.K.-founded app to hawk their used clothing, shoes, accessories and other goods. About 90% of Depop's users are under the age of 34, Etsy said.\"We are excited that this transaction allows us to focus exclusively on the compelling opportunity we see in front of us: to grow the Etsy marketplace in ways that matter most to our buyers and sellers,\" Etsy CEO Kruti Patel Goyal said in a statement. The transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of this year. In recent years, Etsy snapped up several niche online marketplaces as part of a \"house of brands\" strategy to compete with bigger, faster-growing rivals like Amazon. But it's since unwound many of those deals, including Brazilian e-commerce company Elo7 in 2023 and musical instrument marketplace Reverb last year.Read more CNBC tech newsSnap to launch creator subscriptions in push to diversify revenueAlibaba unveils Qwen3.5 as China's chatbot race shifts to AI agentsByteDance says it will add safeguards to Seedance 2.0 following Hollywood backlashAnthropic got an 11% user boost from its OpenAI-bashing Super Bowl ad, data showsEtsy has struggled to grow its business since the pandemic e-commerce boom, while it contends with stiff competition from Amazon, Shopify and ultracheap online marketplaces like Temu, Shein and TikTok Shop. On its core platform, Etsy saw active buyers and gross merchandise volume decline year over year in 2024, a trend that continued last year. The company has also borne the brunt of President Donald Trump's tariff policies and a tough macroeconomic environment that led to a pullback in discretionary spending among consumers. EBay CEO Jamie Iannone said Depop would allow the 30-year-old company to grow its presence in fashion.\"This acquisition presents an opportunity to advance one of our newest and fastest-growing Focus Categories with a marketplace that complements our existing presence, and enables us to reach a younger demographic across the expanding recommerce landscape,\" Iannone said in a statement.Shares of eBay surged more than 8% in extended trading following the news, which was announced alongside the company's fourth-quarter earnings results. EBay reported adjusted earnings per share of $1.41 on revenue of $2.97 billion, surpassing analyst estimates of $1.34 per share and $2.88 billion, according to LSEG. Sales increased 15% from a year ago.Gross merchandise volume, or the dollar value of items sold, grew 10% year over year to $21.2 billion, above Wall Street expectations for $20.8 billion.For the first quarter, eBay said it expects to post adjusted earnings per share between $1.53 and $1.59 on revenue in the range of $3 billion and $3.05 billion. Analysts anticipated $1.48 per share and $2.8 billion in sales. ",

    "body": "Donald Trump Jr. (L) and Eric Trump speaking on Squawk on the Street on Feb. 18, 2026.CNBCSince the dollar was created in 1792, U.S. presidents and their families have generally been content with the status quo of effectively giving the national government a monopoly on issuing currency and outlawing the use of foreign currency.Consider the launch of the dollar the country's Initial Coin Offering. Back when the U.S. government was hustling to surpass the dominance of the Spanish pieces of eight then in common circulation throughout the country.When presidents have said anything about the dollar itself, it was generally to reiterate the U.S. government's \"strong dollar\" policy.That continued more or less uninterrupted through 46 presidencies  — until last March, when a company partly owned by President Donald Trump and his family began to market an alternative to the dollar, a cryptocurrency dubbed \"USD1.\"Now, the president's two oldest sons are telling CNBC on the sidelines of a day-long crypto event they hosted why that should change.Marketed as a stablecoin, USD1's value would track the dollar, much as the dollar when it was created in 1792 was initially pegged to the value of the then-dominant Spanish silver dollar.The Trumps' company, World Liberty Financial, touts USD1 as an improvement on official U.S. currency. The firm's website brands its stablecoin as \"The Dollar. Upgraded.\" And it calls the coin \"still the US dollar, but for a new era.\"On Wednesday, the firm held its first World Liberty Forum at Mar-a-Lago, the club owned by President Trump and operated as his winter White House.The event, coming just before the first anniversary of the release of USD1, brought together financiers, technologists, television personalities, the president of the world soccer organization FIFA and the artist Nicki Minaj.From a Mar-a-Lago ballroom stage beneath an enormous stylized golden eagle sculpture, the message to attendees was that the old U.S. dollar needs to be modernized, that the private sector is the place to drive that innovation, and that stablecoins will help taxpayers by creating structural demand for U.S. government debt.In fact, World Liberty backers argue, the new cryptocurrency they are building is not a threat to the dollar at all, but will help ensure the dollar remains dominant in global crypto finance – because USD1's value is pegged to it.But one big question is why, if the dollar needs modernizing, should that be done by the private sector.Read more CNBC politics coverageBillionaire Les Wexner's congressional deposition over Jeffrey Epstein ties is underwayTrump administration sued for Stonewall Pride flag removal in New YorkPotomac River sewage spill: Trump says Democrats need to ask for his helpStephen Colbert says CBS blocked James Talarico interview from airAnd why should the venture be in the private hands of the president and his family, and not in the hands of the U.S. Treasury.CNBC put those questions to the president's sons, World Liberty Financial's co-founders, Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump, in a small event space just off Mar-a-Lago's swimming pool.\"This is actually going to preserve dollar hegemony,\" Donald Trump Jr. replied.\"There's crypto companies that are the top five buyers in the world,\" he said. \"That's going to actually stabilize the US dollar and do all the things that we need to.\"He argued the federal government — and the big Wall Street banking system — simply aren't nimble or innovative enough to drive the needed changes.\"We're going to lead the way as Americans,\" Eric Trump said. \"You're going to leave that to who, JPMorgan, to do? You're going to leave that to the federal government to do?\"Eric Trump sees Wall Street as overly complacent – and therefore ripe for technological disruption.\"Do you think big banks will actually do this?\" he asked. \"And the reason I say this is, I mean, it's been 50 years, where bankers are working six hours a day. They have a two-hour lunch break. They're typically out of the office at four o'clock in the afternoon.\"Eric and Donald Jr. make it clear the animating force behind their venture is not the inventor's glee at building a better mousetrap or the insider's frustration at legacy companies that can't or won't adapt to the future.Instead, what's driving them is a raw sense of retribution.The Trump brothers see the wider financial system as part of an establishment that unfairly ostracized them after their father left power in 2021, when, after the Jan. 6, 2021, U.S. Capitol riot, the banking system broadly declined to do business with the Trump family.\"You know, we didn't get into crypto because we were on the leading edge,\" Donald Trump Jr. said in an interview Wednesday with CNBC's Sara Eisen. \"We got into it out of necessity. They basically forced us into it.\"Eric Trump told Eisen, \"We were the most cancelled people in the world in 2020, 2021 and it's really great to almost have this retribution where all of a sudden we start pushing an agenda.\"\"Our agenda was to modernize finance, to allow that to never ever, ever happen to anybody again,\" Eric Trump said.Donald Trump Jr. said he concluded that the traditional banking system is a \"Ponzi scheme.\"\"They created this monster,\" Trump Jr. said, pointing to the moment when he claimed \"when you had every big bank in the world, for doing nothing wrong,\" \"debank\" Trump accounts and those of other conservatives, \"just based on the fact that we all wore a hat that said 'Make America Great Again.'\"Eric Trump recalled his father's time out of the White House between presidential terms as a traumatizing period for the family.\"These are commercial buildings, residential buildings, golf courses around the world. These aren't political entities, and they were pulling these accounts from us like we were absolute dogs,\" Eric Trump said.\"We couldn't pay our vendors, we couldn't pay our employees. And so we said, listen, there has to be a better way.\"To Eric Trump, the message is that the Trump family will always counterpunch: When social media companies kicked his father off their platforms, President Trump created his own Truth Social media platform. And when the banking industry declined Trump family business, the family took matters into their own hands.And that's why a president's family, for the first time since 1792, is creating an upgraded American currency.Call it Truth Dollar.",

    "body": "President Donald Trump stops and talks to the media before he boards Marine One on the South Lawn at the White House in Washington, June 15, 2025.Tasos Katopodis | Getty ImagesPresident Donald Trump is escalating his crusade for voter identification requirements after last week's promise of an executive order to implement such a mandate before November's midterm elections.White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt in a briefing Wednesday said Trump is \"discussing and exploring legal options for a potential executive order with respect to voter ID,\" days after Trump said he would find a way to require voters to present identification across the U.S., \"whether approved by Congress or not!\"Leavitt's comments followed a Tuesday night Trump Truth Social post of an article about a local elected official urging the Georgia state government to take over voting in Fulton County, the target of a recent FBI raid and a precinct that Trump lost to Joe Biden in 2020. Trump is planning to travel to a different part of Georgia on Thursday to talk about the economy.Trump's recent fixation on elections and congressional Republicans' willingness to largely fall in line are raising alarms for Democrats and voting rights groups, who see the recent moves as a potential existential threat to American elections and an extension of Trump's past election denialism. The topic has apparently been front of mind for the president. In a series of reposts on Truth Social that followed his initial post Wednesday, Trump shared unfounded claims about irregularities in the 2020 election. \"[Democrats] don't want voter ID because they want to cheat at elections,\" Trump told reporters on Air Force One on Monday. \"If you had voter ID, if you had proof of citizenship, they could never win an election. And they know that. And they're fighting them to the hilt.\"Read more CNBC politics coverageBillionaire Les Wexner's congressional deposition over Jeffrey Epstein ties is underwayTrump administration sued for Stonewall Pride flag removal in New YorkPotomac River sewage spill: Trump says Democrats need to ask for his helpStephen Colbert says CBS blocked James Talarico interview from air\"When [Republicans] win an election, they win fair and square,\" Rep. Greg Stanton, D-Ariz., said in an interview this week. \"But then when they lose elections, Donald Trump likes to say it was based on fraud.\"Stanton is the chair of the New Democrat Coalition Action Fund, a political action committee that works to get moderate Democrats elected to the U.S. House. He called Trump's threat to unilaterally impose voter ID requirements \"purely bluster.\"Rep. Joe Morelle, D-N.Y., the top Democrat on the House Administration Committee, similarly said \"the Constitution is pretty clear.\"\"Time, place and manner of elections shall be up to the states … Congress may at its discretion get involved as well. But there's no role for the president,\" Morelle said in an interview Wednesday.SAVE America Act moves to the SenateMeanwhile, support is growing among the Senate GOP for a bill that would require proof of citizenship to register to vote and the presenting of identification to cast a ballot.The SAVE America Act targets noncitizen voting, which is already illegal and exceedingly rare, and requires voter ID. It advanced out of the House last week on a 218-213 vote, with just one Democrat, Rep. Henry Cuellar of Texas, voting in favor. Both of the bill's main components are broadly popular, according to public polling. But opponents say the legislation could disenfranchise millions and create barriers to voting for minorities, college students and married women who changed their last names.While some congressional Republicans have shown a willingness to buck Trump in recent months on things like tariffs and Affordable Care Act subsidies, most have followed his lead on elections.Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, is the lone Senate Republican to publicly oppose the bill, while nearly all of her GOP colleagues have signed on.Still, the measure faces an uphill climb in the Senate, where rules require 60 votes to overcome a filibuster, meaning more than a handful of Democrats would have to vote with their Republican colleagues to advance the legislation.GOP proponents of the bill, including its lead sponsor Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, have called for changing the filibuster rule to allow a simple majority to prevail. Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., has promised a vote on the SAVE America Act, which he supports, but has been cool to the idea of changing the filibuster. Meanwhile, a second, even broader election reform proposal has cropped up in the House. In addition to requiring voter ID and proof of citizenship, the Make Elections Great Again Act, introduced by Rep. Bryan Steil, R-Wis., in January, would disqualify mail-in ballots received after the close of polls on Election Day, require states to use auditable paper ballots, and ban ballot harvesting, ranked choice voting and universal vote-by-mail. A spokesperson for House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., declined to comment when asked if the speaker planned to bring the MEGA Act to the floor, instead referring to the speaker's past comments on the passage of the SAVE America Act. The House Administration Committee, which Steil chairs, held a hearing on the MEGA Act last week.During a recent appearance on Fox Business after House passage of the SAVE America Act, Steil said Republicans \"need to build on that work.\"\"I think we need to clean up our voter rolls. I think we should make sure that ballots are in by the end of Election Day. We need proper, auditable ballots. The list goes on,\" Steil said.",

    "body": "US President Donald Trump speaks during a Black History Month event in the East Room of the White House in Washington, DC, on Feb. 18, 2026. Saul Loeb | AFP | Getty ImagesPresident Donald Trump on Wednesday issued an executive order invoking the Defense Production Act to promote the domestic production of phosphorus and the weedkiller glyphosate, which he said is critical to both defense and food security.Glyphosate is often targeted by supporters of the Make America Healthy Again movement as a harmful chemical. Trump aligned with the MAHA movement after Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr. dropped out of the 2024 election.\"I find that ensuring robust domestic elemental phosphorus mining and United States-based production of glyphosate-based herbicides is central to American economic and national security,\" Trump said in the order. \"Without immediate Federal action, the United States remains inadequately equipped and vulnerable.\"Read more CNBC politics coverageBillionaire Les Wexner's congressional deposition over Jeffrey Epstein ties is underwayTrump administration sued for Stonewall Pride flag removal in New YorkPotomac River sewage spill: Trump says Democrats need to ask for his helpStephen Colbert says CBS blocked James Talarico interview from airGlyphosate has long been used in U.S. agriculture and has been the subject of controversy over alleged links to cancer. Bayer, the company that makes the glyphosate-based weedkiller Roundup, recently proposed paying $7.25 billion to settle lawsuits claiming the chemical causes cancer.Roundup products are seen for sale at a store in San Rafael, California.Josh Edelson | AFP | Getty ImagesPhosphorus, which is also covered in the order, is a precursor to the production of glyphosate and is also used in the manufacturing of certain military equipment. The order will require Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins to issue orders and regulations to implement the increased supply of phosphorus and glyphosate.A White House Fact sheet on the executive order said Trump signed it to \"ensure domestic production of elemental phosphorus and glyphosate-based herbicides, the loss of which would cripple critical supply chains.\"A lack of either chemical, the fact sheet said, could \"leave our defense industrial base and food supply vulnerable to hostile foreign actors,\" since there is only \"one domestic producer of elemental phosphorus and glyphosate-based herbicides.\"Kennedy once won a nearly $290 million case against Roundup producer Monsanto, which has since been bought by Bayer, for a man who alleged he developed cancer from using the weedkiller. Since being nominated as Trump's HHS chief, however, he has softened his tone on the chemical. \"We cannot take any step that will put a single farmer in this country out of business,\" he said during a hearing last year. \"There's a million farmers who rely on glyphosate.\"CNBC has reached out to HHS for comment. Monsanto said in a statement to CNBC that the executive order \"reinforces the critical need for U.S. farmers to have access to essential, domestically produced crop protection tools such as glyphosate.\"  \"We will comply with this order to produce glyphosate and elemental phosphorus,\" the company said.

According to internal documents viewed by CNBC, working remotely for even a single day will now count for a full week.</p><p>\"Whether you log 1 WFA day or 5 WFA days in a given standard work week, 1 WFA week will be deducted from your WFA weekly balance,\" according to a document that was circulated over the summer, shortly before the change went into effect.</p><p>Google isn't altering its current hybrid schedule, which was also put in place during the pandemic, allowing employees to work from home two days a week. WFA days are distinct from that policy, giving staffers the flexibility to work remotely, but not at home.</p><p>\"WFA weeks cannot be used to work from home or nearby,\" the document says.</p><p>Google didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.</p><p>Tech companies are increasingly forcing employees to spend more time in the office, with the peak of Covid now about five years in the past. <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/MSFT/\">Microsoft</a><span><span></span></span></span> said last month that employees will be expected to work in an office three days a week starting next year, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/09/microsoft-says-employees-will-be-expected-in-office-three-days-a-week.html\">switching</a> from a policy that allowed most of them to work from home <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/09/microsoft-implements-new-hybrid-remote-work-policy.html\">50% of the time</a> or more with manager approval. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/AMZN/\">Amazon</a> went further, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2024/09/16/amazon-jassy-tells-employees-to-return-to-office-five-days-a-week.html\">instructing</a> corporate staffers to spend five days a week in the office.</p><p>Google began offering some U.S. full-time employees <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/27/google-makes-cuts-to-hr-and-cloud-units.html\">voluntary buyouts</a> at the beginning of 2025, and has <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/04/23/google-teams-are-including-remote-workers-in-their-cuts.html\">notified</a> remote workers from several units their jobs would be considered for layoffs if they didn't return to offices to work a hybrid schedule.</p><p>According to the latest changes, employees can't work from a Google office in a separate state or country during their WFA time due to \"legal and financial implications of cross border work.\" If in a different location, employees may be required to work during the business hours that align with that time zone, the rules state.</p><p>The WFA update doesn't apply to all Google staffers and may exclude data center workers, and those who are required to be in physical offices. Violations of the policy will result in disciplinary action or termination, the document says.</p><p>The issue came up at a recent all-hands meeting.</p><p>A top-rated question that was submitted on Google's internal system described the update as \"confusing.\"</p><p>\"Why does even one day of WFA count as a whole week, and can we reconsider the restriction on using WFA weeks to work from home?\" the question said.</p><p>John Casey, Google's vice president of performance and rewards, said at the meeting that WFA \"was meant to meet Googlers where they were during the pandemic,\" according to audio obtained by CNBC.</p><p>\"The policy was always intended to be taken in increments of a week and not be used as a substitute for working from home in a regular hybrid workweek,\" Casey said.</p><p><strong>WATCH:</strong> <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/video/2025/09/18/google-adds-gemini-to-chrome-for-all-users-in-push-to-bolster-ai-search.html\">Google adds Gemini to Chrome for all users in push to bolster AI search</a></p></div><div><p><img src=\"https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/108200857-1758216170719-Screenshot_2025-09-18_at_12237_PM.png?v=1758216195&w=750&h=422&vtcrop=y\" alt=\"Google adds Gemini to Chrome for all users in push to bolster AI search\" /><span></span><span><div><p><span>watch now</span><span></span></p></div></span></p></div></div>",

Flights have been grounded, jets scrambled, and countermeasures deployed to ensure the safety of our citizens,\" von der Leyen said Wednesday during a speech to the European Parliament in Strasbourg, France.</p><p>\"Make no mistake.

Across our Union, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2024/11/28/explainer-baltic-sea-undersea-cable-cuts-stoke-geopolitical-tensions.html\">undersea cables have been cut</a>, airports and logistics hubs paralysed by cyberattacks, and elections targeted by malign influence campaigns,\" von der Leyen said, adding emphatically: \"This is hybrid warfare, and we have to take it very seriously.\"</p><p>While she did not blame all those incidents directly on Moscow, von der Leyen said it was evident that \"Russia wants to sow division.\"</p><p>Moscow has long been accused of being behind a multitude of \"hybrid\" attacks against its European neighbors but has repeatedly denied those accusations. CNBC contacted the Kremlin for a response to von der Leyen's latest remarks and is awaiting a response.</p></div><h2><a></a>What is hybrid warfare?</h2><div><p>So what is a hybrid war, or warfare? Put simply, it's a way to wage a type of warfare without appearing to be doing so.</p><p>There is no set definition for hybrid warfare but defense, military and security experts agree that, fundamentally, it blends conventional military methods with more subversive or irregular tactics designed to disrupt, distract and undermine adversaries.</p></div><div><p>US marines look on from aboard the USS Mesa Verde ship during the Northern Coasts 2023 exercise in the Baltic Sea, September 18, 2023.</p><p>Janis Laizans | Reuters</p></div><div><p>European countries on the periphery of the EU, or those on the frontier with Russia, like the Baltic states Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, or those in Eastern Europe such as Romania and Poland, have been increasingly exposed to hybrid warfare attacks.</p><p>These incidents have ranged from energy and telecommunications infrastructure, such as undersea cables, being sabotaged, to Russian jets or submarines venturing into NATO airspace or waters for short periods of time.</p><p>Russia has denied being behind many of these incidents, although it tends not to comment on its jets entering NATO airspace or drone incidents <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/01/what-is-the-drone-wall-that-europe-wants.html\">that led to Danish airports being closed and flights disrupted</a>. A number of European officials accused Russia of being behind the disruption but national authorities often say it's difficult to find solid evidence of Russian involvement.</p><p>That's one of the hallmarks of hybrid warfare, the EU's von der Leyen said, with such incidents \"calculated to linger in the twilight of deniability.\"</p></div><div><p>A sign warns about a no-fly zone in Copenhagen, Denmark, on September 29, 2025.

Of these incidents, 86% have taken place since early 2022 and almost half (46%) occurred in 2024 alone.</p><p>The Baltic states, Finland, Germany, Norway, Poland and the U.K. will probably remain the primary targets, the report noted, due to their strong support for Ukraine.</p></div><h2><a></a>Europe says it's ready to act</h2><div><p>European officials are under no illusion that the time to act to bolster regional security and defenses against malign activities is now.</p><p>NATO members earlier this year pledged to increase defense spending to 5% of gross domestic product and Europe has vowed to mobilize its defense sector to meet <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/01/russia-has-become-a-permanent-security-threat-to-europe-luxembourg-pm-says.html\">the \"permanent threat to European security\" that's posed by Russia</a>, as Luxembourg Prime Minister Luc Frieden told CNBC last week.</p><p>Member states discussed last week the creation of \"flagship\" defense projects such as the Eastern Flank Watch initiative, which proposes the creation of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/01/what-is-the-drone-wall-that-europe-wants.html\">a \"drone wall\" network</a> that would protect against airspace violations by unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs).

letters came as the Trump administration continues to face pressure — from Democrats and from some of President <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/donald-trump/\">Donald Trump</a>'s Republican supporters — over its handling of matters related to Epstein.</p><p>The wealthy financier and sex offender, who was once a friend of Trump's, died by suicide while in jail facing federal child sex trafficking charges in 2019.</p><p>In his letters, Raskin bluntly asked each CEO if their bank will \"help reveal the truth\" about Epstein and his co-conspirators, or if they would \"choose to be part of the cover-up for this massive, international sex trafficking ring that victimized more than 1,000 women and girls?\"</p><p>Deutsche Bank, in a statement to CNBC, said that it \"takes its legal obligations seriously, including appropriately responding to authorized investigations and proceedings.\" The statement did not explicitly commit to complying with Raskin's requests.</p><p>\"The bank regrets our historical connection with Jeffrey Epstein,\" Deutsche Bank said. \"We have cooperated with regulatory and law enforcement agencies regarding their investigations and have been transparent in addressing deficiencies and investing in strengthening our control environment in parallel.\"</p><p>JPMorgan declined to comment on Raskin's request.</p><p>The congressman, in his letter to Dimon, emphasized that the CEO recently said, referring to Epstein, that he and JPMorgan \"regret any association with that man at all.\"</p><p>Raskin also noted that Dimon had committed to providing information to the Judiciary Committee.</p><p>But Dimon had specified that he would comply with a subpoena, saying, \"If it's a legal requirement, we would conform to it. We have no issue with that.\"</p><p>JPMorgan and Deutsche Bank have both paid substantial sums to settle lawsuits accusing them of facilitating and financially benefiting from sex trafficking by their client, Epstein.</p><p>In 2023, JPMorgan agreed to pay $290 million to settle a class-action lawsuit on behalf of Epstein victims and reached a $75 million settlement in a separate case brought by the U.S. Virgin Islands.</p><p>The same year, Deutsche Bank agreed to<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2023/05/18/jeffrey-epstein-lawsuit-deutsche-bank-will-pay-75-million-to-victims.html\"> pay $75 million</a> to Epstein victims to settle a suit.</p><p>Bank of America and BNY Mellon did not respond to CNBC's requests for comment on Raskin's letters to their CEOs.</p><p>Raskin wrote that he was sending the letters after Republicans, who hold a majority on the Judiciary panel voted against Democratic members' <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/09/17/congress/dems-fail-to-subpoena-major-banks-in-epstein-case-00569352\" target=\"_blank\">attempt to issue subpoenas</a> to the four bank CEOs last month.</p><p>The subpoena effort fell in a nearly party-line vote. Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky was the only Republican to vote in favor of the subpoenas.</p><p>The request for subpoenas came at the end of a hearing with FBI Director Kash Patel, whom Democrats grilled about the Trump administration's handling of the so-called Epstein files.</p><p>Raskin, in his letters, asserted that Patel's testimony showed that his FBI \"has failed to 'follow the money'\" regarding suspicious transactions related to Epstein that the banks had reported to the Treasury Department.</p><p>Raskin's letters focused on records known as Suspicious Activity Reports, SARs, which banks are required to file when they notice certain unusual financial activities that may be connected to illegal conduct.</p><p>The lawmaker accused each of the four banks of either ignoring or failing to adequately report red flags about Epstein's financial transfers.</p></div><div><h2>Read more CNBC politics coverage</h2><div><ul><li><a target=\"_blank\"

    "body": "<div><div><p>French President Emmanuel Macron attends a press conference after a European Union leaders' special summit to discuss Ukraine and European defense, in Brussels, Belgium March 6, 2025. </p><p>Christian Hartmann | Reuters</p></div><div><p>Market attention turns to France again Thursday after President Emmanuel Macron's office said last night that he will name a new prime minister in the next 48 hours.</p><p>Macron thanked outgoing Prime Minister Sebastien Lecornu for his efforts in holding last-ditch talks with various parties over whether there could be a way out of France's ongoing political morass without holding new parliamentary elections, which would likely benefit the poll-leading far-right.</p><p>With Lecornu's departure confirmed, Macron now turns to the tricky task of picking a PM who can find a compromise with rivals over the state budget and the urgent task of reducing France's deficit and debt pile.</p><p>Macron would ideally like to see hard-won reforms, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/08/frances-crisis-takes-an-unexpected-turn-as-macrons-allies-defy-him.html\">particularly his unpopular pension reform</a>, left alone but there have been rumblings that it might need to be tweaked, or scrapped altogether, as a way to reach a compromise between a new minority government and other parties — particularly the Socialist Party, which is seen as a kingmaker — that might be willing to support a new PM, but at a high price.</p></div><div><p>The National Assembly building in Paris, France, on Monday, Oct. 6, 2025. French Prime Minister Sebastien Lecornu resigned Monday morning, just a day after President Emmanuel Macron named a new cabinet that was broadly criticized. Photographer: Nathan Laine/Bloomberg via Getty Images</p><p>Bloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty Images</p></div><div><p>As with so much in French politics over the last year, arguments are already emerging over that, with the center-right Les Republicains party saying they don't want there to be any review of the pension reform.</p><p>\"In any way, there must be a political solution at some point in time,\" Eric Chaney, economic advisor to Institut Montaigne and former chief economist at AXA, told CNBC, but he said freezing or canceling the pension reform would be costly, in more ways than one.</p><p>\"Firstly, there would be a budgetary cost of around 13 billion euros [$19.6 billion] per year if this pension reform is frozen,\" Chaney told CNBC's Charlotte Reed in Paris on Thursday.</p></div><div><p><img src=\"https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/108209795-17599920661759992063-42013051651-1080pnbcnews.jpg?v=1759992065&w=750&h=422&vtcrop=y\" alt=\"Why France's pension reform should not be scrapped, according to one economist\" /><span></span><span><div><p><span>watch now</span><span></span></p></div></span></p></div><div><p>\"The second reason is that one of the key points of the pension reform is to raise the retirement age to 64 [from 62], which is not a lot compared to other European countries, and it has allowed the participation rate of senior people in the labor market to rise ... so if you remove that you will have less production, less GDP and less tax receipts for the government,\" Chaney said.</p><p>\"But the third reason is even more important and it's the political one, because if you cannot have any pension reform then what kind of reform can you have in this country? That would be a catastrophe,\" he added.</p></div><h2><a></a>Plus ça change ... or not?</h2><div><p>Macron is being urged not to pick yet another centrist ally as prime minister given the resignation of Lecornu or the ousting of Francois Bayrou and Michel Barnier, whose governments were brought down by rival parties and no-confidence votes in the last year.</p><p>There's hope that, by picking a candidate who's not from Macron's own ill-fated and unpopular political stable, a budget might have a better chance of being agreed upon.</p><p>That's crucial for the euro zone's second-largest economy that has the third-largest debt pile after Greece and Italy. France's budget deficit was 5.8% of its gross domestic product in 2024.</p><p>Nabil Milali, portfolio manager at Edmond de Rothschild Asset Management, told CNBC on Thursday that Macron might be tempted to pick a more \"neutral\" figure or technocrat this time.</p><p>\"Probably after trying three people from the center-right he will pick a more neutral figure to lead a technical government whose sole mission will be to vote on any kind of budget before the end of the year,\" Milali said.</p></div><div><p><img src=\"https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/108209805-17599932451759993243-42013248995-1080pnbcnews.jpg?v=1759993245&w=750&h=422&vtcrop=y\" alt=\"Macron might pick a more 'neutral' figure for prime minister this time\" /><span></span><span><div><p><span>watch now</span><span></span></p></div></span></p></div><div><p>\"There are at least two difficulties in this scenario — first of all is to find this rare gem, a political figure who is sufficiently neutral for both the left and right. The second is that concessions will still have to be made to the Socialist Party, which is still the kingmaker in the current National Assembly, and the main sticking point is still the pension reform.\"</p><p>Milali warned, however, that any scrapping of the pension reform would prove costly for Macron, it being the only real structural reform of his second term in office and key part of his political legacy, and for France in terms of financial market reaction.</p></div><div><p></p><h2>Read more</h2><p></p></div><h2><a></a>No budging from the far-left, or far-right?</h2><div><p>After Lecornu resigned on Monday, Macron asked him to hold 48 hours of last-ditch talks with rival parties to see if there was a way out of the political deadlock which has gripped France for months and brought down successive minority governments.</p><p>Specifically, Lecornu was looking to see if there was a way to avoid dissolving parliament and calling new parliamentary elections.</p><p>Lecornu said on Wednesday evening that those talks had shown that a majority of lawmakers opposed dissolving parliament and that a \"platform for stability\" exists. Earlier in the day he had also said he believed it would be possible to have a 2026 budget in place by the end of the year.</p><p>Macron and his centrist bloc are anxious to avoid new elections as a ballot would likely benefit Marine Le Pen's anti-immigration National Rally party. It is currently leading <a href=\"https://www.politico.eu/europe-poll-of-polls/france/\" target=\"_blank\">voter polls</a>, seen with around 32% of the vote compared to 25% of the vote being held by left-wing alliance, the New Popular Front.</p></div><div><p>The President of Rassemblement National parliamentary group Marine Le Pen addresses the press upon her arrival at her party's headquarters in Paris, on October 6, 2025.  </p><p>Thomas Samson | Afp | Getty Images</p></div><p>Given the polls and smelling blood, both the far-left and far-right are calling for fresh elections, believing they can tempt voters to vote decisively this time after inconclusive elections last summer. Those were called by Macron in a bid to gain \"clarity\" but instead achieving anything but, becoming the source of the ongoing crisis that is still plaguing France today.</p></div>",

OpenAI's private market valuation has climbed to $500 billion, driven by the popularity of ChatGPT and the company's hyper-aggressive plans for building out data centers.</p><p>Nvidia is a significant investor in OpenAI, and last month <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/22/nvidia-openai-data-center.html\">agreed</a> to pour up to $100 billion into the AI startup's infrastructure buildouts.</p><p>While AMD is a very distant challenger, the stock has also been a Wall Street darling because of the company's promises in AI and expectations that its GPUs will be enthusiastically snapped up by customers. But until its announcement with OpenAI this week, AMD's rally has largely been built on hope.</p><p>AMD's stock soared 24% on Monday, its biggest gain since 2002. It's up 89% this year compared to Nvidia's 40% gain. </p></div><div><p><img src=\"https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/108208682-17598351911759835184-41985580265-1080pnbcnews.jpg?v=1759835190&w=750&h=422&vtcrop=y\" alt=\"Here's why Bank of America is bullish on AMD amid OpenAI deal\" /><span></span><span><div><p><span>watch now</span><span></span></p></div></span></p></div><div><p>Nvidia's control of the burgeoning market has been so vast that in September of last year, during the waning days of the Biden administration, the company was reportedly subpoenaed by the Justice Department, though it <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2024/09/04/nvidia-says-it-didnt-receive-antitrust-subpoena-from-doj.html\">denied the report</a>. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., <a href=\"https://www.warren.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/warren-throws-support-behind-department-of-justice-probe-into-ai-chipmaker-nvidia-underscores-need-for-comprehensive-investigation\" target=\"_blank\">sent a letter</a> to the DOJ's antitrust unit at the time supporting a probe.</p><p>The company's growth, she wrote, \"has been supercharged by Nvidia's use of anticompetitive tactics that have choked off competition and chilled innovation.\" Nvidia said at the time that it wins on merit.</p><p>The deal OpenAI and AMD announced on Monday could change the competitive dynamic.</p><p>The tie-up is expected to bring \"double digit billions\" in revenue to AMD starting in the second half of next year. OpenAI could also end up owning 10% of AMD if the stock hits price targets over a period of years.</p><p>AMD CEO Lisa Su described the agreement as a \"win-win\" on a call with reporters, and said it's proof that her company's chips are fast enough and priced to compete with those from Nvidia.</p><p>She described OpenAI's commitment as a \"clear signal\" that AMD's GPUs and software offer the performance and economic value \"required for the most demanding at-scale deployments.\"</p><p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said on CNBC's Squawk Box on Wednesday that the OpenAI-AMD deal was \"unique and surprising.\"</p><p>\"I'm surprised that they would give away 10% of the company before they even built it,\" Huang said.<br />\"It's clever, I guess,\" Huang said.</p><p>The pact also allows OpenAI to show that its contracts and investments with suppliers like Nvidia aren't exclusive, to avoid any potential antitrust ramifications. OpenAI CEO <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/sam-altman/\">Sam Altman</a> said on social media that any AMD chips would be \"incremental\" to its Nvidia purchases, and that the \"world needs much more compute.\"</p><p>\"None of these things are, as far as I'm aware, exclusive contracts tying up avenues to other competitors,\" said Alden Abbott, senior research fellow at Mercatus Center and a former general counsel at the Federal Trade Commission. \"I don't see any argument that in the near term that shows monopolization or cartelization of AI suppliers.\"</p><p>Representatives from Nvidia, AMD and OpenAI declined to comment. </p></div><h2><a></a>'Committed to build'</h2><div><p>When it comes to Washington, D.C., regulators aren't the only concern. Those pressures have seemingly diminished this year under the Trump administration's DOJ.</p><p>Rather, semiconductor investors are worried about potential tariffs, specifically Section 232 tariffs focused on chips. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/donald-trump/\">President Donald Trump</a> has said that the tariffs, which have yet to go into effect, will double the price of imported chips. But in August, the president introduced a big carve-out.</p><p>\"If you're building in the United States or have committed to build — without question committed to build in the United States —there will be no charge,\" Trump said at an event to announce <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/AAPL/\">Apple</a><span><span></span></span></span> investments. The Trump administration's AI Action Plan pushes for the U.S. to export \"full-stack\" AI technology abroad so it can become the global standard.</p><p>Ed Mills, Washington policy analyst at Raymond James, said it's not entirely clear what will qualify for the exemption, adding that OpenAI's investment in AMD may end up being an \"off ramp\" for the company.</p><p>Nvidia and OpenAI have already played a big role in Trump's AI ambitions, as they joined with <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/ORCL/\">Oracle</a><span><span></span></span></span> in January, when the president announced Project Stargate, a plan to invest up to $500 billion in U.S. AI infrastructure.</p></div><div><p>CEO Dr. Lisa Su, AMD executives, and industry luminaries unveil the AMD vision for Advancing Al.</p><p>Courtesy: AMD</p></div><div><p>In the AMD deal, OpenAI will be using the company's Instinct MI450 systems, which will start shipping next year. It's the first time AMD has offered a \"rack-scale\" system, not just individual chips, and will mean AMD is the only company besides Nvidia offering a full stack of AI hardware technologies.</p><p>\"By having OpenAI purchase as much as they are from AMD, now we have a a multiplayer race that seems to be kind of dominated by Nvidia,\" Mills said. \"So we're expanding the number U.S. companies that are going to be able to compete in producing that U.S. tech stack.\"</p><p>There's also the China issue.</p><p>Both Nvidia and AMD have China-specific AI products that have been barred by the U.S. government for shipment to the world's second-largest economy, which is a major center of AI research. The Trump administration reversed course over the summer, and said the companies could export chips if they paid the U.S. government 15% of the revenue, but they still need export licenses.</p><p>Trump is expected to meet with China's president, Xi Jinping, at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum later this month. Recent reports suggest China could commit to investing $1 trillion in the U.S., and Mills said high-priced AI chips could be part of the deal.</p><p>AMD has historically downplayed competition with Nvidia, instead pointing to the potential opportunity in AI. The company recently said the AI chip market could be worth $500 billion by 2028, and this week said the OpenAI deal equates to at least \"tens of billions of dollars of revenue.\"</p><p>\"I think they can get to 15% to 20% market share in a $500 billion market, whereas previously they had no chance,\" said Bloomberg's Singh.</p><p>The Trump administration may not be so concerned about antitrust matters, but Nvidia and AMD are at the early stages of a battle that's expected to play out over many years, and there's no telling who will be in the White House after Trump's second term ends.</p><p>Antitrust regulators have paid close attention to the market in the past. The last time AMD played second fiddle in chips it was Intel that was the industry behemoth.</p><p>The FTC <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1991/06/29/business/inquiry-by-ftc-into-intel.html\" target=\"_blank\">opened an inquiry</a> into Intel in 1991, looking into potential anticompetitive practices in the PC market, and AMD filed a <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1991-08-30-fi-1556-story.html\" target=\"_blank\">$2 billion antitrust suit</a> against the company that year. The FTC never brought charges, and AMD and Intel ultimately settled their case.</p><p>Now AMD is worth about twice as much as Intel. And, after a spate of dealmaking, Intel's largest shareholder is the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/02/intel-stock-us-trump-stake.html\">U.S. government</a>, followed not far behind <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/18/intel-nvidia-investment.html\">by Nvidia</a>.</p><p><strong>WATCH:</strong> <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/video/2025/10/07/openais-been-on-a-deal-spree-a-but-it-may-need-even-more-compute-capacity.html\">OpenAI's deal spree</a></p></div><div><p><img src=\"https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/108208639-17598169711759816966-41982661210-1080pnbcnews.jpg?v=1759816970&w=750&h=422&vtcrop=y\" alt=\"OpenAI's been on a deal spree – and it may still need even more compute capacity\" /><span></span><span><div><p><span>watch now</span><span></span></p></div></span></p></div></div>",

Stripping out acquisitions, divestitures and foreign exchange, Pepsi's organic revenue increased 1.3% in the quarter.</p><p>However, the Frito-Lay and Gatorade owner is still seeing softer demand for its products. Pepsi's worldwide volume for both food and drinks fell 1% during the quarter. The metric strips out pricing and foreign exchange changes.</p><p>CEO Ramon Laguarta said on the company's conference call that volume was also softer as the company shifts to smaller packaging sizing to appeal to price-conscious consumers. While that shift hurts volume, it lifts revenue.</p><p>In particular, Pepsi has struggled in its home market in recent quarters, leading the company to invest back into its brands and to explore cost-cutting measures.</p><p>\"We also expect our North America business to deliver improved growth and profitability trends as we aggressively reduce costs, accelerate innovation and further sharpen our price pack architecture initiatives,\" executives said in prepared remarks.</p><p>Pepsi Foods North America, which includes brands like Doritos, Quaker Oats and Pearl Milling, reported that its volume fell 4% in the fiscal third quarter. The company has been investing in more \"permissible\" snack offerings, like Stacy's pita chips and Quaker rice cakes. It has more snack options on the way, like Doritos Protein, which aims to cash in on a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/09/restaurants-starbucks-smoothie-king-first-watch-protein.html\">consumer shift toward protein-rich foods</a>.</p><p>Pepsi also unveiled new packaging for Lay's potato chips that highlighted its lack of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/04/22/fda-announces-food-dye-ban.html\">artificial colors</a> and flavors, and pledged to launch Doritos and Cheetos \"NKD,\" which will not use synthetic dyes or flavors. Pepsi and other brands have moved to cut out those ingredients in part due to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/12/rfk-jr-pressures-pepsico-kraft-heinz-to-remove-artificial-dyes.html\">pressure from the Trump administration.</a></p><p>Likewise, Pepsi is planning to use more olive and avocado oils in its snacks; the \"Make America Healthy Again\" movement has villainized canola oil and other seed oils, despite a lack of scientific evidence.</p><p>The company has also been trying to attract price-conscious consumers by making its multipacks and single-serving snacks cheaper.</p><p>Improving the performance of the North American food segment \"is a top priority for the business,\" executives said in prepared remarks.</p><p>Pepsi's North American beverage unit saw volume shrink 3%, although Laguarta noted \"improved momentum\" in the business. The company's namesake soda grew both volume and revenue in the quarter, while new acquisition Poppi has seen its year-to-date retail sales climb more than 50% compared with the year-ago period, executives said.</p><p>In September, Pepsi divested its ownership of Rockstar Energy in the U.S. and Canada to rival energy drink maker <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/CELH/\">Celsius</a><span><span></span></span></span>. The beverage giant owns an 11% stake in Celsius.</p><p>That same month, activist investor <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/06/elliotts-plan-for-pepsico-includes-investing-in-some-of-its-iconic-brands-shedding-others.html\">Elliott Investment Management unveiled</a> a $4 billion stake in Pepsi. In a presentation and letter sent to the company's board, Elliott pushed for a number of changes, including potentially refranchising its North American bottling network and reinvesting back into its soda brands. Laguarta said on the company's conference call that both Pepsi and Elliott share the belief that the company is undervalued.</p><p>\"We're going to have conversations in the coming weeks and months,\" Laguarta said.</p><p>The company also reiterated its full-year outlook. It still expects its core constant currency earnings per share to be roughly unchanged from the prior year and organic revenue to grow by a low single-digit percentage.</p><p>Pepsi <a href=\"https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/pepsico-announces-new-chief-financial-officer-302579563.html\" target=\"_blank\">also announced</a> on Thursday that Chief Financial Officer Jamie Caulfield plans to retire. <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/WMT/\">Walmart</a><span><span></span></span></span> U.S. CFO Steve Schmitt will succeed him, effective Nov. 10.</p></div>",

It was last seen down 13.2%, on track for its worst trading day since the automaker publicly listed on the Milan stock exchange in early 2016.</p><p>U.S.-listed shares on the New York Stock Exchange opened Thursday at $419.18, down roughly 13%. Like the Milan-listed shares, the stock was at one point on track for its worst day ever. U.S.-listed shares, with a market cap of nearly $80 billion, is now down about 1% for the year amid Thursday's decline. </p><p>Analysts at Citi said in a research note that Ferrari's guidance \"falls below our 'lower growth case' estimates from our CMD preview and reflects conservatism from management, we think.\"</p><p>They added: \"Given guidance, albeit conservative, implies limited operating leverage through the coming cycle we think there is some risk to both consensus EPS and multiples near-term.\"</p></div><div><p>A picture shows the entrance of the historic Ferrari factory in Maranello on February 18, 2025.   </p><p>Federico Scoppa | Afp | Getty Images</p></div><div><p>In a separate <a href=\"https://www.ferrari.com/en-EN/corporate/articles/ferrari-capital-markets-day-2030-strategic-plan\" target=\"_blank\">update</a>, Ferrari said it would target a 2030 sports car model line-up made up of 40% internal combustion engine (ICE) cars, 40% hybrid and 20% fully electric vehicles.</p><p>Ferrari said the revised target, which is down from a prior goal of 40% EV sales by the end of the decade, is the result of a client-centric approach, the current environment and its expected evolution.</p><p>The pivot comes as the Italian carmaker lifted the hood on the technology set to power its maiden electric vehicle. Ferrari unveiled the production-ready chassis and powertrain of the \"elettrica\" during a technology and innovation workshop, saying it would start deliveries of the model in late 2026.</p><p>The completed car is expected to be launched at a global premiere next year.</p><p>\"With the new Ferrari elettrica, we once again affirm our will to progress by uniting the discipline of technology, the creativity of design and the craft of manufacturing,\" John Elkann, executive chairman of Ferrari, said in a statement.</p></div><h2><a></a>Electric ambitions</h2><div><p>Several global carmakers have <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2024/09/10/autos-car-giants-forced-to-confront-hard-truths-over-ev-transition.html\">scaled back their EV sales targets</a> in recent months, citing factors such a lack of affordable models, a slower-than-anticipated rollout of charging points and intense competition from China.</p><p>Sweden's Volvo Cars, for instance, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2024/09/04/swedens-volvo-cars-scraps-plan-to-only-sell-electric-vehicles-by-2030.html\">abandoned</a> its heavily promoted plan to sell only EVs by 2030, saying in September last year that it needed to be \"pragmatic and flexible\" amid changing market conditions.</p><p>Ferrari, which has seen its current number of active clients grow to 90,000, an increase of 20% compared to 2022, also said it planned to launch an average of four new cars per year between 2026 and 2030.</p><p>Analysts at JPMorgan were bullish following the announcements laid out in Ferrari's 2030 Strategic Plan.</p><p>\"We have a great deal of confidence in management's ability to execute on its long-term plan given ample evidence that demand currently far outstrips supply,\" analysts at JPMorgan said Thursday in a research note.</p><p>\"We also estimate the company benefits from CEO Benedetto Vigna's leadership style, which has challenged the company to capitalise on collaboration to increase the speed at which it embraces innovation. An imminent Supercar launch may also have the potential to turbocharge profits,\" they added.</p><p>— <em>CNBC's </em><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/michael-bloom/\"><em>Michael Bloom</em></a><em> and </em><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/michael-wayland/\"><em>Michael Wayland</em></a><em> contributed to this report.</em></p></div></div>",

The company's president and chief operating officer, Patrick Dumont, owns the NBA's Dallas Mavericks and was pivotal in engineering the league's return.</p><p>\"I think it's great for Macao, because it highlights really how great an entertainment city Macao truly is,\" Dumont told CNBC in an interview. He highlighted the tens of billions of dollars invested to create a world-class destination for hospitality.</p><p>\"We've been operating here for 21 years, and we've invested $17 billion, so the amount of entertainment capacity here is really tremendous,\" Dumont said. \"For us, the NBA just highlights that.\"</p></div><div><p><img src=\"https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/108209565-251008-cn-00-con-sport-patrick-dumont-walk-talk-Thumb.png?v=1759950828&w=750&h=422&vtcrop=y\" alt=\"Las Vegas Sands president says Macao is 'on its way' to competing with Vegas for business tourism\" /><span></span><span><div><p><span>watch now</span><span></span></p></div></span></p></div><div><p>The NBA games — between the Brooklyn Nets and Phoenix Suns, on Friday and Sunday — will be played at the Venetian Arena in Macao. Fans packed the same arena last month for an immersive K-pop concert by the group Twice.</p><p>Big-name events draw the biggest spenders at the gaming tables, according to analysts at Citigroup, which last month raised its projection for 2025 gross gaming revenue in Macao to $33.3 billion. Those projections represent growth of 10% year over year, an acceleration in gaming revenue gains.</p><p>For comparison, the state of Nevada booked a record $15.6 billion in gaming revenue in 2024, according to the <a href=\"https://www.americangaming.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Nevada_Overview.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">American Gaming Association</a>, citing Nevada Gaming Control Board.</p><p>But the government of Macao is intent on diversifying its economy and moving beyond its reputation as the gambling capital of the world.</p><p>When the six primary concessionaires, the companies that run licensed casino resorts in Macao, applied in 2022 to have those concessions renewed, the government extracted from them a commitment to invest nearly $15 billion over 10 years, with about 90% dedicated to non-gaming amenities.</p></div><div><p>A general view of the Casino strip in Macau, Macau. </p><p>Chris Mcgrath | Getty Images News | Getty Images</p></div><div><p><span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/WYNN/\">Wynn Resorts</a><span><span></span></span></span> CEO Craig Billings said in an email to CNBC that the company's concession-related investments are \"focused on entertainment and, as we have seen in many markets including Macau, entertainment is a clear driver of visitation.  And that visitation is from both gaming customers and non-gaming customers.\"</p><p>At Wynn Palace in Cotai, customers might snap selfies in front of an incredible collection of F1 race cars, ride a gondola over a Bellagio-esque fountain show, or dine at SW Steakhouse while catching a different theatrical show every 30 minutes. Wynn's investment in food-court style dining belies the renowned cuisine represented from across China and around the world.</p><p>Gaming executives across multiple companies say the demographics of visitors have changed since borders reopened after the pandemic. Younger gamblers, high-rollers and their spouses or children are enjoying increasingly inventive and diverse amusements.</p></div><h2><a></a>New amenities</h2><div><p><span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/MGM/\">MGM</a><span><span></span></span></span> Macau's Tria spa, the result of a $7 million investment, surprises guests with a room devoted to real snowfall. And its immersive experience pool puts the guest in the middle of a virtual ocean as a violent thunderstorm approaches, with massive rain shower heads overhead sending water cascading down.</p><p>MGM China President Kenneth Feng proudly showed off top-tier suites built to reward the best and most valuable players. He told CNBC his entire team is committed to offering modern uplifting design and superb service for an evolving Chinese visitor.</p><p>\"These people are young and sophisticated, and many of them come to Macao so often,\" Feng said. \"We need to refresh our offerings so they are excited to come to Macao and happy to visit our properties.\"</p><p>This week, families with children (and grandparents and \"helpers\" as the nannies are often called here) skipped through Melco's Studio City, climbing atop Toy Story characters, racing toward the indoor/outdoor waterpark, and boarding the only figure-8 Ferris wheel in the world.</p><p>At Melco's sister resort down the strip, City of Dreams, patrons young and old filled the theater for a destination show, \"House of Dancing Water.\"</p><p>At every resort, the restaurants, shops, pools and clubs connect with corridors outside casino floors that are carefully cloistered behind screens to block the gaming tables and slot machines from view.</p></div><h2><a></a>Getting back to gambling revenue</h2><div><p>Visitation increased nearly 20% in the first half of 2025 to 19.2 million people, according to <a href=\"https://www.dsec.gov.mo/getAttachment/8b5e79ea-9b6d-4255-8b55-0c5fd489200c/E_TUR_FR_2025_Q2.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">official government statistics</a>. Golden Week alone, an eight-day holiday period ending October 8, was expected to bring in an estimated 1.2 million visitors.</p><p>And despite the strides in general entertainment, more visitors to Macao still means more gambling.</p><p>A JPMorgan analyst note published earlier this week said this year's Golden Week was likely to be Macao's best in five years, with the casinos projected to bring in $686 million in gaming revenue in just the first five days of the holiday.</p><p>CNBC was not allowed to photograph or record the casino floor, as its prohibited by law in Macao. The special administrative region takes great pains to avoid provoking the Chinese government, which staunchly opposes any promotion of gambling on the mainland.</p></div><div><p>Casino resorts including the Londoner, Venetian and Parisian, operated by Sands China Ltd., a unit of Las Vegas Sands Corp., along the Cotai strip in Macau, China, on Saturday, April 5, 2025. </p><p>Eduardo Leal | Bloomberg | Getty Images</p></div><div><p>But it is gambling that fuels the profits and the tax revenue. Macao's government collected $5.6 billion in gaming taxes in the first half of 2025, about 1% growth over 2024. The <a href=\"https://www.dsec.gov.mo/getAttachment/5f09bdbb-a5d3-4f05-9bf5-bafe45983d2b/E_TUR_FR_2025_Q2.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">data</a> from the first half of 2025 shows non-gaming spending per capita dropped by nearly 13%.</p><p>Las Vegas, too, has invested billions of dollars in entertainment, fine dining, spas, shopping and sports. Roughly two-thirds of revenue now comes from non-gaming sources, according to the Nevada Gaming Control Board.</p><p>Of course, that's revenue; not profits. All those arenas, spas, pools and fancy theaters come with major construction and maintenance costs. And it takes a lot of high-priced concert tickets to pay off the investment.</p><p>Alan Woinski, publisher of The Gaming Industry Daily Report, blamed the slump in Las Vegas on declining tourist demand.</p><p>\"It is pretty easy to understand that leisure is where the LV Strip is seeing business plummet. Could we get back the billions wasted on non-gaming amenities to attract the non-gambling leisure customer?\" Woinski wrote on Wednesday.</p><p>Woinski says Macao is a different story: Here, the special events are driving the gambling.</p><p>\"This month will be a good test because usually after a Golden Week, the rest of the month is weak,\" Woinski told CNBC.</p><p>He said key metrics to watch are gross gaming revenue and whether the packed special events calendar for the rest of October helps deliver gaming revenue that finally returns to pre-pandemic levels.</p><p><em>— CNBC's Jessica Golden contributed to this report.</em></p></div></div>",

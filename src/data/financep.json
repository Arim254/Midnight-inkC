Elizabeth Frantz | ReutersU.S. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said she was suspending the diversity visa program, saying the man suspected of killing two students at Brown University had been granted one.Noem posted to X late Thursday that she had instructed the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services to pause the (DV1) program \"to ensure no more Americans are harmed by this disastrous program.\"On Dec. 13, two students died and nine others were injured when someone opened fire at the physics building at Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island. Police later identified Portuguese national Claudio Manuel Neves Valente, 48, as the suspect.Valente was a former student at the university and had been enrolled in a Ph.D program in physics in 2000, the university's president, Christina H. Paxson, said. Valente is also suspected of having killed MIT physics professor Nuno Loureiro in his home in Brookline, Massachusetts, two days after the Brown shooting. Valente was found dead in a New Hampshire storage facility on Thursday, Providence Chief of Police Oscar Perez said.\"There's no longer a threat to the public,\" the U.S. Attorney's Office in Boston said in a statement after Valente's death was confirmed.Noem said that Valente entered the U.S. through the DV1 program in 2017 and was granted a green card. \"In 2017, President Trump fought to end this program, following the devastating NYC truck ramming by an ISIS terrorist, who entered under the DV1 program, and murdered eight people,\" she wrote on X.The Diversity Immigrant Visa Program (DV Program) allocates up to 50,000 immigrant visas every year, according to the USCIS website.The program is a lottery. Visas are randomly allocated to individuals from countries with low rates of immigration to the U.S.",

    "body": "Christopher Waller, governor of the US Federal Reserve, speaks during the C. Peter McColough Series on International Economics at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York, US, on Thursday, Oct. 16, 2025. Michael Nagle | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesFederal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller had a \"strong interview\" for the central bank chair position with President Donald Trump in which the two discussed the labor market in depth and how to jumpstart job creation, according to senior administration officials.The interview took place in the president's residence and concluded shortly before Trump addressed the nation on the economy Wednesday night. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, chief of staff Susie Wiles and deputy chief of staff Dan Scavino also attended the interview.Blackrock's Rick Rieder will be interviewed at Mar-a-Lago for the Fed chair job the last week of the year, the officials said. Fed Governor Michelle Bowman is no longer a candidate for the job, they also said.National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett, the favorite for the job in prediction markets, and former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh have previously been interviewed by Trump.The officials said the conversation about jobs with Waller showed concern and criticism was misplaced that the president was seeking a candidate based on the criteria that the next Fed chair would bow to the whims of the president on rates. They said the president's interest in the interviews with candidates had been broad-based across a series of economic issues.Last week, Trump told The Wall Street Journal he thought the Fed Chair should consult with him on rates. \"It doesn't mean—I don't think he should do exactly what we say,\" the President said. \"But certainly we're—I'm a smart voice and should be listened to.\"In the oval office on Thursday, Trump praised Waller in response to a reporter's question. \"I think he's great. I mean, he's been a man who has been there a long time, somebody that I was very involved with.\" Trump interviewed Waller in 2019 and nominated him to be a Fed governor.Despite the praise of Waller and the positive description of the interview, there was no indication that he was a favorite candidate for the job. It was only clear that the process of interviews continues with the obvious implication that the president had yet to make a decision. The officials said the interviews are following a \"highly organized process.\"In his speech Wednesday, Trump said, \"I will soon announce our next chairman of the Federal Reserve, someone who believes in lower interest rates by a lot, and mortgage payments will be coming down even further.\"Waller's weightliftingIn an interview on Wednesday with CNBC at the Yale CEO Summit in New York, which took place before he met with the president, Waller said he believed rates could decline by 50 to 100 basis points below the current level because he expects inflation to decline and was concerned about the weak job market.Waller dissented in July when the Fed kept rates on hold, a move that seemed prescient with the Fed cutting rates by 75 basis points beginning at the next meeting in September.No details were provided of what the two men discussed about jobs, but the conversation suggests Trump could be more focused on the issue. The recent November jobs report showed a rise in the unemployment rate to 4.6% from 4.4% in September while payroll growth slowed to a crawl.In his speech Wednesday, Trump said that \"there are more people working today than at any time in American history. And 100 percent of all jobs created since I took office have been in the private sector.\"Since January, the private sector has added 687,000 jobs and the government has lost 188,000 as part of sweeping job cuts by the administration.On a lighter note, the president was said to have been seriously impressed when informed that Waller could dead lift 350 pounds.",

Customers who purchase a Basic Economy ticket on December 17, 2025 and beyond will not earn AAdvantage miles or Loyalty Points towards AAdvantage status,\" it said. \"Basic Economy customers will continue to receive one free personal item and one free carry-on bag, free snacks, soft drinks and in-flight entertainment.\"Elite loyalty members will still be eligible for first-class upgrades on domestic flights if they're on basic economy tickets, an American spokeswoman told CNBC.Basic economy tickets are airlines' cheapest but most restrictive fares, rolled out across the industry over the past decade. Generally, they do not allow customers to change their tickets without fees or pick their seats in advance.The move comes as airlines across the board have been chasing customers who are willing to spend more to fly.

    "description": "President Donald Trump's social media company will provide the capital needed to bring TAE Technologies' first fusion power plant online in the United",
    "body": "President Donald Trump's social media company will provide the capital needed to bring TAE Technologies' first fusion power plant online in the United States by 2031, TAE CEO Michl Binderbauer told CNBC on Thursday.Binderbauer spoke shortly after his privately held company and Trump Media and Technology Group announced plans for an all-stock merger valued at more than $6 billion.The CEO said the deal would combine Trump Media's \"fortress balance sheet\" with TAE's technologies.\"We've got capability and technology to really scale this,\" Binderbauer told CNBC.\"We've got the engineering prowess to do that, but the last piece of the puzzle was the capital,\" he said. \"Now, you're marrying capital with that underlying base of technical capability.\"Fusion is a form of nuclear power that could one day generate enormous amounts of energy by fusing atoms. The process, which powers the Sun, does not produce the long-life radioactive waste that is the byproduct of fission, the process created in traditional nuclear reactors. Despite decades of research, scientists and companies have so far been unable to commercialize fusion technology. Fusion ignition was only achieved for the first time in a laboratory setting in December 2022. But Binderbauer said he is bullish on his company's prospects to reliably generate — and sell — fusion power, now that it can tap funding from Trump Media.Trump Media, which operates the Truth Social app, will invest up to $200 million in TAE with another $100 million coming after filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Binderbauer said. Trump Media has meager revenue relative to its market capitalization, which was above $4 billion on Thursday, and to its balance sheet. For the third quarter that ended on Sept. 30, Trump Media had financial assets of $3.1 billion, which included cash and digital assets, the company announced last month. Trump Media for that quarter reported a net loss of $54.8 million, with sales of just under $973,000.TAE and Trump Media said that their merged company in 2026 plans, subject to regulatory approval, to \"site and begin construction on the world's first utility-scale fusion power plant,\" which would generate 50 megawatts of electrical power, an industry measurement. TAE has plans to scale up future fusion power plants to generate between 350 to 500 megawatts of power, Binderbauer said. A traditional fission nuclear power plant can generate about two to three times that much power, depending on the reactor. \"Fusion power will be the most dramatic energy breakthrough since the onset of commercial nuclear energy in the 1950s,\" Trump Media CEO Devin Nunes said on a call Thursday. \"An innovation that will lower energy prices, boost supply, ensure America's AI supremacy and revive America's manufacturing base and bolster national defense,\" Nunes said.Trump Media's investment comes as the artificial intelligence boom has left utilities scrambling to find enough power to fuel the build-out of data centers across the country. In October, the Energy Department launched a national strategy in October to accelerate the commercialization of fusion. Nunes said, \"Together with TAE, we will have the capital and public market access to scale TAE's vision to put abundant nuclear energy on the grid.\"Nunes, who is a former House member from California, and Binderbauer plan to serve as co-CEOs of the merged company.\"Nunes will continue to lead all Trump Media brand operations. Binderbauer will manage TAE Technologies,\" a news release said.TAE, whose board members include Ernest Moniz, who served as Energy secretary in the Obama administration, was founded in 1998.Since then, the company has raised more than $1.3 billion in private capital in a dozen rounds of funding, from investors such as Chevron and Alphabet's Google. Asked why TAE did not strike a deal with one of its prior investors, Binderbauer said Trump Media moved quickly and boldly.\"We have these partnerships, but this is the one that moved,\" Binderbauer said.\"I just have to reduce it to that simple sort of factor. That's really the difference,\" he said. \"We're going to build a power plant. We're going to take this technology to the commercial level.\" TAE has not yet made siting decisions or reached offtake agreements for its planned plants, Binderbauer said. \"We're in the process on that,\" he said.  \"We're going to announce that when we're ready with that, but we have a game plan.\" Michael Schwab will serve as chairman of the combined company's nine-member board. Donald Trump Jr., Nunes and Binderbauer will serve as directors. The five other members are yet to be chosen. ",

These seven provisions reduced individual income taxes by $144 billion in 2025, according to Tax Foundation estimates. However, the IRS did not adjust withholding tables, which tell employers how much to take from worker paychecks.\"Instead of gradually receiving the benefit of the tax cuts through higher take-home pay during the year, most taxpayers will receive it all at once when they file their returns,\" York wrote.watch nowWho could see a bigger refundYour 2026 tax refund could depend on which provisions affect your individual situation, experts say. The higher standard deduction, bigger child tax credit and senior tax break will have an impact on many taxpayers, whereas other provisions, such as deductions on tip and overtime income, affect smaller groups of filers.For many, Trump's legislation was an extension of the tax breaks enacted in 2017, Alex Muresianu, a senior policy analyst at the Tax Foundation, previously told CNBC. \"The basic structure of it is going to be very much the same tax code that you've been used to for the past eight years,\" he said.A note released by Piper Sandler on Oct. 31 also predicted \"an exceptionally large refund season,\" with middle- and upper-income taxpayers likely to benefit the most.   As of Oct. 17, the average refund for individual returns was $3,052 during the 2025 filing season, up slightly from $3,004 in 2024, according to the latest IRS data.  ",

Jonathan Ernst | ReutersDrug pricing has emerged as one of the biggest issues for pharmaceutical companies this year, as the U.S. looks to dramatically reduce the costs paid by consumers.As the largest single market for most pharma and biotech firms, higher drug prices in the U.S. — often nearly three times as costly as in other countries — are a key factor in the industry's reliance on American sales, with branded drugs commanding even steeper premiums.President Donald Trump has pushed for lower drug prices for Americans through so-called Most Favored Nations drug pricing, whereby the prices in the U.S. are set at the lowest price paid by other wealthy countries. That could have a tremendous impact on companies' balance sheets.But exactly how exposed are Europe's biggest pharma companies to the U.S. market?Majority U.S. salesAmong the 10 largest biopharmaceutical companies in the Stoxx 600 health index, five have a majority of their total sales from the U.S.: Roche, Novo Nordisk, GSK, Argenx, and UCB.Argenx is the most exposed, with 85% of total sales originating in the U.S. in its last reported period.The least exposed are Germany's Merck KGaA and Bayer, with about 30% of sales coming from the U.S. Both Merck and Bayer have diversified businesses that go beyond pharmaceuticals while Roche also has a sizeable diagnostics division. Meanwhile, AstraZeneca, the FTSE 100's largest company, generates 42% of its sales from the U.S., and is aiming to boost this share as it targets $80 billion in revenue by 2030. In its third-quarter earnings report, the company, which has a broad portfolio of blockbuster drugs comprising cancer, respiratory, and diabetes medicines, said it is delivering on its strategy to strengthen operations in the U.S. to \"power growth.\"The Cambridge, U.K.-based company has also pledged significant investments in the U.S., just like peers Novartis, Roche, and GSK, since Trump took up his second presidential term.Making deals​Trump's push for slashing drug prices has led many firms on both sides of the Atlantic to make deals with the administration.​In May this year, the president signed an executive order establishing MFN drug pricing. He has also sent letters to 17 major drugmakers, calling for them to slash U.S. prescription prices to levels paid overseas.​At the same time, Trump has made a push for onshoring production of various goods, including pharmaceuticals, and threatened triple-digit tariffs for drugmakers that fail to invest in U.S. manufacturing — further ramping up the pressure on companies to make deals with his administration.​AstraZeneca, Novo Nordisk, and other U.S. pharma giants have already made deals with Trump to lower prices of their medicines in the country, although analysts say it may not have a significant impact on their bottom lines due to the way the deals were structured. \"[AstraZeneca's] MFN deal is more benign than appreciated, but EU countries may see access to drugs reduced,\" said Jefferies analysts in November. ​Late Wednesday, Bloomberg reported that heavyweights Roche and Novartis – the two biggest European pharma companies by market value – were closing in on drug pricing deals with the Trump administration, which may be announced as soon as Friday. Both companies told CNBC they supported the administration's goal of lowering drug costs for Americans but declined to confirm an imminent deal. Novartis said it was \"in discussion with the Administration.\"– Carolin Roth contributed to this report",

    "body": "Russian President Vladimir Putin shakes hands with Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban during a meeting in Moscow, Russia, November 28, 2025.Alexander Nemenov | Via ReutersOne of Russia's last remaining allies in the European Union told CNBC he believes there is no way forward for proposals to fund the rebuilding of Ukraine via frozen Russian assets. The European Commission – the EU's executive arm – is considering using seized Russian assets held in Europe to provide further financial support to Ukraine. Speaking to CNBC as officials arrived at a European Council meeting, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán said proposals to use the immobilized assets as a means to assist Ukraine had been \"killed.\"\"It's [a] dead end. It's over,\" he said. \"There is no sufficient level of support behind it.\"Orbán is widely seen as Russia's closest ally within the EU, and has been a vocal critic of plans to use potentially hundreds of billions of euros of frozen assets to fund reparations loans for Kyiv. Hungary isn't alone in having doubts over the measures, however. Belgium, whose support is critical given that huge amounts of frozen assets lie in the Brussels-based clearing house Euroclear, has expressed concern over possible legal and financial risks. Italy and Bulgaria have also supported Belgium's resistance to the proposals. watch nowFor its part, the Kremlin has said such a move would be tantamount to justification for war, and Russia's central bank announced last week it was suing Euroclear in a Moscow court \"for recovery of losses caused to the Bank of Russia.\"The European Council meeting, due to conclude Friday, will have funding options for reparations loans to Ukraine high on the agenda. \"Without new additional financial support from the EU and other international donors, Ukraine is expected to run out of funds early in 2026,\" the European Parliament said in a briefing Wednesday, adding that Hungary had already blocked the option to use the headroom in the EU budget to provide funding to Kyiv. Decisions on use of the EU's own finances require a unanimous vote from all 27 member states to be passed. \"If both options proposed by the Commission are blocked, a 'coalition of the willing' could be the option of last resort,\" the European Parliament said Wednesday.Asked ahead of Thursday's meetings if he was acting in Europe's or Russia's interests by working to block the use of Russian assets by the EU, Orbán said he was \"just working for peace.\"\"I think what we have to do [is] to make some steps to peace, not to war,\" he said. watch nowRussian and Ukrainian forces are entering their fourth winter of fighting as peace talks drag on. Negotiations are expected to continue into this coming weekend, possibly in Miami, following weeks of talks between delegations from the U.S., Russia, Ukraine and Europe.  Despite Orbán's take on the subject, Kaja Kallas, EU high representative for foreign affairs and security policy, told reporters in Brussels on Thursday that the bloc was pushing for peace alongside Ukraine, but that it was \"one sided.\"\"We haven't seen any willingness from the Russian side to move or seriously talk about peace,\" she said. \"We need to put pressure on Russia, so that they go from pretending to negotiate to actually coming to the table to negotiate.\"Unlike Orbán, she struck an optimistic tone on pushing the proposals around the reparations loan and frozen assets through. \"The proposals we are working on are addressing Belgium's concerns,\" she said. \"The issues that Belgium has raised have been addressed, so I hope we get this over the finishing line. [Russian President Vladimir] Putin is banking on us to fail, so we shouldn't give him that.\"A spokesperson for the Kremlin did not respond to CNBC's request for comment.

    "body": "The House of Representatives on Thursday passed a bill aimed at making it easier to get federal permits to build infrastructure for artificial intelligence projects.The bill, known as the SPEED Act, is backed Big Tech giants such as OpenAI, Micron and Microsoft The bill cleared the House in a 221-196 vote, overcoming a conservative rebellion that nearly sank the legislation in a procedural vote earlier this week. The bill now heads to the Senate, where it is likely to be part of a larger conversation around permitting reform. The SPEED Act's proponents argue it is critical to help the U.S. outpace China and other global competitors in the race for AI dominance. \"The electricity we will need to power AI computing for civilian and military use is a national imperative,\" said Rep. Bruce Westerman, R-Ark., the bill's sponsor and chair of the House Natural Resources Committee. The SPEED Act would reform the 1969 National Environmental Policy Act, which mandates federal reviews for projects that would impact the environment.It would tighten the timelines for NEPA reviews and shrink the statute of limitations for NEPA litigation to 150 days from the current six years. Permitting reform has drawn bipartisan support recently as clean energy projects supported by Democrats became ensnared in permitting delays.Pressure has built on Congress to act as AI has emerged as a key sector and power-hungry data centers have placed an increased strain on the electric grid. The Democratic cosponsor of the bill, Rep. Jared Golden of Maine, said the SPEED Act would allow the U.S. to be \"nimble enough to build what we need, when we need it.\" Most Democrats opposed the SPEED Act, however, demanding that any permitting bill overturn President Donald Trump's moves to choke renewable energy sources like offshore wind. Democratic resistance was only compounded after GOP leadership inserted language to exempt Trump's efforts to block renewables from provisions in the SPEED Act that would limit the White House's ability to arbitrarily yank permits it does not like.The amendment was added after a standoff on the House floor during a procedural vote, where conservatives opposed to renewable energy demanded concessions for their votes.\"That provision codifies a broken permitting status quo,\" said Rep. Scott Peters, D-Calif., who supports permitting reform but opposed the SPEED Act.\"I look forward to working with my colleagues across the aisle in the Senate to craft a bipartisan product that can become law.\"",

Last week, Lululemon announced CEO Calvin McDonald would step down effective Jan. 31, following a year-long performance slump for Lululemon. Elliott has been working with former Ralph Lauren CFO and COO Jane Nielsen as a potential candidate, according to the person, who spoke on the condition of anonymity about confidential matters.In a news release announcing McDonald's departure, the company said its board of directors was working with a \"leading executive search firm\" to find its next CEO. The leadership change came as Lululemon's founder Chip Wilson has been calling on the company to make a change, saying earlier this year that the company's performance is \"in a nosedive.\"The athletic apparel company has been facing an increasingly crowded landscape, with athleisure entrants like Vuori and Alo Yoga. Nielsen served at Ralph Lauren from 2016 until April. Before that, she held roles at Coach and PepsiCo. Elliott has taken a stake in a slate of other companies as well this year, including a more than $2 billion stake in Workday and a $4 billion stake in PepsiCo. The Wall Street Journal earlier reported Elliott's Lululemon stake. ",

    "body": "Demonstrators holding flags of Ukraine and the European Union on the Boulevard du Temple in Paris, France on Feb. 23, 2025.Amaury Cornu | Afp | Getty ImagesEuropean Union countries will allocate 90 billion euros ($105.5 billion) in aid to Ukraine for 2026 and 2027, EU Council President Antonio Costa said on Friday. \"We have a deal,\" Costa wrote on social media platform X, confirming the package had been approved.EU governments had been debating whether to use 210 billion euros of frozen Russian assets, most of it held in Belgium, to support a so-called reparations loan for Ukraine.\"I am grateful to all leaders of the European Union for the European Council's decision,\" Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in a post on X, adding that it was important that \"Russian assets remain immobilized and that Ukraine has received a financial security guarantee for the coming years.\"On Wednesday, Zelenskyy had urged EU leaders and partners to increase support and decide on using frozen Russian assets to help Ukraine, saying a sustained backing was vital to keep the country resilient and to deter Russia from pressing on with the war next year.Belgium's Prime Minister Bart De Wever had said his country needed concrete guarantees before supporting the use of Russian assets to fund the loan to Kyiv, citing legal uncertainties and potential litigation risks, Reuters reported.EU leaders ultimately opted not to tap Russian assets to finance Ukraine's support package. Instead, the bloc agreed to raise money through joint borrowing backed by the EU budget. \"Ukraine will only repay this loan once Russia pays reparations,\" Costa said in a statement. \"The only way forward is a ceasefire and a negotiated peace. Our political and financial support to Ukraine will not falter.\"Under the Ukraine Facility and related programs, the EU has already delivered several tranches of financial assistance, including around 6 billion euros in bridge-financing, or short-term loans or advances provided to help Kyiv cover urgent budget needs. Ukraine has also received 18.1 billion euros in loans under a Group of Seven, or G7, led scheme this year. The agreement provides a  financial backstop for Ukraine, while underscoring Europe's push to shape U.S.-led peace negotiations to end Russia's conflict with Kyiv.Since the start of Russia's war against Ukraine in 2022, the European Union support to Kyiv has reportedly exceeded 187 billion euros.In late November, U.S. and Ukrainian officials met in Geneva to work on a refined peace framework aimed at narrowing disagreements over a U.S.-proposed plan to end the conflict. That plan, Reuters reported, included provisions on territory and security that reflected some Russian positions, including freezing current front-line control and recognizing changes to control over occupied areas, as well as measures affecting Ukraine's military and NATO aspirations, which Kyiv found difficult to accept.",

    "body": "Signage at an ICICI Prudential Asset Management Co. branch in Delhi, India, on Thursday, Dec. 18, 2025. ICICI Prudential AMC's initial public offering to raise as much as 106 billion rupees ($1.2 billion) received bids for more than 1.37 billion shares, compared with 35.02 million offered, at close on last day of the sale Tuesday, according to exchange data. Photographer: Anindito Mukherjee/Bloomberg via Getty ImagesBloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesShares of ICICI Prudential, one of India's largest asset management companies, rose 19% in their trading debut on Friday, following a 106 billion rupees ($1.17 billion) initial public offering.The IPO by the firm, jointly owned by India's ICICI Bank and UK's Prudential, was priced at 2,165 rupees per share at the upper end of the price band. Shares, which were listed on the National Stock Exchange as well as the BSE, closed at 2,576.20 rupees.The issue was subscribed more than 39 times during the bidding process, driven primarily by a strong demand from institutional investors. Retail portion of the IPO was subscribed just 2.5 times.Singapore's GIC and Temasek and India's public sector insurance company Life Insurance Corporation were among the major institutional investors that participated in the IPO.ICICI Prudential AMC is India's largest asset management company in India in terms of assets managed under active mutual fund schemes with an mutual fund quarterly average assets of 101.47 billion rupees. The company had 15.5 million retail investors as of end of September. Citigroup Global Markets India, BofA Securities India, Morgan Stanley, Axis Capital, Avendus Capital and ICICI Securities were among the joint bookrunners.Though this IPO saw relatively tepid individual investor interest, global consultancy firm Bain & Company estimates retail investor-driven assets of Indian mutual fund industry to grow to about $3.3 trillion by 2035 from 45 trillion rupees in fiscal year 2025. This comes as salaried millennials in metro cities and Gen Zs increasingly invest savings in mutual funds, even avoiding direct equities, the report said.As more retail investors participate in capital markets, the opportunities for asset managers to handle those funds are ballooning. Investment through systematic investment plans, which refer to investing bite-sized sums at regular intervals, tripled to 2.89 trillion rupees in fiscal year 2025 from 2021, data from Association of Mutual Funds in India shows.India has seen companies raise $11.4 billion via 252 IPOs during the first three quarters of this year, according to an EY report in October. With many big-ticket listings — LG Electronics, Tata Capital and Lenskart as well as ICICI Prudential AMC — coming in the final quarter, the final amount of funds raised is expected to be higher than last year's $19.9 billion.\"Due to financialization of savings Indians are increasing their exposure to mutual funds and equities. AMCs like ICICI Prudential are a carrier of this change,\" said Kranthi Bathini, equity strategist at Mumbai-based WealthMills Securities.He added that the stock is \"fairly valued, but any dips is a buy opportunity\" as ICICI Prudential AMC with its scale of operations is a good play on the long-term story of financialization of savings in India.ICICI Prudential AMC's revenue rose over 32% in fiscal year 2025 to 49.77 billion rupees, year on  year, while its net income climbed nearly 30% to 26.50 billion rupees.",

    "body": "watch nowThursday saw the release of a much lighter-than-expected consumer price report for November, breaking from the recent trend of sticky inflation.Stocks jumped. Yields fell. Odds of a Federal Reserve rate increased.And many economists scratched their heads.The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that the consumer price index had an annual inflation rate of 2.7% last month, while core CPI — a measure that excludes volatile food and energy prices — was even lower at 2.6%. Both were below what economists had been estimating, as those polled by Dow Jones called for an annual headline rate of 3.1% and a rate on core CPI of 3%. The November data release Thursday was delayed by 8 days because of the U.S. government shutdown, but more importantly, the October data was canceled, leaving it to the BLS to make certain methodological assumptions about the prior month's inflation levels.Those assumptions in the methodology were not clear to economists and were not fully explained in the release.\"The downside surprise reflects weakness in both goods and services, but may be partly due to methodological issues. The BLS might have carried forward prices in some categories, effectively assuming 0% inflation,\" Michael Gapen, chief U.S. economist at Morgan Stanley, said in a note, deeming the November reading as \"noisy\" in a way that's \"difficult to draw strong conclusions.\" \"If these technical factors are the main source of weakness, we could see reacceleration in December,\" Gapen added.The main issue: OEREconomists were zooming in on one particularly important subset in the data as problematic: owners' equivalent rent. This is a key part of calculating the inflation seen in the housing market.UBS economist Alan Detmeister said the price changes in October for the OER appear to have been \"set to zero.\"Evercore ISI's Krishna Guha, digging deeper, said it appears the BLS \"put in zero inflation in multiple categories\" while calculating the OER for the approximately one-third of cities used.\"To the extent that it introduces a downward bias, the Fed would be mindful of the risk of taking the data on housing services inflation at face value,\" he wrote in a Thursday note.Detmeister said the impact of this could linger for the next few months.\"This weakness should be reversed with very large OER and tenants' rents increases in the April CPI released in May, but until then the price levels for OER and tenants' rent will be biased downward,\" he said.Stephanie Roth of Wolfe Research estimated that the 0.13% rise in rent and 0.27% increase in OER across the two-month period comes out to a respective climb of about 0.06% and 0.13% month over month.CNBC has reached out to the BLS for comment.There were other issues as well.Roth noted that there was likely downward pressure on certain goods categories since the BLS's data collection period took place later in November, a time when there's \"more holiday discounting.\"\"The market seems to be taking the data as a dovish signal, but given the technical quirks we expect the Fed will put less weight on this reading,\" she said in a note to clients. \"While its positive inflation doesn't appear to be rising strongly on the back of tariffs, there will likely be a bounce back as the data normalizes after the shutdown-related volatility.\"To be sure, there was already some skepticism toward the report in the leadup to its release, with some on Wall Street raising concerns around bias due to impacts from the shutdown, which ended in mid-November.The enthusiasm on Wall Street that followed the release eased as the trading day continued. Stocks were off their highs, with technology stocks doing most of the heavy lifting and shares more linked to the economy, such as banks, in the red. Yields were off their lows as well.— With reporting by Steve Liesman",

    "body": "The Micron logo is seen displayed at the 8th China International Import Expo. Sheldon Cooper | Lightrocket | Getty ImagesMicron Technology's stock jumped 10% after the company signaled robust demand for its memory chips and blew away fiscal first-quarter estimates.During an earnings call with analysts, Micron, which makes memory storage used for computers and artificial intelligence servers, said rapid AI infrastructure scaling has fueled greater demand for its products.Micron said it expects the total addressable market for high-bandwidth memory to hit $100 billion by 2028, growing at a 40% compounded annual growth rate. Management also upped its capital expenditures guidance to $20 billion from $18 billion and guided to 68% gross margins as memory prices rise and the company passes on costs to customers. \"We are more than sold out,\" said business chief Sumit Sadana. \"We have a significant amount of unmet demand in our models and this is just consistent with an environment where the demand is substantially higher than supply for the foreseeable future.

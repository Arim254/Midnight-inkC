John took his apparel to music video shoots and got rappers to take photos in his gear, he's said. In 1996, he put out an ad seeking funding for his business and landed a distribution deal with Samsung, he told Business Insider in February 2018. That investment reportedly helped FUBU bring in $30 million in sales in three months.The urban streetwear brand has since brought in more than $6 billion in total revenue to date, according to John's website. John, a longtime investor judge on ABC's \"Shark Tank,\" still serves as the company's CEO.'Build slow if you have to'While launching a business or side hustle, you may be inclined to quit your job, especially if you've already brought in a bit of money — or you're just tired of your 9-to-5. Experts typically recommend a couple considerations before taking that risk.Those considerations include a strong business plan — clearly stating what the product or service is, who'll buy it and the money you'll be making — and enough money to sustain yourself as you establish your business, according to Kevin Lao, a certified financial planner and founder of advising firm Imagine Financial Security. Lao saved up a year's worth of living expenses and three months of business expenses before launching his firm, he told CNBC in January 2022. And he was clear on his company's vision, he added.\"It's very hard to be successful if you don't have a very compelling 'why,'\" Lao said.For John, his waiter job — though it wasn't glamorous — set the foundation for his approach to entrepreneurship and taught him an important lesson, he wrote.\"People don't realize it, but sometimes the day job is your first investor,\" John wrote. \"Don't get discouraged if you don't have the means to quit your job right away.

    "body": "If enacted, President Donald Trump's proposal for a temporary 10% cap on credit card interest rates could change many policies for borrowers. Among them: how issuers decide to value credit card points.  If you've accumulated any significant amount of credit card points, you should probably spend them now — but not because of the potential for a 10% interest rate cap, says Nick Ewen, senior editorial director at The Points Guy.\"This is not a reason in and of itself to spend your points,\" Ewen says. \"Even before this was announced, you should be spending your points.\"Credit card points — rewards earned from card spend that can be redeemed for benefits like travel, cash back or merchandise — are funded mainly by fees paid by merchants on each transaction, along with interest and sometimes fees paid by cardholders, Ewen says.That means a 10% interest rate cap could reduce issuer revenue. To offset that lost income, reward programs may lower the amount of points you can earn from spending on the card, increase redemption costs or offer fewer perks, Ewen says.However, putting a timeline on when points could start to lose their value if an interest rate cap is implemented is a \"fool's errand,\" because of all the uncertainty around Trump's proposal, he says. Why you should spend your credit card points nowThere are two main reasons you should be consistently spending your points, Ewen says:Credit issuers can change their policiesPoints tend to lose value over timeHotel, airline and credit card reward programs can change their redemption policies at will, and they don't necessarily need to give you advance notice of any upcoming changes, Ewen says.\"You don't know what the future is going to hold,\" Ewen says. Stockpiling points \"can really come back to bite you if something changes significantly in the program that you are holding them in.\"Changes rarely increase the value you can redeem for your points, Ewen says. Whether it's beneficial redemption rates or options to transfer your points to airlines or hotel loyalty programs, if your credit card comes with a perk you have active plans to use, Ewen says it may be wise to take advantage now.Additionally, unlike money you put in a high-yield savings or investment account, your points don't earn interest. This means their real value erodes over time as prices rise — $100 worth of points with an airline will still be worth $100 next year, even if flight prices increase, Ewen says. \"The idea of using your points now keeps money in your pocket to be used in other situations,\" Ewen says. \"Sure, you can earn more through spending and other activities, but you're not going to see a balance increase just by leaving it there.\"How many points is too many points?The number of points you should keep on hand will vary by person, and it largely depends on how many opportunities you have to redeem them, Ewen says. It can be useful to have some points saved for emergency situations like last-minute flights, he adds.For those going on multiple domestic and international trips in a year, it may make sense to hold onto more points. Those who travel less frequently should start thinking about spending their points once they hit the mid to upper five-figure range, he says.It's very common to see people saving points for a big trip like a honeymoon, Ewen says. Keep in mind that points can often be redeemed months ahead of time, and if price drops happen, especially with flights, you may be able to rebook and receive the difference back in points, though you should check with your provider first, Ewen says.If you have points that can cover a flight right now, go ahead and spend your points on it, he says: \"That is going to be your best option.\"Want to get ahead at work with AI?

    "body": "There's no way to walk through New York City's Flatiron district without seeing The Flatiron Building. It first opened in 1902 and has been part of the city's fabric ever since. And for the first time in 124 years, if you have the money, you can call it home.Formerly a commercial building, the Flatiron Building is being converted into 38 luxury condominiums, with a full completion scheduled for later this year. Apartments in the building range from three-bedroom units selling for around $10.95 million to the penthouse on the 21st floor going for over $50 million. Corcoran Sunshine is leading sales and marketing for all of the apartments, which were designed by Studio Sofield. \"Very few buildings in the world elicit an emotional response like The Flatiron Building and reimagining this iconic landmark as residential homes has been an exciting and deeply meaningful experience; one we approach with great care and respect,\" William Sofield, designer and founder of Studio Sofield, tells CNBC Make It via email. There are currently two four-bedroom, four-bathroom units available, priced from $16 million to $18.9 million. Others are set to become available later this year, with three-quarters of the building expected to be done by July. The 11th floor apartment spans 3,828 square feet and occupies two corners of the building.Courtesy of The Flatiron BuildingThe first is an 11th-floor unit that went on the market on Jan. 24 for $16 million. It spans 3,828 square feet and occupies two corners of the building, offering south, east and west exposures. The standout feature is the great room, measuring 58 feet by 21 feet, with 10-foot ceilings. \"You're in a historic building looking at historic facades. It gets tremendous light because it's southwest facing,\" James Lansill, senior managing director at Corcoran Sunshine Marketing Group, tells CNBC Make It. The second apartment is on the sixth floor and listed for $18.9 million. It spans 4,654 square feet with a great room measuring more than 63 feet by 26 feet. It also has an additional half bathroom. The unit offers views of Madison Square Park, up to Fifth Avenue and Broadway.One of the facing points of the apartment has views of Madison Square Park.Courtesy of The Flatiron BuildingLansill says the Flatiron Building apartments are special because each unit has subtle differences from its peers. \"Each one has a personality and that personality can be informed by the historical trim that surrounds the outside of the window,\" he says. \"What was modern about The Flatiron Building in 1902 is still what's modern about it today. The reimagined interiors reflect a love of craftsmanship, texture, and history. We carefully considered what kind of design would best honor the site's integrity and its place within the city,\" Sofield says. The sixth floor apartment spans 4,654 square feet with a great room measuring over 63 feet by 26 feet.Courtesy of The Flatiron BuildingThe Flatiron Building conversion began in 2023 and is a redevelopment led by the Brodsky Organization and the Sorgente Group.\"It's been a thrilling process because the building has this historical and architectural interest, but it also has this iconic shape,\" Lansill says. Landsill adds that because the building was designed for commercial use, it took the team about eight months to develop a concept that made sense. They eventually landed on two units per floor — a north and south apartment — plus two full-floor units on floors 20 and 21. Some of the amenities include a 60-foot lap pool, fitness center, billiards rooms and a piano lounge.Courtesy of The Flatiron BuildingPart of the conversation meant adding 21st-century amenities, including a wellness center, fitness center, sports simulator, lounge, 60-foot lap pool, billiards rooms and a piano lounge. The building also offers residents private storage and wine cellars for an extra fee. At the time of reporting, four apartments in the building have already sold, according to Lansill.

The crackdown on immigration enforcement by federal agents in Minnesota \"has had, and will likely continue to have, profound and even heartbreaking consequences,\" U.S. District Judge Katherine Menendez said in the ruling.Menendez did not issue a decision on whether the activity itself was lawful. Rather, she said that the plaintiffs failed to meet the standard required for an emergency order to stop activity immediately, according to the ruling.The decision comes amid widespread protests and backlash against federal immigration enforcement activity in the state, especially after fatal shootings by immigration agents in Minneapolis resulting in the deaths of U.S. citizens Renée Good and Alex Pretti.Attorney General Pam Bondi called the ruling \"HUGE.\" \"Neither sanctuary policies nor meritless litigation will stop the Trump Administration from enforcing federal law in Minnesota,\" she said in a post on X.",

    "body": "Elon Musk looks on as President Donald Trump speaks at the US-Saudi Investment Forum at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington, Nov. 19, 2025.Brendan Smialowski | Afp | Getty ImagesA cache of newly released documents from the Epstein files on Friday showed Elon Musk apparently corresponded with the convicted sex offender in 2012 and 2013, as they discussed meeting at Jeffrey Epstein's private island and at Musk's SpaceX facility in Southern California. The emails indicate Musk asked about attending the \"wildest party,\" hosted by Epstein at his island. Musk, who serves as CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, has for years downplayed his connection to Epstein, who died by suicide in 2019 while in federal custody. \"Epstein tried to get me to go to his island and I REFUSED,\" Musk said in a post on his social network X in September. He also complained that Sky News had mentioned him in conjunction with Epstein before naming Britain's Prince Andrew, who had visited the island. The U.S. Virgin Islands issued a subpoena to Musk in 2023 because of suspicion that Epstein \"may have referred or attempted to refer\" Musk as a client to JPMorgan Chase.The Department of Justice on Friday released millions of additional pages of documents related to Epstein, along with more than 2,000 videos and 180,000 images, Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said. The release comes after weeks of criticism that the DOJ wasn't complying with the requirement under federal law passed in November that all files related to Epstein be publicly released by Dec. 19.Among the documents released Friday were emails dated from 2012 to 2013, showing Musk's name but with his email address redacted.\"The world needs more romance,\" Musk wrote to Epstein in October 2012, the documents indicate. He told Epstein that he would be traveling with his partner at the time, English actress Talulah Riley, to St. Barts, and was looking to potentially connect at Epstein's Island.In a November 2013 email, Epstein offered to send Musk a private helicopter to transport him to the island and asked, \"how many people will you be for the heli to island?\" Musk responded that it would be just him and Riley and asked, \"What day/night will be the wildest party on your island?\"In a December 2013 email, Musk again wrote to Epstein saying, \"Christmas and New Year's, will be in the BVI /St Bart's area over the holidays. Is there a good time to visit?\"  \"I will send heli for you,\" Epstein responded, with Musk writing back, \"Thanks.\"In a follow-up email on Dec. 25, Musk said, \"Actually, I could fly back early on the 3rd. We will be in St Bart's.\" He asked if he and Riley should head to the island the day before. CNBC hasn't confirmed whether Musk ever visited the Island, though Musk has denied ever traveling there. Musk didn't respond to a request for comment. The emails released on Friday also show that in October 2012, Musk forwarded questions from Epstein to his cousin, Peter Rive, a SolarCity founder. Musk had invested personally in SolarCity and sat on the company's board.In the emails, Epstein asked if the solar installer could electrify his New Mexico ranch, or his private Island. Musk asked Rive, in an Oct. 4, 2012 email, \"Are we in New Mexico?\" Tesla acquired SolarCity in 2016 in a controversial deal, folding it into what would become the company's energy division. In June of last year, Musk wrote in a post on X, that he thought President Donald Trump and his administration were withholding Epstein-related files from the public view in order to protect the president's reputation.\"Time to drop the really big bomb: @realDonaldTrump is in the Epstein files,\" Musk, who was in the midst of a public spat with the president, wrote at the time. \"That is the real reason they have not been made public. Have a nice day, DJT!\"Days later he apologized for posts about Trump that he said \"went too far.\"WATCH: House votes to release more Epstein investigation files",

    "body": "Thomas Fuller | Sopa Images | Lightrocket | Getty ImagesCompany: CoStar Group Inc (CSGP)Business: CoStar Group engages in the provision of online real estate marketplaces, information, and analytics in the commercial and residential property markets. It operates through the following segments: CoStar Portfolio, Information Services Portfolio, Multifamily Portfolio, LoopNet Portfolio and Other Marketplaces Portfolio. The CoStar Portfolio segment consists of two classes of trade receivables based on geographical location: North America and International. The Information Services Portfolio segment includes four classes of trade receivables: CoStar Real Estate Manager; Hospitality, North America; Hospitality, International; and other Information Services. The Multifamily Portfolio, LoopNet Portfolio and Other Marketplaces Portfolio segments focus on one class of trade receivables. The company was founded by Andrew Florance and Michael Klein in 1987 and is headquartered in Arlington, Va.Stock Market Value: $26.07B ($61.50 per share) Ownership: 0.71%Average Cost: n/aActivist Commentary: Third Point is a multi-strategy hedge fund founded by Dan Loeb, that will selectively take activist positions. Loeb is one of the true pioneers in the field of shareholder activism and one of a handful of activists who shaped what has become modern-day shareholder activism. He invented the poison pen letter in a time when it was often necessary. As times have changed, he has transitioned from the poison pen to the power of the argument. Third Point has amicably gotten board representation at companies like Baxter and Disney, but the firm will not hesitate to launch a proxy fight if it is being ignored.What's happeningOn Jan. 27, Third Point sent a letter to the CoStar board calling on them to (i) replace a majority of the board and align management compensation to total shareholder return; (ii) consider strategic alternatives for Homes.com and related residential real estate (RRE) businesses; and (iii) refocus on the core commercial real estate (CRE) business. Third Point was previously bound by standstill restrictions following a settlement for board seats last year, which expired on Jan. 27. The firm now plans to nominate a new slate of directors.Behind the scenesCoStar Group (CSGP) is a provider of online real estate marketplaces, information, and analytics in the property market. It manages major brands including CoStar Suite, LoopNet, Apartments.com and Homes.com. Approximately 95% of the company's revenue is derived from its core commercial real estate (\"CRE\") franchises, which largely consists of CoStar Suite and Apartments.com. These businesses benefit from high barriers to entry, strong pricing power, proprietary data and subscription-based business models that drive recurring revenue and highly predictable free cash flow. Because of these dynamics, this business has historically traded at a premium to its Information Services peers but is now trading in line with them.This regression in the company's valuation largely stems from CoStar's aggressive investment into the residential real estate (\"RRE\") marketplace, Homes.com, which the company acquired in May 2021. From the beginning, CoStar's plan to build a dominant online classifieds business in the U.S. RRE industry was deeply flawed. Unlike its core CoStar Suite and Apartment.com businesses, Homes.com lacks clear competitive advantages and meaningful differentiation and faces intense competition from well-established peers like Zillow. Nevertheless, over the past five years, CoStar has invested roughly $5 billion in its RRE segment, $3 billion of which was in the U.S. Despite this massive investment, the U.S. RRE businesses generated only $60 million of revenue in 2024 and $80 million in 2025. Moreover, in addition to these direct financial losses, these initiatives have diverted focus from the core CRE business, limiting its growth potential.It was this backdrop that initially prompted Third Point to engage with CoStar last year, which ultimately resulted in a support agreement between the company, D.E. Shaw and Third Point. This agreement included (i) the addition of Christine McCarthy, John Berisford and Rachel Glaser as directors to the board; (ii) the retirement of Michael Klein, Christopher Nassetta and Laura Kaplan from the board; (iii) the appointment of Louise Sams as independent board chair; and (iv) the creation of a capital allocation committee. While these governance changes appeared to be a meaningful step in the right direction, progress has been deeply disappointing. Management has continued to move forward with its U.S. RRE initiatives, repeatedly shifting the strategy and missing targets even after they had been revised. In fact, the RRE business has gotten so bad that in 2025, the company cut Homes.com subscription pricing by over 30% and Homes.com is now expected to reduce 2025 adjusted EBITDA by more than 65%. Moreover, these losses are not going away anytime soon, as CoStar's new medium-term guidance now projects that Homes.com will not break even until 2030. Unsurprisingly, these failures continue to be reflected in the company's share performance, which has been underperforming the S&P 500 by over 45 percentage points since the date of the agreement and over 120 percentage points over the past five years.With the standstill period now expired, it's perhaps no surprise that Third Point is escalating its engagement, issuing a letter to the CoStar board calling on them to (i) replace a majority of the board and align management compensation to total shareholder return; (ii) consider strategic alternatives for Homes.com and related RRE businesses; and (iii) refocus on the core CRE business. While the latter two of these initiatives may feel intuitive given the aforementioned track record, it prompts the troubling question as to why this has not already been put into motion. The answer to that is the board's failure to hold management accountable. In fact, the company has rewarded CEO Andrew Florance. In 2024, he received approximately $37 million in total compensation, placing him in the top 10% of S&P 500 CEO earners despite the company being in the bottom 10% of performers. The board has done nothing to remedy this going forward as it has proposed tying only 25% of his future long-term incentives to total shareholder return, further disconnecting his pay from shareholder outcomes and particularly concerning for a CEO with de minimis stock ownership. This was done by the new board with three of eight directors recently appointed through the Third Point/D.E. Shaw settlement agreement, which appears to underscore the degree of control the CEO maintains over the company.While this may seem like a tall task, if Third Point succeeds, the upside potential appears significant. The firm points out that CoStar Suite alone has significant untapped pricing power, with an average selling price of just $350 per month, far below comparable information services products. Third Point also believes that the company has substantial opportunities to expand into adjacent end markets and develop new agentic products. Overall, Third Point believes that the CRE business should be capable of achieving EBITDA margins above 50% in the medium term, with further expansion over time given that peers ultimately achieve margins from 60% to 70%. In addition, the company's under-levered balance sheet also provides capacity for meaningful share repurchases, creating further opportunities for shareholder value creation. Putting it all together, absent the RRE distraction, Third Point believes that the CRE business could compound revenue at a mid-teens rate and grow earnings power per share in excess of 20% annually.This engagement is an example of shareholder activism the way it ought to be. Third Point quickly and amicably agreed to a settlement with the company to give it a chance to show Third Point that it can change its ways and start to turn around its poor performance. Had CoStar Group done that, you would not be reading this right now. But the company did the opposite, leaning into the strategy that has been failing it and its shareholders. So, now Third Point knows two things for sure: (i) change is definitely needed and (ii) three new directors is not enough to release the grip that Florance has on the board. We would expect to see Third Point nominate anywhere from three to six new directors. Two of the three directors (Christine McCarthy and John Berisford) appointed in last year's settlement were selected by Third Point, and we would expect them to not be targeted this year. So, assuming they are on the ballot as incumbents, Third Point could get a majority of the board by winning three seats. The decision whether to go for more than three will be made after consulting advisors on strategy and doing proxy math, particularly in the era of the universal ballot. There is an outside chance that the firm goes for eight if the company does not nominate McCarthy and Berisford. We would hope to see a Third Point executive nominated because in situations like this where substantial change is needed and that change has been met with resistance by a founder/CEO for so many years, it is helpful to have the activist in the room who designed the plan and is most passionate about it. While Third Point does not overtly call for it, it is hard to imagine a scenario where the firm wins meaningful board representation and Florance stays on as CEO – it does not seem like either of them would want that.Third Point, founded by Dan Loeb, is a true pioneer in shareholder activism, but has used it more sparingly in recent years as dictated by the market environment and available opportunities. He invented the poison pen letter in a time when it was often necessary. As times have changed, he has transitioned from the poison pen to the power of the argument. However, in this campaign we see shades of the old Dan Loeb – using phrases like \"feckless board of directors\" and \"CEO and his supine enablers.\" We particularly enjoyed his analogy of a CEO's compensation to elementary school children who win participation awards for finishing last. CoStar Group saw the new, more amicable Dan Loeb in April when he settled for three new directors. Now, the company may have woken up the Dan Loeb of the past, who has been in a sort of hibernation for years. We will not know for sure until March 13 when the nomination window opens.Ken Squire is the founder and president of 13D Monitor, an institutional research service on shareholder activism, and the founder and portfolio manager of the 13D Activist Fund, a mutual fund that invests in a portfolio of activist investments.",

Chevrolet Blazer electric vehicle at a dealership in Colma, California, Jan. 23, 2026.David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesDETROIT — American consumers are hitting a fork in the road when it comes to the U.S. automotive industry. Affluent buyers are purchasing new vehicles at increasingly higher prices, while lower-income ones are continuing to drive used models.This trend is a growing concern for auto executives and feeds into worries that U.S. consumers are facing a \"K-shaped\" economy, where the wealthy keep seeing gains while those who have lower incomes struggle.\"We have a different vehicle buyer today than we had just a few years ago,\" Cox Automotive senior economist Charlie Chesbrough said Thursday during an auto analyst event. \"The key takeaway here is that we're seeing the average buyer here is much more affluent.\"Cox reports that the share of new-car buyers with incomes of less than $100,000 has dropped from 50% in 2020 to 37% last year, representing millions of lost sales. On the other end of the spectrum, the share of buyers with incomes of more than $200,000 has grown from 18% to 29% during that timeframe.The shift has occurred as MSRP, or manufacturer's suggested retail price, hit an average of $51,000 in 2025, according to Cox, and as buyers are also dealing with higher insurance costs and inflation. Consumer sentiment, meanwhile, is at recessionary levels.New-car sales were at record levels of more than 17 million prior to 2020 but have experienced mixed results since, ending 2025 with 16.3 million sales. Brand-new vehicles have never been for the majority of U.S. consumers, but automakers have increasingly been pricing millions of Americans out, including by cutting entry-level vehicle lines such as small cars.\"We're now relying on the extremely wealthy to generate the sales,\" Mark Barrott, a partner at consulting firm Plante Moran, said during the Thursday event. \"That's a structural problem from an affordability perspective.\"Barrott said U.S. sales aren't hitting records but that they're still pretty good compared with historical levels. Automotive executives may begin taking more notice if the market conditions shrink due to buyers getting priced out, he added.\"It's not unrealistic to think that in the next two or three years we could get to that kind of level, and then this really starts to hurt the [automakers],\" he said.A modeling study by Plante Moran found a third of the U.S. population can't afford new vehicles, with very limited choices for those who may be on the fence. There are roughly 110 \"affordable\" models, in relative terms, for household incomes of $65,000 or less compared with more than 250 \"affordable\" models for those with incomes of up to $105,000, according to the study.The median household income in the U.S. was $83,730 in 2024, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. That has risen 24% since 2020, when it was $67,521.U.S. average transaction prices for new vehicles, meanwhile, were hovering around $50,000 toward the end of last year, up 30% from less than $38,747 to begin 2020, according to Cox Automotive.CarMax's Edmunds this month reported new-car buyers are increasingly spending more per month on the purchase of a new vehicle, with a record of 20% committing to average monthly payments of more than $1,000 during the fourth quarter of last year.Ford CEO Jim Farley earlier this month warned the U.S. automotive industry needs to be mindful of affordability concerns leading to consumer pullback. While producing larger, more expensive vehicles can be more profitable for automakers, it can shrink the market and lower sales. \"Anyone in the auto industry … we should all be very careful about consumer demand,\" Farley said Jan. 13 during an event for the Detroit Auto Show. \"That's really important.\"Read more CNBC auto newsAuto executives are hoping for the best and planning for the worst in 2026GM expects to top Ford in U.S. vehicle production as it faces up to $4 billion in tariff costsStellantis stock off 43% as Jeep maker turns five, executes turnaroundEV realism is here.

The company needs to bring more of its satellites online so it can begin offering an internet-from-space service that was recently rebranded as Amazon Leo. The company has earmarked at least $10 billion to build the network.Delays beyond Amazon's control, including a \"shortage in the near-term availability\" of rockets, necessitate an extension, the company said in a filing made public on Friday. Amazon also pointed to manufacturing disruptions, the failure and grounding of new launch vehicles and limitations on spaceport capacity. Leo is \"producing satellites considerably faster than others can launch them,\" the company wrote. The company is now seeking a 24-month extension, to July 2028, or for the FCC to waive its deadline requiring Amazon to get roughly half of its 3,236 low Earth satellites up. In 2019, Amazon unveiled its plans to build a constellation of low Earth satellites. They are designed to provide high-speed, low-latency internet to consumers, corporations and governments, offering connections through square-shaped terminals. Amazon has booked more than 100 launches to deploy dozens of satellites at a time. The company said in the filing that it has bought 10 more launches with Elon Musk's SpaceX, as well as a dozen additional rides with Blue Origin, the space exploration startup of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos.The company said that many of its partners have notched significant launch milestones with their respective rockets in the past year. \"Not withstanding this progress, the development timelines for these next-generation vehicles have extended beyond initial projections, contributing to Amazon Leo's deployment delays,\" the company wrote.Amazon has sent up more than 150 satellites since April. The company said it expects to deploy about 700 satellites by July 30, \"moving from the third- to the second-largest satellite constellation in orbit.\" Its next launch is slated for Feb. 12, when Amazon will fling another 32 satellite into space atop a rocket from Arianespace, a French company. Leo's primary rival is SpaceX's Starlink, which has more than 9,000 satellites in orbit and roughly 9 million customers. Another challenger, OneWeb, is operated by France's Eutelsat and has a constellation of more than 600 satellites.In November, Amazon opened up an \"enterprise preview\" of Leo to select users ahead of a broader commercial launch. Amazon said if the FCC were to deny it an extension, it would \"undermine\" the agency's goals of expanding spectrum access and promoting \"expeditious deployment.\" The company also noted that the agency has previously granted similar extensions.\"Amazon Leo is engaged in full-scale deployment and stands on the doorstep of offering U.S. customers a competitive and innovative new service,\" the company said. \"An extension would enable this rapid and ongoing deployment to continue, while strict enforcement would interrupt or halt this effort.\" WATCH: Amazon laying off about 16,000 corporate workers in latest anti-bureaucracy pushwatch now",

    "body": "watch nowEli Lilly CEO Dave Ricks on Friday said upcoming Medicare coverage of obesity drugs could be a major catalyst for the rollout of the company's closely watched experimental weight loss pill, orforglipron.In an exclusive interview with CNBC, Ricks said Lilly expects to have Medicare coverage for the treatment \"immediately following that launch, and that will change the game a bit too.\" He said that's because many patients are currently paying in cash for competitor Novo Nordisk's GLP-1 pill for obesity. That launched earlier this month and is off to a strong start, even with spotty insurance coverage. Ricks said he noticed that nearly all of the early adopters of Novo's Wegovy pill are new to GLP-1 treatments rather than users of existing injections, so \"it's expansive, it's reaching more patients and that's great.\" He added that Lilly is confident in its pill's ability to compete and is preparing for a \"full launch\" in the second quarter. The rollout is set to coincide with Medicare starting to cover obesity medicines for the first time later this year under drug pricing deals Lilly and Novo struck with President Donald Trump in November. Eli Lilly CEO Dave Ricks speaks during a press conference in Houston, Sept. 23, 2025.Antranik Tavitian | ReutersThat government coverage will bring the price point of pills even lower in the second half of the year, Ricks said. Certain Medicare patients will pay a copay of $50 per month for all approved uses of injectable and oral GLP-1 drugs, including diabetes and obesity treatment.\"That opens up things pretty wide, and we'll see where we can go from there,\" Ricks said. Medicare coverage of obesity treatments is a long-awaited move that some health experts say could broaden the market for the medicines and spur more private insurers to cover them. Ricks estimates that 20 million to 30 million Medicare beneficiaries who are suffering from obesity and related health conditions could be eligible for GLP-1 treatments, so coverage is a \"big multiplier on the eligible pool.\"Ricks acknowledged that under the drug pricing deal, there will be \"a step down in pricing\" early this year. The agreements involve drugmakers voluntarily offering their medications for less, including selling their existing treatments to Medicaid patients at the lowest prices abroad, and guaranteeing that so-called most-favored nation pricing for new medicines.But Ricks said volume growth of Lilly's drugs \"will ramp on the back half of the year.' \"We think that's a positive balance for us, but time will tell,\" he said, adding that it will be based on uptake of the treatments among Medicare patients and the company's share of that adoption. Lilly will share more details on the financial impact of the deal when it posts its fourth-quarter earnings and 2026 guidance next week, he said. The price agreements include commitments to launch drugs at discounted cash-pay prices on Trump's direct-to-consumer platform, TrumpRx. That site, which was expected to launch in January, is not yet live.Ricks said Lilly was the first drugmaker to sell obesity treatments directly to patients through the company's platform, LillyDirect, and TrumpRx is \"taking that and expanding it across the industry\" to other medicines.\"We're all for that,\" he said.",

    "body": "You need to have the right skills to do the job you're hoping to land. But your ability to communicate that you have them — and can use them to help your prospective employer become more successful — is just as important.\"The things that make us good at communication also make us very, very attractive in an interview,\" Charles Duhigg tells CNBC Make It. Duhigg has studied hundreds of people in authoring three books on productivity, habits and communication. His latest book, \"Supercommunicators: How to Unlock the Secret Language of Connection,\" examines what sets the most effective communicators apart.Duhigg shared three communication tips that candidates should take into their next job interviews to connect with the person on the other side of the table (or screen) and make a stronger impression.1. Give authentic answersInterviewers know candidates are eager to impress. But if your answers to interview questions sound too polished or canned, you could be doing yourself a disservice.\"They know that you're performing; they know that you're there to try and get a job,\" Duhigg says. But the more we can \"genuinely convey who we are,\" the more the employer has \"a chance to see whether we'll actually succeed there.\"Answering questions genuinely, but tactfully, can help you stand out, he adds. \"The interviewer is going to remember that answer,\" he says. \"The best communication is the most genuine communication.\"One of the toughest questions to answer in an interview is \"Tell me about your weaknesses.\"If they ask a question like this, Duhigg says, \"and I answer it as honestly as I can, it doesn't mean that I have to expose my flaws, it doesn't mean that I have to say something out of line.\"Career coach Madeline Mann previously told CNBC Make It that an ideal answer would briefly explain a genuine weakness, but not one that's \"core to the job,\" before laying out steps you're taking to address the problem area.2. Ask questions\"Think about how many people go into an interview and the person asks them, 'Do you have any questions for me?' and the question they ask is completely predictable,\" Duhigg says.The best communicators typically \"ask a lot more questions\" than their peers, Duhigg says. They also ask what he calls deep questions, or those that center on a person's values, beliefs or experience.For job candidates, that might mean asking an interviewer how they got into that line of work, or what their favorite part of working there is.3. Mirror their body languageSome of the most important communication is silent. Body language can be very telling, and mirroring things like your interviewer's posture, gestures and expressions can make you a more attractive candidate for the job.That could be as simple as smiling back when they smile during conversation or noticing when they lean in and doing the same.\"The more we are prepared and comfortable doing that, the better off that interview is going to go,\" Duhigg says.Want to get ahead at work with AI?

    "body": "Kraft Heinz announced plans to split into two separately traded companies, reversing its 2015 megamerger, which was orchestrated by billionaire investor Warren Buffett. Justin Sullivan | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesBig Food is slimming down. As both consumers and regulators push back against ultra-processed foods, the companies that make them have been splitting up or divesting iconic brands. Last year, Unilever spun off its ice cream business into The Magnum Ice Cream Company. Kraft Heinz is preparing to break up later this year, undoing much of the merger forged more than a decade ago by Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway and private equity firm 3G Capital. And Keurig Dr Pepper is planning a similar split after it finishes its acquisition of JDE Peet's. In 2024, nearly half of mergers and acquisitions activity in the consumer products industry came from divestitures, according to consulting firm Bain. Over the next three years, 42% of M&A executives in the consumer products industry are preparing an asset for sale, a Bain survey found.Of course, the trend isn't confined to just the consumer packaged goods industry. Industrial companies like GE and Honeywell have pursued their own breakups in recent years. It's happening too in legacy media; Comcast spun off many of its cable assets into CNBC owner Versant, while Warner Bros. Discovery is planning to spin off its cable networks later this year as Netflix acquires its streaming and studios division.\"In many of the spaces that we're seeing this type of activity, there are many very fierce competitive pressures that are making it harder to operate,\" said Emilie Feldman, a professor at The Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania.The squeeze on packaged food and beverage companies comes from lower demand, which has led to shrinking volume for many of their products. To turn around their businesses and win back investors, they are counting on dumping underperforming brands. February will bring both quarterly earnings reports and presentations at the annual CAGNY Conference, offering investors more opportunities to hear about food executives' plans for their portfolios. Companies to watch include Kraft Heinz, which could share more details on its upcoming split, and Nestle, which is considering selling off multiple brands in its portfolio.Cases of Dr. Pepper are displayed at a Costco Wholesale store on April 27, 2025 in San Diego, California.Kevin Carter | Getty ImagesShrinking salesFor more than a decade, consumers have been buying fewer groceries from the inner aisles of the grocery store, instead focusing on the outer aisles with fresh produce and protein. The pandemic served as the exception, as many consumers returned to the brands that they knew. However, price hikes and \"shrinkflation\" as life eased back to normal largely erased that shift in behavior.More recently, regulators, emboldened by the \"Make America Healthy Again\" agenda espoused by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., have put both more pressure and a bigger spotlight on processed foods. And the rise of GLP-1 drugs to combat diabetes and obesity have meant some of food companies' key consumers have lost their appetite for the sweet and salty snacks that they used to eat.As a percentage of overall spending, the consumer packaged goods industry has held onto its market share. But the biggest companies are losing customers to upstart brands or private-label products, according to Bain partner Peter Horsley.On average, about 35% of large consumer products companies' portfolios are in categories with more than 7% growth, Horsley said. For comparison, over half of private-label brands are in high-growth categories, like yogurt and functional beverages, and for insurgent brands, it's even higher. For Big Food, the result has been slowing — or even declining — sales, followed by stock declines. In some cases, activist investors push for companies to focus more on their core offerings and to offload so-called distractions. \"You're seeing a lot of pressure from a valuation standpoint, especially for these publicly traded companies,\" said Raj Konanahalli, partner and managing director of AlixPartners. \"One way to reset expectations is to really kind of focus more on the core offerings and dispose or divest the slower, capital-intensive or non-core businesses.\"While getting bigger helped food companies develop scale, enter new markets and grow their sales, it also made their businesses much more complex, according to Konanahalli. Become too big, and it becomes too difficult to make decisions quickly or to decide how and where to invest back into the business.To be sure, some of these divestitures and breakups follow deals that seem to have been ill-advised from the start. Look no further than the merger of Keurig Green Mountain and Dr Pepper Snapple Group in 2018, to form Keurig Dr Pepper. \"Frankly the surprise to us was the decision back in 2018 when Keurig Green Mountain acquired the Dr Pepper Snapple Group in an $18.7 billion deal to create Keurig Dr Pepper in the first place,\" Barclays analysts Patrick Folan and Lauren Lieberman wrote in a note to clients in August when the breakup was announced. \"At the time, it was seen as both odd and a very left field deal with the questionable logic of combining coffee and [carbonated soft drinks].\"(When the merger was announced in 2018, Lieberman said on a conference call with executives from both companies that she was still \"scratching my head\" about the logic of the deal for both players).Shares of Keurig Dr Pepper have risen 37% since the merger. The S&P 500 has climbed 150% over the same period.To sell or not to sellLike many industries, the packaged food industry has gone through cycles of expansion and contraction, according to Feldman. For example, Kraft spun off a snacking business that includes Oreos into Mondelez in 2012, just three years before it merged with Heinz.However, in recent years, expanding through acquisitions has required more sophisticated thinking and execution.\"If you go back to those glory years of pre-2015, the rules of the game in consumer products felt fairly simple, at least if you're a global company,\" Bain's Horsley said. \"You bought another company that was relatively similar to you. You integrated it together, you pulled out the cost synergies ... and then that gave you good top-line and bottom-line growth. But the rules of the game have changed.\"Around 2015, upstarts like Chobani or BodyArmor began stealing market share from legacy brands. As a result, food giants needed to become more thoughtful about what they were acquiring and how they were managing their portfolios, according to Horsley. For a cautionary tale, look no further than Kraft Heinz, formed by a mega-merger in 2015. Investors initially cheered the deal, but their enthusiasm waned as the combined company's U.S. sales began lagging. Then came write-downs of many of its iconic brands, like Kraft, Oscar Mayer, Maxwell House and Velveeta, in addition to a subpoena from the Securities and Exchange Commission related to its accounting policies and internal controls.With the benefit of hindsight, analysts and investors have blamed much of Kraft Heinz's downward spiral on the brutal cost-cutting strategy imposed after the merger. The company's leadership was too focused on slashing costs and not enough on investing back into its brands, particularly at a time when consumer tastes were changing.Since Kraft Heinz began trading as one company, shares have tumbled 73%. But not everyone is sold that getting rid of underperforming brands will benefit shareholders.\"If you don't fix the underlying capability, it doesn't matter how many brands you sell or don't sell,\" RBC Capital Markets analyst Nik Modi said. \"They're not addressing the root problem. It's just something to make investors happy because it seems like they're making a change.\"One breakup that Modi agrees with is that of Kellogg, which split into the snacks-focused Kellanova and cereal-centric WK Kellogg in 2023. Last year, chocolatier Ferrero snapped up WK Kellogg for $3.1 billion, while Mars closed its $36 billion acquisition of Kellanova.From Modi's perspective, the breakup created more value for shareholders than the combined business did. Kellogg's high-growth snack business was much more viable as an acquisition target without the sluggish cereal division attached. Plus, the two strategic buyers are both privately held companies that don't have to worry about sharing quarterly earnings with the public.Some investors are hoping for the same outcome with Kraft Heinz.\"The view that many have had is the best way to create value is split the companies and hope that you can create a Kellanova 2.0 where both entities get acquired at some point down the line, and that's where value creation happens,\" said Peter Galbo, analyst at Bank of America Securities.Kraft Heinz hired Steve Cahillane, the former CEO of Kellogg and then Kellanova, as its chief executive. Once the company separates, Cahillane will serve as chief executive of Global Taste Elevation, the placeholder name for the spinoff with high-growth brands like Heinz and Philadelphia.Steve Cahillane, President and CEO, Kellogg Company accepts Salute To Greatness Corporate Award during 2020 Salute to Greatness Awards Gala at Hyatt Regency Atlanta on January 18, 2020 in Atlanta, Georgia.Paras Griffin | Getty Images Entertainment | Getty ImagesBut acquiring either company resulting from the Kraft Heinz split would be a pretty big acquisition, making it less likely that either is snapped up, according to Galbo. And the resulting uncertainty about the value creation from the breakup is maybe why Berkshire Hathaway, the company's largest shareholder, is preparing to exit its 27.5% stake in Kraft Heinz.Food divestitures pick upA month into the new year, it's unlikely that the divestiture trend will slow down. On Tuesday, General Mills announced that it is selling its Muir Glen brand of organic tomatoes to focus on its core brands. And last week, Bloomberg reported that Nestle is preparing the sale of its water unit; the Swiss giant is also reportedly considering offloading upscale coffee brand Blue Bottle and its underperforming vitamin brands.And if Big Food is making any acquisitions, the deals are more likely to involve \"insurgent brands,\" according to Bain. Over the last five years, acquisitions with a value of less than $2 billion represented 38% of total consumer products deals, up from 16% in the period from 2014 to 2019, the firm said. For example, last year, PepsiCo bought prebiotic soda brand Poppi for $1.95 billion and Hershey snapped up LesserEvil popcorn for $750 million. Bigger deals are harder to come by because of the current regulatory environment, Konanahalli said. Buyers might not be strategic players, but instead private equity firms with plenty of cash on hand. For example, in January, L Catterton bought a majority stake in cottage cheese upstart Good Culture.But a flashy divestiture or acquisition might not be the solution to a food conglomerate's woes — or a surefire way to lift the stock price. Sometimes, good old-fashioned elbow grease can work even better.\"Just because it seems like the wind is blowing your way, it doesn't mean that you can't put in some hard work and turn things around,\" AlixPartners' Konanahalli said.",

    "body": "watch nowPresident Donald Trump has picked Kevin Warsh to succeed Jerome Powell as chair of the Federal Reserve. In keeping with the president's push for lower interest rates, Warsh is expected to be more supportive of cutting the Fed's key benchmark rate later this year. \"I have known Kevin for a long period of time, and have no doubt that he will go down as one of the GREAT Fed Chairmen, maybe the best,\" said Trump in a Truth Social post on Friday. Fed board members are nominated by the president but must be approved by the Senate. If confirmed, Warsh will take over for Powell when his term ends in May, opening the door to a potential change in the direction of monetary policy over the second half of 2026.Warsh, a former Fed governor with a Wall Street background, has been critical of the central bank's handling of inflation in the past and told CNBC in July that its hesitancy to cut interest rates undermined its credibility. \"Based on his past statements and actions in his previous stint as a Fed Governor, Warsh was by far the most hawkish of the four final candidates for Fed Chair,\" said Brett House, an economics professor at Columbia Business School.Read more CNBC personal finance coverageWhat Trump Fed chair pick Kevin Warsh may mean for consumersAverage tax refunds may be $1,000 higher, White House says.

Longer-term rates, like mortgage rates, are more influenced by inflation and other economic factors.\"There was no person who was going to get this job who wasn't going to be cutting rates in the short term,\" David Bahnsen, chief investment officer of The Bahnsen Group, said Friday on CNBC's \"Squawk Box.\" Kevin Warsh, Fellow in Economics at the Hoover Institution and lecturer at the Stanford Graduate School of Business, speaks during the Sohn Investment Conference in New York City, U.S., May 8, 2017. Brendan McDermid | Reuters\"It's too early to judge Kevin Warsh as Fed chair,\" said Mark Higgins, senior vice president at Index Fund Advisors and author of \"Investing in U.S. Financial History: Understanding the Past to Forecast the Future.\" \"What is clear from history, though, is that allowing inflation to persist at elevated levels for too long makes it much harder and far more painful to extinguish later,\" Higgins said.In the 1970s, then-President Richard Nixon, pressured Fed Chair Arthur Burns to keep interest rates low — and give the economy some gas — in the run-up to the 1972 presidential election. That set the stage for runaway inflation, economists now say. Consumer prices surged in the decade that followed and the inflation rate peaked at around 15% in 1980, which remains the highest rate since the post-World War II period.The Fed ultimately, under new leadership, raised interest rates to punishing levels to rein in inflation, leading to surging borrowing costs in the '80s.\"The message to households is uncomfortable but important,\" Higgins said. \"Accepting shorter, more acute economic pain now is preferable to prolonged inflation that continues to erode purchasing power. History is unambiguous on this point.\"Subscribe to CNBC on YouTube.",

    "body": "watch nowThe U.S. government partially shut down early Saturday, despite the Senate passing a funding deal hours earlier.The Senate — by a vote of 71-29 — approved a package of five bills, plus a two-week stopgap measure that gives lawmakers more time to work out disputes over funding for the Department of Homeland Security.But the House of Representatives must also vote to approve the final version of the deal, and it isn't scheduled to return to Washington until Monday. So the federal government entered what is likely to be a short shutdown, following the record 43-day shutdown last year.House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., said on a House GOP conference call earlier Friday afternoon that he will back the Senate-passed funding deal in light of President Donald Trump's support for it, MS NOW reported. Johnson said he hopes the House will pass the bill Monday, according to MS NOW. Once it is approved by the House, the spending package will be sent to Trump to sign.Congressionally approved appropriations expired on Saturday for bills funding the Departments of State, Defense, Financial Services, Homeland Security, Labor, Health and Human Services, Transportation, Education, Housing and Urban Development and related agencies and programs.U.S. Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought, in a memo sent Friday, told federal agency heads that their employees \"should report to work for their next regularly scheduled tour of duty to undertake orderly shutdown activities.\"\"The Administration will continue working with the Congress to address recently raised concerns to complete appropriations for Fiscal Year 2026,\" Vought wrote.\"It is our hope that this lapse will be short,\" he added.The Senate agreement stripped out funding for the Department of Homeland Security and included five other bills to appropriate money for government agencies.The deal called for DHS, which has been the target of scathing criticism by Democrats over its aggressive immigration enforcement actions in Minnesota, to be temporarily funded by a stopgap measure, with the question of long-term funding to be revisited later.The deal had stalled in the Senate as a few Republican holdouts kept lawmakers from quickly considering the package.South Carolina Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham earlier Friday refused to lift the hold he placed on the measure unless he was \"guaranteed a vote\" on his bill to criminalize so-called sanctuary city policies.

That amendment would have required officials to notify senators if their phone records are obtained in a criminal investigation.The House last week included language in the spending package to repeal a law that would have allowed senators to sue for up to $500,000 if their phone records were obtained during Arctic Frost. Graham criticized House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., for the move.Trump, in a Truth Social post on Thursday, encouraged lawmakers to support the deal that would fund most of the federal government through the end of the fiscal year on Sept. 30. Senate leaders had planned a vote on the agreement for Thursday night, but Graham's hold scuttled that effort.",

    "body": "watch nowPresident Donald Trump on Friday named Kevin Warsh to succeed Jerome Powell as Federal Reserve chair, ending a prolonged odyssey that has seen unprecedented turmoil around the central bank.The decision culminates a process that officially began last summer but started much earlier than that, with Trump launching a fusillade of criticism against the Powell-led Fed almost since Powell took the job in 2018. \"I have known Kevin for a long period of time, and have no doubt that he will go down as one of the GREAT Fed Chairmen, maybe the best,\" Trump said in a Truth Social post announcing the selection.The pick of Warsh, 55, likely won't ripple markets because of his past Fed experience and Wall Street's view that he wouldn't always do Trump's bidding.\"He has the respect and credibility of the financial markets,\" said David Bahnsen, chief investment officer of The Bahnsen Group, on CNBC's \"Squawk Box.\"\"There was no person who was going to get this job who wasn't going to be cutting rates in the short term. However, I believe longer term he will be a credible candidate,\" added Bahnsen.Stock market futures nevertheless were slightly negative Friday morning, though off their lows since Warsh's appointment became clear.Warsh now faces Senate confirmation. If approved, he will take over the position in May, when Powell's term expires. Warsh will fill the Board of Governors position currently held by Governor Stephen Miran, whose term expires Saturday.

Even with three successive reductions in the latter part of 2025, Trump kept up the attack, pressing for lower rates and criticizing Powell for cost overruns at the Fed's massive renovation of its Washington, D.C., headquarters.Beyond interest rates, Warsh comes to the Fed at a time when policymakers have taken a looser hand on banking regulations. Among the changes, pushed by Vice Chair for Supervision Michelle Bowman, herself once in the running for Fed chair, are lower capital requirements, reducing supervision and supervisory staff, and backing the Fed out of ancillary efforts like pushing banks to prepare for climate events.For his part, Warsh in a CNBC interview last summer called for \"regime change\" at the Fed.\"The credibility deficit lies with the incumbents that are at the Fed, in my view,\" he said during the July interview. It's a position that could put him in an adversarial role at an institution where consensus building is key to policy implementation.Trump's decision to nominate Warsh comes at one of the most precarious moments for the U.S. central bank in decades — with inflation not fully defeated, government borrowing escalating and the Fed itself facing unusually direct political pressure over how it conducts monetary policy.Most recently, the Justice Department subpoenaed Powell regarding the construction project. In an uncharacteristically blunt response, Powell charged the move was a \"pretext\" to push the Fed into following Trump's orders and ease policy further.To that end, the nomination comes as questions about Fed independence, a bedrock of central bank credibility, have moved from academic debate into concern. Trump and other administration officials have  floated ideas ranging from tighter White House oversight to changes in how the central bank sets rates, including forcing the chair to consult with the president on rate decisions.\"I want to keep it nice and pure, but he certainly wants to cut rates,\" Trump said Friday afternoon during an Oval Office session with reporters. He added that he has not talked with Warsh about cutting rates, though the president said that would be a litmus test for candidates.The nomination ends a competitive derby that at one point included 11 candidates. They spanned from former and current Fed officials to prominent economists and Wall Street pros in an interview process led by Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. Ultimately, the field was winnowed to five then four, with Trump last week hinting to CNBC that he had arrived at his choice. Among the finalists were current Governor Christopher Waller, BlackRock bond chief Rick Rieder and National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett.\"Christopher Waller, Rick Rieder, and others, were interviewed for the Fed position. They all would have been outstanding, and have a great and unlimited future with 'TRUMP.' Such amazing talent in our Country,\" Trump said in a separate Truth Social post. Rieder, thought to be the favorite as recently as Thursday afternoon, congratulated Warsh on the nomination.\"This has been an incredible honor for me,\" Rieder said in a statement to CNBC. \"I congratulate Kevin on his nomination and think he will serve the institution and our nation very well.\"Trump praised Hassett and said he was so good at NEC that he didn't want to move him.\"He is doing such an outstanding job working with me and my team at the White House, that I just didn't want to let him go,\" he said.In a CNBC interview, Hassett said he was not disappointed and wished Warsh well.\"I've got my dream job,\" he said. I think President Trump made a great choice, and I'm really thrilled and humbled by all the kind things he said about me. You know, the bottom line is that the economic team in this White House ... I think we've been hitting on all cylinders, and it's a really bad time to change teams.\"watch nowPolitical challengesFrom here, the nominee faces a tough road.Republican Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina has indicated he will block any Fed nominees until the Justice Department probe is finished. \"Kevin Warsh is a qualified nominee with a deep understanding of monetary policy. However, the Department of Justice continues to pursue a criminal investigation into Chairman Jerome Powell based on committee testimony that no reasonable person could construe as possessing criminal intent,\" Tillis posted Friday on social media site X.\"My position has not changed: I will oppose the confirmation of any Federal Reserve nominee, including for the position of Chairman, until the DOJ's inquiry into Chairman Powell is fully and transparently resolved,\" he added.Hassett told CNBC that the DOJ issue \"could get resolved quickly. The White House is highly, highly confident that Kevin Warsh is a great nominee and that he should be confirmed as soon as possible, and every single resource we have at our disposal is behind him, and behind that outcome.\"The nomination gained support elsewhere in Congress. Sen. Tim Scott, R-S.C., who chairs the Senate banking committee, praised Warsh's \"deep knowledge of markets and monetary policy that will be essential in this role.\"\"The Federal Reserve's decisions touch every American household, from mortgage rates to retirement savings, and President Trump has been clear that bringing accountability and credibility to the Federal Reserve is a priority, and his nomination of Kevin Warsh reflects that focus,\" Scott said.The issues, though, are more than political.Though Trump has insisted that inflation has been vanquished, it remains a good deal from the Fed's 2% target. At the same time, the labor market has slowed, with the economy current in a no-fire, no-hire climate that poses another challenge to Fed policy.In any event, markets don't expect much action from the new chair: Traders are pricing in at most two more cuts this year before the benchmark fed funds rate lands around 3%, which policymakers have indicates is the long-run \"neutral\" rate that neither boosts nor hinders economic growth.Then there's the issue of what happens with Powell.Though chairs historically have resigned their Fed positions after being removed as chair, that may not be the case this time around. Powell has two years remaining in his governor term, and he could choose to serve it as a bulwark against Trump's efforts to compromise Fed independence. The Supreme Court already is weighing Trump's move to unseat Governor Lisa Cook, a case that ultimately could decide what powers a president has over Fed board members.",

You can sign up here to receive it every Friday evening in your inbox.)A combination of big Apple stock sales and steady gains for the share price of American Express has put the credit card company within a few billion dollars of becoming the most valuable holding in Berkshire Hathaway's equity portfolio.In mid-2023, the Apple stake's value of close to $180 billion was around $154 billion greater than the American Express holdings.Since then, Berkshire has sold roughly three-quarters of the position.Last Friday, Apple's lead narrowed to an all-time low was just $4.3 billion. This week it increased to $8.4 billion.The Apple sales are, by far, the biggest factor in the narrowing margin, but American Express stock has outperformed Apple over the past 2 1/2 years with a 106% gain vs. Apple's 35% advance.Buffett first bought 5% of AXP in 1964 when its share price was depressed after it fell victim to loan fraud involving fake salad oil. Berkshire added American Express shares in the 1990s but hasn't done any buying since late in that decade. Its stake as a percentage of AXP's outstanding shares has increased to 22%, however, due to the credit card company's stock buybacks over the year.If Berkshire's Q4 portfolio snapshot, due to be released about two weeks from now, shows even more Apple sales, American Express could be the new number one.Or, if AXP continues to outperform Apple, it may achieve that title without further reductions.BUFFETT & BERKSHIRE AROUND THE INTERNETSome links may require a subscription:Barron's on MSN: Berkshire Hathaway will lose its biggest mutual-fund fan with Danoff's retirementBarron's on MSN: Berkshire Hathaway once had a big silver investment.

(2020)As Warren Buffett was appearing live on CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" on Monday, February 24, 2020, futures were pointing to a drop of 3% for the stock market when it opened due to fears of a coronavirus pandemic.Buffett, however, wasn't worried. He was, in fact, happy that stock prices would be going down.Here are the seven ways he told viewers, in effect, \"Don't panic!\"BECKY QUICK: Let's talk a little bit about the fact that the market's down almost 800 points this morning.WARREN BUFFETT: Yeah.BECKY QUICK: Concern for you?WARREN BUFFETT: Well no, that's good for us actually.I mean we're a net buyer of stocks over time. And just like being a net buyer of food, I expect to buy food the rest of my life, and I hope that food goes down in price tomorrow.So, when stocks are down, no, we're going to be buying, on balance. And who wouldn't rather buy, you know, at a lower price than a higher price?People are really strange on that. I mean they — most people, most of your listeners are savers and that means they'll be net buyers and they should want the stock market to go down. They should want to buy at a lower price.But they got that feeling that they just feel better when stocks are going up.2) 6:03 AM ETBECKY QUICK: When you're looking at the futures down about 818 points this morning, I think probably the first thing viewers want to hear from you are your thoughts on what's happening with the coronavirus, if this is a reason to panic, and if you are worried about this?WARREN BUFFETT: Well, I don't know I have any special thoughts beyond the news on the coronavirus...If you're buying a business, and that's what stocks are, businesses — in fact, people will be better off if they say I bought a business today not a stock today, because that gives a different perspective on it — then presumably if you buy a farm, if you buy an apartment house, if you buy a business, you're going to own it for 10 or 20 or 30 years.And the real question is this — has the 10-year or 20-year outlook for American businesses changed in the last 24 hours or 48 hours?And we're going to — you'll notice many of the businesses we own — partially own — American Express, we've owned it for 20 years; Coca-Cola, we've owned it for 40 years — but those our businesses. And you don't buy or sell your business based on today's headlines.3) 6:05 AM ETBECKY QUICK: But if I think that I can buy something for potentially 10% cheaper, maybe more than that, if I wait a week or a month, maybe that's what I'm sitting around waiting for.WARREN BUFFETT: Well, if you think that you've got — you're going to get fabulously rich if you're right (LAUGHS). All you have to do is just keep buying in 10-day intervals and keep making your 10-day prediction.If I knew what the market was going to do, obviously —But you don't — I don't think anybody knows what the market's going to do.I think you do know whether you're making an intelligent purchase at a given price.4) 6:07 AM ETWARREN BUFFETT: You certainly can't predict the market by reading the daily newspaper, that's for sure.And you really can't — you certainly can't predict the market by listening to me.5) 6:46 AM ETBECKY QUICK: For people who are just waking up, they're tuning in and they want to know what you think about this sell-off this morning — to see the Dow down 700, 800 points in the morning — what's your reaction when you see something like that?WARREN BUFFETT: Well, my reaction is that I like to buy stocks. So, I don't wish ill on anybody else, but I like that — if they want to sell them to me cheaper, I prefer it. (LAUGHS)So, if that's a, you know, roughly, 3% decline or thereabouts — I don't know how many 3% declines I've had in my lifetime, but there have been a lot of them.And I can't think of one that you shouldn't have bought on, you know, basically.That doesn't mean stocks are going to go up or down next week or next month or next year.But if there's something — if you like to own American businesses, you're getting a chance to buy at 3% cheaper.BECKY QUICK: Does that mean Berkshire will be buying stocks today?WARREN BUFFETT: It's — well, we certainly won't be selling. And, yeah, we may — we could easily be buying something, sure.6) 8:02 AM ETBECKY QUICK: Warren, we've talked this morning about the coronavirus, but there are people who are waking up across the country now, kind of tuning in at this hour, so maybe we should address this again.With the markets indicated down 750 points ... how do you kind of wake up and read this and think through it?WARREN BUFFETT: I don't think — it makes no difference in our investments. I mean, there's always going to be some news, good or bad, every day.In fact, if you go back and read all the papers for the last 50 years, probably most of it — headlines — tends to be bad.But if you look at what happens to the economy, most of the things that happen are extremely good. I mean, it's incredible what will happen over time.So, if somebody came and told me that the global growth rate was going to be down 1% instead of a tenth of a percent, I'd still buy stocks if I felt like the business and I like the price at which — and I like the price better today than I liked it last Friday.7) 8:59 AM ETBECKY QUICK: Before we let you go, let's just go back to the futures again this morning because right now the Dow is indicated to open down about a hundred — or 830 points. Weakness again on concerns about coronavirus and what that means.What's your mentality today as you kind of go out and look at the stock market and decide what you're going to do?WARREN BUFFETT: We're buying businesses to own for 20 or 30 years. We buy them in whole, we buy them in part. They're called stocks when we buy them in part. And we think the 20 and 30-year outlook has not changed by coronavirus.BERKSHIRE STOCK WATCHFour weeksTwelve monthsBRK.A stock price: $722,500.00BRK.B stock price: $480.53BRK.B P/E (TTM): 15.37Berkshire market capitalization: $1,037,555,986,394Berkshire Cash as of September 30: $381.7 billion (Up 10.9% from June 30)Excluding Rail Cash and Subtracting T-Bills Payable: $354.3 billion (Up 4.3% from June 30)No Berkshire stock repurchases since May 2024.(All figures are as of the date of publication, unless otherwise indicated)BERKSHIRE'S TOP EQUITY HOLDINGS - Jan. 30, 2026Berkshire's top holdings of disclosed publicly traded stocks in the U.S. and Japan, by market value, based on the latest closing prices.Holdings are as of September 30, 2025, as reported in Berkshire Hathaway's 13F filing on November 14, 2025, except for:Itochu, which is as of March 17, 2025, and Mitsubishi, which is as of August 28, 2025.

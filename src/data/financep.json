    "body": "Colleen McCarthy was working a corporate job she was never \"super excited about\" when she started creating floral arrangements in her free time.Two years later, she's designed floral arrangements for stars like Sabrina Carpenter and Drew Barrymore through her business Colleen Rose Florals.McCarthy, 27, grew up in Ridgefield, CT. She majored in environmental studies and communications at Fordham University, but after she graduated in 2020, \"it was hard to find a job, period, let alone a job that I really wanted to do,\" she says.She landed a job at a PR agency, but viewed the job as a \"temporary thing\" while she figured out her long-term plan.A couple years into her job, McCarthy says she had a \"mini quarter-life crisis\" about her career. She took a step back to reflect: \"What do I like? What have I always liked? What am I good at?\"McCarthy has always loved flowers — \"I would always be the person in my apartment who would buy flowers from the grocery store and arrange them nicely,\" she says — so when she came across floral design as a potential creative career, she decided to give it a try.In late 2022, McCarthy took an introductory class at Flower School New York, a floral design education institution. Beginner classes currently cost about $175, per their website.\"I remember the instructor came over to me, and she was like, 'Oh, is this your first class?' And I said, yeah. And she was like, 'It doesn't seem like it. You seem to have a natural talent for this,'\" she recalls. Hearing that gave her McCarthy the confidence to seriously pursue floral design, she says. 'I just started telling people I was a florist'While still working her full-time job, McCarthy started buying grocery store flowers each week to practice making her floral designs, and she began sharing her work on Instagram and TikTok and in several local Facebook groups.Social media was \"really huge\" in helping McCarthy grow her business, she says. \"I just started telling people I was a florist, even though I wasn't really that established,\" she says. \"I think just telling myself and telling other people, like, 'Yeah, I'm a florist,' it made it happen more easily.\"McCarthy holding one of her floral designs.Jenna Yandle PhotographyHer first official sale was to a member of one of the Facebook groups in March 2023.\"I was just so excited, just the fact that someone would pay for my work,\" she says. \"That was also really validating.\"In May 2023, McCarthy officially registered Colleen Rose Florals as an LLC – a costly process, she says, but ultimately worth it.\"I don't regret it at all, because then I had all the official stuff done, and then when I really started getting more traction and getting more business, I was happy that I had that,\" she says.McCarthy started working with event planners to design florals for brand events, and even booked her first wedding at the end of 2023.\"After I did that, it also gave me so much more confidence that I could do larger-scale events and figure it out,\" she recalls.Focusing on floralsHalfway through 2024, McCarthy says she started to \"really consider\" quitting her day job.\"There were more and more instances where I was having to turn down flower jobs because of my nine to five,\" she says. \"That was kind of a tipping point, I think, because I was like, 'Wait a second, I would like to be saying yes to these opportunities.'\" In December 2024, McCarthy decided to leave her job to focus on running Colleen Rose Florals.\"I kind of was pretty confident that I would be successful,\" she says. \"I didn't really feel nervous or scared about it. I think maybe my mom was a little more nervous than I was.\"In 2025, the first year she focused on the business full-time, Colleen Rose Florals brought in over $175,000.An arrangement McCarthy designed for a brand event.Courtesy of Colleen McCarthyHer main business expense, naturally, is flowers. High-quality blooms are \"really expensive,\" she says, and \"there's a disconnect between what the average consumer thinks flowers cost, and what flowers actually cost.\"McCarthy provides floral arrangements for a variety of occasions, including weddings, brand events, book launches, photoshoots and even concerts.She charges a minimum of $250 for a single \"bespoke\" floral arrangement and typically charges $1,000 or above for smaller events, while small-to-medium weddings can cost between $5,000 and $10,000.Starting in the spring of 2024, Madison Square Garden began commissioning floral arrangements from McCarthy to decorate artists' dressing rooms. This year, she's provided bouquets for the dressing rooms of stars like Katy Perry, Lainey Wilson, Haim and Renee Rapp.One of her most exciting moments was being asked to create a bouquet for Sabrina Carpenter in October.\"That was so exciting and validating, that someone felt confident enough in me to order my work for a huge artist,\" she recalls.A floral arrangement that McCarthy designed for Sabrina Carpenter's dressing room at Madison Square Garden.Courtesy of Colleen McCarthyLooking aheadRight now, Colleen Rose Florals is a solo operation, though McCarthy sometimes hires freelancers to help out with large events.Every day running her floral business is \"super different,\" she says, but she usually wakes up at 6 a.m. to buy flowers from Manhattan's flower district.She typically starts preparing for major events the day before, she says, and depending on the scale of the event, she either takes the flowers back to her apartment, or rents a studio space for the day. McCarthy has to \"process\" each flower – a \"pretty time-consuming\" task of taking off the leaves, cutting the stem, peeling off any old petals, and putting it in water – before she can start working on her arrangements.Once she's finished with her designs, she transports them to the venue by hiring a driver or renting a van herself.A bouquet McCarthy designed for an engagement party.Courtesy of Colleen McCarthyAs a solo business owner, one of the biggest lessons she's learned has been \"knowing when to ask for help,\" she says. \"There have been a couple times where I pulled an all-nighter to finish everything, or I made all these arrangements by myself, when it would have taken half the time if I just asked for help,\" she says.McCarthy's main business goals for 2026 are to rent a permanent studio space and to launch a weekly floral arrangement subscription program as a way to create \"another consistent stream of income.\"She still posts her floral designs on social media, and often receives messages from aspiring florists hoping to learn about her career journey.\"That used to be me, reaching out to florists, wanting to learn from them,\" McCarthy says. \"The fact that I am now someone that others are inspired by is really crazy.\"\"It makes me feel like I'm doing what I'm supposed to be doing,\" she continues.Want to give your kids the ultimate advantage?

    "body": "WASHINGTON — The Federal Reserve on Tuesday released minutes from its highly divisive meeting earlier this month, which concluded with a vote to lower interest rates again that appeared to be an even closer call than the final vote indicated.Officials expressed a variety of opinions during the Dec. 9-10 meeting, according to the summary provided a day ahead of its customary release due to the New Year's holiday.Ultimately, the Federal Open Market Committee approved a quarter-percentage point cut by a 9-3 vote, the most dissents since 2019, as officials debated the need to support the labor market against concerns about inflation. The move lowered the key funds rate to a range of 3.5%-3.75%.\"Most participants judged that further downward adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate would likely be appropriate if inflation declined over time as expected,\" the document said.With that, though, came misgivings over how aggressive the FOMC should be in the future.\"With respect to the extent and timing of additional adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, some participants suggested that, under their economic outlooks, it would likely be appropriate to keep the target range unchanged for some time after a lowering of the range at this meeting,\" the minutes said.Officials expressed confidence that the economy would continue to expand around a \"moderate\" pace, while they saw downside risks to employment and upside risks to inflation. The extent of the two dynamics divided FOMC policymakers, with indications that the vote could have gone either way despite the six-vote victory for the cut.\"A few of those who supported lowering the policy rate at this meeting indicated that the decision was finely balanced or that they could have supported keeping the target range unchanged,\" the minutes said.Stocks held slightly negative following the release. Traders raised bets a bit that the Fed would cut again in April.The vote also came with a quarterly update of the committee's Summary of Economic Projections, including the closely watched \"dot plot\" grid of individual officials' rate expectations.The 19 officials at the December meeting — 12 vote on rates — indicated the likelihood of another cut in 2026 then one more in 2027. That would take the funds rate down to near 3%, a level officials consider as neutral in that it neither restricts nor pushes economic growth.The faction favoring keeping the rate steady \"expressed concern that progress toward the Committee's 2 percent inflation objective had stalled in 2025 or indicated that they needed to have more confidence that inflation was being brought down sustainably to the Committee's objective.\"Officials said President Donald Trump's tariffs were boosting inflation, but they also largely agreed that the impact would be temporary and likely abate into 2026.Since the vote, economic reports have pointed to a labor market where hiring is still slow but layoffs have not accelerated. On the prices side, inflation has been slowly easing but remains a distance away from the Fed's 2% target.At the same time, the broader economy continues to perform well. Gross domestic product soared in the third quarter, rising at a 4.3% annualized pace that was well ahead of estimates and a half-percentage point better than the strong second quarter.However, most of the data carries a significant caveat: Reports are still trailing as government agencies round up data from the dark period during the government shutdown. Even the reports coming in that are more current, at least from official sources, are being weighed with caution due the data gaps.Consequently, markets largely expect the FOMC to stay put over the next few meetings as policymakers weigh incoming data. The holiday season was a quiet one for Fed official commentary and the few comments out there show mostly caution heading into the new year.The committee's complexion also is about to change, with four new regional presidents rotating into voting roles. They will be Cleveland President Beth Hammack, who has expressed opposition not only to additional cuts but also previous ones; Philadelphia President Anna Paulson, who has joined FOMC doves in expressing concern about inflation; Dallas President Lorie Logan, who has voiced concerns about cutting; and Minneapolis President Neel Kashkari, who said he wouldn't have voted for the October cut.Also at the meeting, the committee voted to resume its bond-buying program. Under the new setup, the Fed will be acquiring short-term Treasury bills in an effort to calm pressures in short-term funding markets.The central bank initiated the program by buying $40 billion a month in bills, staying around that level for several months before downshifting. A prior effort to reduce the balance sheet saw the Fed cut its holdings by about $2.3 trillion to its current $6.6 trillion.The minutes noted that unless the buying program, known in markets as quantitative easing, was restarted, it could result in a \"significant declines in reserves\" that would fall below the Fed's \"ample\" regime for the banking system.Correction: The vote came with a quarterly update of the committee's Summary of Economic Projections. An earlier version misstated the name of the forecast.",

Burry recently made headlines with a tech short bet. He said some of America's largest companies were using aggressive accounting to inflate their supposed profits from the artificial intelligence boom.Burry's latest comments on Tesla come shortly after the company took the unusual step of publishing delivery estimates that appear to indicate a lower-than-expected outlook.Deliveries are the closest approximation of vehicle sales reported by Tesla but are not precisely defined in the company's shareholder communications.Read moreTesla on Monday compiled an average estimate for 1.6 million vehicle deliveries in 2025, down roughly 8% from 2024 and putting the company on track for its second straight annual drop.Tesla has endured a roller-coaster ride this year. The company, whose stock recently notched an all-time closing high of $489.88, saw shares collapse in the first quarter amid stiff competition, particularly from Chinese EV manufacturers, and reputational fallout from Musk's incendiary political rhetoric. Shares of Tesla were up slightly in afternoon trading Wednesday. The company's stock has gained more than 12.5% in 2025.— CNBC's Yun Li contributed to this report.Correction: An earlier version of this story used deliveries and sales interchangeably.

Bloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesGold and silver prices lost ground on Wednesday as investors booked profits after a historic annual rally and exchange operator CME Group hiked the margins on precious metal futures for the second time in the space of a week.Spot gold prices dipped 0.1% to $4,339.89 per ounce at 8:50 a.m. ET, extending losses in the run-up to the new year. The yellow metal notched a one-week low in the previous session.Spot silver prices, meanwhile, tumbled 5.6% to $72.15 per ounce, paring gains after climbing above $80 for the first time at the start of the week.The moves come at the end of a blockbuster year for the precious metals.Gold is up more than 64% year to date, on track for its best annual performance since 1979 and third straight positive year. The rally has been supported by a multitude of factors, including the impact of U.S. interest rate cuts, tariff tensions, and robust demand from exchange-traded funds and central banks.  Silver has far outpaced gold in 2025. The metal, which has endured wild price swings in recent days, is on course for annual gains of nearly 150%. Like gold, this would be silver's best yearly performance since 1979. Silver's price boom has stemmed from a mix of low supply and high demand from India, as well as industrial needs and tariffs.watch nowCME Group, one of the world's largest trading floors for commodities, said Tuesday that margins for gold, silver, platinum and palladium would increase again after the close of business Wednesday. It said in a statement that the decision was made \"as per the normal review of market volatility to ensure adequate collateral coverage.\"  The notice means traders will need to put up more cash on their bets to insure against the prospect of a default when they take delivery of the contract.CME Group raised margin requirements for precious metals earlier in the week, prompting gold and silver futures to fall sharply on Monday.— CNBC's Gaelle Legrand contributed to this report.",

    "body": "watch nowLabor market weakness, uncertainty about inflation and political pressure will push the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates aggressively in the early part of 2026, according to Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics.Though markets and Fed officials themselves see only modest easing in the year ahead, Zandi expects the central bank to enact three cuts of a quarter percentage point each before midyear.\"Behind the decision to ease monetary policy further will be the still flagging job market, particularly in the early part of 2026,\" the economist wrote in his look at the year ahead published recently. \"It will take more time for businesses to feel certain that they will not be wrong-footed by shifting trade and immigration policies and other threats before they resume hiring.\"\"Until then, job growth will remain insufficient to forestall further increases in unemployment, and as long as unemployment is on the rise, the Fed will cut rates,\" he added.Zandi's forecast is at least a step ahead of both market and Fed expectations, both of which point to a slower pace of reductions.Market pricing currently points to two cuts, the first not coming until at least April and the second more likely in the back half of the year, probably around September, according to CME futures data as expressed through its FedWatch gauge. Fed policymakers have an even more cautious outlook.The central bank's grid of individual officials' expectations indicates just one cut through the entire year, according to an update presented earlier in December. Minutes from that meeting showed the cut at the meeting was a close call, as officials expressed the likelihood of additional reductions but at a tepid pace.But Zandi thinks the confluence of factors will cause the Fed to move more quickly. One wild card: the potential for President Donald Trump to remake the central bank's hierarchy.As things stand now, three of the seven Fed governors are Trump appointees: Christopher Waller, Michelle Bowman and Stephen Miran. With Miran's term expiring in January, Trump is likely to appoint another loyalist to the post. From there, Chair Jerome Powell's term at the helm expires in May, though his term as governor runs into early 2028. In addition, the president is in the process of trying to remove Governor Lisa Cook, though courts have blocked him so far.That adds to the likelihood that the president, a staunch advocate of lower interest rates, will look to exert his will on the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee.\"Trump will also pressure for lower interest rates. Federal Reserve independence will steadily erode as the president appoints more members to the Federal Open Market Committee, including the Fed chair in May,\" Zandi wrote. \"Given the approaching midterm congressional elections, the political pressure on the Fed to lower rates further to support economic growth is likely to intensify.\"The FOMC meets again on Jan. 27-28. Market pricing is putting just a 13.8% probability of a cut at that meeting, according to the CME.",

(Photo by ARNAUD FINISTRE / AFP) (Photo by ARNAUD FINISTRE/AFP via Getty Images)          Arnaud Finistre | Afp | Getty ImagesIt'll come as no surprise that sales of Champagne peak in the run-up to Christmas and New Year, with French fizz the drink of choice for many households in the festive season.Every year, around 120,000 seasonal workers come to work in France, harvesting grapes across 34,000 hectares of vines. The harvest only lasts a couple of weeks, making it a frenetic time for the sector.A darker side to the industry has emerged when it comes to that work, however, with recent reports shining a light on the exploitation and mistreatment of champagne grape pickers who are often foreign and undocumented migrants.During an extreme heatwave in the late summer of 2023, at least four migrant grape pickers, or \"vendangeurs\" as they're known, died in what has since been dubbed the \"harvest of shame.\"The case highlighted broader substandard working and housing conditions for pickers, including excessive working hours, low pay, a lack of safety equipment and protocols, such as adequate hydration and breaks.The scandal around working conditions and welfare comes at a difficult time for the wider industry — 2024's harvest saw lower yields than average due to spring frosts and a rainy period during the summer that only subsided toward the end of the growing season, just about \"saving\" the harvest. The 2025 harvest fared better and was lauded for its high-quality vintage, thanks to clement weather conditions.Nonetheless, this year's sales, which will be released in January, are likely to be further dented by U.S. import tariffs on goods from the EU, which caused Champagne shipments to the U.S. to slump.'Blatant mistreatment'The murkier side of the Champagne industry came to light when at least four migrant grape pickers died during the 2023 harvest, which took place during an extreme heatwave. Seasonal workers harvest grapes in vineyards in the AOC (Appellation d'origine contrôlée) Champagne region on September 14, 2023 in Châtillon-sur-Marne, France. Thierry Monasse | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesThen, in the summer of 2025, three individuals were put on trial, accused of human trafficking and exploiting over 50 West African migrant workers during the 2023 harvest.The victims reported being treated \"like slaves\" and \"animals\" and being housed in \"hellish\" and unsanitary conditions with no clean drinking water. Such conditions compromised workers' safety, health and dignity, the labor inspectorate said in the case. Unscrupulous hiring practices were also thrust into the spotlight during the trial as the defendants were affiliated with an employment agency which provided workers to the industry, highlighting Champagne houses' widespread use of subcontractors and employment agencies, or more informal channels, to recruit grape pickers. The defendants were convicted and handed fines and prison sentences, while trade unions said the use of \"middlemen\" and agencies had enabled Champagne houses to turn a blind eye to illegal working practices.In a summary of the case which was held in Châlons-en-Champagne criminal court, the prosecutor commented, \"we cannot accept that behind a bottle of Champagne lies uncontrolled subcontracting and blatant mistreatment.\"Sales challengesThe Comité Champagne — the overarching trade body for France's Champagne industry and representing over 16,000 winegrowers, 130 cooperatives and 370 Champagne houses — acknowledged that the court case had damaged the industry's reputation and said it would take a \"zero tolerance\" approach to any future abuses.\"We had to stand with the victims. You don't play games with the health and safety of seasonal workers. Nor do you play games with the image of our appellation,\" Comité co-presidents David Chatillon and Maxime Toubart told Le Monde newspaper in July after the trial. The Comité launched a \"Together for the Champagne Harvest\" action plan to ensure that worker health and safety protocols and worker accommodations were improved, as well as harvest regulations.  A French General Confederation of Labour (CGT) union member hands out pamphlets to seasonal grape pickers, often foreign workers, in a Champagne vineyard to inform them of their labour rights, in Igny-Comblizy, eastern France, on September 19, 2024. Francois Nascimbeni | Afp | Getty ImagesChampagne winegrowers and houses have been keen to show they are committed to workers' well-being. Moët & Chandon, the world's largest producer and part of LVMH, invested 1.5 million euros ($1.76 million) in new accommodation for an extra 90 grape pickers in 2024, bringing the total capacity of its accommodation provision to up to 1,900 beds. CNBC asked the Comité Champagne whether welfare measures had been fully implemented by its member organizations since they were proposed, but has not yet received a response. CNBC also contacted several unions, including the CGT labor union and SGV union of Champagne growers, about the reforms, but did not receive responses. watch nowIt's no doubt a difficult time for the wider industry — 2024's harvest saw lower yields than average due to spring frosts and a rainy period during the summer that only subsided toward the end of the growing season — just about \"saving\" the harvest. The 2025 harvest fared better and was lauded for its high-quality vintage, thanks to clement weather conditions.Synonymous with north-eastern France, Champagne accounts for 10% of the world's sparkling wine production by volume, but as much as 35% of sparkling wine's global market value.However, sales have declined in recent years amid a fall in global demand and declining alcohol consumption.In 2023, shipments of Champagne (which are typically a mix of several years' harvests) totalled 299 million bottles, down 8.2% compared to the previous year. In 2024, 271 million bottles were shipped, according to the Comité Champagne data. This year's sales face additional headwinds from U.S. import tariffs on goods from the EU.The industry has also faced challenges from within, with the CGT labor union at LVMH's Moët & Chandon and Veuve Clicquot's champagne units calling on workers to strike in December over the cancellation of year-end bonuses and demands for better pay. A spokesman for Moët & Chandon told CNBC that it would not comment on the dispute but that negotiations over pay would take place in early 2026, noting, \"we cannot comment before the negotiations.\" If sales keep falling, the treatment of seasonal pickers will be just one challenge facing the industry.",

    "body": "watch nowMortgage rates are lower, home prices are easing and there is more supply on the market for sale. All of that adds up to improved affordability for today's homebuyers. Saving for a down payment, however, is still the biggest hurdle for first-time buyers. Prices nationally are basically flat compared with where they were a year ago, according to Parcl Labs, which runs daily studies of U.S. home prices. They dipped into negative territory earlier this month and are now just 0.3% higher year over year. The latest S&P Cotality Case-Shiller home price index, which reflects pricing from October, showed large disparities among metropolitan markets. Of the top 20 markets it highlights, Chicago; New York; and Cleveland had the biggest gains. Meanwhile eight cities showed prices in negative territory, with Tampa, Florida; Phoenix; and Dallas seeing the biggest losses. \"National home prices also continue to lag consumer inflation, as October's CPI is estimated around 3.1% (based on a provisional index the U.S. Treasury announced due to the federal data shutdown) – roughly 1.8 percentage points higher than the latest housing appreciation. In real terms, that gap implies a slight decline in inflation-adjusted home values over the past year,\" explained Nicholas Godec, head of fixed income tradables and commodities at S&P Dow Jones Indices, in a release.Mortgage rates, too, are coming down. The average on the 30-year fixed mortgage is currently at 6.19%, according to Mortgage News Daily. It started this year well over 7%. That decline means significant savings for homebuyers. For example, for a buyer putting down 20% on a $410,000 home (right around the national median), the monthly payment today is $200 less on average than it would have been a year ago. Weaker prices and lower rates are changing the math on what first-time buyers can afford. Get Property Play directly to your inboxCNBC's Property Play with Diana Olick covers new and evolving opportunities for the real estate investor, delivered weekly to your inbox.Subscribe here to get access today.The typical homebuyer now needs seven years to save for a down payment, according to Realtor.com. That's down from the recent peak of 12 years in 2022, but still roughly double pre-pandemic levels, partly because the personal savings rate is so much lower than it was in 2020. Down payments continue to be the biggest hurdle to homeownership, which in the second half of this year fell to 65%, according to the U.S. Census, the lowest level since 2019.But an improved supply of homes for sale is adding momentum to the market. Active listings are now about 12% higher than they were a year ago, according to Realtor.com, but still 6% lower than they were just pre-pandemic.And buyers appear to be responding. Pending home sales, which count signed contracts on existing homes, rose more than expected in November. They were 3.3% higher than October, 2.6% higher than November 2024 and hit the highest level in nearly three years, according to the National Association of Realtors. \"Improving housing affordability–driven by lower mortgage rates and wage growth rising faster than home prices–is helping buyers test the market. More inventory choices compared to last year are also attracting more buyers to the market,\" said Lawrence Yun, chief economist for the Realtors, in a release. ",

    "body": "©Studio One-one | Moment Unreleased | Getty ImagesDepending on where you live, relying on a postmark to prove you mailed your tax return, mail-in ballot, bill payment or any other time-sensitive document by a specific date may no longer work as you expect.As the U.S. Postal Service continues implementing operational changes in an effort to shore up its finances and modernize its infrastructure, the agency expects an increase in delays between when you mail something and when it is postmarked, according to a public notice in the Federal Register that took effect Dec. 24. A postmark shows the date your mail was processed, and historically has been applied the same day you mail an item. However, due to limiting pickups at many postal locations and mail now often traveling farther to regional processing centers where the postmark is applied, \"the postmark date does not inherently or necessarily align with the date on which the Postal Service first accepted possession of the mailpiece,\" the notice reads.Read more CNBC personal finance coverageUSPS changes may delay postmarks.

Here's who the lapse will hit hardestTrump officials to start garnishing wages of student loan borrowers in JanuaryCNBC's Financial Advisor 100: Best financial advisors, top firms rankedWhile households increasingly use digital options to file taxes, pay bills and handle other personal business, there are still people who use the Postal Service for time-sensitive mail.Of the 163.6 million tax returns received by the IRS this year, about 10 million were not filed electronically, according to the agency's latest data. About 29% of voters mailed in their ballots last year, according to USAFacts. And 13% of households paid their bills by mail last year, according to the Postal Service's 2024 Household Diary Study. \"Consumers have always assumed that the post office will postmark their mail on the day they take it to the post office or drop it in a box,\" said Edgar Dworsky, founder of advocacy site Consumer World and a former assistant attorney general in Massachusetts who focused on consumer protection. \"Who would expect it could be several days before it has a postmark on it?\"Mail is traveling farther to processing facilitiesWhile the Postal Service said in the notice that it is not changing how it postmarks mail — that has always been done at its processing facilities — the agency has added language to its Domestic Mail Manual to clarify for the public when postmarks are applied.In 2021, USPS unveiled an initiative called Delivering for America to improve its financial condition, which included increasing postage prices and redesigning its network and processing operations.Changes to transportation schedules and the consolidation of processing facilities under that initiative mean many post offices that previously sent mail twice a day to a hub now do so only once in the morning, according to new research from the Brookings Institution. Under the new network, roughly 26% of post offices are within 50 miles of their assigned regional center, and another 26% are between 150 and 500 miles away, according to the research.The upshot is that some mail generally doesn't begin moving through the system until at least the following day, resulting in the postmark not being applied the day you mailed that item. In some cases — i.e., ahead of weekends or holidays — it could take longer than a day for that crucial stamp to be applied.How to meet mailing deadlines amid postmark delaysThe importance of ensuring your mail is postmarked in time applies to a range of documents or forms that have deadlines. For example, ballots that are mailed can require a postmark by a specific date to be counted, as can federal and state tax returns and certain legal documents.If someone wants to ensure \"that the postmark aligns with the date of mailing, the customer may take the mailpiece to a post office, station or branch and request a [manual postmark] at the retail counter,\" according to a statement issued by the Postal Service.Asking a postal clerk to manually postmark something costs nothing. Or, you can pay $5.30 to send a time-sensitive document via certified mail, which includes a receipt for the sender as well as a return receipt showing when it was delivered and who signed for it. Alternatively, a certificate of mailing, which you keep for your records, costs $2.40 and shows the date you mailed something.\"Waiting in line at the post office is never fun, but you get that proof of timely mailing,\" said Josh Youngblood, an enrolled agent and founder of The Youngblood Group in Dallas. \"The reality is, otherwise, you are at the mercy of whenever that postmark gets applied.\"Given the possibility of a delay, you may want to explore electronic filing or payment options when available. Or, give yourself a deadline to mail something important well ahead of the official due date.Considerations for mailing tax returnsAhead of tax filing season, it's worth taking note of the possible delay. While April 15 is when federal taxes are due, the IRS considers any tax return postmarked on or before April 15 as being filed on time, even if it's not received until days later.So if you are prone to waiting until the last minute to file taxes and do not do it electronically, you can't assume dropping off your return at the post office or putting it in a mailbox means it will get postmarked that day.\"If I'm mailing something to the IRS, I'm going to go into the post office to the actual person, where they stamp it,\" Youngblood said.If your tax return is postmarked late and you owe taxes, you may face penalties and interest. \"There is a penalty for filing late, and even a day late is still late,\" Youngblood said.For individual tax returns — i.e., your Form 1040 — the penalty for filing a late return is 5% of the tax due for each month or partial month the return is late, capping out at 25%. On top of that, the penalty for paying late is 0.5% of your unpaid balance per month, also capped at 25%. Interest is also charged on unpaid balances, accruing daily at the federal short-term rate plus 3%.However, if you have filed and paid taxes owed on time over the previous three years, you can request that the penalties be waived, Youngblood said.",

    "body": "File: President Donald Trump looks on after signing an executive order in the Oval Office of the White House on April 9, 2025.Saul Loeb | Afp | Getty ImagesPresident Donald Trump issued the first vetoes of his second term Tuesday, blocking bills that would support a pair of bipartisan infrastructure projects in Colorado and Florida. Trump's veto of the Colorado bill, the Finish the Arkansas Valley Conduit Act, which Congress unanimously approved earlier in December, enraged the state's lawmakers. The bill would reduce the payments local communities must provide to the federal government for the construction of the Arkansas Valley Conduit, a pipeline poised to provide clean drinking water to rural communities in Colorado. In a message to Congress after vetoing the legislation, Trump said the bill would \"continue the failed policies of the past by forcing Federal taxpayers to bear even more of the massive costs of a local water project — a local water project that, as initially conceived, was supposed to be paid for by the localities using it.\"\"Enough is enough. My Administration is committed to preventing American taxpayers from funding expensive and unreliable policies,\" he said. Bipartisan Colorado lawmakers who pushed the bill erupted after the veto, vowing Congress will override it. Some argued that Trump is making good on his vow for retribution after Colorado refused to free Tina Peters, a former Colorado county clerk who was convicted last year of crimes relating to the breach of voting machines after the 2020 election.Trump warned earlier this year in a Truth Social post that if she was not released, he would \"take harsh measures!!!\" Trump issued a pardon for Peters in December, but it was largely symbolic since Peters was convicted in a state court.Read more CNBC politics coverageEuropean Union approves over $105 billion toward Ukraine aid package for next two yearsBrown and MIT prof shooter suspect Neves Valente is found dead, authorities saysTrump Media to merge with fusion company TAE Technologies, DJT stock soarsTrump announces 'warrior dividend' of $1,776 to U.S. soldiers in prime-time speechEpstein accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell petitions to vacate sex crime convictionCongressional stock trading ban bill to get a vote in new year: House RepublicansFBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino is stepping down in JanuaryObamacare subsidies extension to get vote after 4 Republicans buck leadershipFCC chief Carr tells Senate that his agency is 'not formally ... independent'Trump vowed to block tankers carrying Venezuela's oil — nearly a dozen at sea nowKennedy Center to be renamed 'Trump-Kennedy Center,' White House saysTrump vowed to block tankers carrying Venezuela's oil — nearly a dozen at sea nowHouse passes bill to ease permits for building out AI infrastructureTrump sues BBC for $10 billion, claims defamation from Panorama documentaryPentagon takes big stake in new Korea Zinc refinery in Tenn., gets 10% of companyNew Trump tariffs collection hits $200 billion, Customs saysFormer Instacart employee says she was fired over her Democratic congressional campaignUkraine peace talks progressing, Russia open to EU membership, U.S. officials sayNew York AG sues UPS for allegedly shorting Christmas season workers' wagesTrump admin to hire 1,000 specialists for 'Tech Force'Trump doubles down on Rob Reiner criticism after killing; director's son in custodyTSA is giving airline passenger data to ICE for deportation push: NYTTrump's AI order may be 'illegal,' Democrats and consumer advocacy groups claimTrump sued by preservation group seeking to halt White House ballroom projectTrump says 'no big deal' after new Epstein photos showing him releasedPutin can fund war for years, ex-official says as Trump's resolve is testedIndiana redistricting bill that Trump demanded defeated in state SenateHouse passes INVEST Act to ease investment standards, boost capital in marketsDOJ fails again to indict New York AG James, a Trump target: ReportsTrump 'sells out' U.S. national security with Nvidia chip sales to China: WarrenTrump pushes for top prosecutor nominee Halligan after Comey, James cases tossedTrump willing to seize more oil tankers off Venezuela coast: White HouseSeized tanker will go to U.S. port, Trump admin intends 'to seize the oil'GOP lawmakers seek Trump aid for agricultural equipment after tariff pressureTrump says Fed could have 'at least doubled' latest interest rate cut'Spoof' ship: Seized oil tanker hid location, visited Iran and VenezuelaTrump admin touts pulling 9,500 truckers off road for failing English testsSwiss government says new 15% U.S. tariff ceiling retroactive to mid-NovemberHomeland Security Dept. buying Boeing 737s for ICE deportationsTrump officials move to end student loan payment pause for millions of borrowersJudge unseals Ghislaine Maxwell grand jury materials, citing Epstein files actUkraine at 'critical moment' in war as European allies ramp up pressure on RussiaDemocrats establish AI working group as industry bolsters DC presenceEx-Trump lawyer Habba resigns as NJ U.S. attorney after disqualification\"This isn't governing.

I'll keep fighting to get rural Colorado the clean water they deserve.\"Sen. John Hickenlooper, D-Colo., also alleged Trump's veto was partisan. \"Donald Trump is playing partisan games and punishing Colorado by making rural communities suffer without clean drinking water,\" Hickenlooper said on X. \"Congress should swiftly overturn this veto.\"GOP Rep. Lauren Boebert, a staunch Trump ally, said on her X account that \"This isn't over.\"In a statement she gave to Colorado-based NBC-affiliate KUSA, Boebert said she \"hope[s] this veto has nothing to do with political retaliation for calling out corruption and demanding accountability.\"Boebert was one of the Republicans who joined Democrats in compelling the release of files related to notorious sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Trump did not mention Peters in his rationale for vetoing the legislation. On Wednesday, however, he issued a Truth Social post saying, \"God Bless Tina Peters, who is now, for two years out of nine, sitting in a Colorado Maximum Security Prison.\"\"Hard to wish her a Happy New Year, but to the Scumbag Governor, and the disgusting 'Republican' (RINO!) DA, who did this to her (nothing happens to the Dems and their phony Mail In Ballot System that makes it impossible for a Republican to win an otherwise very winnable State!), I wish them only the worst. May they rot in Hell,\" the President wrote.Congress' unanimous passage of the bill suggests it will have the votes to override Trump's veto if GOP leadership in both chambers allows it. Two-thirds of both the House and the Senate would be needed to override the veto.Rep. Jeff Hurd, another Colorado Republican, said in a post to X that he will \"continue fighting for rural Colorado by working across party lines to get this project back on track and ensure our communities are not left behind.\" CNBC has reached out to House Speaker Mike Johnson's office to ask if he will allow the chamber to override the veto. The Florida bill Trump vetoed, the Miccosukee Reserved Area Amendments Act, also passed Congress by voice vote. The bill would have expanded the Miccosukee Reserved Area to include an area known as the Osecola Camp, part of the Everglades National Park. Trump in a message to Congress said he vetoed the bill in part to prevent \"American taxpayers from funding projects for special interests, especially those that are unaligned with my Administration's policy of removing violent criminal illegal aliens from the country.\"In Trump's first term, he vetoed a total of 10 bills. His first veto came in 2019, two years into his term, to overturn a congressional move to end a national emergency at the southern border. Congress failed to override that veto.",

    "body": "Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz speaks about the killing of state Rep. Melissa Hortman and her husband at the State Emergency operations Center in Blaine, Minn.. Saturday, June 14, 2025.Jerry Holt | Star Tribune via APCongressional Republicans on Wednesday called Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz to testify amid an ongoing social services fraud scandal, as the White House signaled it could expand its investigations into other blue states.A day after the Trump administration said it would freeze hundreds of millions of dollars of child-care funds to Minnesota, House Oversight and Government Reform Chair James Comer, R-Ky., invited Walz and Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison, both Democrats, to appear before the panel on Feb. 10. \"Minnesota Governor Tim Walz and Attorney General Keith Ellison have either been asleep at the wheel or complicit in a massive fraud involving taxpayer dollars in Minnesota's social services programs,\" Comer said in a Wednesday statement.An earlier hearing, slated for Jan. 7, will feature Minnesota state officials who sounded the alarm or investigated the fraud.\"American taxpayers demand and deserve accountability for the theft of their hard-earned money,\" he continued.Walz, who took office in 2019, has come under fire in recent months over fraud scams that occurred during his administration. He has recently faced calls to resign. The scandals date back several years and may have cost taxpayers billions of dollars, according to prosecutors.Republicans, including President Donald Trump, have seized on reports of fraud to target Walz and other Democratic leaders, as well as Somalis living in Minnesota.Read more CNBC politics coverageEuropean Union approves over $105 billion toward Ukraine aid package for next two yearsBrown and MIT prof shooter suspect Neves Valente is found dead, authorities saysTrump Media to merge with fusion company TAE Technologies, DJT stock soarsTrump announces 'warrior dividend' of $1,776 to U.S. soldiers in prime-time speechEpstein accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell petitions to vacate sex crime convictionCongressional stock trading ban bill to get a vote in new year: House RepublicansFBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino is stepping down in JanuaryObamacare subsidies extension to get vote after 4 Republicans buck leadershipFCC chief Carr tells Senate that his agency is 'not formally ... independent'Trump vowed to block tankers carrying Venezuela's oil — nearly a dozen at sea nowKennedy Center to be renamed 'Trump-Kennedy Center,' White House saysTrump vowed to block tankers carrying Venezuela's oil — nearly a dozen at sea nowHouse passes bill to ease permits for building out AI infrastructureTrump sues BBC for $10 billion, claims defamation from Panorama documentaryPentagon takes big stake in new Korea Zinc refinery in Tenn., gets 10% of companyNew Trump tariffs collection hits $200 billion, Customs saysFormer Instacart employee says she was fired over her Democratic congressional campaignUkraine peace talks progressing, Russia open to EU membership, U.S. officials sayNew York AG sues UPS for allegedly shorting Christmas season workers' wagesTrump admin to hire 1,000 specialists for 'Tech Force'Trump doubles down on Rob Reiner criticism after killing; director's son in custodyTSA is giving airline passenger data to ICE for deportation push: NYTTrump's AI order may be 'illegal,' Democrats and consumer advocacy groups claimTrump sued by preservation group seeking to halt White House ballroom projectTrump says 'no big deal' after new Epstein photos showing him releasedPutin can fund war for years, ex-official says as Trump's resolve is testedIndiana redistricting bill that Trump demanded defeated in state SenateHouse passes INVEST Act to ease investment standards, boost capital in marketsDOJ fails again to indict New York AG James, a Trump target: ReportsTrump 'sells out' U.S. national security with Nvidia chip sales to China: WarrenTrump pushes for top prosecutor nominee Halligan after Comey, James cases tossedTrump willing to seize more oil tankers off Venezuela coast: White HouseSeized tanker will go to U.S. port, Trump admin intends 'to seize the oil'GOP lawmakers seek Trump aid for agricultural equipment after tariff pressureTrump says Fed could have 'at least doubled' latest interest rate cut'Spoof' ship: Seized oil tanker hid location, visited Iran and VenezuelaTrump admin touts pulling 9,500 truckers off road for failing English testsSwiss government says new 15% U.S. tariff ceiling retroactive to mid-NovemberHomeland Security Dept. buying Boeing 737s for ICE deportationsTrump officials move to end student loan payment pause for millions of borrowersJudge unseals Ghislaine Maxwell grand jury materials, citing Epstein files actUkraine at 'critical moment' in war as European allies ramp up pressure on RussiaDemocrats establish AI working group as industry bolsters DC presenceEx-Trump lawyer Habba resigns as NJ U.S. attorney after disqualificationAlso on Wednesday, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said during an appearance on \"Fox & Friends\" that other states could be next and that Trump was on board with revoking the citizenship of implicated Somali Americans.\"Minnesota is the top of the list, but we know there has been massive fraud in blue states across this country. Look at California. Look at New York. These states will all be under investigation and consideration as far as this administration is concerned,\" Leavitt said.\"Much of the Minnesota Fraud, up to 90%, is caused by people that came into our Country, illegally, from Somalia,\" Trump said Wednesday in a Truth Social post in which he also attacked Rep. Ilhan Omar, a Minnesota Democrat and the first Somali American to serve in Congress. Trump called Omar \"an ungrateful loser.\"Omar could not be reached for comment on Wednesday.\"Lowlifes like this can only be a liability to our Country's greatness. Send them back from where they came, Somalia, perhaps the worst, and most corrupt, country on earth,\" Trump said. He also called Walz a \"crooked governor.\"A spokesperson for Walz, who was Kamala Harris' running mate on the Democratic presidential ticket in 2024, responded on Wednesday: \"We're always happy to work with Congress, though this committee has a track record of holding circus hearings that have nothing to do with the issue at hand.\" \"While the Governor has been working to ensure fraudsters go to prison, the President has been selling pardons to let them out,\" the statement continued.In a Wednesday press release, Ellison defended his record, claiming he has \"prosecuted over 300 Medicaid fraud cases and won over $80 million in recoveries and restitution for the people of Minnesota,\" since taking office in 2019.Ellison also said he and his team were \"exploring all legal options\" in response to the halted child-care funds.\"This hasty, scorched earth-attack is not just wrong, it may well be illegal,\" Ellison said.The freezing of child-care money, as well as FBI Director Kash Patel's Sunday announcement of a surge of federal agents to Minnesota, followed a viral video posted over the weekend by a conservative influencer that purported to show nonoperational child-care facilities that received federal funds. The video brought renewed attention to long-simmering allegations of fraud that have raised questions about Walz's leadership and led to the targeting of Minnesota's large Somali community for its alleged role in various schemes.U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Deputy Secretary Jim O'Neill and Assistant Secretary Alex Adams announced the funding freeze in a post Tuesday on X. O'Neill also announced a nationwide verification system to authorize child-care payments, demanded that Walz investigate individuals suspected of fraud and announced a fraud-reporting hotline.\"We believe the state of Minnesota has allowed scammers and fake daycares to siphon millions of taxpayer dollars over the past decade,\" O'Neill said.\"Funds will be released only when states prove they are being spent legitimately,\" O'Neill wrote in a subsequent post.Vice President JD Vance applauded the move.\"Turning off payments and forcing verification before taxpayer money flows out the door is one of the most important steps we can take to end the fraud in Minnesota. But there will be many more to come,\" Vance said Tuesday on X. Attorney General Pam Bondi on Monday posted that 98 individuals had been charged and more than 60 had been found guilty in court. Of those charged, 85 are of Somali descent, according to Bondi.\"We have more prosecutions coming…BUCKLE UP, LAWMAKERS!\" Bondi said on X.Investigations into Minnesota's social services program date back several years. A federal prosecutor in Minnesota said earlier this month that more than a dozen Medicaid-funded programs were being probed and that as much as half of the $18 billion in taxpayer funds spent on those programs since 2018 may have been stolen.One Covid-era scam, which hinged on a Minnesota nonprofit called Feeding Our Future, led to charges for dozens of defendants who allegedly stole $250 million in taxpayer funds.Walz has come under fire for allowing the fraud to transpire on his watch. This weekend, a group of Minnesota Republicans called on Walz to resign, citing the state's \"fraud crisis.\"House Majority Whip Tom Emmer, R-Minn., has also called on Walz to step down. In a statement to CNBC on Wednesday, Emmer praised the Trump administration's actions and took aim at his state's governor.\"Tim Walz's incompetence and inaction has hurt every Minnesotan, and now Walz is suffering the consequences,\" Emmer said. \"His failed leadership has allowed billions to be stolen from hardworking Minnesota taxpayers.\"",

Jonas Walzberg | ReutersChina has urged the Netherlands to swiftly correct its \"mistakes\" over chipmaker Nexperia and restore stability in the global semiconductor industry, in the latest development in a dispute over technology transfer.In September, the Dutch government invoked a Cold War-era law to effectively take control of Nexperia, a Chinese-owned chipmaker based in the Netherlands. The unusual move was reportedly made after the U.S. raised security concerns.In response, China moved to block its products from leaving China, which, in turn, raised the alarm among global automakers as they faced shortages of the chipmaker's components.On Wednesday, a spokesperson for China's Commerce Ministry said that the Netherlands should \"immediately correct its mistakes and clear the obstacles to restoring the stability and security of the global semiconductor supply chain.\"\"What is perplexing is that, faced with the anxiety and unease of the global industry, the Netherlands remains indifferent and stubbornly insists on its own way, showing absolutely no responsible attitude towards the security of the global semiconductor supply chain, and taking no substantive action whatsoever,\" the spokesperson said in a statement, according to a Google translation.A spokesperson for the Dutch government was not immediately available to comment when contacted by CNBC on Wednesday morning. Dutch Economy Minister Vincent Karremans has repeatedly defended his decision to intervene in the company over recent weeks. Read moreNexperia manufactures billions of so-called foundation chips — transistors, diodes and power management components — that are produced in Europe, assembled and tested in China, and then re-exported to customers in Europe and elsewhere. The low-tech, inexpensive chips are needed in almost every device that uses electricity. In cars, they're used to connect the battery to motors, for lights and sensors, for braking systems, airbag controllers, entertainment systems and electric windows.Auto industry groups have said that disruptions in the supply chain for Nexperia parts have not yet been fundamentally resolved, meaning that component availability remains uncertain.Japan's Nissan and German auto supplier Bosch are among the firms to have warned about looming shortages. Speaking to CNBC last month, a spokesperson for the German Association of the Automotive Industry (VDA), which represents Volkswagen, Mercedes-Benz Group and BMW among hundreds of others, warned of elevated risks to supply, \"particularly for the first quarter\" of 2026. — CNBC's Annika Kim Constantino contributed to this report.",

    "body": "As the restaurant industry endured another difficult year, many chains opted to close underperforming locations as they try to turn around their businesses.Inflation-weary consumers have pulled back their restaurant spending, choosing to eat at home or chasing deals when they go out for a meal. While some restaurants have won over reluctant diners, the industry has largely struggled with the sales slump. Traffic to restaurants open at least a year fell every month in 2025, excluding only July, according to Black Box Intelligence. In years past, restaurant closures have been more concentrated across casual-dining chains, which lost customers to fast-casual competitors like Chipotle. But this year, chains across the industry announced plans to shutter at least hundreds of locations.In such a tough environment, some restaurant companies even filed for bankruptcy protection. Hooters, Pinstripes and On the Border were some of the notable names that landed in bankruptcy court this year.Here are the chains that announced closures in 2025:StarbucksA Starbucks coffee cup sits on a table inside a Starbucks in New York on Dec. 2, 2025.Spencer Platt | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesIn September, the coffee giant announced a $1 billion restructuring plan that included closing roughly 500 of its North American locations. The closures even extended to shuttering its upscale Reserve Roastery cafe in Seattle, the company's hometown.Starbucks' announcement followed CEO Brian Niccol's one-year anniversary at the helm of the company. Under his leadership, Starbucks is trying to reverse a sales slump in the U.S., its biggest market. Executives plan to share more details about the turnaround at the company's upcoming investor day in late January in New York. Wendy'sA Wendy's restaurant sign in Austin, Texas, Nov. 10, 2025.Brandon Bell | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesIn November, Wendy's announced that it would undergo a strategic review of its restaurant footprint and begin closing underperforming locations that quarter. While the company did not announce a specific number of closures, interim CEO and CFO Ken Cook told analysts that the company could shutter a \"mid-single digit percentage\" of its U.S. restaurants shuttering, which would mean hundreds of the burger chain's locations.The closures are one phase of Wendy's \"Project Fresh\" turnaround plan. The company has reported same-store sales declines even as rivals McDonald's and Burger King see higher demand for their Big Macs and Whoppers.In 2024, Wendy's shuttered about 140 locations.Denny'sA view of a Denny's restaurant in Hayward, California, Feb. 14, 2025.Justin Sullivan | Getty ImagesIn February, Denny's said it planned to close between 70 and 90 restaurants in 2025. In recent months, the diner chain's sales sunk as customers opted to visit cheaper fast-food restaurants for breakfast. The shift in behavior led the company to shutter underperforming locations and attempt to improve the rest of its restaurant footprint.In November, the chain announced it had sold itself for $620 million to Yadav Enterprises, TriArtisan Capital Advisors and Treville Capital Group. The deal is expected to close in the first quarter of 2026, pending regulatory approval.Jack in the BoxGeri Lavrov | Getty ImagesIn April, Jack in the Box said it would close between 150 and 200 restaurants as part of its \"Jack on Track\" strategy to improve its financial performance. By the end of its fiscal 2025 on Sept. 28, the chain had permanently shuttered 86 restaurants. Bahama BreezeIn May, Bahama Breeze parent company Darden Restaurants closed 15 of the chain's locations, which represents roughly a third of its overall footprint. Following the closures, executives decided that the Caribbean-inspired chain was not a strategic priority for Darden, so the company is exploring strategic alternatives for the brand. Options include selling the chain outright or converting its restaurants into other Darden brands, like Olive Garden. Darden expects to make a decision on Bahama Breeze by the end of its fiscal 2026, which concludes in May.Hardee'sDozens of Hardee's locations will close by end of the year after the franchisor sued ARC Burger, one of its largest franchisees. Hardee's alleges that the operator fell behind on payments like royalties, rent and taxes. ARC, which is owned by private equity firm High Bluff Capital Partners, operated 77 Hardee's restaurants before the legal battle began. Its footprint stretched across eight states, including Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Missouri, Montana, South Carolina and Wyoming, according to legal filings.Papa John'sThe Papa John's Pizza logo is shown in Austin, Texas, May 9, 2024.Brandon Bell | Getty ImagesIn the first three quarters of 2025, Papa John's shuttered 173 restaurants worldwide, according to company filings. Most of the closures affected international locations, although 62 of the pizza chain's U.S. locations also closed.Despite the closures, Papa John's still had nearly 6,000 restaurants in operation at the end of September.Noodles & Co.Michael Siluk | UCG | Universal Images Group | Getty ImagesAt the end of October, Noodles & Co. had closed 29 company-owned restaurants this year, and executives said that they planned to shutter another two to five underperforming locations by the end of 2025. In 2024, the fast-casual chain closed 20 locations.By the end of 2026, Noodles & Co. is planning to close another 12 to 17 stores, as it aims to improve the company's financial performance and boost sales at the chain's nearby locations.Outback SteakhouseAn Outback Steakhouse restaurant in Daly City, California, Jan. 31, 2025.Justin Sullivan | Getty ImagesIn October, restaurant company Bloomin' Brands closed 21 locations across the company. The closures hit Outback Steakhouse, the gem of its portfolio, as well as Bonefish Grill and Carrabba's Italian Grill.Bloomin' has identified nearly two dozen other restaurants that will not renew their leases when they expire over the next four years, executives said in November when sharing the company's quarterly earnings. At the same time, the company announced a $75 million turnaround plan to improve Bloomin' sales and its overall financial health.",

    "body": "Google CEO Sundar Pichai waves as he arrives at the Artificial Intelligence Action Summit at the Grand Palais in Paris, Feb. 11, 2025.Benoit Tessier | ReutersAfter a tough start to the year, Google closed out 2025 with its strongest performance — from Wall Street's perspective — since 2009, when the company's shares doubled coming out of the financial crisis. Alphabet's stock popped 65% for the year, slightly ahead of its gains in 2021. The shares hit their 2025 low in April, as President Donald Trump was threatening massive tariffs on trading partners, but they've since jumped over 100%. Among the eight tech companies valued at over $1 trillion, Alphabet was by far the biggest gainer. The next sharpest rallies came from chipmakers Broadcom and Nvidia, which gained 49% and 39%, respectively. Stock Chart IconStock chart iconAlphabet vs. the Nasdaq in 2025Getting to this point required Google to stare down the skeptics, who questioned whether the search giant could maintain its dominance in the artificial intelligence era. With OpenAI's ChatGPT and Sora services capturing an increasing amount of consumer engagement and concerns swirling around the future of online advertising in a world of AI chatbots and agents, Google's business model was viewed as a target for major disruption. Alphabet's 18% plunge in the first quarter was its worst period for the stock since mid-2022. But the mood started to improve in the second quarter. In April, the company promoted 16-year company veteran Josh Woodward to run the Gemini app, Google's answer to ChatGPT. In August, Woodward's group debuted image generator Nano Banana, a Gemini feature that lets users turn to AI to generate images. The feature went viral at launch when people used it to blend multiple photos together to create personal digitized figurines. By the end of the following month, the Gemini app surpassed 5 billion images and dethroned OpenAI's ChatGPT at the top of Apple's App Store. Google's AI talent pool deepened over the summer, when the company announced an agreement to bring in Varun Mohan, co-founder and CEO of AI coding startup Windsurf, along with other senior research and development employees from the high-profile startup that had previously been in talks with OpenAI for a $3 billion acquisition. That deal fell apart, and Google ended up agreeing to pay $2.4 billion in licensing fees and for compensation to snag Windsurf's top engineers. Winning in AI and in courtSoon thereafter, Google was handed a gift in the courtroom.Despite losing its antitrust case last year, as Google was found to hold an illegal monopoly in internet search, U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta ruled in September against the most severe consequences that were proposed by the Justice Department. Google would not have to divest Chrome and could still make payments to companies to preload products, meaning it could continue paying Apple billions of dollars to be the default search engine on iPhones. One consequence of the ruling is that Google would have to share certain data with competitors. Gemini's momentum has been the biggest story.Last month, Google announced Gemini 3, an upgraded AI model, almost eight months after rolling out Gemini 2.5.While Gemini still trails ChatGPT in overall usage, it's been rapidly making up ground. According to data this month from Similarweb, ChatGPT's share of generative AI traffic dropped to about 68% from 87% a year earlier, while Gemini jumped to roughly 18% from about 5% over that stretch. watch nowAnalysts at Citizens wrote in a Tuesday report that the critical development for Alphabet isn't just about Gemini but the effect of the company's AI investments on the core search business. AI Overviews is Google's search-embedded service that provides AI-powered summaries for user queries. The Citizens analysts said the \"incorporation of updated models is improving the relevance of answers, which we view as a further tailwind to engagement.\"\"We come away believing Google can further accelerate search revenue in 4Q25, which we view as the key question near term,\" wrote the analysts, who recommend buying the shares even after the latest rally. Analysts have also highlighted Google's broad strength in cloud computing, where it's chasing Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure, and the company's leadership in robotaxis through Waymo as potential catalysts heading into 2026. Still, with investors piling into the stock, expectations are sky-high. Analysts project fourth-quarter revenue growth of 15% to over $111 billion when Alphabet next reports results, according to LSEG, and growth throughout next year is expected to be in the low teens.In October, Alphabet raised its capital spending forecast for 2025 to as high as $93 billion, up from $85 billion. Analysts see that number jumping to more than $114 billion in 2026, according to FactSet. CEO Sundar Pichai has repeatedly said the company is responding to soaring demand. He said on the October earnings call that Google's cloud business signed more deals over $1 billion in 2025 through the third quarter than in the two prior years combined. Analysts at Pivotal Research warned in a note to clients earlier this month that should OpenAI, one of Google's key customers, cut its spending or face other issues due to its mounting obligations, \"it is likely to temporarily get pretty ugly for AI stocks and the market in general.\"But the Pivotal analysts have a buy rating on the stock and raised their price target by $50, to $400, about 28% above Wednesday's closing price of $313.\"We believe the shakeout, if it happens, will mirror 2000 and will inevitably be a healthy weeding out process leaving fewer much more dominant competitors, with GOOG leading the way,\" they wrote. — CNBC's Jennifer Elias contributed to this report.

    "body": "watch nowThe big artificial intelligence bubble question has been the tech industry's buzziest debate all year, and one robot has weighed in with its opinion.KOID is a short, slender humanoid robot with a black metal body and a bright ring of light for a face. KOID is manufactured by Unitree, one of China's hottest tech companies, and the Nvidia-powered robot shares a name with an ETF launched in June by KraneShares that focuses on robotics companies.The walking, talking machine on Tuesday told CNBC that the AI bubble debate is certainly a \"hot topic,\" but KOID gave a neutral outlook on whether the boom is actually a looming bubble.\"We might see a lot of excitement around AI right now, but whether it's a bubble or just a transformative wave, is something only time will tell,\" KOID said.The AI-powered machine added that AI and humanoids are \"here to stay\" and will continue to evolve.Weighing in at about 77 pounds, KOID is one of Unitree's G1 models. Those humanoids have 23 degrees of freedom, or specific points where it can move independently, enabling it to achieve full-body maneuvers from dancing to boxing. KOID is available to purchase on RoboStore, the largest U.S. distributor of Unitree robots, with the models ranging from $8,990 to $128,900.A humanoid robot from RoboStore joins CNBC's \"Power Lunch\" on Dec. 30, 2025.CNBCRoboStore CEO Teddy Haggerty told CNBC's \"Power Lunch\" on Tuesday that while KOID can be programmed to do many kinds of tasks, the industry is still in a \"prototyping\" stage of figuring out where robots fit in everyday living.\"What is it that we really want robots to do?\" Haggerty said. \"Do we want robots to become our new housekeepers? Do we want them to help manufacturing? Do we want them to replace jobs?\"KOID, however, seems a little more certain of its own future. It said that robots will likely become \"even more versatile and integrated\" into daily life.\"They'll help out a variety of fields, from home assistants to industrial tasks, making life a bit easier and more efficient,\" the robot said.The humanoid robotics race has been heating up this past year, with companies including Boston Dynamics and Agility Robotics emerging in the space. Tesla's Optimus robots have taken center stage, with CEO Elon Musk saying that they are a future key contributor to the company's valuation.Yet while Optimus robots have yet to hit the market, Chinese companies have been ramping up production to beat the U.S. to the punch — with Unitree spearheading the pack.The company outperformed its peers in events like the World Robot Conference and World Humanoid Robot Games. Unitree, which is heading for an initial public offering that could value it at up to $7 billion, debuted its latest H2 model earlier this year.Read more CNBC tech newsElon Musk envisions humanoid robots everywhere.

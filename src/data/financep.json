    "body": "With just a few trading days left this year, 2025 looks to have been another hot year for stocks. The S&P 500 has returned more than 19% since Jan. 1 as of market close on Monday. Barring a year-end disaster, it will mark the third consecutive year of double-digit returns for investors in the broad U.S. stock market. Of course, past performance is no guarantee of future results, and financial pros generally caution against making wholesale changes to your strategy based on short-term stock market prognostications. But if you're invested in the broad stock market, many investment analysts believe that 2026 has the potential to be another great year for your portfolio. \"Certainly we're at a point where we've had incredibly strong performance from U.S. equity markets over the last three years. We don't think that that means that we can't have another good year next year,\" says Kristy Akullian, head of iShares investment strategy for the Americas at BlackRock. \"We are still pretty optimistic in terms of our outlook for U.S. equities. We're pretty upbeat, relatively bullish.\"Wall Street expects corporate earnings to continue to rapidly grow in 2026. On average, analysts expect companies in the S&P 500 to boost earnings by 15.5% next year, up from an estimated 13.2% in 2025 and 12.1% in 2024, according to data analytics firm LSEG. Additionally, the U.S. and global economy appear to be on healthy footing. Analysts at Goldman Sachs expect 2.6% U.S. gross domestic product growth in 2026 and a 2.8% growth in the global economy. That's slightly higher than consensus estimates, but generally, any positive momentum for the economy next year is probably a good sign for stocks, says Ryan Detrick, chief market strategist at The Carson Group. \"We simply don't see a recession next year,\" he says. \"And when you don't have a recession, the S&P 500 is up double-digits almost 70% of the time.\"Indeed, since 1950, the S&P 500 has posted calendar-year returns of 10% or more 68% of the time and a positive return 86% of the time, according to the Carson Group. Overall, Detrick expects the S&P 500 to record gains of 12% to 15% in 2026. What market projections mean for your portfolio in 2026A huge factor that market prognosticators are baking into their assumptions is continued spending on and adoption of artificial intelligence technology. \"The ongoing wave of AI-driven physical investment is expected to be a powerful force, reminiscent of past periods of major capital expansion such as the development of railroads in the mid-19th century and the late-1990s information and telecommunications surge,\" Vanguard analysts wrote in their 2026 outlook. When markets are expecting a serious paradigm shift, you always run the risk of a pullback should progress stall, says Jeffrey Buchbinder, chief equity strategist at LPL Financial. \"We would argue that AI disappointment is the No. 1 risk market in 2026,\" he says. \"That could take several forms. It could come from doubts that money will be there to pay for all this or concerns that it will not translate into data center construction that the market seems to be counting on.\"Buchbinder says he could see an AI-related pullback rankling markets in 2026. Even with that risk in mind, he and others believe that continued AI adoption — and the productivity it may bring — should drive the economy and stock market upward in the coming year. Based on LPL's 2026 \"fair value\" estimate for the S&P 500, analysts at the firm believe stocks could rise 5.7% to 7.2% from current levels next year. Analysts don't expect AI to do all of the heavy lifting in the stock market. Even non-AI stocks should benefit from more business-friendly tax laws and a Federal Reserve that's willing to continue slashing interest rates next year, says Akullian. \"I would characterize our U.S. equity outlook as AI optimism paired with sensible diversification,\" she says. Rather than trying to figure out where the winners will be or timing the market, you'd be wise to invest consistently, and across a variety of assets, Akullian says. And in a year where the global economy could be picking up steam, it may make sense to add some international exposure if your portfolio is heavily tilted toward U.S. stocks, she says. \"Nearly every investor that we speak to could probably benefit from adding some international allocations,\" she says. No matter how optimistic you are about the economy, you should always be prepared for some volatility,  says Detrick.He recommends talking with a financial advisor before making any moves in your portfolio. Even if you're managing your own investments, it's important to have a plan for the market's inevitable downturns.\"As we head into next year, just remember that markets go up and they go down. There are going to be bad days. There are going to be scary headlines,\" he says. \"At some point during this year, if stocks are down between 10% to 15%, that would be perfectly logical and normal. And if you're planning ahead of time for it, you probably won't make rash decisions with your investments.\"Want to give your kids the ultimate advantage? Sign up for CNBC's new online course, How to Raise Financially Smart Kids.

    "body": "As middle management jobs shrink, workplace experts say executives may be underestimating just how crucial these roles are to their companies — especially in the age of AI.The ranks of middle managers, the professionals that bridge senior leaders with frontline employees, have been thinning in recent years. Middle managers made up one-third of all layoffs in 2023, a Bloomberg and Live Data Technologies analysis found. This year, 41% of employees say their companies trimmed down their management layers, according to organizational consulting firm Korn Ferry's Workforce 2025: Power Shifts report, which surveyed 15,000 professionals worldwide. The trend is expected to continue into 2026: One in five (20%) businesses are expected to use AI to flatten their organizational structure, slashing over half of current middle management positions, an October 2024 report from research and advisory firm Gartner found. The layoffs span from major public companies like Amazon and Google to smaller businesses in the U.S., particularly in industries like tech and retail. Some of these companies say they're rectifying pandemic-era over-hiring. Others say they've laid off middle managers as they seek faster, more efficient workflows, and still others cite downsizing due to economic pressures, according to a recent Harris Poll survey on behalf of staffing agency Express Employment Professionals. And while the timing may be coincidental, the tightening comes as some CEOs mandate using artificial intelligence to accomplish work tasks before requesting more headcount.While there can be some upsides to trimming layers of ineffective management, leadership and management experts warn against cutting too deep. They say these positions are a necessary puzzle piece for a successful workplace.\"Middle managers are more important than ever,\" says Deborah Lovich, a C-suite advisor and senior partner at Boston Consulting Group who has counseled leaders on how to improve the employee experience for over 30 years. In today's rapidly changing and uncertain economy where employees are experiencing increased burnout and dissatisfaction and lower confidence, Lovich says middle managers are the ones who can give them the motivation and reassurance they need to be productive. Well-equipped managers aren't just an 'expense'Amid higher inflation, tariffs and economic concerns, many companies are tightening their belts. Middle managers, who typically have higher salaries, can often be the first target in leaner times.To be sure, there can be benefits to thinning out excessive layers of hierarchy.Cutting back on middle managers can help businesses reduce costs, encourage more collaboration between frontline employees and senior executives, and increase a company's overall speed and efficiency, according to a 2020 report from management consulting firm McKinsey & Company.That doesn't mean middle management roles should be eliminated altogether or indiscriminately, says Megg Withinton, vice president of enterprise analytics at HR solutions company Insperity. Instead, she says, these professionals should be better equipped to do their jobs. A competent middle manager builds motivation and productivity for their team and plays a significant role in company culture, says Lovich.In contrast, ineffective middle managers — whether due to inexperience, poor job fit, vague guidance from their own bosses or another reason — can weaken performance and morale. Only 51% of newer managers with less than three years of experience feel completely prepared to lead others, according to Insperity's data. And only 20% of employees say their managers exceed their expectations, according to a recent Insperity survey of 1,000 U.S. executives, managers and frontline employees.One potential solution, suggests Withinton: Companies could invest in management training and upskilling, rather than using layoffs as a short-term fix. Upskilling isn't free, of course. But spending about $1,000 per employee to train and develop your talent may have better long-term outcomes, Withinton says, considering turnover costs and lost employee trust and morale — especially for companies that eventually rehire after layoffs anyway. Besides, effective management is about more than money, says Withinton. Some workers find that their work is more difficult when their immediate manager is cut. In Korn Ferry's report, 37% of survey respondents said that not having that middle management role left them feeling directionless.\"I would really encourage people to think about managers not as an expense or an administrative or bureaucratic layer, but an agent for change,\" she says. As organizations rethink their strategies and workflow to be more AI-forward, managers can help guide their teams to use the technology effectively, instead of fear it. \"[Especially] in a time where things are changing week to week, and we're all just going to be scrambling to keep up for a while as this new [AI-driven] world unfolds.\"How to use managers to their full potentialManagers provide the most value when they're keeping their teams accountable and helping workers feel motivated and supported, says Lovich — not necessarily when they're handling administrative tasks like coordinating meetings or tracking employees.The emotional element of management is particularly important in the age of AI, she notes. The tech can and should be used to augment managers' abilities to complete administrative tasks, but can't authentically congratulate an employee on a job well done or notice that they're a little down and not themselves on a given day, Lovich says.Manager training should emphasize skills like fostering interpersonal relationships, effective communication, decision making and accountability, conflict resolution and building trust within teams, according to Insperity performance consultant Chris Brennan.Organizations that use their managers to their full potential reap significant benefits, Insperity's survey found: Their employees are five times more likely to report a healthy workplace culture and four times more likely to understand and align with company goals. What's more, companies with high-performing managers tend to yield higher shareholder returns than their counterparts, according to a June 2023 report from McKinsey and Company. Those advantages will be especially important as organizations start to integrate artificial intelligence into their workflows, Withinton says.\"Before we all leap to 'AI is going to make the role of manager either obsolete or much more reduced,' you actually have to deploy AI and make it work for your company,\" Withinton says. \"And the managers are the people who are going to be able to really make sure that it's being used in the appropriate way day to day. There is no other way around that.\"Still, a looming question remains: By helping facilitate the transition to AI, are today's managers positioning themselves to be increasingly obsolete tomorrow?

    "body": "Mary Barra, CEO of General Motors, attends the annual Allen and Co. Sun Valley Media and Technology Conference at the Sun Valley Resort in Sun Valley, Idaho, on July 8, 2025.David A. Grogan | CNBCDETROIT — General Motors is on pace to be the top U.S.-traded automaker stock of 2025, as shares of GM are having their best year since the Detroit company's reemergence from bankruptcy in 2009.GM stock is up over 55% to a record of more than $80 per share, as of Friday's close, topping the company's previous annual increase of 48.3% last year. That includes a nearly 13% rise so far in December, adding to five consecutive months of share gains, according to FactSet.Several factors have been driving the share increase. But GM CEO Mary Barra and other executives have contended for years that the automaker's stock has been significantly undervalued given its consistent earnings performance.\"Great vehicles, innovative technology, a rewarding customer experience, along with strong financial results, will continue to set GM apart in an increasingly competitive landscape,\" Barra said during the company's last quarterly earnings call in October.Amid the stock's run-up, Barra has significantly cut her position in the company. She has exercised options or sold roughly 1.8 million shares this year, valued at more than $73 million, according to public filings confirmed by GM. As of the last public filing in September, Barra still owned more than 433,500 shares valued at over $35 million, with much of her annual awards granted in options and stock.GM's stock performance compares with a 17% yearly increase for Tesla as of Friday's close, a 34% jump for Ford Motor and a 15% loss for Chrysler parent Stellantis. Other U.S.-traded automakers such as Honda Motor and Toyota Motor have had smaller annual gains.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconAuto stocksGM 's most recent quarterly earnings were a major catalyst for Wall Street analyst bullishness that led to reratings and price target increases after the third quarter.The automaker's quarterly adjusted earnings per share have topped Wall Street estimates every quarter except the second quarter of 2022 over the past five years, according to average expectations of analysts compiled by FactSet. Wall Street analysts overall have cited GM's cash generation, earnings resilience and track record in delivering shareholder returns, including stock buybacks, as reasons for their optimism. The automaker also is expected to greatly benefit from regulation changes under the Trump administration, despite ongoing tariffs. UBS recently increased its 12-month price target on GM stock by 14% to $97 per share, while naming the company its top autos pick heading into 2026. Morgan Stanley earlier this month also upgraded GM to overweight, with a $90 per share price target.\"In our view, General Motors leads the D3 in the North America and Global market with steady unit sales growth, [average transaction price] growth, disciplined incentive spend, and inventory management. This has resulted in better [earnings before interest and taxes] margin and return metrics than peers,\" Morgan Stanley analyst Andrew Percoco said in a Dec. 7 investor note.Read moreGM stock has cumulatively been in the black on a weekly basis since June. The largest weekly gain of 19.3% occurred when the automaker reported its third-quarter earnings on Oct. 21. Those results beat Wall Street's expectations and the company raised its annual guidance, adding that next year's earnings are expected to be better than 2025's.GM stock's has also seen a boost from some external factors. The Trump administration has loosened U.S. fuel economy and emissions standards, removed related penalties that were imposed under the Biden administration, and renegotiated its trade deal with South Korea, a major manufacturing hub for GM. Meanwhile, the industry has been seeing a slowdown in less profitable EV sales.\"GM is effectively a regional (NA) [automaker] and we believe they are well positioned to benefit from the relaxed US regulatory environment (emissions and fuel economy),\" UBS analyst Joseph Spak said in a Dec. 15 investor note raising the per share price.GM CFO Paul Jacobson earlier this month said the company will continue stock buybacks.\"As long as the stock remains as undervalued as it is, the priority is to buy back shares. And I think you'll continue to see that from us going forward,\" he said during a UBS investor conference.GM is rated overweight with an $80.86 target price, according to analyst averages compiled by FactSet.— CNBC's Michael Bloom contributed to this report.Correction: Lucid shares are down for the year.

Iranian military sites and weapons programs were damaged earlier this year by attacks carried out by Israel and the U.S.Trump, ahead of a meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida on Monday, also said he would support Israeli strikes on Iran in the event of rearmament.\"The response of the Islamic Republic of Iran to any oppressive aggression will be harsh and regrettable,\" Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian posted to X on Tuesday.Trump has also taken an aggressive stance toward Venezuela of late, targeting alleged drug boats, ordering a complete blockade of sanctioned oil tankers moving in and out of the country, and designating the country's government a \"foreign terrorist organization.\"Earlier this month, the Trump administration said the U.S. had seized an oil tanker off the coast of Venezuela. The seized tanker had been sanctioned by the U.S. for years and transported oil from Iran and Venezuela, according to a post from Attorney General Pam Bondi.And at the meeting on Monday with Netanyahu, Trump also confirmed an attack on an alleged drug loading facility on Venezuelan soil. CNN reported that the attack was carried out earlier this month by the CIA. Tuesday's sanctions follow similar efforts in October and November to target individuals and entities operating in or involved with Iranian weapons networks.\"Treasury is holding Iran and Venezuela accountable for their aggressive and reckless proliferation of deadly weapons around the world,\" John K. Hurley, Treasury Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence, said in a statement.\"We will continue to take swift action to deprive those who enable Iran's military-industrial complex access to the U.S. financial system,\" he said.",

However, he urged the country to negotiate.\"Now, I hear that Iran is trying to build up again, and if they are we're going to have to knock them down. We'll knock them down. We'll knock the hell out of them. But hopefully that's not happening,\" Trump said, standing beside Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\"I heard Iran wants to make a deal. If they want to make a deal that's much smarter,\" the president continued.Trump gaggled with reporters at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida ahead of a meeting there with Netanyahu, which comes at a fraught time for the Middle East and amid heightened tensions between Israel and Iran. NBC News reported earlier this month that Netanyahu and Israeli officials were becoming more concerned that Iran was attempting to ramp up its ballistic missile production — which had been damaged earlier this year by Israeli strikes — and reconstitute the nuclear enrichment sites the U.S. bombed in June.\"If they will continue with the missiles, yes.

The first phase of the agreement took effect in October and has mostly held. But a second phase — which would call on Hamas to disarm and require Israeli military forces to withdraw — has proven more challenging. Netanyahu has said the second phase cannot begin until Hamas returns the remains of the final deceased Israeli hostage. Trump said on Monday that he hopes to proceed to the second phase \"as quickly as we can. But there has to be a disarmament ... we have to disarm with Hamas.\"Foreign policy in focusForeign policy has dominated Trump's schedule of late. On Sunday, he hosted Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at Mar-a-Lago. The Trump administration is facilitating negotiations between Ukraine and Russia to try to bring an end to the multiyear conflict between the two nations. During the meeting, Zelenskyy reportedly had asked the U.S. for security guarantees for up to 50 years for Ukraine, though the current 20-point peace plan outlined guarantees for 15 years.Trump also said he had a \"very productive\" call with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Monday, though he said a few \"thorny issues\" stand in the way of ending the war.\"We have a couple of issues that we're going to get resolved, hopefully, and if we get it resolved, you're going to have peace,\" Trump said.In the short, wide-ranging press conference on Monday, Trump offered updates on his monthslong pressure campaign against Venezuela.The president confirmed a U.S. strike on a drug loading facility in Venezuela, marking an escalation in his campaign against Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro. \"There was a major explosion in the dock area where they load the boats up with drugs .... So we hit all the boats, and now we hit the area,\" Trump said. \"It's the implementation area, that's where they implement, and that is no longer around.\"Trump has recently designated the Venezuelan government a \"foreign terrorist organization,\" ordered a complete blockade on sanctioned oil tankers moving in and out of the country and has been targeting alleged Venezuelan drug boats.",

(Photo by Tang Yanjun/China News Service/VCG via Getty Images)Tang Yanjun | China News Service | China News Service | Getty ImagesBillionaire Elon Musk has put humanoid robots in the spotlight this year, positioning them as central to Tesla's valuation, which he thinks could hit tens of trillions of dollars. But Tesla is yet to sell its flagship humanoid robot Optimus.Instead, it's likely a slew of Chinese companies that will beat Tesla to the punch and begin ramping up production of robots in 2026, as Beijing puts the technology at the center of its strategic plans. \"China currently leads the United States in the early commercialization of humanoid robots,\" Andreas Brauchle, partner at consultancy Horváth, told CNBC by email. \"While both countries are expected to build similarly large markets over time, China is scaling more rapidly in this initial phase.\"Humanoid robots are designed to be shaped and move like a human. Artificial intelligence algorithms power their abilities along with complex hardware like semiconductors. Proponents say they could be used across various settings, from factories to hospitality and even in the home.Beijing makes robots a key priority Over the past few years, China has made robotics a key focus of its tech strategy, unveiling plans to create supply chains and mass production of the machines. Chinese President Xi Jinping and the country's top leaders, known as the Central Committee, met in October and released proposals for the \"15th five-year plan,\" a document that lays out some of the key focus areas for Beijing in the coming years. \"Embodied artificial intelligence,\" a term that refers to AI-driven hardware like robotics or driverless cars, was mentioned in the text.For China, humanoid robots represent an opportunity to address labor challenges in the world's second-largest economy as well as advancing Beijing's quest for tech supremacy.\"China's push into humanoid robotics development is driven by a combination of addressing demographic pressures, driving the next horizon of economic growth, and strengthening its role in global competition,\" Karel Eloot, senior partner at McKinsey & Company, told CNBC.watch nowChina's birth rates are declining and the population is aging, leading to a reduced number of people in the workforce and rising labor costs. Robots are seen as a way to address this. Meanwhile, China is locked in an ongoing tech race with the U.S. across multiple sectors. Robotics, seen as a real-world application of AI, could become a new battleground in 2026. Politico reported this month that Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick has been meeting with the CEOs of robotics companies to form a plan to accelerate the industry. Washington is considering issuing an executive order on robotics next year, Politico reported, citing people familiar with the matter.China's key robotics companies\"China could be the most important market for humanoids,\" RBC Capital Markets said in a note this month. Analysts at the bank forecast a global total addressable market for humanoids of $9 trillion by 2050, with China accounting for more than 60% of that. Chinese robotics firms are attempting to power ahead with mass production. Unitree, which is gearing up for an initial public offering that could value it at around $7 billion, is one of China's buzziest robotics players. The company has various robotics models, including humanoids. This year, it debuted its latest model, the H2, showcasing its ability to dance. Unitree robot performs for visitors at China Summit in pavilion 1 during Web Summit first day of this year's event on November 11, 2025 in Lisbon, Portugal.Horacio Villalobos | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesUBTech Robotics is another of China's key players. It makes humanoid robots for both an industrial setting, like a factory, as well as commercial applications, like being a tour guide. UBTech's flagship industrial model, the Walker S2, is able to swap out its battery itself in order to run 24 hours a day. The company is listed on the Hong Kong stock exchange and this month carried out a share placement to raise around $400 million to fund its expansion. UBTech plans to deliver 500 industrial robots this year and ramp up production of its humanoid robots to 5,000 in 2026 and 10,000 in 2027, the South China Morning Post reported in November.AgiBot is another player that said this month its 5,000th humanoid robot rolled off the production line.Xpeng displayed its humanoid robot called \"Iron\" at the IAA auto show in Munich, Germany on September 8, 2025.Arjun Kharpal | CNBCChina vs U.S. advantagesChina's manufacturing prowess and success in ramping up production in other products like electric vehicles, may give it an edge when it comes to robotics, analysts said.\"The depth of China's supply chain means companies can develop and manufacture robots at a significant cost advantage compared to other regions,\" Ethan Qi, associate director at Counterpoint Research, told CNBC.Indeed, UBTech expects production costs to drop 20% to 30% each year. Meanwhile, various local governments in China have subsidy programs aimed at companies in the robotics sector. The U.S. however, has \"advantages in AI, autonomy and advanced algorithmic development,\" Horváth's Brauchle said. watch nowAmerican firms are \"betting on vertical integration\" — which means owning and controlling more of the supply chain — according to McKinsey's Eloot. This includes components like actuators, which power a robot's movement, as well as the AI software that is integrated into the final product.\"The belief is that tighter ownership of the full system will deliver superior performance, stronger safety cases, and defensible intellectual property,\" Eloot said.China's humanoid robot market will initially be bigger than that of the U.S., but will not remain that way forever.\"Over the long term, both countries are expected to converge toward similarly large markets, whereby absolute mass-market penetration is expected after 2040, driven primarily by high-volume adoption in private households,\" Brauchle said.BottlenecksChina's robotics industry is not without its challenges. One bottleneck is its restricted access to certain chips required for robots. \"I think there's a very high reliance on U.S. chips, for example, Nvidia chips,\" Jacqueline Du, head of China industrial tech research at Goldman Sachs, told CNBC's \"The China Connection\" last month. Charlie Dai, principal analyst at Forrester, noted a number of other potential hurdles, such as AI limitations in unpredictable operating conditions for humanoids and regulatory barriers.\"Together, these challenges slow commercialization over the next two years and require coordinated innovation, security, and policy frameworks,\" Dai told CNBC.There are also the technological difficulties of replicating the human movement of limbs like hands and fingers — an incredibly complex task that demands capable of mimicking biological functions. \"Most robotic hands fall well short in effective degrees of freedom, sharply limiting their range,\" McKinsey's Eloot notes.Finally, perhaps the biggest challenge is bringing the cost of these complex machines down. Eloot said that product costs for today's advanced humanoid prototypes range from $150,000 to $500,000 per unit. Those need to come down to between $20,000 to $50,000 per unit to \"compete with human labor.\"Beijing's investment bubble concernsEven though robotics is a strategic priority for China, this hasn't stopped regulators from warning about a potentially overheated market.In November, China's top economic planning agency, the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), warned there is a risk of a bubble forming in the humanoid robotic market. The NDRC said that there are more than 150 humanoid robotics companies in China, with that number growing, and many of them are bringing out similar products.In the past, there have been boom and bust cycles around technology that Beijing has given strategic importance, such as electric vehicles.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconAn ETF that tracks Chinese robotics firms rose in 2025. \"Many assume that humanoid robots will soon exceed human-level versatility, speed and autonomy. Manufacturers reinforce this perception through polished demonstration videos and staged trade-show performances that present capabilities not yet reproducible in real industrial environments,\" Horváth's Brauchle said.\"This gap between perception and reality increases the risk of an investment bubble.\"\"A market correction could slow innovation and commercialization momentum,\" Forrester's Dai added.",

(Photo by Steve Christo - Corbis/Corbis via Getty Images)Steve Christo - Corbis | Corbis News | Getty ImagesNovo Nordisk has had a difficult year: a tumbling stock price resulting in the biggest leadership shakeup in the company's 100-year history as investors turned their back on the Danish drugmaker and its weight loss business. It seemed investors had largely given up on Novo's ability to translate its strides in pioneering GLP-1 drugs to financial gains as the lucrative market attracts new players. Scientists, however, say that the medicine still has potential.What started with a focus on the drug's ability to manage weight and blood sugar, and combat related conditions such as heart disease, is now expanding further with growing interest in how it might also impact the brain.Semaglutide, or as it is better known, Ozempic and Wegovy, is a GLP-1 receptor agonist that was originally developed for diabetes patients to manage their blood sugar levels. However, it quickly became prescribed by doctors off-label en masse as its appetite surpressing and weight-loss properties became known. Today, it is approved for anti-obesity purposes and brings in billions annually for its maker, Novo Nordisk.Now, the medical community is discovering a growing list of added benefits from these drugs.\"Wegovy promotes weight loss and potentially other mechanisms not fully understood,\" the U.S. Food and Drug Administration wrote in a statement in August when it approved the drug for treating liver disease. Semaglutide is also cleared by regulators to reduce the risk of heart attacks and strokes in overweight people with cardiovascular disease, as well as to treat chronic kidney disease in diabetes patients. Meanwhile, a rival drug by U.S. competitor Eli Lilly, tirzepatide (known as Mounjaro and Zepbound), which also targets the GLP-1 hormone as well as another gut hormone called GIP, is approved for treating moderate to severe obstructive sleep apnea in adults with obesity.But the benefits may not end there. Amid increased competition, additional indications have become a new frontier for drug developers alongside new formats like pills.GLP-1s and the brainObservational studies have shown that GLP-1s appear to quiet cravings not just for food, but also for alcohol, tobacco, and recreational drugs, as they affect the brain's reward pathway. By seemingly changing dopamine signals in the brain, these drugs could reduce cravings and allow the individual to be more rational when faced with tempting options.\"There is interest in understanding the potential of semaglutide on various brain functions,\" Laura Nisenbaum, executive director at Alzheimer's Drug Discovery Foundation (ADDF), told CNBC.\"Understanding that inflammation and energy usage in the brain is going to be so important for our normal cognitive function,\" Nisenbaum said. Recognizing that link will be useful in many different neurological and neuropsychiatric indications where changes or damage to the brain impact mood, behavior or cognition, she added.Read moreEvolving data suggest that semaglutide and rival drug tirzepatide made by Eli Lilly might be the first effective \"anticonsumption\" agents with the potential to treat excessive food cravings, obesity, alcohol consumption, nicotine addiction, recreational drug use, and even uncontrollable shopping behaviors, a study by researchers at Saint Luke's Mid America Heart Institute and University of Missouri found.  Another small-scale randomized clinical trial found that low-dose semaglutide reduced alcohol consumption and significantly reduced cravings compared to placebo in patients with alcohol use disorder over nine weeks of treatment. The results justify larger clinical trials of incretin therapies for alcohol use disorder, the researchers concluded.The Alzheimer's disappointment that wasn'tAnother potential added benefit of this class of drugs could be how it interacts with the dementia process.In November, Novo disappointed investors when it published data on a two-year-long clinical trial testing whether semaglutide could slow down cognitive decline in patients with Alzheimer's disease. Hopes had run high that the medicine might be able to help people suffering from the most common type of dementia, as it had been observed in real-world studies that diabetes patients taking semaglutide developed Alzheimer's at a lower rate than those who didn't.But the late-stage trial failed to meet its main goal, showing that semaglutide didn't significantly impact cognition in Alzheimer's patients. Novo said it would discontinue a one-year extension of the trial due to the results. However, some scientists told CNBC it shouldn't be seen as a failure. They say that even if the results were disappointing, it was a well-conducted trial that the science community was able to learn from.watch now\"It just gave a negative result as far as the drug is concerned in that particular population,\" said Ivan Koychev, associate professor in neuropsychiatry at Imperial College London. Semaglutide however, affects Alzheimer's disease proteins in the right direction, as seen in biomarker measures, Koychev said. \"They're impacting Alzheimer's disease-linked proteins, they reduce their quantity in the cerebrospinal fluid, which suggests that it is interacting directly with the alternative pathology.\"There was also an observed reduction in systemic inflammation biomarkers, according to Novo. \"The thinking is that it may be this anti-inflammatory effect that, if it is implemented early enough in the disease process, you can substantially modify the risk of dementia,\" Koychev said.\"The signal was always in the prevention space rather than the treatment space,\" he added.Similarly, Nisenbaum said a next useful step would be to test semaglutide and other GLP-1s earlier in the course of the disease as a preventative therapy. Novo Nordisk said it was reviewing all data from the trial, but that it was too early to speculate any further on the effect semaglutide might have on dementia patients. The science versus the StreetDespite the fact that the innovations developed by Novo have the potential to significantly impact public health, many investors have turned their back on the company over the past 18 months as its growth prospects face challenges.Novo shares are having their worst year on record since listing on Nasdaq Copenhagen over three decades ago. At its peak in mid-2024, the stock traded at above 1,000 Danish kroner. Today, it trades at around 320 kroner.The stock's year-to-date drop of 50% is being driven by increased competition from U.S. rival Eli Lilly and so-called compounding pharmacies making cheaper, copycat versions of semaglutide. A failure to convince investors that its pipeline will bring significant financial gains amid a flurry of hopeful market entrants also adds to the pressure.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconNovo Nordisk shares in the year-to-dateThe Alzheimer's trial data readout in November led shares to drop 5.8% on the day, despite analysts saying it was always a long shot and Novo management themselves called it a \"lottery ticket,\" — underlining its highly uncertain outcome.The two Alzheimer's drugs currently on the market, Eli Lilly's Kisunla and Biogen/Eisai's Leqembi have been shown to slow down the progression of Alzheimer's disease by up to a third but come with the risk of severe side effects. These medicines were studied 15 years ago, and there were many negative studies along the way, ADDF's Nisenbaum said. \"Each one, we learned something that then led to an improvement in understanding our patients in the clinical trials and then how to measure what's happening in them.\"\"It's absolutely about the long game,\" she added, hopeful that semaglutide or other novel drugs that target risk factors could be used in combination with Kisunla and Leqembi.But the market doesn't see it like that, and there are many reasons why.First of all, investors' time horizons are much shorter than the decades-long process it typically takes to bring a drug to market, meaning pharmaceutical development often clashes with the speedier pace of public markets. Adding new indicators for a drug also takes time, as they need to be backed up by often lengthy clinical trials.watch nowSecondly, semaglutide is facing key patent expiries in 2031 and 2032, which will give the green light to others to make generic versions of semaglutide.\"We don't see a good argument for a valuation floor,\" Jefferies analysts said late November, noting that Novo now enters the 5-year patent expiry window with no real moat.\"Lower U.S. prices may stimulate additional volume demand and enhance patient retention, but we are not of the view that, at these prices, generics and compounders cannot compete,\" they added, rating shares at Underperform.Pressure from the Trump administration to lower drug prices for Americans, and the threat of high import taxes, have served as additional headwinds for Novo, as well as for many of its pharma peers over the past year.Goldman Sachs analysts, led by James Quigley, are slightly more optimistic. \"We remain Buy-rated on Novo Nordisk, as while expectations have reset sharply downwards for near/medium-term estimates, we continue to believe there could be some volume opportunity for Novo as the obesity market evolves,\" they wrote in a note late November.\"While Novo are unlikely to take a leading share, we still see opportunities for Wegovy, CagriSema and oral Wegovy to drive value in excess of what the market currently believes, although we acknowledge that this will likely take time and evidence of an uptick in scripts before investors give credit,\" they added.",

    "body": "Two Xiaomi electric car models in different colors are pictured here on Nov. 2, 2025.Sopa Images | Lightrocket | Getty ImagesBEIJING — China's electric car boom is ending in 2025 on a soft note, with sales dipping and analysts warning that a fierce price war is likely to persist.Not only did Tesla see its sales drop by 7.4% from a year ago, but market leader BYD also reported a 5.1% decline, according to data from the China Passenger Car Association covering January through November. BYD's passenger car sales in November alone fell by an even steeper 26.5% from a year ago, while newer rivals, including vehicles powered by Huawei software and models from Xiaomi, recorded sales growth of more than 90% during the same period.The early trio of U.S.-listed Chinese electric car startups — Nio, Xpeng and Li Auto — failed to make the top 10 sellers for the month, despite improvements in monthly deliveries.Market concentration has increased sharply. The top ten manufacturers now account for around 95% of the Chinese new energy vehicle market — up sharply from around 60% to 70% just two or three years ago, according to Xiao Feng, co-head of China Industrial Research at Citic CLSA. New energy vehicles include battery-electric and hybrid-powered cars.\"I think there will be further industry consolidation even though prices matter more than specific brands,\" he said. \"Obviously buyers will not buy a car they [have] never heard of.\"watch nowThe scale of price cuts highlights the pressure. Autohome, an online platform for car sales data in China, even lists vehicles by discount percentage, such as a 432,000 yuan ($61,660) drop for the Mercedes-Benz EQS EV or a 147,000 yuan reduction in the Volvo XC70.Paul Gong, head of China autos research at UBS, expects the price war to keep going \"for years,\" while domestic policy changes will likely weigh on growth next year.Beijing is set to re-impose a purchase tax while scaling back trade-in purchase subsidies, he said. UBS predicts the growth rate of China's electric car sales to roughly halve next year from around 20% in 2025.The market is already saturated, with new energy vehicles accounting for 59.4% of new passenger cars sold in China in November, according to the China Passenger Car Association.Overseas expansionSlowing demand at home is pushing Chinese electric carmakers to expand aggressively overseas, where profit margins are often higher.In the first half of the year, Hangzhou-based Geely said its electric car exports quadrupled, helping bring overall vehicle exports to 184,000. The company entered Australia, Vietnam and four other markets during that time, extending its reach to around 90 countries. The automaker has also launched factories in Egypt, the Middle East and Indonesia.Geely ranks second to BYD in China's new energy vehicle sales.BYD is also expanding its overseas production, including a new factory in Hungary slated to ramp up manufacturing in 2026. The company exported more than 131,000 cars in November alone.Tu Le, founder and managing director at consulting firm Sino Auto Insights, expects more Chinese car manufacturers and battery companies to \"firmly stake their claims in Europe,\" bringing competition closer to the U.S. and Tesla.Foreign automakers Other foreign car companies are still keen on taking a slice of the China market.German auto giant Volkswagen has forged local joint ventures with Xpeng and Chinese automotive chips designer Horizon Robotics. Volkswagen's largest research and development center outside Germany is in Hefei, China, where the automaker said last month it can now complete every step of the vehicle development and approval process locally for the first time.That capability could help Volkswagen launch cars more quickly in China, with several new models planned for 2026.In the first three quarters of 2025, Volkswagen delivered more than 1.9 million vehicles in China, down 4% from a year ago, less than the 2.4 million vehicles it delivered in Western Europe.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tWeekly analysis and insights from Asia's largest economy in your inbox\n\t\t\tSubscribe now\n\t\t\n\tChina's market size remains lucrative for foreign businesses. \"It's not lost for the U.S. automakers,\" said Sino Auto Insights' Le.He noted that General Motors still delivers nearly 2 million cars a year in China, and, like Ford, also exports cars from the country. The automakers could turn that manufacturing capacity inward if they can design vehicles capable of competing in China, he said, noting \"that's where GM is closer than Ford.\"Le cautioned that it could be too early for any automaker, domestic or foreign, to declare victory in the world's largest auto market.\"But in China, you could be on top one month, and by next quarter, you're playing catch-up and wonder what happened.\"Correction: This story has been updated to reflect Volkswagen's delivery figures. A previous version misstated the numbers.",

    "body": "Apple CEO Tim Cook speaks as Apple holds an event at the Steve Jobs Theater on its campus in Cupertino, California, Sept. 9, 2025.Manuel Orbegozo | ReutersApple has one heck of a mulligan coming ahead of its 50th anniversary in 2026.After failing on its promise to launch an artificial intelligence-supercharged version of Siri in March, Apple said it's on track to make it happen in the new year.The stakes are enormous. Apple's AI failure this year put even more pressure on it to deliver a breakthrough AI experience on the iPhone. Another whiff like that will only cement the idea that Apple is woefully behind its peers in AI and risks losing control over the next major computing platform to a rival like Google or a startup like OpenAI.Not only that, Apple must prove to investors that AI can generate meaningful sales growth after years of post-pandemic stagnation.How Apple got hereWe knew it was going to be a challenging 2025 for Apple long before the calendar turned over to the new year.With President Donald Trump's inauguration looming, no major tech company was more exposed to his impending tariff scheme than Apple.And then there was the looming AI question. Apple launched limited features for its Apple Intelligence system in the fall, but the real update, an AI-powered version of Siri that Apple advertised as a key feature in the iPhone 16, was scheduled to launch early in 2025. Apple shares were reaching new highs in anticipation of a groundbreaking AI experience built into the iPhone. It was all for nothing. It took months for Apple CEO Tim Cook to play the politician and woo the president with the promise of $600 billion in U.S. investments over the next four years, culminating in a stunning moment in the Oval Office when Cook gave the president a glass trophy with a solid gold base. The ploy worked. Even though analysts pointed out most of Cook's promised spending was already baked in, the president thought it was good enough. Trump dropped his demands for Apple to build iPhones on U.S. soil and gave Cook the tariff relief he wanted. With the tariff problem out of the way, Apple shares surged. The stock is up about 35% since that show in the Oval Office.Read more CNBC tech newsElon Musk envisions humanoid robots everywhere. China may be the first to make it a realityMeta acquires intelligent agent firm Manus, capping year of aggressive AI movesSoftbank to buy data center firm DigitalBridge for $4 billion in AI pushCalifornia's Ro Khanna faces Silicon Valley backlash after embracing wealth taxLet's try that again...Now, Apple has to solve its AI problem. Following an exodus of top execs, including AI boss John Giannandrea, Apple said it has the team in place to deliver the Siri upgrade in 2026, which could come as much as 21 months after the original announcement.Apple needs that new Siri to be good. Not just good enough to match the capabilities of popular AI chatbots like ChatGPT and Gemini, but also good enough to convince folks with older iPhones to upgrade to a new device so they can use it. Users need an iPhone 15 Pro or better to use Apple Intelligence.That was the Apple bull case a year ago. That Apple Intelligence, especially the new version of Siri, was going to be so amazing that people would get a new iPhone just to use it. That elusive iPhone \"super cycle\" was on the horizon. Nope. Perhaps next year. For investors, it's their best bet to see a boom in Apple shares from AI.Unlike the $20 per month OpenAI charges to use the full version of ChatGPT, Apple doesn't charge for Apple Intelligence. Unless Apple changes its strategy and starts charging a subscription, its only hope is to leverage AI to move new iPhones, Macs and iPads. It also opens up Apple to launch different kinds of hardware products, like the rumored smart glasses that could come as soon as next fall. But don't count on an accessory like that moving the needle too much at Apple. Apple rarely misses the way it did with AI this year, especially with something as important and as transformative as AI. Luckily for Apple, it's still early in the AI game. And it proved this year with the iPhone 17 lineup that new hardware designs and features can lead to sales growth. But it can only miss once. There's not going to be another chance for a mulligan.watch now",

    "body": "watch nowMortgage rates are lower, home prices are easing and there is more supply on the market for sale. All of that adds up to improved affordability for today's homebuyers. Saving for a down payment, however, is still the biggest hurdle for first-time buyers. Prices nationally are basically flat compared with where they were a year ago, according to Parcl Labs, which runs daily studies of U.S. home prices. They dipped into negative territory earlier this month and are now just 0.3% higher year over year. The latest S&P Cotality Case-Shiller home price index, which reflects pricing from October, showed large disparities among metropolitan markets. Of the top 20 markets it highlights, Chicago; New York; and Cleveland had the biggest gains. Meanwhile eight cities showed prices in negative territory, with Tampa, Florida; Phoenix; and Dallas seeing the biggest losses. \"National home prices also continue to lag consumer inflation, as October's CPI is estimated around 3.1% (based on a provisional index the U.S. Treasury announced due to the federal data shutdown) – roughly 1.8 percentage points higher than the latest housing appreciation. In real terms, that gap implies a slight decline in inflation-adjusted home values over the past year,\" explained Nicholas Godec, head of fixed income tradables and commodities at S&P Dow Jones Indices, in a release.Mortgage rates, too, are coming down. The average on the 30-year fixed mortgage is currently at 6.19%, according to Mortgage News Daily. It started this year well over 7%. That decline means significant savings for homebuyers. For example, for a buyer putting down 20% on a $410,000 home (right around the national median), the monthly payment today is $200 less on average than it would have been a year ago. Weaker prices and lower rates are changing the math on what first-time buyers can afford.

That's down from the recent peak of 12 years in 2022, but still roughly double pre-pandemic levels, partly because the personal savings rate is so much lower than it was in 2020. Down payments continue to be the biggest hurdle to homeownership, which in the second half of this year fell to 65%, according to the U.S. Census, the lowest level since 2019.But an improved supply of homes for sale is adding momentum to the market. Active listings are now about 12% higher than they were a year ago, according to Realtor.com, but still 6% lower than they were just pre-pandemic.And buyers appear to be responding. Pending home sales, which count signed contracts on existing homes, rose more than expected in November. They were 3.3% higher than October, 2.6% higher than November 2024 and hit the highest level in nearly three years, according to the National Association of Realtors. \"Improving housing affordability–driven by lower mortgage rates and wage growth rising faster than home prices–is helping buyers test the market. More inventory choices compared to last year are also attracting more buyers to the market,\" said Lawrence Yun, chief economist for the Realtors, in a release. ",

    "body": "watch nowCalifornia Democrat Rep. Ro Khanna says he has a solution for Silicon Valley elites angered by his embrace of a wealth tax: Tackling fraud. Over the weekend, Khanna came under fire from some donors and allies in the tech industry after he endorsed a wealth tax. Labor groups in California are trying to add a proposal for a statewide tax on billionaires to the November ballot, prompting some wealthy Californians to warn they will leave the state if it passes and support a primary challenger to Khanna in next year's elections. In an interview with CNBC, Khanna, who represents Silicon Valley, said he's launching a bipartisan effort from his post on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee to root out state-level fraud to ensure the new tax windfall doesn't go to waste. The effort, he said, will make sure that funds go toward health care and other essential services.\"If you want, as I do, to advocate for Medicare for all, to advocate for higher taxes, you have to have the public trust,\" Khanna said. \"People need to have a receipt for what their money is going toward. You can't have corruption in the government and waste in the government and then expect people to support the progressive ideals that I have.\"Khanna said he will find someone on the other side of the aisle to work with on the issue, similar to his recent partnership with Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., that compelled the release of files relating to notorious sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Khanna said he hopes to commission a bipartisan Government Accountability Office report on state-level fraud and hold hearings on the issue. U.S. Representative Thomas Massie (R-KY), accompanied by U.S. Representatives Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) and Ro Khanna (D-CA), speaks during a press conference on the Epstein Files Transparency Act ahead of a House vote on the release of files related to the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C., U.S., November 18, 2025. Annabelle Gordon | ReutersKhanna's pitch comes after the California State Auditor released new reports that identified potential fraud in the state. Meanwhile, alleged fraud cases in Minnesota, some leading to indictments first handed down in 2022, have also seen renewed national attention from Republican lawmakers and the Trump administration. Many who criticized Khanna's endorsement of a wealth tax cited those instances of fraud as a reason that the tax won't work.\"If, after audits and zero based budgets, there are revenue gaps, I'd support a wealth tax,\" said Chamath Palihapitiya, a prominent tech investor and Trump supporter, in a post to X. \"Until then, you and your ilk are just getting more incentives for fraud, voter manipulation and larceny.\"Khanna noted that his new oversight effort is in response to \"feedback from constituents in my district and leaders\" over his embrace of a wealth tax. He added that the investigation will cover more than just the fraud uncovered in California and Minnesota, and that finding a Republican partner will prevent the investigation from becoming a partisan affair. \"It's not going to be a blue state or a red state thing,\" Khanna said. \"Obviously, there have been the reports in Minnesota and California, but it's beyond that. We need to look at state government and making not just an issue against blue states, but to expose where this fraud is happening and what we can do about it.\" California and Minnesota are both run by Democratic governors. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, the former Democratic vice presidential candidate, is up for reelection in 2026.

The Service Employees International Union-United Healthcare Workers West labor union is pushing the measure.The measure still needs to garner enough signatures to qualify for the ballot. If it does, it would be up to California voters to decide on installing the new tax. Tech leaders opposing the proposal are concerned the tax would apply to unrealized gains, meaning startup founders with a net worth of more than $1 billion based on the paper value of their private stock would be on the hook despite their wealth being illiquid. Khanna acknowledged those concerns in the interview, saying he supports a wealth tax to pay for health care in California and federally, but with the caveat that there are \"workarounds for stock that is restricted with illiquid founders who have companies that are not profitable.\"\"You can do it in a way that doesn't hurt the startup paper billionaires with restricted stock,\" he said. ",

    "body": "The LKAB facility in Kiruna, Sweden. The company said on Jan. 12 that it found Europe's biggest known deposit of rare earth elements there.Jonas Ekstromer | Afp | Getty ImagesThe ripple effects from Europe's growing appetite for raw materials extend all the way to Sweden's far north. Thousands of residents and buildings are being uprooted in Kiruna, a city that lies 145 kilometers (90 miles) north of the Arctic Circle. The relocation project is regarded as one of the world's most radical urban transformations.Kiruna is physically on the move because of ground subsidence from the expansion of a sprawling underground iron ore mine. A new home is being created about 3 kilometers east of the old town as part of a multi-decade process that's expected to be completed by 2035. \"It's a place that would seem exotic to so many and, in a way, I guess it is, but also it is a small town like so many others — struggling with what they are struggling with and challenged by being so dependent on one company,\" Jennie Sjöholm, senior lecturer at Sweden's University of Gothenburg, told CNBC by video call.  Established 125 years ago as a city for the iron ore mining operations of state-owned firm LKAB, Kiruna is a small community that serves as both a significant European space hub and home to the world's largest underground iron ore mine. Every resident in Kiruna knows that we have to move from our homes sooner or later because we are dependent on this mining industry.Mats TaavenikuChairman of the municipal council in KirunaLKAB is small in global terms but a highly significant regional player, accounting for 80% of all iron ore mined in the European Union. Alongside its iron ore operations, which are integral to the steel-making process, LKAB recently identified one of Europe's largest known deposits of rare earths, further strengthening its position in the extraction of essential materials for the green transition. Moving a cityThere are several obstacles to the successful relocation of Kiruna, with players across the spectrum raising political, economic and environmental concerns. Indeed, both the municipality and LKAB have called for greater financial support from the state, as well as the release of more land to accommodate the transformation. Others have also flagged concerns about the relationship between resource extraction and community sustainability, particularly regarding the potential impact on indigenous Sami reindeer herding and culture. In this aerial view, the Kiruna Kyrka church is transported by road to a new location on August 20, 2025 in Kiruna, Sweden. The church, weighing 672,4 tons, is being transported as a whole to a new location 3 km away to avoid damages caused by LKAB´s iron ore mine.Bernd Lauter | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesThe city's relocation, which was first planned in 2004, received international attention in August 2025 during the spectacular move of its iconic Kiruna Church. In a feat of engineering, the 113-year-old timber building was moved in its entirety by specialized trailers over a period of two days. At around the same time, however, LKAB also announced the expansion of its iron ore mine would require the relocation of an additional 6,000 people and 2,700 homes. The mining company, which is responsible for the move, has estimated compensation costs of 22.5 billion SEK ($2.4 billion) over the next 10 years.Read moreNiklas Johansson, senior vice president of public affairs and external relations at LKAB, told CNBC that those being asked to relocate were being offered the market value of their property, plus an additional 25%, or the construction of a new home. Around 90% have elected to take a new house, Johansson said. \"The problem at the moment is that the local municipality has very little land that they own [or] that they can make, from an administrative point of view, buildable,\" Johansson said.\"They have had to buy land from the state, who owns most of the land above the Arctic Circle. And here you have conflicts with reindeer herding, conflicts with defense, conflicts with nature, etcetera,\" he added.  'We live on the minerals'Mats Taaveniku, chairman of the municipal council in Kiruna, described the city's relocation as a \"huge project,\" that could yield major opportunities for European citizens for decades to come. A successful outcome, he added, hinges in part on greater financial and political support from both the Swedish government and the European Union. \"We have what we can call a big fight between the municipality and LKAB, and the municipality and our own government,\" Taaveniku told CNBC by video call. \"The EU has to step up to support us. It's not enough to make a decision that we have critical and strategic minerals. They have to support us with political statements and money, of course,\" he added. CNBC has contacted spokespeople for the Swedish government and the European Commission, the EU's executive arm. A foundry worker handles molten metal at the Betsaide plant, which primarily serves the automotive industry, in Elorrio, on May 26, 2025.Ander Gillenea | Afp | Getty ImagesThe EU, for its part, has recognized LKAB's new rare earths deposit as strategically important under its Critical Raw Materials Act, a policy that aims for domestic production to satisfy 40% of the region's annual demand by 2030.Asked how Kiruna residents have reacted to the relocation effort, Taaveniku said: \"Some of the citizens are sad because they will lose a lot of memories. They have grown up in a house for two or maybe three generations, so this is sad.\"\"But on the other hand, everybody knows, we live on the minerals,\" he said. \"Kiruna is built on the minerals, so every resident in Kiruna knows that we have to move from our homes sooner or later because we are dependent on this mining industry.\" Out in the cold?For those on the move, one aspect that has raised concerns is that Kiruna's new city may be up to 10 degrees Celsius colder in the winter. A study by the University of Gothenburg found that Kiruna's new city center is laid out in a grid pattern in an area where cold air collects, with tall buildings and narrow streets, meaning that the low sun will likely have difficulty reaching the ground for many months of the year.A worker is pictured in the underground tunnels of the LKAB iron ore mine in Kiruna, northern Sweden, on August 21, 2025.Jonathan Nackstrand | Afp | Getty Images\"Kiruna is a winter city. It's a cold, Arctic city. The winters are long, and you have a long snow season. It is rarely -35 [degrees Celsius] but it could be that cold for a period of time in mid-winter and it's a very big difference between -15, which is not uncommon, and -25,\" Sjöholm said. A built heritage specialist, Sjöholm has been following the work on the city's relocation for 25 years.\"It's already a long winter season and if it's cold, human comfort decreases but also things get more fragile, so to speak,\" she added.",

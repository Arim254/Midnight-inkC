    "body": "It's important to build resilience, but how do we actually do it? I've spent 15 years researching happiness, and I've interviewed thousands of people about what makes it possible for them to thrive. I've learned that resilience isn't something you're born with. It's not even about bouncing back, a concept that often does more harm than good. Real resilience is about building specific habits that train your brain to weather difficulty without breaking. Here are 9 habits that actually work:1. Reframing stress as a signal, not a threatIf your heart is racing before your big meeting, your instinct might be to panic. Before you do, pause and tell yourself: \"I'm excited about this.\"I know it sounds like toxic positivity. It's not. Research shows that this simple reframing, shifting from a threat to a challenge, can change your physiological response. Your body doesn't easily distinguish between anxiety and excitement. The only difference is your interpretation. 2. Making one micro-decision daily with confidenceWhen you constantly second-guess yourself, your brain learns that you can't be trusted to handle outcomes. Confident micro-decisions can help rewire your brain and boost your trust in yourself.So pick your lunch without researching five options. Commit to a movie in two minutes flat. Send the email without editing it 10 times. This teaches your brain: \"I can decide and handle what comes next, even if it's not perfect.\" That's the exact skill you need in a crisis. 3. Building your support system with intentionIt's extremely difficult to maintain deep relationships with hundreds of people. Research has found we can manage about 150 stable relationships, but only about five truly intimate ones. The most emotionally resilient people don't spread their emotional energy thin or try to handle everything alone. They invest in these core relationships. And when things do get hard, they have people in their corner who can help them carry the weight. 4. Creating a 'done' list instead of a to-do listMost of us focus on what's left undone. It's a perpetual sense of failure. I want you to flip this.Every day, write down what you actually accomplished, even the small stuff. Over time, your brain stops noticing gaps and starts noticing progress. That shift is where resilience lives.5. Noticing and savoring one good moment every dayWhen you deliberately pay attention to positive moments, you rewire neural pathways for happiness. Pick one moment a day worth savoring. A good conversation. A small win. Really good coffee. Spend 30 seconds actually noticing it. This practice counteracts your brain's obsession with what's wrong and builds psychological resilience, one moment at a time.6. Practicing honesty in your closest relationshipsBe vulnerable with the people who matter to you. Tell someone about a real challenge. Ask for honest feedback, not just agreement. Have conversations where things might get uncomfortable.The most resilient people feel safe to be themselves without fear of judgement. Being open with people who you trust can help build that muscle. 7. Helping someone else, before you need helpThis sounds counterintuitive until you realize that helping others is a powerful recharge practice. Plus, you're building your support system for the future. You're reinforcing your identity as capable and resourceful.Most importantly, you remember that resilience is also about contributing and mattering to other people.8. Asking yourself, 'What's the worst that could happen?'Most people avoid this question because they are afraid of the answer. But research shows that actually imagining the worst-case scenario can reduce anxiety, not increase it.So after you ask yourself, \"What's the worst that could happen?\" actually sit with the question. Then ask yourself, \"Could I handle that?\" The answer is usually yes. Maybe not easily, but yes.The most resilient people understand that bad things can happen, but the most important thing is to be confident that you can handle them when they do.9. Practicing these habits in low-stakes momentsEmotional resilience is a skill you can hone. It doesn't require therapy, meditation retreats, or years of work. Start with just one or two of these habits. Reframe stress when the stakes are low. Build your support relationships now, not when you're desperate. Make confident decisions about small things, so you're ready for big things.Jessica Weiss is a keynote speaker and executive coach who teaches people and businesses how to find more happiness, fulfillment and satisfaction at work.

    "body": "For couples, \"holidays are a scary time\" because they often call for revealing a new side of yourself to your partner, says Sabrina Romanoff, New York-based psychologist and a relationship expert for dating app Hily. Some people have decades-long, big family traditions they want to uphold. Others prefer to keep it low key. Whatever the activities are, and whatever the meaning behind them, opening up about what matters to you can feel very vulnerable.  Ultimately, the goal is to blend \"each other's cultures and worlds,\" says Romanoff. Here's how successful couples tackle this festive time of year. They're 'direct and honest' about what they want First, each partner has to know what they want and be open about it.Do they want their partner to join them for their family Christmas? Do they want to take some time off and have a quiet Hanukkah? \"You are better off being direct and honest with your partner so you both can really get what you both need,\" says Romanoff.Ultimately, there will likely have to be some flexibility, on both sides. \"I think the healthiest couples are those who can get creative and compromise,\" she says. \"There's only one Christmas Eve, there's only one Christmas Day.\" Maybe this year, the couple spends time with one side's family and next year they spend time with the other. They create new traditions togetherSecond, successful couples create new traditions together. \"That could mean going to see the tree together a Rockefeller Center,\" says Romanoff, \"or getting an ornament together.\" It could mean cooking a holiday meal or doing a hot chocolate crawl. Building something new together is a bonding experience. \"I think that's what brings security\" in the relationship, she says.Want to give your kids the ultimate advantage?

    "body": "Most parents know the frustration of dealing with a child's unexpected public tantrum.But parents are often too quick to call out their child's negative behavior — chastising them for that unnecessary meltdown or even telling them to \"cheer up\" when they seem sad — while ignoring the underlying emotions behind those actions, according to parenting expert Reem Raouda.Focusing solely on children's behaviors, particularly bad behavior, rather than investigating and validating their emotions is a common parenting mistake that hinders your child's ability to develop emotional intelligence, says Raouda, an author and certified conscious parenting coach.\"Stop focusing on their behavior and start focusing on their [well-being],\" she says. \"Children are not robots, and their emotions are being completely ignored, dismissed [or even] punished.\"Experts often link emotional intelligence to success, because it helps people manage the kinds of negative emotions that could otherwise lead to burnout, anxiety or depression, research shows.\"Your emotional well-being is your success,\" says Raouda, adding that parents who ignore their kids' emotional development are less likely to raise happy, successful adults. \"Who cares about how much money you have, if you are anxiety-ridden, depressed, [and] don't know who you are?\"DON'T MISS: The ultimate guide to teaching your kids about moneyParents do need to enforce boundaries, Raouda says, particularly when a child's outburst involves mistreating other people. They also need to remind kids that their feelings — positive or negative — are normal, and that it's healthy to express them constructively, she says.Focus on \"not making them feel bad for their anger [and] not telling them to cheer up when they're sad,\" says Raouda. \"Letting them be in their feelings is No. 1.\"You might, for example, ask your child what they were feeling that led them to act out, break a rule or otherwise cross a previously established boundary. Helping your kids name their emotions is the first step toward them developing the ability to manage those emotions, Raouda says.Some other experts agree: Children who feel heard and not shamed for their feelings typically become more open to avoiding negative behaviors, according to psychologist Caroline Fleck. \"The point is to validate the emotion and then focus on what's not valid, which is the behavior [and that's] what needs to change,\" Fleck told CNBC Make It in January.Parents who overemphasize obedience, which can require the suppression of big feelings, run the risk of raising people-pleasers who can't advocate for themselves and are more likely to grow into anxious, unhappy adults, Raouda says.A mother herself, Raouda says she'd practice emotion-naming exercises with her son even when he was too young to articulate how he was feeling on his own. That involved asking if he was angry or frustrated and, if so, having him rank the severity of his feelings on a scale of 1 to 10, she says.And when parents feel emotional themselves, they can tell their children directly: I'm upset, or I'm sad. The idea is to show your children that you don't have to suppress those negative feelings, says Raouda.\"Naming it takes away from the [negative] stigma,\" she says. \"It's just, like, 'Yeah, I was angry, I was embarrassed, I was sad, I was nervous' … Feelings are normal and healthy and fine.\"Want to give your kids the ultimate advantage?

    "body": "A photo showing President Donald Trump's face that was included in the release of the investigative files on notorious sex predator Jeffrey Epstein — and more than a dozen other files — appears to have been removed from the Department of Justice's website.The photo, released on Friday along with a slew of other files, shows a desk displaying a large assortment of framed and unframed photographs and other items. Among those photographs are at least two that clearly show Trump's face.Lawmakers on Saturday were quick to note that the image was missing from the DOJ website. \"This photo, file 468, from the Epstein files that includes Donald Trump has apparently now been removed from the DOJ release,\" Democrats on the House Oversight Committee said in a post on X. \"@AGPamBondi is this true? What else is being covered up? We need transparency for the American public.\"The photo featuring Trump was among the at least 16 files that disappeared from the site, the Associated Press reported Saturday.Friday's release included only some of the vast number of documents required to be disclosed under a deadline set by the Epstein Files Transparency Act, which mandated that the DOJ divulge all the files. The DOJ continued its partial release with more files tied to the investigation early Saturday.Congress is considering holding impeachment hearings about Attorney General Pam Bondi and Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche if the documents that were released don't comply with the law, Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., said Friday.\"What we need is a clear timeline of when the rest of the documents will be released and an explanation for why they did not release all of them today,\" Khanna said during a press conference following the files' release.Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., who co-sponsored the House bill with Khanna that ordered the Justice Department to release the files, on Saturday, accused the DOJ of openly disregarding the law.\"Compare Language of Epstein Files Transparency Act directing DOJ to provide internal communications regarding their decisions Versus DOJ letter to Congress asserting privilege to omit materials related to decisions, because they weren't specified by law,\" Massie wrote in a post on X.From left, Donald Trump and his girlfriend (and future wife), former model Melania Knauss, financier (and future convicted sex offender) Jeffrey Epstein, and British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell pose together at the Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Florida on Feb. 12, 2000.Davidoff Studios Photography | Archive Photos | Getty ImagesWhile Trump is a former friend of Epstein, the president has not been accused of wrongdoing. He has also denied his awareness of Epstein's sexual abuse of underage girls and women.The appearance of Trump's name and image was noticeably scarce in the files made public Friday. Recently, however, Trump has been shown in a number of images that were released by House Democrats, who obtained the photos directly from Epstein's estate.The DOJ said in a post on X late Friday that it wasn't \"redacting the names of any politicians\" and cited comments made by Blanche reiterating such.\"The only redactions being applied to the documents are those required by law — full stop,\" Blanche said. \"Consistent with the statute and applicable laws, we are not redacting the names of individuals or politicians unless they are a victim.\"Blanche, who previously served as a criminal defense lawyer for Trump, echoed that sentiment in an interview with ABC News on Friday, saying that there has been \"no effort\" to redact any mention of the president in the files' release.The White House referred questions about the missing photo to the DOJ.CNBC has reached out to the Justice Department as well as House Oversight Committee Ranking Member Rep. Robert Garcia, D-Calif., for comment.Former President Bill Clinton appeared in several photos released Friday, and it is unclear when or where they were taken. One showed Clinton sitting in a chair next to a young woman, who sat on the chair's armrest.The former president has also not been accused of wrongdoing.Clinton's spokesman, Angel Urena, on Friday said, \"The White House hasn't been hiding these files for months only to dump them late on a Friday to protect Bill Clinton. This is about shielding themselves from what comes next, or from what they'll try and hide forever. So they can release as many grainy 20-plus-year-old photos as they want but this isn't about Bill Clinton.\"\"There are two types of people here. The first group knew nothing and cut Epstein off before his crimes came to light,\" Urena added. \"The second group continued relationships with him after. We're in the first. No amount of stalling by people in the second group will change that. Everyone, especially MAGA, expects answers, not scapegoats.\"— CNBC's Dan Mangan contributed to this report.",

Elizabeth Frantz | ReutersU.S. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said she was suspending the diversity visa program at President Donald Trump's direction, saying the man suspected of killing two students at Brown University and a MIT professor had been granted one.Noem posted on X late Thursday that she had instructed the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services to pause the (DV1) program \"to ensure no more Americans are harmed by this disastrous program.\"On Dec. 13, two students died and nine others were injured when someone opened fire at the physics building at Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island. Police later identified Portuguese national Claudio Manuel Neves Valente, 48, as the suspect.Valente was a former student at the university and had been enrolled in a Ph.D. program in physics in 2000, the university's president, Christina H. Paxson, said. Valente is also suspected of having killed MIT physics professor Nuno Loureiro, 47, in his home in Brookline, Massachusetts, two days after the Brown shooting. Valente and Loureiro are believed to have attended the same university in their native Portugal.Authorities announced the suspect's identity hours after Valente was found dead in a New Hampshire storage facility on Thursday, Providence Police Chief Oscar Perez said. Guns were also found at the scene.\"There's no longer a threat to the public,\" the U.S. attorney's office in Boston said in a statement after Valente's death was confirmed. Authorities believe Valente acted alone and have not disclosed a motive for the killings. Noem said that Valente entered the U.S. through the DV1 program in 2017 and was granted a green card.\"In 2017, President Trump fought to end this program, following the devastating NYC truck ramming by an ISIS terrorist, who entered under the DV1 program, and murdered eight people,\" she wrote on X.The Diversity Immigrant Visa Program (DV Program) allocates up to 50,000 immigrant visas every year, according to the USCIS website.The program is a lottery. Visas are randomly allocated to individuals from countries with low rates of immigration to the U.S.— Dan Mangan contributed to this report.",

    "body": "watch nowBuild-A-Bear Workshop wasn't always a retail winner.The toy store, known for its interactive experience of building and accessorizing stuffed animals, has gone through a significant turnaround since CEO Sharon Price John took the helm of the company over a decade ago.\"When I first came in 2013, that assessment of the brand was strong,\" she told CNBC. \"We don't have a broken brand, we have a broken business, and when you started doing interviews, you really understood how much this brand meant to people.\"The company found initial success in malls in the early 2000s, but Build-A-Bear's stock plunged after the 2008 financial crisis, with the company reporting a $49 million loss in fiscal 2012.Under Price John, the company began investing in e-commerce, shifting orders to stores instead of its distribution center and diversifying its sales beyond just malls to turn around the company.\"Our goal overall was to create sustained, profitable growth, but the profitable was first,\" Price John said.That strategy worked. Virtually all of Build-A-Bear's stores are now profitable, and the stock experienced an Nvidia-like run earlier this year, hitting an all-time high of about $76 in September. The stock has come down some since then, but it's still up more than 125% over the past two years.But tariffs have taken a hit to the business. Build-A-Bear imports over 90% of its products from China and Vietnam, and the company said in its third-quarter earnings report in early December that it expects to take a roughly $11 million hit from tariffs for fiscal 2025.Company executives also said on a call with analysts that the company experienced a slowdown in traffic in October during the government shutdown.Small Cap Consumer Research analyst Eric Beder wrote in a note this month that the firm was lowering projections and reducing its price target by $10 due to the company reporting lighter-than-expected revenue and the \"implied deep tariff impacts.\"Still, the company is outperforming most of its retail competitors, expecting to reach $500 million in annual revenue for the first time.\"You can buy stuffed animals or a plush pretty much everywhere, right from Target to FAO Schwarz and every place in between,\" Beder told CNBC. \"The difference is that at Build-A-Bear, it's yours. You helped make it.\"Watch the video to learn more about how Build-A-Bear has made its comeback.",

    "body": "watch nowWhile discounts drove purchasing in the early days of the holiday shopping season, consumers are shifting into more thoughtful, quality gifts in the back half of the season as total spending growth slows.U.S. consumers had spent $187.3 billion so far online between Nov. 1 and Dec. 12, up 6.1% from the same stretch last year, according to Adobe Analytics. Total holiday season e-commerce spend is still expected to cross $253 billion, which would be 5.3% above last year, with the growth rate slowing later into December as delivery in time for Christmas gets tighter. E-commerce sales typically \"slow sharply\" from about Dec. 16 to Dec. 18, and then \"decline rapidly\" in the ensuing days, until Christmas Eve is the slowest shopping day of the season, Casey Armstrong, chief marketing officer for ShipBob, told CNBC. Armstrong said shopping picks up again on Dec. 27, which is typically the strongest day for ShipBob's customers late in the season. The company is a third-party logistics firm that ships for small, medium and social-oriented brands. A shopper carries packages in Union Square in San Francisco, Dec. 11, 2025.David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesFor shoppers who are willing to order online in the back half of the season, quality, rather than discounts, is driving interest. Captify analyzes more than 1 billion search events per day from 3 million websites, and it shows outsize search growth in apparel and athleisure brands including Alo Yoga, Warby Parker, Aritzia, Bombas and Quince into December compared to earlier in the season. Searches for Alo Yoga rose 256% for the period between Dec. 7 and Dec. 15 compared to the stretch from Nov. 28 to Dec. 6. Quince searches are up 124% for those same time frames. \"These gains point to a rise in thoughtful, quality-driven gifting as shoppers seek products from highly regarded brands\" said Oscar Chow, Captify head of insights for the U.S.RetailNext, which tracks in-store shopping, has also seen evidence of consumers valuing quality this season, even if that means buying fewer items. \"Consumers are willing to pay more to get those decisions right\" said Joe Shasteen, global manager of advanced analytics at RetailNext. The firm expects this dynamic to peak in the days leading up to Christmas.There is also evidence showing a shift toward gifting experiences and subscriptions as the season winds down. Chow said they offer shoppers a \"deadline-proof gift.\"Examples include growth in interest in the later weeks of the season for Roblox Robux, Cameo Kids, Kindle Unlimited, Strava Subscription, Peloton All-Access, MasterClass subscriptions and the Disney+, Hulu and HBO Max subscription bundle.Discounts are still available as holiday shopping winds down, but they're much lower than during Cyber Week highs. Adobe Analytics said toys will see the biggest promotions, peaking at 15% off list price in December, followed by furniture, bedding and televisions at 10% off.To be sure, there are discount-motivated consumers throughout the season, which makes toys a strong category. Data from Adobe and Captify show consumers are still seeking out Mattel's Barbie Dreamhouse, Disney's Stitch toys, and Play-Doh sets, among others. Armstrong said the Toniebox 2 audio player and the Ms. Rachel Tonies figurine is \"a top item driving buzz\".Stores save ChristmasA woman holds shopping bags as people make their way through Herald Square on Dec. 11, 2025 in New York City. Angela Weiss | AFP | Getty ImagesFor those that want a physical gift to give, stores are critical in the days leading up to Christmas.The last Saturday before Christmas has been coined \"Super Saturday\" by the retail sector and is often one of the top store shopping days of the year. But with Christmas landing on a Thursday this year, the volume will likely be lower on Super Saturday this year than on Dec. 22 through Dec. 24, according to RetailNext. \"We expect some of the highest conversion rates of the season to occur in the final days before Christmas, potentially rivaling or even surpassing Black Friday,\" Shasteen of RetailNext said. The warmer temperatures and dry conditions hitting much of the country this weekend should also help lift store traffic this weekend, according to Evan Gold, Planalytics executive vice president of global partnerships and alliances.Shoppers who don't want to navigate stores, but also don't want to chance shipping timelines, are increasingly using buy online, pick up in store options in the final stretch of the holiday shopping season. Adobe Analytics predicts BOPIS will peak on Dec. 22 and Dec. 23, with 32% to 37% of e-commerce orders utilizing the service, a spike in typical usage from the rest of the year.Kohl's told CNBC its pickup orders more than double in the week leading up to Christmas and that a quarter of shoppers who pickup an online order end up buying something else while they are there. At Bath and Body Works, about 30% of customers picking up online orders add something before checkout. It's also a cost savings for retailers to fulfill online orders from stores. Target has said order pickup or drive-up saves the retailer 90% over brown-box delivery from fulfillment centers. So far this season, three-quarters of its digital orders have been picked up from stores.Walmart told CNBC last year that weekly scheduled pickup volume increased 14% in the two weeks leading up to Christmas compared to the average volume in the prior 12 weeks. More than 80% of Walmart customers say they shop in-store in the three days before Christmas, according to its customer insights and strategy holiday pulse tracker conducted this month.Last December, volumes of Walmart Express Delivery, orders fulfilled from store inventory that come with an extra fee, reached 2.5 times the monthly average. The retailer said on Christmas Eve alone, 77% of digital orders were fulfilled via the express option.While Dick's Sporting Goods declined to share specifics, the retailer said it sees a \"significant uptick in BOPIS\" as Christmas nears, and it also sees an \"attach rate\" for shoppers \"to make sure they grab those last-minute gifts on a single trip to the store.\"",

    "body": "Capsule hotels are a cheap alternative to expensive accomodation in London for office workers.Sawdah BhaimiyaWorkers who moved out of London for remote work are under pressure to come back to the office in the city, and some are choosing to stay in Japanese-inspired sleeping pods for just £30 ($40). I travelled to Piccadilly Circus in the heart of London to spend a night in a newly opened capsule hotel, after two of my colleagues who live outside the city recommended staying there. Zedwell Capsule Hotel, a brand owned by Criterion Capital, opened in September and offers nearly 1,000 capsules measuring 1 meter long, 1 meter wide, and 2 meters in depth — likely the smallest hotel rooms in London. It has a rather unassuming exterior despite being located inside the historic London Pavilion building — originally built as a music hall in 1885. The entrance is around the corner of the busy station, through some black doors.Private sleeping capsules alongside each other in Zedwell Capsule Hotel in London.Sawdah BhaimiyaThe cost of staying in a hotel in Central London is staggering, sitting at an average of £265 per night in the third quarter of 2025, according to real estate firm Knight Frank. In comparison, the average daily rate of hotels across Europe was 125 euros in the summer, according to an analysis of over 600,000 reservations from 2,000 independent hotels by RoomRaccoon. Criterion's Head of Hotels Halima Aziz told me that the capsule hotel addresses a gap in the market between budget hostels and affordable accommodation. \"We've formed this sweet spot between the two. We're not a budget hostel. We're not coming in at a £15 rate, giving you a bunk bed in a steel room,\" she said. \"When we decided to get into capsules, we really took inspiration from Asia, and the capsule concept was really born out of Japan as a response to very similar pressures we're facing in London.\" In Japan, the first capsule hotel was built in the city of Osaka in 1979, primarily to serve as an inexpensive overnight option for salarymen who worked late and preferred to stay out drinking and socializing rather than spending more money commuting home. It's given rise to some capsule-style hotels in New York, from sleeping pods by Kama Central Park, to Nap York, a sleeping station with private pods for short naps or overnight stays. Now that the concept has come to London, I was keen to see for myself what the British version has to offer.Inside a sleeping capsuleInside a sleeping capsule in Zedwell Capsule Hotel in London.Sawdah BhaimiyaIt's a Monday evening, and instead of my usual work-from-home routine, which involves preparing to go into the office the next day, I'm crawling into a brightly lit sleeping pod.I roll down the garage-like shutters and lock it from the inside as I prepare to sleep. My head is just inches beneath the ceiling of my pod, which has a light dimmer, two clothing hooks, an air purifier, a wide mirror stretching along the head of the capsule, and charger sockets. Although I can feel my luggage — a backpack and tote bag — at the end of my bed, and the bottom of my coat hung on the hooks, I'm surprised by how comfortable and cozy the bedding is. I switch off the lights and noisy air purifier and find myself enveloped by pitch black and silence. It feels eerie, but with nothing to distract me, I fall asleep quickly.Each capsule measures 1 meter long, 1 meter wide, and 2 meters in depth.Sawdah BhaimiyaEarlier in the day, I checked myself into the hotel using one of four kiosks, and as I roamed around the hotel, I noticed that the walls were painted black to match the exterior — and there isn't a single window in sight. I rode up to the first floor and used a key card to access my female-only dormitory. My capsule was one of seven stacked side by side or on top of each other, and some were only accessible via steps. A female-only dormitory inside Zedwell Capsule Hotel.Sawdah BhaimiyaI learned that despite the low initial cost, there was a series of additional amenities guests can pay for, from an extra £10 to be in a female-only dormitory, to £8 for a padlock, and £15 to store luggage securely. The hotel had an unfinished feel. The entrance was covered in scaffolding and the faint sound of drilling could be heard from inside the building. That's because it is \"still under construction,\" Zedwell's General Manager Greg Walsh told me. The drilling sounds were coming from underground where a larger reception was being built, with direct links to Piccadilly Circus Station. CEO Aziz confirmed that the building is not complete, adding that the additional cost for the female dorms was largely due to upgraded amenities, including a towel inside the pod and a female-only beauty room complete with hairdryers  — although this is still under construction and not currently accessible. \"Ultimately, if you're not just targeting the traditional hostel market, and you want to widen access, you need to respond to people's needs, and people have needs for laundry, for beauty, that wouldn't typically be considered,\" she added. While exploring the building, I found shared toilets and showers with classical music playing inside, as well as vending machines in the reception with snacks, drinks, slippers and eye masks amongst other items. I wandered out for dinner and with Oxford Circus, Leicester Square, and Covent Garden within walking distance, it wasn't hard to entertain myself. Zedwell Capsule Hotel is located in Piccadilly Circus, London.Sawdah BhaimiyaWorkers are coming back to the city During my time in the hotel, I discovered I was one of many working professionals in the building. I spotted several guests arriving in suits and ties and carrying briefcases. One chef from Newcastle even told me he paid a total of £284 to stay in the hotel for a fortnight to work in London. During the Covid-19 pandemic, many office workers in London moved out of the city, where it was cheaper to rent or own a home, due to remote and flexible working options becoming a normality. \"The cost of commuting from Oxford, Cambridge, city centers that aren't accessible via the London Underground system, is quite high.\"Halima AzizCriterion's Head of Hotels A 2021 report from City Hall said it was likely that London's population fell during the pandemic. The number of payrolled London employees dropped sharply by about 210,000 by November 2020, with the report citing that flexible work arrangements made it easier to move out of the city. The trend persisted, and by 2022, 43% of commuters lived over 30 minutes away from their workplace in the U.K., reflecting higher property prices in central areas, according to a report by commercial real estate firm CBRE which surveyed over 20,000 people globally.  Additionally, CBRE found that 41% of people worldwide were planning to move to more remote locations in the next two years either in the same city or to a different city. However, in 2025, there's been a sharp recall in remote work offerings with major companies enforcing return to office mandates in London from HSBC to JPMorgan, Amazon, Salesforce and John Lewis. A typically dormitory with roughly a dozen capsules inside Zedwell Capsule Hotel.Sawdah BhaimiyaZedwell's Aziz said one of the hotel's core demographics is young professionals and hybrid workers who are using Zedwell as a \"base in the city\" due to their flexible working patterns which require them to be in the office for a few days a week. Roughly 20% of the hotel's customers are corporate workers, Aziz said. \"The cost of commuting from Oxford, Cambridge, city centers that aren't accessible via the London Underground system, is quite high,\" she said. \"Our product is often cheaper than their commute or late-night travel home.\" The return-to-office mandate has left workers who don't live in cities scrambling to find inexpensive ways of staying in the city, without having to resort to unattractive options like hostels. \"Where they wouldn't traditionally consider a hostel product, we identified that they would indeed consider a capsule hotel, because it gave that privacy,\" Aziz added. As a Londoner, my usual commute to the office lasts just over 30 minutes, so the hotel doesn't offer much in terms of convenience for me, but I can see the appeal for those living further away from the city. When I awoke in the morning, I almost forgot that I wasn't in my bed at home. After a quick shower, I got ready inside my capsule before heading out and joining the throng of commuters in central London. ",

Based on the story, it is likely the apartment has at least two bedrooms, according to Cody Garrett, a certified financial planner at Measure Twice Financial in Houston.Today, a two-bedroom apartment at that location would cost around $2 million, Garrett estimates, with a mortgage payment of around $10,000 per month before taxes, insurance and maintenance.Read more CNBC personal finance coverageTrump promises 'largest tax refund season of all time.'

To rent or buy? New York City Madison Square park view with Christmas lights and Manhattan skyscrapers.Getty ImagesThe question \"Should I buy or should I rent?\" is increasingly relevant today.Renting is cheaper than paying a mortgage in all 50 of the largest U.S. metropolitan areas, according to an April Bankrate study. That cost difference has grown in 38 metro areas in the past year, Bankrate's research found. Yet, New York does not top the list for the biggest difference between renting and buying. Instead, cities including San Francisco; San Jose, California; Seattle; Denver; and Salt Lake City are in the top five. There are reasons why buying can be more financially challenging. Rising home prices have outpaced rent increases in many markets, while mortgage rates have also climbed. Housing supply can also be an issue, with not enough homes available for aspiring purchasers.Emotions may also factor into the buying vs. renting trade-off. For some, buying can offer a sense of security. Others may prefer the reduced responsibility for upkeep that renting provides.\"I actually consider a primary residence to be a lifestyle decision, not an investment,\" Garrett said.To help clients gauge housing affordability, Garrett said he refers to the 28/36 rule. That means no more than 28% of gross monthly income should go to housing costs, and total debt including housing should be no more than 36% of monthly gross income. Monthly homeownership costs are typically measured by PITI — the sum of mortgage principal, interest, taxes and insurance.The fictitious couple Walter and Emily Hobbs in the \"Elf\" movie would need gross income exceeding $450,000 to justify buying the property, according to Garrett. Walter is an executive at a children's book publisher, while Emily also has an unspecified high-level job. Even if they meet that income threshold for home ownership, they may still be squeezed by saving and planning for retirement, Garrett said. Moreover, their son Michael attends York Preparatory school, where annual tuition and fees currently run around nearly $68,000 for grades six through 12.Garrett recently worked with a client who purchased a home in the same neighborhood for around $15,000 per month. Ahead of the purchase, Garrett cautioned the client about how the high home costs could require sacrifice in other aspects of life, including pushing their targeted retirement date later.The \"Elf\" movie has other lessons when it comes to cost of living, particularly for the character Jovie, who works at Gimbels department store and lives in Chinatown.Because it appears she is living paycheck to paycheck, she likely isn't saving for retirement or emergencies, Garrett said, which is common among people who move to New York in search of success. As Leon the snowman tells Buddy when he leaves the North Pole for New York, \"This might be the golden opportunity to find out who you really are.\"Those who move to New York or other big metro areas with similar aspirations may take steps to try to defray the high cost of living, Garrett said. For example, to ease her financial situation, Jovie may find roommates or additional streams of income, he said. ",

Alex Wong | Getty ImagesSeveral of the largest U.S. and European-based drugmakers inked deals with President Donald Trump on Friday to voluntarily sell their medications for less, as his administration pushes to link the nation's drug prices to cheaper ones abroad.That includes Merck, Bristol Myers Squibb, Amgen, Gilead, GSK, Sanofi, Roche's Genentech, privately-held Boehringer Ingelheim and Novartis.

Among the most notable pledges on Friday is that Bristol Myers Squibb will offer Eliquis, its blockbuster blood thinner and top-prescribed product, for free to Medicaid.The companies make up the majority of the 17 drugmakers Trump sent letters to in July, calling on them to lower prices as part of his \"most favored nation\" policy. Trump signed an executive order in May to revive that policy, calling for prices to be increased outside of the U.S. and to \"end global freeloading.\"\"As of today, 14 out of the 17 largest pharmaceutical companies ... have now agreed to drastically lower drug prices for … the American people and the American patients,\" Trump said at an event on Friday. \"This represents the greatest victory for patient affordability in the history of American health care, by far, and every single American will benefit.\"Johnson & Johnson, AbbVie and Regeneron are the remaining companies among the largest that haven't signed drug pricing deals. But Trump noted that Johnson & Johnson \"will be here next week.\" How the drug pricing deals will workThe full terms of the deals were not immediately released, which makes it unclear how broad their impact will be.The nine drugmakers agreed to take measures to reduce U.S. drug prices, including selling their existing treatments to Medicaid patients at the lowest \"most favored nation\" prices, and guaranteeing that pricing for new medicines. Trump said the drugmakers also agreed to list their most popular drugs on his upcoming direct-to-consumer website, TrumpRx, which is launching in January. Some companies also launched new or expanded existing direct-to-consumer offerings for certain drugs. For example, Gilead said in a release that it will launch a program that will enable patients to access its hepatitis C treatment and cure, Epclusa, at a discounted price. Sanofi said it will offer discounts of nearly 70% on certain medicines to treat infections and cardiovascular and diabetic conditions on TrumpRx and other direct-to-consumer platforms. Merck said it will offer three diabetes medications, Januvia, Janumet and Janumet XR, at a roughly 70% discount to cash-paying patients through a direct-to-patient program. That program will be extended to the company's experimental daily cholesterol pill if it gets approved in the U.S., according to the company. \"I reflect on your goal of driving affordability and access to Americans, but equally, getting prices up outside the United States,\" Merck CEO Robert Davis said during the press conference. \"And we're 100% supportive of your actions.\" Meanwhile, Amgen will expand its existing direct-to-patient program to include preventative migraine medication Aimovig and autoimmune treatment Amjevita, at 60% and 80% discounted monthly prices, respectively. Earlier this year, Trump announced agreements with Eli Lilly, Novo Nordisk, Pfizer, AstraZeneca and EMD Serono to sell certain drugs directly to patients at a discount, in exchange for exemptions from his planned pharmaceutical tariffs and other benefits, such as fast-tracked reviews of new drugs. U.S. prescription drug prices on average are nearly three times higher than overseas, according to a 2024 study by Rand Corp. Prices for branded drugs were more than four times higher, the report found. Trump signed an executive order in May to revive the policy of most favored nation, calling for prices to be increased outside of the U.S. and to \"end global freeloading.\"Trade association PhRMA, which represents many major pharma companies, has said that most-favored nation pricing isn't the best way to lower drug costs for Americans and instead blamed pharmacy benefit managers for the price disparity. The U.S. is the single most important market for many drugmakers, regardless of their home country. Despite being based across the Atlantic, European pharma companies are heavily exposed to the U.S. market, with half of the 10 largest companies on the Continent generating a majority of their sales in the U.S.",

    "body": "watch nowHigh home prices, stubbornly high mortgage rates and now less supply are all weighing on potential homebuyers. Sales of previously owned homes rose just 0.5% in November from October and were 1% lower than November 2024, according to the National Association of Realtors. Sales came in at an annualized rate of 4.13 million units.This count is based on closings, so it reflects contracts likely signed in September and October, when mortgage rates initially came down slightly but then stayed in a tight range.   Supply, which had been gaining for much of this year, fell in November. There were 1.43 million homes for sale at the end of the month, down 5.9% from October but up 7.5% year over year, according to the association. At the current sales pace, that represents a 4.2-month supply. A six-month supply is considered balanced between buyer and seller. \"Inventory growth is beginning to stall,\" Lawrence Yun, chief economist for the Realtors, said in a release. \"With distressed property sales at historic lows and housing wealth at an all-time high, homeowners are in no rush to list their properties during the winter months.\"Get Property Play directly to your inboxCNBC's Property Play with Diana Olick covers new and evolving opportunities for the real estate investor, delivered weekly to your inbox.Subscribe here to get access today.Sellers who were on the market also began to delist their properties at a higher rate than usual. Sellers often take unsold homes off the market heading into winter, but that dynamic was much stronger this year. And that is keeping pressure on home prices. The median price of a home sold in November was $409,200, an increase of 1.2% from November 2024, and the highest November reading on record. The Realtors use a median measurement, which can skew to what end of the market is selling most. The high end is currently doing much better than the low end. Sales of homes priced in the $100,000 to $250,000 range were down nearly 8% from a year ago, while homes priced at more than $1 million were up 1.4%.\"Wage growth is outpacing home price gains, which improves housing affordability. Still, future affordability could be hampered if housing supply fails to keep pace with demand,\" Yun said.Homes are staying on the market longer, at 36 days compared with 32 days last November. First-time homebuyers made up 30% of sales, unchanged from a year ago, but historically they make up about 40%. Investors stepped back into the market, making up 18% of transactions, up from 13% in November 2024.",

Juliet, Tennessee, on October 9, 2024.Seth Herald | Afp | Getty ImagesStarbucks announced Friday that it has hired its new chief technology officer, Amazon veteran Anand Varadarajan. Varadarajan, who spent nearly 19 years at Amazon, most recently led technology and supply chain for the tech giant's worldwide grocery stores business.Varadarajan, who also previously held software engineering roles at Oracle, will begin Jan. 19 as executive vice president and CTO, reporting directly to CEO Brian Niccol, according to a memo. The hire comes after Deb Hall Lefevre, Starbucks' former CTO, departed in September as the company underwent a second round of layoffs and announced a $1 billion restructuring plan as a part of its ongoing turnaround. \"[Varadarajan] knows how to create systems that are reliable and secure, drive operational excellence and scale solutions that keep customers at the center. Just as important, he cares deeply about supporting and developing the people behind the scenes that build and enable the technology we use,\" Niccol wrote in a memo announcing the hiring. At Amazon, Varadarajan had recently been elevated to oversee the worldwide grocery technology and supply chain organizations, which include both its homegrown Fresh brand and Whole Foods. He reported directly to Jason Buechel, Amazon's grocery chief and the CEO of Whole Foods. During his tenure, Amazon has experimented further with grocery tech innovations like a pilot to incorporate mini robotic warehouses in Whole Foods supermarkets that enable consumers to shop both its in-store selection and products from Amazon's wider inventory that aren't typically stocked by the organic grocer.Starbucks, meanwhile, is still in the early stages of a turnaround overseen by Niccol, who took over as CEO in September 2024. In the most recent quarter, Starbucks' quarterly same-store sales returned to growth for the first time in nearly two years, a sign that its strategy is winning over lapsed customers. Holiday sales have also been strong so far this season as the company contends with an ongoing strike of unionized baristas impacting a small number of its stores.Part of that strategy is its hospitality platform, Green Apron Service, which at $500 million is the company's largest investment into labor. The program is backed by changes to ensure proper staffing and better technology to keep service times fast. It was born out of growth in digital orders — which now make up more than 30% of sales — and feedback from baristas.watch now— CNBC's Annie Palmer contributed to this report",

    "body": "Chris Ratcliffe | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesTween retailer Claire's is facing legal challenges from some of its Asia-based suppliers over millions in unpaid debts as it tries to emerge from a second bankruptcy under new ownership, according to claims the suppliers filed in Hong Kong. The clash with vendors comes as private equity firm Ames Watson navigates its first holiday season as Claire's new owner and works to ensure it has the right merchandise in stock after buying the mall retailer and about 1,000 of its stores out of bankruptcy for $140 million in September.Since acquiring Claire's, Ames Watson has been trying to rebuild what co-founder Lawrence Berger previously told CNBC is a \"broken business.\" Its bid to get the company back to profitability will hinge in part on a successful holiday season and its ability to stock popular merchandise moving forward. The retailer's sprawling supply chain, made up of longtime vendors equipped to handle the rigorous safety standards governing children's products, has long been considered the company's \"secret sauce,\" former Claire's CEO Ron Marshall told CNBC. Without the support of those suppliers during its first bankruptcy in 2018, the retailer's holiday season would've been a \"nightmare,\" said Marshall, who led the company from 2016 to 2019.The dispute with suppliers adds another challenge for Ames Watson as it tries to fix the long struggling retailer. As the U.S. hits the final days of peak shopping, Ames Watson said \"Claire's has inventory in place for the holiday season.\"A clash over ordersClaire's disputes with its suppliers in Asia surround orders placed in the months before the retailer's second bankruptcy filing in August, when it was still owned by hedge fund Elliott Management and having financial difficulties. Claire's ordering volume for one supplier had dropped by 79% in March and 76% in April compared to the prior year, records reviewed by CNBC show. Then ordering ramped back up to the company's regular cadence in May and June, with volume down only 2% and 3% in those months, respectively, compared to 2024, according to the records.At the time Claire's increased its orders again, the company was running out of cash, considering outright liquidation and looking for a buyer to save its business, according to a declaration Claire's CEO Chris Cramer filed with the court after the company filed for bankruptcy. While the vendors, including those who are now pursuing legal action against the retailer, were aware the company was navigating financial difficulties when the orders were placed, they expected to be paid as they had been during the retailer's first bankruptcy filing, said the people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the discussions were private. watch nowBut by the time the vendors finished manufacturing the body jewelry, nail polish and friendship bracelets Claire's had ordered ahead of the holiday shopping season, the retailer had filed for bankruptcy protection and the vendors weren't paid for some orders, the people said. When Ames Watson acquired the company, some of the vendors who were owed money agreed to keep working with Claire's without getting paid for those debts, concerned they'd lose one of their largest clients and potentially their business, the people said. But others refused, and have taken legal action against Claire's Hong Kong-based sourcing office RSI International, over millions in unpaid debts, according to claims the suppliers filed in the local court. Meanwhile, about a week after Ames Watson announced it would acquire Claire's out of bankruptcy, RSI International filed a notice to transfer its assets to a new entity. The business transfer gave creditors 30 days to file a claim to recoup unpaid debts, after which transferors aren't responsible for the obligations under Hong Kong Law.  In a statement to CNBC, Ames Watson didn't comment on RSI International. It said it was \"not involved in the operation or purchasing decisions made prior to the acquisition.\" \"Since then, we have focused on responsibly stewarding the business and engaging suppliers in good faith as we strengthen Claire's for the long term,\" the company said. \"We are excited about the company's direction in 2026,\" it added.Hedge fund Elliott Management, which owned Claire's at the time the orders were placed, declined to comment.The holiday stakesAt the core of Ames Watson's strategy to revive Claire's is improving its merchandise, which could become more difficult if the company has strained relationships with some suppliers. Compounding the problem is President Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs, which have already strained retail supply chains globally and raised costs for importers. Marshall, Claire's former CEO, said ensuring vendors in Asia got paid during the company's first bankruptcy was key to having the right products in place for the holiday season that year.\"These were suppliers where we had generational relationships and in many cases, represented 30, 40, 50% or even more of their total volume, and the intellectual capital that represented was core to the success of Claire's,\" Marshall said. \"There's a difference between having product on the shelves, which we could have done, and having the right product on the shelves.\"He said the disputes Claire's is having with its suppliers could \"disrupt the supply chain\" both now and moving forward, making a turnaround more difficult. \"There needs to be fresh, novel product to lure [customers] into the store, and if you don't have that continual replenishment of really exciting product, she's gonna pass you by,\" said Marshall. \"This is literally the most fickle customer in the world: an 8-year-old girl.\"",

    "body": "watch nowIntel was once the world's largest semiconductor company, but its market cap plummeted in recent years as the chipmaker fell behind Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. and spent billions of dollars trying to catch up. Now, Intel has entered high-volume production of 18A, the new chip node it says will turn things around.The biggest problem? Convincing a big chipmaker to trust Intel with manufacturing on the new node. For now, Intel's only major customer is itself. The company's long-awaited Core Ultra series 3 PC processor, code-named Panther Lake, will come to PCs in January as the first major product made on 18A.\"It's become an internal node for now,\" said Daniel Newman, CEO of Futurum Group. \"So many companies have made such massive investments into TSMC to ensure yield, to ensure capacity wafers that they just will not make the switch just yet.\"Intel is pinning its hopes of attracting customers on a new chip fabrication plant, Fab52, in Chandler, Arizona, where CNBC got an exclusive on-camera tour in November. Some 50 miles north, in Phoenix, TSMC also has a new fab, where it's making chips with 4 nanometer technology. Its most advanced 2nm tech is currently only made in Taiwan.Intel's 18A is generally on par with TSMC's 2nm node in some metrics such as transistor density. But as Intel works out the kinks after years of delays on previous nodes, some 18A wafers have had defects, making for a lower number of usable chips per wafer, typically referred to as yield.\"Yields are always an issue at the advanced node. This is not an uncommon problem,\" said Harvard Business School professor David Yoffie, who served on Intel's board from 1989 to 2018. He pointed to early yield issues with Nvidia's Blackwell GPUs at TSMC that were quickly fixed.Intel's renewed focus on foundry — manufacturing chips for outside clients — came when Pat Gelsinger took the helm as CEO in 2021. Gelsinger was pushed out last December and replaced by Lip-Bu Tan in March. \"Over the past several years, the company invested too much, too soon – without adequate demand,\" Tan wrote in a memo in July. Intel's campus in Chandler, Arizona, now includes five chip fabrication plants, with Fab52 being the newest addition, shown here on November 17, 2025. Tony PuyolWith Intel awaiting a big outside customer, the U.S. government stepped up in August, taking a 10% stake in the company with an $8.9 billion investment, primarily coming from grants promised under the CHIPS Act signed by President Joe Biden in 2022.Days earlier, SoftBank invested $2 billion in Intel, followed by a $5 billion investment in September from Nvidia, which agreed to use some Intel technology but didn't commit to using its foundry.Here's a look behind the curtain of Intel's new chip factory where it hopes to find major foundry customers and, with them, redemption.Fall of a giantFounded in 1968 by Silicon Valley chip pioneers Robert Noyce and Gordon Moore and legendary investor Arthur Rock, Intel brought the world's first commercially available microprocessor to market just three years later. From the late 1970s through the early 2000s, Intel pumped out increasingly advanced process nodes at a rapid pace, leading to the term \"Moore's Law\" — the doubling of components on a chip every couple years.\"The 1990s was a period of wonder and excitement at Intel,\" Yoffie said. \"We were the world's largest semiconductor company, the world's most profitable.\"But Intel largely missed the mobile revolution, famously turning down a deal to make Apple's processors for the original iPhone. Then came a whiff in AI.In 2024, Intel saw its worst year ever, losing about 60% of its value. The plunge came after two of its previous chip nodes, 10nm and 7nm, were delayed by several years. Analysts say the delays may have been triggered by an earlier choice to hold off on using ASML's costly Extreme Ultraviolet Lithography machines. \"I think we lost the discipline of cycle time,\" said client computing head Jim Johnson, who joined Intel more than 30 years ago. \"Cycle time requires you to commit and deliver, and we started talking ourselves into, hey, we can have longer cycle times and try and lift more or do more.\"As it hustles to get back on track, Intel told CNBC there will be at least 15 EUV machines in Fab52.Intel 18A production manager Lea Tensuan shows CNBC's Katie Tarasov the EUV machines inside Fab52 in Chandler, Arizona, on November 17, 2025.By 2021, TSMC had become the node leader, and Intel began to outsource some leading-edge chip production to the Taiwanese giant. Around the same time, Apple began replacing Intel chips in Mac computers with its own M-series chips, also manufactured primarily at TSMC. In his earlier stint at Intel, more than a decade before rejoining as CEO, Gelsinger \"was given the responsibility to build a GPU to compete with Nvidia,\" Yoffie said. \"Unfortunately, that project failed and that ultimately meant we ended up not playing a significant role in the AI revolution.\"Intel may now be considering a deal to buy custom AI chip design startup SambaNova for $1.6 billion, though the company declined to comment on the matter.'Changing our culture'The trademark of Gelsinger's tenure as CEO was Intel's focus on chip manufacturing. His ambitious roadmap had Intel catching back up to TSMC by releasing five nodes in four years.Now, Tan is CEO and Naga Chandrasekaran is in charge of foundry.\"We are making yield improvements, defect density improvements, month-over-month and hitting our goals,\" Chandrasekaran told CNBC in an interview in November. \"So I believe we have turned the corner.\" Chandrasekaran joined Intel last year after more than two decades at leading memory maker Micron. He said his top goal is finding foundry customers.\"I have to become part of their team and convince them that they can trust Intel Foundry to execute,\" Chandrasekaran said. \"That's number one. And to do that, we are changing our culture. We are bringing a huge execution focus internally into Intel Foundry.\" Chandrasekaran told CNBC that Fab52 is capable of more than 10,000 18A wafer starts per week. There's more than a million square feet of manufacturing cleanroom space in Arizona, with five fabs all connected by 30 miles of overhead track moving wafers between them. A sixth fab, Fab62, is expected to be ready around 2028.18A also uses RibbonFet, Intel's gate-all-around architecture that improves power control by fully surrounding the transistor, unlike previous designs that only contact the top and sides. Chandrasekaran said 18A offers \"more than 15% performance per watt improvement\" over Intel 3.Perhaps the biggest way Intel stands out is in advanced packaging, the assembly and connections of chips onto the final systems where they appear in real-world applications. Intel engineer Shripad Gokhale shows CNBC's Katie Tarasov its next Xeon data center chip in Intel's advanced packaging lab in Chandler, Arizona, on November 17, 2025.Tony PuyolCNBC went to Intel's advanced packaging lab in Chandler to see several steps in the process, such as protecting chips with a polymer-based seal, and exposing them to a liquid that detects any defects. Yoffie said Intel's advanced packaging \"can help mitigate some of the power consumption problems.\"\"One of the biggest problems today for everybody making chips for data centers is the power that it consumes,\" Yoffie said.Chandrasekaran said the Arizona fab is on almost 100% renewable energy. As for water, Intel's Arizona facilities used more than 3 billion gallons in 2024 and returned 2.4 billion gallons to the local supply through a water recycling plant it has on site. 'No blank checks'Tan's message to employees when it comes to spending on future foundry nodes is clear: \"No more blank checks.\" The company needs customers.Intel's big new Ohio chip fab is delayed until at least 2030, and Tan has made major cost cuts by slashing 15% of the workforce in July and axing projects in Germany and Poland.\"That's what the company needed,\"  said Newman of Futurum. \"It needed to be faster. It needed to be leaner. It needed to be more focused. It needed someone that would be a little bit more shrewd.\"Tan is waiting to see how demand shapes up before giving solid details about Intel's next node, 14A.  Chandrasekaran told CNBC it will first be developed in Oregon, with a goal of volume production in 2028.Finding customers for 18A won't be easy. Unlike TSMC which only makes chips for outside clients, Intel also makes devices powered by its chips, positioning it as a competitor to some of the customers it hopes to land. \"If I'm an Nvidia or AMD or Qualcomm or Broadcom, do you really want to put your secret sauce into a manufacturing operation where you're giving Intel access to that secret sauce?\" Yoffie said.He suggests breaking out foundry into a different company.\"If you actually separated the two, I think you'd give Intel a much better shot at being successful,\" Yoffie said. \"And you'd also give the United States a much stronger position for being the home of a major semiconductor manufacturing organization.\"Intel client computing head Jim Johnson gives CNBC's Katie Tarasov an early look at its Panther Lake CPU in Santa Clara, California, on November 12, 2025.Marc GanleyFor now, Intel hopes Panther Lake will be a big proof point when it debuts in PCs from major companies like Samsung, Dell, HP, Lenovo, Asus and Acer in January. Intel's next data center chip, Xeon 6+, is also made on 18A.\"If you're a major company that wants to bet on a process node, you're going to feel a lot more comfortable if you see Intel ramping the heart of their client product line to high volume on that process node,\" Johnson said.Microsoft and Amazon signed early deals last year committing to use Intel's foundry for some of their in-house custom chips.\"It's a good sign, but of course their volumes are very small relative to Nvidia and the other major chip companies,\" Yoffie said.Recent reports suggest AMD is considering manufacturing at Intel, and one analyst predicts Apple may once again make some Mac chips at Intel by 2027.In the meantime, Intel got a lifeline with the U.S. government's 10% stake.\"It shows the confidence that the U.S. government has in Intel and the belief that we need to have leading edge R&D and manufacturing on U.S. soil,\" Chandrasekaran said.The government investment came days after President Donald Trump called for Tan to resign, then reversed course.\"I worry sometimes about the scope creep here and how the U.S. could decide to take stakes in all kinds of things,\" Newman said. \"But you have industries that we have let leave the U.S. to an extent that put us into indefensible risk, and we need to bring them back.\"Some 92% of the world's most advanced chips are made in Taiwan, following a decades-long decline in the percentage of chips made in the U.S.\"The stakes are incredibly high for Intel, for the U.S. and for the world,\" Yoffie said. \"The whole idea that the world's most advanced products are dependent on a single location in an island a few miles off the Chinese coast is a terrible situation for the whole world to have to deal with.\"Chandrasekaran, for his part, is committed to turning Intel into a manufacturer of advanced chips.\"As a semiconductor community, we have to enable this solution for the world to move forward with AI,\" he said. \"There's no other option than to be successful.\" WATCH:  Inside the Arizona chip fab key to Intel's redemption",

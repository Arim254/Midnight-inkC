    "body": "President Donald Trump and Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the de facto ruler of his nation, on Tuesday brushed off questions about bin Salman's involvement in the 2018 killing of the Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul.\"Things happen,\" Trump said when asked about Khashoggi's killing by Mary Bruce of ABC News, as he sat next to bin Salman in the Oval Office. Khashoggi, who was a critic of the regime, was also a U.S. resident.Trump called the ABC News reporter \"fake news\" after she asked about Khashoggi, about claims by families of 9/11 victims that Saudi Arabia bankrolled the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks, and about the propriety of Trump's business investing in Saudi Arabia.\"You're mentioning somebody that was extremely controversial,\" Trump said of Khashoggi.\"A lot of people didn't like that gentleman that you're talking about, whether you like him or didn't like him, things happen,\" Trump said.Referring to bin Salman, Trump said, \"But he knew nothing about it, and we can leave it at that.\"\"You don't have to embarrass our guests by asking a question,\" Trump said.U.S. President Donald Trump (R) speaks during a bilateral meeting with Crown Prince and Prime Minister Mohammed bin Salman of Saudi Arabia (L) in the Oval Office of the White House on November 18, 2025 in Washington, DC. Win McNamee | Getty ImagesBin Salman has denied ordering Khashoggi's killing.But in February 2021, a month after then-President Joe Biden took office, the United States' director of national intelligence released a report that said bin Salman approved an operation to capture or kill Khashoggi.On Tuesday, bin Salman said, \"You know, I feel painful about, you know, families of 9/11 in America. But, you know, we have to focus on reality.\"\"Reality based in CIA documents, and based on a lot of documents that Osama bin Laden used Saudi people in that event, for one main purpose, is to destroy this [relationship], to destroy the American-Saudi relation,\" bin Salman said.\"It's really painful to hear .... anyone that been losing his life for you know, no real purpose or ... not in a legal way,\" bin Salman said, referring to Khashoggi.\"And it's been painful for us in Saudi Arabia,\" the prince said. \"We did all the right steps of investigation ... in Saudi Arabia, and we've improved our system to be sure that nothing happened like that. And it's painful, and it's a huge mistake, and we are doing our best that this still doesn't happen.\"Khashoggi's widow, in a social media post directed at Trump before the meeting with bin Salman, wrote, \"The murder of my husband has caused me to lose everything. There is unfinished business that remains including: the recovery of my husband's body & my rightful compensation as his widow.\"\"Much like the families in Israel, I would like to recover the remains of my husband so that I may have an appropriate religious burial ceremony,\" Hanan Elatr Khashoggi wrote in the post on X. \"And much like the 9-11 families, I am seeking financial compensation for the murder of my husband.\"Hanan Khashoggi separately told CNN in an interview that \"it is very painful for me\" to see Trump welcome bin Salman to the White House.The prince's visit is his first to the United States since Khashoggi was killed.",

    "body": "This photograph shows a general view of Nexperia headquarters in Nijmegen on November 6, 2025.John Thys | Afp | Getty Images The Dutch government on Wednesday said it suspended its intervention at Chinese-owned chipmaker Nexperia, following constructive talks with Chinese authorities.\"We see this as a show of goodwill,\" Dutch Economy Minister Vincent Karremans said in a statement, posted on social media platform X. In a separate letter to parliament, Karremans said it had become clear Beijing now appeared to be permitting companies from European and other countries to export Nexperia chips, adding that \"this is an important step.\"The development appears to bring an end to a bitter dispute between the Netherlands and China, one that had prompted global automotive groups to raise the alarm over a worsening chip shortage. The Dutch economic affairs ministry said the country considered it to be \"the right moment to take a constructive step\" by suspending the order under the so-called Goods Availability Act. It added that it would continue to hold talks with Chinese authorities over the coming weeks.CNBC has reached out to Nexperia, which is based in the Netherlands but owned by the Chinese company Wingtech, and the Chinese embassy in the U.K. for comment. The situation involving Nexperia began in September, when the Dutch government invoked a Cold War-era law to effectively take control of the company. The highly unusual move was reportedly made after the U.S. raised security concerns.In making the decision, the Dutch government cited fears that technology from the company — which specializes in the high-volume production of chips used in automotive, consumer electronics and other industries — \"would become unavailable in an emergency.\"China responded by blocking exports of the firm's finished products.European Union trade chief Maros Sefcovic on Wednesday welcomed the Dutch government's decision to suspend its intervention at Nexperia, saying the move will help to stabilize strategic supply chains. \"Continued constructive engagement with partners remains essential to securing reliable global flows. I stay in close contact with all my counterparts,\" Sefcovic said in a post on X.Shares of Europe's auto giants were trading mixed on Wednesday morning. Milan-listed Stellantis, the parent of Jeep, RAM, Dodge and Chrysler, was last seen up 0.1%.Germany's Volkswagen, Mercedes-Benz Group and BMW, meanwhile, were all trading slightly lower at 11:12 a.m. London time (6:12 a.m. ET). — CNBC's Michael Wayland contributed to this report.",

He is a former president of Harvard University, and Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts told CNN on Monday that the university should sever ties with him. He announced his intention to step back from his public commitments later that day, but said he will continue to fulfill his teaching obligations at Harvard. \"I am deeply ashamed of my actions and recognize the pain they have caused. I take full responsibility for my misguided decision to continue communicating with Mr. Epstein,\" Summers said in a statement to CNBC on Monday.This is breaking news. Please refresh for updates.",

    "body": "Homes in San Francisco, California, US, on Wednesday, Nov. 12, 2025. David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesMortgage rates rose for the third consecutive week, causing demand from both current homeowners and potential homebuyers to drop. Total mortgage application volume fell 5.2% last week compared with the previous week, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association's seasonally adjusted index. The average contract interest rate for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages with conforming loan balances, $806,500 or less, increased last week to 6.37% from 6.34%, with points remaining unchanged at 0.62, including the origination fee, for loans with a 20% down payment. That is the highest level in four weeks.Applications to refinance a home loan, which are most sensitive to short-term moves in rates, fell 7% for the week but were still 125% higher than the same week one year ago. Last year at this time, mortgage rates were about a half a percentage point higher, and refinance volume was unusually low. The large increase from a year ago is more a factor of the very small volumes overall.Applications for a mortgage to purchase a home fell 2% for the week and were 26% higher than the same week one year ago. Purchase demand has hovered around the same level for several months, regardless of interest rate moves.

Mortgage rates have not moved at all to start this week, looking at a separate survey from Mortgage News Daily. \"With only a few exceptions, bonds have been a rudderless ship during the government shutdown. With the backlogged data returning in a slow and uncertain fashion, rudder repairs are similarly slow,\" wrote Matthew Graham, chief operating officer at MND. \"The surprise release of stale jobless claims data did nothing to inspire and there was limited benefit from another negative print in the weekly ADP numbers.\" ",

    "body": "2026 Jeep Recon EVJeepLOS ANGELES — Jeep's new Recon all-electric SUV will start at $65,000, the American SUV brand announced Tuesday when it officially revealed the vehicle.The 2026 Jeep Recon has been years in the making, as the idea of an electric vehicle inspired by the brand's iconic off-road Wrangler SUV was first revealed in 2021. It is expected to begin production early next year at a plant in Mexico.The Recon, revealed Tuesday ahead of the Los Angeles Auto Show, includes familiar, boxy Jeep styling as well as removable doors, a spare tire on the rear and open-air roof — all synonymous with the brand's Wrangler SUV.\"With the Jeep Recon, we're proving that electrification isn't just compatible with off-road excellence, it can elevate it, delivering instant torque, precision control and a quieter, more connected driving experience that's uniquely Jeep,\" Bob Broderdorf, CEO of Jeep, said in a release.2026 Jeep Recon EVJeepThe Recon is part of Jeep's ongoing turnaround plan, which comes after years of sales declines and after several Jeep SUVs were canceled for the U.S. in an attempt to boost profits.The EV is the last of four new or updated products Jeep promised to reveal in four months. The first three were a new Jeep Cherokee hybrid and redesigned versions of the Jeep Grand Cherokee and Grand Wagoneer.\"We're wrapping up the 4x4 – four cars in four months. Recon is the last car to do that. That will complete the storyline,\" Broderdorf said during a media call about the brand's plans to launch a slew of special-edition vehicles next year.The Recon's electric motors combine to produce 650 horsepower and 620 foot-pounds of torque — similar to some V-6 and V-8 sports cars. But that power comes at a cost, with the vehicle getting up to 250 miles of range on a charge, which is lower than many current, less expensive EVs.Read moreThe Recon's price is a roughly $14,000 premium over an entry-level 2025 Wrangler plug-in hybrid electric vehicle and a nearly $27,000 premium over a base 2026 Wrangler four-door. Pricing is in line with the $65,200 Wagoneer S EV, with a range of 294 miles.The Recon comes as Jeep's Stellantis parent company is heavily reducing its investments in EVs following changing market conditions and CEO shake-up in the past year. In the broader market, sales of EVs have plummeted following the end of up to $7,500 in federal incentives in September to purchase a plug-in electric vehicle.Broderdorf said the end of federal incentives is expected to impact sales across the industry, including with the Recon, but the new SUV functions as an EV \"bookend\" alongside the sportier Wagoneer S for the Jeep brand's electric portfolio.\"I'm not going to just chase volume just to chase volume,\" he said during the media call. \"I want to sell cars in the right way. Everybody who wants a [battery-electric vehicle], Recon, I want to make sure that we're there for them. After that, it doesn't really matter to me.\"The Recon is being produced at Stellantis' Toluca Assembly Plant in Mexico alongside the Wagoneer S, Jeep Compass and the new Jeep Cherokee, which is being offered exclusively as a hybrid vehicle.2026 Jeep Recon EVJeepBroderdorf, who started leading the brand in February, said the plant can easily adjust to produce the higher-volume Compass and Cherokee depending on demand for EVs. Both gas-powered vehicles also are expected to be manufactured in the U.S. in the coming years for additional flexibility.\"\"We're going to grow, grow and grow,\" Broderdorf previously told CNBC. \"That's the mission. And do it in a healthy way.\"Jeep's been dealing with a spiraling sales decline that started after the brand reached an all-time high of more than 973,000 SUVs sold in 2018. The brand's sales have fallen 40% since then to less than 590,000 units last year in the U.S.Jeep's sales through the third quarter of this year were up less than 0.5% compared with a year earlier. Jeep's U.S. market share has fallen from 5.4% in 2019 to 3.7% since 2024, according to Cox Automotive.",

Nathan Howard | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesPresident Donald Trump on Tuesday called for ABC's broadcast license to be revoked as he angrily lashed out at a reporter from the network who asked why he has not released files on notorious sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, his former friend.\"I think you are a terrible reporter,\" Trump told ABC News White House correspondent Mary Bruce.The president said he did not like Bruce's \"attitude.\"\"You ought to go back and learn how to be a reporter. No more questions from you,\" Trump said in the Oval Office, where he was meeting with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman of Saudi Arabia.Trump's tirade came shortly before the House of Representatives voted overwhelmingly in favor of a bill to compel the Department of Justice to release all of its records on Epstein.The DOJ earlier this year refused to release those documents, despite prior promises by Attorney General Pam Bondi and other Trump administration officials.Trump does not need to wait for Congress to pass a bill. He could order the DOJ to release more Epstein files.\"Why wait for Congress to release the Epstein files?\" Bruce asked the president. \"Why not just do it now?\"Trump said, \"As far as the Epstein files ...

Because your news is so fake and so wrong.\"\"We have a great commissioner ... who should look at that,\" he added, apparently referring to Federal Communications Commission Chair Brendan Carr, whose agency oversees broadcast licenses.In September, Carr threatened ABC's license over comments by late-night show Jimmy Kimmel about the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk.\"We can do this the easy way or the hard way,\" said Carr on a podcast at the time. \"These companies can find ways to change conduct, to take action, frankly, on Kimmel, or you know, there's going to be additional work for the FCC ahead.\"Hours after Carr's remarks, ABC suspended \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\"The show returned to air about a week later after backlash against ABC and its parent company, Disney.Trump has repeatedly called the Epstein matter a \"hoax\" created by Democrats, even though members of Trump's Make America Great Again movement were leading advocates for releasing the files.And Trump failed to dissuade Republican allies in Congress from supporting the bill to release the files.On Sunday night, as the Epstein bill's chances of passage appeared to rise, Trump suddenly reversed course and urged his GOP allies to support the measure.On Monday, Trump said he would sign the bill if Congress passes it.Trump and Epstein had been longtime friends but had a falling out years before Epstein killed himself in jail in August 2019 after being arrested on federal child sex trafficking charges.Last week, the House Oversight Committee released emails showing Epstein discussing Trump.In one email from 2019, Epstein wrote that Trump \"knew about the girls.\"",

    "body": "A Tesla Inc. robotaxi on Oltorf Street in Austin, Texas, on June 22, 2025.Tim Goessman | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesTesla has obtained a permit to operate a ride-hailing service in Arizona, the state's department of transportation said. The electric vehicle company applied for a \"transportation network company\" permit on Nov. 13, and was approved on Monday, ADOT said in an emailed statement. Additional permits will be required before Tesla can operate a robotaxi service in Arizona.In July, Tesla applied to conduct autonomous vehicle testing and operations in Phoenix, with and without human safety drivers on board. A month earlier, Tesla started a robotaxi pilot in Austin, Texas, with safety valets and remote operators. Tesla also operates a more traditional car service in the San Francisco Bay Area.Tesla didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.Tesla plans to take human safety drivers out of its cars in Austin before the end of this year. The company is aiming to operate a commercial robotaxi service in Phoenix and several other U.S. cities before the end of 2026.According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's website, Tesla cars equipped with automated driving systems were involved in seven reported collisions following the launch of the company's pilot in Texas. Competitors including Alphabet's Waymo in the U.S. and Baidu's Apollo Go in China are way ahead in the nascent robotaxi ride-hailing market. In the Phoenix area, Waymo operates a sizable commercial business, with at least 400 autonomous vehicles, the company previously told CNBC. In May, Waymo said it had surpassed 10 million driverless trips served to riders across the U.S.Baidu said in an earnings update on Tuesday that its Apollo Go service \"provided 3.1 million fully driverless operational rides in the third quarter of 2025,\" representing year-over-year growth of 212%.Musk has been promising that Tesla will \"solve\" autonomy for years without reaching its goals. The world's richest person has continued with the lofty pronouncements. At the company's 2025 shareholder meeting earlier this month, Musk said the \"killer app\" for self-driving technology is when people can \"text and drive,\" or \"sleep and drive.\" \"Before we allow the car to be driven without paying attention, we need to make sure it's very safe,\" Musk said. \"We're on the cusp of that. I know I've said that a few times. We really are at this point.\" WATCH: Baidu to ramp up global exports as robotaxi service grows in Chinawatch now",

David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesZoox on Tuesday began allowing select San Francisco users to hail its driverless vehicles, pitting the Amazon-owned robotaxi service against Alphabet's Waymo in the same market for the first time.Riders can sign up to join the \"Zoox Explorers\" program to take free rides in the company's box-shaped vehicles in certain San Francisco neighborhoods, including SoMa and the Mission and Design districts, the company said.Zoox will take users off the waitlist depending on their location and as it adds more robotaxis to its fleet. The company hopes to remove the waitlist entirely in 2026, Zoox spokesperson Marisa Wiggam said.Founded in 2014 and acquired by Amazon for $1.3 billion in 2020, Zoox is building a robotaxi business that aims to compete with Waymo. But unlike others in the robotaxi space, Zoox's vehicle has no steering wheel, with the company opting to design its robotaxis from the ground up.Zoox notched a major milestone in September when it opened up its robotaxi service to the public for the first time in Las Vegas. The company is offering free rides on and around the Las Vegas Strip while it waits to get regulatory approval for a paid service.The company has been testing its autonomous vehicle technology in San Francisco since 2017 via retrofitted Toyota Highlander SUVs. The company began to deploy its toaster-shaped driverless shuttles on San Francisco streets last year, before allowing friends and family of Zoox employees to hail its robotaxis in parts of the city.Zoox has deployed a fleet of 50 robotaxis between San Francisco and Las Vegas, the company told CNBC in September.Waymo opened up its service to all San Francisco riders in June 2024. Since launching its service in Phoenix in 2020, Waymo has provided more than 10 million paid rides, the company said in May.  Last week, the Google sister company announced that it would begin offering freeway rides in the San Francisco, Los Angeles and Phoenix markets. Waymo also said it was expanding its service to include San Jose and the San Jose Mineta International Airport.As Zoox builds out its service, the Amazon company has deployed its test fleet in Seattle, Austin, Los Angeles, Atlanta and Washington, D.C.WATCH: Amazon's Zoox jumps into U.S. robotaxi race with Las Vegas launchwatch now",

The terms of the company's next round are still being finalized, the person said.Anthropic has committed to purchasing $30 billion of Azure compute capacity from Microsoft and has contracted for additional compute capacity up to 1 gigawatt, according to a blog post. Anthropic has also committed to purchase up to 1 gigawatt of compute capacity with Nvidia's Grace Blackwell and Vera Rubin systems.\"This is a dream come true for us,\" Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said in a video on Tuesday. \"You know, we've admired the work of Anthropic and Dario for a long time, and this is the first time we are going to deeply partner with Anthropic to accelerate Claude.\"Nvidia and Anthropic are collaborating to \"support Anthropic's future growth\" for the first time, the blog post said.

    "body": "Epstein abuse survivor Lisa Phillips speaks during a news conference with lawmakers on the Epstein Files Transparency Act outside the U.S. Capitol on November 18, 2025 in Washington, DC. Heather Diehl | Getty ImagesThe Senate on Tuesday evening agreed to pass a bipartisan bill ordering the Department of Justice to release all of its files on notorious sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, paving the way for President Donald Trump to sign it into law.A senior White House official told the Reuters news service that Trump will sign the Epstein bill \"whenever it gets to the White House.\"The bill will automatically pass the Senate as soon as it is transferred from the House of Representatives, which earlier Tuesday approved the legislation nearly unanimously Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., introduced a unanimous consent motion to consider the bill passed without debate. No senators objected to the motion.The Senate \"has now passed the Epstein bill as soon as it comes over from the House,\" Schumer said with a smile. \"I yield the floor.\"The House bill, brought by Reps. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., and Ro Khanna, D-Calif., had passed 427-1.Rep. Clay Higgins, R-La., the only House member to oppose the legislation, said in an X post after the vote that he has \"been a principled 'NO' on this bill from the beginning.\"\"If enacted in its current form, this type of broad reveal of criminal investigative files, released to a rabid media, will absolutely result in innocent people being hurt,\" Higgins wrote.The push to release the Epstein files had previously faced opposition from more GOP lawmakers, following the lead of Trump, whose White House had warned that backing the effort would be considered a \"hostile act.\"Read more about the Epstein filesHouse overwhelmingly passes bill to release Jeffrey Epstein filesTrump calls to revoke ABC's license over reporter's Epstein files questionJeffrey Epstein files: Larry Summers steps back from public commitments over email falloutJeffrey Epstein victims' ad calls for files to be released, Trump urges GOP to vote for House measureTrump reverses stance on Epstein records, presses Republicans to support releaseJeffrey Epstein on Trump: 'I know how dirty donald is'Trump to ask DOJ to probe Jeffrey Epstein involvement with Clinton, JPMorgan, SummersGoldman Sachs stands by top lawyer Kathy Ruemmler after her emails with Jeffrey Epstein exposedJeffrey Epstein files: House speaker announces vote next week on release of docsWhile Trump, in a major shift on Sunday night, urged House Republicans to vote in favor of the bill, he has continued to fume about the continued focus on Epstein in the media and on Capitol Hill.When ABC News reporter Mary Bruce asked Trump about the Epstein files earlier Tuesday afternoon, he lashed out, repeatedly insulting her and calling for ABC's broadcast license to be revoked.He reiterated that the Epstein matter \"is a Democrat hoax to try and get me not to be able to talk about\" his administration's accomplishments.In a Truth Social post sent around the same time that the Senate agreed to pass the bill, Trump wrote, \"I just don't want Republicans to take their eyes off all of the Victories that we've had.\"Plaskett censure measure follows Epstein billAfter the House's rare display of near-unity, lawmakers resumed fighting along partisan lines, as Rep. Ralph Norman, R-S.C., introduced a measure to censure Democratic Del. Stacey Plaskett of the U.S. Virgin Islands over her connections to Epstein.The Washington Post last week first reported that Plaskett exchanged texts with Epstein during a congressional hearing in February 2019 with Michael Cohen, Trump's former personal lawyer and fixer. Copies of the texts were revealed when the House Oversight Committee released thousands of documents from Epstein's estate. The documents include numerous emails from Epstein discussing Trump.Plaskett, defending herself against the censure measure on the House floor, said that the messages from Epstein were among \"innumerable texts\" she received after one of her remarks in the hearing \"went viral.\"Epstein at that time \"was my constituent,\" and it \"was not public knowledge at that time that he was under federal investigation,\" Plaskett said.Epstein bill gathers momentumA discharge petition that would have forced a vote on the bill earlier was delayed for weeks as House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., kept representatives out of session during the government shutdown. The prolonged absence also delayed the swearing-in of Democratic Rep. Adelita Grijalva of Arizona, the final signature needed to move the petition forward.The shutdown ended last Wednesday and Grijalva, after being sworn in, signed the discharge petition. But, with pressure mounting, Johnson said he would bring the Epstein bill to a vote earlier than expected.WASHINGTON, DC - NOVEMBER 18: U.S. Rep. Thomas Massie (R-KY) (C) speaks during a news conference with Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) and U.S. Rep. Ro Khanna (D-CA) on the Epstein Files Transparency Act outside the U.S. Capitol on November 18, 2025 in Washington, DC. Heather Diehl | Getty Images\"Today, we stand in a moment that will decide whether our government still belongs to the American people, or to those who prey on them,\" said a survivor of Epstein's abuse who spoke alongside a group of others at a news conference outside the U.S. Capitol on Tuesday morning.The survivors were joined by Massie, Khanna and GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, a longtime Trump loyalist who has recently become one of his critics.\"He called me a traitor for standing with these women and refusing to take my name off the discharge petition,\" Greene said of Trump at the presser.\"Today, you are going to see, probably a unanimous vote in the House to release the Epstein files. But the fight, the real fight, will happen after that,\" she said.Johnson said later Tuesday morning that he would vote for the bill, which he acknowledged could get unanimous support. But he nevertheless accused Democrats of \"forcing a political show vote on the Epstein files,\" and spoke at length about his issues with the discharge petition.One of his critiques has been that Epstein's victims may not be adequately protected. Massie, asked earlier Tuesday about Johnson's stance, called it a \"red herring.\"\"The survivors have always been in favor of this legislation,\" he said, noting that the bill instructs the DOJ to redact victims' names and identifying information.Speaker of the House Mike Johnson (R-LA) speaks during a press conference on Capitol Hill on November 18, 2025 in Washington, DC. Johnson addressed the \"Epstein Files\" ahead of a House vote on legislation which instructs the U.S. Department of Justice to release all files related to the late accused sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein. Roberto Schmidt | Getty ImagesTrump, a former friend of Epstein's who had a falling out with him years earlier, said on the campaign trail that he would support releasing the government's files from its investigations into the wealthy and well-connected financier. Epstein died in jail in 2019 while facing federal sex trafficking charges.But Trump's DOJ said in a July 6 memo that it had conducted an \"exhaustive review\" of Epstein-related matters and determined \"that no further disclosure would be appropriate or warranted.\"That determination, and Trump's repeated insistence that the focus on Epstein was a Democratic \"hoax,\" has spurred outrage across the political spectrum, including from some of Trump's own supporters.",

    "body": "The cooling towers of the Three Mile Island nuclear power plant in Middletown, Pennsylvania, Oct. 30, 2024.Danielle DeVries | CNBCThe Trump administration will provide Constellation Energy with a $1 billion loan to restart the Crane Clean Energy Center nuclear plant in Pennsylvania, Department of Energy officials said Tuesday.Previously known as Three Mile Island Unit 1, the plant is expected to start generating power again in 2027. Constellation unveiled plans to rename and restart the reactor in Sept. 2024 through a power purchase agreement with Microsoft to support the tech company's data center demand in the region.Three Mile Island Unit 1 ceased operations in 2019, one of a dozen reactors that closed in recent years as nuclear struggled to compete against cheap natural gas. It sits on the same site as Three Mile Island Unit 2, the reactor that partially melted down in 1979 in the worst nuclear accident in U.S. history.The loan would cover the majority to the project's estimated cost of $1.6 billion. The first advance to Constellation is expected in the first quarter of 2026, said Greg Beard, senior advisor to the Energy Department's Loan Programs Office, in a call with reporters. The loan comes with a guarantee from Constellation that it will protect taxpayer money, Beard said.Constellation's stock was up more than 2% in after hours trading on Tuesday. The control panel in the main control room of the Three Mile Island Nuclear power plant is seen on Oct. 30, 2024 in Middletown, Pennsylvania, U.S.Danielle DeVries | CNBCCEO Joe Dominguez hinted at federal financial support previously, telling investors in Sept. 2024 that Constellation would \"take a look as we finance the project at loan guarantees and other things that will be available.\" Constellation is the largest operator of nuclear plants in the U.S.When asked why Constellation was receiving the loan now, Beard said Tuesday that Constellation could have completed the project without help from the Energy Department. But the loan will help make electricity cheaper for consumers on the grid operated by PJM Interconnection, which serves more than 65 million people across 13 states, Beard said.\"What's important for the administration is to show support for affordable, reliable, secure energy in the U.S.,\" Beard told reporters. \"This loan to Constellation will lower the cost of capital and make power cheaper for those PJM ratepayers.\"Electricity pricesEnergy Secretary Chris Wright said last week that his department's loan office would use most of its money to support the nuclear industry. President Donald Trump signed four executive orders in May that aim to significantly expand new nuclear capacity.Consumers in many states in the PJM region are facing significant electricity price increases as the rapid increase in demand from artificial intelligence data centers outstrips available supply.\"We want to bring as much net addition of dispatchable, reliable electricity onto the grid to stop these price rises in electricity,\" Wright told reporters on Tuesday.The turbine deck of the Three Mile Island Nuclear power plant is seen  on Oct. 30, 2024 in Middletown, Pennsylvania, U.S.Danielle DeVries | CNBCThe Crane Clean Energy Center is one of three shuttered nuclear plants in the U.S. that are aiming to start generating power again this decade subject to approval by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Crane had the capacity to power more than 800,000 homes when it closed in 2019, according to Constellation.The Energy Department is supporting the restart of the Palisades nuclear plant in Michigan with a $1.5 billion loan to Holtec International. NextEra Energy announced in October plans to restart the Duane Arnold nuclear plant in Iowa through an agreement Alphabet's Google Unit.When asked whether NextEra will receive a loan for Duane Arnold, Beard told CNBC that Trump's executive orders direct the Energy Department to \"prioritize the restart of nuclear reactors.\"",

    "body": "watch nowMicrosoft made it easier for corporate workers to make AI agents that go off and do work. Now it's demonstrating a tool that IT specialists can use to see and manage those agents.The software, named Agent 365, provides a list of artificial intelligence agents inside companies' systems, even if they're from other companies, Microsoft announced Tuesday. The company will present the product to business leaders and information technology practitioners at its Ignite conference in San Francisco this week.\"In the same way you provision an identity for a new employee or a contingent worker, you'll provision identity and access controls for your agents,\" Judson Althoff, CEO of Microsoft's commercial business, told CNBC in an interview.With Agent 365, administrators will be able to approve new agents, see which ones are becoming popular and find out how many hours of employee time they're saving each week. They'll also be able to spot security risks and block agents. End users will be able to analyze agents' activities.Following the ascent of OpenAI's ChatGPT in late 2022, software companies have built AI agents capable of developing software, generating ads and performing other simple tasks. Traditional corporations have started buying in.Agents from Adobe, Cognition, Databricks, Glean, ServiceNow and Workday will automatically show up in Agent 365. The software will also display agents that customers have built with Microsoft's Azure AI Foundry and Copilot Studio. Other companies that sell AI agents can integrate with Agent 365, said Ray Smith, vice president of autonomous agents at Microsoft.EY, one of the world's top accounting firms, had built an internal catalog of its AI agents, but has started implementing Agent 365 to gain more control, said Mark Luquire, a managing director for the company.Companies selling cybersecurity software recognize the complexity that might result from agents proliferating. Okta, which sells software for managing access for employees, said in September that it will bring out tools for discovering agents and tracking their activity.Customers enrolled in Microsoft's Frontier program for receiving early access to AI features can request to try Agent 365, Smith said.

    "body": "U.S. Secretary of Education Linda McMahon smiles during the signing event for an executive order to shut down the Department of Education next to U.S. President Donald Trump, in the East Room at the White House in Washington, D.C., U.S., March 20, 2025. Carlos Barria | ReutersThe Trump administration says it will transfer much of the U.S. Department of Education's programs to other agencies, a move experts say is part of President Donald Trump's directive to dismantle the agency.During a press call with reporters on Tuesday, a senior administration official said the administration had signed agreements with four other federal agencies, including the U.S. Department of Labor and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, to begin managing programs currently under the Education Department.Under the new agreements, the Labor Department will administer more federal K-12 initiatives, and the State Department will assume additional tasks related to international education and the Fulbright programs, according to the Education Department.Trump signed an executive order in March aimed at closing the Education Department, which oversees the country's $1.6 trillion federal student loan portfolio, provides funding to low-income students and enforces civil rights in classrooms across the country.Only Congress can unilaterally eliminate the Education Department. But the Trump administration may be trying to use a workaround by contracting with other agencies to perform the department's tasks.\"They are attempting to hollow out the U.S. Department of Education, leaving behind a shell of the original organization,\" said higher education expert Mark Kantrowitz.Earlier this year, the Trump administration laid off nearly half of the Education Department's staffers.\"We'll peel back the layers of federal bureaucracy by partnering with agencies that are better suited to manage programs,\" Education Department Secretary Linda McMahon wrote in a recent op-ed in USA Today.The government shutdown \"underlined just how little the Department of Education will be missed,\" McMahon said.Tuesday's announcement did not include information on the future of the government's student loan portfolio. However, administration officials are exploring options to sell some of the debt to the private market, Politico reported in October.Former President Jimmy Carter established the current-day Education Department in 1979. Since then, the department has faced other existential threats, with former President Ronald Reagan calling for its end and Trump, during his first term, attempting to merge it with the Labor Department.",

It's a scam!\" the Office of the Inspector General for the Social Security Administration said in a recent alert.The scheme involves emails sent with the subject line, \"Alert: Social Security Account Issues Detected.\" An attachment with fake letterhead purporting to represent the SSA OIG warns recipients that their Social Security number may be suspended within 24 hours and that their case may be referred for criminal prosecution.The schemes typically use scare tactics to dupe victims into handing over their money, such as flagging suspicious activity on accounts, claiming personal information is being used to commit crimes, or alleging online accounts or other personal devices have been hacked.Read more CNBC personal finance coverageHow baby boomers can close a retirement savings gapAfter a layoff, don't forget about your 401(k) — it's 'one of your biggest assets,' CFP saysIRS announces 2026 401(k) contribution limits, raises savings capIRS unveils 2026 IRA contribution limits, raises savings capIRS announces 401(k) catch-up contributions for 2026, raises capIRS unveils Roth IRA income limits for 2026What the Visa, MasterCard settlement means for your rewards credit cardWhere SNAP benefits stand amid negotiations to end the government shutdownWhy the AI stock boom mainly benefits the wealthyBoomers are less bullish on ETFs than younger generations — with good reasonTrump floats $2,000 tariff rebate checks: Here's what you need to knowThis is the 'biggest mistake' you can make with your IRA, attorney saysConsumers on edge as ACA 'subsidy cliff' looms: 'Quite frankly, it's terrifying'How to have tricky money talks as a couple: 'Money Together' authorsCNBC's Financial Advisor 100: Best financial advisors, top firms for 2025 rankedWhen recipients of the fraudulent emails call the phone number provided, they may encounter someone impersonating a Social Security Administration employee who sometimes even uses a federal worker's real name. Alternatively, callers may be directed to send a text via an automated message.The SSA OIG, which provides independent oversight of the Social Security Administration, is warning recipients not to share their personal information in response to the notices.\"If you get an unexpected call, text, email, letter, or social media message from SSA OIG or any government agency, pause and think scam first,\" Michelle L. Anderson, acting inspector general, said in a statement. \"The person contacting you may not be who they claim to be.\"      Notably, the SSA OIG \"will never send letters like this,\" Anderson said.Older adults more likely to report scam lossesGovernment imposter scams may also purport to be from other agencies — the Social Security Administration, IRS, Medicare or Federal Trade Commission, for example. Other schemes may claim to represent well-known businesses.In 2024, consumers reported losing more than $12.5 billion to fraud — a 25% increase over the previous year, the Federal Trade Commission reported in March.Investment scams were the most common way to lose money, with $5.7 billion in losses reported by consumers in 2024, followed by imposter scams, with $2.95 billion in losses.Adults ages 60 and over are most likely to report losses of tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of dollars from scams, according to the FTC. The number of older adults who reported losing $10,000 or more to scams went up more than four times from 2020 to 2024, the agency reported in August. In those same years, the number of older adults who reported losing more than $100,000 jumped nearly seven times.watch nowTo avoid becoming a victim, the FTC warns consumers targeted by these types of scams not to send or transfer money to anyone.The agency also recommends independently verifying whether a phone number or website is real and talking to someone you know and trust before transferring money.Blocking unwanted calls can also prevent scammers from contacting you in the first place, according to the FTC.",

    "body": "Global investor sentiment for artificial intelligence remains buoyant, despite on the ongoing stock sell-off.  European and Asia markets have seen days of consecutive losses, tracking their U.S. counterparts lower as pressures mount on AI-related stocks and their valuations. The pan-European Stoxx 600 on Tuesday notched its lowest level in a month, with major bourses opening mixed on Wednesday, while Asia-Pacific markets fell.  Stateside, stock futures were little changed overnight after major U.S. indexes extended their losses. AI-related stocks such as Nvidia, Palantir, and Microsoft are among those feeling the pressure.\"We do think this is an AI specific pullback. We don't think this is the beginning of the bear market,\" Emma Wall, head of investment analysis at Hargreaves Lansdown, told CNBC's \"Squawk Box Europe.\"  When considering whether this is the \"beginning of the end\" or a moment marking \"the big pullback,\" Wall argued that while we are overdue a \"major global market correction,\" the current downturn is yet to bring this shift.Many markets outside of the U.S. — particularly in Europe and the U.K. — already reflect much of the negative news, she said, adding that she sees the pressure as sector specific.watch nowIt is, however, an opportunity to rebalance portfolios, as \"even taking into consideration this week, most people have had a really good run, even in AI stocks,\" Wall said. Mike Wilson, chief U.S. equity strategist and chief investment officer at Morgan Stanley, echoed this sentiment. He said markets have been in a correction for the past six weeks but \"it's not the end of the AI cycle.\" All eyes are on Nvidia, considered the bellwether of AI, as it's due to post third-quarter earnings after the closing bell on Wednesday.  \"Whatever happens tonight is, if it is a blip, is a pullback, it's probably a dip to be bought. But I think we are in the midst of somewhat of a correction right now,\" Wilson told CNBC's \"Inside India,\" adding that he thinks it's the middle-inning. \"The credit part of this spending is just beginning, meaning we're just starting to raise money in the credit markets. It's not like that money is going to sit there and they're not going to spend it, which means there's probably time on the clock with these intermittent kind of pullbacks,\" he added.  watch nowCompanies and investors are engaged in a delicate dance. On one side, AI labs and their partners are making big promises and aggressive plays, according to Jason Thomas, head of global research and investment strategy at Carlyle. \"But it's not incumbent upon investors to believe them,\" he told CNBC's Julianna Tatelbaum, from the firm's annual conference.\"Investors, of course, have to ensure that they are getting compensated for the risk that things don't work out quite as planned, and I think that there's a sense that perhaps there's been some assets in the space that have been priced to best case scenarios. So I think that that's the reassessment that's going on right now,\" he said.Hyperscalers' rising capexThe sell-off comes as the pace of debt dealmaking picks up, fueling speculation that it may have unsettled investors, many of whom have remained bullish on AI as long as companies post sound earnings. Google-owner Alphabet and Meta have issued bonds, for example.  \"It's not a problem, as long as the funding markets are there, meaning they're raising the debt,\" Wilson added. \"I mean, there's investors lined up,\" he said.It does however, become a problem when this is no longer the case, but \"we haven't seen that yet,\" he said.Read moreAI has fundamentally changed the strategy for many Big Tech firms, particularly when it comes to U.S. hyperscalers, which have morphed into capex-heavy companies from once asset-light businesses. Global investors are now assessing this new dynamic. Bank of America's latest Global Fund Managers Survey found that, for the first time in two decades, fund managers are concerned about hyperscalers \"overinvesting.\"\"[Hyperscalers] traded at very high price-to-book ratios, which made a lot of sense. You don't value a money-printing machine based on the cost of the paper or based on the cost of the printing press. And that's essentially what they were, these massive money printing machines where most of their assets were intangible, proprietary technology, the digital platforms,\" said Carlyle's Thomas. \"Now they've actually started to invest so much that 70% of their cash flow is being consumed by capital spending and, if you look at their book value now, 70% actually consists of property, plant and equipment, largely data centers. That's a four-fold increase from a decade ago,\" he added.",

    "body": "The U.S. Capitol, hours before a partial government shutdown is set to take effect, in Washington, D.C., U.S., September 30, 2025. Elizabeth Frantz | ReutersThe largest union representing federal workers on Monday called for Democrats in Congress to end the ongoing government shutdown by voting for the stopgap funding measure that Republicans have proposed.\"It's time to pass a clean continuing resolution and end this shutdown today,\" Everett Kelly, president of the American Federation of Government Employees, wrote.\"No half measures, and no gamesmanship. Put every single federal worker back on the job with full back pay — today,\" said Kelly, whose union represents more than 800,000 federal and District of Columbia government workers.\"Because when the folks who serve this country are standing in line for food banks after missing a second paycheck because of this shutdown, they aren't looking for partisan spin,\" Kelly said. \"They're looking for the wages they earned. The fact that they're being cheated out of it is a national disgrace.\"The shutdown began on Oct. 1, and has led to about 900,000 federal workers being furloughed.Senate Democrats have largely resisted voting for the clean resolution, which would fund the government through Nov. 21, saying they want any funding measure to extend enhanced Affordable Care Act tax credits.Those subsidies, which are due to expire at the end of 2025, lower the cost of Obamacare health insurance plans for more than 20 million Americans.Republicans, in turn, say the fate of ACA tax credits should be addressed only after a funding resolution is passed.At least 60 senators need to vote for such a measure because of the Senate's filibuster rules. Republicans only hold 53 seats in that chamber.In his statement, Kelly did not explicitly address the question of the ACA subsidies, but he seemed to refer to it, writing, \"Reopen the government immediately under a clean continuing resolution that allows continued debate on larger issues.\"\"Both political parties have made their point, and still there is no clear end in sight,\" Kelly wrote. \"Unfortunately, shutdowns have become a recurring tactic in Washington.\"\"But there is no 'winning' a government shutdown. They cost taxpayers billions, hurt small businesses, and erode confidence in government itself,\" he said.",

    "body": "To find out how well a mutual fund or exchange-traded fund has performed over a certain period, you typically look at total return.That number bakes in a few assumptions. Namely, that you put a chunk of money into the fund and let it sit there the entire time, periodically reinvesting any dividends that may have come in.Of course, that's not how real people invest. After you buy a fund, you might end up adding a few more shares if the fund gets hot. Or maybe you sell a chunk if you find another investment you like better.For this reason, even if you've held a fund for a decade, the 10-year return you see on your portfolio page is unlikely to match the official return on the fund's website. And, on average, investors' returns are lower than those of the funds they own.Over the 10 years ended December 2024, the average dollar invested in U.S. mutual funds and ETFs returned an annualized 7%, according to Morningstar's 2025 \"Mind the Gap\" study. Over the same period, those funds returned 8.2%, on average.Put another way, over the course of the decade researchers analyzed, investors lost out on about 15% of their returns.That 1.2 percentage-point difference is what Morningstar researchers call the \"investor return gap.\" In general, it can be attributed to investor behavior, says Jeffrey Ptak, managing director for Morningstar Research Services.\"Literally, it would be buying high and selling low,\" Ptak says.How to narrow your performance gapThe most obvious examples of self-destructive behavior from investors come during market extremes, Ptak says, with over-exuberant investors piling into the market when stocks have already shot up and panic-selling when the market hits the skids.But the kind of behavior that leads to long-term underperformance \"could be much more mundane than that,\" he says. It just may be a coincidence of timing that you buy a fund before a few of its holdings decline in value. Or maybe you sell to raise money for something else, and the fund takes off.Morningstar's data isn't a perfect roadmap for maximizing returns from the funds you own, but it does potentially highlight a few possible strategies for keeping more of the money your funds earn. But remember: Experts recommend talking with a financial professional before making any major changes to your investing strategy.Avoid taking on too much riskAs a rule, investments that come with a higher level of risk also offer higher returns. Among professional investors, this is known as the risk \"premium.\"  But if you have a highly volatile fund in your portfolio, the data shows that you're less likely to realize that fund's full potential.\"More volatile funds are harder for investors to succeed with than less volatile funds,\" Ptak says. \"And that was true even when we were controlling for fund type.\"Across all types of mutual funds and ETFs, investors in the least volatile quintile of funds experienced a return gap of 0.4%, compared with a 2% gap among the most volatile funds.It's impossible to draw a precise conclusion as to why that is, but it's not hard to believe that financial psychology plays a role, Ptak says. Theoretically, the jumpier a fund's performance, the more tempted an investor might be to panic and sell when things get bad.\"Somebody could be following the theory and think, I'll invest in [riskier assets] that pay you a premium return,\" Ptak says. \"That's all well and good, but if you can't hang on, you aren't going to be getting any sort of risk premium. On the contrary, you'll probably have a gap.\"Invest deliberatelyMorningstar's data tends to support the idea that investors who take a hands-off, buy-and-hold approach generally have a smaller gap than people who trade more frequently.Case in point: Among the different types of funds researchers analyzed, allocation funds — which largely consist of target-date funds — produced the lowest investor gap on average, just 0.1 percentage point.The reason for the small gap likely comes down to how these funds, which are designed to grow more conservative as you age, are commonly held: in long-term retirement accounts.The best way to keep your investing gap narrow, Ptak says, is to invest in a diversified portfolio and automate your trading as much as you can to avoid discretionary or emotional trading.\"Less is more,\" he says. \"The less transacting you have to do, the better off you're going to be.\"Want to level up your AI skills? Sign up for Smarter by CNBC Make It's new online course, How To Use AI To Communicate Better At Work.

    "body": "A view of the logo of HSBC bank on a wall outside a branch in Mexico City, Mexico, on June 14, 2024.Henry Romero | ReutersHSBC said on Monday that it will recognize a provision of $1.1 billion in its third quarter results following a court ruling in Luxembourg related to the Bernard Madoff investment fraud case.Herald Fund SPC sued HSBC's Luxembourg unit in 2009, claiming restitution of securities and cash it said were lost in the fraud.The court denied HSBC unit's appeal in respect of Herald's securities restitution claim, but accepted the unit's appeal in respect of the cash restitution claim.The bank will now pursue a second appeal before the Luxembourg Court of Appeal, and added that if unsuccessful, it would contest the amount to be paid in subsequent proceedings.HSBC shares in Hong Kong closed down 1.1%, while its London-listed stock was last trading 1.3% lower.Madoff was described as the mastermind of the largest investment fraud in U.S., defrauding clients of as much as $65 billion. He pleaded guilty in 2009 to a scheme that started in the early 1970s, ripping off more than 40,000 people in 125 countries over four decades, before being caught on Dec. 11, 2008.Madoff, whose victims included director Steven Spielberg and actor Kevin Bacon, was sentenced to 150 years in prison. He passed away in 2021.In its interim report for 2025 released in July, HSBC said Herald had claimed a restitution of securities and cash of $2.5 billion plus interest, or damages of $5.6 billion plus interest from HSBC.HSBC, Europe's largest lender, said that various non-U.S. HSBC companies provided custodial, administration and similar services to a number of funds whose assets were invested with Bernard Madoff Investment Securities.The news comes a day before HSBC is due to announce its results, with the bank saying that the $1.1 billion provision will impact its Common Equity Tier 1, or CET1, ratio by about 15 basis points. The CET1 ratio is a measure of a bank's financial strength, and is used to determine its ability to withstand distress.Estimates from analysts compiled by the bank on Oct. 17 had forecast CET1 ratio for the third quarter to come in at 14.5%, compared to 14.6% in the second quarter.Lorraine Tan, director of equity research for Asia at Morningstar, told CNBC that she does not think that the $1.1 billion charge would have an impact on operations, but it could weigh on sentiment slightly as HSBC was \"hoping that these one-off impairments were cleaned up after the interim write-offs.\"HSBC's allowance for expected credit losses as of June increased by $500 million compared with Dec. 31, including adverse foreign exchange movements of 400 million, and write-offs of $2 billion, according to the bank's interim report.Morningstar's assumption is that HSBC CET1 ratio will be at around 14.4% for the third quarter, and hover at the 14% over the next 10 years.HSBC, which said that the final financial impact from the ruling could be \"significantly different,\" given the pending appeals, is currently undergoing a restructuring under CEO Georges Elhedery, and will see the bank split its operations into four divisions.The bank has said the reorganization will cut costs by about $300 million this year, creating separate \"Eastern markets\" and \"Western markets\" sectors.— CNBC's Marty Steinberg and Scott Cohn contributed to this report.",

    "body": "Gold prices were flat in Asia trade on Wednesday as investors held back from placing large bets ahead of the U.S. Federal Reserve's policy decision, while also keeping a close watch on the developments surrounding the Israel-Iran conflict. Anindito Mukherjee | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesThe narrow lanes of Zaveri Bazaar, one of the oldest jewelers' markets in India's financial capital, Mumbai, grew even more congested this Diwali as crowds jostled to buy gold on the auspicious first day of the festival of lights.But there was a twist.Most of the people thronging the market were there to buy gold coins or bars — not jewelry — Mahavir Kothari, a wholesaler of precious metals in Zaveri Bazaar told CNBC.Leading gems and jewelry trade bodies in India told CNBC that more than 40 tons of gold was sold in the country on Oct. 19, the first day of Diwali.About 700 billion rupees ($8 billion) to 1 trillion rupees ($11 billion) worth of gold was sold during the five-day festival that ended Thursday, according to India Bullion and Jewellers Association, or IBJA, and All India Gem and Jewellery Domestic Council, or GJC.Ajay Chawla, chief executive officer of one of India's largest jewelry chains, Tanishq, reportedly warned his firm could run out of gold coins and bars due to the festive-season demand.A few years ago, out of 10 customers, only one would opt for a coin or gold bar, said Surendra Mehta, National Secretary at IBJA, but this is slowly changing. He added that according to the estimates of his trade body, sales of jewelry had dropped by about 30% this festive season compared to last year.The enthusiasm among Indians over buying gold for investments has been rooted in their search for returns. Gold this year had risen 66% by mid-October, before seeing a sharp slide — it was still up 55% as of Monday. Earlier this month, gold prices smashed past $4,000 an ounce, with some industry experts forecasting the yellow metal to touch $5,000 in 2026.India is the second largest purchaser of gold after China, according to data from the World Gold Council, which shows the country has been a consistent buyer for years, driven by traditional demand for gold during the festive (October) and wedding seasons (October to mid-January and April to May).Gold jewellery in a shop in Kolkata, India.Sonali Pal Chaudhury | Nurphoto | Getty ImagesAs global central banks increase their gold purchases, fueling a surge in prices, the yellow metal is increasingly attracting retail investors who fear missing out on the boom.Goldman Sachs in a report on Sept. 30 said that central banks, particularly in emerging markets, have increased their pace of gold purchases by roughly fivefold since 2022, when Russia's foreign-currency reserves were frozen following its invasion of Ukraine.\"We view this as a structural shift in reserve management behavior, and we do not expect a near-term reversal,\" the report said.These sharp gains in gold prices are making Indians see gold not just as a consumption product, but a key investment asset, experts said.Earlier, when gold demand was largely driven by consumption and prices of jewelry rose, consumers would cut back on spending, said Anindya Banerjee, head of commodity and currency markets at Kotak Securities. But elevated prices have not curbed the overall demand for gold this festive season.Rajesh Rokde, chairman of GJC said that volume-wise sales for all five days of Diwali were just about 5% lower compared to last year, despite significantly higher prices.Gold currently trades at $4,073 per ounce.\"India's households wealth held in gold is estimated at $3.8tn/ 88.8% of GDP,\" said Morgan Stanley in a report on Oct. 9. \"This is providing a positive wealth effect, even as benign macro stability ensures that flow of gold demand remains range bound,\" it added.Gold is a good hedge against falling rupee and any weakness in Indian equity markets, said Mukesh Jindal, senior partner at wealth management firm Alpha Capital that handles assets of more than 100 billion rupees for family offices and high net worth individuals in India.Investments include purchasing gold bars, coins, exchange traded funds and even digital gold. In September, inflows into gold ETFs rose more than six-fold to (83.63 billion rupees) from a year earlier, according to data from the Association of Mutual Funds in India.The rally in gold is likely to continue as central banks across the world remain net buyers of the metal month on month, Jindal said, adding that he has been advising clients to allocate 5%-10% of their portfolio to gold. That is still conservative compared to Bridgewater Associates' founder and billionaire Ray Dalio's advise earlier this month of allocating as much as 15% of one's portfolio to gold.",

Novartis and Avidity didn't immediately respond to CNBC's requests for comment.Avidity specializes in developing an innovative class of ribonucleic acid (RNA) therapeutics called antibody oligonucleotide conjugates. RNA-based therapeutics are a relatively new class of medications that work by altering how genes are expressed to treat or prevent diseases.The Avidity deal comes as Novartis ramps up its research and development division. The company earlier this year pledged to invest $23 billion to build out its U.S.-based infrastructure, which includes plans to construct a second R&D hub in San Diego.The pharmaceutical giant has also struck two key deals with Anthos Therapeutics and Regulus Therapeutics this year to boost its development and manufacturing of cardiovascular and kidney disease drugs.Avidity shares closed at $49.15 on Friday. The stock, which has a market capitalization of roughly $7.2 billion, is up nearly 70% since the beginning of the year. Novartis shares closed at $130.36 on Friday.",

Then one thing led to another and I was CEO for 13 years and I just found it quite exhausting.\"He added: \"I'm an introvert, I had to just kind of put on this face day after day and then in the beginning I was like, 'Oh, it's going to get easier, the company will get more mature,' and then the world just kept getting more chaotic — the first Trump presidency and the pandemic and all the race stuff, it made it just a lot less of the company building, being a CEO is a lot more reacting to problems and doing this sort of thing.\"Many famous leaders are introvertsVarious notable business leaders have described themselves as being introverts, from Meta's Zuckerberg, to Microsoft's co-founder Bill Gates, and chairman and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway Warren Buffett.Susan Cain, author of \"Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking\" said introverts are often passed over for leadership positions and thrive more in quieter and less stimulating environments.She said introverts have some hidden traits that can make them well suited for leadership positions, including taking fewer risks, being more creative, and being better at problem solving.Cain said that introverted leaders can be \"slow\" and \"circumspect\" when making decisions which helps them to avoid impulsive or reckless moves.They also tend to seek out solitude more which is \"a real catalyst to creativity,\" according to Cain.\"This two-tier structure of how we view personality leads to a colossal waste of talent, and of energy and of happiness,\" Cain said. \"We need to be adopting much more of a yin and yang approach of balance between the two styles.\"",

Kevin Lamarque | ReutersRussia's testing of an \"invincible\" nuclear-powered cruise missile with a potentially \"unlimited range\" has been met with a less-than impressed response from U.S. President Donald Trump as a new cold front opens up between the countries.Russia announced Sunday that it had successfully tested a new nuclear-powered cruise missile, the 9M730 Burevestnik (or 'Storm Petrel'), on Tuesday last week.It boasted that the missile, which can carry conventional or nuclear warheads, and code-named 'Skyfall' by NATO, can change direction mid-flight and move vertically and horizontally, meaning it can evade missile and air defense systems.President Trump, who's undertaking a whirlwind tour of Asia and is also set to meet Chinese President Xi Jinping on Thursday, was not impressed with the missile launch, telling reporters Monday that Putin should focus on ending the war in Ukraine instead.\"I don't think its an appropriate thing for Putin to be saying, either, by the way: You ought to get the war ended, the war that should have taken one week is now in ... its fourth year, that's what you ought to do instead of testing missiles,\" Trump told reporters on Air Force One on Monday.U.S. President Donald Trump looks on next to people waving Malaysian national flags before he departs on Air Force One from Kuala Lumpur International Airport in Sepang on Oct. 27, 2025.Andrew Caballero-Reynolds | AFP | Getty ImagesHe also denigrated the use case for the Russian missile, stating that the U.S. did not need a weapon that could fly so far as it had a nuclear submarine off the coast of Russia.\"They know we have a nuclear submarine, the greatest in the world, right off their shores, so I mean, it doesn't have to go 8,000 miles,\" Trump said, according to an audio file published by the White House.\"They're not playing games with us and we're not playing games with them either,\" Trump added. \"We test missiles all the time.\"The Kremlin responded to that on Monday by saying that \"Russia is consistently working to ensure its own security. It is in line with this objective that the development of new weapons systems, including the aforementioned [Burevestnik] system, is taking place,\" Putin's Press Spokesman Dmitry Peskov said, in comments reported by Russian state media agency TASS.\"Russia must do everything possible to guarantee its own security,\" Peskov added.Test carefully timedThe timing of the test does not appear to be accidental, taking place on the same day that Russia was left humiliated and sidelined after Trump cancelled upcoming talks that were due to be held with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Hungary.Eager to flex its military muscle, and likely a warning to Trump who has been considering whether to give Ukraine long-range Tomahawk missiles capable of striking targets deep within Russia, Moscow declared on Sunday that it had successfully tested its Burevestnik missile.During the test, the missile travelled 14,000 kilometers (or 8,700 miles). It was in the air for about 15 hours and this was \"not the limit,\" Valery Gerasimov, chief of the general staff of Russia's armed forces, told Putin on Sunday, in comments reported by TASS.Putin applauded the test as he visited a command post for troops fighting in Ukraine, where he was briefed on the frontline situation, the Kremlin said in a statement on Sunday.Putin told military officials that such missiles were \"unique products, unmatched anywhere else in the world,\" in comments translated by AP.Russia's President Vladimir Putin and Chief of the General Staff Valery Gerasimov.Grigory Sysoyev | Afp | Getty ImagesRussia says such missiles are part of its nuclear deterrence, with Putin stating Sunday that the country's \"nuclear deterrent is at the highest level. It's probably no exaggeration to say that it's at least higher than that of all nuclear states.\" He added, however, that Russia would now work to put such weapons \"on combat alert.\"On the same day that Russia basked in an apparent show of strength, the Kremlin warned that any strikes inside Russia would be met with an \"overwhelming\" response.Souring relationsRelations between Washington and Moscow took a turn for the worse last week after the White House announced that s planned meeting between Putin and Trump would be postponed indefinitely as the White House leader said he didn't want to \"have a wasted meeting.\"Trump added that the in-person summit was canceled because \"every time I speak to Vladimir, I have good conversations and then they don't go anywhere.\"The announcement was met with a stony silence from the Kremlin as senior Russian officials blamed Western media and \"fake news\" for the abandoned talks, which had been previously been lauded by Russian state media as a coup for Moscow as it vies with Ukraine for Trump's ear, and support.",

    "body": "U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent speaks to reporters at the White House in Washington, D.C., Oct. 22, 2025.  Kevin Lamarque | ReutersTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Monday confirmed that the list of candidates to replace Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has been winnowed down to five, and President Donald Trump said the replacement is likely to be named by the end of the year.Speaking to reporters on Air Force One, Bessent said the finalists are current Fed Governors Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman, National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett, former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh, and BlackRock executive Rick Rieder, according to several media outlets.Those names were reported earlier this month by CNBC.Bessent, who had been rumored to be a top candidate as well, said he has been conducting interviews and that he expects to do one more round before presenting a \"good slate\" to Trump after the Thanksgiving holiday.Trump, also speaking to reporters Monday on Air Force One, said he anticipates naming a replacement by the end of the year. Powell's term doesn't expire until May. Powell then can either step down from the Fed entirely or continue serving a term as governor that lasts until 2028.The Federal Open Market Committee meets this week, with an interest rate decision due Wednesday. Markets are pricing in a near certainty that the committee will lower its benchmark overnight borrowing rate by a quarter percentage point, which would follow a similar cut in September.Trump has three appointees on the seven-member board of governors: Waller and Bowman, as well as Stephen Miran, who is filling an unexpired term that ends in January. Miran, who was confirmed in September as the head of the Council of Economic Advisers, is not expected to be reappointed. He has campaigned for the FOMC to be more aggressive in easing.Should Powell opt to leave the Fed, that would give Trump four appointees. Trump thus far has been unsuccessful in trying to remove Governor Lisa Cook from the board. A rotating cast of five regional presidents joins the governors as voters during the FOMC meeting.",

    "body": "Employees work on the assembly line of new energy vehicles at a factory of Chinese EV startup Leapmotor on April 1, 2024 in Jinhua, Zhejiang Province of China.Shi Kuanbing | VCG | Visual China Group | Getty ImagesChina's industrial profits soared 21.6% in September from a year ago, the National Bureau of Statistics said Monday, as Beijing's campaign to curb price wars helped ease pressure on manufacturers despite persistent trade tensions with the U.S.That sharp jump, extending a strong rebound that began in August when the industrial profits jumped 20.4% year-on-year, marked the biggest gain since November 2023.For the first nine months of the year, profits at major industrial firms grew 3.2%, the official data showed, accelerating from a 0.9% rise in the January to August period.The rebound in corporate profitability was largely helped by Beijing's policies aimed at curtailing fierce price competition across industrial sectors, at a time when deflation in producer prices stretched into its third year. China's consumer prices fell more than expected in September, slipping 0.3% from a year earlier, while the producer price index slumped 2.3%.Profits for the manufacturing sector jumped 9.9% from a year earlier in the January to September period, and earnings from electricity, heat, fuel and water supply companies climbed 10.3%. The mining sector, however, saw profits drop 29.3%.Yu Weining, chief statistician at NBS, said high-tech manufacturing helped drive broader profit growth, with sector earnings surging 26.8% in September.Among industrial firms, profits at state-owned enterprises dipped 0.3%, compared with gains of 4.9% for foreign industrial firms — including those with investment from Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan — and 5.1% for private companies.Chinese manufacturers have weathered uncertain trade policies with the U.S. and tepid consumer confidence at home as the world's second-largest economy grappled with a prolonged housing downturn, weak labour market conditions and growing headwinds on its exports.While the country's overall exports have remained resilient this year, analysts expect the trade growth to slow in the final quarter, in part due to the high base last year.\"We expect export growth to slow in Q4, after an increase to 6.6% y-o-y in Q3 from 6.2% in Q2, due to a high base and rising trade barriers globally,\" said a team of economists at Nomura.China's economy expanded 4.8% in the third quarter, marking the slowest rate in a year. Fixed-asset investment unexpectedly contracted 0.5% in the first nine months of the year — the first such decline since 2020 during the pandemic — according to data going back to 1992 from Wind Information.Industrial output grew faster than expected in September, climbing 6.5% from a year ago, and up from 5.2% growth in the previous month.The resilient headline figures suggest Beijing may not see much urgency in rolling out more stimulus measures to achieve its growth target of around 5% for this year, analysts said.While Chinese policymakers pledged to boost domestic demand at a high-profile economic planning meeting earlier this month, they also stressed the need for technological breakthroughs and for upgrading the country's industrial capabilities.\"References to 'expanding domestic demand' and 'improving livelihoods' are present but comparatively much less prominent,\" said Louise Loo, head of Asia Economics at Oxford Economics.\"These suggest that while policymakers recognise weak household sentiment and a savings overhang, they don't envision large-scale consumption stimulus over the next five years,\" Loo added.",

    "body": "Saudi Arabia is primed to become a hotspot for artificial intelligence infrastructure thanks to its surplus in energy, according to Groq CEO Jonathan Ross.The Middle Eastern country is known for its vast energy resources and that's leading major technology firms to announce infrastructure deals in the region. It is also part of the kingdom's Vision 2030 strategy, which is a plan to diversify the Saudi Arabian economy beyond oil.Jonathan Ross, the co-founder and CEO of AI chip company Groq, told CNBC's Dan Murphy in an interview at the Future Investment Initiative (FII) conference in Riyadh, that Saudi Arabia can become a net exporter of data thanks to its surplus in energy.\"One of the things that's hard to export is energy. You have to move it, it's physical, it costs money. Electricity, transporting it over transmission lines is very expensive,\" he said.Data, in comparison, \"is very cheap to move,\" Ross, who previously worked on AI chips at Google's parent company Alphabet, added. \"So since there's plenty of excess energy in the Kingdom, the idea is move the data here, put the compute here, do the computation for AI here, and send the results.\"\"What you don't want to do is build a data center right next to people, where it's expensive for the land, or where the energy is already being used. You want to build it where there isn't, where there aren't too many people, where the energy is underutilized. And that's the Middle East, so this is the ideal place to build out.\"watch nowThe Middle East could see $320 billion worth of gains thanks to AI, according to PwC, and Saudi Arabia is looking to capitalize on that by putting AI at the heart of its economic strategy.The CEO of the state-backed AI and data center company Humain, which is also working with Groq, previously told CNBC that it's ambition is to become the \"third-largest AI provider in the world, behind the United States and China.\"Saudi Arabia faces stiff competition competition, however, with the United Arab Emirates leading the region's progress thus far. PwC expects AI to contribute $96 billion to the UAE economy by 2030, or 13.6% of GDP, while Saudi Arabia could see $135.2 billion, or 12.4% of GDP, from AI over the same time frame. If those figures come to fruition, it would put Saudi Arabia in fourth place, behind its neighbor, on the global AI leaderboard.However, data centers run hot and typically need a lot of water for cooling, which poses critical questions around the suitability of an arid and hot country like Saudi Arabia housing such infrastructure. It has also long experienced a digital skills shortage and AI talent will likely be no exception, though the government has championed the upskilling of citizens.Those challenges haven't yet slowed down the slew of AI-related announcements. Groq is working with Aramco Digital, the digital and technology arm of Saudi Aramco, to build what it has dubbed the \"world's largest inferencing data center.\"Its chips, made in upstate New York, per Ross, are specifically designed for putting AI to use, which is known as inference.Earlier this year, the California-based technology company secured $1.5 billion in investment from Saudi Arabia to its expand its efforts. It is also supporting the development of the Saudi Data and AI Authority's own large language model.\"It's optimized for interfacing with the kingdom, so if you need to be able to ask about something here, it has all the data that you need to get the appropriate answers. Whereas other LLMs haven't been tuned, they don't have access to a database that's as rich with information about the local region,\" Ross said.Localized data is a hot topic as countries around the world look to make use of AI but may not receive relevant results from models trained on English-language data sets from industrialized countries.",

Exact date and location unknown.AP PhotoThe mystery donor whose $130 million contribution is meant to pay U.S. military troops during the government shutdown is Timothy Mellon, an heir to a renowned Gilded Age banking family, The New York Times reported Saturday.But Mellon's donation works out to only about $100 per service member. It costs nearly $6.4 billion to pay U.S. troops every two weeks.And using his money might run afoul of federal law, according to the Times, which cited two people familiar with the matter in identifying the billionaire railroad magnate as the donor.When President Donald Trump announced the donation at the White House on Thursday, he did not identify the man by name, but described him as a \"great patriot\" and a \"friend of mine.\"\"And he's a big supporter of mine,\" Trump told reporters on Friday night. \"He's a wonderful man, and he doesn't want publicity.\"Mellon has an estimated net worth close to $1 billion, according to Forbes.But in an email to the news outlet in 2024, Mellon wrote, \"Billionaire NOT! ...

    "body": "European consumers are facing higher prices when going to the supermarket.Andia | Universal Images Group | Getty ImagesRelations between the the U.K. and European Union are arguably at the best they've been since the Brexit vote in 2016 but there's an ongoing cold front between the neighbors over a ban on continental cheese and meat imports.In April, Britain banned people from bringing all dairy products and a range of meats from the EU into the country for personal consumption, saying the prohibition was needed in order to prevent the possible spread of Foot and Mouth Disease among British livestock after outbreaks in Europe earlier this year.British holidaymakers travelling to the continent were warned not to bring home foodstuffs such as cheese, chorizo, Serrano ham or sandwiches containing any of a wide range of banned products, even if they were sealed or bought in duty-free shops at airports. The ban extends to cakes, biscuits and chocolate containing a high level of unprocessed dairy products or fresh cream.Those found with banned items were told they'd have to surrender them at the border, or have them seized and destroyed. Anyone flouting the restriction could receive a £5,000 fine (around $6,700), the government said.The Brits' ban did not apply to commercial food imports because they undergo more stringent biosecurity requirements, such as heat treatment and veterinary health certificates, the U.K. said.Cheese shops in Paris — and particularly those situated around the Gare du Nord where Eurostar trains travel to and from the U.K. — say the restrictions have hit sales to a vital customer base.\"Tourists are very important, and especially English people,\" Alexandre Vilaca, founder and manager of Fromagerie Ferdinand in Paris, told CNBC, noting that when he opened his cheese shop eight years ago, he had chosen the Gare du Nord neighborhood for its international visitors.\"These past few years, it was very important to have English clients. We vacuum-packed the cheese so they could travel easily to the U.K., and we started to have regular clients who used to pass by our shop in order to bring some gifts to the families and friends ... But a few months ago, clients told me that it was forbidden to bring cheese back home,\" he said.\"And it's had a huge impact on our sales to U.K. clients,\" he added.A cheesemonger working in a cheese store in Paris, France, in 2022. Bloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesVilaca said the ban was largely nonsensical, given that the French authorities were \"very, very strict\" about sanitary controls and regular checks on cheese producers, their products and their distribution. English cheese producers Vilaca worked with were also upset by the ban, he noted.\"We are proud when clients take home some souvenirs, maybe some wine, some cheese — a bit of France in their bags, so to speak. So we don't understand [the ban], we are quite upset and it is bad news because, in terms of business, it's not great.\"Why the ban?Temporary bans on continental food products entering or exiting the U.K., or vice versa, are nothing new and it's worth noting that the EU introduced a permanent ban on Brits bringing animal and dairy products, for personal consumption, into the bloc following Brexit for the same reasons: to prevent the spread of diseases.Foot and Mouth Disease, or FMD, is a serious concern for a close-knit continent like the EU as it can spread very quickly, particularly given the region's interconnected agricultural market and multiple transmission routes.FMD does not pose a risk to humans but is highly contagious to cattle, sheep and pigs, with the disease able to spread rapidly among livestock, with devastating consequences.Outbreaks of FMD were confirmed in Germany, Hungary and Slovakia earlier this year but they were contained after the countries' rapidly implemented animal health control measures in the affected establishments, including the culling of livestock and protection and surveillance zones.Not taking any chances: Cars pass through at a disinfection checkpoint set up on the border crossing between Hungary and Slovakia on March 28, 2025 in Medvedov, Slovakia. The country declared a state of emergency after several cases of foot and mouth disease in the region, including a new outbreak detected in Hungary, close to the Slovak border near Bratislava.Robert Nemeti | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesThose emergency measures were lifted after Germany was declared free of FMD in April, and Hungary and Slovakia have seen no new outbreaks since April.In late July, the U.K. government's Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs (Defra) said in an assessment that \"while the incursions of FMD into Europe earlier in the year were undoubtedly concerning, there have been no further reports since April, suggesting that the situation in Hungary and Slovakia is under control.\"While the report's authors said the risk of incursion of FMD to the U.K. was, in July, was considered a 'low (rare but can occur)' risk, the report cautioned that FMD can remain undetected for several months.The U.K. government told CNBC that, despite the containment of European FMD outbreaks, the ongoing ban on personal imports of cheese and many meats aimed to protect British farmers and U.K. food security.\"Earlier this year, we took immediate action to ban personal imports of meat and dairy from Europe after a wave of foot and mouth cases. We are also investing £1 billion [$1.3 billion] in a new National Biosecurity Centre to boost our world leading facilities and protect our farmers, food supply and economy,\" a spokesman for Defra told CNBC.\"We will do whatever it takes to protect our farmers from animal disease,\" the spokesperson added.Almost six months into the ban, however, and questions are being asked whether the ongoing restrictions are excessive, and no longer necessary.Defra stressed its not alone in implementing the current restrictions, and is only doing what the EU has been doing for several years, since Brexit, as standard practice.Asked when the ban might be lifted, given that cases of FMD are now contained on the continent, Defra said the government's \"FMD response remains under constant review\" and that it will \"retain restrictions in England while personal imports of affected products pose biosecurity risks to Great Britain.\"Hard lessonsThe U.K. and EU have learned the hard way what an outbreak of FMD can cause.Cows of Breier Cattle Farm are pictured at a farm near Budapest on March 11, 2025. Hungary detected its first foot-and-mouth disease outbreak in over 50 years on March 7, 2025, at a cattle farm near the Slovak border. The country's food safety agency, introduced extremely strict measures to prevent the further spread of the disease, including a ban on the movement of susceptible species. Ferenc Isza | Afp | Getty ImagesThe 2001 epidemic, which first broke out in the U.K. before spreading to the continent, had a devastating impact on the British farming community with over six million animals having to be destroyed and estimated to have cost the U.K.'s public and private sector a combined £8 billion.In the EU, four million animals were destroyed and the outbreak is estimated to have cost member states 2.7 billion euros in terms of eradication measures and compensation to farmers.The U.K.'s last outbreak, in 2007, only affected eight farms but was estimated to have cost £147 million overall, due to large-scale livestock movement bans.",

    "body": "Students walk around the UCLA campus on Tuesday, Oct. 7, 2025 in Los Angeles, CA. Juliana Yamada | Los Angeles Times | Getty ImagesMillions of borrowers once again have access to student loan forgiveness — but they may need to take action to ensure they qualify.The U.S. Department of Education will resume cancelling the debt of eligible borrowers enrolled in the Income Contingent Repayment plan, or ICR, and the Pay as You Earn plan, or PAYE, according to an agreement reached by the American Federation of Teachers and the Trump administration.Earlier this year, the department had stopped cancelling the debt of borrowers in those two plans, citing a court order. Read more CNBC personal finance coverageWhat student loan borrowers need to know, as forgiveness resumes under two plansAmericans face a retirement 'confidence paradox': How to gauge readinessGovernment shutdown curtails nonprofit funding, putting services in jeopardyMore investors are interested in alts — advisors say there's an easy way inHere's the inflation breakdown for September 2025 — in one chartInherited IRAs have a key change for 2025.

The agreement may allow more of those borrowers to qualify for forgiveness. But it's a limited window.President Donald Trump's \"big beautiful bill\" will phase out ICR and PAYE as of July 1, 2028. The Education Department has only agreed to resume the relief while ICR and PAYE remain in effect.Here's what borrowers need to know about the resumed loan forgiveness under ICR and PAYE.3 plans lead to student loan forgivenessBoth ICR and PAYE are income-driven repayment plans, meaning they cap a borrower's bills at a share of their discretionary income and lead to loan forgiveness after a certain period; ICR in 25 years and PAYE in 20 years.Borrowers have had access to debt cancellation under ICR since 1994, and under PAYE since 2012.Student loan borrowers also have access to forgiveness under the Income-Based Repayment plan, or IBR.When the Education Department curtailed forgiveness under ICR and PAYE earlier this year, officials said they were responding to a February court order that blocked a Biden administration-era repayment plan, known as the Saving on a Valuable Education plan, or SAVE. The officials said that the ruling had implications for other repayment plans, although ICR and PAYE have both been available for over a decade.Consumer advocates and the American Federation of Teachers, a union representing some 1.8 million members, disagreed with the administration's interpretation of the ruling and said that the agency was required to offer debt forgiveness under the well-established programs. In its March lawsuit, the AFT accused Trump officials of blocking borrowers from the relief programs mandated in their loan terms.Borrowers in ICR, PAYE can stay put for nowBefore the AFT and Education Department reached their agreement, student loan borrowers who'd accumulated enough credit to get forgiveness under ICR or PAYE would have needed to transfer to IBR to get their loans discharged, said Nancy Nierman, assistant director of the Education Debt Consumer Assistance Program in New York.\"Now, they don't have to do that,\" Nierman said. \"They can remain in these plans and realize forgiveness.\"Borrowers who want to cancel a submitted request to switch into IBR can try calling the Federal Student Aid Information Center at 1-800-4-FED-AID, Kantrowitz said. You might also try contacting your student loan servicer to cancel your request.Prepare for a future repayment plan switchOnce PAYE and ICR are phased out, borrowers in those plans who still haven't yet become eligible for debt erasure will need to switch to a repayment plan that still offers loan cancellation. The payments you've made under PAYE and ICR will count on your timeline to the relief, Nierman said.Borrowers should keep records of the payments they have made, to make sure they don't lose any qualifying months.One important point to note: Continued access to IBR will be available only to those who borrowed before July 1, 2026. Loans taken out after that date will void eligibility for IBR.Due to recent legislation, borrowers after that date will be able to enroll in only a new income-driven repayment plan, called the \"Repayment Assistance Plan,\" or RAP, or a revised Standard Plan.",

The tech factors in the length of a stay, the distance from a guest's location, property type and timing of a booking to block reservations deemed \"higher risk.\"\"We lead the way in proactive measures to reduce the risk of unauthorized parties, and our heightened technology for Halloween is one important layer in a comprehensive suite of policies and tools to support hosts, guests and local communities, and promote responsible travel,\" the company wrote in a release.This isn't the first time Airbnb has attempted to block parties during holidays.Last year, the company said it prevented about 38,000 people in the U.S. and 6,300 in Canada from making bookings during Halloween weekend. The company has also used the tech during New Year's Eve and summer holidays like Memorial Day and the Fourth of July.Airbnb said the rate of parties reported worldwide has dropped by 50% since it implemented a ban on parties and events in 2020 to curb the spread of Covid. The party ban became official in 2022.The company cracked down on parties and implemented a number of new safety measures in 2019 in response to a deadly shooting at an Airbnb booking that left five dead.Following the shooting, CEO Brian Chesky announced a ban on \"party houses\" in a post to the social media platform now known as X. At the time, Chesky said that the company was also cracking down on \"abusive host and guest conduct.\"Airbnb said accounts that break the no party policy will be suspended or banned from the platform. The company also said its offers features like a 24-hour safety line and noise sensor for hosts.WATCH: Airbnb CEO Brian Chesky on new product updates, integrating AI and state of AI tech racewatch now",

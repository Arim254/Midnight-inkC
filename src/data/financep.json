    "body": "Robotaxi operator Pony.ai has begun testing rides with human staff inside between a suburb of Beijing and a major high-speed train station.CNBC | Evelyn ChengChinese robotaxi company Pony.ai announced Friday it is working with Stellantis for testing self-driving taxis in Europe.The companies said they will start tests in the coming months in Luxembourg, where Pony.ai's European division is headquartered. Starting next year, the companies plan \"a gradual rollout across European cities.\"Pony.ai will provide the autonomous driving software, while Stellantis — which owns brands including Chrysler, Citroën and Jeep — will provide the electric vehicles, starting with the Peugeot e-Traveller.Deploying robotaxis for the mass market typically starts with local testing on public roads in order to establish a safety track record for obtaining regulatory approval.\"Pony.ai stands out for their technical expertise and collaborative approach,\"Stellantis' Chief Engineering and Technology Officer Ned Curic said that Pony.ai is known for its \"technical expertise and collaborative approach.\" He noted that the automaker has built car systems for autonomous driving integration and is \"partnering with the best players in the industry.\"Major U.S. and Chinese cities have been some of the first in the world to allow local companies to operate public-facing robotaxis.The companies have, in the last year, ramped up efforts to expand to the Middle East and Europe.Earlier this week, U.S. robotaxi operator Waymo announced plans to start tests in London before launching the self-driving taxi service there next year. Waymo is owned by Google parent Alphabet.Pony.ai and its Chinese rival WeRide are both listed in the U.S. The two companies this week received Chinese regulatory approval for their plans to offer shares in a dual listing in Hong Kong.—CNBC's Lora Kolodny contributed to this report.",

    "body": "Dado Ruvic | ReutersThe U.S. Chamber of Commerce on Thursday filed a lawsuit over the Trump administration imposing a $100,000 fee to the H-1B worker visas.Last month President Donald Trump announced plans that would see U.S. companies to pay $100,000 per year for H-1B visas -- which allows companies to temporarily hire foreign workers in skilled occupations in various fields, including technology and engineering -- in an attempt to rework the program.In a release regarding the lawsuit on Thursday, the Chamber called the new fee unlawful since it \"overrides provisions of the Immigration and Nationality Act that govern the H-1B program, including the requirement that fees be based on the costs incurred by the government in processing visas.\"\"The new $100,000 visa fee will make it cost-prohibitive for U.S. employers, especially start-ups and small and midsize businesses, to utilize the H-1B program, which was created by Congress expressly to ensure that American businesses of all sizes can access the global talent they need to grow their operations here in the U.S.,\" said Neil Bradley, executive vice president and chief policy officer at the U.S. Chamber in the release.A White House representative didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.The steep fee was expected to be a big blow to companies in the technology sector, particularly startups and venture capital-backed companies, which often rely on skilled workers from India and China.Big Tech companies, including those that donated heavily to the Trump campaign, have been beneficiaries of the program.It was already difficult for U.S. startups to secure H-1B visas due to limited annual quotas.H-1B visas -- created by Congress in 1990 -- are typically valid for three years and can be extended up to six years. The program is capped at 65,000 visas per year, with an additional carve out of 20,000 for individuals with advanced degrees. Prior to the change, fees had ranged from $2,000 to $5,000 per application, depending on the size of the company, CNBC previously reported.The administration has also proposed further changes to the H-1B program's lottery selection system.The changes have come in the months following Trump entering office and amid a push to limit immigration and see American companies hire more domestically.\"President Trump has embarked on an ambitious agenda of securing permanent pro-growth tax reforms, unleashing American energy, and unraveling the overregulation that has stifled growth. The Chamber and our members have actively backed these proposals to attract more investment in America. To support this growth, our economy will require more workers, not fewer,\" Bradley said in the Thursday release.",

David Ake | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesThe U.S. budget deficit edged lower for 2025 as record-setting tariff collections helped offset what also were unprecedented numbers for payments on the spiraling national debt, the Treasury Department announced Thursday.In a year marked by a bruising trade war and high financing costs, the federal government managed to escape with a $1.78 trillion shortfall, some $41 billion, or 2.2%, less than in fiscal 2024.While that's still on the high end historically, the red ink would have been still worse had it not been for a massive surge in customs duties and a September surplus of $198 billion that also set a record for the month.President Donald Trump's tariffs were a major contributor to tariff collections of $202 billion for the year, representing a 142% surge from 2024. September saw $30 billion in tariff payments, up 295% from the same period a year ago.Treasury officials estimated Thursday that the dip in the budget shortfall will bring the ratio of deficit to gross domestic product to 5.9%. The measure has not been below 6% since 2022 and generally runs around the 3% area except in times of economic stress.In an interview last week, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, noting Congressional Budget Office estimates that the deficit-to-GDP number would be below 6%, said \"we're on our way\" to reducing the debt and deficit burden.The impact from the deficit was felt in interest paid on the $38 trillion national debt.Interest on the debt totaled more than $1.2 trillion, also a record and nearly $100 billion higher than the 2024 outlay.Excluding interest that the Treasury earns on its investments, net interest payments totaled $970 billion, topping defense spending by $57 billion and behind only Social Security, Medicare and health care costs in the national budget.Trump slapped controversial tariffs on U.S. imports earlier this year despite protests that they would spike inflation and hurt consumers, resulting in lower demand and a hit to economic growth.While there have been signs of price increases in tariff-sensitive items, the moves have been mostly incremental. Federal Reserve officials say they likely will lower their benchmark interest rate further as they expect any price increases to be temporary. The current fed funds rate stands at 4.00% to 4.25%.The government's fiscal year ended in September, with the U.S. collecting $5.2 trillion in revenue over the prior 12 months while spending just over $7 trillion.",

    "body": "US President Donald Trump makes an announcement in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington, DC, on Oct. 16, 2025. Andrew Caballero-Reynolds | AFP | Getty ImagesPresident Donald Trump on Thursday announced two new efforts to expand the availability of in vitro fertilization, the first concrete step from his administration on the expensive and politically fraught procedure.Trump struck a deal with EMD Serono, a subsidiary of Germany's Merck KGaA, to slash the price of some of the company's fertility medicines in exchange for relief from planned tariffs on pharmaceuticals imported into the U.S., which Trump has not yet imposed.The Trump administration will also be issuing guidance encouraging employers to offer fertility benefits directly to their employees, which would work similarly to vision or dental coverage. It will allow employers to offer add-on coverage at a fixed cost for patients and employers. But it's unclear how much the effort will increase coverage, as it does not mandate that employers participate.At a press conference Thursday, Trump said the moves will lead to \"many more beautiful American children.\"\"We'll dramatically slash the cost of IVF and the treatment and many of the most common fertility drugs for countless millions of Americans,\" Trump said. \"Prices are going way down, way, way down.\"EMD Serono, the largest fertility drug manufacturer in the world, said it will sell its IVF therapies directly to patients and that people will be able to buy the drugs on Trump's direct-to-consumer purchasing site, TrumpRx.gov. That site will launch in January 2026.The medications include Gonal-f, a critical drug used in the shot protocol required for egg stimulation.The plan comes as Trump works to rein in prescription drug costs in the U.S., inking deals with Pfizer and AstraZeneca in recent weeks that aim to make it easier for Americans to access certain drugs.Millions of babies have been born through IVF, which involves combining eggs and sperm in a laboratory to create an embryo for couples having difficulty conceiving. The decades-old procedure is an issue that the president repeatedly vowed to address on the campaign trail, calling himself the \"father of IVF\" last fall.The procedure is often not fully covered by insurance — if at all — and it can cost around $20,000 or more per cycle. Only a quarter of companies with more than 200 employees currently cover IVF. Some studies have shown that an IVF cycle in the U.S. costs 271% more than the average in 25 other countries. Trump issued an executive order on IVF shortly after the president took office, promising to lower costs and make the procedure more accessible. But that order did not provide specifics apart from promising to put out a detailed report with recommendations on the issue by late May. That report has not been released. The procedure became a flashpoint in the nationwide clash over abortion and reproductive rights in early 2024 when Alabama's Supreme Court said that frozen embryos are children and those who destroy them can be held liable for wrongful death. In some cases, embryos may be discarded during IVF. Trump quickly distanced himself from that ruling last year, urging the Alabama Legislature to protect access to IVF. Americans generally support the procedure. An April 2024 poll from Pew Research Center found that seven in 10 U.S. adults say IVF access is a good thing, with modest differences across most demographic and partisan groups. ",

    "body": "Former National Security Adviser John Bolton speaks to reporters after speaking in a panel hosted by the National Council of Resistance of Iran – U.S. Representative Office (NCRI-US) at the Willard InterContinental Hotel on Aug. 17, 2022 in Washington, DC.Anna Moneymaker | Getty ImagesJohn Bolton, a former national security advisor to President Donald Trump and former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, was indicted Thursday by a federal grand jury in Maryland on charges of mishandling classified information.Bolton, 76, is the third high-profile Trump foe in recent weeks to be criminally charged after extensive criticism by the president.The 26-page indictment in U.S. District Court in Greenbelt charged the Republican with eight counts of transmission of national defense information and 10 counts of retention of national defense information.Bolton allegedly shared classified information with two relatives while he was Trump's national security advisor from April 2018 through September 2019, and kept such information at his home in Bethesda, Maryland, after leaving that post.The indictment also says that someone suspected of being affiliated with the Islamic Republic of Iran obtained classified information after hacking into Bolton's personal email account, which he used to share that information with his relatives.The charges came nearly two months after FBI agents raided Bolton's home and office in Washington, D.C., on Aug. 22 as part of the criminal investigation.Two senior federal law enforcement sources told NBC News that Bolton is expected to surrender to authorities on Friday and then appear in court later in the day.Bolton said he was innocent and that he was being targeted in a manner akin to the Soviet Union's secret police under Stalin because of his outspoken opposition to Trump.His claim echoed what former FBI Director James Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James said after they were separately indicted recently in Virginia following calls by Trump for them to be charged.\"These charges are not just about his focus on me or my diaries, but his intensive effort to intimidate his opponents, to ensure that he alone determines what is said about his conduct,\" Bolton said of Trump, who previously was prosecuted for retaining classified documents after his first term in the White House.Trump told reporters at the White House that he had not known that Bolton had been indicted.\"You're telling me for the first time, but I think he's ... a bad person,\" Trump said. \"He's a bad guy. It's too bad. But that's the way it goes right? That's the way it goes.\"Bolton faces a maximum possible sentence of 10 years in prison on each count if convicted. But federal sentencing guidelines would recommend a punishment that would be much less severe.FBI agents carry boxes as they exit the building that houses the Washington office of former National Security Adviser John Bolton, in Washington, D.C., U.S., August 22, 2025. Aaron Schwartz | ReutersThe indictment says that Bolton, from 2018 until August 2025, shared \"more than a thousand pages of his day-to-day activities as the National Security Advisor — including information relating to the national defense which was classified up to the TOP SECRET/SCI [sensitive compartmented information] level — with two unauthorized individuals\" who were relatives of his.Neither of those two people, who were identified by MSNBC as Bolton's wife and daughter, had security clearances, the indictment says.\"Bolton also unlawfully retained documents, writings, and notes relating to the national defense, including information classified up to the TOP SECRET/SCI level, in his home,\" the indictment said.Bolton is accused of sending, through non-governmental messaging applications like AOL and Gmail, \"diary-like entries\" that contained information classified as top secret to his two relatives.In July 2021, a representative of Bolton told the FBI that a cyber hacker believed to be associated with Iran hacked Bolton's personal email account, according to the indictment.On July 25, 2021, Bolton received an email related to the hack, which threatened to notify the FBI about it.Read more CNBC politics coverageIllinois Gov.

No one is above the law,\" Bondi said.Bolton's attorney, Abbe Lowell, in a statement, said, \"The underlying facts in this case were investigated and resolved years ago.\"\"These charges stem from portions of Amb. Bolton's personal diaries over his 45-year career – records that are unclassified, shared only with his immediate family, and known to the FBI as far back as 2021,\" Lowell said.\"Like many public officials throughout history, Amb. Bolton kept diaries – that is not a crime,\" Lowell said. \"We look forward to proving once again that Amb. Bolton did not unlawfully share or store any information.\"Bolton, in his own statement, \"For four decades, I have devoted my life to America's foreign policy and national security. I would never compromise those goals.\"He said that \"Trump's retribution against me began then, continued when he tried unsuccessfully to block the publication of my book, The Room Where It Happened, before the 2020 election, and became one of his rallying cries in his re-election campaign. Now, I have become the latest target in weaponizing the Justice Department to charge those he deems to be his enemies with charges that were declined before or distort the facts.\"Bolton also said that when his email was hacked, \"the FBI was made fully aware.''In four years of the prior administration, after these reviews, no charges were ever filed,\" Bolton said. \"Then came Trump 2 who embodies what Joseph Stalin's head of secret police once said, 'You show me the man, and I'll show you the crime.' \"\"Dissent and disagreement are foundational to America's constitutional system, and vitally important to our freedom,\" Bolton said. \"I look forward to the fight to defend my lawful conduct and to expose his abuse of power.\"",

    "body": "LONDON — EU heads of state will call for quicker action on the use of immobilized Russian assets at a meeting next week amid growing pressure from U.S. President Donald Trump, according to a document seen by CNBC.The European Commission, the executive arm of the EU, has been looking at how to use about 175 billion euros ($204 billion) in cash that has matured from frozen Russian assets held in Europe to further support Ukraine's coffers. The Trump administration has pushed its G-7 counterparts, which include Italy, France, and Germany, to seize billions in frozen Russian assets, according to the Financial Times. So far, European countries have used the profits generated by such assets to financially aid Kyiv, but some countries have been concerned about further measures due to potential financial and legal issues.\"The European Council is committed to finding ways to help address Ukraine's pressing needs for 2026-2027, including for its military and defense efforts. It therefore calls on the commission to present as soon as possible concrete proposals involving the possible use of the cash balances associated with the immobilized Russian assets,\" a draft document seen by CNBC stated. The document forms the basis for conversations among the 27 EU heads of state due to gather in Brussels Thursday.Belgium has been particularly tough on the subject, given that it hosts Euroclear – the financial institution that has the bulk of Russia's state assets which have been frozen in Europe since Moscow's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Belgium's leadership is concerned about the legal implications once the war is over and wants EU countries to commit to burden-sharing the responsibilities.\"In this context, the European Council stresses the importance of ensuring fair burden-sharing and coordination of efforts with G7 partners,\" the document seen by CNBC, and which is the basis for an agreement next week, states.watch nowValerie Urbain, CEO of Euroclear, told CNBC earlier this month that her job is also to draw leaders' attention to the implications of their decisions.\"We have been extremely vocal in making sure that we respect the rule of law,\" Urbain said, adding it is a question of ensuring investors do not lose confidence in investing in Europe.\"One thing which is extremely important is that we continue to be attractive for international investors, and especially when you see the gigantic financing needs of Europe in order to support, European sovereignty, in order to support transition to the greener economy, digital innovation, we really need to remain very attractive to external investors,\" she said.Next week's meeting comes at a time of increased pressure on European governments to support Ukraine after Trump dialled back on the U.S.' financial and military support to Kyiv. Data from the Kiel Institute, showed that between July and August, Ukraine received about 7.5 billion euros in financial and humanitarian support. Of the newly allocated funds, 86% came from EU institutions.The U.K., France and Germany came together last week calling for more action to support Ukraine. \"We are ready to progress towards using, in a coordinated way, the value of the immobilised Russian sovereign assets to support Ukraine's armed forces and thus bring Russia to the negotiation table,\" they said in a statement.",

Yuki Iwamura | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesUber plans to offer drivers and couriers in the U.S. ways to make money through the company's app when they're not ferrying around people or food.The ride-hailing company said on Thursday that it's starting a pilot with its AI Solutions Group that will allow drivers to complete small online jobs. The example Uber gave is \"uploading photos to help train AI models,\" which the company said is already being tested in India. Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi announced the news at the company's Only on Uber 2025 conference in Washington, D.C. Uber uses the event to reveal changes the company is making based on the best suggestions from drivers and couriers. In prepared remarks, Khosrowshahi said Uber held \"more than 60 Crew sessions with over 100 Uber team members, gathering hundreds of hours of feedback on everything from product design to policy changes,\" before making product and business changes.Meghan Casserly, an Uber spokesperson, said in an email that another example of a job drivers will be able to do is \"recording themselves speaking in certain languages or accents (following prompts).\" Casserly said that tasks will not be related to any of Uber's autonomous partnerships or the development of driverless vehicles.Pay for tasks will vary based on complexity and estimated time to completion. Drivers can see how much they will be paid before accepting a task.The work is reminiscent of the small online jobs offered by Amazon's Mechanical Turk, Upwork and other data labeling and freelance platforms. Uber said it doesn't disclose the client names or nature of the specific AI-related projects that gig workers may be working on when completing a task.Also on Thursday, Uber announced the official rollout of its women rider preference offering that pairs women drivers and riders. The service, which was introduced in July, will now be available for drivers in Baltimore, Minneapolis, Philadelphia, Seattle, Portland, Oregon, and Washington, D.C. \"In markets where it's already live around the world, women drivers have embraced the choice — using it on more than 100 million trips,\" Khosrowshahi said. All Uber drivers can now set a rider rating preference to avoid being paired with a low-rated passenger, the company said on Thursday. Drivers can adjust their minimum rider rating level for different times of day or night. Uber is also launching what it's calling a delayed ride guarantee for drivers, ensuring that rides that take more than five minutes longer than estimated result in a higher payout. \"In some instances costs may be passed onto the rider,\" Casserly said. It depends if a trip was delayed for something like heavy traffic or if more stops were added by the passenger. WATCH: Uber CEO on Q2 resultswatch now",

    "body": "A sign is posted in front of a Genentech office on June 12, 2025 in South San Francisco, California. Justin Sullivan | Getty ImagesRoche's Genentech on Thursday said it will sell its flu pill, Xofluza, directly to certain patients at a discount in a bid to expand access, becoming the latest company to wade into the direct-to-consumer space. It follows similar moves by other drugmakers to simplify how Americans get their medicines, and comes as companies face pressure from the Trump administration to lower U.S. drug prices. Genentech's new program also launches ahead of the flu season, which typically peaks in the winter months. The 2024 to 2025 flu season was the most severe in more than a decade, according to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data. Genentech's new program aims to reach uninsured patients, those with limited coverage or people whose plans don't cover the pill, according to a release. The company will provide access to Xofluza through three pharmacies with a $50 cash pay option, which is 70% lower than the pill's current list price before insurance. That includes Mark Cuban's direct-to-consumer pharmacy Cost Plus Drug Company, Amazon Pharmacy and Fuze Health's Alto Pharmacy. Genentech said same-day home delivery is available in certain markets through the latter two pharmacies. Home mail delivery is also available nationwide through all three pharmacies for people who want to use Xofluza as a prevention treatment. The pill is a single-dose antiviral treatment for people ages 5 and above, typically taken within 48 hours of the onset of flu symptoms. Xofluza costs over $150 for one treatment, according to some drug price websites. On top of the new effort, Genentech also offers a coupon that allows eligible patients to pay as little as $35 for their Xofluza prescription, with up to $70 off at most pharmacies.Trump in July sent letters to 17 drugmakers urging them to take specific steps to curb costs for patients, including by launching direct-to-consumer sales models for their medicines. Companies had to respond by Sept. 29. Since then, Pfizer and AstraZeneca have inked deals with Trump to lower drug prices. It was part of his effort to revive a controversial plan called the \"most favored nation\" policy, which aims to tie the prices of some drugs in the U.S. to the significantly lower ones abroad.",

Discovery, announced Thursday its \"All Access\" subscription will launch in the U.S. on October 28 and cost $6.99 per month or $69.99 annually.The new plan is pitched as a centralized hub for CNN's journalism and includes access to live and on-demand U.S. and international video programming, CNN.com articles and subscriber-only content across all platforms. To attract early adopters, the company is offering a limited-time annual subscription for $41.99 for those who sign up by January 5.\"No one covers the world like CNN,\" said Alex MacCallum, executive vice president of digital products and services at CNN Worldwide, in a release. \"This is an essential step in CNN's evolution, providing a comprehensive experience that meets how audiences consume news today.\"The All Access plan builds on CNN's existing digital subscription, now rebranded as the Basic tier. Originally launched in 2024, the Basic plan includes unlimited access to CNN articles and select subscriber features, but excludes video content.The news company has toyed with the idea of different subscription options for years.CNN+, a subscription service that offered a mix of live news, on-demand programs and unique original series, was canned just a month after its launch in March 2022. The closure was partly the result of the merger between Warner Bros. and Discover in April 2022 and amid disappointing subscription numbers and internal challenges at CNN. Warner Bros. Discovery is undergoing a shakeup of its own. The media giant announced in June that it plans to split into two public companies by 2026. The streaming and studios company will include its movie properties and HBO Max, and a global networks company will include CNN among other businesses.At the same time, Paramount Skydance has been eyeing a takeover of WBD prior to a possible spin.",

Photographer: Hollie Adams/Bloomberg via Getty ImagesBloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesNestle said Thursday it will cut 16,000 jobs as the firm's new CEO, Philipp Navratil, looks to accelerate a turnaround at the consumer goods giant.In a bid to improve operational efficiency, the firm said it will cut 12,000 white-collar jobs and a further 4,000 roles will be reduced over the next two years.\"We are transforming how we work,\" Navratil wrote in a LinkedIn post summarizing the company's earnings report. \"We are evolving and will simplify our organization and automate our processes.\"It's unclear how Nestle plans to incorporate more automation into its corporate offices, but company spokesperson Chiara Valsangiacomo told CNBC that the initiative is \"much broader\" than replacing roles with artificial intelligence. Other companies, primarily in the tech sector, have slashed jobs as they turn to AI to replace human labor. So far this year, more than 17,000 job losses have been specifically tied to AI, according to a recent report from Challenger, Gray & Christmas.Shares of Nestle closed 9.3% higher on Thursday. The stock price jump boosted Europe's food and beverage sector, which was up more than 4.2% at the end of the session.Under its former CEO, Laurent Freixe, Nestle had already announced a cost-savings program worth 2.5 billion Swiss francs ($3.14 billion). This has now been accelerated to 3 billion francs by the end of 2027. The company posted a better-than-expected organic growth rate of 4.3% in the third quarter as it battles an uncertain consumer outlook amid U.S. tariffs and an increase in raw material prices, such as cocoa and coffee beans. Notably, real internal growth, or RIG, returned to positive territory in the third quarter — up 1.5% — as the maker of Nespresso and KitKat saw growth investments pay off, also helped by easier comparisons. watch nowA miss on RIG in the second quarter had led to a sharp underperformance of Nestle shares. Ahead of the results, analysts at HSBC had already expected RIG to return to positive territory \"owing to easier comparatives, incrementally greater benefits from Nestle's own actions plus reduced elasticity effects from price increases.\"However, the company's business in Greater China continued to underperform, with the region negatively impacting organic growth by 80 basis points and RIG by 40 basis points. Nestle added that \"new management was now in place and it was executing its plan to transform the business.\" The firm's strategy of focusing on winners and turning around its losers helped driver better-than-expected third-quarter sales, said Jon Cox, head of European consumer equities, at Kepler Cheuvreux.\"Overall, it is extremely positive and certainly looks operationally as if the company has turned the corner with the better performance while the management upheaval over the summer fades into the background,\" Cox said, adding he expects the stock to react very positively.Turbulent yearThe Vevey, Switzerland-based consumer goods giant has come under pressure from investors as its operating and share performance have trailed peers.Its shares are off more than 40% from their December 2021 peak, and have fallen 9% over the past 12 months. Stock Chart IconStock chart iconNestle's sharesNestle has endured a turbulent year, as it saw its CEO Freixe ousted over an undisclosed romantic relationship on Sept. 1. His successor, Navratil is the former CEO of the company's Nespresso business. He has pledged to \"fully embrace the company's strategic direction, as well as the action plan in place to drive Nestle's performance,\" and vowed to \"accelerate execution and to drive the value creation plan with intensity.\" Only two weeks later, Nestle saw itself forced to accelerate Chairman Paul Bulcke's departure, owing to pressure from institutional shareholders over his handling of Freixe's allegations. Bulcke, also a former CEO of Nestle, stepped down from his role earlier than planned, handing over the reins to Vice Chairman and Chairman-elect Pablo Isla, a former Inditex CEO, who was set to take over after Nestle's AGM in April 2026. Analysts say the new leadership duo will need to earn back trust from investors. \"Many long term investors … would have to hear more from someone who is relatively unknown to the market before becoming more positive,\" Deutsche Bank analysts wrote in a September note.While the initial focus will be on recovery in volume growth and its Chinese business, longer-term investors will be keen to receive updates on the partial sale of Nestle's struggling water unit as well as its underperforming vitamins business, along with plans for its 20% stake in L'Oreal. \"Now we must do more and move faster to accelerate our growth momentum,\" Navratil said Thursday in a statement on the company's earnings. \"As Nestle moves forward, we will be rigorous in our approach to resource allocation, prioritising the opportunities and businesses with the highest potential return.\"— CNBC's Amelia Lucas contributed reporting for this story.Correction: Jon Cox is head of European consumer equities at Kepler Cheuvreux.

Conway is a longtime Democratic donor who was a member of VCs for Kamala, and donated around $500,000 to at least two funds tied to Kamala Harris' unsuccessful 2024 election campaign.The New York Times was first to report on Conway's departure from the Salesforce Foundation. A Salesforce spokesperson confirmed his exit in an e-mailed statement.\"We have deep gratitude for Ron Conway and his incredible contributions to the Salesforce Foundation Board for over a decade,\" the spokesperson said, noting that the group has donated, \"$250 million to public schools and education nonprofits to advance opportunity and access for young people, including $30 million announced this week.\"The Trump administration recently deployed the National Guard to Portland, Oregon and Chicago, sparking protests and lawsuits and resulting in citizens and immigrants being detained without legal representation.In a story published late last week in the New York Times, Benioff indicated that he would welcome troops to San Francisco, home to Salesforce. The company's annual Dreamforce conference began in downtown San Francisco on Tuesday.\"We don't have enough cops, so if they can be cops, I'm all for it,\" Benioff told the Times.Benioff later appeared to walk back his comments, writing on X that safety is \"first and foremost, the responsibility of our city and state leaders.\" However, by that point Tesla CEO Elon Musk and other right-wing figures had seized on his original comments, amplifying them to their audiences.Musk, who has drawn criticism for his personal drug use, characterized downtown San Francisco as a \"drug zombie apocalypse.\" And on Wednesday, Trump called San Francisco \"a mess,\" and suggested possibly sending in the National Guard.

    "body": "Russian President Vladimir Putin watches with binoculars the Tsentr-2019 military exercise at the Donguz range near Orenburg city on September 20, 2019.Alexey Nikolsky | Afp | Getty ImagesRussia was an indirect beneficiary of the war in Gaza in that it distracted the U.S. and other Western countries from its ongoing war in Ukraine.But now that there's a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas and a fledgling peace process has begun, U.S. President Donald Trump is turning his sights on ending the war in Ukraine.The president said Thursday that he and other \"high-level advisors\" will meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Budapest, Hungary, to discuss how to end the war. It comes following a call with the two leaders in which Trump said Putin had congratulated him on the \"great accomplishment of peace in the Middle East.\"\"President Putin and I will then meet in an agreed upon location, Budapest, Hungary, to see if we can bring this \"inglorious\" War, between Russia and Ukraine, to an end. ... I believe great progress was made with today's telephone conversation,\" Trump said in a post on Truth Social.The meeting will be the second time the leaders have come face-to-face during Trump's second term, and could happen within the next two weeks, according to the U.S. leader.Tomahawk missilesOne way the White House is turning the screws on Moscow is by mooting the possibility of supplying Ukraine with long-range Tomahawk missiles. Trump is due to meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the White House on Friday, with the leaders expected to discuss the matter.Earlier in the week, Trump told reporters that he might use the Tomahawk missiles as leverage with Russia, saying he could tell Putin: \"Look: if this war is not going to get settled, I'm going to send them Tomahawks.\"In another sign that the administration could be ready to deepen its military support for Kyiv, U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth promised Wednesday that \"firepower\" was coming for Ukraine, although he did not mention Tomahawks by name.Read moreRenewed push for peaceTrump made no secret this week of the fact that he and envoys were planning to immediately renew efforts to bring the war in Ukraine to an end as it approaches its fourth anniversary.Addressing Israeli lawmakers on Monday as he celebrated a ceasefire deal between Hamas and Israel, Trump told the Knesset, Israel's parliament, \"We have to get Russia done.\"\"Steve, let's focus on Russia first, alright? We'll get it [done],\" Trump said, addressing the U.S.' Special Envoy Steve Witkoff.watch nowHaving boasted ahead of his second term in office that he could get the Ukraine war to end in just \"one day,\" he conceded that it had proved trickier than he anticipated, noting: \"I thought it would be easily settled. I thought it was a hell of a lot easier than doing what we just did [in Gaza].\"Victoria Coates, vice president at the Heritage Foundation's Davis Institute, told CNBC this week that the ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas would likely have an impact on the Russia-Ukraine war.\"The momentum behind resolving the Gaza conflict can help get to a resolution of the Ukraine war,\" Coates, a deputy national security advisor in Trump's first administration, told CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" on Tuesday.\"All these other countries that the president was meeting with [this week], and getting them behind conflict resolution, [can lead to] maybe putting some pressure on Putin to come to the table. So this can have a positive effect on Ukraine,\" she said.watch nowOf course, the big question now is whether Russia is ready to play ball with Trump and his team.Will Moscow play ball?The Kremlin appears to be keen to show willingness in working toward ending the conflict, although critics (not least Ukraine) say that Russia is skilful at employing delay tactics so it can prolong the war to make territorial gains.On Tuesday, the Kremlin reiterated Russia's position, vehemently disputed by Kyiv and its Western allies, that it was Ukrainian intransigence that was preventing an end to the war which Russia launched in February 2022.\"Certainly, we welcome such intentions, we welcome the confirmation of the political will to assist the search for peaceful solutions in every possible way,\" Russian presidential press secretary Dmitry Peskov said on Tuesday, in comments reported by Interfax.Russian President Vladimir Putin speaks with Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov during a summit of leaders of nations, which are members of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), in Moscow, Russia October 8, 2024. Sergei Ilnitsky | Via ReutersRussia \"remains open to and ready for a peace dialogue,\" Peskov said, adding that \"we hope that the influence of the United States and the diplomatic prowess of President Trump's envoys will certainly help prompt the Ukrainian side toward a greater readiness for a peace process.\"CNBC has contacted the Kremlin for further comment on its expectations for renewed talks with the U.S., and is awaiting a response.Calling Putin's bluffRussia's ability to wage war in Ukraine with relative impunity could be nearing an end, with Trump showing increasing frustration with Putin in a clear change from the rapport on show at their Alaska summit in August.U.S. President Donald Trump shakes hands with Russian President Vladimir Putin before a joint news conference following their meeting at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson in Anchorage, Alaska, U.S., August 15, 2025. Gavriil Grigorov | Via ReutersAside from touting the prospect of giving Ukraine Tomahawks — which the Kremlin admitted last Sunday was of \"extreme concern\" — Trump has been putting pressure on Russia's allies, slapping tariffs on India for buying Russian oil.Trump, who recently disparaged Russia as a \"paper tiger,\" has also repeatedly threatened to put further sanctions on Russia itself but has so far held off, disappointing Kyiv and other Western partners.Tomahawk talks could be a turning point for Russia, according to Peter Dickinson, editor of the Atlantic Council think tank's Ukraine Alert publication. Dickinson on Tuesday said that this will be the case if Trump is willing to call Putin's bluff by pledging to supply Tomahawks, regardless of whether he does end up doing so.\"Trump must now decide whether he will call Putin's bluff and arm Ukraine with Tomahawk missiles. There are mounting indications that he may be inclined to do so,\" Dickinson said. \"Trump now has an opportunity to convince his Russian counterpart that he is not as easily intimidated as other Western leaders and is more than ready to increase the pressure on Moscow until Putin agrees to pursue peace,\" he said in an online analysis.\"Many of Trump's detractors will no doubt scoff at the idea of the U.S. president adopting such a uncompromising stance toward Putin, but few objective observers would question that this approach is the only way to end the war,\" he said.",

    "body": "President Donald Trump listens during a Cabinet meeting at the White House on April 30, 2025 in Washington, DC. Andrew Harnik | Getty ImagesViresh Varma can't sleep. The CEO of AV Universal Corp., a small footwear company that sells through retailers like Macy's, Nordstrom and DSW, said he needed to take out a $250,000 loan to pay his tariff bill on a container of shoes he imported from India for the holiday shopping season. Varma didn't have the cash on hand to pay the duties, which he said used to be around $7,500 for a similar-sized container before President Donald Trump's new tariffs. But without the financing, he wouldn't have anything to sell during the holidays.So the 64-year-old said he was faced with a choice: take on the line of credit— which came with onerous terms like weekly payments and a 32% interest rate — and raise prices to pay it back, or close the business he's spent the last nine years building. He decided to take out the loan.\"Everybody believes that I'm a fighter, so I'm fighting it,\" Varma told CNBC in an interview. \"We've reduced some salaries. We had planned to hire some people we're not going to hire anymore … If things don't look good, especially after increasing the prices, and we don't get the sales, then obviously we may lay off some people, as well.\" AV Universal Corp. is just one of the many small businesses that are buckling under Trump's global trade war, struggling to pay the sudden increase in duties and forecast what's ahead as policy evolves. Businesses of all sizes have raised prices and negotiated with vendors to weather the tariff storm and many larger retailers have so far proven resilient, with minimal impact to their profitability and future growth outlooks. Better-than-expected quarterly reports have led investors to largely shrug off the tariff threat, as the S&P 500 hovers near record highs.But the higher costs have hit smaller companies harder because they have fewer levers to pull than their larger competitors. Their margins are slimmer, their supply chains less diverse and their negotiating power with vendors dampened by the smaller sizes of their orders.Small businesses owners interviewed by CNBC said they largely expect to be able to manage higher costs from tariffs by raising prices, but only if it doesn't cause shoppers to buy less — which most are already starting to see.Often called the backbone of the U.S. economy, small businesses routinely represent more than 40% of the nation's GDP and employ nearly half of the American workforce, according to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. Trump says his tariffs allow the U.S. to reduce its trade deficits with other nations and encourage domestic manufacturing, but some of the small business owners who spoke to CNBC said that's happening partially at their expense.The struggles they're facing could be a warning sign for the rest of the economy and bigger businesses in 2026, said Kent Smetters, a professor of business economics and public policy at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School.\"The small businesses … they're kind of like the canary in the coal mine here,\" said Smetters, the faculty director of the Penn Wharton Budget Model. \"They're going to get hit first, and then I think you're going to see more of an impact with some delay on larger businesses.\" Larger retailers have been able to manage higher tariff costs in part because they had the foresight and ability to order extra inventory before the new duties went into effect, said Smetters. At a certain point, that stock will run out and push costs higher, and those companies only have so many low-tariff countries where they can produce goods.The fate of many of Trump's tariffs is unclear after a federal court ruled them illegal, prompting an appeal from the White House that the Supreme Court is now reviewing. The nation's highest court, which includes three Trump appointees and has a 6-3 conservative majority, agreed to hear the appeal on a faster-than-normal timeline with arguments scheduled for the first week of November. It's unclear how fast the justices will issue a ruling, and the tariffs remain in effect during the appeal.CNBC spoke with around a dozen business owners to better understand how tariffs are affecting them. Here's how much the duties are costing some of those companies — and what the businesses are doing to offset them.AV Universal Corp.Total tariffs paid in 2024: $45,000Total tariffs expected in 2025: $353,125Employees: 10Supply chain: India 80%, Vietnam 15%, Europe 5% Varma, AV's CEO, spent much of his career in corporate America before deciding to get into the footwear business about a decade ago. He built three brands from scratch that are now sold online by Amazon, Macy's, DSW, Nordstrom and other retailers. Varma was in the process of sending orders for the 2025 holiday season — which typically accounts for about 40% of AV's annual revenue — when Trump announced tariffs on dozens of trading partners on April 2. Thinking the president was bluffing, Varma placed an order for 20,000 pairs of shoes from his manufacturer in India, but ultimately only shipped half because he couldn't line up the financing necessary to pay the expected tariff bill on the entire order. Varma expects holiday sales to drop about 30% because he'll have less inventory to sell, but that decline could get worse if consumers balk at the higher prices he implemented. Since he increased prices earlier this year, sales fell about 30% in August and September. Varma has searched across the globe to escape the Trump administration's 50% tariff on Indian goods and is now considering moving his manufacturing to China, as long as Trump walks back his latest threat to raise tariffs on Chinese imports to 100%.Talus ProductsTotal tariffs paid in 2024: ~$223,000*Total tariffs expected in 2025: ~$499,000*Employees: 9Supply chain: primarily China  *The figures are adjusted for order volumeTalus Products co-founder and CEO David McClees (middle left) pictured with his team during the holidays. HandoutDavid McClees, the co-founder and CEO of Talus Products, opened his business 38 years ago with a single product: an inflatable travel pillow. The company has since expanded into a range of items, including car organizers and other travel accessories, that it distributes through retailers like The Container Store, Amazon and airport gift shops. McClees said he's not worried about having to shut down operations, but said he expects tariffs to put a \"severe crimp\" in his annual profitability. The company raised prices on certain products to offset tariffs, but is waiting until January to hike again, partially over concerns it could dampen consumer demand during the holiday shopping season. Sales on Amazon, which account for more than half of Talus's revenue, have already been \"soft\" in recent weeks, he said. \"We're nervous,\" said McClees. \"We don't typically offer huge discounts on Prime Day, but we do see a bump from their increased traffic, and that was smaller than what we would normally see. It seems like buyers are being very cautious.\" McClees attempted to move some of Talus's production to Mexico and Vietnam, but said he ultimately decided it was too expensive.Village LightingTotal tariffs paid in 2024: less than $50,000Total tariffs expected in 2025: at least $1 million Employees: between 11 and 17, depending on seasonSupply chain: 50% spread across Vietnam, Cambodia, Indonesia, Myanmar and Thailand, the other 50% in China  Village Lighting CEO Jared Hendricks (center, pictured in white) with his wife, children and son-in-law. HandoutJared Hendricks, the founder and CEO of Village Lighting, started his business 20 years ago making Christmas lighting and decorations before expanding into holiday storage, selling directly to consumers via his website and through big box stores like Walmart and Target. Since his business is centered around the holidays, his buying and cash flow needs are unique compared to others in the retail industry. Every year, just before Christmas, he said he uses a $2 million line of credit he took out against his home to buy the inventory he needs for the following year's holiday and then uses that eventual revenue to pay back the debt. This year, he had to use that line of credit to pay his tariff bill. \"Hopefully I can turn around and mark things up enough for people to buy them from me so I can pay back my tariff debt,\" said Hendricks. \"It's to the point now where it could kill us, it could take us down, and I could lose everything. I can't afford to not bring stuff in because I'll have nothing to sell. So that's a game over scenario.\" Because of Village Lighting's unique buying schedule, the company had to take a loss on about 40% of his annual sales because the orders and pricing were already contractually agreed upon when many of the new duties went into effect. He said he hopes to make it up by raising prices on his website and wholesale customers. Sales so far this season have been down between 8% and 10% and he owes millions of dollars to his suppliers, who have agreed to accept late payments. Hendricks said the situation has created massive stress for him and his wife, adding that the challenges the Covid-19 pandemic posed to his business feel like \"a piece of cake\" compared to now. \"I call them my demons. They're my two or three o'clock in the morning demons, where they just wake me up in a panic, like, 'how am I going to pay for this? Or how am I going to make this work? What have I done? Should I have quit last April and just cashed in?'\" said Hendricks. \"Being a small business owner isn't worth it when your country turns on you.\" Picnic TimeTotal tariffs paid in 2024: $950,000Total tariffs expected in 2025: $2.25 millionEmployees: 75Supply chain: 85%-90% in China, the remainder in India Picnic Time CEO Paul Cosaro, shown in a gray shirt, with his family outside of the company's headquarters. HandoutPaul Cosaro's family business, Picnic Time, was started 43 years ago by his father, an Italian immigrant on a mission to sell high-quality picnic baskets. The company now sells a wide range of products, from coolers to beach chairs, to major retailers like Kohl's, Target and Macy's. Since Trump's new tariffs went into effect, Picnic Time had to freeze hiring and capital expenditures, limiting its ability to produce and release new products, Cosaro said. \"It absolutely has stifled innovation,\" he said. \"You don't want to take risks anymore... there's no room for error.\" Cosaro said he attempted to move his supply chain to other countries during Trump's first term, hiring additional staff and conducting sourcing missions in India and Mexico. But years later, he was only able to move about 10% of production. He said he raised his prices earlier this year to account for the new tariffs and the third quarter has so far been \"very, very, very soft.\" Sales are down about 20% and key retailers have pulled back on orders. The holiday season is always important to Picnic Time, as it accounts for about 35% of annual revenue, but this year it feels like the company is putting \"all of our eggs in one basket,\" said Cosaro. \"For us, it's critically important,\" he said. \"We're literally going to be waiting until the last day of the year to find out if this is going to be a profitable year or not.\" For now, Cosaro said he will keep his supply chain primarily in China. He's considered moving some of it to the U.S., but said he doesn't have the budget available to take the risk. CitibinTotal tariffs paid in 2024: $67,883Total tariffs expected in 2025: $380,000Employees: 8Supply chain: 90% Vietnam, 5% China, 5% U.S. Frank Picarazzi, the chief operating officer of Citibin (left)HandoutWhen Liz Picarazzi first started Citibin, which makes rat-proof trash enclosures for cities, parks and homes, the company manufactured in the U.S. After a few years, she said she found U.S. producers couldn't meet her expectations on price, quality or lead time. She moved production to China and for several years, the business enjoyed manageable tariffs and reliable partners. However, in the leadup to the 2024 election, she and her husband Frank Picarazzi, Citibin's COO, started looking for other options over concerns that either candidate would raise tariff rates. \"I told Frank two days after the election, 'we're going to Vietnam, like, as soon as we can,'\" Liz Picarazzi said. The couple spent the next few months moving most of their production to Vietnam, only to learn of Trump's decision to raise tariffs on all aluminum and steel imports to 50%. That raised costs for just about every product Citibin sells. Though her supply chain is now more diversified, Liz Picarazzi said that moving to Vietnam was \"somewhat pointless\" as a result. Meanwhile, she said higher costs are affecting talent retention, research and development and revenue. The company has added a 15% tariff surcharge to products to offset the cost of tariffs. Frank Picarazzi said it has contributed to a 25% decline in sales to homeowners, which the company expects will account for about 50% of overall revenue this year. Reekon ToolsTotal tariffs paid in 2024: $65,000Total tariffs expected in 2025: more than $400,000Employees: 20Supply chain: Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam and China Christian Reed, founder and CEO of Reekon Tools, on a job site holding the T1R Hybrid Laser Tape MeasureHandoutResearch and development is critical for Christian Reed's tool startup Reekon. He said the company had to cut back R&D spending by 20% because of tariffs. \"This certainly put a thorn in the side of our hiring plan for the rest of the year around engineers for R&D activities,\" said Reed. \"That's something that will continue to have to either be paused or completely canceled if nothing changes.\" The hundreds of thousands of dollars Reed planned to use to hire between three and five designers and engineers is now going to tariffs instead, he said. The company, which makes innovative products like digital tape measures for tradespeople, needs to ensure every tool it makes is effective and able to withstand tough conditions on work sites. \"There's a unique combination of making a product that you can feed up, throw on the concrete, you know, slam around and not break, and at the same time add this digital aspect,\" said Reed. \"So that puts a very high burden on the testing, the research we have to do … it's a very costly product as most of the products we're making are new to [the] world.\" Reed said he's avoided raising prices on most items, choosing to take the hit to profit margins, but recently increased the price of a new tool – a smaller version of its digital tape measure. Initially, Reekon wanted to price it at $99 and while the margins would've been slim, the company expected to be able to make it up in volume, Reed said. However, after tariff rates rose, the company priced it at $119 when it launched in September to help it offset losses in other parts of the business. While the product has been well received, sales so far have fallen short of the company's projections. ",

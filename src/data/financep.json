    "body": "Mike Cavanagh, President of Comcast Corporation attends the Allen & Company Sun Valley Conference on July 10, 2024 in Sun Valley, Idaho. TKevork Djansezian | Getty ImagesComcast's top brass on Monday pulled the curtain back on the company's unsuccessful bid for Warner Bros. Discovery, detailing an offer far different from its rival bidders. Mike Cavanagh, Comcast president and soon-to-be co-CEO, walked through the specifics of the proposal —and the company's thinking — during the UBS Global Media and Communications Conference on Monday, just days after Comcast was knocked out of the bidding war for Warner Bros. Discovery assets. \"When we looked at the circumstances of how it all came to be ... we didn't expect that we had a high likelihood of prevailing with a deal that made sense to us. We debated whether to bother or not. Do we want the disruption? Do we want the distraction?\" said Cavanagh. \"But it's our job, so we thought better to take a look and do the work and see where it leads. You never know. And so that's what we did.\" Comcast, like Netflix, bid solely on the Warner Bros. film studio and HBO Max streaming business. Paramount Skydance's offer was for the entirety of the business, including the cable TV portfolio comprised of networks like CNN and TNT. \"We are not interested in stressing the Comcast balance sheet,\" Cavanagh said Monday. \"As a result, that meant our proposal was light, relative to other proposals from what I gather, on cash.\" Last week Netflix was named the winning bidder. On Monday Paramount launched a hostile offer. Comcast offered \"a significant chunk of equity in a combined entertainment company,\" which would have put NBCUniversal — including its Universal theme parks and film studio as well as its broadcast network and streaming platform Peacock — together with Warner Bros.' studio and HBO Max, Cavanagh said. The resulting combination would have been a publicly traded, controlled subsidiary of Comcast. That vehicle would provide shareholders with returns, but would not constitute a full spinout, which would have involved a complete separation of the companies. Comcast's NBCUniversal is in the midst of a spinout of its portfolio of cable TV networks, which includes CNBC. In contrast, Netflix's proposed transaction is comprised of cash and stock, valued at $27.75 per WBD share. The equity value of the transaction is $72 billion, with a total enterprise value of about $82.7 billion.Paramount went straight to WBD shareholders on Monday with an all-cash, $30 per share tender offer, which equates to an enterprise value of $108.4 billion. \"We respect and understand the decision of the Warner Brothers board to obviously prefer the certainty of high levels of cash or collared stock,\" said Cavanagh.Comcast leadership has long said the company's bar for doing mergers and acquisitions is high. \"Good news is that we like what we are doing ... and we roll on with a lot of focus, but I think we're better for having taken a look,\" Cavanagh said. Peacock aspirations Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade, 2023: Birds Of A Feather Stream Together - Peacock FloatNBC | NBCUniversal | Getty ImagesComcast's NBCUniversal has been shape-shifting in recent years — from the spinout of its cable TV networks, to a heavy focus on bulking up on sports rights like the NBA, to building out its theme parks presence. The company has also been building out Peacock. NBCUniversal launched its streaming play in 2020 and it has slowly built up since then. As of Sept. 30 Peacock had 41 million subscribers, paling in comparison to HBO Max's 128 million customers as of Sept. 30 and Netflix's more than 300 million customers as of late 2024.Cavanagh said Monday that had Comcast's offer for Warner Bros. Discovery been successful, \"it would have been an interesting play.\"\"It probably would have changed our streaming aspirations to be global streaming aspirations by necessity,\" he added.Sports have been key to the playbook in fueling Peacock's subscriber growth. NBCUniversal has nabbed exclusive NFL games to Peacock in addition to simulcasting its \"Sunday Night Football\" package from NBC's broadcast network. It paid heavily to bring back the NBA to NBC, with exclusive games for Peacock, too. The Olympics have also be integral in its growth. Live events such as the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade have helped boost viewership across TV and streaming, too. Peacock has also been increasing its subscription price, similar to its peers. In July Peacock raised prices again, just months ahead of the beginning of the NBA season. Unlike most of its competitors, Peacock has yet to report a profit, however. For the quarter ended Sept. 30, Peacock reported losses of $217 million, an improvement from $436 million in losses during the same period last year. Cavanagh noted Monday that Peacock improved in the trailing 12 months by $900 million in earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. Peacock's losses are expected to \"meaningfully improve\" next year compared with 2025, with \"a trajectory to a positive future.\" Disclosure: CNBC parent NBCUniversal owns NBC Sports and NBC Olympics. NBC Olympics is the U.S. broadcast rights holder to all Summer and Winter Games through 2036. Versant would become the new parent company of CNBC upon Comcast's planned spinoff of Versant.",

    "body": "Google was on Tuesday hit with an EU antitrust investigation over its use of online content for AI purposes, marking the latest in a series of crackdowns from the bloc on regulating U.S. big tech companies. The European Commission said it was investigating whether Google had breached EU competition rules by using the content of web publishers, as well as content uploaded on the online video-sharing platform YouTube, for AI purposes.The probe will examine whether Google is distorting competition by imposing unfair terms and conditions on publishers and content creators, or by granting itself privileged access to that content and placing developers of rival AI models at a disadvantage, the Commission said. \"AI is bringing remarkable innovation and many benefits for people and businesses across Europe, but this progress cannot come at the expense of the principles at the heart of our societies,\" said the bloc's commissioner for competition Teresa Ribera. \"This is why we are investigating whether Google may have imposed unfair terms and conditions on publishers and content creators, while placing rival AI models developers at a disadvantage, in breach of EU competition rules.\"The Commission said it would investigate to what extent the generation of AI Overviews and AI Mode by Google is based on web publishers' content without appropriate compensation and without the possibility for publishers to refuse without losing access to Google Search.\"This complaint risks stifling innovation in a market that is more competitive than ever,\" a Google spokesperson told CNBC. \"Europeans deserve to benefit from the latest technologies and we will continue to work closely with the news and creative industries as they transition to the AI era.\"In September, the EU fined Google nearly 3 billion euros ($3.4 billion) for breaching antitrust rules by distorting competition in the advertising technology industry.At the time, Google's global head of regulatory affairs, Lee-Anne Mulholland said the EU decision was \"wrong\" and the firm would appeal. \"There's nothing anticompetitive in providing services for ad buyers and sellers, and there are more alternatives to our services than ever before,\" she said.EU vs. U.S. big techThe move follows a slew of actions the bloc has taken against U.S big tech companies in recent days. The Commission hit Elon Musk's social media app X with a 120-million-euro ($140 million) fine on Friday for breaching transparency obligations around its advertising repository and \"the deceptive design of its 'blue checkmark.'\" Musk called for the European Union to be abolished in response, with key Republican officials also criticizing the decision.Last week the EU also announced it had opened an antitrust investigation into Meta over its new policy on allowing AI providers' access to WhatsApp, which it said may breach the bloc's competition rules.",

    "body": "watch nowLate fall tends to be the time when the most homes come off the market, as so-far unsuccessful sellers would rather not sit through the slowest winter months. In October, however, delistings, which are reported with a one-month lag, were up 45.5% year to date and rose nearly 38% from October 2024, according to a new report from Realtor.com. The report calls it an \"unusually high rate,\" as this is now the highest delisting year since Realtor.com began tracking in 2022. Delistings started to rise in June and have remained elevated for five straight months. About 6% of active listings are coming off the market each month, which is typically only seen in the dead of winter. In addition, more potential buyers are heading to what Realtor.com calls \"refuge markets.\" These are areas where home prices are much more affordable and didn't see the run-up in prices during the first years of the pandemic. \"Rising delistings and the growth of refuge markets capture the push and pull defining today's housing market,\" said Danielle Hale, chief economist at Realtor.com, in a release. \"These dynamics reflect how higher rates and years of rapid price growth have rewritten the rules of engagement for both buyers and sellers.\"  Hale does forecast a gradual improvement next year, with potentially lower mortgage rates and more consistent supply creating an increasingly balanced market between buyer and seller.Get Property Play directly to your inboxCNBC's Property Play with Diana Olick covers new and evolving opportunities for the real estate investor, delivered weekly to your inbox.Subscribe here to get access today.Some of the cities that saw the most price growth over the past five years are now seeing the largest share of frustrated sellers. Miami, Denver and Houston saw the highest ratio of homes delisted compared with newly listed.The median list price in November nationally was 0.4% lower than November 2024, according to Realtor.com. It was still, however, 36% higher than November 2019, pre-pandemic. New listings were up just 1.7% from a year ago.Price gains are much stronger in refuge markets, like Grand Rapids, Michigan, where they're up 5.5% year over year and St. Louis where they're up 5%. Cleveland, Milwaukee and Pittsburgh round out the top-performing refuge markets, according to the report. Prices in these markets are still 20%-30% lower than the national median. Another troubling trend this fall -- canceled contracts. Roughly 15% of home purchase agreements were canceled in October, up from 14% the year before, according to Redfin. Cancellations are now well above pre-pandemic levels. Regionally, San Antonio saw the most canceled deals, with more than 1 in 5 (21%) pending home sales falling through in October. It was followed by Fort Lauderdale, Florida (20%), Fort Worth, Texas (19.7%), Las Vegas (19.2%) and Jacksonville, Florida (19.2%). The report cited high housing costs as well as economic uncertainty.

    "body": "Paramount Skydance CEO David Ellison at Netflix's \"America's Team: The Gambler and His Cowboys\" at The Egyptian Theatre in Los Angeles, Aug. 11, 2025.Gilbert Flores | Variety | Getty ImagesParamount Skydance laid out its plan Monday to persuade Warner Bros. Discovery shareholders that it's a better buyer for the company than Netflix. The hostile bid kicks off a tug-of-war that could get complicated. Paramount has officially launched a tender offer for current WBD shares at $30 per share, all cash. That bid is backed by $41 billion in equity financing. The remainder will be money from RedBird Capital and Jared Kushner's Affinity Partners. Paramount also has $54 billion in debt commitments from Bank of America, Citi and Apollo Global Management.Paramount's tender offer will be open for 20 business days, Paramount Chief Strategy Officer Andy Gordon said during a conference call for investors Monday. Warner Bros. Discovery has 10 days to respond, and after the 20 business days are up, Paramount has the option to extend the deadline to keep the offer open for WBD shareholders, Gordon said.During this time, any shareholder of WBD can sell its shares to Paramount for $30. If Paramount buys 51% of outstanding shares, it would control the company. \"We do believe the [Paramount] offer should garner meaningful traction,\" Raymond James equity analyst Ric Prentiss wrote in a note to clients. \"That said, we believe that Netflix is committed to this deal; if [Paramount] seems to be gaining traction, we would not be surprised to see a reaction.\"That reaction could come in the form of an increased Netflix offer, though Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos didn't mention as much when speaking Monday at the UBS Global Media and Communications Conference. A prolonged battle could eventually invite lawsuits or proxy fights that would demand full shareholder votes. The WBD board said in a statement Monday it \"is not modifying its recommendation with respect to the agreement with Netflix.\" It advised shareholders \"not to take any action at this time with respect to Paramount Skydance's proposal.\"Still, the board will \"carefully review and consider Paramount Skydance's offer in accordance with the terms of Warner Bros. Discovery's agreement with Netflix, Inc.,\" the board said in its statement. Making a caseIf WBD shareholders seem to be convinced that Paramount's is the superior bid, Warner Bros. Discovery management could restart friendly discussions with Paramount to make sure it's getting the best deal possible. Paramount CEO David Ellison told CNBC's David Faber on Monday that the company's $30-per-share offer was not its \"best and final,\" suggesting Paramount is open to paying more for WBD if discussions begin again.Ellison hopes to convince WBD shareholders that a $30-per-share, all-cash offer is more valuable than Netflix's $27.75-per-share, cash-and-stock offer for WBD's streaming and studio assets. Ellison told CNBC on Monday that he values the linear cable networks, which aren't part of Netflix's bid, at just $1 per share. WBD internally has valued that business at about $3 per share, CNBC previously reported.If WBD reaches a deal with Paramount, WBD would owe Netflix $2.8 billion as a breakup fee — meaning Paramount may have to increase its bid, or agree to pay the fee, to adjust for the added cost. Regulatory jittersEllison said Monday that Paramount's odds for regulatory approval, combined with what he views as a higher bid, should sway shareholders that the WBD board made a mistake in choosing Netflix's offer. A Netflix-HBO max combination would create a streamer \"at such a scale that it would be bad for Hollywood and bad for the consumer,\" said Ellison, noting it would be \"anticompetitive in every way you fundamentally look at it.\"Sarandos disagreed.\"We're super confident we're going to get it across the line and finish,\" Sarandos said Monday at the UBS conference. Sarandos also jabbed Paramount's estimate of $6 billion in synergies, noting those potential cost cuts would likely mean job losses.\"We're not cutting jobs, we're making jobs,\" Sarandos said.",

Scott Olson | Getty ImagesA federal judge on Monday struck down President Donald Trump's sweeping ban on new wind power projects in the U.S., a major victory for an industry that has been singled out by the White House since the administration's first day.Judge Patti Saris of the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts ruled that Trump's ban is \"arbitrary and capricious and contrary to law,\" tossing out the president's action in its entirey.  Trump issued a memorandum on Jan. 20 halting permits and leases for offshore and onshore wind farms, pending federal review. Saris said that federal agencies had failed to provide a reasoned explanation for such a drastic change in U.S. policy. Seventeen states led by New York Attorney General Letitia James sued Trump in May to overturn the president's ban. They argued that it created \"an existential threat to the wind industry.\"watch now\"This is a big victory in our fight to keep tackling the climate crisis and protect one of our best sources of clean, reliable, and affordable energy,\" James said in a post on social media platform X. States in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic in particular have been pursuing offshore wind projects to meet future energy demand as they seek to reduce carbon-dioxide emissions. White House spokeswoman Taylor Rogers said in a statement that \"offshore wind projects were given unfair, preferential treatment while the rest of the energy industry was hindered by burdensome regulations.\"  watch now",

Sean Gallup | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesGoogle on Monday said it plans to launch the first of its AI-powered glasses in 2026, as the tech company ramps up its efforts to compete against Meta in a heating consumer market for AI devices. The Alphabet-owned company is collaborating on hardware design with Samsung, Gentle Monster and Warby Parker, with whom Google agreed to a $150 million commitment in May.Google plans to release audio-only glasses that will allow users to speak with the Gemini artificial-intelligence assistant, the company said in a blog. Google also said there will be glasses with an in-lens display that show users information such as navigation directions and language translations. The company said the first of these glasses will arrive next year, but it did not specify which styles that will include. In a Monday filing, Warby Parker said that the first of its glasses in partnership with Google are expected to launch in 2026.The glasses will be built on top of Android XR, Google's operating system for its headsets.Google's Monday updates come after the company in May announced that it would be getting back into the smart glasses game. At the time, co-founder Sergey Brin said he learned from Google's past mistakes of failed smart glasses, citing less advanced AI and a lack of supply chain knowledge, which led to expensive price points.\"Now, in the AI world, the things these glasses can do to help you out without constantly distracting you — that capability is much higher,\" Brin said in May.The AI wearables space has been gaining traction with Meta leading the pack. the social media company's Ray-Ban Meta glasses were met with surprising success. The glasses, which were designed in partnership with eyewear giant EssilorLuxottica, are infused with the Meta AI digital assistantMeta also released its own display glasses in September, which allows users to see features like messages, photo previews and live captions through a small display that's built into one of the device's lenses. Other companies like Snap and Alibaba have also been churning out their own AI glasses offerings as the small but competitive market continues to grow.Google on Monday also revealed more software updates to the Galaxy XR headset, including the ability to link it to Windows PCs and a travel mode that will allows the device to be used in planes and cars.WATCH: Google's vibe-coding playwatch now",

    "body": "Ray Dalio, founder of Bridgewater, speaking to CNBC at the Future Investment Institute 2025 summit in Riyadh on Oct. 28th, 2025.CNBCThe Middle East is fast emerging as one of the world's most powerful AI hubs, Bridgewater Associates' founder Ray Dalio said Monday, comparing the region's rise to Silicon Valley's pull for all things tech. Speaking to CNBC, Dalio said the United Arab Emirates and its neighbors have combined vast pools of capital with an influx of global talent, creating a magnet for investment managers and AI innovators alike.The UAE and Saudi Arabia have this year launched multibillion-dollar initiatives to build cloud, data centers and other AI infrastructure, underpinned by sovereign-wealth capital and global tech partnerships. A $10 billion agreement between Google Cloud and Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund announced this year aims to create a \"global AI hub\" in the country, as part of a broader push to host data-centers and AI workloads locally.Earlier this year, technology giants OpenAI, Oracle, Nvidia and Cisco combined forces to build a major Stargate artificial intelligence campus in the United Arab Emirates.When asked if he thinks that the UAE, Saudi Arabia and Qatar can be leaders in the AI race, Dalio said, \"What they've done is to create talented people. So this [region] is kind of becoming a Silicon Valley of capitalists ... So now people are coming in … money is coming in, talent is coming in.\"watch nowDalio, who has been visiting Abu Dhabi for more than three decades, said the Gulf's transformation is the result of deliberate statecraft and long-term planning. He described the UAE as \"a paradise in a world that's troubled,\" citing its leadership, stability, quality of life and ambition to build a globally competitive financial ecosystem.\"There's a buzz here, the way there's a buzz in San Francisco, places like that, about AI or technology. It's very similar to that,\" Dalio said.'Precarious' next two yearsThe Bridgewater founder warned that the global economy was headed toward an uncertain future in the near term due to a confluence of multiple forces, reiterating his concerns about markets being in bubble.  \"The next year or two in the future is going to be more precarious,\" he said, pointing to the convergence of what he calls the three dominant cycles: debt, U.S. political conflict and geopolitics.The global debt overhang is already forcing stress into pockets of the market.\"We're seeing cracks in the markets in a number of ways, private equity, venture capital, debt that's being refinanced, and all of those. So we are in a bubble, I believe, by almost all of those measures,\" Dalio said, highlighting similarities with the 2000 bubble but not the one in 1929.He also expects U.S. politics to become more disruptive heading into 2026. \"As we go into the 2026 elections … you will see a lot more conflict in different ways,\" Dalio said, adding that elevated interest rates and concentrated market leadership compound the vulnerability.\"Every country … cannot continue to accumulate the debt they have, yet politically they can't raise taxes and they can't cut benefits. So they're stuck.\" That fiscal bind feeds into a broader rise in domestic polarization: \"We now have populism of the left and populism of the right … which means irreconcilable differences.\"Dalio reiterated his view that the AI rally is in bubble territory, but advised investors not to rush for exits just because valuations are stretched.Concerns about an AI bubble have been swirling in recent months, with notable voices such as OpenAI CEO Sam Altman suggesting that the AI market was in a bubble. Investor Michael Burry, who called the 2008 subprime mortgage crash, has forecast the artificial intelligence market bubble could collapse in the next two years. \"All the bubbles took place in times of great technological change,\" Dalio said. \"You don't want to get out of it just because of the bubble. You want to look for the pricking of the bubble.\"The catalyst for that \"pricking,\" he said, usually comes from a tightening of money or a forced need to sell wealth to meet obligations. He also warned of stress in venture capital, private equity and commercial real estate, sectors where cheap debt is now rolling over at higher rates. ",

    "body": "British Prime Minister Keir Starmer welcomes President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy outside 10 Downing Street ahead of their meeting in London on Dec. 08, 2025. Wiktor Szymanowicz | Future Publishing | Getty ImagesUkraine's European allies on Monday said that the war is at a \"critical moment\" as President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said his country is preparing to share a revised peace plan with the U.S.Zelenskyy met with U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz and French President Emmanuel Macron in London as the European leaders scrambled to ensure that Ukraine's territorial integrity and future security are not compromised in the face of growing U.S. pressure.In a statement following the meeting, Starmer's office said the leaders had discussed \"the importance of the U.S.-led peace talks for European security\" and supported the progress made so far. \"The leaders underscored the need for a just and lasting peace in Ukraine, which includes robust security guarantees,\" Starmer's representatives added. \"The leaders agreed that, while diplomatic efforts continue, Europe must stand with Ukraine, strengthening its ability to defend against relentless attacks.\"Starmer, Merz, Macron and Zelenskyy also discussed \"positive progress\" that had been made on using frozen Russian assets to support Ukraine's reconstruction. The European Commission, the executive arm of the EU, last week proposed using cash from the balances of European financial institutions holding frozen Russian Central Bank assets to support Ukraine with a \"Reparations Loan.\" It also tabled borrowing the funds from international markets, offering member states an alternative to using Russian capital.The U.K. prime minister's office noted that those present in Monday's meeting had also joined a call with other European leaders following the initial talks. \"The leaders all agreed that now is a critical moment and that we must continue to ramp up support to Ukraine and economic pressure on Putin to bring an end to this barbaric war,\" the spokesperson said. U.S. support remains crucialAs the European leaders reiterated their support for Kyiv, Zelenskyy stressed that Ukraine also remained reliant on input from Washington. \"There are some things which we can't manage without the Americans, some things we can't manage without Europe, that's why we need to make some important decisions,\" he said, during a press briefing.However, Merz struck a somewhat cautious tone on U.S. negotiators achieving an imminent breakthrough that would be acceptable to both Ukraine and the wider European continent.\"This could be a decisive time for all of us,\" he told reporters. \"We are trying to continue our support for Ukraine, on the other hand we are seeing these talks and decisions between Moscow and the U.S., I'm looking forward to hearing from [Zelenskyy] what the outcome of these talks might be.\"The U.K. and France have been leading proponents of a \"Coalition of the Willing,\" a group of countries that could be part of a \"reassurance force\" in a post-war Ukraine that helps to guarantee its security.Ukraine is expected to share a revised peace plan with the U.S. after the London talks, according to media reports. The updated plan consists of 20 points after some \"obvious anti-Ukrainian points were removed,\" Zelenskyy said in comments reported by Sky News. He added that he will share the revised plan with the U.S. today.On Sunday, Trump claimed Zelenskyy had not yet read the latest U.S.-backed peace plan yet, though it's unclear which version Trump was referring to.\"We all know that the destiny of this country is the destiny of Europe,\" Merz added on Monday. \"Nobody should doubt our support for Ukraine. I'm skeptical about some of the details which we are seeing in the documents coming from the U.S. side, but we have to talk about that, that's why we are here.\" watch nowAnna Rosenberg, head of geopolitics at Amundi Investment Institute, told CNBC's \"Europe Early Edition\" on Tuesday that negotiations to bring the war to an end seemed to be \"going in circles.\" \"It's a lot of talking back and forth,\" she said. \"Frankly, sometimes I wonder what they keep on talking about, because the sticking points are always the same. It's about territory and it's about the security guarantees, and the security guarantees are arguably more difficult than the territory, but the territory is also difficult for Ukraine.\"Zelenskyy, who also met with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, NATO Chief Mark Rutte and European Council President Antonio Costa in Brussels on Monday, said a key focus of his meetings in Europe was cementing security guarantees from continental allies. Starmer's office said that the leaders who met in London had \"underscored the need for a just and lasting peace in Ukraine, which includes robust security guarantees.\"President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy meets with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte, President of the European Council Antonio Costa, and President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen in Brussels, Belgium on Dec. 9, 2025.Ukrainian Presidency | Anadolu | Getty ImagesLast week, Russian President Vladimir Putin threatened that Moscow would take Ukraine's critical Donbas region \"by force\" if Ukraine does not concede the territory willingly.Rosenberg told CNBC on Tuesday that Kyiv is unlikely to give in to that pressure. \"The territory we're talking about is a critical zone of defense for Ukraine, which, if Ukraine gives it up, would make it much easier for Russia to go deeper into Ukraine, because it's a so-called fortress belt of heavy fortification,\" she explained. \"Behind that fortress belt, there's a plane you can easily enter with military. So, Ukraine is going to hold on to that for as long as they can. They will only give up on the territory once they feel confident. They have security guarantees that will give them confidence that there's not going to be an attack in a couple of months or years down the line.\"— Tasmin Lockwood contributed to this report.",

    "body": "NVIDIA AI Computing Card captured in Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province, China on Dec. 9, 2025.Cfoto | Future Publishing | Getty ImagesU.S. authorities announced Tuesday that they have shut down yet another China-linked smuggling network that trafficked or attempted to traffic more than $160 million in export-controlled Nvidia AI chips.According to a press release from the U.S. Attorney's Office, two businessmen were taken into custody, while a Houston-based company and its owner have already pleaded guilty to chip smuggling as part of the wider investigation.The case comes as Washington steps up its enforcement of export controls aimed at curbing China's access to advanced AI technologies, including Nvidia's Graphics Processing Units. The operation, dubbed \"Operation Gatekeeper,\" exposed efforts to funnel cutting-edge AI chips — with military and civilian applications — to entities that could undermine U.S. national security, according to a statement from U.S. Attorney Nicholas J. Ganjei for the Southern District of Texas.Newly unsealed documents show that Alan Hao Hsu, 43, of Missouri City, Texas, and his company, Hao Global LLC, pleaded guilty to smuggling and unlawful export activities on Oct. 10. Officials said Hsu and associates had exported or attempted to export at least $160 million worth of Nvidia H100 and H200 GPUs between October 2024 and May 2025.The H200 and H100 models, while not Nvidia's most advanced chips, still require a special license to be shipped to China under current controls.Hsu's operation allegedly falsified shipping documents to misclassify the GPUs and hide their true destinations, including China, Hong Kong and other prohibited locations. Investigators traced more than $50 million in funds originating from China to help fund the scheme by Hsu and Hao Global.Hsu, who remains free on bond, faces up to 10 years in prison at his Feb. 18 sentencing, while Hao Global could be hit with fines up to twice its illicit gains plus probation. In a statement shared with CNBC, an Nvidia spokesperson said that export controls remain rigorous and that \"even sales of older generation products on the secondary market are subject to strict scrutiny and review.\"\"While millions of controlled GPUs are in service at businesses, homes, and schools, we will continue to work with the government and our customers to ensure that second-hand smuggling does not occur,\" the spokesperson said.Relabeled Nvidia GPUsU.S. officials also charged Fanyue Gong, 43, a Chinese citizen residing in New York, and Benlin Yuan, 58, a Canadian citizen living in Ontario, as part of their investigation.Yuan serves as CEO of a U.S. subsidiary of a Beijing-headquartered Chinese IT company, while Gong owns a New York technology firm. Both allegedly conspired independently with a Hong Kong logistics company and a China-based AI firm to evade chip controls.Prosecutors alleged Gong used straw purchasers and intermediaries to acquire GPUs by misrepresenting the end customers as being in the U.S. or in unrestricted third countries.Workers at U.S. warehouses would then rebrand shipments under fictitious names and mislabel them as generic parts for export to China and Hong Kong, according to the case. Meanwhile, Yuan is accused of recruiting inspectors for the Hong Kong firm, instructing them to conceal Chinese destinations, devising cover stories to release detained shipments, and providing false information to authorities. He also allegedly handled storage for additional GPU exports.If convicted, Yuan could face up to 20 years for conspiracy to violate the Export Control Reform Act, while Gong could receive as much as 10 years for conspiracy to smuggle.The investigation involved the Commerce Department's Bureau of Industry and Security, which oversees and enforces U.S. export controls, including those on Nvidia. The case comes amid a flurry of similar busts regarding unauthorized Nvidia exports in recent months. Lawmakers have been attempting to tighten oversight of U.S. chip controls following reports of loopholes in existing rules.However, the U.S. President signaled this week that he would allow Nvidia to ship its H200 chips to \"approved customers\" in China and elsewhere, on the condition that Washington gets a 25% cut on the profits.Although the H200 isn't state-of-the-art in Nvidia's lineup, it would become the most advanced model available to China and could help satiate demand for AI compute power in the country. ",

Evelyn Hockstein | ReutersHouse Democrats are forming a commission on artificial intelligence to position themselves as leaders on the issue as AI companies train their focus — and campaign contributions — on Washington, D.C.The House Democratic Commission on AI and the Innovation Economy, set to begin meeting this month, will work with AI companies, stakeholders and congressional committees that oversee aspects of the sector to help develop policy expertise. The commission is a response to the growing presence of AI policy and AI companies around Washington. AI companies are ramping up lobbying, opening offices close to the Capitol, and launching campaigns through a super PAC with at least $100 million to spend on the midterms elections in 2026.There has been a growing debate over AI, specifically related to an increasing number of individual state laws that could conflict with a federal standard. OpenAI, Andreessen Horowitz and Google are lobbying to block state laws that regulate AI. Democrats have largely opposed that push. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., in a statement shared with CNBC about the working group, said that Democrats are \"ready, willing and able to lean into those issues so we can uplift the health, safety and economic well-being of the American people.\"House Democratic Caucus vice-chair Ted Lieu, D-Calif., participates in the House Democrats' post-caucus news conference in the U.S. Capitol on Tuesday, July 23, 2024. Bill Clark | CQ-Roll Call, Inc. | Getty ImagesRep. Ted Lieu of California, Rep. Josh Gottheimer of New Jersey, and Rep. Valerie Foushee of North Carolina will lead the commission. Rep. Zoe Lofgren of California and Rep. Frank Pallone of Massachusetts, the top Democrats on committees that cover AI, will serve as ex-officio co-chairs. All House Democrats will be invited to participate. Lieu drew a line between how Republicans and Democrats have handled AI issues.He slammed the Trump administration for proposing to sell advanced chips to China, striking revenue-sharing agreements, and posting deepfake videos. Trump announced Monday that he will allow Nvidia to send advanced H200 chips to \"approved customers\" in China and elsewhere. \"House Democrats reject this misguided approach, which risks leaving Americans vulnerable and our competitiveness weakened,\" Liu said in a statement. \"Instead, Democrats will meet the moment by working with all stakeholders to develop smart, durable solutions that strengthen innovation and protect the public.\"Gottheimer said the group also wants to find ways to keep the U.S. \"ahead of the curve\" when it comes to AI and work with the larger industry.\"We need to ensure Congress is educated on these new technologies, that we're putting the right policies and guardrails in place to grow and protect Americans,\" he said in a statement.The House previously had a bipartisan task force on AI that issued a report in December 2024, which laid out recommendations for action at both the Congressional and executive levels.

    "body": "Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg makes a keynote speech at the Meta Connect annual event at the company's headquarters in Menlo Park, Calif., on Sept. 25, 2024.Manuel Orbegozo | ReutersMeta CEO Mark Zuckerberg was so optimistic last year about his company's Llama family of artificial intelligence models that he predicted they would become the \"most advanced in the industry\" and \"bring the benefits of AI to everyone.\"But after including a whole section on Llama in his opening remarks during Meta's earnings call in January of this year, he mentioned the brand name only once on the latest call in October. The company's obsession with its open-source large language model has given way to a very different approach to AI, one focused around a multibillion-dollar hiring spree to bring in top industry talent that could help Meta take on the likes of OpenAI, Google and Anthropic. As 2025 comes to a close, Meta's strategy remains scattershot, according to insiders and industry experts, feeding the perception that the company has fallen further behind its top AI rivals, whose models are rapidly gaining adoption in the consumer and enterprise markets. Meta is pursuing a new Llama successor and frontier AI model, codenamed Avocado, CNBC has learned. People with knowledge of the matter said many within the company were expecting the model to be released before the end of this year, but that the plan now is for that to happen in the first quarter of 2026. The model is wrestling with various training-related performance testing intended to ensure the system is well-received when it eventually debuts, said the people, who asked not to be named because they weren't authorized to speak on the matter.\"Our model training efforts are going according to plan and have had no meaningful timing changes,\" a Meta spokesperson said in a statement.With its stock underperforming the broader tech sector this year and badly trailing Google parent Alphabet, Wall Street is looking for a sense of direction and a path to a return on investment after Meta spent $14.3 billion in June to hire Scale AI founder Alexandr Wang and a handful of his top engineers and researchers. Four months after that announcement, which included Meta purchasing a big stake in Scale, the social media company raised its 2025 guidance for capital expenditures to between $70 billion and $72 billion from a prior range of $66 billion to $72 billion. \"In many ways, Meta has been the opposite of Alphabet, where it entered the year as an AI winner and now faces more questions around investment levels and ROI,\" analysts at KeyBanc Capital Markets wrote in a November note to clients. The firm recommends buying both stocks. watch nowAt the heart of Meta's challenge is the sustained dominance of its core business: digital advertising. Even with annual sales in excess of $160 billion, Meta's ad targeting business, driven by massive improvements in AI and the popularity of Instagram, is growing revenue north of 20% a year. Investors have lauded the company for using AI to bolster the strength of its cash cow and to make the organization more efficient and less bloated. But Zuckerberg has much grander ambitions, and the new guard he's brought in to push the future vision of AI has no background in online ads. The 41-year-old founder, with a net worth of over $230 billion, has suggested that if Meta doesn't take big swings, it risks becoming an afterthought in a world that's poised to be defined by AI.Until recently, Meta's unique position in AI was the open-source nature of its Llama models. Unlike other AI models, Meta's technology was made freely available so third-party researchers and others could access the tools and ultimately improve them.\"Today, several tech companies are developing leading closed models,\" Zuckerberg wrote in a blog post in July 2024. \"But open source is quickly closing the gap.\"He's since started changing his tune. Zuckerberg hinted over the summer that Meta was considering shaking up its approach to open source after the April release of Llama 4, which failed to captivate developers. Zuckerberg said in July that, \"We'll need to be rigorous about mitigating these risks and careful about what we choose to open source.\"Avocado, when it's eventually made available, could be a proprietary model, according to people familiar with the matter. That means outside developers wouldn't be able to freely download its so-called weights and related software components. Some at Meta were upset that the R1 model released by Chinese AI lab DeepSeek earlier this year incorporated pieces of Llama's architecture, the people said, further underscoring the risks of open source and hammering home the idea that the company should overhaul its strategy. The company's high-priced AI hires and leaders of the recently launched Meta Superintelligence Labs, or MSL, have also questioned the open-source AI strategy and favored creating a more powerful proprietary AI model, CNBC reported in July. A Meta spokesperson said at the time that the company's \"position on open source AI is unchanged.\"The Llama 4 flub was a significant catalyst in Zuckerberg's pivot, the people said, and also led to a major internal shakeup. Chris Cox, Meta's chief product officer and a 20-year company veteran who was hired as its 13th software engineer, no longer oversees the AI division, formally known as the GenAI unit, after the botched release, the people said. Zuckerberg went on a spending spree to retool Meta's AI leadership. He landed on Wang, then Scale AI's 28-year-old CEO, who was named Meta's new chief AI officer and, in August, became the head of an elite unit called TBD Lab. Avocado is being developed inside TBD, people familiar with the matter said. Alexandr Wang, CEO of ScaleAI speaks on CNBC's Squawk Box outside the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland on Jan. 23, 2025.Gerry Miller | CNBCOpenAI CEO Sam Altman said in June that Meta was trying to lure talent from his company with gigantic pay packages, including sky-high $100 million signing bonuses, which Meta said at the time was a misrepresentation.Along with Wang came other tech bigwigs, including former GitHub CEO Nat Friedman, who heads the product and applied research arm of MSL, and Shengjia Zhao, who was a ChatGPT co-creator. They've brought with them modern methods that have become the standard for frontier AI development in Silicon Valley, and have upended the traditional software development process inside Meta, the people said. Meta's AI culture shiftWang is now under pressure to deliver a top-tier AI model that helps the company regain momentum against rivals like OpenAI, Anthropic and Google, the people said. That pressure has only increased as competitors stepped up their game. Google's Gemini 3, unveiled last month, has drawn solid reviews from users and analysts. OpenAI recently announced new updates to its GPT-5 AI model, while Anthropic debuted its Claude Opus 4.5 model in November shortly after releasing two other major models.Analysts previously told CNBC that there's no clear leading AI model, because some perform better on certain tasks like conversations or coding. But the one constant is that all of the major model creators have to spend a lot of money on AI to maintain any competitive edge, they said. A hefty dose of that spending lines the pockets of Nvidia, the leading developer of AI graphics processing units. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang laid out the state of play during his company's earnings call in November, after the chipmaker reported 62% year-over-year revenue growth. He highlighted a number of model developers as big customers, including Elon Musk's xAI.\"We run OpenAI. We run Anthropic. We run xAI because of our deep partnership with Elon and xAI,\" Huang said. \"We run Gemini. We run Thinking Machines. Let's see, what else do we run? We run them all.\"At no point did Huang reference Llama, although elsewhere on the call he said Meta's Gem, \"a foundation model for ad recommendations trained on large-scale GPU clusters,\" drove an improvement in ad conversions at Meta in the second quarter.  Wang isn't the only Meta exec feeling the heat. Friedman has also been tasked with producing a breakout AI product, the people said. He was responsible for Meta's September launch of Vibes, a feed of AI-generated short videos, which is widely viewed as inferior to OpenAI's Sora 2, they said. Former employees and creators told CNBC that the product was rushed to market and lacked key features, like the ability to generate realistic lip-synced audio.Although Vibes has attracted more interest to the company's standalone Meta AI app, it trails the Sora app as measured by downloads, according to data provided to CNBC by Appfigures.Pressure is being felt across Meta's AI organizations, where 70-hour workweeks have become the norm, the people said, while teams have also been hit with layoffs and restructurings throughout the year. In October, Meta cut 600 jobs in MSL to reduce layers and operate more quickly. Those layoffs impacted employees in areas like the Fundamental Artificial Intelligence Research unit, or FAIR, and played a key role in Chief AI Scientist Yann LeCun's decision to leave the company to launch a startup, according to people with knowledge of the matter.LeCun declined to comment. Yann LeCun, Meta's former chief AI scientist, says people move on.Getty ImagesZuckerberg's high-stakes decision to turn to outsiders like Wang and Friedman to lead the company's AI efforts represented a major change for a company that's historically promoted long-tenured workers to top posts, the people said.In Wang and Friedman, Zuckerberg has handed the controls to experts in infrastructure and related systems, rather than consumer apps. The new leaders also brought a different management style and one that's unfamiliar inside Meta. In particular, insiders told CNBC that Wang and Friedman are more cloistered in their communications, a contrast to a historically open approach of sharing work and chatting on the company's Workplace internal social network Members of Wang's TBD Lab, who work near Zuckerberg's office, don't use Workplace, people familiar said, adding that they're not even on the network and that the group operates like a separate startup. However, Zuckerberg isn't giving the new AI leadership team complete autonomy. Engineering vice president Aparna Ramani, who has been with Meta for nearly a decade, has been put in charge of overseeing the distribution of computing resources for MSL, the people said.And in October, Vishal Shah was moved from leading the company's metaverse initiatives within Reality Labs, where he'd been for four years, to a new role as vice president of AI Products, working with Friedman. Shah is considered a loyal lieutenant who has helped act as a bridge between the company's traditional social apps like Instagram and newer projects like Reality Labs, the people said. Meta confirmed last week that it plans to cut resources to its virtual reality and related metaverse initiatives, shifting its attention to its popular AI-infused glasses developed with EssilorLuxottica.'Demo, don't memo'One of the biggest points of tension between the old and the new is in the realm of software development, people familiar with the matter said. In creating products, Meta has traditionally sought input from numerous groups responsible for areas like front-end user interface, design, algorithmic feeds and privacy, the people said. The multi-step process was intended to ensure some level of uniformity among the company's apps that attract billions of users each day. But the many internal tools built over the years to help coders create software and features weren't developed to accommodate foundation models. Meta's new AI leaders, notably Friedman, view them as bottlenecks slowing down what should be a rapid-fire development process, the people said.Friedman has called for MSL to use newer tools that have been calibrated to incorporate multiple AI models and various kinds of coding automation software often called AI agents, the people said. \"They have this mantra now saying 'Demo, don't memo,'\" Lovable CEO Anton Osika said in October at the Masters of Scale Summit in San Francisco, about Meta's new development process.Osika said Meta employees have been using Lovable's tools to more quickly build internal apps, specifically referencing the company's finance teams, which have turned to Lovable to create software for tracking headcount and planning.  An illustration photo shows the event of Meta launching the Vibes platform, Suqian City, Jiangsu Province, China on September 26, 2025. Cfoto | Future Publishing | Getty ImagesWhile Meta continues retooling its app development methods and pushes toward releasing Avocado, the company has been experimenting with other AI models on its products. Vibes, for instance, relied on AI models from Black Forest Labs and Midjourney, a startup that counts Friedman as an advisor. Meta is also altering its approach to infrastructure, and is increasingly turning to third-party cloud computing services like CoreWeave and Oracle for developing and testing AI features as it builds out its own massive data centers, the people said. The social media giant announced in October that it signed a joint venture agreement with Blue Owl Capital as part of a $27 billion deal to help fund and develop the gargantuan Hyperion data center in Richland Parish, Louisiana. The company said at the time that the partnership provides the \"the speed and flexibility\" Meta needs to build the data center and support its \"long-term AI ambitions.\"Despite the company's challenges in 2025, Zuckerberg's message to employees and investors is that he's more committed than ever to winning. At the top of the company's earnings call in October, Zuckerberg said MSL is \"off to a strong start.\"\"I think that we've already built the lab with the highest talent density in the industry,\" Zuckerberg said. \"We're heads down developing our next generation of models and products and I'm looking forward to sharing more on that front over the coming months.\"WATCH: Data center demand driving infrastructure creditwatch now",

The facility will manufacture semiconductor products for the AI, automotive, computing and data storage industries, according to Tata Electronics. The firm is also building new facilities for assembly and testing. India, despite being one of the world's largest consumers of electronics, lacks chip design or fabrication capabilities. However, the Indian government has been working to change that as part of efforts to reduce dependence on chip imports and capture a bigger share of the global electronics market, which is shifting away from China. Under New Delhi's \"India Semiconductor Mission,\" at least 10 semiconductor projects have been approved with a cumulative investment of over $18 billion.Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan said the partnership with Intel was a \"tremendous opportunity\" to rapidly grow in one of the world's fastest-growing computer markets, fueled by rising PC demand and rapid AI adoption across India.",

Kamil Krzaczynski | Afp | Getty ImagesUnited Airlines is joining Delta Air Lines in holding steady its requirements to earn elite frequent flyer status next year after it raised the bar in 2025.Airlines have spent years making it more expensive to get high-tier status, which comes with perks like early boarding, free first-class upgrades (when they're available), waived baggage fees or even airport lounge access.But hordes of elite travelers in the wake of the pandemic — when airlines let many customers hold onto their status — have meant more crowded early boarding groups. And a rise in premium credit card-toting customers has led to longer waits at some airport lounges than at TSA checkpoints.Airline executives have also said that more customers are willing to pay cash to sit in first class, making fewer seats available for complimentary upgrades that are a draw for many consumers to chase status.watch nowFor United, its program is more in balance now, said Luc Bondar, president of United's MileagePlus loyalty program. \"When you have benefits like upgrades, if everyone has status, then … fewer and fewer customers are going to get access to upgrades,\" he said in an interview. \"We feel good that they're at the right level.\"Read more CNBC airline newsDelta says government shutdown cost it $200 million, but forecasts strong travel demand into 2026The government shutdown is over.

Can it catch up?United is making some changes next year, when the status flyers earn will apply to travel in 2027. The airline is changing how its so-called Plus Points — a currency beyond regular miles that can be earned by top-tier Platinum and 1K loyalty program elites — can be used. The carrier currently has a mileage chart, where customers need to earn set amounts for certain cabins, like its top Polaris long-haul business class. In 2027, it will move instead to dynamic pricing based on demand. United next year will also allow elites with high-level 1K status to earn Plus Points through co-branded credit card spending.The carrier also said status holders and United Chase credit card holders will also have \"increased access\" to Polaris Saver Award fares, which the airline said will make it easier to book in the top cabin.Airlines' lucrative loyalty programs bring in billions in profits, in part when the carriers sell miles to banks when customers earn them through credit card spending. Last year, United raised the amount customers had to spend to reach frequent flyer status in 2026. The thresholds to reach elite status in the airline's MileagePlus program went up about 25% and include either spending on a co-branded card or a combination of spending and flying.Last week, Delta said it would keep its earning requirements the same next year for 2027 status.American Airlines hasn't announced a change to its frequent flyer program elite thresholds this year. The carrier trails Delta and United in profits and is trying to win over more big spenders with refreshed cabins and lounges, though its rivals' decision to hold elite-earning requirements steady could pressure American to do the same.",

The general public remains unconvinced. That's according to a report published Tuesday by nonprofit group Just Capital, examining how different groups are feeling about the potential risks and benefits of AI adoption. Between Sept. 27 and Nov. 14, Just Capital collected data from institutional investors and analysts, corporate executives and U.S. adults.Roughly 93% of corporate leaders and 80% of investors said they believe AI will have a net positive impact on society within the next five years, according to the report. Only 58% of respondents from the public said they share that sentiment. The survey lands three years after OpenAI kickstarted the generative AI rush with the launch of ChatGPT, sparking a flood of investments into AI infrastructure, startups and products. With some analysts forecasting that AI spending will reach into the trillions of dollars by the end of the decade, the boom is boosting excitement about economic advancement and the future of technology while simultaneously raising concerns about privacy, safety and job security.The disparate views are particularly noticeable when looking at AI in the workplace.Just 47% of the general public said they think AI will have a positive net impact on worker productivity, compared to 94% of investors and 98% of corporate leaders.

Only 20% of corporate leaders agreed. Conversely, 64% of executives said AI will help workers be more productive in their current jobs, while only 23% of the public agreed. \"The survey findings reveal widespread public concern that companies' growing adoption of AI will have swift, direct consequences for workers through job cuts,\" Just Capital said. All three categories of respondents are concerned about safety and security risks that could stem from AI, but corporate leaders and investors are especially worried about disinformation and malicious use of the technology. In addition to those categories, the public is also fears loss of control and the environmental impact of AI. More than 40% of corporate leaders said environmental issues are not being factored into their AI deployment strategy, according to the report. Roughly 60% of investors and half of the public said companies should spend more than 5% of their total AI investment on safety, while 59% of corporate leaders said they should spend up to 5%.

    "body": "The Jefferies Financial Group Inc. headquarters in New York, US, on Monday, Oct. 20, 2025. Michael Nagle | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesThe U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating Jefferies' relationship into bankrupt auto parts maker First Brands Group, The Financial Times reported Thursday. The newspaper, citing people with knowledge of the matter, said the regulator is looking into whether Jefferies gave investors enough information on its Point Bonita fund's exposure to the failed auto business. The inquiry into internal controls and potential conflicts within the bank is at an early stage, the report said. It's not clear whether it will result in any allegations of wrongdoing. Jefferies came under pressure last month after its exposure to First Brands — which collapsed under a series of complex debt agreements — raised fears of other bad loans on Wall Street.

When asked for comment, an SEC spokesperson said the agency \"does not comment on the existence or nonexistence of a possible investigation.\"Jefferies did not respond to CNBC's request for comment.

    "body": "In 2019, Chanel Rivers took a trip to London that would change the entire trajectory of her life.Born and raised in New York, Rivers, now 35, says she was tired of the dating scene and worrying about her safety in the Big Apple. She booked a trip to London with a friend and realized how comfortable she felt walking around the city, something she no longer felt in New York.\"I remember just walking around London and being like, 'I feel like this is where I'm supposed to be.' It was a feeling that came over me,\" Rivers says. \"In London, I just feel like my anxiety has lessened a lot, which is great.\"Shortly after Rivers got back to New York, she started figuring out how to return to London permanently, but the Covid-19 pandemic brought her plans to a complete halt. During the pandemic, Rivers met her now fiancé, Martin, an architect from Canada who was living and working in New York.Rivers was born and raised in New York.Chanel RiversAfter four and a half years of dating, Rivers brought up moving to London again to her fiancé. She admits that the feeling of wanting to move didn't go away, and she didn't see herself being in New York long-term anymore.\"I considered Canada, and we did look at Vancouver, but it was not city enough for me. Being from New York, I needed a big city. London was always the plan for me in my heart,\" she says.Around the same time that Rivers brought up getting the move to London going, her fiancé's job offered him a position in their office there. It was something she says was \"very serendipitous but meant to be.\"Since Martin was already a U.K. citizen, Rivers only needed to apply for a partner visa, which was approved in March 2024.Chanel is part of small but growing trend of Americans relocating to the U.K. More than 6,000 U.S. citizens applied to either become British subjects or to live and work in the country indefinitely from March 2024 to March 2025, the most since the U.K.'s Home Office began keeping records in 2004, according to The Guardian.Hello, LondonIn October 2024, the couple moved into a two-bedroom, one-bathroom apartment with a private garden in West London without ever seeing it in person. The rent was 2,400 pounds or USD $3,159 when they first moved in and has since increased to 2,515.20 pounds or $3,311, according to documents reviewed by CNBC Make It.The apartment was unfurnished, in a townhouse rather than a larger building, and didn't have a doorman, unlike the modern one they lived in back in New York City. The couple didn't ship any of their furniture over because it was too expensive. The first night they spent in the apartment, they slept in sleeping bags on the floor and used their suitcases as a dining table.\"We wanted something with character. We told ourselves we wanted something different when we moved here and we wanted something that felt very London so that we had a different living experience than we did in the U.S.,\" Rivers says.Rivers, her fiancé and their dog moved to London in October 2024.Chanel RiversRivers was able to keep her $120,000 a year job in event planning and marketing through the end of 2024.After that, she started looking for a position in London, which she says helped her explore the city as she traveled for interviews and worked out of local coffee shops. Rivers says she never had homesickness or regretted the move, but she admits that she was still nervous about being in a new city. \"I was so intimidated by London because it's so big and I was kind of scared to go out on my own. I don't know what happened to that brave girl from 2019, but I guess everything just felt so real now, and it was hitting me,\" she adds.One year later and the cost of living in LondonNow that Rivers and her fiancé have lived in London for a little over a year, they have settled in nicely, she says. Rivers found a London-based job working as an event planner. Rivers did not want to disclose her salary, but says that although she did take a pay cut, she's happy with it and spends less money than she did while living in New York. \"I've found that I generally spend less now, mostly because I'm not socializing as much as I did in New York. In London, life is a bit quieter but in a good way,\" she says. \"I still make time to see new friends and meet new people but I go out less. Plus, since I earn less here, I'm more mindful about where my money goes.\"Rivers and her fiancé also split their expenses proportionally based on their incomes. \"My fiancé makes the equivalent of what he made in the U.S., so he's kind of carrying the team right now, which is great,\" she adds.Rivers and her fiancé moved into an apartment without seeing it in person.Chanel RiversRivers' share of the monthly living expenses breakdown is as follows, according to documents reviewed by CNBC Make It:Rent = 1,215 pounds or $1,599Cellphone = 49.70 pounds or $65Internet/Wi-Fi = 20 pounds or $26Water = 59.78 pounds or $79Electricity = 121 pounds or $159Groceries = 300 pounds or $395Transportation = 115 pounds or $151Amazon Prime = 8.99 pounds or $12Pet insurance = 25.21 pounds or $33Apple TV = $12.99Rivers' biggest monthly expenses are rent, groceries and electricity, she says. She commutes to the office three times a week and tends to buy lunch on those days. Since moving to London, Rivers and her fiancé say they have also been able to take advantage of the city's location by taking local day trips on the train and traveling to Ireland and Mallorca. \"It's really nice to have easier access to traveling. I feel like in the U.S., you go on a trip once a year and that's it. It's nice that we can hop on a train and go to Paris for a night or hop on a plane and go to Spain,\" she says. \"The traveling is also a big part of why we wanted to move. Despite it taking a while to get settled, Rivers says she feels they made the right decision.\"I've only felt like this is the right path and where I'm supposed to be. Even the mundane things I do here excite me,\" she says. \"I feel like I'm probably in a honeymoon phase but I feel every day that I made the right choice. I don't think I see myself living in the U.S. now that I know what it's like to live a lifestyle outside of that.\"Rivers says she doesn't see herself moving back to the U.S.Chanel RiversRivers says moving back to the U.S. probably isn't in the cards for her, but she could eventually get on board with moving to Canada after living out her London dream for a few more years. \"Canada wasn't as exciting for where I'm at in life right now. I wanted something a little bit more exciting, like New York, but different. I think when I get older, if we were to move back and we wanted to be closer to family, then Canada would be the place we move to,\" she says.Conversions from British Pounds to USD were done using the OANDA conversion rate of 0.76 pounds to $1 USD on Nov. 11, 2025.

    "body": "In this pool photograph distributed by the Russian state agency Sputnik, Russia's President Vladimir Putin attends a meeting of the Collective Security Treaty Organisation (CSTO) Heads of State Council at the Yntymak Ordo (Palace of Unity) presidential residence in Bishkek on November 27, 2025. Alexander Kazakov | Afp | Getty ImagesRussian President Vladimir Putin has broken his silence on a U.S.-backed peace plan to end the war in Ukraine, saying Moscow is ready for \"serious\" discussions about the draft proposals.Putin said Thursday that the outlines of a fledgling peace plan that has been reached by the U.S. and Ukraine could be the basis of a deal that ends the almost four-year long conflict.\"In general, we agree that this can be the basis for future agreements,\" Putin said in comments made during a trip to Kyrgyzstan and translated by Reuters.The president added that the U.S. appeared to be taking Russia's position on a peace settlement \"into account\" and that Moscow was ready for \"serious discussions\" when U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff travels to Moscow next week for talks.It's the first time Putin has publicly addressed a peace plan since a flurry of diplomacy between the U.S. and Ukraine in the last few days. Those talks came after reports last week of a U.S.-Russia devised 28-point peace plan, which appeared to heavily favor Russia's demands.  Ukraine and its European allies' scrambled to mount a response, amending the plan and inserting counter proposals which were discussed in Geneva last weekend with a U.S. delegation led by U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio. All eyes on RussiaThe current draft plan, which has reportedly been slimmed down to 19 key proposals, appears to have received Ukraine's tentative backing, putting the ball back in Russia's court as to whether it could accept the framework and build upon it.On Wednesday, Putin's close aide Yuri Ushakov had claimed that Russia had not even seen an official version of the latest U.S.-backed draft deal for Ukraine, but that it had seen an unofficial version.Regarding the plan it had seen, Ushakov said the Kremlin viewed some aspects of the plan positively while \"several of its points require serious analysis.\"Sergei Ryabkov, Russia's deputy foreign minister, said Moscow welcomed U.S. efforts on peace proposals but said \"there are no concessions on key issues on the Ukraine settlement,\" suggesting there could be some distance to travel before a deal is actually reached. Putin's Press Secretary Dmitry Peskov warned on Wednesday against jumping to conclusions regarding an end to the war, which Russia launched when it invaded Ukraine in Feb. 2022.\"Wait. It's too early to say that,\" Peskov told reporters, state news agency TASS reported, when asked whether this was the closest Russia and Ukraine had ever been to concluding a peace agreement. Putin on Thursday praised Russian advances in Ukraine and told reporters that the fighting in Ukraine would stop only when Ukrainian troops withdraw from their positions in key areas. If they did not do so, then Russian forces would achieve their objectives by force, he added, appearing to suggest that Moscow was not willing to give up one of its key objectives in the war (and contained within the initial peace plan secretly drafted with the U.S.) which was to have full control of Ukraine's eastern Donbas region.CNBC has contacted the Kremlin for further comment and is awaiting a response.Ukraine on board, tentativelyMultiple outlets reported Tuesday that a Ukrainian delegation that had held talks with U.S. officials in Abu Dhabi on Tuesday appeared to tentatively support the basis of a U.S.-backed peace plan — though key details remained unresolved.ABC News and CBS News both reported an unnamed U.S. official had said that the Ukrainians \"have agreed\" to the deal, while adding there were still points that had to be ironed out. It was unclear if both stories quoted the same U.S. official.Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said later Tuesday that Kyiv was ready to advance the peace framework, Reuters reported, citing a copy of a speech the president gave to a coalition of allied countries.U.S. President Donald Trump said at the White House on Tuesday, \"I think we're getting very close to a deal. We'll find out ... I think we're making progress.\"In a Truth Social post later Tuesday afternoon, Trump said, \"there are only a few remaining points of disagreement.\"",

Michael Nagle | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesBlack Friday is proving more popular for younger consumers than for their elders, according to a new report provided exclusively to CNBC.AT&T Business' 2025 Holiday Shopping Survey, conducted by Morning Consult, found that 40% of Generation Z members and 32% of millennials plan to do most of their shopping on Black Friday. Older generations, on the other hand, prefer to shop later in the season, just a week or two before Christmas, the survey found.  \"Black Friday is always such a big deal, and the pricing and the offers and advertising that's done during that time is probably what would draw Gen Z, especially things done on social media,\" said Angela Rutherford, AT&T's vice president of mid-market sales.The enthusiasm for Black Friday comes even as Gen Z plans to pull back their spending. Read more CNBC Black Friday newsShoppers curtail Black Friday spending: 'They are using every tool that they can,' expert saysBlack Friday is most popular with Gen Z, even as the holiday loses its shine, new survey findsBlack Friday car deals are sparser this year, analyst says: ‘Buyers may be a little disappointed’Pro: Wall Street’s favorite holiday shopping stocks as Black Friday nearsConsulting firm PwC reported in September that Gen Z shoppers plan to spend 23% less on average this holiday season than a year ago – the sharpest decline of any generation and a significant change from the previous year, when Gen Z said they planned to spend 37% more.And as non-wealthy Americans face pressures of higher prices and economic uncertainty, some reports are showing signs of a \"K-shaped\" economy that may stretch into the holiday season, with wealthier consumers spending more and lower-income consumers shopping more conservatively.A new Deloitte survey found that consumers at large plan to spend 4% less on Black Friday than they did last year, primarily due to concerns of financial constraints and a higher cost of living.Still, Rutherford said consumers are being more \"intentional and value-driven\" in their holiday shopping this year. That spending is translating into more support for small businesses rather than large legacy retailers, with 77% of consumers reporting they would do all of their holiday shopping at small businesses if they could and if the pricing was the same, according to AT&T's survey. Compared with last year, the number of survey respondents who said they shop at small businesses to boost their local economies grew by 8 percentage points. \"I think there's a price consciousness out there, combined with a, 'If I can still save money or get a good price, I will still shop local,' type of mentality out there,\" Rutherford said. The AT&T survey also found that 72% of people reported getting their gift ideas from in-person shopping rather than from social media. And even as artificial intelligence begins to reshape the way people shop, more than half of shoppers said they were more likely to use traditional online search methods for their gifting this holiday season than AI – just 9% of those surveyed said they are more likely to use AI to find gifts. \"AI has exploded over the last couple years, and it's infiltrating all aspects of life,\" Rutherford said. \"I think as time goes on, you will see a shift from the traditional search to AI for shopping.\"",

    "body": "We're often inundated with relationship advice that rarely captures the complexity of what actually makes love work.As a couples counselor with a decade of experience working with couples and individuals trying to find and stay in love, I've found that one of the most underrated signs of a healthy and resilient relationship is a concept called \"mutual influence.\"Coined by married psychologists Drs. John and Julie Gottman, mutual influence means that you are willing to let your partner's needs, vulnerabilities, and perspectives shape you, and even change something about your own behavior.This quality generally only comes into focus during moments of tension or disagreement, not during easy harmony. At the beginning of a relationship, everyone is usually on their best behavior, which can make this valuable green flag hard to spot early on. Here's how to identify and develop it in your own relationship.  What mutual influence looks like In a 2020 study, psychologists followed nearly 320 couples and found that when both partners felt their voice truly mattered and could genuinely impact the other, relationship quality stayed high and emotional security deepened over the years. Couples who ignored this dynamic stagnated and became more insecure as their satisfaction with their relationship eroded.​When both partners experience mutual influence, the psychologists found that relationships not only feel fairer, but they actually are more stable and loving. Individuals report less anxiety about their partner's commitment, and small conflicts are less likely to snowball into chronic gridlock.This is what mutual influence looks like in practice:Setting your phone aside when your partner says, \"I need you to really hear me right now.\"Going a different route on a road trip because your partner feels anxious about traffic, even if you think your way is faster. Deciding to spend the holidays with their family this year after hearing how much it means to them, even though your tradition was always different. Choosing to pause a personal project for the evening because your partner asks for some help finishing theirs. Switching off the lights when they mention they have a headache.Accepting their feedback about how you speak during disagreements and choosing to change your tone or words, not because you have to, but because you want them to feel safer and closer to you. Mutual influence isn't about giving up your identity in your relationship or shelving what you need for the sake of keeping the peace. True openness means maintaining your values, while still making room for your partner's experience, especially when the two of you don't see eye-to-eye. You are creating a shared life where both of your voices matter.How to develop mutual influence in your relationshipEach week, consciously make one accommodation that you know is important to them. This could be a habit of yours, or making room for a preference of theirs. This signals to your partner that you hear them. So try their restaurant pick, take their suggested route, adjust the thermostat to their ideal temperature. Being flexible in low-stakes moments makes it far easier to access that quality during high-stakes ones.During conflict, I'm also a big fan of asking the question: \"What am I missing that would help this make more sense?\" It's a disarming query because it shows that you're not fighting to be right, but to better understand what's going on in your partner's head.These are small gestures that might look insignificant from the outside, but over time, they create the sense of being considered, included, and influential, which are the conditions where real intimacy takes root. That is what separates the couples who merely coexist from those who continually grow closer.​Baya Voce is a relationship expert who helps couples come back together after conflict.

    "body": "The first day of sale of the iPhone 15 smartphone in Mumbai, India, on Sept. 22, 2023.Dhiraj Singh | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesApple has filed a case in the Delhi High Court against the country's antitrust body because of how it considers global turnover when calculating penalties.The iPhone maker, which is among the fastest-growing smartphone brands in India, is challenging India's new antitrust law under which the U.S. company could face fines of up to $38 billion, according to a report by Reuters.Apple added that it was \"unconstitutional, grossly disproportionate, unjust\" for the Competition Commission of India (CCI) to use turnover when calculating penalties.Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment from CNBC.The CCI has been investigating complaints from an alliance of Indian startups and Tinder-owner Match Group that accuse Apple of \"abusive conduct,\" which forces developers to pay high commissions for in-app purchases. Apple denied the charges.The CCI's final verdict is still pending, but it said its \"prima facie view [is] that mandatory use of Apple's IAP for paid apps and in-app purchases restricts the choice available to the app developers to select a payment processing system of their choice,\" in an order in December 2021.Apple recorded its highest-ever quarterly shipments in India of 5 million units in the third quarter of 2025, according to data from IDC. watch nowThe company is expected to sell about 15 million iPhones in India this year and could rank among the top five smartphone companies there, Navkendar Singh, associate vice president with IDC India,  on Nov. 18.Apple is among the global companies diversifying their manufacturing supply chains away from China to India.

    "body": "Vcg | Visual China Group | Getty ImagesWhen ChatGPT launched in 2022, Google was caught flatfooted, but the launch of Gemini 3 and the Ironwood AI chip this month has experts raving about Alphabet's AI comeback. Google kicked off November by unveiling Ironwood, the seventh generation of its tensor processing units, or TPUs, that the company says lets customers \"run and scale the largest, most data-intensive models in existence.\" And last week, Google launched Gemini 3, its latest artificial intelligence model, saying it requires \"less prompting\" and provides smarter answers than its predecessors. Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff captured the excitement around Gemini 3 with a Sunday post on X, saying that despite using OpenAI's ChatGPT daily for three years, he wasn't going back after two hours of using Gemini 3. \"The leap is insane,\" wrote Benioff, whose company has partnerships with Google, OpenAI and other frontier AI model providers. \"Everything is sharper and faster. It feels like the world just changed, again.\"Most tech stocks were down to start the week, except for one: Alphabet. Shares of the Google parent surged more than 5% on Monday, adding to last week's gain of more than 8%. Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway revealed earlier this month that it owns a $4.3 billion stake in Alphabet as of the end of the third quarter. Alphabet shares are up nearly 70% this year and have outperformed Meta's by more than 50 percentage points this year, and last week, Alphabet's market cap surpassed Microsoft's.All of this came despite Nvidia reporting stronger-than-expect revenue and guidance in its third-quarter earnings last week.\"You may be asking why almost all of the AI stocks we cover are selling off after such good news from Nvidia,\" Melius Research analyst Ben Reitzes wrote in a note Monday, referring to Nvidia's positive third quarter earnings last week. \"There is one real reason for worry and it is the 'AI comeback' of Alphabet.\" But while Google appears to have regained the edge, its lead over rivals remains razor thin in the gruelingly competitive AI market, experts said. Sundar Pichai, chief executive officer of Alphabet Inc., during the Bloomberg Tech conference in San Francisco, California, US, on Wednesday, June 4, 2025. David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesPutting the pieces togetherWith Gemini 3 and Ironwood, Google CEO Sundar Pichai appears to have finally put the pieces together for the company's AI offerings, said Michael Nathanson, co-founder of equity research firm Moffett Nathanson. Google is serving a broad range of customers from consumers to enterprise, something the company initially struggled to do after the arrival of ChatGPT. \"Three years ago, they were seen as kind of lost and there were all these hot takes saying they lost their way and Sundar is a failure,\" Nathanson said. \"Now, they have a huge leg up.\"The company had a number of AI product mishaps in its initial attempts to catch up with OpenAI. In 2024 alone, Google had to pull its image generation product Imagen 2 for several months after users discovered a number of historical inaccuracies. The launch of AI Overviews caused a similar reaction when users discovered it gave faulty advice, which the company later remedied with additional guardrails.\"There was a lot of fumbling, and they were scrambling,\" said Gil Luria, managing director at technology research firm DA Davidson. \"But they had the tech in the pantry, and it was just a matter of getting it all together and shipped.\"Of particular note is how quickly Google launched Gemini 3 after the spring release of Gemini 2.5, which was already considered an impressive model. The hyper-realistic image generation features of Nano Banana is another notch in Google's belt. After the company initially launched the image generation tool, Gemini shot to the top of the Apple App Store in September, dethroning ChatGPT. And after the launch of Gemini 3, Google released Nano Banana Pro last week. Google's ownership of YouTube and all the content on the video platform gives the company an edge when it comes to training models for image and video generation. \"The amount of video and current data that Google has, that's really a huge competitive advantage,\" said Mike Gualtieri, vice president and principal analyst for Forrester Research. \"I don't see how OpenAI and Anthropic can overcome that.\"Additionally, Google has successfully incorporated its AI models into its enterprise products, driving sales for the company's cloud unit. In its third quarter earnings results last month, Google reached its first $100 billion quarter, boosted by its cloud growth. The company's cloud unit, which houses its AI services, showed solid growth and a $155 billion backlog from customers. And it's not just the AI models. Google is also garnering attention with its AI chips. Google says Ironwood is nearly 30 times more power efficient than its first TPU from 2018. Google's ASIC chips are emerging as the company's secret weapon in the AI wars and have helped it notch recent deals worth billions with customers such as Anthropic. After a report said that Meta could strike a deal with Google to use its TPUs for the social media company's data centers, Nvidia saw its stock drop 3% on Tuesday, prompting the chipmaker to post a response on social media. With the rise of Google's TPUs, Nvidia may no longer have the AI chips market cornered.\"The advantage of having the whole stack is you can optimize your model to work specifically well on a TPU chip and you're building everything to a more optimally designed,\" said Luria.The company's ability to serve AI enterprise customers with its TPUs and Google Cloud offerings as well as its incorporation of Gemini 3 throughout its consumer products is driving Wall Street's enthusiasm.Experts who spoke with CNBC said the competitive landscape is broader than just one AI winner, but they added that it's become increasingly expensive for multiple companies to prove success.Tight competitionDespite these wins, Google is still in fierce competition with other AI companies, experts said.\"Having the state of the art model for a few days doesn't mean they've won to the extent that the stock market is implying,\" Luria said, pointing to Anthropic's new Opus 4.5 model launched Monday. Earlier this month, OpenAI also announced two updates to its GPT-5 model to make it \"warmer by default and more conversational\" as well as \"more efficient and easier to understand in everyday use,\" the company said. \"The frontier models still seem to be neck and neck in some ways,\" Forrester Research's Gualtieri said.The competitive edge will likely go to the companies willing to spend more money given the expenses of the AI race, experts said. In their earnings reports last month, Alphabet, Meta, Microsoft and Amazon each lifted their guidance for capital expenditures. They collectively expect that number to reach more than $380 billion this year.\"These companies are spending a lot of money assuming there's gonna be a winner take all when in reality we may end up with frontier models being a commodity and several will be interchangeable,\" Luria said.For Google, maintaining a lead in AI won't be without challenges. Company executives told employees earlier this month that Google has to double its serving capacity every six month to meet demand for AI services and run its frontier models, CNBC reported last week. \"The competition in AI infrastructure is the most critical and also the most expensive part of the AI race,\" Google Cloud Vice President Amin Vahdat told employees.Although Google's in-house TPUs have gotten increased attention as viable alternatives to Nvidia's Blackwell chips, Nvidia still holds more than 90% of the AI chip market. In its post on Tuesday, Nvidia pointed out that its chips are more flexible and powerful than ASIC chips, like Google's Ironwood, which are typically designed for a single company or function.And despite getting Salesforce's Benioff to switch to Gemini, Google also has a lot of catching up to do with its consumer chat product, experts said, citing hallucinations and lower user numbers than OpenAI's.The Gemini app has 650 million monthly active users and AI Overviews has 2 billion monthly users, Google said last month. OpenAI, by comparison, said in August that ChatGPT hit 700 million users per week.  \"Yes, Google has got its act together,\" Luria said. \"But that doesn't mean they've won.\"WATCH: AI narrative is shifting towards Google with its complete stack, says Plexo Capital's Lo Toneywatch now",

Headline inflation in Tokyo for October dipped slightly to 2.7% from 2.8% the month before, while core inflation came in at 2.8%, slightly higher than the 2.7% expected by economists polled by Reuters. Core inflation in Japan strips out prices of fresh food but includes energy prices. Investors will also watch India's GDP for its fiscal second quarter, ending September, later on Friday. Japan's Nikkei 225 fell 0.15% at the open, while the broad-based Topix was little changed.South Korea's Kospi was down 0.61%, and the small-cap Kosdaq up by 1.66%.Australia's S&P/ASX 200 started the day just above the flatline. Hong Kong Hang Seng index futures were at 25,935, lower than the HSI's last close of 25,945.93.Overnight in the U.S., all three major indexes were little changed. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures rose just 10 points. S&P 500 futures and Nasdaq-100 futures traded just above the flatline.Stocks are on pace for a losing month when trading resumes on Friday. A pullback in tech stocks has weighed on the major averages in November, as doubt swirled around the future profitability of AI companies.Yet some investors are hopeful that this month's slide will signal a year-end rally for the major averages, as they step in to buy stocks that have been unduly punished at more attractive valuations.U.S. markets were closed Thursday for Thanksgiving Day. The stock market will close early at 1 p.m. ET on Friday.— CNBC's Sean Conlon and Pia Singh contributed to this report. ",

    "body": "At 88 years old, renowned actor Morgan Freeman is still starring in movies and using his distinctive voice to narrate films. His acting career spans six decades, and he isn't looking to retire, according to AARP.Freeman told the nonprofit that he plans to \"keep moving.\" And he pairs that sentiment with the advice he received from his dear friend and fellow actor, Clint Eastwood.\"There is a saying about old age — 'Keep moving' — and what Clint Eastwood, 95, says: 'Don't let the old man in,'\" Freeman told AARP earlier this month.\"The way to do that is to keep getting up in the morning, keep working out in the gym, keep taking your vitamins, keep taking your prescribed meds, and keep moving. Keep moving. That is the secret to it all.\"And Freeman is doing just that. This year, he starred in the third installment of the \"Now You See Me\" movie franchise, reprising his role as Thaddeus Bradley.Common suggestions from centenarians and people over the age of 80 are to stay active and to never retire. Those tips align with the rules of ikigai, a Japanese principle that is often linked to longevity and wellness.You get the most movement out of golf at my age. It's a great sport for older adults.In his free time, much of what Freeman does aligns with his hack for longevity, which is to keep moving. A passion of his is playing golf, and he believes it's a wonderful sport to keep up with at his age.\"You get the most movement out of golf at my age, mind you,\" Freeman said. \"It's walking, stooping, bending, swinging, cussing. It's a great sport for older adults.\"As Freeman nears 90, his primary concern is if advancing in age will affect his ability to play the sport he loves. \"Will I still be playing golf? That's the question,\" he said.Another important choice that Freeman made throughout his acting career was never letting his accolades get to his head, even after he won an Oscar in 2005. That's the same advice he has for actors and actresses who aspire to achieve the same today.\"It didn't change me one whit. I kind of knew early on that I would eventually get one. It didn't change me. I hope it didn't change me,\" Freeman said. \"Because the only change you can expect after you've gotten an Oscar is maybe your price goes up a tiny bit and your job prospects go up a bit. That's the one thing or two things I guess you could look forward to.

    "body": "Carly Xie looks over facial mask items at the Face Shop, which specializes in Korean cosmetics, in San Francisco, April 15, 2015.Avila Gonzalez | San Francisco Chronicle | Hearst Newspapers | Getty ImagesOn a recent Saturday at an Ulta Beauty store in midtown Manhattan, Denise McCarthy, a mother in her 40s, stood in front of a wall of tiny pastel bottles, tubes and compacts. Her phone buzzed — another TikTok from her 15-year-old daughter.\"My kids text me the TikToks,\" she told CNBC, scooping Korean lip tints and sunscreens into her basket, destined for Christmas stockings. \"I don't even know what half of this does. I just buy the ones they send me.\"Two aisles over, a group of college students compared swatches of Korean cushion foundations. A dad asked a store associate whether a viral Korean sunscreen was the one \"from the girl who does the 'get ready with me' videos.\" Near the checkout, a display of Korean sheet mask mini-packs was nearly empty.Scenes like this are playing out across the country.Once a niche reserved for beauty obsessives, Korean cosmetics — known as K-beauty — are breaking fully into the American mainstream, fueled by TikTok virality, younger and more diverse shoppers, and aggressive expansion from retailers such as Ulta, Sephora, Walmart and Costco.K-beauty sales in the United States are expected to top $2 billion in 2025, up more than 37% from last year, according to market research firm NielsenIQ, far outpacing the broader beauty market's single-digit growth.And even as trade tensions complicate supply chains, brands and retailers told CNBC the momentum is strong.\"We have no plans of slowing down and see more opportunities to penetrate the market,\" said Janet Kim, vice president at K-beauty brand Neogen.In the first half of 2025, South Korea shipped a record $5.5 billion worth of cosmetics, up nearly 15% year over year, and has become the leading exporter of cosmetics to the U.S., surpassing France, according to data from the South Korean government.\"The growth has been remarkable,\" said Therese-Ann D'Ambrosia, vice president of beauty and personal care at NielsenIQ. \"When you compare that to the broader beauty market, which is growing at single digits, K-beauty is clearly operating in a different gear right now.\"Facial skin care remains the biggest K-beauty revenue driver in the U.S., NielsenIQ reported. Hair care is growing fastest, and hybrid items such as tinted serums and skin care-infused cushion compacts — sponge cushions soaked with an SPF foundation — continue to surge, the firm said.Big businessRetailers are racing to take advantage of the cosmetics boom, and a turf war is underway.Ulta, which has over 1,400 U.S. stores, launched \"K-beauty World\" in July, to spotlight Korean brands and tech devices. It's the only major U.S. retailer carrying products from Medicube, a beauty-tech company touted by celebrities such as Hailey Bieber. Ulta's first quarter 2025 report cited a 38% increase in Korean skin care sales, and executives said in August that new K-beauty partnerships contributed to the company beating Wall Street expectations for earnings in the second quarter. Sephora is leaning in as well. Its Times Square flagship location now features an entire wall of Korean skin care and cosmetics, and the retailer secured exclusive U.S. launches for Korean heritage brand Hanyul and sensitive-skin label Aestura.Big-box players are piling in too. Costco and Walmart have also expanded their assortments, adding essences, serums and sheet masks as demand accelerates.\"It's an arms race to see who can capitalize on the market for Korean products,\" Delphine Horvath, professor of cosmetics and fragrance marketing at the Fashion Institute of Technology, told CNBC. \"These products are now seen as a top driver of growth for cosmetic brands, and it seems it will keep booming.\"The competition is heating up just as Olive Young, often called the \"Sephora of Seoul,\" prepares to open its first U.S. store in Los Angeles next year. Asian beauty retailer Sukoshi is also expanding, planning 20 new stores in the coming year across cities such as Seattle, Miami, and Austin, Texas.\"Meeting customers where they can touch, feel and try what they see on TikTok is key,\" Sukoshi CEO Linda Dang told CNBC. \"Across the industry, companies are looking to expand partly because people really don't want to have to wait for shipping or travel all the way to Korea to get products.\"The boom arrives in the middle of the ongoing trade war.This spring, U.S. shoppers rushed to stock up on K-beauty favorites, bracing for price hikes from tariffs, Dang said. However, prices ultimately stayed relatively stable as Korean brands have temporarily absorbed the duties, Dang said, though many are now exploring alternative manufacturing or shipping methods.South Korea finalized a deal with President Donald Trump last month, settling on a 15% tariff rate instead of the initial 25% levy the president announced in April.\"The system of easy trading isn't what it was before tariffs,\" Dang told CNBC. \"That being said, a lot of companies have worked with advertisers and internally to do their best to offset and prevent passing those costs on to customers in the U.S.\"A visitor tries Korean-made cosmetics during the 2022 Korea Tourism Organization's Discover Your Korea, in Vanderbilt Hall of Grand Central Terminal, New York.Lev Radin | Pacific Press | Lightrocket | Getty ImagesThe 'second wave'Over the past decade, there's also been a rise in Korean entertainment in the U.S. — from pop groups such as BTS and Blackpink to this year's Netflix hit \"KPop Demon Hunters\" —which has helped push South Korea's cultural exports to unprecedented popularity.\"Korean culture has exploded on every front, and that has really shown up when it comes to K-beauty,\" Dang said.K-beauty's \"first wave,\" which hit the U.S. in the mid-2010s, was defined by \"glass skin,\" 10-step routines, snail mucin, cushion compacts and beauty blemish creams. Most products catered to lighter skin tones, and distribution was limited to small boutiques, Amazon sellers and early test placements at Ulta and Sephora, beauty experts said.\"The first wave had some penetration, but nothing like today,\" Horvath said. \"It was mostly people in the know.\"The second wave has been bigger, faster and far more inclusive. It has spanned color cosmetics, hair and scalp care, body care, fragrances and high-tech devices. TikTok is the central engine of discovery, especially for Gen Z and millennial shoppers, who account for roughly three-fourths of K-beauty consumers, according to a Personal Care Insights market analyst report. Posts tagged \"K-beauty\" or \"Korean skin care\" draw 250 million views per week, according to consumer data firm Spate. And viral products with sleek packaging often vanish from shelves faster than retailers can restock — particularly those that combine gentle formulas and low prices, Dang said.\"TikTok has changed the game,\" Horvath said. \"It's easier to educate consumers on innovation and get the word out. Brands are deeply invested in paying influencers, and TikTokers talk about textures, formulas and efficacy.\"Virality has also pushed brands to be more inclusive for younger and more diverse shoppers. After TikTok creators criticized Korean brand Tirtir for offering only three foundation shades, the company expanded to 40 shades within months and many other companies followed suit.The trend is visible across the Americas: 61% of consumers in Mexico and nearly half in Brazil say K-beauty is popular in their country, compared with about 45% in the U.S., according to Statista.\"Traditional retail and e-commerce remain important, but TikTok Shop is the standout disruptor,\" said Nielsen's D'Ambrosia. \"It's not just about the direct sales on that one platform; it's about how it's changing the entire discovery and purchase journey.\"But the second wave brings its own risks. A heavy dependence on virality could expose brands to sudden algorithm changes or regulatory scrutiny, D'Ambrosia said.\"When you have so much growth concentrated on one platform [such as TikTok], algorithm changes could significantly impact discoverability overnight,\" D'Ambrosia said. \"We've seen what happens when platforms tweak their recommendation engines. ... There are definitely some caution flags we're watching.\"Collagen eye patches and face masks at the Face Shop, which specializes in Korean beauty items, in San Francisco, April 15, 2015.Avila Gonzalez | San Francisco Chronicle | Hearst Newspapers | Getty ImagesRapid innovationK-beauty's staying power, Dang said, is rooted in an intensely competitive domestic Korean market. Trends move at breakneck speed and consumers spend more per capita on beauty than in any other country, according to South Korean research firm KOISRA.South Korea had more than 28,000 licensed cosmetics sellers in 2024 — nearly double that of five years ago — creating a pressure-cooker environment that forces constant experimentation, said Neogen's Kim.\"We develop about hundreds of formulas each day,\" Kim told CNBC. \"We build the library and we test results with clinical individual tests. ... Everything that's very unique and works really well for skin care, we develop.\"Korean consumers churn through trends quickly, fueling a pipeline of upstart brands that can go viral and, in some cases, get acquired. For example, when gooey snail mucin, a gel used to protect and repair people's skin, took off globally, skin care brand Amorepacific acquired COSRX, the small Korean brand that helped popularize the ingredient, for roughly $700 million.The next wave of products, analysts predict, are likely to be even more experimental. Brands are betting on buzzy ingredients such as DNA extracted from salmon or trout sperm that early research suggests may help calm or repair skin. They are also expanding into biotechnology.\"K-beauty is very data-driven. [Artificial intelligence] helps us get fast results for content, formula development, and advertising,\" Kim said. \"In Korea, they started talking about delivery systems. They're very good with biotechnology.\"watch now",

    "body": "Actors Chris Tucker and Jackie Chan arrive to the premiere of \"Rush Hour 3\" at Mann's Chinese Theater on July 30, 2007 in Hollywood, California. Jeff Vespa | WireImage | Getty ImagesA push from President Donald Trump led Paramount Skydance to revive its \"Rush Hour\" buddy cop movie series, two decades after the last installment, according to multiple reports Tuesday.Paramount has secured funding for \"Rush Hour 4\" and struck a distribution arrangement with Warner Bros. Discovery, which previously owned the franchise under its New Line banner, Puck's Matthew Belloni reported. The project had been in limbo for years.Studios were repeatedly approached about a new installment, but had balked at working with director Brett Ratner.Ratner's career collapsed in 2017 after several female actors accused him of sexual misconduct. He has denied the allegations and was never charged.Belloni reported that Paramount's decision to release \"Rush Hour 4\" came \"after prodding from Trump on behalf of Brett Ratner,\" who will direct the film.Ratner, in late 2024, was tapped to direct a documentary about first lady Melania Trump for Amazon Prime, which reportedly paid $40 million for the rights to make it.In the \"Rush Hour 4\" deal, Paramount will collect a flat distribution fee to release the film in theaters, Variety first reported. Warner Bros. will take an undisclosed share of box-office receipts before financiers recoup costs.Paramount Skydance and Warner Bros. did not respond to requests for comment. The White House also did not respond to a request for comment.The first three \"Rush Hour\" films were global hits, particularly in China, earning more than $850 million worldwide, according to box office estimates. They also turned Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker into major stars.But the new sequel faces a changed theatrical landscape where comedies have struggled at the box office.And at 71 years old, Chan has scaled back U.S. studio work, while Tucker has not headlined a major film since 2007.Both Chan and Tucker are expected to be in the new film.Trump's intervention in Hollywood has drawn criticism. He has informally tapped allies including Sylvester Stallone, Jon Voight, and Mel Gibson as cultural emissaries, and has repeatedly said he wants to restore what he calls \"classical masculinity\" to studio filmmaking.For Paramount, the \"Rush Hour\" revival comes as the newly combined studio aims to nearly double its output, targeting 15 films in 2026 and up to 18 by 2028.The timing also overlaps with a major industry shake-up: Paramount Skydance, Comcast, and Netflix have all submitted first-round bids to acquire Warner Bros. The company's portfolio includes some of entertainment's most valuable franchises, from DC to Harry Potter.Paramount is bidding for all of Warner Bros. Its proposal, previously valued at about $23.50 per share, would bring the entire company — the studio, HBO Max, and the cable networks — under one owner.Comcast is reportedly interested in the studio and streaming assets, including Warner Bros. and HBO Max. The deal would fold those pieces into NBCUniversal and let Warner Bros. Discovery spin off CNN and TNT Sports before the deal closes. Netflix is also interested in the film and streaming assets, people familiar with the matter previously told CNBC.Warner Bros. Discovery aims to have its sale process wrapped by mid- to late-December, CNBC previously reported.Disclosure: Comcast is the parent company of NBCUniversal, which owns CNBC. Versant would become the new parent company of CNBC upon Comcast's planned spinoff of Versant.",

The fire is Hong Kong's deadliest since 1948, when a warehouse blaze killed 176 people.The latest blaze tore through Wang Fuk Court, an eight-tower public housing complex in northern Hong Kong, home to 4,600 people in 2,000 apartments, according to Reuters.On Thursday morning, Reuters reported, citing authorities, that the fire in four of the seven affected blocks had been brought under control nearly a full day after the fire began. Firefighters were still working to contain the blaze in the remaining areas.Officials said the blaze may have started on a section of bamboo scaffolding encasing the complex, then spread to other buildings through the wooden poles and protective netting — prompting public scrutiny of the city's housing standards.  Hong Kong's police pointed to a \"grossly negligent\" construction company for using \"highly inflammable\" foam material, protective mesh sheets and plastic that may not have met fire standards.

    "body": "QINGDAO, CHINA - FEBRUARY 05 2025: Workers assemble cars at a car plant of SAIC-GM-Wuling in Qingdao city in east China's Shandong province Wednesday, Feb. 05, 2025. ZHANG JINGANG | Future Publishing | Getty Images Chinese industrial firms saw their earnings take a hit in October as trade tensions with the U.S. flared that month while broader growth momentum in the economy faltered. Industrial profits dropped 5.5% from a year earlier in October, the biggest decline since June, the National Bureau of Statistics data showed, reversing the double-digit growth seen in August and September. For the first ten months of the year, profits at major industrial firms grew 1.9% from a year ago, the official data showed, decelerating from a 3.2% rise in the January to September period.   Trade tensions between China and the U.S. had escalated that month over export controls, with U.S. President Donald Trump threatening additional 100% tariffs on imports from China, before the two economic superpowers reached a deal in South Korea at the month's end. The mining sector saw profits plunge 27.8% in the January to October period, while profits for the manufacturing and utilities sectors, comprising suppliers for electricity, heat, fuel and water, rose 7.7% and 9.5% respectively.    Profits for carmakers gained 4.4% in the first ten months of the year, compared to a 3.4% climb in the first nine months. Profits at state-owned enterprises were flat, compared with gains of 3.5% for industrial firms with foreign investment, including those with investment from Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan, and 1.9% for private companies. Yu Weining, chief statistician at NBS, attributed the drop in October to high-base effects from last year and rapid expansion in corporate spending. China's manufacturing activity contracted more than expected in October, with the official manufacturing purchasing managers' index slumping to a six-month low of 49.0. A reading above the 50 benchmark indicates growth, while one below that suggests contraction.Tepid consumer demandwatch nowChina's consumer prices unexpectedly returned to growth in October, rising 0.2% from a year ago, after staying in negative territory for most of the year. Core inflation, stripping out food and energy prices, jumped 1.2%, the highest since February 2024. The reality, however, was less rosy than the core inflation reading suggested, according to Ting Lu, chief China economist at Nomura Bank, who estimated that about a quarter of the 1.2% core inflation readings had \"almost nothing to do with local consumption\" but were mainly caused by surging gold prices.  The \"underestimated decline of rents also contributed to the overstatement of headline inflation data,\" Lu said, suggesting that the country has been mired in a \"moderate recession\" since late 2022.    \"It will take more time for China to truly escape the deflationary conundrum it currently faces, especially as economic growth has stumbled since mid-2025,\" Lu added. Growth faltersThe economy has slowed significantly, expanding just 4.8% in the third quarter, and recent indicators suggest it has lost further momentum at the start of the fourth quarter.  Retail sales grew 2.9% in October, slowing for a fifth straight month and marking the weakest growth in over a year. Fixed-asset investment shrank 1.7% for the first ten months of the year, unseen since 2020 during the pandemic. Industrial output also expanded by a smaller-than-expected 4.9%. Meanwhile, the urban unemployment rate remained elevated at 5.1% in October. Chinese policymakers have signaled a shift towards boosting consumption over the next five years, but have yet to roll out new meaningful stimulus. Economists widely expect Beijing to hold off large-scale stimulus as the economy is on track to hit its growth target of \"around 5%\" this year. \"Policymakers don't want to miss or over-achieve the target,\" said Larry Hu, chief China economist at Macquarie Group, expecting China's economy may continue to grow 5% in 2026 on robust export growth.  That said, \"deflationary pressure\" will likely continue to weigh on the economy as strong external demand reduces the urgency for domestic stimulus, Hu added. \n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tWeekly analysis and insights from Asia's largest economy in your inbox\n\t\t\tSubscribe now\n\t\t\n\t",

    "body": "Drug pricing has emerged as a key topic to watch for pharmaceutical companies and investors in 2025. As President Donald Trump pushes for lower medicine prices for Americans, the sector is facing additional pricing pressure from a Biden-era law called the Inflation Reduction Act.The IRA, voted into law in 2022, allows the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) to negotiate prices for a number of drugs each year for patients in Medicare, the federal health insurance program for seniors. It's now making waves also across the Atlantic. While these changes are taking place firmly in the U.S., pharmaceutical companies across the globe are finding themselves increasingly exposed to the American market. A number of European companies have announced sizeable U.S. investments to placate Trump and his aggressive tariff agenda, while AstraZeneca is moving toward another direct listing on the NYSE to tap into the deeper pockets of U.S. capital markets. Meanwhile, Novo Nordisk has cited a failure to deal with changes in the U.S. market as part of the reason for recent leadership changes.Late Tuesday, the CMS announced newly negotiated prices for 15 blockbuster drugs from 2027, including Novo Nordisk's mega bestseller Ozempic which will see a 71% discount to its list price.Among other European pharma giants, AstraZeneca's cancer drug Calquence will face a 40% discount, while GSK's lung disease medicines Trelegy and Breo with 73% and 83% discount, respectively. Overall, discounts ranged between 38% and 85%, with estimated savings of about $8.5 billion, 36% lower than recent annual spending.watch now\"Whether through the Inflation Reduction Act or President Trump's Most Favored Nation policy, this is what serious, fair, and disciplined negotiation looks like,\" said CMS Deputy Administrator Chris Klomp in a statement. A GSK spokesperson said they were pleased with the agreement. \"We strongly believe in the value of both Trelegy and Breo and remain committed to working with CMS.\"Novo, on the other hand, was critical. \"We continue to have serious concerns about the Inflation Reduction Act's impact on patients and remain opposed to government price setting,\" a spokesperson told CNBC in emailed comments. \"We have seen that government price setting has not translated to lower out-of-pocket costs for patients and can lead to a loss of coverage for medications and higher insurance premiums,\" they added.A key marketThe U.S. is a key market for most large-cap pharma companies, mostly due to the significantly higher prices for branded medicines. In the first nine months of 2025, 56% of Novo's total sales originated in the U.S. Meanwhile, AstraZeneca logged 42% of product sales in the U.S. and GSK some 52%, over the same period.Prescription drug prices are about three times higher in the U.S. compared to other wealthy countries, a 2024 report by RAND found.\"The [IRA price] cuts were a little higher than last year, which I think people were expecting,\" Barclays analyst Emily Field told CNBC. \"It doesn't seem like there was any surprises at all,\" she added. Muted shares also indicated that the outcome of the negotiations was largely expected. AstraZeneca and GSK rose less than 1% each in afternoon trading. Novo shares however, ended the day 4.7% higher. Semaglutide, sold as Ozempic for diabetes and Wegovy for weight loss, will from 2027 be priced at $274 for Medicare patients, down from a previous list price of $959. That said, Medicare plans already get large discounts on companies' list prices, but those rates aren't typically disclosed. CMS is due to publish its list of 15 drugs selected for negotiations for 2028 by February 1, 2026.A Trump priorityThe IRA price negotiations are, however, not the main concern for companies, Field said, noting how it's becoming a better-understood and predictable process. \"What people are much more worried about is further directions that MFN could go… if they decide to do something different,\" she said. Trump has made it a priority to rein in U.S. drug costs and in May, signed an executive order to implement so-called Most Favored Nation pricing, meaning U.S. prices would be tied to lower ones paid abroad. Lower prices in the U.S. could have a dramatic effect on companies' top and bottom lines, but companies are finding ways to mitigate the impact by making deals with the Trump administration to voluntarily lower certain prices, as well as pledge investments in U.S. manufacturing to avoid tariffs. Stock Chart IconStock chart iconNovo, AstraZeneca and GSK shares year to date.Earlier this month, Trump announced deals with Novo and rival Eli Lilly to slash prices of weight loss drugs for Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries in 2026, as well as offering them directly to consumers at a discount through the TrumpRx.gov website. Under the agreement, starting doses of Novo's Wegovy and Lilly's Zepbound will be $350 per month and trend down to $245 per month over a two years.While reduced pricing will hit sales, volume gains from opening up broad access for obesity drugs could offset that headwind, BMO analysts noted. Last week, Novo also announced it is lowering prices of Ozempic and Wegovy to $349 per month from $499 for patients paying out-of-pocket, following pressure from Trump. Other companies including AstraZeneca and U.S.-based Pfizer have also announced deals with the Trump administration to cut drug prices. ",

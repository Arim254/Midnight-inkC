    "body": "US Federal Reserve Board Chairman Jerome Powell speaks during a news conference following a Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting in Washington, DC, on Dec. 10, 2025.Saul Loeb | AFP | Getty ImagesFederal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell on Wednesday explained his controversial decision to attend Fed Governor Lisa Cook's Supreme Court hearing, saying the case could have a major effect on the central bank's independence.\"That case is perhaps the most important legal case in the Fed's 113-year history,\" Powell said Wednesday during his post-Fed meeting press conference. \"As I thought about it, I thought it might be hard to explain why I didn't attend.\"Powell last week attended oral arguments n the case, which will determine if President Donald Trump can fire Cook, who had been accused of mortgage fraud, a claim she denies. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent called Powell's decision to attend a \"mistake\" in an interview with CNBC last week, saying the Fed chair was politicizing the case.Powell also noted that former Fed Chair Paul Volcker \"famously\" went to a Supreme Court case in the 1980s, but did not specific which. That showed Powell there was precedent for his attendance, he said.The Federal Reserve was created in 1913 under President Woodrow Wilson.During the hearing, Supreme Court justices appeared skeptical of Trump's claims that he was within his powers to attempt to remove Cook and raised concern about what such a precedent would mean for Fed independence.Trump has cited mortgage fraud allegations in his move to axe Cook, but critics have said the action appears tied to his push for lower interest rates. The Supreme Court previously allowed Cook to remain in her role pending the oral arguments.Powell's attendance followed his revelation earlier this month that he's facing a federal probe over the Fed's headquarters renovations. Politicians and monetary policy watchers have connected the investigation to Trump's repeated criticism of Powell for not moving interest rates lower at a faster pace.watch nowThe criminal investigation of Powell and attempted removal of Cook have together raised concerns that the Fed's longstanding apolitical posture is at risk. Powell said the Fed's political separation is key to ensuring credibility long term during Wednesday's press conference.\"The point of independence is not to protect policymakers or anything like that,\" Powell said. \"It just is that every advanced economy (and) democracy in the world has come around to this common practice.\"If you lose that separation, he said, \"it would be hard to restore the credibility of the institution.\"Looming over Wednesday's press conference was the knowledge that Trump could at any time announce a successor for Powell, who's term as chair ends in May. Powell offered some advice timely advice for whoever takes the role next.\"Don't get pulled into elected politics,\" Powell said. \"Don't do it. \"",

Here's how the company performed versus LSEG estimates:Earnings per share: 92 cents adjusted vs. 88 cents expectedRevenue: $3.57 billion vs. $3.53 billion expected. Revenues grew 20.5% from $2.96 billion in the year-ago period.

The board also approved additional $5 billion for share buybacks. ServiceNow is forecasting subscription revenues between $3.65 billion and $3.66 billion in the first quarter and $15.53 billion and $15.57 billion for the 2026 fiscal year. The enterprise software company said its acquisition of artificial intelligence company Moveworks will contribute 100 basis points to full-year and first-quarter subscription revenue growth and first-quarter current remaining performance obligations growth, which accounts for backlog.Read more CNBC tech newsMeta shares jump on stronger-than-expected revenue forecastTesla tops estimates for quarter, but wraps up first annual revenue drop on recordIBM stock jumps on earnings beatServiceNow posts better-than-expected fourth-quarter resultsThe company is in the middle of a major spending spree to boost its AI and security capabilities as it positions itself as an \"AI control tower\" for businesses. That deal blitz has raised some concerns over whether the company is looking to acquire to reinvigorate growth, especially as fears mount that the software sector is losing ground to AI. \"Our acquisitions are 100% not a pivot away from organic growth,\" Mastantuono said. \"They represent an acceleration of it.\" She said the company is acquiring to gain key capabilities that unlock value. Last month, ServiceNow said it would buy cybersecurity startup Armis for $7.75 billion to bolster its cybersecurity offering and identity security platform Veza, and closed its nearly $3 billion Moveworks deal.

The stock popped as much as 10% in after-hours trading.Here's how the company did, compared with estimates from analysts polled by LSEG:Earnings per share: $8.88 vs. $8.23 estimatedRevenue: $59.89 billion vs. $58.59 billion estimatedMeta said it expects first-quarter sales to come in the range of $53.5 billion to $56.5 billion, ahead of analyst estimates of $51.41 billion.Finance chief Susan Li said that forecast was \"really underpinned by the strong demand that we saw through the end of Q4 and continuing into the start of 2026.\"The company said fourth-quarter sales rose 24% year-over-year. The company said its advertising business generated revenue of $58.1 billion for the period. Advertising made up nearly 97% of the company's overall revenue for the quarter. Meta said that fourth-quarter daily active people came in at 3.58 billion, in line with Wall Street estimates.The social media giant said it expects the total expenses for 2026 to come in between $162 billion through $169 billion.Capital expenditures related to the company's artificial intelligence push are expected to be in the range of $115 billion to $135 billion for 2026, ahead of analyst expectations of $110.7 billion for the year. It's also nearly double how much Meta spent on CapEx in 2025, which came in at $72.2 billion, the company said on Wednesday. Meta said the CapEx spending is due to \"year-over-year growth driven by increased investment to support our Meta Superintelligence Labs efforts and core business.\"CEO Mark Zuckerberg said Meta will release its latest AI models \"over the coming months.\"\"I expect our first models will be good, but more importantly, we'll show the rapid trajectory that we're on,\" he told analysts on a call Wednesday, \"And then, I expect us to steadily push the frontier over the course of the year, as we continue to release new models.\"The company spent a large chunk of 2025 overhauling it AI unit, investing $14.3 billion in Scale AI as part of an effort to land the startup's founder Alexandr Wang and several of his colleagues.Wang oversees Meta's top-tier TBD unit that is tasked with developing powerful AI models. The company set up TBD after its Llama 4 model launched to tepid response from developers last spring. Meta has been testing a new frontier model and Llama successor code-named Avocado, and plans to release it during the first half of the year, CNBC reported.The company's Reality Labs unit logged an operating loss of $6.02 billion while generating $955 million in sales for the quarter. Analysts were projecting Reality Labs to record an operating loss of $5.67 billion on $940.8 million in fourth-quarter sales.Reality Labs now has nearly $80 billion in total operating losses since late 2020.Earlier this month, Meta laid off more than 1,000 Reality Labs employees who worked on VR-related initiatives, including internal studios, as part of a shifting of resources to AI and related wearable devices, like the Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses. Although Meta tech chief Andrew Bosworth told media outlets last week that Meta is not halting its VR efforts, the company's outsized impact on that industry has chilled some developers and sparked fears of a VR winter, CNBC reported.Meta on Wednesday said that it expects Reality Labs operating losses in 2026 to remain at similar levels to the year prior. Zuckerberg said he expects this year to be the peak of Reality labs' losses, \"as we start to gradually reduce our losses going forward.\"The company noted that regulatory and legal headwinds in the European Union and the U.S. respectively could \"significantly impact our business and financial results.\" Meta said that various high-profile social media trials commencing this year \"may ultimately result in a material loss.\"This is breaking news.

    "body": "Tesla CEO Elon Musk attends the Saudi-U.S. Investment Forum, in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, May 13, 2025. Hamad I Mohammed | ReutersTesla reported better-than-expected fourth-quarter results after the bell on Wednesday, but revenue for the year dropped 3%, the first time on record the company has recorded an annual decline. The stock rose 2% in extended trading. Here's how the company did, compared with estimates from analysts polled by LSEG:Earnings per share: 50 cents adjusted vs. 45 cents estimatedRevenue: $24.90 billion vs. $24.79 billion estimatedAuto sales have been sluggish in recent quarters for Tesla, as the company faces an onslaught of competition in various parts of the world, most notably from BYD in China.Revenue in the fourth quarter slid 3% from $25.7 billion a year earlier, with the auto segment falling 11% to $17.7 billion from $19.8 billion. Full-year revenue fell to $94.8 billion from $97.7 billion in 2024, the company said in an earnings release. The decline was caused, in part, by a \"decrease in vehicle deliveries\" and \"lower regulatory credit revenue,\" Tesla said.Earlier this month, Tesla reported a 16% plunge in vehicle deliveries for the fourth quarter and 8.6% decline for the full year. Deliveries are the closest approximation of sales reported by Tesla, but are not precisely defined in the company's shareholder communications.Some of Tesla's 2025 problems were related to CEO Elon Musk's work with President Donald Trump, as well as his incendiary political rhetoric and endorsements of far-right figures in Europe. That sparked a consumer backlash, which persisted through the year.Part of the decline also related to Tesla's aging lineup. In the company's earnings call on Wednesday, Musk said Tesla would put an end to production of its Model S and X vehicles, which were first sold in 2012 and 2015, respectively. While Tesla's core autos business has been struggling, Musk has tried to focus investor attention elsewhere. In particular, he's touted the company's nascent Robotaxi business and its Optimus humanoid robots, which have yet to hit the market.Tesla plans to convert the factory lines where it had produced the Model S and X in Fremont, California, to lines that will make the forthcoming Optimus humanoid robots, Musk said.\"We're really moving into a future that is based on autonomy,\" Musk said, bracing investors for a high level of capital expenditures. Tesla CFO Vaibhav Taneja said investors should expect some $20 billion in capex this year, with investments in new factories, Optimus and artificial intelligence computing resources. In 2025, Tesla launched a Robotaxi-branded ride-hailing app, and has been running a pilot service in Austin, Texas. Last week, Tesla executives said they had taken human safety supervisors out of a handful of cars in the Austin fleet to conduct driverless passenger rides.The company said in its investor deck that it plans to have coverage in seven additional U.S. markets in the first half of this year. Those cities are Dallas, Houston, Phoenix, Miami, Orlando, Tampa and Las Vegas. Tesla said that it has begun \"tooling\" in advance of production of its forthcoming Cybercab, which is a two-seat, \"purpose-built\" driverless car that will not include a steering wheel or pedals.As for robots, Tesla said it plans to unveil the third generation of Optimus this quarter. \"The Gen 3 is our first design meant for mass production,\" the company said. Tesla is developing Optimus with the aim of someday selling it as a bipedal, intelligent robot capable of everything from factory work to babysitting.Net income in the quarter plunged 61% to $840 million, or 24 cents per share, from $2.1 billion, or 60 cents per share, a year earlier, as operating expenses jumped 39%. Tesla said in its deck that some of the increase in costs was \"driven by AI and other R&D projects.\"Revenue in the energy generation and storage business increased 25% to $3.84 billion from $3.06 billion a year ago. In the services and other segment, revenue rose 18% to $3.37 billion from $2.85 billion. Tesla said that on Jan. 16, it entered into an agreement to invest about $2 billion in Musk's AI startup, xAI, \"as part of their recent publicly-disclosed financing round.\" Earlier this month, the OpenAI competitor said it raised $20 billion, exceeding its prior target of $15 billion, with Nvidia and Cisco participating in the round. The xAI investment, along with a partnership with the company, is \"intended to enhance Tesla's ability to develop and deploy AI products and services into the physical world at scale,\" Tesla said.WATCH: Robotaxi will be major focus of Tesla's earnings call watch now",

Harun Ozalp | Anadolu | Getty ImagesMicrosoft shares fell 7% in extended trading on Wednesday after the software maker posted slowing cloud growth.Here's how the company performed in comparison with LSEG consensus:Earnings per share: $4.14 adjusted vs. $3.97 expectedRevenue: $81.27 billion vs. $80.27 billion expectedWith respect to guidance, Microsoft called for $80.65 billion to $81.75 billion in fiscal third-quarter revenue. The middle of the range was $81.2 billion, meeting the LSEG consensus of $81.19 billion. The company's forecast for quarterly Azure cloud growth was 37% to 38% at constant currency. The StreetAccount consensus was 37.1%.The company's implied fiscal third-quarter operating margin is 45.1%, below StreetAccount's 45.5% consensus. Operating expenses will include investments in artificial intelligence computing capacity and talent.For the fiscal second quarter, which ended on Dec. 31, Microsoft's revenue grew 16.7% year over year, according to a statement. Net income, at $38.46 billion, or $5.16 per share, was up from $24.11 billion, or $3.23 per share, in the same quarter a year earlier. Adjusted earnings exclude impact from investments in OpenAI. The company's gross margin was the narrowest it's been in three years, coming in just over 68%. Revenue from Azure and other cloud services grew 39%, compared with 40% growth in the fiscal first quarter. Analysts surveyed by StreetAccount and CNBC had expected 39.4% and 38.9% growth, respectively.The company reported $9.97 billion in other income, compared with other expense of $2.29 billion in the same quarter a year ago. The swing comes three months after OpenAI announced a restructuring that involved its for-profit arm becoming a public-benefit corporation. Microsoft saw a decrease in its proportionate ownership of OpenAI, yielding a dilution gain.At year end, the company's commercial remaining performance obligation, a measurement of unearned revenue and amounts that will be recognized as revenue later, stood at $625 billion, up some 110%. That's thanks to OpenAI's $250 billion cloud commitment with Microsoft during the quarter. Microsoft said 45% of commercial remaining performance obligation is tied to OpenAI, with the remainder growing 28%.\"The backlog is really good, but the disclosure that OpenAI is 45% of their backlog, it goes back to the situation where, Can OpenAI achieve these financial goals to pay Oracle, Microsoft and many of the providers,\" Jefferies analyst Brent Thill said on CNBC's Closing Bell Overtime.Thill brought up the OpenAI revenue concentration on a conference call with analysts.The rest of the commercial remaining performance obligation is \"larger than most peers, more diversified than most peers, and frankly, I think we have super high confidence in it,\" said Amy Hood, Microsoft's finance chief. She said Microsoft remains OpenAI's \"provider of scale.\"Commercial bookings growth, which tracks quarterly activity, surged to 230% from 112% in the fiscal first quarter.Microsoft's Intelligent Cloud segment that includes Azure cloud infrastructure produced $32.91 billion in revenue, up nearly 29% and more than the $32.40 billion consensus among analysts surveyed by StreetAccount.The Productivity and Business Processing segment delivered $34.12 billion in revenue, which was up about 16% and higher than StreetAccount's $33.48 billion consensus. The unit contains Office productivity software, Dynamics business management software and LinkedIn.Microsoft now has 15 million seats for its Microsoft 365 Copilot add-on for commercial productivity software subscriptions. Investors have been paying attention to the adoption of Microsoft 365 Copilot as a way to increase revenue from each user. Until this point, Microsoft had not talked about the number of people who have access.Copilot has room to grow. Microsoft now has over 450 million paid commercial Microsoft 365 seats.The More Personal Computing segment, featuring Windows, Xbox, Surface and Bing, contributed $14.25 billion in revenue. That was down about 3% and below the $14.38 billion StreetAccount consensus. Technology industry researcher Gartner said PC shipments rose 9.3% in the quarter, with support for the Windows 10 operating system ending in October. Gaming revenue declined 9.5%. Microsoft said it took an unspecified impairment charge in that division during the quarter. Former Microsoft Xbox executive Mike Ybarra described the gaming unit's strategy as \"confusing\" in an X post that he posted and later deleted in October.

Microsoft also pays for capacity from CoreWeave and Nebius in the form of leases.Microsoft's capital expenditures and finance leases in the quarter came to $37.5 billion, up 66%. Analysts polled by Visible Alpha had expected $34.31 billion.\"All up, we added nearly one gigawatt of total capacity this quarter alone,\" Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said on the call.The company's customer demand continues to outstrip supply, Hood said.\"Therefore, we must balance the need to have our incoming supply better meet growing Azure demand with expanding first-party AI usage across services like M365 Copilot and GitHub Copilot, increasing allocations to R&D teams to accelerate product innovation and continued replacement of end-of-life server and networking equipment,\" she said.During the quarter, Microsoft said it will raise the prices of commercial Office productivity software subscriptions, and Anthropic announced plans to buy $30 billion in cloud services and contract up to a gigawatt of additional computing capacity from Microsoft.In the past three months, Microsoft stock has fallen about 11%, while the S&P 500 index has gained 1%, with investors pondering the risk of generative AI models hurting the growth prospects for traditional software.WATCH: Trade Tracker: Stephanie Link sells Microsoftwatch now",

It has attracted commitments from a growing list of wealthy individuals, from billionaires such as Michael and Susan Dell and Ray Dalio to rap artist Nicki Minaj. \"JPMorgan Chase has demonstrated a long-term commitment to the financial health and well-being of all of our employees and their families around the world, including more than 190,000 here in the United States,\" CEO Jamie Dimon said in a release. \"By matching this contribution, we're making it easier for them to start saving early, invest wisely, and plan for their family's financial future.\"In a memo sent to employees Wednesday first reported by Reuters, Bank of America said it applauded the government's \"innovative solutions\" for employee savings. Wells Fargo sent its own internal memo later that same day, a copy of which was shared with CNBC. Financial firms dominate the list of companies that are matching contributions for the new accounts. Besides JPMorgan and Bank of America, the two largest U.S. banks by assets, BlackRock, BNY, Robinhood, SoFi and Charles Schwab have made similar announcements.watch now",

    "body": "U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell speaks during a press conference following a two-day meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) on interest rate policy, in Washington, D.C., U.S., Jan. 28, 2026. Jonathan Ernst | ReutersThe Federal Reserve wrapped up a two-day policy meeting Wednesday, delivering pretty much what the market expected and no major surprises from Chair Jerome Powell's news conference. Here are five things worth remembering:The decision: To no one's surprise, the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee held its benchmark funds rate in a range between 3.5%-3.75%. The move broke a string of three straight cuts and could be a harbinger of a central bank not of a mind to ease again anytime soon.The dissents: As has been the custom for the past six months or so, multiple committee members broke ranks. This time, Governors Stephen Miran and Christopher Waller wanted another quarter percentage point cut. For Miran, though, it represented a bit of a turn as he deviated from three prior dissents in favor of half-point reductions.Powell's post-meeting news conference was, in a word, a snoozer. On five separate occasions, the chair delivered variations on \"I have nothing for you on that\" to questions from reporters looking to bait him into commenting on the multiple political kerfuffles surrounding the Fed. Asked for the advice he would give his successor, Powell responded,  \"Stay out of elected politics.\"From an economic standpoint, the FOMC statement and Powell's commentary reflected expectations for solid growth, a near-term tariff-fueled boost for inflation that ultimately will recede, and a labor market in stasis as the labor force participation rate plus less immigration keep hiring in check while layoffs are also muted.And the markets yawned. With little to go on, the major stock averages closed little changed. Traders are still pricing in about a 60% chance of two additional, quarter percentage point rate cuts this year. What they're saying\"The Fed delivered a rate cut, but it arrived in a somewhat hawkish package. The Fed hasn't shut the door on further cuts, but Chair Powell has raised the bar for further action. We expect the economy to grow at a solid pace next year, but it must be accompanied by job gains. The next round of jobs data may point to the exact opposite.\" — Ellen Zentner, chief economic strategist for Morgan Stanley Wealth Management.\"It's détente at the Fed for now. But a shakeup is coming with the new Fed Chair in May.\" — Heather Long, chief economist at Navy Federal Credit Union.\"Perspectively speaking, we saw this meeting as an affirmation from the Fed of what investors were already thinking. Labor conditions are not worsening, growth has accelerated and inflation has steadied for now. To put it in other words, policy rates are much closer to neutral against the current backdrop and it's time for a long pause.\" — Charlie Ripley, senior investment strategist for Allianz Investment Management.watch now",

    "body": "A Southwest Airlines aircraft parks at Gate B33 while its tail sticks into the sunlight at Boston Logan International Airport in Boston, MA, on December 22, 2025. Austin DeSisto | Nurphoto | Getty ImagesSouthwest Airlines on Wednesday forecast a surge in 2026 profits well above analysts' expectations as the carrier overhauls its half-century-old business model to include new moneymakers like bag fees and seat assignments.The airline expects to earn at minimum, an adjusted $4 a share this year, exceeding the $3.19 analysts had anticipated, according to estimates from LSEG. It also forecast capacity growth of 2% to 3% compared with 2025, which could almost double last year's capacity expansion.\"We wanted to give a little more time before we gave the upper bound of this forecast just to let a little more information come in\" about the new initiatives, CFO Tom Doxey said in an interview Wednesday. He said travel demand has been strong.Southwest stock rose more than 5% in post-market trading after the company's report.In the first quarter, Southwest said it expects revenue per seat mile to rise 9.5%, above the 8.5% analysts expected. The carrier forecast adjusted earnings of 45 cents for the first quarter, above the 33 cents Wall Street projected.\"Notwithstanding the impact of Winter Storm Fern, 2026 is off to a strong start, driven by the Company's Customer-focused product offering, operational excellence, and dramatic progress from the transformational initiatives implemented last year,\" CEO Bob Jordan said in an earnings release. The sprawling winter storm forced airlines to cancel thousands of flights, though Southwest's Texas rival American Airlines has especially struggled to recover from the weather impacts.Here's how the company performed in fourth quarter compared with Wall Street expectations, according to consensus estimates from LSEG:Earnings per share: 58 cents adjusted vs. 58 cents cents expectedRevenue: $7.44 billion vs. $7.51 billion expectedSouthwest has spent much of the past two years making drastic changes to its business model, including ending its open boarding policy and this week moving to assigned seats, which come with upcharges for certain spots, including its new extra legroom section.watch nowLast year, the airline began charging customers to check bags for the first time ever and launched basic economy fares. The policies make the longtime industry standout more like its rivals as the airline faces pressure to improve profits.\"We're not done,\" Doxey said Wednesday about the airline's initiatives. The carriers' executives have previously discussed the possibiliyt of other ventures. Jordan said in an interview last month that Southwest is exploring airport lounges.Southwest's executives are set to face questions from investors in a call on Thursday morning about the cost of the storm, new revenue streams and growth in profits in the coming years, beyond the sales spike from their debut.Southwest's fourth-quarter net income rose almost 24% from a year earlier to $323 million, while revenue rose 7.4% to $7.44 billion. Adjusting for one-time items including a reorganization, Southwest posted earnings of $301 million or 58 cents a share, down from $356 million or 56 cents a share a year earlier.Read more CNBC airline newsBoeing outsold Airbus last year for first time since 2018, deliveries rise to 600Allegiant to buy rival budget airline Sun Country in $1.5 billion cash and stock dealWhy airline class wars will intensify in 2026American Airlines no longer lets basic economy flyers earn miles",

    "body": "U.S. Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., is followed by reporters as he walks to the Senate Chambers in the U.S. Capitol in Washington, Jan. 27, 2026.Anna Moneymaker | Getty ImagesRepublican senators appear to be opening the door to preventing a partial government shutdown as the chamber prepares to start voting on a House-passed package to fully fund a group of federal agencies through the remaining fiscal year. The Senate is set to vote on six funding bills as early as Thursday morning. If the chamber doesn't pass all of them, much of the federal government would shut down Friday at 12:01 ET.The bills would fund the Department of Homeland Security and several other agencies, including the Treasury and Defense departments. While the package once looked certain to clear the Senate and avoid a shutdown, the killing of U.S. citizen Alex Pretti by federal immigration agents Saturday in Minneapolis derailed it. Democrats are demanding that the DHS portion of the bill be stripped from the package and weighed separately to make changes to how the agency operates, a move that Republicans have so far resisted. On Wednesday, some Senate Republicans began to embrace the idea of splitting off DHS, as a shutdown looms just months after a record 43-day closure last year. The measure will require 60 votes to clear the Senate filibuster. Republicans hold only 53 seats in the upper chamber, meaning Democrats can block it if they withhold their votes.\"Rather than scuttling the whole package, I say let's go and pass what we can,\" Sen. John Kennedy, R-La., said in an interview with reporters at the Capitol on Wednesday. \"I think all the bills will pass except Homeland Security, and then we can sit down and talk about Homeland Security,\" said Kennedy, who sits on the Senate Appropriations Committee. Asked how many of his Republican colleagues support such a move, Kennedy said: \"A bunch.\"Indeed, numerous Republicans said Wednesday that while they would like to see the entire package pass the Senate, splitting off DHS is a palatable off-ramp. \"We are going to see what happens when that vote comes up,\" said Sen. John Hoeven, R-N.D., another member of the appropriations committee. \"[But] if the Democrats block it, [Senate Minority Leader Chuck] Schumer has already said that he's willing to move the five, and so I certainly have an open mind on that.\"Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., told CNBC that if Democrats are \"okay with five of the six bills,\" then \"we ought to figure out a way to get those done.\"Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., said in a press conference Wednesday that such proposals are so far \"hypotheticals\" and that he would \"reserve optionality.\" \"I think the best path forward, as I've said, is to keep the package intact,\" Thune said. \"If there are things that the Democrats want that the administration can agree with them about, then let's do that.\"Democrats are warning that a separate negotiation with the administration would not be enough to assuage their concerns. President Donald Trump has attempted a turnabout in recent days after the fallout from the shooting of Pretti in Minnesota, recently saying he will deescalate his immigration crackdown in the state. \"This has to be in the bill,\" said Sen. Angus King of Maine, an independent who caucuses with Democrats. \"I don't think we could settle for promises.\" King repeatedly voted to reopen the government during the last shutdown, bucking his caucus. \"I can't in good conscience vote for a DHS budget under these circumstances,\" King said, calling for the DHS component to be separated so the rest of the bills can pass. DHS is conducting immigration operations in Maine. Sen. Angus King, I-Maine, arrives for a vote in the Capitol on Thursday, September 28, 2023.Bill Clark | CQ-Roll Call, Inc. | Getty ImagesSchumer, D-N.Y., listed Democrats' demands in a press conference Wednesday. He said Democrats want a DHS funding package to include new guardrails for federal immigration enforcement. Those guardrails include a requirement for warrants for arrests, a ban on federal agents wearing masks, mandatory body cameras and a uniform code of conduct for federal agents. \"Democrats stand ready today to pass the five bipartisan bills in the Senate, but the DHS bill needs serious work,\" Schumer said. \"It's now on Leader Thune to separate out the DHS bill ... and start working with Democrats to rein in ICE.\"Republicans appear to be plowing ahead with plans to vote on all six bills. \"We're voting on this tomorrow,\" said Sen. Markwayne Mullin, R-Okla. \"Anything can change in 24 hours, but our plan is to vote on six bills.\" Should that vote fail and Senate Republicans decide to split off the DHS portion, it would likely require a unanimous consent request on the Senate floor to alter the bill, given the short timeline. Any one senator could object to such a move, drawing out the timeline and further risking a shutdown. \"I've got concerns with that, but I'd have to examine it,\" said Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, when asked by CNBC if he would object to stripping out the DHS bill from the package. Republicans also note that a shutdown at DHS would also mean that the Federal Emergency Management Agency would go unfunded during a winter cold snap that has brought bitter temperatures, ice and snow to a large part of the country. King suggested that a short-term continuing resolution could keep FEMA and other agencies afloat. Any changes the Senate makes to the package would also require reapproval by the House. The House is out of Washington on recess, with plans to return next week — after the shutdown deadline. \"If the bill changes much from what the House already passed, then you've got another steep hill to climb over there,\" Thune said. DHS would largely also be able to keep operating its immigration enforcement apparatus even if it enters into a shutdown. Republicans gave the agency hundreds of billions of dollars in supplemental appropriations as part of the tax and spending package passed last year.",

    "body": "watch nowPresident Donald Trump has \"brought down the temperature\" on Minnesota, the site of major civil unrest over aggressive federal immigration efforts, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Wednesday.Trump is \"urging\" Congress to take action to avoid triggering a partial government shutdown amid disputes over federal funding for the Department of Homeland Security, Bessent told CNBC's \"Squawk on the Street.\"The shutdown could begin at 12:01 a.m. ET on Saturday unless lawmakers come to a resolution on the DHS funding, which a slew of Democrats have rejected in light of the recent killing of nurse Alex Pretti by federal agents in Minneapolis.Trump is \"in constant contact\" with lawmakers \"and he is urging them not to shut down the government,\" Bessent told CNBC.Bessent spoke as the Trump administration tempers its tone after its harsh initial response to two immigration enforcement-related killings in Minneapolis that stirred waves of outrage from Democrats and even some Republicans.The Cabinet secretary declined to make a prediction about whether a shutdown — the second in less than four months — will be averted.\"I don't know what to expect. The Democrats can become unhinged like they were last time, and they don't care. Like, they think this is a way to stop President Trump,\" he said.He also warned that another shutdown could cause further economic harm. \"Especially on the service side, when the government shut down, that never comes back. So, there's a big permanent loss,\" Bessent said.The House of Representatives last week passed a more-than-$1.2 trillion spending package that includes funding for DHS, the agency in charge of federal immigration enforcement.The package, which accounts for the bulk of government spending for the fiscal year ending Sept. 30, requires Democratic support to clear the Senate's 60-vote filibuster threshold. And if the Senate changes what the House already passed, the House would have to return from a prescheduled recess to vote on any amended measure, with little time to spare before a shutdown.Democratic opposition to the spending package rapidly grew after Pretti's killing on Saturday morning. Senate Democrats now say they will vote against the package unless the DHS portion is stripped out, something Republicans have signaled they will not do.Pretti was killed just weeks after another U.S. citizen, Renee Nicole Good, was fatally shot by federal agents in Minneapolis.In both cases, the Trump administration initially came out in full-throated defense of its officers' actions while accusing the slain citizens of domestic terrorism. After widespread blowback — and after new polls showed Trump's immigration approval rating plummeting — the administration has dialed back its tone.Trump said Tuesday, \"we're going to de-escalate a bit\" in Minnesota.But Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., has suggested that that pivot is not enough for Democrats to drop the shutdown threat.\"The fix should come from Congress; the public can't trust the administration to do the right thing on its own,\" Schumer said Tuesday on the Senate floor.\"In the meantime, I will vote no on any legislation that funds [U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement] until it is reined in and overhauled, and Senate Democrats are overwhelmingly united on this issue,\" Schumer said.This is breaking news.

    "body": "Headquarters of Samsung in Mountain View, California, on October 28, 2018. Smith Collection/gado | Archive Photos | Getty ImagesSamsung Electronics shares rose 2.4% Thursday after the company reported an over threefold surge in fourth-quarter operating profits, hitting a new record and beating analysts' estimates, as a memory chip shortage and strong demand for artificial intelligence servers lifted earnings.Here are Samsung's fourth-quarter results compared with LSEG SmartEstimate, which is weighted toward forecasts from analysts who are more consistently accurate:Revenue: 93.8 trillion Korean won ($65.58 billion) vs. 93.318 trillion won expectedOperating profit: 20.1 trillion won vs. 20.018 trillion won expectedThe South Korean technology giant's quarterly revenue rose about 24% from a year earlier to hit a new record. Meanwhile, its operating profit climbed over 200% year over year. The profits surpassed Samsung's long-standing record of 17.6 trillion won set in the third quarter of 2018, while matching Samsung's own guidance of around 20 trillion won. Samsung, South Korea's largest company by market capitalization, is a leading provider of memory chips, semiconductor foundry services and smartphones.The company said in its earnings report that its memory business had helped drive earnings, setting all-time highs for quarterly revenue and operating profit, driven by an overall market price surge, sales of high-bandwidth memory and other high-value-added products. High-bandwidth memory, or HBM, is a type of memory used in chipsets for AI data centers, and Samsung has shifted more focus to the technology over the past year, under its Device Solutions (DS) Division.Makers of AI chipsets, such as Nvidia, have been clamoring for limited supplies of HBM, with demand outpacing supply.As memory companies prioritize capacity to meet that lucrative demand, it has contributed to a shortage across the broader market, pushing up prices of chips used in personal computers and mobile devices.This has been a boon for memory giants like Samsung as well as its rival SK Hynix, which reported record earnings on Wednesday.\"Looking ahead to Q1 2026, the DS Division expects AI and server demand to continue increasing, leading to more opportunities for structural growth,\" the company said.\"In response, the Division will continue to focus on profitability via a strong emphasis on high-performance products,\" it added.Smartphones Samsung's mobile experience and networks businesses, tasked with developing and selling smartphones, tablets, wearables and other devices, posted weaker results in the fourth quarter. Operating profit at the division fell to 1.9 trillion won, down 9.5% from a year earlier and over 45% from the previous quarter. The company said the losses were due to \"reduced launch effects\" from new smartphone models and intense market competition.Looking ahead to the first quarter of 2026, Samsung said it plans to strengthen its AI smartphone push by introducing what it calls \"Agentic AI experiences\" with the launch of its upcoming Galaxy S26 series. Samsung said it also aims to ensure sustained profitability through flagship sales expansion, resource optimization and efforts to strengthen supply stability amid global competitive pressures.",

    "body": "A Home Depot logo is displayed at one of their stores in San Diego, Nov. 8, 2025.Kevin Carter | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesHome Depot on Wednesday laid off 800 workers and said corporate employees will have to return to the office five days per week.In a message to employees, CEO Ted Decker said the changes are intended to increase the company's \"speed and agility.\"\"To extend our industry-leading position, we must position the company to move faster and stay even more closely connected to our customers and frontline associates,\" he wrote in the memo.A corporate spokesperson confirmed that the company is cutting 800 roles. About 150 of the employees were based at Home Depot's headquarters in Atlanta and the rest were in remote jobs, with most in the technology organization of the company and some on other corporate teams, she said.In the employee memo, Decker said the five-day in-office policy will begin the week of April 6. He said the changes are \"essential to simplify our business and focus our energy on the priorities ahead.\"\"In-person engagement enables more meaningful support for store and field associates, drives results and reinforces our people-centric culture and inverted pyramid,\" he said.Home Depot's sales have been weaker than expected, as the retail giant waits for housing turnover and significant home improvement spending to pick up again after a boom in demand during the Covid pandemic. Company leaders have attributed slower demand to higher mortgage rates, economic uncertainty and consumers' hesitance to spring for pricier projects.The retailer missed Wall Street's earnings expectations for the third straight quarter when it posted results in November. It said that it expects full-year fiscal 2025 sales to rise about 3% and comparable sales, which take out the impact of one-time factors like store openings and calendar differences, to be slightly positive.Shares of Home Depot have fallen about 10% over the past year, trailing the S&P 500's 15% gains over the same period. So far this year, Home Depot's stock is up about 9%, however, ahead of the S&P 500's nearly 2% gains.Home Depot will report its fiscal fourth-quarter earnings on Feb. 24.",

Both companies are owned by Ernest Garcia II, Carvana's largest shareholder and the father of the online retailer's chief executive.CNBC did not independently verify the authenticity of the financial results, which Gotham said it obtained via the Freedom of Information Act.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconCarvana stockBroadly, the firm accuses Carvana's earnings of being dependent on DriveTime's debt issuance, \"toxic\" loans and accounting, and accounting irregularities.Carvana did not immediately respond for comment on the report from Gotham City Research, which is the latest in a string of short sellers targeting the company in recent years.Disbanded short seller Hindenburg Research last year disclosed a bet against Carvana, claiming the online used-car retailer's turnaround was a \"mirage\" that was being propped up by unstable loans and accounting manipulation.Shares of Carvana have been on an unprecedented ride for the company since a bankruptcy scare around late 2022. The stock's price has jumped from less than $5 a share during that time to close Tuesday at more than $477 per share.Carvana shares closed Wednesday at $410.04, down 14.2% — marking the company's second-worst trading day in the past year.",

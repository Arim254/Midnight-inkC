    "body": "Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr. speaks during the daily briefing in the Brady Briefing Room of the White House in Washington, DC, on Jan. 7, 2026. Mandel Ngan | AFP | Getty ImagesHealth and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins on Wednesday shared new U.S. nutrition guidelines, advising Americans to eat more \"real food\" and reduce their intake of highly processed foods and added sugars.The government's new food pyramid replaces the MyPlate diagram released under President Barack Obama, and emphasizes protein, full-fat dairy and vegetables. The most significant changes under the updated guidelines include prioritizing protein over carbohydrates, recommending full-fat dairy instead of low-fat options, and cutting out processed foods like white bread, chips and candy.\"Healthy fats\" like full-fat dairy and avocados have also been added to the pyramid, and the guidelines recommend cooking with olive oil, butter or beef tallow. \"We are ending the war on saturated fats,\" Kennedy said at a White House press briefing on Wednesday.Similarly, the website announcing the new guidelines declares, \"We are ending the war on protein.\"Kennedy called the new guidelines the \"most significant reset of federal nutrition policy in history.\"Source: HHSHis \"Make America Healthy Again\" agenda has taken aim at processed foods and sugary beverages, while pushing more controversial dietary changes like cooking with beef tallow and consuming more red meat, which many public health experts say can lead to cardiovascular and other health issues in excess. The backbone of the MAHA platform is that healthier diets will prevent chronic disease, according to Kennedy.In response to the MAHA push, food and beverage giants like PepsiCo and J.M. Smucker have announced plans to phase out synthetic dyes and other artificial ingredients. Since Kennedy's confirmation, the industry has feared greater regulation, particularly regarding ultra-processed foods, although major policy changes haven't happened yet. The USDA and HHS release updated dietary guidelines every five years. While many Americans may brush off the recommendations, the guidelines are intended as a public health tool to inform health-care providers, federal agencies, policymakers and nutrition experts. The food industry also takes them into account, given the wide reach of the guidelines. Changes in the dietary recommendations will trickle down to school lunches and federal nutrition programs. The consumer advocacy group Center for Science in the Public Interest estimates that 1 in 4 Americans will be directly affected by changes in the guidelines. More than a year ago, an advisory committee of health and nutrition experts said that Americans should eat more plant-based food and low-fat dairy and consume less red meat and sugary beverages, based on a review of scientific evidence. However, it is unclear if the USDA and HHS used the report to inform the dietary guidelines announced on Wednesday.",

Marco Bello | ReutersJPMorgan said its asset management division has fully parted ways with controversial proxy advisors for shareholder votes. In an internal memo, the firm said it no longer needs third-party data collection or voting recommendations. Instead, it launched an artificial intelligence tool, Proxy IQ, to aggregate and analyze proxy data from 3,000 annual company meetings. Proxy advisors such as Institutional Shareholder Services and Glass Lewis typically provide research and voting recommendations. JPMorgan said it is the first major investment firm to eliminate reliance on such companies. The Wall Street Journal first reported the news earlier Wednesday.Proxy advisors have been under fire from President Donald Trump, who signed an executive order in December to reassess existing rules. Trump said the proxy advisors \"regularly use their substantial power to advance and prioritize radical politically-motivated agendas.\" Tesla CEO Elon Musk also lashed out at proxy advisors last October, calling them \"corporate terrorists,\" after ISS recommended shareholders reject his nearly $1 trillion pay package.",

The president said the purchases will include agricultural products, medicine, medical devices and equipment to improve Venezuela's grid and energy facilities. Trump said Tuesday that Venezuela would turn over 30 million to 50 million barrels of oil to the U.S. after the overthrow of President Nicolás Maduro. The oil will be sold at market prices, Trump said. The sales, if executed, would total more than $2 billion at oil's Wednesday closing price.  Energy Secretary Chris Wright said Wednesday that the U.S. will control Venezuela's oil sales indefinitely. \"We're going to market the crude coming out of Venezuela — first this backed up stored oil and then indefinitely, going forward, we will sell the production that comes out of Venezuela into the marketplace,\" Wright said at Goldman Sachs' annual energy conference in Miami.\"We need to have that leverage and that control of those oil sales to drive the changes that simply must happen in Venezuela,\" the energy secretary said. The funds from the sales will be deposited in U.S. controlled accounts, Wright said. \"We're not taking their oil,\" the energy secretary told CNBC in an interview. The funds from the sales will be brought back to Venezuela, he said. ",

Shares of Alphabet rose more than 2% on Wednesday, closing at $322.03. Meanwhile, Apple's market cap closed Wednesday at $3.84 trillion as shares slid more than 4% over the last five days.The positional inversion in market cap underscores the different directions that Alphabet and Apple are heading in when it comes to their respective strategies for artificial intelligence. Alphabet ended 2025 as one of the top performers on Wall Street after putting together the pieces for its AI comeback. In November, the company unveiled Ironwood, the seventh generation of its tensor processing units, a custom AI chip that has emerged as a potential alternative to Nvidia's offerings. Then in December, Google introduced Gemini 3 to rave reviews.Shares of Alphabet jumped 65% in 2025, the company's sharpest rally since 2009, when the stock doubled coming out of the financial crisis. CEO Sundar Pichai has repeatedly said the company is responding to soaring demand. On Alphabet's October earnings call, he said that Google's cloud business signed more deals over $1 billion in 2025 through the third quarter of the year than in the two prior years combined.Meanwhile, Apple has remained largely absent from the tech industry's AI race that kicked off when OpenAI launched ChatGPT in late 2022. Apple was supposed to launch the next generation of its Siri AI assistant last year, but the company wound up delaying that release. Apple has promised to launch the \"more personal Siri\" in 2026.

    "body": "watch nowPresident Donald Trump said the U.S. should bar large institutional investors from buying single-family homes, arguing that corporate ownership has helped push housing further out of reach for everyday Americans.\"For a very long time, buying and owning a home was considered the pinnacle of the American Dream. It was the reward for working hard, and doing the right thing, but now, because of the Record High Inflation caused by Joe Biden and the Democrats in Congress, that American Dream is increasingly out of reach for far too many people, especially younger Americans,\" Trump said in a Truth Social post Wednesday.\"It is for that reason, and much more, that I am immediately taking steps to ban large institutional investors from buying more single-family homes, and I will be calling on Congress to codify it. People live in homes, not corporations,\" he added.Private equity giants, real estate investment trusts and other large institutional investors have amassed sizable portfolios of single-family rental homes over the past decade. Many have argued that these investments have reduced housing supply for would-be homeowners and helped drive up prices. Invitation Homes, which is the largest renter of single-family homes in the country, tumbled 6%. Shares of Blackstone, an investing firm that owns and rents single-family homes, dropped more than 5%. Private equity firm Apollo Global Management also declined over 5%.The national median existing single-family home price was $426,800 in the third quarter of 2025 after hitting a record high of $435,300 in the summer, according to the National Association of Realtors. The average rate on a 30-year fixed mortgage is currently at 6.19%, according to Mortgage News Daily.Blackstone was the largest private-equity owner of apartments in the U.S. with more than 230,000 units, according to data from the Private Equity Stakeholder Project released last year. Blackstone in recent years has spent billions acquiring real estate companies such as Tricon Residential, American Campus Communities and AIR Communities.Trump did not provide details on how such a ban would be implemented. Trump said he plans to outline additional housing and affordability proposals during a speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos in two weeks.Senator Tim Scott, head of the committee overseeing housing in the Senate, said while he embraced Trump's push for affordability, the better way to go forward would be his bipartisan \"ROAD to Housing\" bill.\"2026 must be the year we get housing affordability right for working families. I welcome President Trump's desire to look for ways to create more homeowners, especially first-time homeowners,\" Scott said in a statement to CNBC's Emily Wilkins. \"My focus is on advancing meaningful solutions that expand housing supply and lower costs — including building on our unanimously passed ROAD to Housing Act — because that's how we make the American Dream more attainable.\"— CNBC's Alex Harring contributed reporting.",

    "body": "Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai.Klaudia Radecka | Nurphoto | Getty ImagesGoogle and Character.AI will settle with families who sued the companies over harm to minors, including suicides, allegedly caused by artificial intelligence chatbots. According to court documents filed this week, the families and companies have agreed to work out settlement terms.In one case, plaintiff Megan Garcia sued Google and Character.AI after her son died from suicide. The complaint claims that Character.AI's chatbot engaged the plaintiff's 14-year-old son, Sewell Setzer III, in harmful interactions, and alleges negligence, wrongful death, deceptive trade practices and product liability.\"Parties have agreed to a mediated settlement in principle to resolve all claims between them in the above-referenced matter,\" one filing says. \"The Parties request that this matter be stayed so that the Parties may draft, finalize, and execute formal settlement documents.\"The settlement agreements this week also came from families in Colorado, Texas and New York, according to documents. Details have not yet been revealed.In August 2024, Google agreed to a $2.7 billion licensing deal and hired Character.AI founders Noam Shazeer and Daniel De Freitas, who both previously worked at the search company and were specifically named in the lawsuits. Shazeer and De Freitas joined Google's AI unit DeepMind.In the more than three years since OpenAI's launch of ChatGPT kicked off the generative AI boom, the technology has rapidly evolved from text-based chats to sophisticated pictures, videos and characters that respond to simple human prompts. Companies in the space now face the heightened challenge of dealing with the potential harmful consequences of the technology.Families have filed a flurry of cases involving suicides and deaths by people who turned to these products for companionship and therapy. In October, Character.AI announced that it would ban users under age 18 from having free-ranging chats, including romantic and therapeutic conversations, with its AI chatbots.A spokesman for the lawyer representing families involved in this week's settlement said the plaintiffs had no comment. Google couldn't be reached for comment, while Character.AI said it couldn't comment at this time. Google's advancements in AI contributed to it being the top megacap performer on Wall Street in 2025. The company launched the latest version of its tensor processing unit chips in November and its Gemini 3 chatbot last month.

    "body": "watch nowPresident Donald Trump on Wednesday said he \"will not permit\" defense companies to issue dividends or stock buybacks until those firms speed up their production of military equipment and address his other complaints about the industry.Trump, in a lengthy Truth Social post, also took aim at defense contractors' executive pay packages, calling them \"exorbitant and unjustifiable.\"\"Defense Companies are not producing our Great Military Equipment rapidly enough and, once produced, not maintaining it properly or quickly,\" he wrote.Until those companies build new production plants, \"no Executive should be allowed to make in excess of $5 Million Dollars,\" Trump declared.Shares of General Dynamics, Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman each fell about 3% following Trump's comments.Trump later singled out Raytheon as \"the least responsive to the needs of the Department of War, the slowest in increasing their volume, and the most aggressive spending on their Shareholders rather than the needs and demands of the United States Military.\"He said that the Pentagon will cut its business ties with Raytheon unless it \"steps up\" on investment in plants and equipment, adding that \"under no circumstances\" can the company do any more stock buybacks in the meantime.Shares of RTX, the parent of Raytheon, slid an additional 2% in after-hours trading after closing down 2.5%. A major defense contractor, RTX manufactures advanced air-to-air missiles and many of the components in the F-35 fighter jet.It was not initially clear what impact or binding force, if any, Trump's announcement would have on major defense companies' financial activities.

    "body": "watch nowVenezuela will ship sanctioned oil to the U.S. indefinitely, sources close to the White House told CNBC on Wednesday. President Donald Trump said Tuesday that Venezuela will turn over 30 million to 50 million barrels of sanctioned oil, which will be sold at market prices. \"That money will be controlled by me, as President of the United States of America, to ensure it is used to benefit the people of Venezuela and the United States,\" Trump said in a social media post. The 50 million barrels are only the first tranche and shipments will continue indefinitely, the sources said. U.S. sanctions against Venezuela will be selectively rolled back to enable the transportation and sale of the oil on global markets, the sources said. Proceeds from the oil sales will settle in U.S. controlled accounts, the sources said, with the money released back to Venezuela at the discretion of the U.S., they said. Energy Secretary Chris Wright later confirmed the plan at a conference hosted by Goldman Sachs in Miami on Wednesday.\"We're going to market the crude coming out of Venezuela,\" Wright said. \"First this backed up, stored oil and then indefinitely, going forward, we will sell the production that comes out of Venezuela into the marketplace.\" Previously, the sanctioned oil would have gone mostly to China but will now be rerouted to the U.S. instead. Trump said Tuesday that storage ships will transport the oil directly to receiving docks in the U.S. Venezuela, a founding member of OPEC, has the largest proven crude oil reserves in the world. But it is only producing about 800,000 barrels per day, according to data from energy consulting firm Kpler. The U.S., by contrast, is currently producing about 13.8 million bpd.Trump has made clear that U.S. investment in Venezuela's oil sector is a central objective of the military action that ousted President Nicolas Maduro last Saturday. The president has called on major U.S. oil companies to rebuild the South American nation's energy infrastructure system, from wellheads to pipelines, though the companies have so far been largely silent. Wright will meet with oil executives about Venezuela at the Goldman conference. \"Secretary Wright remains in close contact with U.S. oil companies and plans to meet with several of them at the Goldman Sachs Energy Conference in Miami on Wednesday,\" a Department of Energy spokesperson told CNBC. ",

    "body": "Cheng Xin | Getty ImagesAfter an all-time high and a big tumble for bitcoin last year, industry executives and investors told CNBC that the cryptocurrency could reach new heights in 2026 — but with the potential for huge volatility.In CNBC's annual roundup of bitcoin predictions, several commentators forecast a wide range of prices for bitcoin in 2026, dropping as low as $75,000 and rising as high as $225,000.Last October, bitcoin hit a record high of over $126,000 before falling later in the year to lows of around $80,000, according to CoinMetrics. Bitcoin is sitting around 30% lower than its all-time high. Last year's crypto market was buoyed by what was viewed as a more favorable regulatory environment in the U.S. under President Donald Trump, and increasing interest from larger institutional investors and traditional financial players like banks. Meanwhile, there was a boom in so-called digital asset treasury (DAT) companies, which accumulate large amounts of bitcoin and other digital coins. Stock Chart IconStock chart iconBitcoin price over the last year.At the same time, debate continues over the valuations of technology stocks and whether the artificial intelligence boom will turn into a bubble. The crypto sell-off at the end of the year came against that backdrop. As investors reassessed risk assets and crypto holders sold digital currencies, there were forced liquidations, which exacerbated the selling. This has created a tough backdrop for 2026.\"We are in a complex investing environment. Equity valuations are stretched, the geopolitical environment is chaotic and evolving, there are fears about the near-term durability of AI capex deployment, monetary policy conditions appear to be shifting, and the U.S. midterm elections are on the horizon,\" Alex Thorn, head of research at Galaxy, told CNBC. \"Against this backdrop, the outlook for bitcoin in 2026 is tough to predict.\"Here are some of the boldest forecasts for the price of bitcoin in 2026.Carol Alexander: $75,000-$150,000In 2026, bitcoin will remain in a \"high-volatility range\" of between $75,000 and $150,000, \"with the centre of gravity around\" $110,000, according to Carol Alexander, professor of finance at the University of Sussex.That's \"as the market digests a transition from retail-led cycles to institutionally distributed liquidity.\" Historically, bitcoin's price has been driven by retail traders. But over the past two years, an increasing number of institutional investors have been involved in the space. Many cryptocurrency experts expect this to continue this year.Alexander has had a good track record in her bitcoin predictions over the last few years. But, she previously said bitcoin could hit $200,000 in 2026, which did not materialize. She did however, say that by the summer of 2025, bitcoin could be trading \"around $150,000 plus or minus $50,000.\" Indeed, during the summer of 2025, bitcoin was trading above $100,000. CoinShares: $120,000-$170,000James Butterfill, head of research for crypto-focused asset manager CoinShares, expects to see bitcoin in a range of between $120,000 and $170,000 in 2026, with \"more constructive price action likely occurring in the second half of the year.\"Butterfill said investors will be watching to see who the new chair of the U.S. Federal Reserve will be after Jerome Powell's tenure ends in May. The new person is \"likely to be dovish,\" but markets will wait for clarity \"before repricing risk assets more decisively,\" Butterfill said.Investors are also focusing on whether a piece of legislation in the U.S. known as the Clarity Act will become law in 2026. The Clarity Act seeks to create a framework for regulating digital assets. \"Regulation has been a persistent overhang; resolution here would be a meaningful catalyst,\" Butterfill said.Butterfill cited risks such as inflation shocks or policy errors from the Fed as reasons why there might be demand for \"alternative, non-sovereign monetary assets\" like bitcoin. In December 2024, Butterfill forecast that bitcoin could fall to around $80,000 in 2025, which it did. He also said bitcoin could rise as high as $150,000 last year, which it did not manage to achieve. Standard Chartered: $150,000Standard Chartered has a bitcoin price forecast of $150,000 for 2026, which it cut in December from a previous call of $300,000. Geoff Kendrick, the bank's global head of digital asset research, said that the price decline seen in 2025 was \"within expected bounds.\" However, the price action has led Standard Chartered to revise its call.\"Specifically, we think buying by Bitcoin digital asset treasury companies (DATs) is likely over, as valuations ... no longer support further Bitcoin DAT expansion. We expect a consolidation rather than outright selling, but DAT buying is unlikely to provide further support,\" Kendrick said in his note from December.watch nowDATs are entities that buy and hold cryptocurrency, mainly bitcoin, and attempt to outperform the market. However, a plunge in crypto prices has hurt the valuations of these firms, which some analysts have suggested may undermine their ability to raise additional funding. Kendrick suggests these DATs are unlikely to be buying the same amount of bitcoin as before to support the market.Meanwhile, bitcoin exchange-traded funds, or ETFs, which allow investors to track the price of the digital currency without owning the underlying asset, are likely to drive prices in 2026, according to Kendrick. \"As a result, we now think future Bitcoin price increases will effectively be driven by one leg only – ETF buying,\" Kendrick said. Maple Finance: $175,000Sidney Powell, CEO of Maple Finance, said he has a price target of $175,000 for bitcoin this year, buoyed by interest rate cuts and \"increasing institutional adoption of bitcoin.\" In December 2024, Powell predicted there would be some corrections to the price in 2025, which did indeed occur. He also had a bullish 2025 call for bitcoin of between $180,000 and $200,000, which was not achieved. However, he said a big milestone for bitcoin in 2026 will be when bitcoin-backed lending exceeds $100 billion. \"Bitcoin holders are increasingly sophisticated, they don't want to sell their BTC; they want to borrow against it. This creates a virtuous cycle: less selling pressure, more utility, higher prices.\"Bit Mining: $75,000 to $225,000 Youwei Yang, chief economist at Bit Mining, is also predicting continued volatility with bitcoin. Yang said he expects a wide trading range for bitcoin in 2026 of between $75,000 and $225,00. \"2026 could be a strong year for Bitcoin, supported by potential rate cuts and a more accommodating regulatory stance toward crypto,\" Yang said. \"However, heightened volatility is likely amid ongoing macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainties.\" In December 2024, Yang's previous call was partially correct. He predicted that bitcoin could fall to around $80,000 in 2025, which it did. He also forecast it could trade between $180,000 and $190,000, which did not materialize. Nexo: $150,000-$200,000Nexo's 2025 call of $250,000 for bitcoin \"was less a rejection of its long-term thesis and more a consequence of market mechanics colliding with a shifting macro backdrop,\" according to Iliya Kalchev, an analyst at the cryptocurrency exchange. Kalchev said this price didn't materialize as long-term holders who accumulated bitcoin at lower prices began to sell, which was then purchased by institutional investors.But 2026 \"appears more constructive,\" Kalchev said with the phase of long-term holders selling their holdings coming to an end and institutional allocations \"gradually rise from still-modest levels.\" \"Bitcoin is entering 2026 with less supply risk and a broader capital base,\" Kalchev said.If financial conditions turn more supportive – through easing policy, a softer dollar, or renewed liquidity expansion – Bitcoin could revisit and exceed prior highs,\" he added.

    "body": "Members of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement stand guard after a driver of a vehicle was shot in Minneapolis, Minnesota, Jan. 7, 2026.Tim Evans | ReutersU.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents fatally shot a woman in her car on Wednesday on a residential street in Minneapolis, authorities said.Videos of the incident that were posted on social media show the woman being shot within seconds by an ICE agent who was standing at the front of her SUV when she began driving off after being told to exit her vehicle. The shooting occurred in front of other people on Portland Avenue who were opposing ICE activities in Minneapolis.The Star-Tribune newspaper identified the dead woman as Renee Nicole Good, citing Good's mother as the source of that information.Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and another top DHS official both claimed that the dead woman, who police said had been shot in the head, was engaged in an \"act of domestic terrorism\" by intentionally trying to run down ICE agents.\"Today, ICE officers in Minneapolis were conducting targeted operations when rioters began blocking ICE officers and one of these violent rioters weaponized her vehicle, attempting to run over our law enforcement officers in an attempt to kill them — an act of domestic terrorism,\" said Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin in a post on X. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey scoffed at that account, citing video footage they had seen.Frey called DHS' claims \"bulls---\" and \"a garbage narrative.\" He said the woman was 37 years old. MS NOW, citing people familiar with the matter, said the woman was a U.S. citizen.\"That's so stupid\" that she was killed, Good's mother, Donna Ganger, told a Star-Tribune reporter after being told some of the shooting's details. \"She was probably terrified.\"The shooting came during increased tension over a surge of more than 2,000 ICE, DHS and other federal agents to Minneapolis and St. Paul for immigration enforcement, criticism of the city's large Somali population by President Donald Trump and the Trump administration's focus on a series of frauds against social service programs administered by Minnesota that receive federal support.A Border Patrol Tactical Unit agent sprays pepper spray into the face of a protestor attempting to block an immigration officer vehicle from leaving the scene where a woman was shot and killed by a federal agent earlier, in Minneapolis, Minn. on Wednesday, Jan. 7, 2026. Alex Kormann | The Minnesota Star Tribune | Getty ImagesWalz blasted DHS for saying they knew the motives of the dead woman without doing an investigation. The governor said he had issued a so-called warning order to state officials to prepare to deploy Minnesota National Guard troops.\"We have someone dead, in their care, for no reason whatsoever,\" Walz said at a press conference.\"We've been warning for weeks that the Trump administration's dangerous, sensationalized operations are a threat to our public safety, that someone was going to get hurt. Just yesterday, I said exactly that,\" Walz said.\"What we're seeing is the consequences of governance designed to generate fear, headlines and conflict. It's governing by reality TV, and today that recklessness cost [someone] their life,\" he said.\"I have a simple message: We don't need any further help from the federal government,\" Walz said. \"To Donald Trump and Kristi Noem: You've done enough.\"Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O'Hara said his department secured the \"crime scene\" and that the incident is being investigated by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension. O'Hara said the state bureau will probe \"whether any state laws ... have been violated.\"An onlooker holds a sign that reads \"Shame\" as members of law enforcement work the scene following a suspected shooting by an ICE agent during federal law enforcement operations on Jan. 7, 2026 in Minneapolis, Minnesota.Stephen Maturen | Getty ImagesVideo from the scene posted on social media shows ICE officers pulling up to a group of cars parked on a residential street.\"Get the f--- out of our neighborhood,\" a woman is heard saying on the video, apparently from behind the camera.ICE agents then quickly exited their truck and walked up to a vehicle blocking the road, saying, \"Ma'am, get out of the car, out of the car, get out of the f---ing car,\" the video shows. One agent grabbed the handle of the driver's side door and tried to open it, and reached inside the vehicle, the video shows.The car then backs up slightly and begins pulling away, the video shows.Another agent, who had been standing up the road from the woman's vehicle, walks up to the front of the car and draws his pistol and quickly fires toward the car's windshield as the vehicle begins moving forward at him, according to videos. He appears to have fired at least three shots.One video aired by KSTP 5 in Minneapolis shows the agent who pulled his pistol appearing to lean on or toward the woman's SUV vehicle at the time it began moving forward, and then firing.Less than three seconds pass between the car reversing and moving forward, and the beginning of the gunfire.\"Oh f---ing, God!\" a woman screams on the video.Members of the community and media take cover as Border Patrol agents use chemical irritants to disperse a crowd trying to prevent them from leaving the scene where a driver was shot by a U.S. immigration agent, according to local and federal officials, in Minneapolis, Minnesota, U.S., Jan. 7, 2026. Tim Evans | ReutersThe vehicle that was shot at quickly crashes into the back of a car parked a short distance down the street.\"Dude, you did a murder, for what?\" a man yells on the video.A separate video, which begins after the shooting took place, shows a man attempting to approach the crashed car while identifying himself as a doctor.While the man is in the street, a black SUV approaches and multiple armed agents jump out and shout at him to back up, according to that video.Noem, the DHS secretary, during a speech said, \"Our ICE officers were out in an enforcement action.\"\"They got stuck in the snow because of the adverse weather that is in Minneapolis,\" Noem said. \"They were attempting to push out their vehicle and a woman attacked them, and those surrounding them, and attempted to run them over and ram them with her vehicle.\"Noem said, \"An officer of ours acted quickly and defensively shot to protect himself and the people around him and my understanding is that she was hit and is deceased.\"There is no footage on the video supporting Noem's claim that the officers were trying to push their vehicle out of any snow, or that the woman attacked them as they were doing so right before the shooting occurred.The truck carrying the agents was driving up the street when it stopped and the agents got out. The street was clear of any snow.Walz, in a tweet said, \"I've seen the video.

    "body": "OpenAI CEO Sam Altman attends an event to pitch AI for businesses in Tokyo, Feb. 3, 2025.Kim Kyung-hoon | ReutersOpenAI on Wednesday announced ChatGPT Health, which will allow users to securely connect their medical records and wellness apps to the artificial intelligence chatbot.ChatGPT Health is not intended for diagnosis and treatment, and it's not supposed to replace medical care, OpenAI said. Rather, the experience is supposed to help users navigate everyday questions, and it aims to make ChatGPT's responses more relevant by grounding them in a user's own health information. \"ChatGPT Health is another step toward turning ChatGPT into a personal super-assistant that can support you with information and tools to achieve your goals across any part of your life,\" Fidji Simo, CEO of applications at OpenAI, wrote in a post on Substack.OpenAI said ChatGPT Health has its own dedicated space within the chatbot, so all of those files, conversations and connected apps are stored separately from other chats. Information and memories from ChatGPT Health will not flow outside of that space, and those conversations will not be used to train OpenAI's foundation models, the company said. The startup has partnered with b.well, which provides the health data connectivity infrastructure that will allow users to share their medical records with ChatGPT Health. Users will also be able to connect to Apple Health, MyFitnessPal, Weight Watchers, the lab testing startup Function and other data. Services can be connected from tools or apps in settings.Read more CNBC tech newsThis climate startup is taking recycling to the next level, with shower water beerElon Musk's xAI raises $20 billion from investors including Nvidia, Cisco, FidelityMeta hires Microsoft exec, former Trump deputy as chief legal officerHuang says Nvidia seeing 'very high' Chinese customer demand for H200 AI chipsChatGPT Health was developed in \"close collaboration\" with physicians, OpenAI said. OpenAI has deepened its push into health care in recent months. After the company launched its GPT-5 model in August, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman told CNBC that health care was \"maybe the area where there's the strongest improvement of any category.\" In May, it released a benchmark called Health Bench that is designed to measure how well AI models perform in realistic health scenarios.The startup said Wednesday that \"hundreds of millions\" of people ask health and wellness questions each week. ChatGPT Health will initially be made available to a small group of early users that will offer feedback and refine the experience. OpenAI said it will expand access in the coming weeks.

Stefani Reynolds | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesTesla CEO Elon Musk said Tuesday that it will take several years before Nvidia's new autonomous vehicle models pose serious competition to the company's Full Self-Driving (Supervised) technology.During the CES conference in Las Vegas on Tuesday, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang announced Alpamayo, a family of open artificial intelligence models for autonomous development.Musk responded to the reveal in an X post from a user who likened the system to Tesla's FSD. Musk said it would take many years before self-driving technology becomes much safer than a human driver.\"The legacy car companies won't design the cameras and AI computers into their cars at scale until several years after that,\" he said in a post. \"So this is maybe a competitive pressure on Tesla in 5 or 6 years, but probably longer.\"Read more CNBC tech newsThis climate startup is taking recycling to the next level, with shower water beerElon Musk's xAI raises $20 billion from investors including Nvidia, Cisco, FidelityMeta hires Microsoft exec, former Trump deputy as chief legal officerHuang says Nvidia seeing 'very high' Chinese customer demand for H200 AI chipsNvidia described Alpamayo as a vision language action model that applies \"humanlike thinking\" to self-driving systems in order to make decisions about rare or novel scenarios.The billionaire said in a separate X post on Tuesday that Nvidia will find it \"easy to get to 99% and then super hard to solve the long tail of the distribution.\"Huang praised Musk's FSD stack as \"world-class\" and \"state-of-the-art\" during a Q&A on Tuesday. Unlike Tesla, however, Huang said that Nvidia develops full AV stacks for other auto companies rather than manufacturing the self-driving cars themselves.\"Our system is really quite pervasive because we're a technology platform provider — that's the primary difference,\" Huang said.FSD has been central to Tesla's long-term vision and revenue growth strategy.The company launched a limited robotaxi service in Austin, Texas, last summer. Tesla also operates a ride-hailing service in San Francisco, but there is a driver behind the wheel at all times.Although Musk has been promising self-driving EV cars for over a decade, he said last August that the company is training a new FSD model.watch now",

The company is best known for developing a family of large language models called Claude.Amazon has invested billions of dollars in Anthropic, and in November, Microsoft and Nvidia announced plans to invest up to $5 billion and up to $10 billion, respectively. Anthropic is racing to stay ahead of competitors like Google and OpenAI, which has seen its valuation swell to $500 billion.

    "body": "A 2025 poll from the C.S. Mott Children's Hospital at the University of Michigan asked American parents of children ages one to 18 about their views on various child health topics including bullying, internet safety, lack of physical activity, parental stress and diet.The Mott poll report, released in August, found that a majority of parents surveyed, 69%, think the physical health of American children and teens is getting worse. And even more parents are worried about their kids' emotional wellbeing: 83% believe the mental health of U.S. children and teens is also on the decline.Results of the poll also show that parents believe social media, too much screen time, and internet safety to be some of the top concerns kids are facing today.\"Since the increased use of social media starting around 2010, the prevalence of mental health problems in youth has also increased significantly,\" according to the report. \"This increase, particularly in depression, anxiety and suicidal thoughts continued through the COVID-19 pandemic years.\"Jonathan Haidt, social scientist and author of \"The Anxious Generation,\" is one of the many experts sounding an alarm about the connection between increased anxiety and depression among young people and smartphones and social media.\"All these devices are designed to keep kids scrolling for hours and hours,\" he previously told CNBC Make It. \"The average screen time is eight to 10 hours, not including school.\" \"We have to roll that back if we want any hope for them to grow up healthy,\" he said.Haidt encourages parents to be more intentional about reducing their child's use of devices and social media. Here, he and Jean Twenge, a psychology professor and author of \"10 Rules for Raising Kids in a High-Tech World,\" offer up some recommendations for how parents can work to get that done.No smartphones before high schoolHaidt argues for a clear boundary: Kids should not get a smartphone before they reach high school. A global study of 27,969 18-to-24-year-olds by nonprofit Sapien Labs found that mental wellbeing improved the older the age of first ownership of a smartphone. Haidt also recommends parents refrain from enabling the use of social media on kids' phones before the age of 16.When kids get their devices, Haidt suggests parents have a designated place for them.\"They live on the kitchen counter,\" Haidt said as an example. \"If you need it, you check it out.\"No screens in the bedroom overnight Twenge advocates for keeping screens out of the bedroom overnight.\"That's just a situation where there's, kind of, no argument: 'You do not need that phone in your bedroom when you are supposed to be sleeping. Period. End of story. Mic drop. We're done,'\" Twenge previously told CNBC Make It.Devices in the bedroom can disrupt children's sleep, whether they're up late scrolling or their notifications are waking them up. \"Not getting enough sleep is a risk factor for just about everything we'd like our kids to avoid, from getting sick to feeling depressed,\" Twenge wrote in her book \"10 Rules for Raising Kids in a High-Tech World.\"Haidt would go a step further: no screens in the bedroom whatsoever, he said.More free play outside To ensure kids don't get too sucked into their devices, Haidt also recommends parents encourage them to spend time outside with friends.Communities can decide to enact what he calls \"free play Fridays.\"\"Everyone knows that's when kids get together at the park, they play baseball, football, whatever,\" he previously told Make It. \"Maybe they just stay at the school playground.\"Ultimately, playing with friends and without screens is \"the most fun kids can have,\" he said. They might have so much, they'll ask to continue spending time with their friends over the weekend. Want to give your kids the ultimate advantage?

    "body": "With just a few trading days left this year, 2025 looks to have been another hot year for stocks. The S&P 500 has returned more than 19% since Jan. 1 as of market close on Monday. Barring a year-end disaster, it will mark the third consecutive year of double-digit returns for investors in the broad U.S. stock market. Of course, past performance is no guarantee of future results, and financial pros generally caution against making wholesale changes to your strategy based on short-term stock market prognostications. But if you're invested in the broad stock market, many investment analysts believe that 2026 has the potential to be another great year for your portfolio. \"Certainly we're at a point where we've had incredibly strong performance from U.S. equity markets over the last three years. We don't think that that means that we can't have another good year next year,\" says Kristy Akullian, head of iShares investment strategy for the Americas at BlackRock. \"We are still pretty optimistic in terms of our outlook for U.S. equities. We're pretty upbeat, relatively bullish.\"Wall Street expects corporate earnings to continue to rapidly grow in 2026. On average, analysts expect companies in the S&P 500 to boost earnings by 15.5% next year, up from an estimated 13.2% in 2025 and 12.1% in 2024, according to data analytics firm LSEG. Additionally, the U.S. and global economy appear to be on healthy footing. Analysts at Goldman Sachs expect 2.6% U.S. gross domestic product growth in 2026 and a 2.8% growth in the global economy. That's slightly higher than consensus estimates, but generally, any positive momentum for the economy next year is probably a good sign for stocks, says Ryan Detrick, chief market strategist at The Carson Group. \"We simply don't see a recession next year,\" he says. \"And when you don't have a recession, the S&P 500 is up double-digits almost 70% of the time.\"Indeed, since 1950, the S&P 500 has posted calendar-year returns of 10% or more 68% of the time and a positive return 86% of the time, according to the Carson Group. Overall, Detrick expects the S&P 500 to record gains of 12% to 15% in 2026. What market projections mean for your portfolio in 2026A huge factor that market prognosticators are baking into their assumptions is continued spending on and adoption of artificial intelligence technology. \"The ongoing wave of AI-driven physical investment is expected to be a powerful force, reminiscent of past periods of major capital expansion such as the development of railroads in the mid-19th century and the late-1990s information and telecommunications surge,\" Vanguard analysts wrote in their 2026 outlook. When markets are expecting a serious paradigm shift, you always run the risk of a pullback should progress stall, says Jeffrey Buchbinder, chief equity strategist at LPL Financial. \"We would argue that AI disappointment is the No. 1 risk market in 2026,\" he says. \"That could take several forms. It could come from doubts that money will be there to pay for all this or concerns that it will not translate into data center construction that the market seems to be counting on.\"Buchbinder says he could see an AI-related pullback rankling markets in 2026. Even with that risk in mind, he and others believe that continued AI adoption — and the productivity it may bring — should drive the economy and stock market upward in the coming year. Based on LPL's 2026 \"fair value\" estimate for the S&P 500, analysts at the firm believe stocks could rise 5.7% to 7.2% from current levels next year. Analysts don't expect AI to do all of the heavy lifting in the stock market. Even non-AI stocks should benefit from more business-friendly tax laws and a Federal Reserve that's willing to continue slashing interest rates next year, says Akullian. \"I would characterize our U.S. equity outlook as AI optimism paired with sensible diversification,\" she says. Rather than trying to figure out where the winners will be or timing the market, you'd be wise to invest consistently, and across a variety of assets, Akullian says. And in a year where the global economy could be picking up steam, it may make sense to add some international exposure if your portfolio is heavily tilted toward U.S. stocks, she says. \"Nearly every investor that we speak to could probably benefit from adding some international allocations,\" she says. No matter how optimistic you are about the economy, you should always be prepared for some volatility,  says Detrick.He recommends talking with a financial advisor before making any moves in your portfolio. Even if you're managing your own investments, it's important to have a plan for the market's inevitable downturns.\"As we head into next year, just remember that markets go up and they go down. There are going to be bad days. There are going to be scary headlines,\" he says. \"At some point during this year, if stocks are down between 10% to 15%, that would be perfectly logical and normal. And if you're planning ahead of time for it, you probably won't make rash decisions with your investments.\"Want to give your kids the ultimate advantage? Sign up for CNBC's new online course, How to Raise Financially Smart Kids.

    "body": "As middle management jobs shrink, workplace experts say executives may be underestimating just how crucial these roles are to their companies — especially in the age of AI.The ranks of middle managers, the professionals that bridge senior leaders with frontline employees, have been thinning in recent years. Middle managers made up one-third of all layoffs in 2023, a Bloomberg and Live Data Technologies analysis found. This year, 41% of employees say their companies trimmed down their management layers, according to organizational consulting firm Korn Ferry's Workforce 2025: Power Shifts report, which surveyed 15,000 professionals worldwide. The trend is expected to continue into 2026: One in five (20%) businesses are expected to use AI to flatten their organizational structure, slashing over half of current middle management positions, an October 2024 report from research and advisory firm Gartner found. The layoffs span from major public companies like Amazon and Google to smaller businesses in the U.S., particularly in industries like tech and retail. Some of these companies say they're rectifying pandemic-era over-hiring. Others say they've laid off middle managers as they seek faster, more efficient workflows, and still others cite downsizing due to economic pressures, according to a recent Harris Poll survey on behalf of staffing agency Express Employment Professionals. And while the timing may be coincidental, the tightening comes as some CEOs mandate using artificial intelligence to accomplish work tasks before requesting more headcount.While there can be some upsides to trimming layers of ineffective management, leadership and management experts warn against cutting too deep. They say these positions are a necessary puzzle piece for a successful workplace.\"Middle managers are more important than ever,\" says Deborah Lovich, a C-suite advisor and senior partner at Boston Consulting Group who has counseled leaders on how to improve the employee experience for over 30 years. In today's rapidly changing and uncertain economy where employees are experiencing increased burnout and dissatisfaction and lower confidence, Lovich says middle managers are the ones who can give them the motivation and reassurance they need to be productive. Well-equipped managers aren't just an 'expense'Amid higher inflation, tariffs and economic concerns, many companies are tightening their belts. Middle managers, who typically have higher salaries, can often be the first target in leaner times.To be sure, there can be benefits to thinning out excessive layers of hierarchy.Cutting back on middle managers can help businesses reduce costs, encourage more collaboration between frontline employees and senior executives, and increase a company's overall speed and efficiency, according to a 2020 report from management consulting firm McKinsey & Company.That doesn't mean middle management roles should be eliminated altogether or indiscriminately, says Megg Withinton, vice president of enterprise analytics at HR solutions company Insperity. Instead, she says, these professionals should be better equipped to do their jobs. A competent middle manager builds motivation and productivity for their team and plays a significant role in company culture, says Lovich.In contrast, ineffective middle managers — whether due to inexperience, poor job fit, vague guidance from their own bosses or another reason — can weaken performance and morale. Only 51% of newer managers with less than three years of experience feel completely prepared to lead others, according to Insperity's data. And only 20% of employees say their managers exceed their expectations, according to a recent Insperity survey of 1,000 U.S. executives, managers and frontline employees.One potential solution, suggests Withinton: Companies could invest in management training and upskilling, rather than using layoffs as a short-term fix. Upskilling isn't free, of course. But spending about $1,000 per employee to train and develop your talent may have better long-term outcomes, Withinton says, considering turnover costs and lost employee trust and morale — especially for companies that eventually rehire after layoffs anyway. Besides, effective management is about more than money, says Withinton. Some workers find that their work is more difficult when their immediate manager is cut. In Korn Ferry's report, 37% of survey respondents said that not having that middle management role left them feeling directionless.\"I would really encourage people to think about managers not as an expense or an administrative or bureaucratic layer, but an agent for change,\" she says. As organizations rethink their strategies and workflow to be more AI-forward, managers can help guide their teams to use the technology effectively, instead of fear it. \"[Especially] in a time where things are changing week to week, and we're all just going to be scrambling to keep up for a while as this new [AI-driven] world unfolds.\"How to use managers to their full potentialManagers provide the most value when they're keeping their teams accountable and helping workers feel motivated and supported, says Lovich — not necessarily when they're handling administrative tasks like coordinating meetings or tracking employees.The emotional element of management is particularly important in the age of AI, she notes. The tech can and should be used to augment managers' abilities to complete administrative tasks, but can't authentically congratulate an employee on a job well done or notice that they're a little down and not themselves on a given day, Lovich says.Manager training should emphasize skills like fostering interpersonal relationships, effective communication, decision making and accountability, conflict resolution and building trust within teams, according to Insperity performance consultant Chris Brennan.Organizations that use their managers to their full potential reap significant benefits, Insperity's survey found: Their employees are five times more likely to report a healthy workplace culture and four times more likely to understand and align with company goals. What's more, companies with high-performing managers tend to yield higher shareholder returns than their counterparts, according to a June 2023 report from McKinsey and Company. Those advantages will be especially important as organizations start to integrate artificial intelligence into their workflows, Withinton says.\"Before we all leap to 'AI is going to make the role of manager either obsolete or much more reduced,' you actually have to deploy AI and make it work for your company,\" Withinton says. \"And the managers are the people who are going to be able to really make sure that it's being used in the appropriate way day to day. There is no other way around that.\"Still, a looming question remains: By helping facilitate the transition to AI, are today's managers positioning themselves to be increasingly obsolete tomorrow?

    "body": "The growing wealth and enhanced spending power of the over-50s is poised to accelerate a range of investment opportunities across multiple sectors in the U.K., according to investors.Market pros say this age group — dubbed the \"Grey Pound\" or \"Silver Spenders\" — is gaining greater control over its assets. With greater wealth and more discretionary income, a larger chunk of this demographic is increasingly seen as the new \"idle rich.\"Dan Coatsworth, head of markets at AJ Bell, said that the over-50s were an increasingly influential demographic within the consumer space.\"Those still working might be well advanced in their career, paid off their mortgage, and have lots of disposable cash. They might have worked hard for decades and feel like they deserve to splash the cash,\" Coatsworth told CNBC.\"Those in retirement might be in the generation that received generous defined benefit pension schemes and collect a tidy sum to fund an extravagant lifestyle,\" he added.Coatsworth said the group wants to protect as much of their wealth as they can from taxation, which means seeking advice on tax, investments, and general financial planning.Compounding assetsAlyx Wood, co-founder and chief investment officer at Kernow Asset Management, said there was a clear subset of winners and losers within this cohort.Day-to-day life for \"a lot of\" them is still \"quite tough and normal,\" but there are others who are \"just absolutely nailing it in terms of compounding their assets,\" he said.This latter wealthier segment is developing an appetite for luxury goods \"that they've never had before,\" as well as for \"higher-end\" wealth management and insurance services.These customers are increasingly seeking out \"content, story, getting involved, a purpose\" that extends beyond traditional passive returns, Wood added.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconHiscox.He highlighted names like insurance group Hiscox and privately-owned wealth managers Evelyn Partners as potential winners as older consumers turn to certain premium wealth management and insurance products.\"The banks are trying to buy back into the wealth management industry,\" said Wood, pointing to the reported interest in Evelyn Partners from NatWest Group and Barclays as private equity owners Permira and Warburg Pincus seek to exit. \"I expect you'll see a few of those.\"Wood, a contrarian stock picker whose hedge fund specializes in U.K. equities, last month outlined a major position on Saga plc at the annual Sohn London investment conference, which he said was also partly a wager on the strength of the \"Silver Pound.\"He said people living their \"Saga years,\" a reference to the travel and insurance brand that focuses on the over-50s, will account for about 60% of all U.K. consumer spending by 2030.Saga — which makes up about 10% of Kernow's portfolio — is a \"materially undervalued\" business, whose share price could surge over 400% in the next few years, Wood added.'The list goes on'Wood said that Pets At Home, the London-listed specialist retailer of pet food, toys, and accessories, was another name facing near-term pressures that could ultimately emerge as a beneficiary of the trend, as older consumers buy more for their pets and spend less on their children.\"Experiences and material goods will rank highly on their list of places to spend money – such as holidays, nice meals, fancy cars, home renovations, beauty products, wellness,\" Coatsworth said of the cohort. \"The list goes on.\"Stock Chart IconStock chart iconPets At Home.Coatsworth also said that the healthcare sector was a likely winner, as an ageing population will mean rising demand for medicine and treatment.\"Private care homes, retirement villages and property investors with medical providers as tenants are among the winners from this trend,\" Coatsworth told CNBC via email.",

    "body": "The logo of Meta is seen at the Viva Technology conference dedicated to innovation and startups at Porte de Versailles exhibition center in Paris, France, on June 11, 2025.Gonzalo Fuentes | ReutersMeta Platforms said Tuesday that it has acquired Manus, a Singapore-based developer of general-purpose AI agents, as the tech giant continues its massive investments into artificial intelligence. Manus, founded in China before relocating to Singapore, launched its first general AI agent earlier this year, which can execute complex tasks such as market research, coding, and data analysis. The company claimed it had achieved an annualized average revenue of more than $100 million just eight months after launch, while its revenue run rate exceeded $125 million.Meta said in a statement that its acquisition was aimed at accelerating AI innovation for businesses and integrating advanced automation into its consumer and enterprise products, including its Meta AI assistant.\"Manus is already serving the daily needs of millions of users and businesses worldwide ... We plan to scale this service to many more businesses,\" Meta said.The company also said it will take steps to wind down Manus AI's remaining business operations in China and that \"there will be no continuing Chinese ownership interests\" after the transaction.According to the firms, Manus will continue operating its subscription service without disruption. While further terms of the acquisition were not disclosed, the Wall Street Journal reported that the deal closed at an amount over $2 billion, according to sources familiar with the acquisition. The start-up was seeking a fresh round of fundraising at a $2 billion valuation when it was approached by Meta, the report added.Manus began as a product of Chinese start-up Butterfly Effect, also known as Monica.Im, before growing into a separate entity. It emerged as a notable AI player earlier this year after claiming its chatbot offered superior performance to OpenAI's Deep Research agent.The company raised $75 million in a Series B funding round led by U.S. venture firm Benchmark in April, and is backed by Tencent and private equity firm HongShan Capital Group (HSG), formerly known as Sequoia, according to data from market research firm Tracxn.The start-up reportedly laid off most of its staff in Beijing in July before moving its headquarters to Singapore in June as it looked towards global expansion.\"Joining Meta allows us to build on a stronger, more sustainable foundation without changing how Manus works or how decisions are made,\" Xiao Hong, CEO of Manus, said in a company release. The firm also announced a strategic partnership with Alibaba's Qwen AI team in March, highlighting its existing ties to Chinese tech companies.Aggressive AI expansionMeta's acquisition of Manus fits into its broader AI strategy of scooping up specialized AI start-ups to acquire talent and fast-track its broader AI business, including the development of its open-source Llama large language models.In June, for example, Meta invested $14.3 billion in AI start-up Scale AI, in a deal that brought its founder and CEO, Alexandr Wang, onto Meta's AI leadership team.Meanwhile, Meta acquired AI-wearables start-up Limitless earlier this month as the company looks to grow its AI device business.In the case of Manus, the firm's AI agent tools have drawn interest from major tech companies. In October, Microsoft began testing Manus in Windows 11 PCs, allowing users to create websites from local files. To date, Manus claimed to have processed more than 147 trillion \"tokens\" of text and data, and supported over 80 million virtual computers. It offers both free and paid subscription tiers.Meta said Manus employees will join its teams as the company continues to aggressively poach AI talent from start-ups and major rivals, including OpenAI and Google. ",

(photo by Andrew Aitchison / In pictures via Getty Images)Andrew Aitchison | In Pictures | Getty ImagesBritish renewable energy startup Octopus Energy is set to spin out its AI tech unit Kraken Technologies, setting the stage for a potential public listing.Origin Energy, which holds a major stake in Octopus, said in a statement late on Monday that Octopus had raised $1 billion in its first standalone funding round, valuing the business at $8.65 billion. The funding round paves the way for the spinoff, with Octopus targeting a separation by mid-2026, Origin said.The statement said \"a major Kraken customer,\" which it did not name, and Daniel Sundheim's hedge fund D1 Capital Partners were involved in the investment round. Origin will also invest $140 million as part of the process. \"In signing this major new customer, Kraken is rapidly closing in on its 100 million customer account target well ahead of plan,\" said Origin CEO Frank Calabria.Octopus Energy will retain a 13.7% stake in Kraken following the spin-out, while Origin's interest in Kraken remains at 22.7%.\"We believe these transactions put Octopus and Kraken in a strong position to unlock their next phase of growth, underpinned by the appropriate capital structure,\" Calabria added.Kraken supplies energy software to utility companies, including EDF and E.ON. Its contracted annual recurring revenue more than doubled in the last 18 months, according to Origin Energy.Earlier this year, Kraken CEO Amir Orad told CNBC's \"Squawk Box Europe\" that the company has a \"very strong investor base\" that focuses on energy and utilities. watch nowKraken has benefited from being owned by Octopus, as a growing number of energy companies licensed its technology, turning the company into what Orad described as \"the modern operating system for utilities.\"When asked about a public listing in September, Orad told CNBC that the \"opportunity is significant,\" but that Kraken needed to focus on being a pure software company.\"With that, we expect, over time, to get more pure software long-term, late-stage investors. Today, we have a very strong investor base that focuses on energy and on utilities. Over the years... we expect that to evolve to be more software focused, given the [separation],'\" he said.— CNBC's Domi Suskova contributed to this report.",

    "body": "watch nowAt a challenging time for the restaurant industry, major chains like Chipotle and Cava are putting money behind automated makelines from startup Hyphen.The San Jose, California-based company aims to help restaurants achieve two key goals in a hyper-competitive environment: speedy throughput and good customer service. The technology makes for a less chaotic and more \"elegant experience\" for workers and guests alike, co-founder and CEO Stephen Klein told CNBC in an interview. \"We're probably making a bowl every 10 to 15 seconds. At peak throughput, we have more capacity usually than they do demand, especially ... for lunch and dinner rushes,\" Klein said.That efficiency has brought increased interest across the industry. In August 2025, Hyphen closed a Series B round of financing that included up to $10 million from Cava. Chipotle said it has invested a total of $25 million into Hyphen via its Cultivate Next venture fund through the third quarter of 2025. The $25 million Series B round will help Hyphen scale its production and rollout across restaurants in the U.S. Its production will ramp with Re:Build Manufacturing, a company based in Kalamazoo, Michigan. Chipotle's Hyphen makeline is in San Jose for modification after an in-restaurant test. Cava will test and pilot its tech for a second makeline to serve digital and takeout orders in the back of its kitchen in the future.A finished burrito bowl assembled by Chipotle and Hyphen's automation technology.Source: Chipotle Mexican GrillHyphen's technology solves for both a speed and labor issue, helping to automate part of the service process that can be repetitive and challenging to fill. \"You can have, somebody is selling ingredients on top, while the rest of this stuff is happening underneath,\" he said of the makeline, which relies on a series of robotic hands to prep salads and bowls under a long table, out of public view, sending them down the row.The makelines cost between $50,000 and $100,000 to purchase, and restaurant customers are often getting a return on investment in under a year, Klein said. They operate 95% of the time, but during the rare moments they're down, workers can jump in to complete orders, the way an escalator would turn into stairs, he said.Another key feature is cutting down on food waste. The technology tracks ingredients \"down to the gram,\" Klein said.\"We're perfectly portioning every ingredient, we're able to help them save on food costs, or at least reduce food costs in some way,\" he said. The idea of the company began when Klein and his co-founder Daniel Fukuba built a fully robotic food truck, which launched in Los Angeles three months before the pandemic started. They changed gears to launch Hyphen soon after that.\"When the pandemic happened, we kind of just had to share that into another direction. We had luckily been talking to other restaurant partners about licensing our technology for them, and we decided ... it just made a lot more sense to help restaurants that are already around today,\" Klein said.Technology innovation will likely continue to be a key trend in the restaurant sector after a brutal year for many of the industry's leaders. Shares of Cava and Chipotle are down nearly 50% and 40% year-to-date, respectively, after pullbacks from key demographics including younger consumers. Sweetgreen, another competitor in the healthy salad and bowl space, is down nearly 80% on the year. Sweetgreen sold its robotics unit, Spyce, to mealtime platform Wonder earlier this year for $186.4 million. Sweetgreen had acquired Spyce to build its automated Infinite Kitchens, and it will continue to use the technology.Klein said Hyphen is talking to major brands and food service providers for college campuses and office parks as it looks to not only evolve the makeline, but also provide data that comes from the food prep and distribution. The company aims to develop more software in the future, including tools for food prep scheduling to be used in the back of the house. One area that's not on the menu, at least for now, is the fast food sector.\"We're really trying to help people that have really a high mix or high customization in terms of what their guests are ordering, as well as high volume. So that's kind of our strike zone,\" he said. watch now",

    "body": "Before moving to New York City in 2013, Cintia Diaz didn't have any professional culinary experience on her resume. At home in the Dominican Republic, she'd cooked for her family, but she was a stranger to the restaurant business.In New York, that quickly changed. Diaz took on various restaurant roles over the years, from server and bartender to maître d' and host.\"I wanted to learn more about every single role in the industry,\" she tells CNBC Make It.Today, the 33-year-old has experience from two more roles under her belt; she's now a private chef and culinary educator.Cintia Diaz, a private chef living in New York City, offers meal prep and private dinner services.Valentina Duarte | CNBC Make ItIn 2025, she made roughly $66,220 in gross income. \"At the moment, my business is in a very good place, and I'm happy where it's heading,\" she says.From fine dining to home kitchensFollowing her string of restaurant jobs in her first few years in New York, Diaz pivoted into fine dining around 2017 and subsequently pursued a bachelor's degree in hospitality management.Her goal at the time was to one day work in leadership, managing restaurants. But after a few years in the restaurant business, she wanted a healthier work-life balance and felt being a private chef would offer her that. To become one, she went back to school for an associate's degree in culinary arts to get hands-on training in the kitchen.\"Being a chef allows you to explore what balanced meals are, how to eat healthier, how to share the knowledge with others,\" Diaz says. \"I've always been very curious about how the body reacts with the different meals and how we feed the body. Food is medicine.\"Cintia Diaz left the restaurant industry to become a private chef, which she says gives her greater work-life balance.Valentina Duarte | CNBC Make ItDiaz began working as a private chef in 2021. She offers meal prep services as well as private dinners. Today, she averages four to five meal prep clients per week and two to three private dinners per month, she says. She gets clients from referrals and booking platforms like Solette and Take a Chef.Besides being a private chef, Diaz also teaches cooking classes for children at local schools through a culinary education organization. It comes naturally to her, she notes, as her parents are both teachers.\"I like working with the kids; I like to teach,\" she says. \"I grew up around that, and that's something that I really enjoy.\"Besides being a private chef, Cintia Diaz also teaches culinary classes for kids.Valentina Duarte | CNBC Make It'I really enjoy the freedom'For a meal prep client, Diaz will usually dish up four to five days' worth of food at a time. She works with each client to create a menu and decide how many meals and which meals of the day to prepare.\"My focus is based on what the client needs, the requirements, the preferences, the culture, the lifestyle,\" she says. \"Different clients have different preferences and needs with their family.\"Diaz either orders groceries online ahead of her visit to the client's home or heads to the supermarket before cooking. After preparing, labeling and storing the meals, she cleans the kitchen and stays in touch with them until her next service.Cintia Diaz either goes grocery shopping before a service at a client's home or orders groceries delivered in advance of her visit.Valentina Duarte | CNBC Make ItOne perk of being a private chef is having \"more direct contact with the person that I'm cooking for,\" Diaz says. Another is flexibility: When she worked in restaurants, she was juggling two to three jobs alongside her college classes; school and work together took 50 to 60 hours a week then, she estimates. Today, Diaz says she works 20 to 25 hours a week.\"I really enjoy the freedom of being able to build my own lifestyle, my own schedule and being able to be creative in my workplace,\" she says. \"There are weeks or months that I decide to have an easier schedule. There are other times that I decided to work a little bit more.\"But, there can be a \"lack of consistency\" in being a private chef.\"Sometimes there are weeks that you can have a full week, but maybe the following week is going to be a little bit slower,\" Diaz says.'The same income that I would have working in a restaurant'Diaz's meal prep pricing ranges from $250 to $450 per service, excluding groceries, depending on how much food she's preparing and for how many people, as well as how labor-intensive the menu is. For private dinners, she charges between $110 and $300. Diaz makes between $90 to $275 per culinary class.Because she primarily uses clients' kitchen supplies, her main business expenses are her $56 monthly phone bill and $34 weekly public transit card.\"I think you can live comfortably in New York City with the amount of money that I make as a private chef,\" she says.Cintia Diaz says she makes \"the same income\" she would have working in a restaurant while working much less, around 20 to 25 hours a week.Valentina Duarte | CNBC Make ItDiaz lives with her boyfriend and says splitting living expenses helps stretch her money further.\"I don't think it's in my plans to work as a restaurant chef,\" she says. \"I have the flexibility in my schedule and the freedom to work in the ranges that I want with the hours that I want with the same income that I would have working in a restaurant.\"At home in her own kitchen, Diaz still cooks and meal preps for her boyfriend and herself on the weekends, usually making Dominican food. Doing it for work too hasn't taken away her love of cooking.\"It's like my mini science project where I can tweak things, create things, and if it doesn't work, I just try it again until it works,\" she says. \"It's very beautiful that you're creating something with your own hands, and the results are something that you can really enjoy.\"Want to give your kids the ultimate advantage?

With an expected reacceleration of growth in many countries in 2026, precious metals and their safe-haven status might lose some of their shine.\"We're seeing commodities as one of the top performers for next year ... but the source of the performance is more cyclical commodities than defensive precious metals,\" Ielpo told \"Squawk Box Europe\" on Tuesday.watch nowGold futures also recovered from a sharp sell-off on Monday, and last traded 1.2% higher at $4,394.30 an ounce.Meanwhile, copper futures were last seen up 1.9% to $5.673 an ounce.Precious metals had a stellar year, driven by multiple factors. As safe-haven assets, gold and silver benefited from increased geopolitical tensions. They're also viewed as hedges against inflation. A weaker U.S. dollar also makes the metals cheaper and more attractive for foreign buyers as well. Expected interest rate cuts and concerns over supply constraints have also driven up prices. Over the weekend, Tesla CEO Elon Musk warned that China's export restrictions on silver, due to take effect on Jan. 1, were \"not good.\" \"Silver is needed in many industrial processes,\" Musk wrote on X, possibly prompting prices to rise further.Silver is commonly used in electronics, including solar power panels, data centers, and electric vehicles.— CNBC's Sarah Min contributed to this report.",

In New York, copper prices have soared more than 40% since the start of 2025, also putting it on track for its biggest annual jump since 2009, when the contract rose 137.3%. Demand for copper is widely considered a proxy for economic health. The base metal is critically important to the energy transition ecosystem and is integral to the manufacturing of electric vehicles, power grids and wind turbines.Indeed, electrification, grid expansion and data center build-outs all require large amounts of copper for wiring, power transmission and cooling infrastructure. watch nowIan Roper, commodity strategist at Astris Advisory Japan KK, singled out a global boom in AI demand as the latest driver for copper prices, with \"very tight\" markets likely to mean the red metal could rally even further next year.\"The story for copper of the last few years has been green energy, right? Even though China has had a huge property downturn [and] that's hit things like steel demand, iron ore prices, it's not really affected copper so much,\" Roper told CNBC's Dan Murphy on Dec. 23.\"Copper has been a big beneficiary of the build-out of renewable energy, EVs, and now, of course, data centers is the big growth story,\" he added. AI and defenseAnalysts at JPMorgan said in a research note published in late November that LME copper prices could have further room to run next year, predicting an average of $12,500 per metric ton in the second quarter.The Wall Street bank said it expects copper to average $12,075 through 2026, citing data center demand growth as an \"extremely topical\" upside risk.\"All in all, we think these unique dynamics of disjointed inventory and acute supply disruptions tightening the copper market add up to a bullish set up for copper, and are enough to push prices above $12,000/mt in the first half of 2026,\" Gregory Shearer, head of base and precious metals strategy at JPMorgan, said in the note.  Coils, coiled copper wires, lie on pallets in the wire plant (coiler) at Aurubis AG. After a casting and rolling process, hot copper wire is wound through the coiler into a coil weighing up to five tons and measuring around twelve kilometers in length.Picture Alliance | Picture Alliance | Getty ImagesNot everyone is as bullish on the copper price outlook, however.  Analysts at Goldman Sachs Research expect copper prices to decline from their recent record highs, even as growing demand for the metal gradually pushes up prices in the longer term.  In a research note published on Dec. 11, analysts at Goldman Sachs Research said LME copper prices were poised to remain in a range of $10,000 to $11,000 as robust global demand growth from the grid and power infrastructure sector, \"backed by investment in strategic sectors such as AI and defence,\" keeps prices from dipping below $10,000.The analysts said they expect LME copper prices to average $10,710 in the first half of 2026. Looking much further ahead, they projected LME copper prices to climb to $15,000 in 2035, noting that this is above the consensus of industry analysts.",

    "body": "WASHINGTON – The Federal Reserve on Tuesday released minutes from its highly divisive meeting earlier this month, which concluded with a vote to lower interest rates again that appeared to be an even closer call than the final vote indicated.Officials expressed a variety of opinions during the Dec. 9-10 meeting, according to the summary provided a day ahead of its customary release due to the New Year's holiday.Ultimately, the Federal Open Market Committee approved a quarter percentage point cut by a 9-3 vote, the most dissents since 2019 as officials debated over the need to support the labor market against concerns about inflation. The move lowered the key funds rate to a range of 3.5%-3.75%.\"Most participants judged that further downward adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate would likely be appropriate if inflation declined over time as expected,\" the document said.With that, though, came misgivings over how aggressive the FOMC should be in the future.\"With respect to the extent and timing of additional adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, some participants suggested that, under their economic outlooks, it would likely be appropriate to keep the target range unchanged for some time after a lowering of the range at this meeting,\" the minutes said.Officials expressed confidence that the economy would continue to expand around a \"moderate\" pace, while they saw downside risks to employment and upside risks to inflation. The extent of the two dynamics divided FOMC policymakers, with indications that the vote could have gone either way despite the six-vote victory for the cut.\"A few of those who supported lowering the policy rate at this meeting indicated that the decision was finely balanced or that they could have supported keeping the target range unchanged,\" the minutes said.Stocks held slightly negative following the release. Traders raised bets a bit that the Fed would cut again in April.The vote also came with a quarterly update of the committee's Summary of Economic Projections, including the closely watched \"dot plot\" grid of individual officials' rate expectations.The 19 officials at the December meeting – 12 vote on rates – indicated the likelihood of another cut in 2026 then one more in 2027. That would take the funds rate down to near 3%, a level officials consider as neutral in that it neither restricts nor pushes economic growth.The faction favoring keeping the rate steady \"expressed concern that progress toward the Committee's 2 percent inflation objective had stalled in 2025 or indicated that they needed to have more confidence that inflation was being brought down sustainably to the Committee's objective.\"Officials said President Donald Trump's tariffs were boosting inflation, but they also largely agreed that the impact would be temporary and likely abate into 2026.Since the vote, economic reports have pointed to a labor market where hiring is still slow but layoffs have not accelerated. On the prices side, inflation has been slowly easing but remains a distance away from the Fed's 2% target.At the same time, the broader economy continues to perform well. Gross domestic product soared in the third quarter, rising at a 4.3% annualized pace that was well ahead of estimates and a half percentage point better than the strong second quarter.However, most of the data carries a significant caveat: Reports are still trailing as government agencies round up data from the dark period during the government shutdown. Even the reports coming in that are more current, at least from official sources, are being weighed with caution due the data gaps.Consequently, markets largely expect the FOMC to stay put over the next few meetings as policymakers weigh incoming data. The holiday season was a quiet one for Fed official commentary and the few comments out there show mostly caution heading into the new year.The committee's complexion also is about to change, with four new regional presidents rotating into voting roles. They will be Cleveland President Beth Hammack, who has expressed opposition not only to additional cuts but also previous ones; Philadelphia President Anna Paulson, who has joined FOMC doves in expressing concern about inflation; Dallas President Lorie Logan, who has voiced concerns about cutting; and Minneapolis President Neel Kashkari, who said he wouldn't have voted for the October cut.Also at the meeting, the committee voted to resume its bond-buying program. Under the new setup, the Fed will be acquiring short-term Treasury bills in an effort to calm pressures in short-term funding markets.The central bank initiated the program by buying $40 billion a month in bills, staying around that level for several months before downshifting. A prior effort to reduce the balance sheet saw the Fed cut its holdings by about $2.3 trillion to its current $6.6 trillion.The minutes noted that unless the buying program, known in markets as quantitative easing, was restarted, it could result in a \"significant declines in reserves\" that would fall below the Fed's \"ample\" regime for the banking system.Correction: The vote came with a quarterly update of the committee's Summary of Economic Projections. An earlier version misstated the name of the forecast.",

The seized tanker had been sanctioned by the U.S. for years and transported oil from Iran and Venezuela, according to a post from Attorney General Pam Bondi.And at the meeting on Monday with Netanyahu, Trump also confirmed an attack on an alleged drug loading facility on Venezuelan soil.

    "body": "Mary Barra, CEO of General Motors, attends the annual Allen and Co. Sun Valley Media and Technology Conference at the Sun Valley Resort in Sun Valley, Idaho, on July 8, 2025.David A. Grogan | CNBCDETROIT — General Motors is on pace to be the top U.S.-traded automaker stock of 2025, as shares of GM are having their best year since the Detroit company's reemergence from bankruptcy in 2009.GM stock is up over 55% to a record of more than $80 per share, as of Friday's close, topping the company's previous annual increase of 48.3% last year. That includes a nearly 13% rise so far in December, adding to five consecutive months of share gains, according to FactSet.Several factors have been driving the share increase. But GM CEO Mary Barra and other executives have contended for years that the automaker's stock has been significantly undervalued given its consistent earnings performance.\"Great vehicles, innovative technology, a rewarding customer experience, along with strong financial results, will continue to set GM apart in an increasingly competitive landscape,\" Barra said during the company's last quarterly earnings call in October.Amid the stock's run-up, Barra has significantly cut her position in the company. She has exercised options or sold roughly 1.8 million shares this year, valued at more than $73 million, according to public filings confirmed by GM. As of the last public filing in September, Barra still owned more than 433,500 shares valued at over $35 million, with much of her annual awards granted in options and stock.GM's stock performance compares with a 17% yearly increase for Tesla as of Friday's close, a 34% jump for Ford Motor and a 15% loss for Chrysler parent Stellantis. Other U.S.-traded automakers such as Honda Motor and Toyota Motor have had smaller annual gains.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconAuto stocksGM 's most recent quarterly earnings were a major catalyst for Wall Street analyst bullishness that led to reratings and price target increases after the third quarter.The automaker's quarterly adjusted earnings per share have topped Wall Street estimates every quarter except the second quarter of 2022 over the past five years, according to average expectations of analysts compiled by FactSet. Wall Street analysts overall have cited GM's cash generation, earnings resilience and track record in delivering shareholder returns, including stock buybacks, as reasons for their optimism. The automaker also is expected to greatly benefit from regulation changes under the Trump administration, despite ongoing tariffs. UBS recently increased its 12-month price target on GM stock by 14% to $97 per share, while naming the company its top autos pick heading into 2026. Morgan Stanley earlier this month also upgraded GM to overweight, with a $90 per share price target.\"In our view, General Motors leads the D3 in the North America and Global market with steady unit sales growth, [average transaction price] growth, disciplined incentive spend, and inventory management. This has resulted in better [earnings before interest and taxes] margin and return metrics than peers,\" Morgan Stanley analyst Andrew Percoco said in a Dec. 7 investor note.Read moreGM stock has cumulatively been in the black on a weekly basis since June. The largest weekly gain of 19.3% occurred when the automaker reported its third-quarter earnings on Oct. 21. Those results beat Wall Street's expectations and the company raised its annual guidance, adding that next year's earnings are expected to be better than 2025's.GM stock's has also seen a boost from some external factors. The Trump administration has loosened U.S. fuel economy and emissions standards, removed related penalties that were imposed under the Biden administration, and renegotiated its trade deal with South Korea, a major manufacturing hub for GM. Meanwhile, the industry has been seeing a slowdown in less profitable EV sales.\"GM is effectively a regional (NA) [automaker] and we believe they are well positioned to benefit from the relaxed US regulatory environment (emissions and fuel economy),\" UBS analyst Joseph Spak said in a Dec. 15 investor note raising the per share price.GM CFO Paul Jacobson earlier this month said the company will continue stock buybacks.\"As long as the stock remains as undervalued as it is, the priority is to buy back shares. And I think you'll continue to see that from us going forward,\" he said during a UBS investor conference.GM is rated overweight with an $80.86 target price, according to analyst averages compiled by FactSet.— CNBC's Michael Bloom contributed to this report.Correction: Lucid shares are down for the year.

    "body": "As the restaurant industry endured another difficult year, many chains opted to close underperforming locations as they try to turn around their businesses.Inflation-weary consumers have pulled back their restaurant spending, choosing to eat at home or chasing deals when they go out for a meal. While some restaurants have won over reluctant diners, the industry has largely struggled with the sales slump. Traffic to restaurants open at least a year fell every month in 2025, excluding only July, according to Black Box Intelligence. In years past, restaurant closures have been more concentrated across casual-dining chains, which lost customers to fast-casual competitors like Chipotle. But this year, chains across the industry announced plans to shutter at least hundreds of locations.In such a tough environment, some restaurant companies even filed for bankruptcy protection. Hooters, Pinstripes and On the Border were some of the notable names that landed in bankruptcy court this year.Here are the chains that announced closures in 2025:StarbucksA Starbucks coffee cup sits on a table inside a Starbucks in New York on Dec. 2, 2025.Spencer Platt | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesIn September, the coffee giant announced a $1 billion restructuring plan that included closing roughly 500 of its North American locations. The closures even extended to shuttering its upscale Reserve Roastery cafe in Seattle, the company's hometown.Starbucks' announcement followed CEO Brian Niccol's one-year anniversary at the helm of the company. Under his leadership, Starbucks is trying to reverse a sales slump in the U.S., its biggest market. Executives plan to share more details about the turnaround at the company's upcoming investor day in late January in New York. Wendy'sA Wendy's restaurant sign in Austin, Texas, Nov. 10, 2025.Brandon Bell | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesIn November, Wendy's announced that it would undergo a strategic review of its restaurant footprint and begin closing underperforming locations that quarter. While the company did not announce a specific number of closures, interim CEO and CFO Ken Cook told analysts that the company could shutter a \"mid-single digit percentage\" of its U.S. restaurants shuttering, which would mean hundreds of the burger chain's locations.The closures are one phase of Wendy's \"Project Fresh\" turnaround plan. The company has reported same-store sales declines even as rivals McDonald's and Burger King see higher demand for their Big Macs and Whoppers.In 2024, Wendy's shuttered about 140 locations.Denny'sA view of a Denny's restaurant in Hayward, California, Feb. 14, 2025.Justin Sullivan | Getty ImagesIn February, Denny's said it planned to close between 70 and 90 restaurants in 2025. In recent months, the diner chain's sales sunk as customers opted to visit cheaper fast-food restaurants for breakfast. The shift in behavior led the company to shutter underperforming locations and attempt to improve the rest of its restaurant footprint.In November, the chain announced it had sold itself for $620 million to Yadav Enterprises, TriArtisan Capital Advisors and Treville Capital Group. The deal is expected to close in the first quarter of 2026, pending regulatory approval.Jack in the BoxGeri Lavrov | Getty ImagesIn April, Jack in the Box said it would close between 150 and 200 restaurants as part of its \"Jack on Track\" strategy to improve its financial performance. By the end of its fiscal 2025 on Sept. 28, the chain had permanently shuttered 86 restaurants. Bahama BreezeIn May, Bahama Breeze parent company Darden Restaurants closed 15 of the chain's locations, which represents roughly a third of its overall footprint. Following the closures, executives decided that the Caribbean-inspired chain was not a strategic priority for Darden, so the company is exploring strategic alternatives for the brand. Options include selling the chain outright or converting its restaurants into other Darden brands, like Olive Garden. Darden expects to make a decision on Bahama Breeze by the end of its fiscal 2026, which concludes in May.Hardee'sDozens of Hardee's locations will close by end of the year after the franchisor sued ARC Burger, one of its largest franchisees. Hardee's alleges that the operator fell behind on payments like royalties, rent and taxes.

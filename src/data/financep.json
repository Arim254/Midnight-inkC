    "body": "In 2019, Chanel Rivers took a trip to London that would change the entire trajectory of her life.Born and raised in New York, Rivers, now 35, says she was tired of the dating scene and worrying about her safety in the Big Apple. She booked a trip to London with a friend and realized how comfortable she felt walking around the city, something she no longer felt in New York.\"I remember just walking around London and being like, 'I feel like this is where I'm supposed to be.' It was a feeling that came over me,\" Rivers says. \"In London, I just feel like my anxiety has lessened a lot, which is great.\"Shortly after Rivers got back to New York, she started figuring out how to return to London permanently, but the Covid-19 pandemic brought her plans to a complete halt. During the pandemic, Rivers met her now fiancé, Martin, an architect from Canada who was living and working in New York.Rivers was born and raised in New York.Chanel RiversAfter four and a half years of dating, Rivers brought up moving to London again to her fiancé. She admits that the feeling of wanting to move didn't go away, and she didn't see herself being in New York long-term anymore.\"I considered Canada, and we did look at Vancouver, but it was not city enough for me. Being from New York, I needed a big city. London was always the plan for me in my heart,\" she says.Around the same time that Rivers brought up getting the move to London going, her fiancé's job offered him a position in their office there. It was something she says was \"very serendipitous but meant to be.\"Since Martin was already a U.K. citizen, Rivers only needed to apply for a partner visa, which was approved in March 2024.Chanel is part of small but growing trend of Americans relocating to the U.K. More than 6,000 U.S. citizens applied to either become British subjects or to live and work in the country indefinitely from March 2024 to March 2025, the most since the U.K.'s Home Office began keeping records in 2004, according to The Guardian.Hello, LondonIn October 2024, the couple moved into a two-bedroom, one-bathroom apartment with a private garden in West London without ever seeing it in person. The rent was 2,400 pounds or USD $3,159 when they first moved in and has since increased to 2,515.20 pounds or $3,311, according to documents reviewed by CNBC Make It.The apartment was unfurnished, in a townhouse rather than a larger building, and didn't have a doorman, unlike the modern one they lived in back in New York City. The couple didn't ship any of their furniture over because it was too expensive. The first night they spent in the apartment, they slept in sleeping bags on the floor and used their suitcases as a dining table.\"We wanted something with character. We told ourselves we wanted something different when we moved here and we wanted something that felt very London so that we had a different living experience than we did in the U.S.,\" Rivers says.Rivers, her fiancé and their dog moved to London in October 2024.Chanel RiversRivers was able to keep her $120,000 a year job in event planning and marketing through the end of 2024.After that, she started looking for a position in London, which she says helped her explore the city as she traveled for interviews and worked out of local coffee shops. Rivers says she never had homesickness or regretted the move, but she admits that she was still nervous about being in a new city. \"I was so intimidated by London because it's so big and I was kind of scared to go out on my own. I don't know what happened to that brave girl from 2019, but I guess everything just felt so real now, and it was hitting me,\" she adds.One year later and the cost of living in LondonNow that Rivers and her fiancé have lived in London for a little over a year, they have settled in nicely, she says. Rivers found a London-based job working as an event planner. Rivers did not want to disclose her salary, but says that although she did take a pay cut, she's happy with it and spends less money than she did while living in New York. \"I've found that I generally spend less now, mostly because I'm not socializing as much as I did in New York. In London, life is a bit quieter but in a good way,\" she says. \"I still make time to see new friends and meet new people but I go out less. Plus, since I earn less here, I'm more mindful about where my money goes.\"Rivers and her fiancé also split their expenses proportionally based on their incomes. \"My fiancé makes the equivalent of what he made in the U.S., so he's kind of carrying the team right now, which is great,\" she adds.Rivers and her fiancé moved into an apartment without seeing it in person.Chanel RiversRivers' share of the monthly living expenses breakdown is as follows, according to documents reviewed by CNBC Make It:Rent = 1,215 pounds or $1,599Cellphone = 49.70 pounds or $65Internet/Wi-Fi = 20 pounds or $26Water = 59.78 pounds or $79Electricity = 121 pounds or $159Groceries = 300 pounds or $395Transportation = 115 pounds or $151Amazon Prime = 8.99 pounds or $12Pet insurance = 25.21 pounds or $33Apple TV = $12.99Rivers' biggest monthly expenses are rent, groceries and electricity, she says. She commutes to the office three times a week and tends to buy lunch on those days. Since moving to London, Rivers and her fiancé say they have also been able to take advantage of the city's location by taking local day trips on the train and traveling to Ireland and Mallorca. \"It's really nice to have easier access to traveling. I feel like in the U.S., you go on a trip once a year and that's it. It's nice that we can hop on a train and go to Paris for a night or hop on a plane and go to Spain,\" she says. \"The traveling is also a big part of why we wanted to move. Despite it taking a while to get settled, Rivers says she feels they made the right decision.\"I've only felt like this is the right path and where I'm supposed to be. Even the mundane things I do here excite me,\" she says. \"I feel like I'm probably in a honeymoon phase but I feel every day that I made the right choice. I don't think I see myself living in the U.S. now that I know what it's like to live a lifestyle outside of that.\"Rivers says she doesn't see herself moving back to the U.S.Chanel RiversRivers says moving back to the U.S. probably isn't in the cards for her, but she could eventually get on board with moving to Canada after living out her London dream for a few more years. \"Canada wasn't as exciting for where I'm at in life right now. I wanted something a little bit more exciting, like New York, but different. I think when I get older, if we were to move back and we wanted to be closer to family, then Canada would be the place we move to,\" she says.Conversions from British Pounds to USD were done using the OANDA conversion rate of 0.76 pounds to $1 USD on Nov. 11, 2025.

    "body": "At 88 years old, renowned actor Morgan Freeman is still starring in movies and using his distinctive voice to narrate films. His acting career spans six decades, and he isn't looking to retire, according to AARP.Freeman told the nonprofit that he plans to \"keep moving.\" And he pairs that sentiment with the advice he received from his dear friend and fellow actor, Clint Eastwood.\"There is a saying about old age — 'Keep moving' — and what Clint Eastwood, 95, says: 'Don't let the old man in,'\" Freeman told AARP earlier this month.\"The way to do that is to keep getting up in the morning, keep working out in the gym, keep taking your vitamins, keep taking your prescribed meds, and keep moving. Keep moving. That is the secret to it all.\"And Freeman is doing just that. This year, he starred in the third installment of the \"Now You See Me\" movie franchise, reprising his role as Thaddeus Bradley.Common suggestions from centenarians and people over the age of 80 are to stay active and to never retire. Those tips align with the rules of ikigai, a Japanese principle that is often linked to longevity and wellness.You get the most movement out of golf at my age. It's a great sport for older adults.In his free time, much of what Freeman does aligns with his hack for longevity, which is to keep moving. A passion of his is playing golf, and he believes it's a wonderful sport to keep up with at his age.\"You get the most movement out of golf at my age, mind you,\" Freeman said. \"It's walking, stooping, bending, swinging, cussing. It's a great sport for older adults.\"As Freeman nears 90, his primary concern is if advancing in age will affect his ability to play the sport he loves. \"Will I still be playing golf? That's the question,\" he said.Another important choice that Freeman made throughout his acting career was never letting his accolades get to his head, even after he won an Oscar in 2005. That's the same advice he has for actors and actresses who aspire to achieve the same today.\"It didn't change me one whit. I kind of knew early on that I would eventually get one. It didn't change me. I hope it didn't change me,\" Freeman said. \"Because the only change you can expect after you've gotten an Oscar is maybe your price goes up a tiny bit and your job prospects go up a bit. That's the one thing or two things I guess you could look forward to. Other than that, don't let your ego get the best of you.\"Black Friday sale: Want to up your AI skills and be more productive? Get 25% off our most popular course of the year, How to Use AI to Be More Successful at Work, with coupon code GETSMART.

    "body": "We're often inundated with relationship advice that rarely captures the complexity of what actually makes love work.As a couples counselor with a decade of experience working with couples and individuals trying to find and stay in love, I've found that one of the most underrated signs of a healthy and resilient relationship is a concept called \"mutual influence.\"Coined by married psychologists Drs. John and Julie Gottman, mutual influence means that you are willing to let your partner's needs, vulnerabilities, and perspectives shape you, and even change something about your own behavior.This quality generally only comes into focus during moments of tension or disagreement, not during easy harmony. At the beginning of a relationship, everyone is usually on their best behavior, which can make this valuable green flag hard to spot early on. Here's how to identify and develop it in your own relationship.  What mutual influence looks like In a 2020 study, psychologists followed nearly 320 couples and found that when both partners felt their voice truly mattered and could genuinely impact the other, relationship quality stayed high and emotional security deepened over the years. Couples who ignored this dynamic stagnated and became more insecure as their satisfaction with their relationship eroded.​When both partners experience mutual influence, the psychologists found that relationships not only feel fairer, but they actually are more stable and loving. Individuals report less anxiety about their partner's commitment, and small conflicts are less likely to snowball into chronic gridlock.This is what mutual influence looks like in practice:Setting your phone aside when your partner says, \"I need you to really hear me right now.\"Going a different route on a road trip because your partner feels anxious about traffic, even if you think your way is faster. Deciding to spend the holidays with their family this year after hearing how much it means to them, even though your tradition was always different. Choosing to pause a personal project for the evening because your partner asks for some help finishing theirs. Switching off the lights when they mention they have a headache.Accepting their feedback about how you speak during disagreements and choosing to change your tone or words, not because you have to, but because you want them to feel safer and closer to you. Mutual influence isn't about giving up your identity in your relationship or shelving what you need for the sake of keeping the peace. True openness means maintaining your values, while still making room for your partner's experience, especially when the two of you don't see eye-to-eye. You are creating a shared life where both of your voices matter.How to develop mutual influence in your relationshipEach week, consciously make one accommodation that you know is important to them. This could be a habit of yours, or making room for a preference of theirs. This signals to your partner that you hear them. So try their restaurant pick, take their suggested route, adjust the thermostat to their ideal temperature. Being flexible in low-stakes moments makes it far easier to access that quality during high-stakes ones.During conflict, I'm also a big fan of asking the question: \"What am I missing that would help this make more sense?\" It's a disarming query because it shows that you're not fighting to be right, but to better understand what's going on in your partner's head.These are small gestures that might look insignificant from the outside, but over time, they create the sense of being considered, included, and influential, which are the conditions where real intimacy takes root. That is what separates the couples who merely coexist from those who continually grow closer.​Baya Voce is a relationship expert who helps couples come back together after conflict.

    "body": "Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-CA)Yuri Gripas | ReutersRep. Eric Swalwell, D-Calif., filed a 19-page lawsuit Tuesday in U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C., alleging Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Bill Pulte abused his authority to make \"fanciful\" mortgage fraud allegations against him and other critics of President Donald Trump.The lawsuit asks the court to declare Pulte's conduct unlawful, order him and the FHFA to withdraw a criminal mortgage fraud referral, and award damages for violations of federal privacy law.Swalwell — who announced Friday that he is running for governor of California — alleges in the complaint that Pulte improperly accessed and leaked his private mortgage records in retaliation for his political speech, violating both the Privacy Act of 1974 and the First Amendment.\"Director Pulte has combed through private records of political opponents to silence them,\" Swalwell posted in a statement on X.The suit alleges Pulte's referral of the matter to the Justice Department was \"patently false,\" noting that Swalwell had sworn in an affidavit that his Washington, D.C., home would be his wife's primary residence and that he remained a California resident.Swalwell's lawyers note in the filing that the disclosures landed just as Swalwell prepared to launch his gubernatorial bid. The leak of Pulte's referral letter to the media occurred \"with remarkable speed,\" the suit states, followed by conservative commentators posting details about his home where his wife and children live, activity Swalwell's suit says increased security risks for his family.The filing casts Pulte's actions as part of a broader effort by the Trump administration to use federal agencies and the courts against political opponents. Swalwell, a seven-term congressman and former House impeachment manager during Trump's second impeachment, has long been one of the most vocal critics of the president. \"Pulte's brazen practice of obtaining confidential mortgage records from Fannie Mae and/or Freddie Mac and then using them as a basis for referring individual homeowners to DOJ for prosecution is unprecedented and unlawful,\" the lawsuit argues. In recent months, Pulte has issued similar criminal referrals to Swalwell's to other Trump critics, among them New York Attorney General Letitia James, Sen. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., and Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook. James' indictment was dismissed by a federal judge Monday while Schiff faces an ongoing probe though has not been charged. Cook also has not been charged, though Trump cited the criminal referral as cause in his attempt to fire her from the board of governors for the Federal Reserve in August. The firing is currently on hold pending a Supreme Court review.Pulte defended his agency's criminal referral of Cook to CNBC in August, saying it wasn't politically motivated. \"We make referrals almost every day. Lisa Cook happened to be one of them,\" he said.In an interview with \"Squawk Box\" in September, Pulte refused to tell host Andrew Ross Sorkin where the tip came from.\"I'm not going to explain our sources and methods, where we get tips from, who are whistleblowers,\" Pulte said.Swalwell's lawsuit says no comparable FHFA criminal referrals have been made against Trump allies. There is evidence that top Trump officials like Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent made mortgage claims similar to ones Trump cited to try to fire Cook.Spokespeople for the FHFA and DOJ did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment.",

However, they provide insights into demand and expectations of sales from smartphone makers.Apple's success is being driven by its iPhone 17 series launched in September, which, according to Counterpoint, had a \"bumper\" holiday sales season.Sales of the iPhone 17 series in the U.S. — including the iPhone Air — during the first four weeks after launch was 12% higher than that of the iPhone 16 series, excluding the iPhone 16e, the research firm said. In China, a critical market for Apple, sales of the iPhone 17 series during the same period were 18% higher than its predecessor.\"Beyond the highly positive market reception for the iPhone 17 series, the key driver behind the upgraded shipment outlook lies in the replacement cycle reaching its inflection point. Consumers who purchased smartphones during the COVID-19 boom are now entering their upgrade phase,\" Counterpoint Research Senior Analyst Yang Wang, said in the note. Samsung meanwhile, could face challenges in the low-to-mid tier of the smartphone market from Chinese players, which could hamper the South Korean giant's ability to reclaim the top spot, Counterpoint said. Apple longer-term boostCounterpoint Research forecasts Apple will hold the top spot in the global smartphone market through 2029. The analysts laid out a few reasons why.Firstly, 358 million second-hand iPhones were sold between 2023 and the second quarter of 2025. \"These users are also likely to upgrade to a new iPhone in the coming years. These factors will form a sizable demand base, which is expected to sustain iPhone shipment growth over the coming quarters,\" Counterpoint Research said.Apple benefited from a lower-than-expected impact from tariffs given the trade truce between the U.S. and China. This helped Apple's broader supply chain and growth in certain regions, such as emerging markets. The tech giant also benefited from a weaker U.S. dollar and a \"resilient economic outlook\" that boosted consumer confidence.\"With these structural tailwinds, Apple is well-positioned to surpass Samsung in annual shipments in 2025,\" Wang said.Meanwhile, Apple is expected to launch the entry level iPhone 17e next year as well as a foldable smartphone, Counterpoint forecast. The research firm said it expects the previously-announced improvements to Apple's virtual assistant Siri as well as a \"major iPhone design revamp\" in 2027, to also underpin Apple's dominance over the next few years.\"By expanding its lineup across multiple price tiers, including the growing \"e\" series, and potential adjustments to the Pro and Base launch cycles, Apple is strategically positioning itself to capture rising demand from aspirational consumers, particularly in emerging markets, and to strengthen its presence in the lower premium segment, which is projected to grow faster than the overall market,\" Counterpoint said.\"Given an increasing preference for the iOS ecosystem, compatibility between devices and a substantial number of older models within Apple's installed base due for renewal, Apple will retain the lead over other smartphone OEMs through the end of the decade.\"",

    "body": "In this pool photograph distributed by the Russian state agency Sputnik, Russia's President Vladimir Putin attends a meeting of the Collective Security Treaty Organisation (CSTO) Heads of State Council at the Yntymak Ordo (Palace of Unity) presidential residence in Bishkek on November 27, 2025. Alexander Kazakov | Afp | Getty ImagesRussian President Vladimir Putin has broken his silence on a U.S.-backed peace plan to end the war in Ukraine, saying Moscow is ready for \"serious\" discussions about the draft proposals.Putin said Thursday that the outlines of a fledgling peace plan that has been reached by the U.S. and Ukraine could be the basis of a deal that ends the almost four-year long conflict.\"In general, we agree that this can be the basis for future agreements,\" Putin said in comments made during a trip to Kyrgyzstan and translated by Reuters.The president added that the U.S. appeared to be taking Russia's position on a peace settlement \"into account\" and that Moscow was ready for \"serious discussions\" when U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff travels to Moscow next week for talks.It's the first time Putin has publicly addressed a peace plan since a flurry of diplomacy between the U.S. and Ukraine in the last few days. Those talks came after reports last week of a U.S.-Russia devised 28-point peace plan, which appeared to heavily favor Russia's demands.  Ukraine and its European allies' scrambled to mount a response, amending the plan and inserting counter proposals which were discussed in Geneva last weekend with a U.S. delegation led by U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio. All eyes on RussiaThe current draft plan, which has reportedly been slimmed down to 19 key proposals, appears to have received Ukraine's tentative backing, putting the ball back in Russia's court as to whether it could accept the framework and build upon it.On Wednesday, Putin's close aide Yuri Ushakov had claimed that Russia had not even seen an official version of the latest U.S.-backed draft deal for Ukraine, but that it had seen an unofficial version.Regarding the plan it had seen, Ushakov said the Kremlin viewed some aspects of the plan positively while \"several of its points require serious analysis.\"Sergei Ryabkov, Russia's deputy foreign minister, said Moscow welcomed U.S. efforts on peace proposals but said \"there are no concessions on key issues on the Ukraine settlement,\" suggesting there could be some distance to travel before a deal is actually reached. Putin's Press Secretary Dmitry Peskov warned on Wednesday against jumping to conclusions regarding an end to the war, which Russia launched when it invaded Ukraine in Feb. 2022.\"Wait. It's too early to say that,\" Peskov told reporters, state news agency TASS reported, when asked whether this was the closest Russia and Ukraine had ever been to concluding a peace agreement. Putin on Thursday praised Russian advances in Ukraine and told reporters that the fighting in Ukraine would stop only when Ukrainian troops withdraw from their positions in key areas. If they did not do so, then Russian forces would achieve their objectives by force, he added, appearing to suggest that Moscow was not willing to give up one of its key objectives in the war (and contained within the initial peace plan secretly drafted with the U.S.) which was to have full control of Ukraine's eastern Donbas region.CNBC has contacted the Kremlin for further comment and is awaiting a response.Ukraine on board, tentativelyMultiple outlets reported Tuesday that a Ukrainian delegation that had held talks with U.S. officials in Abu Dhabi on Tuesday appeared to tentatively support the basis of a U.S.-backed peace plan — though key details remained unresolved.ABC News and CBS News both reported an unnamed U.S. official had said that the Ukrainians \"have agreed\" to the deal, while adding there were still points that had to be ironed out. It was unclear if both stories quoted the same U.S. official.Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said later Tuesday that Kyiv was ready to advance the peace framework, Reuters reported, citing a copy of a speech the president gave to a coalition of allied countries.U.S. President Donald Trump said at the White House on Tuesday, \"I think we're getting very close to a deal. We'll find out ... I think we're making progress.\"In a Truth Social post later Tuesday afternoon, Trump said, \"there are only a few remaining points of disagreement.\"",

    "body": "Actors Chris Tucker and Jackie Chan arrive to the premiere of \"Rush Hour 3\" at Mann's Chinese Theater on July 30, 2007 in Hollywood, California. Jeff Vespa | WireImage | Getty ImagesA push from President Donald Trump led Paramount Skydance to revive its \"Rush Hour\" buddy cop movie series, two decades after the last installment, according to multiple reports Tuesday.Paramount has secured funding for \"Rush Hour 4\" and struck a distribution arrangement with Warner Bros. Discovery, which previously owned the franchise under its New Line banner, Puck's Matthew Belloni reported. The project had been in limbo for years.Studios were repeatedly approached about a new installment, but had balked at working with director Brett Ratner.Ratner's career collapsed in 2017 after several female actors accused him of sexual misconduct. He has denied the allegations and was never charged.Belloni reported that Paramount's decision to release \"Rush Hour 4\" came \"after prodding from Trump on behalf of Brett Ratner,\" who will direct the film.Ratner, in late 2024, was tapped to direct a documentary about first lady Melania Trump for Amazon Prime, which reportedly paid $40 million for the rights to make it.In the \"Rush Hour 4\" deal, Paramount will collect a flat distribution fee to release the film in theaters, Variety first reported. Warner Bros. will take an undisclosed share of box-office receipts before financiers recoup costs.Paramount Skydance and Warner Bros. did not respond to requests for comment. The White House also did not respond to a request for comment.The first three \"Rush Hour\" films were global hits, particularly in China, earning more than $850 million worldwide, according to box office estimates. They also turned Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker into major stars.But the new sequel faces a changed theatrical landscape where comedies have struggled at the box office.And at 71 years old, Chan has scaled back U.S. studio work, while Tucker has not headlined a major film since 2007.Both Chan and Tucker are expected to be in the new film.Trump's intervention in Hollywood has drawn criticism. He has informally tapped allies including Sylvester Stallone, Jon Voight, and Mel Gibson as cultural emissaries, and has repeatedly said he wants to restore what he calls \"classical masculinity\" to studio filmmaking.For Paramount, the \"Rush Hour\" revival comes as the newly combined studio aims to nearly double its output, targeting 15 films in 2026 and up to 18 by 2028.The timing also overlaps with a major industry shake-up: Paramount Skydance, Comcast, and Netflix have all submitted first-round bids to acquire Warner Bros. The company's portfolio includes some of entertainment's most valuable franchises, from DC to Harry Potter.Paramount is bidding for all of Warner Bros. Its proposal, previously valued at about $23.50 per share, would bring the entire company — the studio, HBO Max, and the cable networks — under one owner.Comcast is reportedly interested in the studio and streaming assets, including Warner Bros. and HBO Max. The deal would fold those pieces into NBCUniversal and let Warner Bros. Discovery spin off CNN and TNT Sports before the deal closes. Netflix is also interested in the film and streaming assets, people familiar with the matter previously told CNBC.Warner Bros. Discovery aims to have its sale process wrapped by mid- to late-December, CNBC previously reported.Disclosure: Comcast is the parent company of NBCUniversal, which owns CNBC. Versant would become the new parent company of CNBC upon Comcast's planned spinoff of Versant.",

Michael Nagle | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesBlack Friday is proving more popular for younger consumers than for their elders, according to a new report provided exclusively to CNBC.AT&T Business' 2025 Holiday Shopping Survey, conducted by Morning Consult, found that 40% of Generation Z members and 32% of millennials plan to do most of their shopping on Black Friday. Older generations, on the other hand, prefer to shop later in the season, just a week or two before Christmas, the survey found.  \"Black Friday is always such a big deal, and the pricing and the offers and advertising that's done during that time is probably what would draw Gen Z, especially things done on social media,\" said Angela Rutherford, AT&T's vice president of mid-market sales.The enthusiasm for Black Friday comes even as Gen Z plans to pull back their spending. Read more CNBC Black Friday newsShoppers curtail Black Friday spending: 'They are using every tool that they can,' expert saysBlack Friday is most popular with Gen Z, even as the holiday loses its shine, new survey findsBlack Friday car deals are sparser this year, analyst says: ‘Buyers may be a little disappointed’Pro: Wall Street’s favorite holiday shopping stocks as Black Friday nearsConsulting firm PwC reported in September that Gen Z shoppers plan to spend 23% less on average this holiday season than a year ago – the sharpest decline of any generation and a significant change from the previous year, when Gen Z said they planned to spend 37% more.And as non-wealthy Americans face pressures of higher prices and economic uncertainty, some reports are showing signs of a \"K-shaped\" economy that may stretch into the holiday season, with wealthier consumers spending more and lower-income consumers shopping more conservatively.A new Deloitte survey found that consumers at large plan to spend 4% less on Black Friday than they did last year, primarily due to concerns of financial constraints and a higher cost of living.Still, Rutherford said consumers are being more \"intentional and value-driven\" in their holiday shopping this year. That spending is translating into more support for small businesses rather than large legacy retailers, with 77% of consumers reporting they would do all of their holiday shopping at small businesses if they could and if the pricing was the same, according to AT&T's survey. Compared with last year, the number of survey respondents who said they shop at small businesses to boost their local economies grew by 8 percentage points. \"I think there's a price consciousness out there, combined with a, 'If I can still save money or get a good price, I will still shop local,' type of mentality out there,\" Rutherford said. The AT&T survey also found that 72% of people reported getting their gift ideas from in-person shopping rather than from social media. And even as artificial intelligence begins to reshape the way people shop, more than half of shoppers said they were more likely to use traditional online search methods for their gifting this holiday season than AI – just 9% of those surveyed said they are more likely to use AI to find gifts. \"AI has exploded over the last couple years, and it's infiltrating all aspects of life,\" Rutherford said. \"I think as time goes on, you will see a shift from the traditional search to AI for shopping.\"",

Donald John Trump at the Fulton County Courthouse on March 1, 2024, in Atlanta, Georgia.Alex Slitz-Pool | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesThose efforts included pressuring Georgia's secretary of state, Brad Raffensperger, to find Trump enough votes for him to overcome his margin of loss to Biden.The case was once seen as one of the biggest threats to the GOP leader, who was already grappling with a torrent of other criminal indictments and civil lawsuits. At least four of Trump's 18 co-defendants pleaded guilty within two months of the indictment being filed.It also produced one of the most striking images in recent U.S. political history: a mugshot of the president, who was forced to travel to Fulton County jail to be booked on the state charges.But the case ran into major problems long before Trump's reelection in 2024 effectively put it on ice.In September 2024, McAfee tossed out two of the criminal counts against Trump and some of his co-defendants, though he kept the top charges intact.By that time, Willis was facing intensifying scrutiny over her romantic relationship with Nathan Wade, one of the top prosecutors in the criminal case. She defended herself in dramatic courtroom testimony against the allegations of impropriety, but was disqualified from the case in December 2024.The Georgia Supreme Court declined to hear Willis' appeal. The case was eventually handed to Skandalakis on Nov. 14, less than two weeks before he asked McAfee to dismiss it.Read more CNBC politics coverageJudge dismisses James Comey and Letitia James cases over 'unlawful' prosecutor appointmentSen.

    "body": "The first day of sale of the iPhone 15 smartphone in Mumbai, India, on Sept. 22, 2023.Dhiraj Singh | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesApple has filed a case in the Delhi High Court against the country's antitrust body because of how it considers global turnover when calculating penalties.The iPhone maker, which is among the fastest-growing smartphone brands in India, is challenging India's new antitrust law under which the U.S. company could face fines of up to $38 billion, according to a report by Reuters.Apple added that it was \"unconstitutional, grossly disproportionate, unjust\" for the Competition Commission of India (CCI) to use turnover when calculating penalties.Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment from CNBC.The CCI has been investigating complaints from an alliance of Indian startups and Tinder-owner Match Group that accuse Apple of \"abusive conduct,\" which forces developers to pay high commissions for in-app purchases. Apple denied the charges.The CCI's final verdict is still pending, but it said its \"prima facie view [is] that mandatory use of Apple's IAP for paid apps and in-app purchases restricts the choice available to the app developers to select a payment processing system of their choice,\" in an order in December 2021.Apple recorded its highest-ever quarterly shipments in India of 5 million units in the third quarter of 2025, according to data from IDC. watch nowThe company is expected to sell about 15 million iPhones in India this year and could rank among the top five smartphone companies there, Navkendar Singh, associate vice president with IDC India,  on Nov. 18.Apple is among the global companies diversifying their manufacturing supply chains away from China to India. In 2024, Apple's exports from India hit a record of $12.8 billion, up more than 42% from a year earlier.",

    "body": "Alibaba announced plans to release a pair of smart glasses powered by its AI models. The Quark AI Glasses are Alibaba's first foray into the smart glasses product category.AlibabaAlibaba's artificial intelligence-powered smart glasses went on sale on Thursday as the Chinese tech giant looks to ramp up its focus on consumer AI in an increasingly competitive market. The Quark AI Glasses, first announced in July, come in two variants — the S1, which starts at  3,799 Chinese yuan ($536) and G1 at 1,899 yuan.The tech giant has integrated its Qwen AI models — Alibaba's version of ChatGPT — with the device which also links to its newly-launched Qwen app. This means users can use voice control to get the glasses to carry out tasks.The lenses of the glasses are effectively screens and the device has a camera built into the frame. The main difference between the S1 and G1 is the display, Alibaba said.watch nowThe company said that some of the features include on-the-go translation, AI-generated meeting notes and the ability to ask the virtual assistants questions. Users take pictures of a product using the camera in the lens and then the device will show the price of that product on Taobao, Alibaba's main shopping app in China. Alibaba, like other technology companies such as U.S. giant Meta, are betting that smart glasses could be the next big consumer device after the smartphone.In September, Meta unveiled the $799 Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses, the social media company's first consumer-ready smart glasses with a built-in display. Users can control the device via hand gestures with a special wristband. Alibaba's glasses will initially go on sale in China and compete with domestic rivals, including consumer electronics maker Xiaomi and startup Xreal. The smart glasses market is still small but growing rapidly. By 2026, shipments of AI glasses are expected to exceed more than 10 million units, doubling from 2025, according to a forecast from Omdia. For Alibaba, the glasses are its latest play in the consumer AI market as it looks to build on its recent successes. The company's ChatGPT-style Qwen app got 10 million downloads in the first week of the public beta launch. Meanwhile, Alibaba's cloud computing business, where it books much of its AI-relate revenue, saw an acceleration of growth in the last quarter.The Hangzhou, headquartered company is one of the leaders in China's AI space, and has been investing aggressively in AI alongside rival giants like Baidu and Tencent, and aggressively launching new models.",

Puma forecast slower profit growth as new Chief Executive Officer Arne Freundt confronts excess inventory and higher costs for marketing sneakers and apparel. Photographer: Krisztian Bocsi/Bloomberg via Getty ImagesBloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesPuma shares finished 18.9% higher on Thursday following a report that China's Anta Sports is among a number of firms looking to buy the struggling German athletic brand.Puma is in the middle of what is calls a \"reset,\" as sales growth has dramatically dropped after a revenue bump during Covid-19. Post-pandemic, however, the brand has wrestled with fading customer resonance with customers and resulting high inventories.Earlier this month, shares hit their lowest level in more than 10 years, while year-to-date losses amount to more than 50% amid an increasingly competitive sportswear market and tariffs hitting customer sentiment. The company is now reportedly considering a buy-out, according to a report from Bloomberg citing unnamed sources. Hong Kong-listed Anta Sports is said to weigh a potential bid for the sportswear maker, the outlet reported. Puma declined to comment and Anta Sports didn't immediately to respond to a CNBC request for comment.For Anta, acquiring Puma could be a gateway to the Western world, said Metzler analyst Felix Dennl, noting the Chinese company's strong track record in turning around underperforming assets. \"On the one hand, Anta already has broad-based international market exposure via its stake in Amer Group, hence the additional value add from Puma is expected to add to the portfolio is not completely clear,\" he added.Puma may also attract interest from Chinese apparel firm Li Ning and Japan's Asics Corp, the Bloomberg report said. \"As of now, the company has not engaged in any substantive negotiations or evaluations regarding the transaction mentioned in the news,\" Li Ning said in an emailed statement. Asics didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. Puma's Frankfurt-listed shares were up 13.7% by 12:30 p.m. London time (7:30 a.m. ET), before ending the session up 18.9%.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconPuma shares year-to-datePuma CEO Arthur Hoeld, who was appointed on July 1, is tasked with reviving the ailing brand. His turnaround plan involves cutting jobs, narrowing its product range, and improving marketing operations.\"At the end of July, we stated that 2025 would be a year of reset,\" Hoeld said in a statement on Oct. 30. \"Since then, we have taken important steps to clean up PUMA's distribution, improve our cash management and reset our operational expenses. By expanding our cost efficiency programme, we are moving quickly to address challenges and make the business more efficient and resilient.\"The company also said it is aiming to establish itself as a \"Top 3 global sports brand,\" as it reported quarterly sales that fell on a double digit basis. Puma acknowledged that key challenges included a muted brand momentum, U.S. tariffs, and high inventory levels.In July, the company cut its 2025 guidance, saying its now expecting a sales decline at a low double-digit percentage rate, from a previous guide of sales growth at a low- to mid-single digit percentage rate. It also said it expects to post an operating profit loss in 2025 — a huge swing from the previously expected profit of between 445 million euros ($516 million) and 525 million euros — due to the impact of tariffs. watch nowPuma's biggest shareholder is currently Artemis which holds a 29% stake in the company. Artemis — the holding company of France's billionaire Pinault family as well as the largest shareholder of Gucci-owner Kering — has been on a spending spree and has seen its debt balloon. Artemis' valuation expectations for Puma may be a major hurdle to any transaction involving the athletic brand, Bloomberg reported.-- Karen Gilchrist contributed to this report. ",

    "body": "Vcg | Visual China Group | Getty ImagesWhen ChatGPT launched in 2022, Google was caught flatfooted, but the launch of Gemini 3 and the Ironwood AI chip this month has experts raving about Alphabet's AI comeback. Google kicked off November by unveiling Ironwood, the seventh generation of its tensor processing units, or TPUs, that the company says lets customers \"run and scale the largest, most data-intensive models in existence.\" And last week, Google launched Gemini 3, its latest artificial intelligence model, saying it requires \"less prompting\" and provides smarter answers than its predecessors. Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff captured the excitement around Gemini 3 with a Sunday post on X, saying that despite using OpenAI's ChatGPT daily for three years, he wasn't going back after two hours of using Gemini 3. \"The leap is insane,\" wrote Benioff, whose company has partnerships with Google, OpenAI and other frontier AI model providers. \"Everything is sharper and faster. It feels like the world just changed, again.\"Most tech stocks were down to start the week, except for one: Alphabet. Shares of the Google parent surged more than 5% on Monday, adding to last week's gain of more than 8%. Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway revealed earlier this month that it owns a $4.3 billion stake in Alphabet as of the end of the third quarter. Alphabet shares are up nearly 70% this year and have outperformed Meta's by more than 50 percentage points this year, and last week, Alphabet's market cap surpassed Microsoft's.All of this came despite Nvidia reporting stronger-than-expect revenue and guidance in its third-quarter earnings last week.\"You may be asking why almost all of the AI stocks we cover are selling off after such good news from Nvidia,\" Melius Research analyst Ben Reitzes wrote in a note Monday, referring to Nvidia's positive third quarter earnings last week. \"There is one real reason for worry and it is the 'AI comeback' of Alphabet.\" But while Google appears to have regained the edge, its lead over rivals remains razor thin in the gruelingly competitive AI market, experts said. Sundar Pichai, chief executive officer of Alphabet Inc., during the Bloomberg Tech conference in San Francisco, California, US, on Wednesday, June 4, 2025. David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesPutting the pieces togetherWith Gemini 3 and Ironwood, Google CEO Sundar Pichai appears to have finally put the pieces together for the company's AI offerings, said Michael Nathanson, co-founder of equity research firm Moffett Nathanson. Google is serving a broad range of customers from consumers to enterprise, something the company initially struggled to do after the arrival of ChatGPT. \"Three years ago, they were seen as kind of lost and there were all these hot takes saying they lost their way and Sundar is a failure,\" Nathanson said. \"Now, they have a huge leg up.\"The company had a number of AI product mishaps in its initial attempts to catch up with OpenAI. In 2024 alone, Google had to pull its image generation product Imagen 2 for several months after users discovered a number of historical inaccuracies. The launch of AI Overviews caused a similar reaction when users discovered it gave faulty advice, which the company later remedied with additional guardrails.\"There was a lot of fumbling, and they were scrambling,\" said Gil Luria, managing director at technology research firm DA Davidson. \"But they had the tech in the pantry, and it was just a matter of getting it all together and shipped.\"Of particular note is how quickly Google launched Gemini 3 after the spring release of Gemini 2.5, which was already considered an impressive model. The hyper-realistic image generation features of Nano Banana is another notch in Google's belt. After the company initially launched the image generation tool, Gemini shot to the top of the Apple App Store in September, dethroning ChatGPT. And after the launch of Gemini 3, Google released Nano Banana Pro last week. Google's ownership of YouTube and all the content on the video platform gives the company an edge when it comes to training models for image and video generation. \"The amount of video and current data that Google has, that's really a huge competitive advantage,\" said Mike Gualtieri, vice president and principal analyst for Forrester Research. \"I don't see how OpenAI and Anthropic can overcome that.\"Additionally, Google has successfully incorporated its AI models into its enterprise products, driving sales for the company's cloud unit. In its third quarter earnings results last month, Google reached its first $100 billion quarter, boosted by its cloud growth. The company's cloud unit, which houses its AI services, showed solid growth and a $155 billion backlog from customers. And it's not just the AI models. Google is also garnering attention with its AI chips. Google says Ironwood is nearly 30 times more power efficient than its first TPU from 2018. Google's ASIC chips are emerging as the company's secret weapon in the AI wars and have helped it notch recent deals worth billions with customers such as Anthropic. After a report said that Meta could strike a deal with Google to use its TPUs for the social media company's data centers, Nvidia saw its stock drop 3% on Tuesday, prompting the chipmaker to post a response on social media. With the rise of Google's TPUs, Nvidia may no longer have the AI chips market cornered.\"The advantage of having the whole stack is you can optimize your model to work specifically well on a TPU chip and you're building everything to a more optimally designed,\" said Luria.The company's ability to serve AI enterprise customers with its TPUs and Google Cloud offerings as well as its incorporation of Gemini 3 throughout its consumer products is driving Wall Street's enthusiasm.Experts who spoke with CNBC said the competitive landscape is broader than just one AI winner, but they added that it's become increasingly expensive for multiple companies to prove success.Tight competitionDespite these wins, Google is still in fierce competition with other AI companies, experts said.\"Having the state of the art model for a few days doesn't mean they've won to the extent that the stock market is implying,\" Luria said, pointing to Anthropic's new Opus 4.5 model launched Monday. Earlier this month, OpenAI also announced two updates to its GPT-5 model to make it \"warmer by default and more conversational\" as well as \"more efficient and easier to understand in everyday use,\" the company said. \"The frontier models still seem to be neck and neck in some ways,\" Forrester Research's Gualtieri said.The competitive edge will likely go to the companies willing to spend more money given the expenses of the AI race, experts said. In their earnings reports last month, Alphabet, Meta, Microsoft and Amazon each lifted their guidance for capital expenditures. They collectively expect that number to reach more than $380 billion this year.\"These companies are spending a lot of money assuming there's gonna be a winner take all when in reality we may end up with frontier models being a commodity and several will be interchangeable,\" Luria said.For Google, maintaining a lead in AI won't be without challenges. Company executives told employees earlier this month that Google has to double its serving capacity every six month to meet demand for AI services and run its frontier models, CNBC reported last week. \"The competition in AI infrastructure is the most critical and also the most expensive part of the AI race,\" Google Cloud Vice President Amin Vahdat told employees.Although Google's in-house TPUs have gotten increased attention as viable alternatives to Nvidia's Blackwell chips, Nvidia still holds more than 90% of the AI chip market. In its post on Tuesday, Nvidia pointed out that its chips are more flexible and powerful than ASIC chips, like Google's Ironwood, which are typically designed for a single company or function.And despite getting Salesforce's Benioff to switch to Gemini, Google also has a lot of catching up to do with its consumer chat product, experts said, citing hallucinations and lower user numbers than OpenAI's.The Gemini app has 650 million monthly active users and AI Overviews has 2 billion monthly users, Google said last month. OpenAI, by comparison, said in August that ChatGPT hit 700 million users per week.  \"Yes, Google has got its act together,\" Luria said. \"But that doesn't mean they've won.\"WATCH: AI narrative is shifting towards Google with its complete stack, says Plexo Capital's Lo Toneywatch now",

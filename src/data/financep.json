    "body": "Masayoshi Son, chairman and chief executive officer of SoftBank Group Corp., speaks at the SoftBank World event in Tokyo, Japan, on Wednesday, July 16, 2025. Speaking via teleconference, Son and OpenAI chief Sam Altman argued that advancing artificial intelligence would lead to new jobs that are not yet imagined, and the advancement of robotics will help kickstart a \"self-improvement\" loop. Photographer: Kiyoshi Ota/Bloomberg via Getty ImagesBloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesShares of SoftBank Group plunged as much as 10% Wednesday after the Japanese giant said it had sold its entire stake in U.S. chip giant Nvidia for $5.83 billion. The capital will be used to fund SoftBank's $22.5 billion investment in ChatGPT parent OpenAI, a person familiar with the matter told CNBC.Shares of SoftBank Group last traded more than 6% lower.In its earnings report, SoftBank said it sold 32.1 million Nvidia shares in October. It also trimmed its T-Mobile position, raising $9.17 billion.\"We want to provide a lot of investment opportunities for investors, while we can still maintain financial strength,\" said SoftBank's chief financial officer, Yoshimitsu Goto, during an investor presentation.While the decision to unload Nvidia shares may have caught some investors off guard, it isn't SoftBank's first exit from the U.S. chip heavyweight.The company's Vision Fund was an early Nvidia supporter, reportedly building a $4 billion stake in 2017 before fully divesting in January 2019. Despite the latest sale, SoftBank remains closely tied to Nvidia through its broader business interests.\"This is a bullish signal on the theme from SoftBank doubling down and not a bearish sign in our view,\" said Dan Ives, global head of technology research at Wedbush Securities.While OpenAI is central to SoftBank's GenAI portfolio, hardware remains a priority as well, mostly through its stake in British chip designer Arm, with which SoftBank is co-developing products, said Rolf Bulk, equity research analyst at New Street Research. SoftBank has a controlling stake in U.K-based Arm Holdings, whose chip designs power mobile and AI processors.Several other tech stocks in the region also declined. Semiconductor testing equipment maker Advantest and Tokyo Electron, a chip production equipment maker, slipped over 2%.Taiwan's TSMC, the world's largest contract chipmaker, fell 0.34%. South Korean memory chip giant SK Hynix was 1.62% lower.—CNBC's Dylan Butts and April Roach contributed to this report.",

    "body": "Jacob Cooper's Saturdays don't look like a typical 29-year-old's.On a recent one, Cooper was up by 4:15 a.m., out of his Brooklyn apartment by 4:30, and ready to cook at a nearby commercial kitchen by 5. He and his staff prepared hundreds of hand-rolled, bite-sized bagels they'd sell that day across two events in New York City.Cooper spent his morning selling freshly baked pizza bagels to pop-up shoppers in Fort Greene, Brooklyn, worked at the Queens Night Market until midnight, and finally ended his day at home at 2 a.m.Despite the 22-hour day, Cooper says he doesn't regret leaving his former six-figure tech job to start his food business, Pizzabagel.nyc.Cooper launched the business in January 2025 and as of October has brought in close to $92,000 for the year.Jacob Cooper launched a pizza bagel business in 2025 after leaving his previous career in tech.Kaan Oguz | CNBC Make ItHe logs up to 90 hours per week on the job but says it's a 180 from the burnout he felt before.\"Even though I'm working as hard as I ever have, every customer that comes up to the stand and tells me how great they are, every time they come back wanting more, it helps keep me going,\" Cooper says. \"I have a lot of fun doing this.\"From burnout to bagelsCooper didn't plan to become a pizza bagels pro. His first career was in tech.He studied computer science at Cornell and in 2017 co-founded an AI company with classmates, becoming the startup's chief technology officer. Over the next seven years, the team raised money, hired staff and weathered the Covid-19 pandemic.Jacob Cooper estimates he made some 40,000 bagels before his recipe became consistent.Kaan Oguz | CNBC Make ItBut by 2023, Cooper was burning out. He and the CEO fought a lot, \"and we both kind of said, 'this is not really working,'\" he says. In 2024, Cooper left the company and his $120,000 annual salary without a plan.After a few months of feeling lost, inspiration struck: Cooper loved Bagel Bites when he was a kid, but as an adult revisited them and felt they could use an upgrade.Cooper experimented with pizza bagel recipes with the help of Reddit forums, cookbooks and \"a million\" online videos. He started cooking in his apartment and even bought extra refrigerators so he and his roommate had enough space. Cooper estimates he made some 40,000 bagels before his recipe became consistent.Pizzabagel.nyc currently offers six options, including cheese, pepperoni, spicy vodka, buffalo dip, ricotta and French onion.Kaan Oguz | CNBC Make ItCooper had sold a portion of his equity back to the AI company for $250,000, pocketing about half of that after taxes to pay his rent, insurance and other basic expenses. He also funneled that money into Pizzabagel.nyc. \"That is what allowed me to take a few months off, start this business, buy the equipment, buy the minivan, test things out, [and] lose money on it,\" Cooper says.How the business makes moneyRight now, Pizzabagel.nyc makes money in three ways: pop-ups, catering and farmers markets.It offers six pizza bagel options, including cheese, pepperoni, spicy vodka, buffalo dip, ricotta and French onion. Bagel costs vary, but at the Queens Night Market are sold two for $5.In February, its first month in business, the company made around $3,000 in sales. Cooper bought a car in May and scaled his events way up. The business started to break even over the summer and jumped to roughly $10,000 in sales for July. By September, the business hit a milestone of bringing in $20,000.It was enough to cover the business's expenses for the month. Cooper's operating costs fluctuate, but for September totaled $15,000 including payroll for one full-time employee and a small crew of part-timers, his kitchen rental, food costs, event fees and other costs.Cooper reinvested the $5,000 profit back into the company.Christina Locopo | CNBC Make ItCooper currently doesn't take a salary and plans to pour any profits back into the company. He estimates he has three years' worth of basic living expenses saved to keep this up. He's also invested $50,000 of his own money into the business.\"At the end of the day, I know that if this business doesn't work out, I can go get another tech job or I can do something else,\" Cooper says. \"I'm probably not going to end up on my parents' couch. Probably.\"Learning from old regretsPrior to opening his food business, Cooper says he'd never set foot in a commercial kitchen, cooked professionally or worked a restaurant service job. He worried about his lack of experience in the field.Cooper took the mistakes he learned as a tech leader to set himself up better in the food world.\"My biggest regret is that I was just young and inexperienced and didn't know what I was doing,\" Cooper says about his CTO days. \"I was too stubborn to look for help a lot of the time. Now I know to look for help. I know that I'm a newcomer to the food industry.\"Another big challenge is out of his control: the weather.For example, on a recent rainy Saturday, the business sold $1,000 worth of food at the Queens Night Market compared to the $2,000 it moves on a good day.\"You're basically just praying it's nice weather so people come out and buy stuff,\" Cooper says.Eyes on the freezer aisleCooper says he originally gave himself six months to see if Pizzabagel.nyc had momentum; by the summer, he decided to keep at it and additionally launched Littlebagel.nyc, a sister pop-up operation that specializes in mini-bagels with fun offerings like chili crisp spreads; tomato and ricotta sandwiches; and the classic bacon, egg and cheese.Jacob Cooper launched Littlebagel.nyc in September, a sister pop-up that sells mini bagels with fun spreads and sandwich options.Kaan Oguz | CNBC Make ItEvents will slow in the winter, but Cooper knows his next move: In year two of the business, he wants to get his pizza bagels into the freezer aisle of grocery stores, specifically by his 30th birthday in January. He believes cracking the consumer packaged goods space will mean long-term success for the business.Making and selling pizza bagels might not be his forever career, Cooper says, but he's excited to see where it goes.\"I'm not going to force this business to work for me,\" he says. \"I look at it really practically, and if I'm having fun and I think there's a lot of growth, and people are really enjoying the product, I'm going to keep doing it.\"Jacob Cooper's goal with Pizzabagel.nyc is to get them into the freezer aisle at grocery stores.Kaan Oguz | CNBC Make It",

    "body": "Michael Burry attends the New York premiere of \"The Big Short\" at the Ziegfeld Theater in New York City on Nov. 23, 2015.Jim Spellman | WireImage | Getty ImagesMichael Burry, the investor made famous by \"The Big Short\" who recently roiled the market with a tech short bet, is accusing some of America's largest technology companies of using aggressive accounting to pad their profits from the artificial intelligence boom.In a post Monday on X, the Scion Asset Management founder alleged that \"hyperscalers\" — the major cloud and AI infrastructure providers — are understating depreciation expenses by estimating that chips will have a longer life cycle than is realistic.\"Understating depreciation by extending useful life of assets artificially boosts earnings - one of the more common frauds of the modern era,\" Burry wrote. \"Massively ramping capex through purchase of Nvidia chips/servers on a 2-3 yr product cycle should not result in the extension of useful lives of compute equipment. Yet this is exactly what all the hyperscalers have done.\"Burry estimated that from 2026 through 2028, the accounting maneuver would understate depreciation by about $176 billion, inflating reported earnings across the industry. He singled out Oracle and Meta Platforms, saying their profits could be overstated by roughly 27% and 21%, respectively, by 2028.CNBC has reached out to Oracle and Meta for comments. Nvidia declined to comment. Burry's accusation is a serious one, but could be hard to prove because of the leeway companies are given in estimating depreciation. CNBC was not independently able to confirm this practice was being done by the companies.When paying for a large asset upfront — like semiconductors, servers, etc — a company is then allowed under generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, to spread out the cost of that asset as a yearly expense that is based on the company's estimate of how rapidly that asset depreciates in value. If companies estimate a longer life cycle for the asset, they can then lower the yearly depreciation expense that hits the bottom line.Burry, who famously bet against subprime mortgages before the 2008 financial crisis, has warned this year that AI enthusiasm resembles the late-1990s tech bubble.Burry last week revealed seemingly fresh wagers against AI favorites Nvidia and Palantir Technologies. He disclosed put options with a notional value of about $187 million against Nvidia and $912 million against Palantir as of Sept. 30, according to a regulatory filing. The filing didn't specify the strike prices or expiration dates of the contracts.The disclosure prompted a sharp reaction from Palantir CEO Alex Karp, who called Burry's wagers \"super weird\" and \"bats--- crazy.\" It's not clear whether he still holds those positions or whether they were just a hedge.Shares of Nvidia rebounded nearly 6% on Monday after dropping 7% last week. Palantir saw its shares pop almost 9% on Monday following a 11% sell-off last week. Nvidia was lower again on Tuesday.Burry said in his X post that \"more detail\" was coming on Nov. 25 and that readers should \"stay tuned.\"",

Jean Carroll $5 million in damages after holding him liable for sexually abusing her during an encounter in a New York department store in the 1990s and for defaming her decades later.Trump's request on Monday comes nearly 11 months after the 2nd Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals upheld the verdict issued by a civil jury in Manhattan federal court in May 2023.The petition to the Supreme Court says that Judge Lewis Kaplan, who oversaw the trial, made a \"series of indefensible evidentiary rulings,\" among them \"improperly admitting highly inflammatory propensity evidence against President Trump.\"That evidence included testimony by two other women who alleged that Trump committed sexual misconduct against them at other times.The petition also says that Kaplan erred by allowing Carroll's lawyer to play for jurors the notorious \"Access Hollywood\" tape on which Trump is heard bragging about groping women without their prior consent.There is no automatic right to appeal to the Supreme Court. It is not known when the high court will decide whether to take Trump's appeal.Writer Jean Carroll and Republican presidential nominee and former U.S. President Donald Trump look on as Lawyer John Sauer (not pictured) argues for him, as he is asking a federal appeals court to overturn a $5 million jury verdict finding him liable for sexually assaulting and defaming writer E. Jean Carroll, who accused Trump of raping her nearly three decades ago, in Manhattan, New York, U.S., September 6, 2024, in this court sketch.Jane Rosenberg | ReutersCarroll, in a 2019 New York magazine article, first went public with her allegation that Trump raped her in a dressing room of the Bergdorf Goodman department store in the mid-1990s.She sued him for allegedly defaming her in comments he made while flatly denying that allegation after the article appeared.Carroll later filed a separate lawsuit accusing Trump of rape and of defaming her again in late 2022 when he commented on her allegations.That second lawsuit was the subject of the trial that ended in May 2023. Jurors in that case did not find Trump liable for rape, but did find him liable for sexually abusing Carroll and defaming her.It is that verdict that Trump has asked the Supreme Court to overturn with the new petition.U.S. President Donald Trump speaks, during the swearing-in ceremony for Sergio Gor as U.S. Ambassador to India, at the White House in Washington, D.C., U.S., Nov. 10, 2025. Kevin Lamarque | Reuters\"Carroll waited more than 20 years to falsely accuse Donald Trump, who she politically opposes, until after he became the 45th President, when she could maximize political injury to him and profit for herself,\" the petition says.\"Notably, Carroll's allegations are a story that precisely matches the plotline from an episode of one of admittedly her favorite TV shows, 'Law & Order,' \" the petition says.A spokesman for Trump's legal team, in a statement on the petition, said, \"The American People stand with President Trump as they demand an immediate end to all of the Witch Hunts, including the Democrat-funded travesty of the Carroll Hoaxes.\"\"President Trump will keep winning against Liberal Lawfare, as he continues to focus on his mission to Make America Great Again,\" the spokesman said.Carroll's lawyer, Roberta Kaplan, declined to comment on the petition.Read more CNBC politics coverageDemocrats win big on Election Night in key racesZohran Mamdani wins New York City mayor's race, NBC News projectsDemocratic candidate Mikie Sherrill wins New Jersey governor's race, NBC News projectsDemocrats win Virginia governor, attorney general races, NBC News projectsSNAP update: Trump admin will pay 50% of food stamp benefits in November amid shutdownTrump says he has 'no idea who' Binance's CZ is after pardoning himTrump backtracks on attending Supreme Court tariffs case argumentsThe first defamation lawsuit that Carroll filed against Trump went to trial after the second lawsuit did.In January 2024, a Manhattan federal court jury found Trump liable for defaming Carroll in statements he made as president in 2019 when he denied her claims of rape.That jury ordered him to pay her $83.3 in damages.Trump appealed that verdict.The 2nd Circuit appeals court in September rejected that appeal.\"As observed by the district court, the conduct here supports a significant punitive damages award — it involved malice and deceit, caused severe emotional injury, and continued over at least a five-year period,\" a three-judge panel of the appeals court said in its decision denying Trump's appeal.\"The record in this case supports the district court's determination that the 'the degree of reprehensibility' of Mr. Trump's conduct was remarkably high, perhaps unprecedented,' \" the panel said.Trump has filed a petition with the 2nd Circuit asking that the appeal be reheard by a panel comprised of all active judges on the circuit.",

    "body": "The U.S. Capitol building after the U.S. Senate advances a bill to end the government shutdown in Washington, D.C., U.S.,  November 10, 2025. Evelyn Hockstein | ReutersEconomic data releases that have lagged during the government shutdown likely will take some time to get rolling again once Congress is back in business.The reopening could happen as soon as the end of this week once final votes take place and President Donald Trump signs a stop-gap spending bill into law.From there, though, it will take the various agencies, primarily in the departments of Labor and Commerce, to get up and rolling again as it regards data collection and releases. That means likely having to play catch-up for key reports like nonfarm payrolls, the consumer price index, retail sales, spending and income, and a variety of other metrics.\"The shutdown of the federal government has delayed nearly all federal economic data releases for September and October,\" Goldman Sachs economists Elsie Peng and Ronnie Walker said in a client note. \"While the shutdown appears to be nearing its end, it will take time for the statistical agencies to work through the backlog of releases.\"Assuming the government reopens before the end of the week, Goldman figures the Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics will put out an updated schedule of releases in the early part of next week.watch nowThe BLS is in charge of the payrolls report as well as the CPI and the producer price index, both of which were scheduled for release this week. Other reports from the bureau include import and export prices, the employment cost index, and the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey.Goldman's economists expect the October jobs report to be released soon after the reopening, possibly next Tuesday or Wednesday. \"But apart from that, we expect other major data releases to be delayed,\" they said.That means the November payrolls and inflation reports could be delayed by \"at least a week,\" Goldman said.For Commerce, among the more relevant reports are personal spending and income, which also includes the Federal Reserve's key inflation measure, the personal consumption expenditures price index. Outside of that, there's retail sales, durable goods and the quarterly gross domestic product reading.When the data freeze ends, the reports are likely to show more of the same as far as the economy goes — a slowing labor market, inflation still holding above the Fed's comfort level and broader growth positive but also not gangbusters.Fed officials have noted the inconvenience of not having regular data reports. But Chair Jerome Powell said recently that alternative data shows the central bank really hasn't missed much in terms of the macro picture.\"Although some important federal government data have been delayed due to the shutdown, the public- and private-sector data that have remained available suggest that the outlook for employment and inflation has not changed much since our meeting in September,\" Powell said at an Oct. 29 news conference. \"Conditions in the labor market appear to be gradually cooling, and inflation remains somewhat elevated.\"Economists surveyed by Dow Jones had been expecting the October nonfarm payrolls report to show a loss of 60,000 jobs. While Goldman puts the decline at 50,000, the general tenor of data for the month points to a slowdown.Powell said Fed estimates put the key inflation rate at 2.8% for September, which is still considerably above the central bank's 2% target but expected to decelerate gradually through 2026. The official PCE report is scheduled to drop Nov. 26, and it is unknown whether that will be the case.As for the broader economy, the Atlanta Fed's GDPNow tracker of incoming data puts third-quarter growth at a 4% rate. Goldman projects fourth-quarter growth of 1.3%, an upward revision of 0.3 percentage point from the prior forecast, putting the full year on pace for a 2% annualized gain.",

    "body": "Foxconn Chairman Young Liu delivers a speech during the Hon Hai Tech Day in Taipei on Oct. 18, 2023.I-hwa Cheng | AFP | Getty ImagesFoxconn, the world's largest contract electronics maker, said Wednesday that its third-quarter profit jumped 17% from a year earlier, driven by growth in its artificial intelligence server business.Here's how Foxconn did in the September quarter compared with LSEG SmartEstimates, which are weighted toward forecasts from analysts who are more consistently accurate:Revenue: $2.06 trillion New Taiwan dollars ($66.29 billion) vs. NT$2.06 trillion expectedNet profit: NT$57.67 billion vs. NT$50.41 billionFoxconn, formally known as Hon Hai Precision Industry, is best known as the world's largest manufacturer of Apple's iPhones, but has been shifting into other business avenues, including AI. The firm manufactures server racks designed for AI workloads and has become a key partner to American AI chip darling Nvidia.The company said it expects operations in the second half of the year — the traditional peak season — to maintain continuous quarterly growth, citing stronger AI server shipments and rising demand for information and communications technology products.However, Foxconn cautioned that global political and economic uncertainty, along with exchange rate fluctuations, will require continued close monitoring.Foxconn reported that its 'Cloud and Networking' segment saw strong year-on-year growth, supported by demand for AI server racks.Foxconn's server manufacturing business is currently in a strong growth phase, underpinned by robust demand, Ivan Lam, a senior analyst at Counterpoint Research, told CNBC.The company is leveraging its dominance in contract manufacturing to secure both current and future orders, Lam said, describing it as a clear case of \"follow the cash\" strategy that involves sacrificing some consumer electronics orders.He added that Foxconn's pivot toward high-growth server manufacturing \"is clearly paying off,\" even as it trades parts of its consumer electronics footprint for longer-term momentum.While component price volatility, currency swings, and logistics challenges can pressure margins, Lam said he expects Foxconn's fourth-quarter results to \"remain favorable.\"The electronics contract manufacturer also said it is partnering with Nvidia, Stellantis and Uber to build so-called \"Level 4\" autonomous vehicles, which doesn't require a safety driver to be present.Recently, Foxconn signed a memorandum of understanding with Mitsubishi Electric on Nov. 6 to jointly supply energy-efficient AI data center solutions globally. Besides AI data centers, Foxconn and Mitsubishi Electric plan to explore additional new business models and solutions using their combined technological and knowledge capabilities.",

(Photo by Huang Jingwen/Xinhua via Getty Images)Huang Jingwen | Xinhua News Agency | Getty Images  Even as a U.S.–China trade truce appears to be holding, analysts caution that the détente remains fragile in a rivalry increasingly defined by strategic competition.A flurry of decisions, outlined in the sweeping trade deal struck by U.S. President Donald Trump with Chinese leader Xi Jinping last month, took effect on Monday, with rollbacks of steep tariffs and export controls.The U.S. halved fentanyl-linked tariffs on imports from China to 10% and extended for a year a truce that lowered the reciprocal tariff rate from 34% to 10%.In return, China's Ministry of Commerce rolled back several export restrictions on critical minerals and rare earth materials to the U.S. on Monday. Those curbs, first imposed on Oct. 9, had targeted materials vital for military hardware, semiconductors, and other high-tech industries.Beijing also reversed retaliatory limits on exports of gallium, germanium, antimony, and other so-called super-hard materials such as synthetic diamonds and boron nitrides. Those measures, introduced in December 2024, were widely seen as a response to Washington's expanded semiconductor export restrictions on China. Still, Morgan Stanley economists said that Beijing has not unwound the export-control framework it introduced in April – likely to maintain a \"calibrated choke-point\" meant to preserve leverage.Given the persisting strategic rivalry, \"we view rolling negotiations, episodic flare-ups, and policy asymmetry as the new equilibrium,\" the economists said.China is also reportedly developing a so-called \"validated end-user\" system, or VEU, to block rare earth exports to companies with ties to the U.S. military, the Wall Street Journal reported Tuesday, citing unnamed sources.The system, if strictly implemented, could make it more difficult for automotive and aerospace companies with both civilian and defense clients to import certain Chinese materials, the Journal reported.Trade thawBeijing on Monday added 13 fentanyl precursors to its export control list, requiring a license for shipments to the U.S., Mexico, and Canada.The Ministry of Commerce also suspended sanctions against five U.S.-linked subsidiaries of South Korea's shipbuilder Hanwha Ocean for a year, while the Ministry of Transport paused measures targeting the U.S. shipping sector, including port fees. The U.S. Trade Representative said Sunday it would suspend its own measures for one year.watch nowAs part of the bilateral agreement, the White House said China agreed to purchase 12 million metric tons of soybeans by the end of this year and 25 million annually over the next three years. Beijing, which has not confirmed those numbers, appeared to have resumed soybean purchases from the U.S. recently, according to Reuters, after shunning them for most parts of this year.\"These steps suggest 'so far, so good,' but in reality, this is just the beginning,\" said Wendy Cutler, senior vice president at Asia Society Policy Institute. While there were incentives for both sides to keep the truce in place, such \"de-escalatory moves tend to be short-lived,\" she added.China's economy, weighed down by the prolonged trade war with Washington, grew 4.8% in the third quarter — its slowest in a year and down from 5.2% in the second quarter.In a notice Monday, China's State Council announced 13 measures to promote private investment in several major state-dominated industries.China's push for self-reliance amid \"fierce international competition\" at last month's top economic plenum was a sign that the leadership is linking growth goals more closely to strategic competition with the U.S., said Neil Thomas, a fellow on Chinese politics at the Asia Society.\"Beijing is not chasing a grand bargain [but] seeking a truce to buy time and build leverage,\" Thomas added. He added that while Washington and Beijing both prioritize self-reliance over interdependence, Xi is betting that his strategic resolve will outlast Trump's.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tWeekly analysis and insights from Asia's largest economy in your inbox\n\t\t\tSubscribe now\n\t\t\n\t",

    "body": "Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program (SNAP) signage at a grocery store in Dorchester, Massachusetts, US, on Monday, Nov. 3, 2025. Mel Musto | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesThe Supreme Court on Tuesday extended until late Thursday night a pause in a federal judge's order that the Trump administration pay full SNAP benefits for November.The two-day delay, which was objected to by Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, gives Congress time to pass a short-term funding bill that would reopen the U.S. government, which has been shut down since Oct. 1, and fund the SNAP program that provides 42 million Americans with food stamps.The Trump administration had argued in a filing Monday with the Supreme Court that the tangled legal dispute over the benefits could soon be rendered moot by Congress passing that bill this week.If the bill is approved, and SNAP benefits start flowing as normal, that would remove the justification for lawsuits demanding that they continue during the shutdown.The House of Representatives is expected to start voting on the Senate-approved bill on Wednesday afternoon, and President Donald Trump has indicated he would sign that bill.U.S. District Court for Rhode Island Judge Jack McConnell last Thursday ordered the administration to pay the full SNAP benefits, rejecting the administration's plan to pay just 65% of that aid. The administration originally planned to not pay any benefits during November despite $4.6 billion being available for that purpose from a contingency fund.McConnell directed federal officials to use not only the contingency fund, but also to use about $4 billion in funds from the Children's Nutrition Program to help pay for the full benefits, which the administration had refused to do.A federal appeals court in Boston upheld McConnell's order, but a short-term stay imposed by Justice Jackson blocked the order. That stay was due to expire on Tuesday night.In its order on Tuesday extending the stay by two days, the Supreme Court said that the administration's application for a longer-term stay of the order pending an appeal had been referred to the full court for consideration.The court said that the stay will remain in effect until 11:59 p.m. ET Thursday.Tuesday's order by the court noted that Jackson had said that she would \"deny the request for extension of the administrative stay and would deny the application.\" There was no written dissent by Jackson explaining her objection.New York Attorney General Letitia James, whose state had sued the administration in another case to compel full SNAP benefits payments during the shutdown, in a statement said, \"This decision means millions of Americans will once again be left wondering how they will feed their families.\"\"We hope to see an end to this suffering soon, as the government reopens and SNAP is once again fully funded. In the meantime, any New Yorkers who have received their November SNAP benefits should not be afraid to use them.\"",

    "body": "If I tell you that I'm a successful entrepreneur who runs a thriving business, you might picture an always-on founder who works late into the night and regularly puts in overtime. But I've built up sustainable passive income streams and work just four hours a day.As a content creator, I make videos about productivity and brand-building. I've also written three books, sell products, and offer courses and coaching. But I don't want to spend 100 hours a week working at the expense of time to travel, write, or be with my husband and two young daughters.About five years into my career, I started auditing my time to identify and reduce waste.Here are six time-wasting habits I quit so I could level up my life:1. I quit taking every meetingI live in this amazing world where lots of awesome people want to talk to me, call me, meet with me, hire me. But if I took every single meeting, I'd get nothing else done.When I get a meeting invitation, I don't just click yes right away. I look to see: Do we have an agenda? Is that agenda important to me? Have we discussed this already?If I decide a meeting doesn't align with my priorities or could be handled better with an email exchange, I let the organizer know that it wasn't a fit for my current priorities or there needed to be a more specific agenda for the time commitment. I love looking at a clean, intentional calendar every day. 2. I quit working without time blocksIf I have to do something, it's blocked off on my calendar. On a given day, I might have a two-hour block to schedule my next three months of video content creation and a two-hour block to write an article like this one.This forces me to prioritize what I'll focus on and agree to give it my full energy. I usually have no more than two, maybe three, time blocks per day so I can give everything the attention it deserves. It makes me — and my work — better.3. I quit saying yes to everythingI used to say yes to every podcast interview, coffee chat, and collaboration request. I thought that's what you had to do to build a business. But I was exhausted and my work was suffering.Now, when someone asks me to participate in something, I check if it aligns with my current goals. Last month alone, I said no to three podcast interviews that would have taken hours of prep time. I used those hours to create content for my YouTube channel and work on my next book.As a result, the people who matter most respect my time more, and I respect myself more, too.4. I quit social media scrollingAbout two years ago, I realized I was spending 90 minutes a day mindlessly scrolling Instagram and TikTok. That's 10.5 hours a week I could be writing or spending with my daughters.The first thing I did was turn off all my notifications. Then I moved social media apps off my phone's home screen so I'd have to intentionally search for them. Now my phone stays out of my bedroom at night, and the first thing I look at in the morning is a note with my goals — not Instagram.I still use social media for my business, but I'm intentional about it. I check it twice a day for 15 minutes each time, and I curate my feed to only show content that energizes me.5. I quit starting my day reactivelyI used to wake up, grab my phone, and immediately start responding to emails and texts. By 8 a.m., I was already stressed and behind.Now I start every day with what I call my three buckets: Movement: I do 20 minutes of stretching or hit the gym.Mindfulness: I journal or read for 15 minutes. Mastery: I spend 30 minutes on whatever I'm trying to master — right now, it's learning Spanish.This routine takes just over an hour, but it means I start my workday at 9 a.m. feeling energized and focused instead of frazzled. I don't check email until after I've completed all three buckets.6. I quit consuming without creatingThree years ago, I'd spend entire evenings watching YouTube videos about content creation and business strategy, but I wasn't actually creating anything myself. I felt stuck and behind.Now I have a strict rule: I don't consume any content unless I've already created something that day. Before I watch anything, I need to have written, filmed, or planned my own content first.This shift completely changed my mindset. When I do consume content now, I see it as inspiration rather than a sign I'm falling behind. Last year alone, this habit helped me publish dozens of YouTube videos and write my third book.Amy Landino is the bestselling author of Good Morning Good Life, personal brand coach and the award-winning creator of AmyTV on YouTube.

    "body": "Senator Tim Kaine (D-VA) speaks at a press conference with other Senate Democrats who voted to restore government funding, in Washington, DC on November 9, 2025. Nathan Posner | Anadolu | Getty ImagesUpdate: The Senate on Monday night passed the deal, sending the funding bill to the House.Senate Democrats are poised to help Republicans pass a bill that could lead to the end of the government shutdown. But the deal they're agreeing to doesn't directly address what was once Democrats' key demand: an extension of Affordable Care Act subsidies, which are due to expire by year's end.The Senate took a major step toward ending the shutdown on Sunday night, when eight Democrats in the narrowly divided chamber voted for a procedural motion that paves the way for approval of a negotiated funding bill.Those eight Democrats, who broke with party leadership, were just enough for the measure to hit the 60-vote threshold required to overcome the filibuster. That rule has prevented Republicans, who hold a slim majority in the Senate, from reopening the government on their own.The procedural vote's passage broke a nearly six-week logjam in which most Senate Democrats repeatedly shot down a Republican-backed bill that would temporarily resume government funding at current levels.What Democrats wantedDemocrats had demanded that any funding bill must include significant additional spending on health care protections and other key measures.Most notably, they fought for a permanent extension of enhanced tax credits under the ACA, which were introduced during the Biden administration and are set to expire by year's end. If those subsidies lapse, millions of Americans could either lose their health insurance or see their premiums rise significantly.Democrats also sought to reverse some recent cuts to Medicaid and other health programs. And they aimed to address the Trump administration's freezing of congressionally approved federal funds, which Democrats say is illegal.Update: The Senate on Monday night passed the deal, sending the funding bill to the House.What's in the funding dealThe text of the funding deal that helped spur Sunday's breakthrough leaves many of those priorities unaddressed. The 31-page bill makes no mention of the expiring Obamacare tax credits.U.S. Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-SD) looks on outside the Senate Chamber after the vote on the 40th day of the partial government shutdown, in Washington, D.C., U.S., November 9, 2025. Aaron Schwartz | ReutersInstead, the agreement includes a guarantee from Republican leadership that the Senate will vote on a health care bill drafted by Democrats before the second week of December.\"That is a big step, because otherwise there's no way for the minority to get a bill onto the floor of the U.S. Senate,\" Sen. Angus King of Maine, an independent who caucuses with the Democrats, said Sunday night after helping to broker the deal.Even if a bill to extend the tax credits passes the Senate, it would have to be taken up and passed through the GOP-led House, and then signed by President Donald Trump. House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., has not promised to bring such a bill to a vote in his chamber.The deal currently moving through the Senate also reportedly does not challenge Trump's ability to make rescissions of congressionally appropriated funds.But it does include a \"minibus\" that funds three of the 12 annual appropriations bills, and it would resume funding for the rest of the government through Jan. 30.That full-year funding would cover the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, known as SNAP or food stamps, sources familiar with the deal told NBC News. The Trump administration has said that full SNAP benefits cannot be paid during the shutdown, prompting ongoing lawsuits from Democratic state leaders.The deal would also reverse the Trump administration's shutdown-related \"reductions in force\" or layoffs of federal workers, and ensure backpay for the paychecks they missed during the shutdown.Deal divides DemocratsSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., opposed the deal.\"This health care crisis is so severe, so urgent, so devastating for families back home, that I cannot in good faith support this [continuing resolution] that fails to address the health care crisis,\" he said Sunday.U.S. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) speaks during a press conference to discuss how the ongoing government shutdown is affecting healthcare, on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C., U.S., October 29, 2025. Kylie Cooper | ReutersDistrustful Democrats had previously rejected Republicans' insistence that any negotiations on the Obamacare subsidies could only come once the government was reopened.House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., has also panned the Senate deal, and vowed to fight it if it comes to his chamber.But King, who negotiated the Sunday compromise along with Democratic Sens. Jeanne Shaheen and Maggie Hassan of New Hampshire, maintained that it was futile to keep the painful shutdown going in hopes of getting Republicans to bend on health care.\"The question was, 'Does the shutdown further the goal of achieving some needed support for the extension of the tax credits?' Our judgment was that it will not produce that result. And the evidence for that is almost seven weeks of fruitless attempts to make that happen,\" he told the press Sunday night.Read more CNBC politics coverageDemocrats win big on Election Night in key racesZohran Mamdani wins New York City mayor's race, NBC News projectsDemocratic candidate Mikie Sherrill wins New Jersey governor's race, NBC News projectsDemocrats win Virginia governor, attorney general races, NBC News projectsSNAP update: Trump admin will pay 50% of food stamp benefits in November amid shutdownTrump says he has 'no idea who' Binance's CZ is after pardoning himTrump backtracks on attending Supreme Court tariffs case argumentsThe major shift came just days after Democratic candidates trounced Republicans up and down the ballot in the first elections since Trump returned to the White House.Additionally, numerous polls have show more Americans pinning their blame for the shutdown on Trump and Republicans, rather than Democrats. Surveys have also shown most Americans supported Democrats' initial main demand of extending the health care subsidies.But the stalemate dragged on, taking an increasingly severe toll on major industries and key federal services as many government workers remain furloughed or required to work without pay.Thinned-out staffing among air traffic controllers has caused mounting flight delays and cancellations at dozens of major airports across the country.The political fallout from the Senate Democrats' shutdown shift remains to be seen. Critics were quick to accuse the Democratic defectors of folding despite holding an arguably strong position on the shutdown. But defenders of the move say it could benefit Democrats ahead of next year's midterm elections.\"With the government reopening shortly, Senate Republicans must finally come to the table — or, make no mistake, Americans will remember who stood in the way,\" Shaheen said in a statement.\"If they don't fix this, here's my prediction. They're going to look at last Tuesday's election as a good night compared to what they're going to see next year,\" Sen.

    "body": "Job seekers attend the Mega JobNewsUSA South Florida Job Fair held in the Amerant Bank Arena on September 25, 2025 in Sunrise, Florida.Joe Raedle | Getty ImagesJudging by current data, you'd think there's literally a job out there for anyone who wants one. Looking deeper under the hood, though, tells a different story.The level of job openings as reported by the Bureau of Labor Statistics for years has shown there are at least as many available positions as there are unemployed workers.But comparing the openings with actual hirings shows that not all those jobs are being filled.Not even close, in fact: Since the beginning of 2024, job openings have outnumbered job hirings by more than 2.2 million a month, according to BLS data. That points to an ongoing problem with \"ghost jobs\" that never seem to get filled.\"The U.S. labor market looks deceptively strong on paper. Millions of openings suggest opportunity, but many are illusions,\" said Jasmine Escalera, career expert at MyPerfectResume, an employment assistance platform that released a report this week on the shadow employment market. \"The ghost job economy inflates hope, wastes job seekers' time and clouds the data [that] policymakers rely on to steer the economy.\"Job openings have generally been on the decline since peaking above 12 million in March 2022, when opportunities outnumbered available workers by better than 2 to 1. In August, the latest month for which data is available because of the government shutdown, openings totaled more than 7.2 million while hires were just 5.1 million. The ratio of vacancies to workers was about even.To be sure, the picture isn't as simple as comparing the two numbers.The postings number represents the total stock of jobs, while hirings are the flow of people hired during a particular month. So a job can get posted across multiple months without being filled, but that doesn't necessarily mean the companies advertising those positions don't intend to hire someone.watch nowPotential inventoryMoreover, some companies will post jobs just to keep an inventory of potential workers for positions that may open in the future.Finally, the openings-to-hire ratio has fallen over the past few years, from 1.8 to 1 at the peak of the job opening cycle to the current level around 1.4 to 1, indicating fewer \"ghost jobs\" out there.One issue affecting the gap: the changing labor pool as the U.S. has tightened its immigration standards.Small business owners report the toughest time filling open positions since the Covid pandemic while noting that 88% of applicants for jobs lack the required skills, according to a National Federation of Independent Business report Tuesday.However, the issue has drawn more serious attention in recent months as the labor market has begun moderating and net hiring has slowed to a crawl. At the same time, official government data is unavailable due to the shutdown in Washington, D.C.Job seekers have become frustrated at not being able to find new positions. Mobility has decelerated, with the \"quits rate\" falling more than 30% from that March 2022 peak of job openings, during what was called the \"Great Resignation.\"A petition on Change.org seeking to clamp down on companies advertising ghost jobs has garnered nearly 50,000 signatures.There are real impacts on a policy level: Federal Reserve officials watch BLS job openings numbers closely for clues about how tight the labor market is, so having unreliable data clouds their vision.\"For job seekers, that means wasted time. For policymakers, it means distorted data. For employers, it raises serious credibility issues,\" Escalera said. \"Until postings more accurately reflect actual hiring, workers will continue to chase jobs that don't exist, and trust in the labor market will erode.\"",

    "body": "watch nowCNBC's Jim Cramer suggested some artificial intelligence companies might start to underperform after months of easy gains across the board, expressing concerns about OpenAI's ability to pay the billions it's committed to spend on an infrastructure buildout.\"In this kind of environment, you need to start diversifying into other growth areas, perhaps in time to keep all the king's horses and all the king's men sidelined,\" he said. \"Maybe OpenAI can come public and Humpty-Dumpty won't have a great fall, but in the meantime, it's something you need to keep an eye on.\"OpenAI has inked deals with many tech peers worth hundreds of billions, and Cramer suggested the company may have to borrow money to meet its obligations. Recent comments from OpenAI CFO Sarah Friar were worrisome, he said. At an event earlier this week, Friar floated the idea that OpenAI could use the government as a backstop to fulfill its commitments, which spooked investors — even as Friar later clarified that OpenAI is not currently seeking government funding.So far, much of the AI buildout has been fueled by cash, not debt, Cramer said. But he stressed that debt financing, rather than cash, is riskier and makes companies more vulnerable. He also warned that problems with OpenAI could spread across the industry because the company is working with so many others in the sector. He compared the situation to rise of railroads in the U.S., where some companies borrowed heavily and then went bankrupt. While he said he's not suggesting OpenAI will end up bankrupt, he wishes \"these guys would just slow down.\"Cramer suggested OpenAI enter the booming IPO market to raise billions in order to \"un-muddy the waters.\" He also said he'd like to see some \"profits from the miners and not just from those who make the Nvidia picks and the AMD shovels,\" and for speculative tech stocks to cool down.\"I'm proclaiming that for the rest of the year it's the era of investing not as if by magic, but as if by profits,\" Cramer said. \"And for that to happen there's going to be far fewer winners and a lot more losers.\"OpenAI did not immediately respond to request for comment.watch nowSign up now for the CNBC Investing Club to follow Jim Cramer's every move in the market.Disclaimer The CNBC Investing Club Charitable Trust owns shares of Nvidia.Questions for Cramer?

Trump spent the weekend at his Mar-A-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Florida.Tasos Katopodis | Getty ImagesThe U.S. and Switzerland are getting close to signing a trade deal to lower tariffs of 39% that President Donald Trump slapped on the country in August.The president confirmed on Monday that White House officials were \"working on a deal to get the tariffs a little lower.\"\"I haven't set any number, but we're going to be working on something to help Switzerland,\" he told reporters in the Oval Office.\"We hit Switzerland very hard. But we want Switzerland to remain successful,\" he added, saying the country had been a \"very good ally.\"The tariff on Swiss exports could be cut to 15%, matching the rate that was imposed on EU exports to the U.S., according to various media reports citing sources close to the talks. Bloomberg reported that a deal could be finalized within weeks.\"We are not commenting on the ongoing discussions,\" a spokesperson at Switzerland's economy ministry told CNBC, adding that Swiss Economy Minister Guy Parmelin \"is in regular contact with the relevant authorities in the U.S., including USTR Jamieson Greer.\"CNBC has contacted the White House for further comment and is awaiting a response.The duty was met with consternation in Switzerland, whose key exports include watches, jewelry, machinery, chocolate, electronics and chemical and pharmaceutical products. Shares of Swiss firms Swatch Group and Richemont traded higher at the market open on Tuesday.High-profile Swiss businesses have been outspoken on the damage the tariff was wreaking, with the CEO of Swiss luxury watchmaker Breitling telling CNBC that the duty was \"horrible\" for Switzerland.watch nowThe 39% tariff was among the highest duties that Trump levied in his sweep of global tariffs this year, with the president angered by trade imbalances with the Swiss, and multiple other countries.According to the Office of the United States Trade Representative, the U.S. goods trade deficit with Switzerland amounted to $38.5 billion last year. The Swiss government said that the trade relationship between the two was \"relatively balanced,\" according to a CNBC translation.\"The U.S. has a surplus of services exports and Switzerland does for goods exports,\" the government said in August, adding that its goods surplus is not rooted in unfair trade practices and that over 99% of U.S. goods can be imported to Switzerland without being subject to tariffs.",

    "body": "A board shows two cancelled American Airlines flights and three on time at Logan International Airport in Boston, Massachusetts, U.S., Nov. 7, 2025.   Brian Snyder | ReutersFlight disruptions that have marred air travel for millions of people in recent weeks could continue even after the government shutdown ends, airlines and the secretary of Transportation said.The Senate on Monday night passed a bill that could end the longest federal government shutdown in history, sending it to the House for a vote.But Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said Tuesday that won't be an immediate fix.\"We're going to wait to see the data on our end before we take out the restrictions in travel but it depends on controllers coming back to work,\" Duffy said at a press conference at Chicago O'Hare International Airport.Duffy also warned severe disruptions over the past few days could get much worse without a deal.The Senate vote came as staffing shortages of air traffic controllers, who are required to work without their regular paychecks in the shutdown, have delayed or canceled thousands of flights, with issues worsening in recent days. Controllers missed their second full paychecks of the shutdown this week, and some have taken up second jobs and are working with increasing levels of stress, government and union officials have said.Even if the House passes the bill that will fund the federal government through January, airlines said they will need time to readjust.Read more CNBC airline newsBoeing stems cash burn for first time since 2023 but takes $4.9 billion charge on 777X delaysAmerican Airlines is late to the luxury travel boom. Can it catch up?American Airlines hires industry veteran to lead commercial team as profits trail rivals\"Airlines' reduced flight schedules cannot immediately bounce back to full capacity right after the government reopens,\" Airlines for America, a lobbying group for airlines including Delta Air Lines, United Airlines, American Airlines and Southwest Airlines, said late Monday. \"It will take time, and there will be residual effects for days. With the Thanksgiving travel period beginning next week and the busy shipping season around the corner, the time to act is now to help mitigate any further impacts to Americans.\"Airlines will need time to reconfigure schedules and position planes and crews, something they were forced to quickly address with last week's required flight cuts.More than 5 million travelers have been affected by airline staffing issues since the shutdown began on Oct. 1, Airlines for America said . The disruptions have sent some passengers looking for alternatives, from buses to rental cars and even private jets.Last Friday, the Trump administration started requiring commercial airlines to cut 4% of their domestic flights at 40 busy U.S. airports, with larger reductions on the way if the shutdown doesn't end, as officials blamed the strain on air traffic controllers.watch nowAviation groups have said that record numbers of travelers are expected for the Thanksgiving period, with the holiday just over two weeks away.Just over 5% of the scheduled 22,811 U.S. departures were canceled on Tuesday, a relatively light day for travel generally, according to aviation data firm Cirium. That's down from an 8.7% cancellation rate on Monday, or 2,239 flights, and 2,633 cancellations on Sunday, or 10.2% of the schedule. Delays had also piled up with staffing shortages and bad weather at major hubs, including Chicago O'Hare.The shutdown, like the one in late 2018 to early 2019, has thrust aviation's strains into the spotlight. The previous shutdown, however, ended hours after a shortfall of air traffic controllers snarled air traffic in the New York area.Aviation groups on Tuesday urged lawmakers to not only end the shutdown but to provide more Department of Transportation funding to help modernize air traffic control and hire more controllers, who were in short supply even before the shutdown began.\"The government shutdown has disrupted that work and slowed the strong momentum we have built for modernization,\" the Modern Skies Coalition, which includes major airline, airport and aerospace groups such as Boeing, GE Aerospace and others, as well as labor unions, wrote in an open letter to Congress.President Donald Trump on Monday threatened to dock pay of air traffic controllers who are absent. \"All Air Traffic Controllers must get back to work, NOW!!!,\" he wrote in a post on Truth Social, adding that he would recommend $10,000 bonuses for any air traffic controllers who weren't absent during the shutdown.Duffy said he supported Trump's idea and that he was concerned about the dedication and \"patriotism\" of controllers who haven't shown up for work. \"If we have controllers who systemically weren't doing their job, we will take action,\" he said.Duffy said controllers would receive about 70% of their pay within two days of the shutdown ending.A day earlier, Nick Daniels, president of the National Air Traffic Controllers Association union, said it took about 2½ months before the workers were made whole in the shutdown that ended in 2019.Duffy said the shutdown has made air traffic controller staffing more challenging, with 15 to 20 of them retiring a day instead of around four retiring a day before the government closure. He said the country is roughly 2,000 controllers short of what the system needs.\"The job of keeping aviation safe and secure is tough every day, but forcing federal employees to do it without pay is unacceptable,\" the Modern Skies Coalition wrote in its open letter. \"We owe public servants at the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and other agencies supporting aviation, like the National Transportation Safety Board, the Transportation Security Administration and Customs and Border Protection, a debt of gratitude and a swift ending to this shutdown.\"",

    "body": "U.S. President Donald Trump hosts a bilateral lunch with Hungary's Prime Minister Viktor Orban (not pictured) at the White House in Washington, D.C., U.S., Nov. 7, 2025. Jonathan Ernst | ReutersPresident Donald Trump has doled out dozens of executive clemency grants in the past few weeks alone, issuing pardons and commutations to major business figures, political supporters and other allies.Some hope he's just getting started.Trump started wielding his presidential mercy powers aggressively on the first day of his second term, when he pardoned roughly 1,500 people who were charged in connection with the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol. Presidential pardons erase federal criminal convictions, while commutations shorten or cancel prison sentences, and sometimes related fines.In subsequent months, clemency recipients have included a slew of well-known names, including former Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich, ex-Hunter Biden business partner Devon Archer, Nikola founder Trevor Milton, reality TV stars Julie and Todd Chrisley, disgraced former U.S. Rep. George Santos and Binance founder Changpeng Zhao.On Monday, Trump granted largely symbolic pardons to more than six dozen people who were involved in efforts to overturn his loss to Joe Biden in the 2020 presidential race, U.S. pardon attorney Ed Martin revealed on social media. The people included in the batch of pardons are not facing federal charges related to the 2020 election. The presidential pardon power does not extend to state-level prosecutions.That group includes Rudy Giuliani, Trump's onetime personal lawyer and former New York City mayor, as well as his former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows.Some recipients of Trump's clemency, including multiple people involved in the Jan. 6 Capitol riot, have since been charged with new crimes.The Department of Justice's Office of the Pardon Attorney has a formal process for people to apply for clemency, and the agency has established standards for considering petitions. But Trump's White House has reportedly taken over much of the process, including by appointing a former clemency recipient, Alice Johnson, as the administration's \"pardon czar.\"Read more CNBC politics coverageDemocrats win big on Election Night in key racesZohran Mamdani wins New York City mayor's race, NBC News projectsDemocratic candidate Mikie Sherrill wins New Jersey governor's race, NBC News projectsDemocrats win Virginia governor, attorney general races, NBC News projectsSNAP update: Trump admin will pay 50% of food stamp benefits in November amid shutdownTrump says he has 'no idea who' Binance's CZ is after pardoning himTrump backtracks on attending Supreme Court tariffs case argumentsPrior presidents have been accused of misusing their clemency powers, including Biden, whose last-minute pardons for his family members and preemptive pardons for others generated bipartisan condemnations.But Trump's approach, which has at times favored famous figures and those who have heaped praise upon him, has spurred unique criticism.\"It's like a celebrity pardon-a-thon,\" John Yoo, a former George W. Bush administration official, told The Washington Post in June.It has also given rise to a cottage industry of lawyers and lobbyists who are charging steep fees to help their clients seek Trump's clemency, the online publication NOTUS reported.Trump pulled back on the pardons over the summer, after White House officials grew concerned about the efforts to profit off the process, NBC News reported last month. But the raft of clemency actions in recent weeks suggests that Trump does not currently share those concerns.That could be good news for a number of high-profile figures who have been eyed as possible candidates for pardons or commutations from Trump.Based on public reports and the president's own remarks, here's who that list might include:Ghislaine MaxwellGhislaine Maxwell on September 20, 2013 in New York City.Laura Cavanaugh | Getty ImagesThe House Judiciary Committee's Democratic minority on Monday shared \"whistleblower information\" that Maxwell, the longtime accomplice of notorious sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, is preparing a \"commutation application\" for the Trump administration.Maxwell is currently serving a 20-year prison sentence for acting as a procurer of teenage girls for Epstein. The Supreme Court in early October declined to take up Maxwell's appeal of her conviction.She \"has good reason to believe\" that she \"may receive the extraordinary grant of clemency from you,\" Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md., the committee's ranking member, accused Trump in a letter seeking answers from him.\"Feigning ignorance and distancing yourself from the situation, you have pointedly refused to rule out clemency for her,\" Raskin wrote to Trump.Trump has given ambiguous answers when asked on multiple occasions about that possibility of pardoning Maxwell.Asked on Oct. 6 if he was considering a pardon for her, Trump said, \"I haven't heard the name in so long. I can say this, that I'd have to take a look at it. I would have to take a look.\"\"I will speak to the DOJ,\" Trump said when asked to clarify if he was considering it. \"I wouldn't consider it or not consider — I don't know anything about it.\"A White House spokeswoman, in response to the whistleblower claims shared Monday, told NBC that it \"does not comment on potential clemency requests.\"\"As President Trump has stated, pardoning Ghislaine Maxwell is not something he has thought about,\" the spokeswoman said.Lauren Hersh, national director of anti-trafficking group World Without Exploitation, said in a statement Tuesday that Maxwell's sentence \"should be upheld like anyone else's.\"\"To now entertain a commutation would sadly send a clear message to survivors of her crimes — and to countless others who have been victimized sexually — that her power outweighs truth and that the justice owed to survivors can be denied,\" Hersh said.DiddySean \"Diddy\" Combs sits with his lawyers Brian Steel, and Alexandra Shapiro during a court sentencing, after the music mogul was convicted on charges of transporting prostitutes to engage in drug-fueled sexual performances, in New York City, U.S., Oct. 3, 2025 in this courtroom sketch. Jane Rosenberg | ReutersMusic mogul Sean \"Diddy\" Combs' path to clemency currently appears narrow at best.Combs was sentenced to more than four years behind bars in early October over his conviction on two prostitution-related charges.After his conviction, Combs' lawyers reached out to Trump to seek a pardon, a member of his legal team told CNN.\"It's my understanding that we've reached out and had conversations in reference to a pardon,\" attorney Nicole Westmoreland told the news outlet.Trump said in an Aug. 1 interview with Newsmax that he was leaning against pardoning Combs.On Oct. 6, Trump confirmed that Combs' team had reached out.\"A lot of people have asked me for pardons. I call him 'Puff Daddy,' [he] has asked me for a pardon,\" Trump said in the Oval Office.After TMZ reported on Oct. 20 that Trump was considering commuting Combs' sentence, the White House pushed back, calling the story false.Elizabeth HolmesFormer Theranos CEO Elizabeth Holmes alongside her boyfriend Billy Evans, walks back to her hotel following a hearing at the Robert E. Peckham U.S. Courthouse on March 17, 2023 in San Jose, California.Philip Pacheco | Getty ImagesElizabeth Holmes, the founder of Theranos, in late 2022 was sentenced to more than 11 years in prison for deceiving investors about her now-shuttered company's blood-testing technology.Trump has not commented on Holmes, and she has not explicitly pleaded for clemency, though she has maintained she was \"wrongly convicted of defrauding investors.\"Holmes is nevertheless included in the online betting site Polymarket's list of possible Trump pardon subjects, with her chances currently on par with Maxwell's.On Tuesday, Politico reported that some people who identify with the pro-Trump \"Make America Healthy Again\" movement have thrown their support behind Holmes.In late August, Holmes resumed posting on her dormant social media account on X.

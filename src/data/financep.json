    "body": "The logo of Softbank is displayed at a press briefing on Softbank's new service in Tokyo on January 15, 2018. KAZUHIRO NOGI | AFP | Getty ImagesShares in Japan's SoftBank Group closed 10% lower on Wednesday, amid a broader drop in AI-linked companies as investors turned wary of stretched valuations in the market's most crowded trade.SoftBank, which has built a broad portfolio of AI-related investments spanning infrastructure, chips, and application firms, lost about $23 billion in market cap. The group's shares clocked their worst day since April when shares plunged over 12%, data from LSEG showed.SoftBank has a controlling stake in U.K-based Arm Holdings, whose chip designs power mobile and AI processors, and acquired Ampere Computing this year to strengthen its AI data-center capabilities. Nasdaq-listed Arm Holdings saw shares drop 4.71% overnight.The group has backed leading AI model developers such as OpenAI, as well as application-level startups like OpusClip, a generative-AI video-editing platform, and Tempus AI, which applies machine learning to precision medicine.Other Japanese tech stocks also fell: semiconductor testing equipment maker Advantest declined over 5%, chipmaker Renesas Electronics lost 4.27%, Tokyo Electron, a chip production equipment maker, fell 4.08%.South Korean memory chip giants Samsung Electronics and SK Hynix lost 4.1% and 1.19% respectively. The surge in chipmakers SK Hynix and Samsung Electronics this year has helped push South Korea's Kospi Index to record highs.Taiwan's TSMC, the world's largest contract chipmaker, fell 2.99%. Alibaba declined over 3% while Tencent pared losses to trade flat.The declines come after U.S. software company Palantir dropped about 8% overnight, even after topping expectations for the third quarter, as sky-high valuations across AI sector hit investor sentiment. The AI-led rally has pushed the S&P 500's forward P/E above 23 — its highest since 2000, according to FactSet.The frenzy around AI has sparked concerns that markets could be in the midst of a tech bubble.\"There is fear of an AI correction, and if it comes, it will sweep the rest of the market with it due to the heavy weight of the leading names,\" market veteran Louis Navellier wrote in a note.Some analysts say valuations of AI companies increasingly resemble the dot-com boom of the late 1990s, with share prices soaring far ahead of credible profit expectations.watch nowJared Bernstein, who headed the Council of Economic Advisers during the Joe Biden administration, noted that the share of the economy devoted to AI investment is almost a third higher than during the internet bubble, adding that the gap between earnings potential and spending \"certainly looks bubbly.\"Michael Burry, famed for predicting the 2008 financial crisis, has also stirred controversy with his bet against AI darlings Palantir and Nvidia. In a recent filing, Burry's Scion Asset Management revealed significant short positions on these firms, which are at the forefront of AI and chip technology.Besides Palantir, other U.S. tech majors also fell overnight: Oracle lost 4%, Chipmaker AMD dropped nearly 4%, while Nvidia and Amazon also declined.\"In my view, [the selloff] is short lived. I don't believe this is a start of a more structural sell off,\" said Dan Ives, managing director and senior equity research analyst at Wedbush. \"I think it's just a lot of nervous, sort of white knuckles and the selloff that we saw ... along with the selloff that we've seen crypto and others, it was just a massive risk off.\"",

    "body": "AMD CEO Lisa Su speaks at a Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee hearing in Washington on May 8, 2025. The leaders of some of the biggest technology and artificial intelligence companies will go to Congress on Thursday with a wish list of sorts that at its top has doing away with regulation they say inhibits their firms' growth and by default, sends business to China.Nathan Howard | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesAdvanced Micro Devices reported fiscal third-quarter results that exceeded Wall Street expectations, but gave margin guidance was inline with estimates. The stock fell almost 5% in extended trading.Here's how the company did in comparison with LSEG consensus:Earnings per share: $1.20 adjusted vs. $1.16 expectedRevenue: $9.25 billion vs. $8.74 billion expectedRevenue increased 36% from a year earlier in the fiscal third quarter, which ended on Sept. 27, according to a statement.Net income climbed to $1.24 billion, or 75 cents per share, from $771 million, or 47 cents per share, a year earlier.For the fourth quarter, AMD expects about $9.6 billion in revenue, implying 25% growth. That's above LSEG's $9.15 billion consensus. AMD sees an adjusted gross margin of 54.5% for the quarter, meeting StreetAccount's consensus of 54.5%.AMD, which is trying to keep pace with Nvidia in the market for artificial intelligence processors, said the guidance does not include revenue from shipments of its Instinct MI308 chips to China. Executives said the same thing last quarter. This time, though, AMD indicated that revenue from those chips could be coming.\"We have received some licenses for MI308, so we're appreciative of the administration supporting some licenses for MI308,\" AMD CEO Lisa Su told analysts on a conference call. \"We're still working with our customers on the demand environment and sort of what the overall opportunity is.\"As of Tuesday's close, AMD shares were up 107% so far this year, while the Nasdaq is up 21%.AMD reached a deal with OpenAI last month that could see the AI startup company take a 10% stake in the chipmaker. OpenAI will deploy 6 gigawatts of AMD's Instinct graphics processing units over multiple years and across multiple generations of hardware, the companies said, beginning with an initial 1-gigawatt rollout of chips in the second half of next year.For years OpenAI and other companies relied on graphics chips from Nvidia for running large-scale AI models.\"We expect this partnership will significantly accelerate our data center AI business with the potential to generate well over $100 million in revenue over the next few years,\" Su said. The AI business is on a path toward generating tens of billions in annual revenue in 2027, she said.Also in October, Oracle announced plans to deploy 50,000 AMD Instinct MI450 AI chips in its cloud starting next year.AMD's data center business, which includes standard central processing units and GPUs for AI, generated $4.34 billion in fiscal third-quarter revenue, up 22%. Analysts polled by StreetAccount were looking for $4.13 billion.Client revenue reached $2.75 billion, which was up 46% and more than StreetAccount's $2.61 billion consensus. Revenue from gaming totaled $1.30 billion, up 181%. StreetAccount's consensus was $1.05 billion.Microsoft and Sony ramped up production of their respective Xbox and PlayStation video game consoles ahead of the holiday season, leading to growth in semi-custom chip revenue for AMD, Su said.Amazon, a key cloud customer for AMD, disclosed in a Tuesday filing that it had sold all 822,234 of its AMD shares as of Sept. 30. Amazon built the position sometime in the first quarter.WATCH: AMD CEO on new $1 billion AI supercomputer partnership with the Department of Energywatch now",

    "body": "Fire and smoke mark where a UPS cargo plane crashed near Louisville Muhammad Ali International Airport on Nov. 4, 2025 in Louisville, Kentucky. Stephen Cohen | Getty ImagesA UPS cargo plane crashed shortly after taking off from Louisville Muhammad Ali International Airport in Kentucky at around 5:15 p.m. local time Tuesday, the Federal Aviation Administration said.At least seven people were killed, Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear said on X, adding that the death toll is expected to rise. In an earlier press conference, he also said 11 people were injured in the incident, some of them significantly.UPS said in a statement that there were three crewmembers on the plane. It was unclear if the fatalities were from the plane or on the ground, and Beshear said the status of the crew was unknown. He added that there was an emergency response area set up for families.The reason for the crash was not immediately known. The plane was a MD-11F, a type of freight transport aircraft made by aircraft manufacturer McDonnell Douglas, which merged with Boeing in 1997. The plane had hundreds of thousands of pounds of fuel on board to travel all the way to Honolulu, Louisville Fire Chief Brian O'Neill said in the press conference.The Louisville Metro Police Department said on X that it was implementing a shelter-in-place order near the crash site. Several businesses near the area were affected, officials said.There was no hazardous material on the plane that would create an environmental issue, but the place where it crashed \"could create those types of situations,\" Beshear said. He said a petroleum recycling business and an an auto parts business are in the area and called it an \"all-hands on deck response.\"A plume of smoke wafts over airport property after reports of a plane crash at Louisville International Airport, Tuesday, Nov. 4, 2025, in Louisville, Ky.Jon Cherry | APA large plume of black smoke was visible near the airport, and footage from local TV showed fire and debris in a large radius around the crash site.The National Transportation Safety Board announced it is sending an investigation team to the incident site Wednesday.The airport was closed following the incident, and \"all arriving and departing flights at SDF are temporarily suspended,\" the airport said in a statement on X Tuesday evening.The airport is home to the UPS Worldport, which the company says is its largest package handling facility in the world.\"We are terribly saddened by the accident tonight in Louisville. Our heartfelt thoughts are with everyone involved. UPS is committed to the safety of our employees, our customers and the communities we serve,\" the company said in a statement. \"This is particularly true in Louisville, home to our airline and thousands of UPSers.\"Hundreds of UPS flights take off daily from Louisville, according to the company. UPS noted late Tuesday that it has halted package sorting operations at the facility.\"This is a UPS town,\" said Louisville city council member Betsy Ruhe.— CNBC's Dennis Green contributed to this report.",

    "body": "Pedestrians carry Cava bags along Wall Street near the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York, US, on Monday, Aug. 18, 2025. Michael Nagle | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesCava on Tuesday cut its full-year forecast for the second straight quarter as younger consumers visit its restaurants less frequently.\"When you look at different age demographics of fast casual, the 25- to 34-year-old consumer seems to be impacted a bit more than others, and fast casual tends to have a higher concentration of those consumers within their guest portfolio,\" CFO Tricia Tolivar said in an interview, adding that the company saw demand fall as it entered the final quarter of the year.She attributed the pullback from younger consumers to the demographic's higher unemployment rate, plus a higher likelihood of facing the student loan repayments that resumed in the spring. Moreover, tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump \"created an overall fog for the consumer,\" according to Tolivar.Fast-casual rival Chipotle Mexican Grill reported similar behavior from the same age cohort when it released its third-quarter earnings on Wednesday.For 2025, Cava is now projecting that its same-store sales will increase 3% to 4%, down from its prior outlook of 4% to 6% growth. The company also expects lower restaurant-level profit margins, decreasing its projections to a range of 24.4% to 24.8%, down from the previous forecast of 24.8% to 25.2%.Cava shares fell 5% in extended trading. As of Tuesday's close, the stock has tumbled 54% this year.Here's what the company reported for the quarter ended Oct. 5 compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:Earnings per share: 12 cents adjusted, in line with expectationsRevenue: $292.2 million vs. $292.6 million expectedCava's same-store sales rose 1.9%, falling short of Wall Street's expectations of 2.8%, according to StreetAccount estimates. The chain's traffic was flat compared with the year-ago period, but menu price increases and a higher mix of premium protein options boosted sales.Despite slower same-store sales growth, Cava is gaining market share, according to Tolivar. That fact suggests that consumers who are 25- to 34-years old may be cooking at home or packing their lunches, rather than trading down to fast food.\"It appears that the consumer is being more thoughtful around their dining occasions, and how frequently they are doing that,\" Tolivar said.Unlike Chipotle and the broader restaurant industry, Cava is seeing higher same-store sales growth from low-income consumers; Tolivar credited the chain's choice to keep its menu prices below inflation, presenting a more affordable option for budget-conscious consumers.Cava's net sales climbed 20% to $292.2 million, fueled by new restaurant openings. Since the third quarter of last year, Cava has opened a net 74 locations, bringing its total footprint up to 415, as of Oct. 5.The Mediterranean chain reported fiscal third-quarter net income of $14.7 million, or 12 cents per share, down from $18 million, or 15 cents per share, a year earlier.Excluding executive transition costs and other items, Cava earned 12 cents per share.",

Jonathan Ernst | ReutersThe ongoing U.S. government shutdown is about to become the nation's longest federal funding lapse ever.The shutdown is poised to hit that milestone on Wednesday, marking its 36th day and surpassing the previous record, which was set in early 2019.The latest attempt to break the logjam, by getting a Republican-backed stopgap measure passed by Congress, failed in the Senate for the 14th time on Tuesday.There are no further votes scheduled Tuesday on the GOP's short-term continuing resolution, or on an alternative proposal put forward by Democrats, which includes additional spending on health care and other priorities.Both of the longest government shutdowns in U.S. history occurred while President Donald Trump was in office.The funding dispute centers on enhanced tax credits for insurance premiums under the Affordable Care Act, which are set to expire by year's end, threatening to significantly hike health care costs for millions of Americans. Democrats have refused to vote for any \"clean\" stopgap resolution that does not address those subsidies. Republicans have rejected the prospect of negotiating while the government remains shut down. While Republicans hold a narrow majority in the Senate, they need Democratic votes to overcome the chamber's 60-vote threshold.Some Republicans on Tuesday said they have grown \"optimistic\" that the shutdown could end this week.Sen. Mike Rounds, R-S.D., told reporters that he believes Democrats will be more open to cutting a deal after breaking the shutdown length record and after Tuesday's elections are complete.They will be able to tell their constituents \"we're fighting the President, and I think that's a major part of what this is about,\" Rounds said. Sen. Markwayne Mullin, R-Okla., said he was \"pretty confident\" the shutdown would end in the coming days.But some Democrats have poured cold water on the prospect of a coming compromise.\"There seems to be some indication of a thaw, but I see no immediate solution on the horizon,\" Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., said.\"Talks are a good thing, but so far, I sense no willingness on the part of Republicans to really assure the American people that health care insurance will be guaranteed,\" he said.Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., asked about Republicans' optimism, said, \"That would be nice. I hope that means Republicans are coming to the table to negotiate with Democrats, because so far, they have come to the table to negotiate exactly zero times.\" This is developing news.

In Pennsylvania, voters kept three incumbent Democrats on the state Supreme Court, preserving their party's 5-2 majority, NBC News projected.Even before all of the races were called, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, touted their outcomes as a sharp rebuke to President Donald Trump, a Republican.Trump, in a social media post, said that unnamed \"pollsters\" concluded that the reason Republicans lost on Tuesday was because he was not on the ballots, and because of the ongoing federal government shutdown, which began on Oct. 1.Read more CNBC politics coverageDemocrats win big on Election Night in key racesZohran Mamdani wins New York City mayor's race, NBC News projectsDemocratic candidate Mikie Sherrill wins New Jersey governor's race, NBC News projectsDemocrats win Virginia governor, attorney general races, NBC News projectsSNAP update: Trump admin will pay 50% of food stamp benefits in November amid shutdownTrump says he has 'no idea who' Binance's CZ is after pardoning himTrump backtracks on attending Supreme Court tariffs case argumentsSchumer, who refused to endorse Mamdani before Election Day, in a statement, said, \"Tonight's results are a repudiation of the Trump agenda.\"\"The cruelty, chaos, and greed that define MAGA radicalism and are skyrocketing costs were firmly rejected by the American people,\" Schumer said.Schumer said it was \"a good night for Democrats and our fight to lower costs, improve healthcare, and reach a better future for American families.\"\"If Republicans want to keep blindly following Donald Trump into the abyss of chaos, let them,\" Schumer said. \"The rest of America is moving forward.\"Jones, the projected winner of the Virginia attorney general's race, unlike the other Democrats who won big was not seen as a betting favorite going into the night.Jones' fate in the race looked at serious risk in October after the disclosure of text messages he sent in 2022 that showed him fantasizing about shooting then-state House Speaker Todd Gilbert, a Republican.",

Graeme Sloan | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesIn Virginia's closely watched gubernatorial race, Democrats appear to have benefited from a small but decisive bloc of voters who harbor unfavorable views of both major political parties, according to NBC News exit polls.That Democratic advantage there among disaffected voters mirrors trends seen in other contests Tuesday, including the New Jersey governor's race and the New York City mayoral election, NBC reported.In Virginia, 41% of voters said that they had a favorable view only of the Democratic Party, and another 41% favorably viewed only the Republican Party, according to NBC's poll.But 10% said they viewed neither party favorably.And among that group, 72% backed Democrat nominee Abigail Spanberger over Republican nominee Winsome Earle-Sears, who drew just 23%, NBC found.The findings come despite recent data showing a decline in Democratic voter registrations and a slide in the party's favorability ratings nationwide.",

Deep tech startups are an umbrella term for emerging companies in semiconductors, space, AI, biotech, robotics, and energy.The world's most valuable company will offer technical talks and training through its Nvidia Deep Learning Institute to emerging startups in India.Nvidia wants to \"provide guidance on AI systems, developer enablement, and responsible deployment, and to collaborate with policymakers, investors, and entrepreneurs,\" Vishal Dhupar, Nvidia's managing director of South Asia, said.Nvidia did not disclose any financial investment, timeline, or training targets, and did not immediately respond to a CNBC request for comment.\"Nvidia's depth of expertise in AI systems, software, and ecosystem-building will benefit our network of investors and entrepreneurs,\" said Sriram Viswanathan, founding executive council member of the IDTA.He told CNBC that the pace of innovation is accelerating in India and there could be a \"significant number of Indian deep tech companies of global repute\" in the next five years.The Indian government is also actively encouraging research and innovation in the deep tech space through major initiatives, including over 100 billion rupees ($1.1 billion USD) under its AI Mission and a separate 1 trillion rupees ($11.2 billion) Research, Development and Innovation Scheme Fund targeting deep tech companies.On Monday, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced that the country will host the AI Impact Summit in February next year.The event is likely to see the participation of heads of state and top policymakers, along with business leaders such as Jensen Huang, chief executive officer of NVIDIA, and Demis Hassabis, CEO of Google DeepMind.Nvidia's commitment in India coincides with rising global interest in India's AI market, where OpenAI counts the country as its second-largest user base. U.S. rivals are also deepening ties: Google recently pledged $15 billion to build an AI hub in the southern city of Visakhapatnam.",

    "body": "watch nowPalantir CEO Alex Karp ranted against short sellers, calling out specifically Michael Burry after a filing revealed the investor of \"The Big Short\" fame had bets against the artificial intelligence software company, as well as Nvidia, at the end of the last quarter.\"The two companies he's shorting are the ones making all the money, which is super weird,\" Karp told CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" on Tuesday. \"The idea that chips and ontology is what you want to short is bats--- crazy.\"\"He's actually putting a short on AI. ... It was us and Nvidia,\" Karp added.When reached via email by CNBC seeking comment on Karp's remarks, Burry declined to comment.Palantir shares slid 8% on Tuesday even after the software company beat Wall Street estimates for the third quarter and offered upbeat guidance. Investors have grown increasingly wary of lofty valuations in AI-linked names. Palantir's stock, which was up 173% for the year heading into Tuesday's trading, has a forward price-earnings ratio of 228. Nvidia fell 4% after gaining over 50% this year.\"I do think this behavior is egregious and I'm going to be dancing around when it's proven wrong,\" said Karp of short sellers.Burry's hedge fund, Scion Asset Management, disclosed put options with a notional value of about $187 million against Nvidia and $912 million against Palantir as of Sept. 30. in a filing. The filing didn't specify the strike prices or expiration dates of the contracts.It's unclear whether Burry is profiting from Tuesday's declines. The filing reflects his positions at the end of September, and he may have since adjusted his portfolio by now. Burry declined to comment on his positions.\"It's not even clear he's shorting us. It's probably just, 'How do I get my position out and not look like a fool?'\" Karp said.The disclosure comes after Burry hinted at renewed caution in markets in a cryptic post on X last week.\"Sometimes, we see bubbles. Sometimes, there is something to do about it. Sometimes, the only winning move is not to play,\" he wrote to his 1.3 million followers on the platform.Burry gained fame for his prescient bet against mortgage-backed securities before the 2008 financial crisis, a trade chronicled in Michael Lewis' book \"The Big Short\" and the Oscar-winning film of the same name.\"With the shorts it's very complex ... honestly I think what's going on here is market manipulation,\" Karp said. \"We delivered the best results anyone's ever seen. It's not even clear he's not doing this to get out of his position. I mean these people, they claim to be ethical, but they are actually shorting one of the great businesses of the world.\"",

    "body": "A volunteer displays information on the Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program (SNAP) at a grocery store in Dorchester, Massachusetts, US, on Monday, Nov. 3, 2025. Mel Musto | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesPresident Donald Trump on Tuesday suggested that the United States would not pay any SNAP benefits during the government shutdown, contradicting a court filing a day earlier by his administration.Trump said that the benefits, which help feed 42 million Americans, will resume only after Democrats in Congress agree to pass a stopgap funding bill that would reopen the government.The administration on Monday told a federal judge in Rhode Island that it would pay half of the costs of the SNAP benefits for November.Trump on Tuesday said in a Truth Social post, \"SNAP BENEFITS, which increased by Billions and Billions of Dollars (MANY FOLD!) during Crooked Joe Biden's disastrous term in office (Due to the fact that they were haphazardly 'handed' to anyone for the asking, as opposed to just those in need, which is the purpose of SNAP!), will be given only when the Radical Left Democrats open up government, which they can easily do, and not before!\"The White House, when asked by CNBC for clarification on Trump's statement given the court filing Monday, said, \"Refer you to the President's truth.\"White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt, at a briefing later, told reporters that \"the administration is fully complying with the court order.\"Leavitt said she had spoken to Trump about his post, and added, \"The recipients of these SNAP benefits need to understand it's going to take some time to receive this money, because the Democrats have forced the administration into a very untenable position.\"\"We are digging into a contingency fund that is supposed to be for emergencies, catastrophes, for war, and the president does not want to have to tap into this fund in the future, and that's what he was referring to in his Truth Social post,\" Leavitt said.She also said that the U.S. Department of Agriculture had issued guidance on Tuesday to individual states about the amount of money being disbursed to SNAP recipients.The social media post came shortly after lawyers for plaintiffs in a court case challenging the administration's cessation of SNAP benefits told a federal judge in Rhode Island that the decision to pay partial benefits out of a contingency fund did not meet his prior order that any decision to make partial payments \"cannot be arbitrary and capricious.\"The judge, Jack McConnell, had told the administration on Friday that it needed to pay SNAP benefits as soon as possible out of a contingency fund, and that is also needed to investigate whether other federal funds could be used to keep the program fully funded in the absence of a new appropriation by Congress.Read more CNBC government shutdown coverage Government shutdown could cost U.S. economy up to $14 billion, CBO saysJudge extends ban on Trump firing federal workers during government shutdownStates sue Trump admin to keep SNAP benefits during government shutdownLargest federal worker union urges end to government shutdownTrump's $130 million mystery military donor is Timothy Mellon: NYTGovernment shutdown becomes second-longest in U.S. historyStates sue Trump administration to keep SNAP benefits Government shutdown becomes 2nd longest in U.S. historyHow to get student loan help during the government shutdownWhite House economic advisor Hassett says shutdown could end this weekArmy Corps of Engineers pausing $11 billion in projects over shutdown: VoughtGovernment shutdown: Trump distrust keeps Democrats from forming 'gang'Bill to fund military during government shutdown fails in Senate procedural voteThe Trump administration on Monday told McConnell that it would use all of the $4.65 billion remaining in the contingency fund, but said it had declined to use at least $4 billion from the Child Nutrition Program to keep SNAP fully funded for November, at least.Lawyers for plaintiffs in the case told McConnell on Tuesday, \"The Court should grant a temporary restraining order and preliminary stay on the ground that Defendants' decision not to provide full SNAP benefits — even though they have funds available to do so and even though switching to partial payments at this late date will cause devastating delay — is arbitrary and capricious.\"McConnell later told the Trump administration to respond to the request by Wednesday.The dispute over the continuation of the SNAP benefits in the past week has become a major issue in the ongoing U.S. government shutdown, which began Oct. 1.Past presidential administrations have continued disbursing funds for SNAP during prior government shutdowns.But the Trump administration recently said SNAP benefits would end this week because Congress had not approved funding needed to continue the program during the shutdown. The administration, in what is seen as an effort to pressure Democrats in Congress to vote to end the shutdown, also refused to use more than $4 billion in contingency funds that Congress had set aside explicitly for SNAP.Separate groups of plaintiffs then sued the Department of Agriculture in different federal courts to compel the department to continue paying the benefits.",

The report comes about two weeks after Super Micro issued preliminary earnings and said it expected revenue of $5 billion for the quarter, down from prior guidance of $6 billion to $7 billion.Net income fell by more than half to $168.3 million, or 26 cents a share, from $424.3 million, or 67 cents a share, a year earlier.In its partial report last month, Super Micro said \"design win upgrades\" pushed some expected first-quarter revenue to the second quarter. The company said it now expects sales of $10 billion to $11 billion in the current quarter, above the $7.83 billion average estimate, according to LSEG.Super Micro has been a big beneficiary of the artificial intelligence boom, as its servers come packed with graphics processing units from Nvidia.

    "body": "A box of Ozempic sits on a table in North Tyneside, Britain, Oct. 31, 2023.Lee Smith | ReutersDanish pharmaceutical giant Novo Nordisk said Wednesday it is trimming its growth expectations for its leading obesity and diabetes treatments as competition intensifies and pricing pressures mount in the weight loss market.Net profit for the quarter came in at 20 billion Danish kroner ($3.1 billion) in line with the 20.12 billion Danish kroner anticipated by analysts in a FactSet poll.Diabetes and obesity care were a key growth driver following the uptake of Wegovy and Ozempic, however the company lowered its expectations for growth, citing prescription trends, competition and pricing pressure.Novo shares fell 4.5% at the opening bell on Wednesday, before reversing course to trade 1.8% higher at 8:15 a.m. in London (4:15 a.m. ET). They are down 44.8% year-to-date.Novo narrowed its full-year guidance for the fourth time this year, saying it now expects sales growth within the range of 8% to 11% at constant exchange rates, compared to a previous forecast of 8% to 14%. It also lowered its expectations for operating profit growth of 4% to 10% to a new forecast of 4% to 7%.Sales of its blockbuster weight loss drug Wegovy rose 18% year-on-year to hit 20.35 billion Danish kroner in the three months to September, slightly below the 21.35 billion kroner expected by analysts.Operating profit for the first nine months of 2025 came in 10% higher compared to the same period the year prior, at 95.9 billion kroner, though the company noted that this would have increased by 21% if it wasn't for restructuring costs of around 9 billion kroner.watch now\"While we delivered robust sales growth in the first nine months of 2025, the lower growth expectations for our GLP-1 treatments have led to a narrowing of our guidance,\" Mike Doustdar, president and CEO said in a statement.\"We aim to accelerate on all fronts to be able to compete better in dynamic and increasingly competitive markets,\" he added, noting the acquisition of Akero Therapeutics Inc. and progress testing another weight management drug.Novo's Copenhagen-listed shares have tumbled more than 50% over the course of this year, as a slew of headwinds has shaken investor confidence in what was once Europe's most valuable firm.Alongside a series of disappointing trial results, increasing competition in the obesity drug space and challenges arising from U.S. policies on drug pricing and tariffs, Novo has been contending with leadership shakeups and pushback against a key acquisition.Analysts, as a result, have been mixed on the stock. Jefferies recently cut its rating to underperform while Berenberg is positive on the stock, saying Novo has hit \"peak uncertainty.\"\"Novo's superior growth profile and best-in-class R&D returns warrants a higher valuation premium to its peers,\" the bank said.Metsera bidNovo launched a rival bid to acquire American obesity biotech firm Metsera last week, superseding an offer for the firm from U.S. pharma giant Pfizer. On Monday, Pfizer said it had filed a second lawsuit against Novo and Metsera, arguing that Novo's bid for the smaller company was anticompetitive.A spokesperson for Novo said in a statement that Pfizer's allegations were \"false and without merit.\"Novo then ramped up its bid for Metsera on Tuesday, saying it was now offering up to $10 billion compared to the earlier offer of around $9 billion.\"Novo Nordisk believes that the proposal, including the structure of the transaction, complies with all applicable laws and is in the best interest of patients who will benefit from our commitment to innovation, as well as Metsera's shareholders,\" the company said in a statement, noting that the deal was also subject to the term's of Pfizer's merger agreement with Metsera.Metsera said on Tuesday that the revised offer was \"superior\" to a revised bid made by Pfizer.",

    "body": "Nikolas Kokovlis | Nurphoto | Getty ImagesPinterest shares tanked nearly 20% on Tuesday after the company reported third-quarter financial results that missed on earnings per share and provided weak guidance.Here's how the company did, compared to analysts' consensus estimates from LSEG:Earnings per share: 38 cents adjusted vs. 42 cents expectedRevenue: $1.05 billion vs. $1.05 billion expectedPinterest's third-quarter sales grew 17% year over year while net income was $92.11 million, up 201% from $30.56 million a year ago during the same period.The company said fourth-quarter revenue will come in between $1.31 billion and $1.34 billion. The midpoint of the revenue outlook, $1.325 billion, trailed Wall Street's projections of $1.34 billion.After the stock move in extended-trading on Tuesday, Pinterest erased its gains for the year.Pinterest said it recorded 600 million global monthly active users in the third quarter, ahead of the 590 million that StreetAccount was projecting. In August, Pinterest reported 578 million monthly active users for the second quarter.The company logged $306 million in third-quarter adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or EBIDTA. That was higher than StreetAccount's estimates of $295 million.Third-quarter sales in the U.S. and Canada came in at $786 million, lower than StreetAccount's estimates of $799 million.Pinterest's third-quarter global average revenue per user was $1.78 and less than the $1.79 that StreetAccount was projecting.\"Our investments in AI and product innovation are paying off,\" Pinterest CEO Bill Ready said in a statement. \"We've become a leader in visual search and have effectively turned our platform into an AI-powered shopping assistant for 600 million consumers.\"Pinterest finance chief Julia Donnelly said during an earnings call that the company experienced some \"pockets of moderating ad spend\" in the U.S. and Canada regions during the third quarter. Donnelly attributed the sales moderation to unspecified \"larger U.S. retailers\" that are dealing with tariff-related issues putting pressure on their margins.Regarding the company's fourth-quarter guidance, Donnelly said that \"we see these broader trends and market uncertainty continuing with the addition of a new tariff in Q4 impacting the home furnishing category.\" President Donald Trump said in September that the White House would impose 10% tariffs on imported timber and lumber and 25% duties on kitchen cabinets, bathroom vanities and related furniture.Tech giants Meta, Alphabet and Amazon reported their most recent quarterly earnings last week. Those reports showed strong digital advertising sales amid their big spending for artificial intelligence infrastructure.Meta said that its third-quarter revenue, of which 98% is derived from online ads, soared 26% year-over-year to $51.24 billion, representing the company's strongest year-over-year sales growth since the first quarter of 2024.Sales in Amazon's online ad unit rose 24% year-over-year to $17.7 billion, which was a faster growth rate than the tech giant's AWS cloud computing unit.Alphabet reported $74.18 billion in total advertising sales for the third quarter, which was a nearly 13% increase from $65.85 billion a year ago. The company's YouTube unit saw third-quarter online revenue jump 15% increase to $10.26 billion.Reddit reported third-quarter earnings last Thursday and said sales ballooned 68% year-over-year to $585 million while global daily active uniques were up 19% year-over-year to 116 million, topping estimates of 114 million. Snap reports its quarterly results on Wednesday.WATCH: Final Trades: Meta, S&P Global and Idexx Lab.watch now",

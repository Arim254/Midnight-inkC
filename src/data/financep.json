    "body": "It's a sunny, 70-degree February afternoon in Los Angeles, and crowds have been pouring into Sydney Wayser and Isaac Watters' home nonstop.A stereo system filters music into their kitchen, dining area and through the open doors to their backyard, where dozens of people sip coffees, chat in groups or type away on their laptops.The couple isn't just entertaining friends and family. Wayser, 39, and Watters, 42, are the creators behind LA's hottest new coffee shop, Granada, which the married couple runs out of their own home in Echo Park's Angelino Heights.Just over a month into their venture, they say they're having their busiest day yet.Like usual, they opened their doors at 9 a.m. Within hours they sold out of their pastry selection, had to DoorDash additional milk and called on a neighbor to go for an ice run. It's 2:30 p.m. by the time I arrive, 30 minutes to close, and there's still a line to order.The fact that the home-based cafe has been such a hit in a town with \"so many phenomenal coffee shops\" is still a shock to Wayser, who says they \"didn't expect this at all.\"\"I think that people really want community,\" she says. \"My guess is the part that feels so special is just the private intimacy of being in a house.\"Granada is one of the latest small businesses to open through California's Microenterprise Home Kitchen Operation, or MEHKO, program, which allows residents to make and sell food from their home. Given the cafe's instant success, more Angelenos could be opening their own micro-restaurants soon, meaning the new hottest place to hang out could literally be in your own backyard.A home-based coffee shop takes shapeWayser and Watters first heard about the MEHKO program last summer thanks to reporting from KCRW and The New York Times. The program was introduced in California in 2019 and authorized in LA County in 2024.Wayser says she didn't think much of it at first. Then, she became fixated.The couple had regularly attended a neighbor's family-style dinner hosted from their garage during the pandemic, which Wayser says felt like a home-based pop-up restaurant. They'd also specifically designed their own home, which they bought in 2019, for entertaining.Sydney Wayser and Isaac Watters opened Granada, a coffee shop they run from their home, in January.Talitha BullockAs a new mom, Wayser says she was figuring out how to spend her days with her 3-year-old daughter heading to preschool. As a musician, artist and designer, she was eager to find a new way to put her skills to use, especially with her work in film and TV up in the air as the industry struggles.Wayser says she's spent her career producing shows, planning events, managing business finances and running an LLC for her creative work. When she thinks about it, \"I have been an entrepreneur my whole life,\" she says. \"I just didn't really put it together, because it's always been my art.\"She and her husband, a fellow musician and visual artist, have collaborated on design projects throughout their relationship, including their home. Running a coffee shop together sounded like a fun new experiment.The couple spent months going through the process of getting a MEHKO permit, which includes food safety certification, business licensing and inspection from LA County's Department of Public Health. They say the $597 application review fee was waived because they were among the first 1,000 businesses in the program. The annual health permit for MEHKO businesses, which covers annual inspections and enforcement, costs $347.The MEHKO program sets a cap on gross annual sales of $100,000; businesses are limited to 30 meals per day or 90 per week. MEHKO operators can also be approved to serve as a commissary for up to two food carts, which would expand the amount of meals they can serve per week and also bump their gross annual sales max to $150,000 per year.I can imagine there are a lot of really qualified people that feel unqualified, and it's cool that this lets you just try something [and] see how it works.Sydney Wayserco-founder of GranadaThroughout the fall, Wayser and Watters got to work outfitting their home kitchen with espresso machines, additional dining and seating areas, custom ceramics from local artist Amy Louise Johnson and new artwork fit for a modern cafe. They asked a friend to refer them to a \"coffee wizard\" and teamed up Chad Aaron to create their coffee menu; they also tapped local baker Sasha Piligian for their pastry selection.Granada officially opened its doors in January 2026.An emerging neighborhood hot spotBecause of the limitations around MEHKO, skyrocketing sales isn't the goal for Granada. Wayser says they'll consider shortening their hours or limiting days of service in order to stay in operation for a longer stretch throughout the year.Other than potentially launching a coffee cart or two to raise their MEHKO sales cap, Wayser says they don't expect to open a commercial coffee shop. \"As soon as you're in a commercial space and your rent is so high, it's not about community anymore,\" she says. \"The reason this works is that you can buy something or not. You can hang out in the yard as long as you want. We will be paying our mortgage no matter what.\"Granada offers a menu of classic espresso drinks, teas, and pastries sourced from local baker Sasha Piligian.Oscar Mendoza, Talitha Bullock, Amber CanterburyWayser says Granada's visibility could bring new business opportunities, like courting clients to host private events, concerts and art shows from their home.She also hopes the coffee shop's success inspires other people to strike out on their own. There are currently about 265 MEHKO-permitted operations throughout LA County.Wayser says that while the program wasn't necessarily designed to encourage new parents, specifically new moms, to start a business, it's had that effect on her. \"There aren't very many things where you're able to start a new business in such short time period\" or around a condensed schedule, like the typical school day, she says.\"I can imagine there are a lot of really qualified people that feel unqualified, and it's cool that this lets you just try something [and] see how it works,\" she says, adding that the stakes are lower without having to rent out commercial space.She's already heard from one inspired friend.\"Our neighbor just today said that maybe he'll apply for MEHKO and start making sandwiches and serve [them] out his window, which would be really fun,\" Wayser says. \"This would become MEHKO Alley.\"Want to improve your communication, confidence and success at work?

    "body": "ConocoPhillips Co. signage is displayed on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York, U.S., on Friday, Nov. 4, 2016.Michael Nagle | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesAs stock markets continue to be volatile, investors looking for a stable income stream can bolster their portfolios with the addition of attractive dividend stocks. Selecting good dividend stocks from a vast universe of companies can be challenging. In this regard, recommendations of top Wall Street analysts can help investors make the right choice, as these experts assign buy ratings after a thorough analysis of a company's fundamentals and its ability to consistently pay dividends. Here are three dividend-paying stocks that are highlighted by Wall Street's top pros, as tracked by TipRanks, a platform that ranks analysts based on their past performance.Ares Capital This week's first dividend pick is Ares Capital (ARCC), a business development company that offers comprehensive financing solutions to the middle-market. Recently, the company announced better-than-expected fourth-quarter earnings and declared a dividend of 48 cents per share for the first quarter, payable on March 31. ARCC stock offers a dividend yield of 9.64%. Following the print, RBC Capital analyst Kenneth Lee reiterated a buy rating on Ares Capital and slightly lowered the price target to $22 from $23 as he adjusted his estimates. \"We favor ARCC's strong track record of managing risks through the cycle, and scale advantages,\" said Lee. The 5-star analyst highlighted that ARCC's credit performance remains strong despite recent concerns about software lending due to potential artificial intelligence-related disruption. Lee contends that investors are not fully valuing the resiliency of Ares Capital's software-lending business. The company is focused on lending to companies in foundational/infrastructure software, proprietary data, and regulated end markets.  Lee finds ARCC's credit performance encouraging, with non-accruals unchanged quarter-over-quarter at 1.8% of the portfolio. Furthermore, the company's internal risk grade remained unchanged at 3.1 compared with the prior quarter, and investments in the bottom 2 risk grades remained low at about 4% of the portfolio. Lee noted that management sees minimal AI risk over the near term and manageable risk over the medium and long term. Overall, Lee is bullish on Ares Capital, given that it is a market-leading BDC with its scale being a competitive advantage. He added that ARCC's dividends are well supported by the company's core earnings per share and potential net realized gains.Lee ranks No. 689 among more than 12,100 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been successful 62% of the time, delivering an average return of 8.7%. See Ares Capital Financials on TipRanks. ConocoPhillipsOil and gas exploration and production company ConocoPhillips (COP) recently reported its fourth-quarter results and announced a dividend of 84 cents per share for the first quarter. The company distributed $9 billion, or 45% of its cash flow operations, to shareholders, including $5 billion through share repurchases and $4 billion in dividends. COP offers a dividend yield of 2.91%. In reaction to fourth-quarter results, Goldman Sachs analyst Neil Mehta reaffirmed a buy rating on COP stock and raised the price target to $120 from $115. Despite concerns about weaker-than-expected U.S. natural gas realizations and outlook for Lower 48 volumes amid the current commodity prices backdrop, Mehta remains bullish on ConocoPhillips due to its high-quality, low-cost inventory, solid free cash flow, and attractive capital returns. Mehta highlighted that COP's management continues to target $7 billion of incremental free cash flow by 2029 compared with 2025, at a WTI price of $70/barrel. About $1 billion of this target is expected in 2026, backed by the North Field East project.\"We see long-term value in shares as major projects come online, capital rolls off, and oil supply/demand fundamentals improve,\" said Mehta. The analyst is positive about ConocoPhillips achieving its 2029 free cash flow target, supported by its four major growth projects (NFE, North Field South, Port Arthur, and Willow) and $1 billion in cost reductions and margin enhancements. Mehta expects COP to return about 45% of cash from operations, in line with the company's long-term track record. Mehta ranks No. 559 among more than 12,100 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been successful 62% of the time, delivering an average return of 10.7%. See ConocoPhillips Ownership Structure on TipRanks. Devon EnergyAnother dividend-paying stock in this week's list is Devon Energy (DVN), a leading oil and gas producer with a diversified multi-basin portfolio. Earlier this month, Devon announced an all-stock merger with Coterra Energy (CTRA) to become a large-cap producer with a dominant position in the Permian Basin.Interestingly, upon closing of the deal, Devon plans to offer a quarterly dividend of 31.5 cents per share (up from DVN's current fixed dividend of 24 cents per share) and a new share repurchase authorization exceeding $5 billion, both subject to board approval. Currently, at an annualized dividend of 96 cents per share, DVN offers a dividend yield of 2.14%. In response to the deal news, Siebert Williams Shank analyst Gabriele Sorbara reiterated a buy rating on Devon Energy stock and raised his price target to $55 from $50. Based on early assumptions, Sorbara expects the Coterra acquisition to be accretive to discounted cash flow per share, enterprise value to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EV/EBITDA), and free cash flow yield, with net debt to EBITDA leverage reducing slightly. Sorbara expects the Devon-Coterra combination to be viewed positively, as it boosts DVN's size and scale, helping it to compete with the likes of EOG Resources, Diamondback Energy, and Occidental Petroleum. The 5-star analyst expects Devon's improved competitive position to \"ultimately drive a re-rating as the Company executes on the financial and operational front.\"Regarding Devon's upcoming fourth-quarter 2025 results, Sorbara expects the company to report another quarter of strong operational and financial execution. He expects investors to focus on early commentary on the Coterra deal, especially insights into assets under strategic review and the company's target of achieving $1.0 billion in annual pretax deal synergies by the end of 2027. Sorbara ranks No. 313 among more than 12,100 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been successful 63% of the time, delivering an average return of 15.1%. See Devon Energy Stock Buybacks on TipRanks.",

    "body": "Cuba's President Miguel Diaz-Canel (C) takes part in the \"Anti-Imperialist\" protest in front of the US Embassy against the US incursion in Venezuela, where 32 Cuban soldiers lost their lives, in Havana on January 16, 2026.Yamil Lage | Afp | Getty ImagesCuba's communist-run government is facing its biggest test since the collapse of the Soviet Union.U.S. President Donald Trump has ratcheted up the pressure on the Caribbean island since the Jan. 3, military operation to seize Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, a long-time ally of Cuba's government. Cuba said 32 of its citizens were killed in the attack.Trump has since effectively cut Cuba off from Venezuelan oil, called its government \"an unusual and extraordinary threat\" and pledged to impose tariffs on any country that supplies it with oil.Cuban President Miguel Díaz-Canel condemned the move and said: \"Surrender is not an option.\" He's since said the government is prepared to hold talks with Washington, albeit \"without pressure or preconditions.\"The country has warned that international airlines would no longer be able refuel in the country due to fuel shortages. Gripped by a worsening economic crisis, Cuba's government recently adopted rationing measures to protect essential services and ration fuel supplies for key sectors.The plan reportedly includes restrictions on fuel sales, the closure of some tourist establishments, shortening school days and a shorter working week at state-owned companies to four days, from Monday to Thursday. \"The current situation in Cuba is as serious as it has been since the 1990s, when Cuba suddenly had to survive without the support of the Eastern Bloc,\" Par Kumaraswami, professor of Latin American Studies at the U.K.'s University of Nottingham, told CNBC by email.The odds are shortening that President Miguel Díaz-Canel will be forced from power in the weeks or months ahead in a Maduro-style managed transition.Robert MunksHead of Americas research at Verisk MaplecroftTrump's tariff threats have created a deterrent for many nations, Kumaraswami said.Mexico has sent humanitarian aid but suspended oil shipments, as it sought to preserve its relationship with Havana while avoiding Trump's tariffs.Kumaraswami said there was \"of course frustration with the difficulties of daily life,\" but that \"many Cubans are resolved to resist threats to their national sovereignty and a new wave of patriotism has emerged.\"'An accelerating collapse' Air Canada subsequently has canceled all flights to Cuba amid the fuel shortage, though the airline said Monday that it would bring some 3,000 customers already in the country home over the coming days. Tourism is a significant source of revenue for Cuba's cash-strapped government and the country is a popular winter vacation destination for Canadian tourists.  A Turkish Airlines plane takes off at Jose Marti International Airport in Havana on February 9, 2026.Yamil Lage | Afp | Getty ImagesUnlike in previous crises, Cuba's regime lacks foreign partners that can step in to help, according to Robert Munks, head of Americas research at risk intelligence company Verisk Maplecroft. \"Raising the stakes, the US has also limited Cuba's access to hard currency and pressured Nicaragua to end visa-free travel for Cubans,\" Munks told CNBC by email.The government's pledge to increase the use of limited renewable energy sources is likely \"too little, too late,\" Munks said. He added that outbreaks of civil unrest were possible, given that the island's domestic energy production is far short of what it needs to keep the lights on. \"An accelerating collapse of basic services will put the regime under extreme pressure to find a negotiated solution,\" Munks said.He added that \"the odds are shortening\" on Díaz-Canel being forced from power in the months ahead in a Maduro-style managed transition, but Munks said it was more likely that \"the regime will try to muddle through\" until the U.S. midterm elections in November.Read moreCuba's dwindling oil supplies prompted the United Nations to warn of a possible humanitarian \"collapse\" last week.\"The Secretary-General is extremely concerned about the humanitarian situation in Cuba, which will worsen, and if not collapse, if its oil needs go unmet,\" said UN spokesperson Stéphane Dujarric.A big test for BRICS Cuba's emergency measures should be seen as crucial test for the BRICS bloc of developing nations, according to Helen Yaffe, a Cuba expert and professor of Latin American political economy at the University of Glasgow, Scotland.\"This is probably the most important test now for BRICS … If BRICS cannot protect, defend and rally around a member, then what is it worth?\" Yaffe told CNBC by telephone.  Cuba acquired \"partner country\" status of the BRICS group in January last year, bolstering its ties with the likes of Brazil, Russia and China. Indeed, each of these three countries have sought to offer support to Cuba in recent days.The Mexican government has dispatched humanitarian aid to the people of Cuba aboard two ships of the Mexican Navy. More than 800 tons of supplies were transported by sea from Asipona, in Veracruz, Mexico, on February 9, 2026.Anadolu | Anadolu | Getty ImagesA spokesperson for China's foreign ministry said Tuesday that Beijing \"stands firmly against the inhumane actions that deprive the Cuban people of their right to subsistence and development.\" They added that China would, \"as always,\" seek to provide assistance to Cuba.Russia, meanwhile, has described Havana's fuel situation as \"truly critical\" and said U.S. attempts to further pressure the country were causing numerous problems.\"The Cuban government is not going to submit,\" Yaffe said. \"The fact is, [the U.S. is] going to keep squeezing and the Cubans are going to keep resisting and there's going to be a lot of unnecessary suffering.\" She added: \"I'm a historian and it's very vainglorious for historians to try and predict the future but we can look at trends — and I can guarantee you that we were here before in the early 1990s where nobody thought Cuba would pull together and pull through — and they did.\"",

    "body": "Pedestrians stand in front of an electronic quotation board displaying the numbers of the Nikkei Stock Average on the Tokyo Stock Exchange in Tokyo on Feb. 3, 2026.Kazuhiro Nogi | Afp | Getty ImagesJapan's economy grew 0.1% in the fourth quarter of 2025 compared with the previous three months, narrowly avoiding a technical recession.While it was a reversal of the 0.7% contraction in the third quarter, the gross domestic product missed expectations of a 0.4% expansion by economists polled by Reuters.A technical recession is commonly defined as two consecutive quarters of contraction. On an annualized basis, output rose 0.2%, compared with forecasts of 1.6%, following a 2.3% decline in the previous quarter.Compared with a year earlier, fourth-quarter GDP expanded 0.1%, slowing from 0.6% in the third quarter. Private consumption drove the modest expansion, offsetting weakness in exports and public spending, according to data from Japan's Cabinet Office.Following the data release, the Nikkei 225 opened up 0.12%, but the yen weakened 0.25% to 153.06 against the dollar.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconThe Bank of Japan in January raised its economic growth forecast for the fiscal year ending March 2026 to 0.9% from 0.7%. It also lifted its fiscal 2026 outlook to 1% from 0.7%.The central bank said it expects moderate expansion as other countries return to growth. The BOJ also said it sees a virtuous cycle of rising prices and wages, supported by the government's economic measures and accommodative financial conditions.The data also comes as Japan works with the U.S., its second-largest trading partner, on a $550 billion investment pledge under its trade deal with Washington.Public broadcaster NHK reported last Friday that Tokyo and Washington have yet to agree on the first projects tied to the pledge. Japan Economy Minister Ryosei Akazawa was quoted as saying he hoped the initial projects would be finalized before Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi meets U.S. President Donald Trump.Trump had announced the meeting with Takaichi just before the Feb. 8 Lower House election, which saw Takaichi lead the ruling Liberal Democratic Party to a landslide victory.After her victory, Takaichi said last Monday that she would support economic growth by boosting investment through \"proactive\" fiscal policy, although she did not elaborate. She had earlier pledged to suspend food taxes for two years and boost defence spending to 2% of the country's GDP.Defense will be the next major catalyst driving Japanese equities higher, said Bruce Kirk, Chief Japan Equity Strategist and managing director at Goldman Sachs. Speaking to CNBC's \"Squawk Box Asia,\" Kirk pointed to Takaichi's upcoming meeting with Trump, saying he expects a \"flurry of announcements\" involving Japanese and U.S. companies across areas such as industrialization, factory automation, and shipbuilding. Kirk also highlighted a document released by the Trump administration over the weekend that called for the restoration of U.S. maritime dominance and touted cooperation with Japan and South Korea in revitalizing shipbuilding.Before the election, Takaichi had announced a record 122 trillion yen budget for the fiscal year starting April 1, marking a second straight year of record spending and vowing to support households with cost-of-living pressures. Japan's inflation had slowed sharply to 2.1% in January, its lowest level since March 2022. Still, prices have remained above the Bank of Japan's 2% target for 45 consecutive months.— CNBC's Martin Soong contributed to this report.",

    "body": "The Warner Bros. logo is displayed on a water tower at Warner Bros. Studio on September 12, 2025 in Burbank, California. Mario Tama | Getty ImagesWarner Bros. Discovery's board is considering reopening sales talks with Paramount Skydance after recently receiving an amended offer with sweetened deal terms, Bloomberg News reported on Sunday, citing unnamed sources.Warner Bros. in December agreed to sell both its film studio and HBO Max streaming service to Netflix for $27.75 per share. Paramount, which owns CBS and MTV, in December launched a hostile bid for Warner Bros., promising its shareholders $30 per share in an all-cash deal. Last week, Paramount upped the ante, saying it would add a ticking fee of 25 cents a share to its offer for any delay in regulatory approval of the deal. The ticking fee would be approximately $650 million in cash value per quarter for every quarter the deal has not closed by Dec. 31, 2026, CNBC.com previously reported.Paramount also said it will cover a $2.8 billion termination fee paid to Netflix if the Warner Bros. deal is terminated. Paramount also said it will eliminate $1.5 billion in possible debt refinancing costs. Both Paramount and Netflix have said they would be willing to raise their bids to secure the Warner Bros. deal, Bloomberg reported. However, this is the first time Warner Bros. has considered whether Paramount's offer could either result in a better deal or prompt Netflix to offer better deal terms, according to the report.Read the complete Bloomberg report here.WATCH: Chadwick: This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for Paramountwatch now",

    "body": "The TikTok Inc. sign in front of the building on Tuesday, Jan. 27, 2026 in Culver City, CA.Kayla Bartkowski | Los Angeles Times | Getty ImagesTikTok's U.S. joint venture seems to have survived a turbulent rollout with minimal change in usership, as early narratives of a mass user exodus prompted by service outages and censorship concerns now appear overstated, according to new figures.Survey data from market intelligence firm Sensor Tower show that, despite a surge in deletions following the announcement of TikTok's U.S. joint venture on Jan. 23, the average number of TikTok's daily active users in the U.S. remains around 95% of its usership compared to the week of Jan. 19-25.The joint venture — officially the TikTok USDS Joint Venture  — was established in compliance with U.S. President Donald Trump's executive order mandating the divestiture of TikTok in the U.S. from its Chinese parent company ByteDance.While ByteDance retains a 19.9% stake in TikTok's U.S. operations after the agreement, Oracle, Silver Lake, and Abu Dhabi-based investment firm MGX each own a 15% share, with the remaining shares divvied among several other firms.Following the announcement, users were quick to express discontent over TikTok's new ownership.The deal drew scrutiny, with prominent figures like Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) raising concerns about cronyism over Oracle co-founder and Chief Technical Officer Larry Ellison's involvement.Following the joint venture's announcement that Ellison's Oracle would \"retrain, test, and update the content recommendation algorithm on U.S. user data\", online speculation mounted that TikTok would begin mining user data or promoting content supportive of Trump's policy positions.Such concerns spiked on Jan. 25, with users claiming that TikTok was suppressing content critical of controversial Immigration and Customs Enforcement operations, and censoring buzzwords like 'Epstein' on the platform.Last month, CNBC confirmed that messages containing the word \"Epstein\" triggered an error message, but was unable to independently verify broader claims of political censorship.Asked about the issues, a spokesperson for the TikTok joint venture told CNBC in January that the platform does not prohibit sharing the name 'Epstein' in messages and that it was investigating why some users are experiencing the problem, among others.CNBC reached out to the White House and TikTok for comment but did not receive a response by publication.Engagement metrics unchangedAlthough TikTok attributed last month's disruptions to power outages, the glitches \"no doubt impact[ed] how and what content was being served, even without any intent or motive,\" according to Jim Johnston, partner at law firm Davis+Gilbert LLP.Yet despite various user pledges to boycott the platform over apparent political suppression, engagement metrics among U.S. users suggest there has been little sign of a mass exodus.The average daily time spent by American users on the platform has since returned to around 80 minutes, after dipping to an average of 77 minutes during the week of the reported disruptions, according to Sensor Tower data.Additionally, while deletions spiked after the reported disruptions, they tapered off the following week, suggesting a temporary surge rather than a sustained boycott of the app.\"It is plausible that the short-lived rise in observed uninstalls was due to an attempt to troubleshoot the app,\" Abraham Yousef, senior insights analyst at Sensor Tower, told CNBC, as the number of uninstalls followed by re-installations on the same day surged more than 70% on Jan. 25 from the day before.While Yousef grants that the data suggests a \"slight impact to overall usage\" in the weeks after the Joint Venture was announced, there is no clear indication of a structural shift in user trends, as many sites touted as alternatives to TikTok have also struggled to sustain interest.According to Sensor Tower, the number of new installs for UpScrolled - a social media platform that offers an algorithm free of automated systems that filter out content from some users known as shadow banning - surged by about 770% from the previous week, with more than 955,000 new U.S. downloads over the week of Jan. 26 to Feb. 1.New UpScrolled downloads, however, fell sharply by about 80% the following week, bringing in only around 191,000 new users. In comparison, TikTok registered 870,000 downloads over the week of Jan. 26 to Feb. 1, and around 800,000 the following week.Similarly, new downloads of other alternative platforms such as Skylight Social and Red Note respectively declined by 96% and 33% week-on-week from the week of Jan. 26.Tenuous evidence of mass exodusSensor Tower's user data more fundamentally seems to suggest that beyond anecdotal claims, users have largely been unable to identify tangible changes in TikTok's American operations, or at least, not enough to meaningfully shift user sentiment.\"The idea of a mass exodus from TikTok now looks overblown,\" Kelsey Chickering, principal analyst from Forrester, told CNBC. \"Anecdotally, most users say the app feels largely the same - the algorithm hasn't meaningfully changed, and the experience is still strong,\" While some American users may have perceived changes in the operation of their TikTok algorithms, \"some changes to content suggestions are bound to occur simply due to the changed data set,\" according to Johnston, referring to the Joint Venture's announcement to retrain the algorithm on U.S. data.But while analysts have been unable to find evidence that TikTok's new American owners have engineered the platform in their favor, this is not a foregone conclusion.According to Johnston, there are at least three notable changes to TikTok's new terms of use, including the platform's ability to collect precise location data from enabled devices, its collection of data on interactions with artificial intelligence tools on the app and its explicit integration with ad networks.Although there has been no hard evidence of its occurrence, it remains technically possible to adjust TikTok's algorithm to enhance or diminish the impact of certain types of content on recommendations, Johnston said.Chickering adds that under its new owners, TikTok has more control over what shows up on American feeds, but this control, according to Chickering, is where TikTok's opportunity - and risk - lies. \"If moderation starts to feel politically slanted or misinformation isn't adequately addressed, the platform could face backlash from users and advertisers alike,\" Chickering said, \"We've seen this play out before: Twitter's shift to X is a recent reminder of how quickly trust can erode.\"For now, however, the discontent from TikTok's American users that marred its first few weeks under new ownership seems to have largely subsided.As Chickering notes, \"we've seen time and time again, if the product works, users tend to stick around regardless of who owns it.\"— CNBC's Dylan Butts contributed to this report.",

    "body": "President Donald Trump speaks to the media as he walks to board Marine One prior to departure from the South Lawn of the White House in Washington, Feb. 13, 2026.Andrew Caballero-Reynolds | AFP | Getty ImagesPresident Donald Trump's iron grip on the Republican Party might be starting to loosen, just a bit. The few elected Republicans who regularly cross him — including Kentucky Rep. Thomas Massie and Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina — are more vocal than ever. And in recent days, daylight has emerged between the president and a handful of his top supporters in Congress.The apparent shift is underway as Trump, the Republican Party's undisputed leader, grapples with stubbornly low approval ratings — especially on the economy, a perennial issue on which he was elected that has only grown more important to Americans chafing under high prices.Six U.S. House Republicans voted this week to overturn Trump's tariffs on Canada. Tillis remained resolute in holding up the president's Fed chair nomination in protest over a Justice Department investigation of the current one. The administration pulled back the sustained anti-immigration law enforcement push in Minnesota. And fallout from the Epstein files — in which Trump and allies are mentioned — is roiling the world and its most powerful players.Democrats are jumping on the opening, with some pushing a narrative that \"the tide is turning\" on Trump. Their perceived momentum follows big wins in last fall's off-year elections after hammering an affordability message, and as prediction markets favor them to win control of the House in the midterms.\"Trump's grip on power is slipping,\" Rep. Jim McGovern, D-Mass., said Thursday in a gloating social media post. \"Nobody is taking his bulls--- that somehow he's lowering prices for families.\"The administration's efforts this week to wrest the affordability narrative — by drawing attention to Trump's drug-pricing initiatives, or to gains in the stock market, or to projections that Americans' tax refunds will rise this season — have been muddied by the deluge of political setbacks and controversies. Trump on Friday gave a passing glance to curbing price increases when he spoke to troops in North Carolina hours after the release of January consumer price index figures that showed slowing inflation.He's had fewer public appearances since a racist social media post last Friday, a shift from his recent cadence of Oval Office appearances in front of reporters with supporters from the political ranks and business community. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is a frequent press conference partner of Trump, but his visit to the White House this week yielded no public remarks.White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt, when asked about challenges to Trump from the Republican Party, said the party will stay together with the president as its leader. \"Under President Trump's leadership, Republicans will remain united together against the radical Democrats, who will destroy our country once again, if given the chance, with wide open borders, noncitizens voting in elections, and horrible economic policy,\" Leavitt said via email.Read more CNBC politics coverageEpstein files: DOJ says it logs Congress members' searches to 'protect' victim informationEpstein files: AG Pam Bondi seemed to have Rep. Jayapal's DOJ database search history at hearingJudge blocks Pete Hegseth's censure of Sen. Mark Kelly over troops video, for nowWatch Pam Bondi hearing: AG touts record Dow as Democrats grill her over Trump, EpsteinThe majority-GOP House of Representatives' vote to override Trump's tariffs on Canadian goods only came about because three Republican members previously sided with Democrats to defeat a rule that would have blocked House votes on Trump's tariffs through July. Trump's threats of retaliation didn't thwart the end result.While the tariff votes are almost purely symbolic, they show GOP leadership failing to stop enough of their members from publicly defying Trump on his signature economic policy. Republicans can only afford to lose one vote in the House to prevail on party-line votes.A day after the House tariff vote, U.S. border czar Tom Homan announced the government would wrap up its immigration enforcement \"surge\" in Minnesota, following public outcry against federal agents' aggressive tactics exacerbated by the killing of two U.S. citizens in Minneapolis.A new AP-NORC poll found most Americans think the administration's deployment of deportation forces has gone too far, and that the GOP's advantage on immigration has shrunk since last year.The Minnesota actions drew fiery pushback not only from protesters and Democrats but also from business owners. In an open letter shared Thursday, more than 266 businesses from across the U.S. that said they represent 100,000 others warned the government's actions threaten free markets. A series of other Trump-related stumbles have drawn national focus away from the administration's attempt to tout its accomplishments.Last week, the president's social media account posted a racist image depicting the Obamas as apes. Numerous Republicans spoke out forcefully and quickly against the post, including close Trump ally Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina, the only Black Senate Republican, who called it \"the most racist thing I've seen out of this White House.\"The White House initially defended the post, but after the flood of bipartisan outrage, pivoted to blaming it on an unnamed staffer. Trump subsequently condemned the image but refused to apologize.This week, a federal grand jury rejected U.S. prosecutors' attempt to indict six Democratic lawmakers, weeks after Trump accused them of sedition for telling military members not to follow unlawful orders. It is highly unusual for grand juries to decline to indict.The Department of Justice is also in the midst of a criminal investigation into Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, whose refusal to quickly slash interest rates has made him a top target of Trump's ire.The probe, which Powell says is retaliatory, has prompted vocal pushback from Republicans worried about the erosion of the central bank's long-established independence.Tillis, who is retiring at the end of his current term, is blocking all Trump administration nominees to the Fed — including Kevin Warsh, the president's pick to replace Powell — from advancing through the Senate until the DOJ drops the investigation.The president has said U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia Jeanine Pirro, a Trump loyalist, should continue the probe to completion. Scott, the Senate Banking Committee chairman, said he does not believe Powell committed a crime —while Trump has repeatedly claimed Powell is either corrupt or grossly incompetent, complaining about cost overruns on building renovations. Numerous Republicans on the Banking panel agree that Powell did not commit a crime, according to Tillis.Trump is also grappling with the fallout from the DOJ's release of millions of its files on notorious sexual predator Jeffrey Epstein, which is only intensifying days after the latest disclosures. Trump had opposed a bill forcing the DOJ to publicly share its files, but he reversed course as a growing number of Republicans geared up to vote for it anyway. The newly released records have revealed ties between Epstein and administration officials, including Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, who has since admitted visiting Epstein's island for lunch with his family in 2012.",

Photo: Sven Hoppe/dpa (Photo by Sven Hoppe/picture alliance via Getty Images)Picture Alliance | Picture Alliance | Getty ImagesMany European policymakers appear to still be smarting from U.S. Vice President JD Vance's tough words about the region at last year's Munich Security Conference.So, it's perhaps not too surprising that U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio's comments on Saturday at this year's event underscoring the U.S. and Europe's common heritage, goals and challenges have come as something of a relief in European capitals.\"[Rubio] delivered a speech which still assured us that we stand together in this partnership between Europe and the United States,\" German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul told CNBC in an interview on the sidelines of the conference. \"Of course, there are some questions which we will have to discuss, but in the end of the day, his message was clear that we were so successful in the past, and we should do the job once again with new threats, with new tests in the 21st century.\"On Saturday, Rubio said the U.S. has no intention of abandoning its deep alliance with Europe and wants the region to succeed.\"We want Europe to be strong,\" he told the gathering of defense and security officials in the German city. \"We believe that Europe must survive, because the two great wars of the last century serve, for us, as history's great reminder, that ultimately, our destiny is, and will always be, intertwined with yours.\"Contrast that to Vance's message to the same crowd last year, when he spoke of the \"retreat of Europe from some of its most fundamental values, values shared with the United States of America.\" He lambasted his audience about the health of their democracies, their migration policies and freedom of speech.While Rubio's tone might have been more conciliatory than Vance's, the underlying issues remained the same, as some conference attendees acknowledged.watch now\"Of course, there were some issues he raised. We would answer differently when it comes to the migration problem, when it comes, of course, to question how we organize our legal framework here in Europe with regard to the digital services. And of course, also with the question of freedom of speech and so,\" Wadephul said.U.S. President Donald Trump has frequently criticized Europe for its open migration policies, for being too reliant on the U.S. for its security and has pushed NATO allies to boost defense spending. His pursuit of ownership of Greenland, a Danish territory, has also rattled European leaders in recent months.\"The message we heard (from Rubio) is that America and Europe are intertwined, they have been in the past and will be in the future,\" the EU's chief diplomat, Kaja Kallas, said at a panel discussion on Sunday. \"I think this is important. It is also clear that we don't see eye-to-eye in all the issues and that this will remain the case. But I think we can work from there.\"'Europe bashing'A recurring theme at this year's event has been an earnest investigation into how Europe can stand on its own two feet, militarily and economically, in the face of challenges from Russia and China while the U.S. seeks to rework the global post-war order it created.While European leaders acknowledge they must become less dependent on the U.S.'s security umbrella and markets, some bristle at the Trump administration's more confrontational approach compared to its predecessors.\"I think there were messages for us, and there were messages for the public in America, especially their constituents,\" Kallas said. \"For me, every time I hear this European bashing, it's very in fashion right now, I'm thinking of what is the alternative?\"Kaja Kallas, vice president of the European Commission, at the Munich Security Conference in Munich, Germany, on Sunday, Feb. 15, 2026. Nuclear deterrence is set to be a hot topic at the conference. Photographer: Alex Kraus/Bloomberg via Getty ImagesBloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesOthers were even more critical of Rubio's comments.\"To be frank, I think the fact that we have, for Europeans, [been] asked to comment on the speech by the Americans, is already part of the problem,\" Benjamin Haddad, France's Minister Delegate for Europe, said at the same panel.\"We should not either be relieved or shocked by this or that speech. And I think the worst lesson we could draw from this weekend is to say 'I can cling to some love words I heard in part of his speech and push the snooze button.'\" He said Europe should \"just focus on ourselves, focus on what we can control. Focus on our rearmaments, on the support for Ukraine, and the threat that Russia poses to all of our democracies. Focus on competitiveness.\"Wadephul told CNBC that work to become more independent is underway.\"But this is what we are doing on our own, and Europe has also learned that, of course, if you ask for more European sovereignty, you will receive it,\" he said.\"And that also means that, of course, we are more independent than we were in the past. And of course, we are looking for new global partners in the world which are willing to work together with Europe, for instance, Japan, India, Brazil and so on. So this is, I would say, if you are looking to a new global order, this means we keep our alliances, but additionally, we have new global partners, and this is a good future for Europe.\"",

    "body": "watch nowPresident Donald Trump on Friday said he will  issue an executive order \"shortly\" laying out the \"legal reasons\" for national voter-identification requirements.Trump, in posts late Friday to Truth Social, said he wants voter-ID laws implemented for the 2026 midterm elections, even though legislation mandating them appears poised to stall in Congress.\"The Democrats refuse to vote for Voter I.D., or Citizenship. The reason is very simple — They want to continue to cheat in Elections,\" Trump posted to Truth Social.  \"This was not what our Founders desired. I have searched the depths of Legal Arguments not yet articulated or vetted on this subject, and will be presenting an irrefutable one in the very near future. There will be Voter I.D. for the Midterm Elections, whether approved by Congress or not!\" he continued.In a second post, published minutes after the first, Trump said, \"If we can't get it through Congress, there are Legal reasons why this SCAM is not permitted. I will be presenting them shortly, in the form of an Executive Order.\"Under pressure from Trump, his allies in the House and Senate and conservative online influencers, the issue of voter ID has dominated social media and reverberated through the halls of Congress in recent days. Trump's comments have also raised fears among Democrats and voting-rights groups that the president could try to intervene in this year's pivotal midterm elections, as Republicans try to hold on to slim majorities in both chambers.President Donald Trump speaks to members of the media on the South Lawn of the White House before boarding Marine One in Washington, Feb. 13, 2026.Samuel Corum | Sipa | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesThe House on Wednesday advanced, 218-213, a Trump-backed elections bill, dubbed the SAVE America Act, that would require proof of citizenship to register to vote and photo ID to cast a ballot. All but one Democrat voted against the proposal, which critics argue could disenfranchise millions and make it harder for people including women whose birth certificates would not show a married name to register. It now moves to the Senate, where it needs 60 votes to overcome a filibuster. Republicans hold just 53 seats in the chamber — and one, Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, has come out against the proposal. More than a handful of Democrats would have to support the legislation for it to succeed. Only one Senate Democrat, John Fetterman of Pennsylvania, has supported national voter-ID requirements, though he told the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette this week that he doesn't support other voting restrictions such as limiting mail-in ballots.Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., has vowed that Democrats will block the bill, calling it \"dead on arrival.\"\"The SAVE Act is not a mainstream bill whatsoever. It's a fringe piece of legislation that has now taken over the Republican Party, masquerading as election security when it's really about laying the groundwork to meddle in the midterm elections and make it much harder for people to vote,\" Schumer said from the Senate floor this week.Trump has recently said he wants to nationalize federal elections and revived election conspiracies, launching an FBI investigation into the election results in Fulton County, Georgia, a state the president has repeatedly and without evidence said he won in 2020. States are granted control of most aspects of U.S. elections under the Constitution.In his second post on Friday, Trump cast the midterms in existential terms. \"(T)hese Corrupt and Deranged Democrats, if they ever gain power, will not only be adding two States to our roster of 50, with all of the baggage thereto, but will also PACK THE COURT with a total of 21 Supreme Court Justices, THEIR DREAM, which they will submit easily and rapidly when they immediately move to terminate the Filibuster, probably in their first week, or sooner,\" Trump wrote. \"Our Country will never be the same if they allow these demented and evil people to knowingly, and happily, destroy it. Thank you for your attention to this matter — SAVE AMERICA!,\" he continued.",

    "body": "watch nowLast spring, Chantel Williams' position in the federal government was in limbo. Williams, once a General Services Administration employee on its hiring and recruitment team, found herself in a state of confusion and anxiety. The agency she worked for was in a holding pattern as Elon Musk's so-called Department of Government Efficiency began its work to aggressively shrink the size and scope of government agencies at President Donald Trump's direction.The DOGE cuts, a pillar of Trump's second term, were swift and wide-reaching across the federal workforce. Some of the most affected agencies included the U.S. Agency for International Development, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the Department of Health and Human Services, and the Department of Education. \"As a federal employee, the oath is to the work and to the role, and not the administration,\" Williams said. \"It started off as feeling very startling that the transition wasn't occurring as seamlessly as it had in prior years, because I had been working at GSA through a transition before.\" Williams said she felt, for the first time, real turmoil about working for the federal government. \"It was hard to wake up every day wanting to continue to serve but feel as though your leadership may have a different priority or maybe an opposition of you continuing to move forward in that mission,\" said Williams.In the end, she opted to take deferred resignation, receiving pay to leave her government post. She joined thousands of others in what was the largest reduction of the federal workforce in history, according to the U.S. Office of Personnel Management. At the end of 2025, OPM reported that approximately 352,000 employees exited roles last year, with more than 123,000 taking the deferred resignation offer. In a release late last year, OPM said it was \"in line with President Trump's goal of a smaller, more efficient government.\"Caitlin Lewis, founder and director of Work for America, started her career in local government in New York City. Lewis launched the nonprofit in November of 2024 and has helped placed former federal workers in new roles around the country in the wake of federal workforce reductions over the last year.Megan Leigh Barnard | Work for AmericaAs mass layoffs and resignations hit federal workers like Williams, Caitlin Lewis stepped in to help.Her nonprofit, Work for America, launched in November 2024 to help local governments recruit talent to fill gaps in staffing. Through its Civic Match platform, it helps former federal workers find new roles at the state and local level. The Work for America team has grown from two people to 15 in the last year, and the vast majority have come from prior careers in state, local and federal government. Four employees came directly from federal government roles.\"We never imagined the volume of need that was going to occur,\" Lewis said. \"What is so unique about this job seeker population is how unexpected the layoffs were for so many of them. Government has long been a place of stability and meaning making, and so much of what we understand the government job to be was really upended in that moment.\"Lewis, the daughter of a forest firefighter and a youth prison counselor who grew up in California, said she became civically engaged at a young age. That engagement led her to local government in New York City in the Bill de Blasio administration, first in the mayor's office and then in housing and economic development. Work for America was informed by that experience. \"In a place like New York, it really showed me how when you have the right people in the right roles in government, that the public sector really can move mountains, and when you don't, the basics start to fall apart,\" she said. \"And unfortunately we've seen that occurring in communities across the country where there hasn't been the ability to get the right talent to lean into critical roles.\"Williams quickly landed a job at Work for America after taking deferred resignation. She is now a product and data manager with the nonprofit.In the last year, Work for America has placed nearly 200 job seekers, 150 of which are former federal workers, in roles across the country. More than 12,800 job seekers have signed up for Civic Match since Trump's election, representing more than 30 federal agencies. \"For many, it's been a year of chaos and confusion. But we saw for our customers — cities and state governments across the country — that there was a true opportunity to capture the incredible talent that was going to be exiting Washington,\" Lewis said.Nate Haight turned to Civic Match as sweeping cuts took place at USAID, where he spent a decade of his career. Haight started out as an intern, then became a contractor, and by last year had been working as an education advisor and contract and grants specialist in its Latin America and Caribbean Bureau. Last February, he was told his job was under review and would most likely be cut.\"I particularly loved my work in the education sector. It was really meaningful being able to go out and see the impact that the programs were having around the world,\" Haight said. \"I was invested in the work and I saw the difference that it was making.\"He opted to take the deferred resignation offer from the government and found a new role through Work for America's platform, knowing competition would be steep locally given how many other former federal workers were looking for jobs. Today, he's in Indiana with his wife and four children, working as a grants administrator for the city of Indianapolis and Marion County.\"I think the satisfaction and fulfillment that I've been able to find already working in local government, I just want to encourage others to give it a shot as well ... and to encourage everyone to keep their head up and know that all of the skills and experiences that they've gained, they're going to be able to make a tremendous impact wherever they end up landing,\" Haight said of his fellow former federal workers.In the months to come, Civic Match is rolling out new features including candidate match scores powered by artificial intelligence, improved location targeting for jobs, city-specific pages and more. Hope Rahill, a former political appointee in the Biden administration who left her role as the Trump administration moved in, is now director of people and culture at Work for America. Rahill said while the group has had success in placing candidates, many former workers are still looking for work and coming up on a year of \"unemployment or underemployment.\"\"There are still so many people looking for work,\" Rahill said.",

    "body": "White House trade advisor Peter Navarro speaks to members of the media near the West Wing of the White House in Washington, D.C., U.S., August 21, 2025. Nathan Howard | ReutersPresident Donald Trump's trade and manufacturing adviser, Peter Navarro, said on Sunday that the White House may force data center builders to absorb their costs as voters continue to sour on the economy and utility prices soar. \"All of these data center builders, Meta on down, need to pay for all, all of the costs,\" Navarro said on Fox News' \"Sunday Morning Futures.\" \"They need to pay, not only pay for the electricity that they're using on the grid, but they have to pay for the resiliency that they're affecting as well. They need to pay for the water. So there's activity, action here going forward, where we force them to internalize the cost.\" Navarro did not detail what the White House's plan to force data center builders to internalize costs would look like. CNBC has reached out to the White House for clarification.When asked about Navarro's remarks, a Meta spokesperson said the company already pays for all of its energy usage. \"Meta pays the full costs for energy used by our data centers so they aren't passed onto consumers — and we go beyond that by paying for new and upgraded local infrastructure as well as adding new power to the grid,\" the spokesperson said.Read more CNBC politics coverageEpstein files: DOJ says it logs Congress members' searches to 'protect' victim informationEpstein files: AG Pam Bondi seemed to have Rep.

Mark Kelly over troops video, for nowWatch Pam Bondi hearing: AG touts record Dow as Democrats grill her over Trump, EpsteinData centers and their drag on utilities are part of the affordability problem. Electricity prices spiked 6.9% year over year in 2025 and show little sign of easing. Navarro sought to pin the blame for soaring costs on former President Joe Biden, who left office over a year ago. \"I just want to assure people that we're on it, we also feel your pain,\" Navarro said. \"We understand the ravages that inflation took on you because of Joe Biden's irresponsibility, but we are addressing that with economic policy that ultimately will make wages rise faster than the inflation rate, and that's the key to affordability.\" But Americans increasingly blame the Trump administration for rising costs. As the November 2026 midterms approach, polls consistently find Trump underwater on the economy. Democrats are pounding Trump and the Republicans on affordability, arguing that everyday goods and services have grown too expensive. Democrats have taken a 5.2 point lead in the generic ballot ahead of the November midterm elections that could loosen Trump's grip on Washington, according to polling averages from RealClearPolitics.While Navarro sought to blame the former president's administration for Americans' struggle with affordability, Trump himself has said he's \"very proud\" of the state of the economy. In an interview with \"NBC Nightly News\" that aired during the Super Bowl on Sunday, the president was asked, \"At what point are we in the Trump economy?\" \"I'd say we're there now,\" he replied.The Trump administration has recently taken steps to address the strain on data center electricity and rising utility costs. Several states and the White House signed a pact in January urging the nation's largest grid operator, PJM Interconnection, to make big technology companies pay for new power plants on the system. PJM operates the grid in some of the most data center-heavy areas in the U.S., including northern Virginia and New Jersey. Democratic Govs. Abigail Spanberger of Virginia and Mikie Sherrill of New Jersey both romped to victories in their states in 2025 after campaigning to lower electricity costs. The pact called for $15 billion in new generation capacity within PJM, to be financed by tech companies, and urged the operator to hold an emergency auction to procure the power. The move comes as the administration simultaneously fights offshore wind projects in the Northeast, some of which are fully permitted or under construction. \"Perhaps no region in America is more at risk than in PJM,\" Energy Secretary Chris Wright said after the announcement. \"That's why President Trump asked governors across the Mid-Atlantic to come together and call upon PJM to allow America to build big reliable power plants again.\"POLITICO last week reported on a draft compact that the White House wants tech companies to sign to ensure data centers don't affect consumers' utility bills.Trump said last month on Truth Social that he had struck a deal with Microsoft \"to ensure that Americans don't 'pick up the tab' for their POWER consumption, in the form of paying higher Utility bills.\" The president added that his administration was negotiating with other tech giants and that there would be \"More to come soon!\" Microsoft pledged last month not to raise utility costs near its data centers, and to replenish water used by the centers.WATCH: 'Alarm bells are ringing' on AI power demand, says EQT's Toby Ricewatch now",

    "body": "Habits shape how we work, how we manage stress, and how we relate to others. They determine whether we move closer to our goals, or repeat the same mistakes.The same is true in our romantic relationships. Our satisfaction, stability and sense of connection are directly related to the behaviors we default to every day. As a psychologist who studies couples — and as a husband — I've seen how some of the most powerful relationship rituals also happen to be the simplest. Here are five habits that reliably show up in the happiest, most resilient relationships.1. Actively celebrating each other's good newsHumans are biologically wired to focus on the negative. This bias helped our ancestors survive by scanning for threats. But in modern relationships, it often leads to pessimism, criticism or chronic dissatisfaction.Over time, a glass-half-empty mindset trains partners to look for problems rather than moments worth appreciating. That's why what researchers call \"capitalization,\" or how partners respond when the other shares good news, is so important.Studies show that when people respond with enthusiasm (i.e., asking questions, expressing interest, celebrating wins), couples report higher relationship satisfaction and stronger emotional bonds.2. Maintaining relationships outside the partnershipFeeling like your partner is \"your person\" matters a lot, but no one can realistically meet all of another person's emotional, social and psychological needs.Happy couples invest in friendships, family relationships and community connections, both together and independently. It prevents the relationship from becoming overburdened by unrealistic expectations.When partners feel socially supported beyond the relationship, they're less likely to feel resentful, trapped or emotionally depleted. The relationship becomes a place of choice, not obligation.3. Creating 'third spaces' togetherVariety is called the spice of life for a reason. Even strong relationships can begin to feel stale when the novelty disappears. This is especially true for couples who live together and work demanding jobs; the cycle of work, home, sleep and repeat can become monotonous over time.This is why happy couples actively seek out what researchers call “third spaces,\" or environments that exist outside of home (the first place) and work (the second place). It could be a favorite café, a climbing gym, a walking trail, a trivia night, or a class they take together.The primary purpose of the third space is intentional exploration. When you regularly introduce new third spaces into your routine, you inject a sense of novelty and adventure without needing to travel or make any major life changes.4. Practicing independence alongside togethernessConsistency and support are foundational in healthy relationships. But over time, some couples begin to over-rely on one another — for emotional regulation, decision-making or daily logistics. This can slowly lead to codependence.Happy couples counteract this by practicing independence. They maintain solo hobbies, spend time alone, or handle some responsibilities individually.This independence is vital for maintaining a sense of self. More importantly, it enables something many couples underestimate the value of: the chance to miss one another.5. Staying emotionally up to dateWaking up next to the same person every day can create the illusion of deep familiarity. Many couples assume that physical closeness naturally begets emotional closeness, but this is not the case. People grow and change in little ways more often than we realize.Happy couples always remain curious. They remind themselves that they’re both constantly evolving. By making time to ask questions, they also begin to notice all the new dreams, wants and needs in their partner. This protects them from one of the most common relationship pitfalls: distance despite proximity.Mark Travers, PhD, is a psychologist who specializes in relationships.

    "body": "When choosing a romantic partner, money is likely to play a factor in some capacity. From deciding who pays for the first date to figuring out how to split bills when you move in together, money comes up time and again throughout a relationship.Among single adults, 74% say financial stability is one of the most attractive traits in a partner, and 60% say financial compatibility matters more than chemistry in today's economy, according to a recent survey of over 2,100 Americans aged 18 and older from The Harris Poll. Financial compatibility is key in relationships because money doesn't just shape your lifestyle — how you approach and manage money is often reflective of other personality traits and attitudes, says Valerie Galinskaya, head of the Merrill Center for Family Wealth, a specialized group within wealth management company Merrill Lynch. The group provides education, insights and guidance to ultrahigh net worth families.\"It is oftentimes representative of other things like love, control, power. And if individuals don't take the time, especially couples, to really think through that, they are not really setting themselves up for success,\" Galinskaya says.Common red flags for daters include expecting the other person to pay for everything or having bad spending habits, The Harris Poll survey found. While these types of concerns may be dealbreakers for some, they could be things you can work through together if you decide you want to pursue the relationship anyway, Galinskaya says. However, she identifies other factors that could signal you and your partner are financially incompatible. Here are three to watch out for.1. Lack of willingness to share informationYou don't necessarily have to share your salary or how much debt you have on the first date, Galinskaya says. But as a relationship progresses, \"a lack of willingness to disclose information\" can be \"representative of really unhealthy patterns,\" she says.She emphasizes that there's a difference between \"privacy and secrecy,\" but adds that it can be challenging to set and accomplish goals like buying property or retiring together if one partner has been hiding things like unmanaged debt or a lack of savings. Relationship and money experts agree that transparent conversations around money are key to building successful relationships. \"Once you and your partner know how to talk about money, everything changes,\" self-made millionaire and money expert Ramit Sethi wrote in his book, \"Money for Couples.\" \"Strong couples know that handling money together is about values, trust, and communication,\" writes Heather Boneparth, director of business and legal affairs for Bone Fide Wealth and co-author of \"Money Together.\"2. Control issuesEspecially early on in a relationship, one partner trying to exert control over the other's financial decisions can be a sign of incompatibility, Galinskaya says. \"We all have different levels of the amount of control that we like to have,\" she says. \"But in my experience, [over-exerting control] can be a reflection of ... deeper trust and control issues, not often restricted to money.\"Additionally, rigid control of a partner's finances can be a sign of economic abuse, which is a form of domestic abuse, according to the National Network to End Domestic Violence. If you may be a victim of financial abuse, contact the National Domestic Violence Hotline at 800-799-SAFE or visit its website.Couples in long-term relationships should work toward making joint decisions when it comes to money, but it may start to be problematic if you want to make your own decision and \"your partner all of a sudden feels entitled to have a very strong input,\" Galinskaya says. 3. Ambition gapYou and your partner don't need to make the same or similar incomes to be compatible, Galinskaya says, but you should be more aligned on your views of productivity and ambition. If one partner is career-driven while the other is routinely in and out of jobs or isn't motivated to keep building their career, that \"can be a reflection that this is not going to be an individual who's really going to contribute,\" she says. \"Not just financially, but contribute their insight, their time, their effort in a relationship.\"One strategy Galinskaya suggests is for couples to start by defining what success means for them, whether that's building a business together or ensuring they have enough saved for retirement. It's unlikely you'll meet those goals if you don't first communicate them to each other and revisit them periodically as your lives and priorities change, she says.Want to improve your communication, confidence and success at work?

    "body": "Dating is full of tiny money moments: choosing a restaurant, talking about travel, splitting a check, and deciding whether a gift is \"too much.\" You don't need to ask someone how much they make, what their net worth is, or how much student loan debt they carry to learn how they approach money and what kind of financial partner they might be.Talking about money with a potential partner is never just about money. It's about values, habits, and expectations around how someone thinks a \"team\" should work. What not to ask early onOn your first few dates with someone, can you imagine actually asking, \"How much do you make?\" Or, \"What's your net worth?\" I wouldn't be surprised if they excused themselves to the restroom and didn't come back. The irony is, those questions aren't even the best way to get at what you're trying to learn. Someone can earn a lot and still feel financially unstable. Someone can earn less but have excellent systems, habits, and boundaries. The goal is to understand how they think about money and what their values are. 7 money questions to ask on a dateStart with these questions that invite real answers, stories, preferences, and patterns — and reveal their financial mindset more organically.\"Where did you grow up and what was it like?\" It's a basic getting-to-know-you question, but you'll learn a lot about the environment they were raised in, their family norms, and the lifestyle they consider \"normal,\" without forcing them into specifics.\"Tell me about your family. What were they like when you were a kid?\" People will tell you what shaped them if you give them an opening. Pay attention to themes like stability, ambition, generosity, privacy, education, status, faith, and community. These are the things that drive financial decisions.\"What was your first job?\" This is an easy way into someone's relationship with work, motivation, and independence. Did they feel proud, pressured, supported, or alone? Did they work well with other people? Those early experiences tend to show up in adulthood, including how someone thinks about earning and financial stability. A first job often reveals what money represents to them: freedom, security, responsibility, or survival. It can also hint at their default habits, like whether they saved their first paychecks, spent them immediately, or used them to help their family.\"Are you more of a planner or a wing-it person?\" This is a window into how someone handles uncertainty, and money is full of uncertainty. Two people can be completely different here and still work, but it helps to know what you might be signing up for early on — before life gets busy and important financial decisions have to be made.\"What's something you'll happily spend on and something you refuse to overpay for?\" Most people have \"yes\" categories and \"no\" categories that reflect their values. You can learn how they perceive things like convenience, health, quality, experiences, style, generosity, and savings. It's also a great way to talk about spending without getting into budgets.\"What's your ideal vacation?\" Vacation preferences are just as much about money expectations as they are about travel. A \"camping in national parks\" person and a \"boutique hotel and tasting menu\" person can find common ground, but it's helpful to learn early what someone assumes about cost and how they handle it when planning trips with other people. Do they openly talk about a budget before booking, or hope it all just works out?\"When you get stressed, what do you like to do?\" You're not fishing for a perfect answer. You're learning how someone copes with stress, because stress changes how people spend, save, and communicate about money. Some people plan. Some distract. Some shut down. Some spend. The key is whether they recognize their patterns, because self-awareness is what allows us to better manage our behaviors.When to get more directWhen money stops being theoretical and starts showing up in decisions that affect both of you — moving in, splitting regular expenses, building a shared life — it's time to have more direct and specific conversations.Money doesn't have to be a third wheel on your early dates with someone new. Start with questions that reveal how they think and live, and save the hard numbers for when you're building something together. That's how you avoid surprises and set the relationship up to last.Douglas A.

    "body": "Parents with children under age 18 can now begin registering for a new type of tax-advantaged savings account known as a Trump account when filing their 2025 tax returns. Register for the account, experts say, but don't wait for contributions to begin in July if you want to save for your children's futures.That's because Trump accounts aren't the only way to save for a child's future, especially for major expenses like college, says Alex Canellopoulos, a certified financial planner and director of investments at Vista Capital Partners.Take the \"free money,\" Canellopoulos says: For children born between 2025 and 2028, the Trump accounts will include a $1,000 federal deposit for parents who opt in, and children born before 2025 may be eligible for a $250 grant funded by a private $6.25 billion pledge from billionaires Michael and Susan Dell.But if you expect to pay for your child's education in the future, Canellopoulos says to also start saving now with a 529 college savings plan.\"The earlier you can save, the better,\" Canellopoulos says. \"We know how expensive college is already. If you believe your kid will go to college in the future, I wouldn't count on these expenses going down.\"529s versus Trump AccountsTrump accounts and 529 plans are both tax-advantaged vehicles designed for a child's future, but fundamentally, they serve different financial purposes with different time horizons, Canellopoulos says.A 529 plan is a state-sponsored savings tool that offers tax-free growth and withdrawals for qualified education costs. In contrast, a Trump account is essentially a retirement savings vehicle for newborns designed to build long-term wealth, Canellopoulos says.Though they will come with some penalty-free exceptions for qualified events, Trump Accounts will eventually convert into traditional individual retirement accounts and are subject to traditional IRA withdrawal rules once a beneficiary turns 18.Here's a closer look at the differences between these accounts. \"There is no reason to delay funding a 529,\" Canellopoulos says. If you have the means, you can fund both once the Trump accounts become available, but if you know you want to save for education, start with a 529, he says.529s funds can roll over into retirementIt may be easier to fund a 529 before a Trump account even if you do want to set aside money for your child's retirement, says Ajay Kaisth, a CFP and principal at KAI Advisors in Princeton Junction, New Jersey.Over a beneficiary's lifetime, up to $35,000 in unused 529 funds can be transferred to a Roth IRA in their name, provided the 529 account has been open for at least 15 years. These transfers are subject to annual Roth IRA contribution limits and the beneficiary must have earned income. Once in a Roth IRA, funds grow tax-free and withdrawals are tax-free after age 59½, as long as the account has been open for at least five years. Contributions, however, can generally be withdrawn tax and penalty-free at any time.Trump account beneficiaries have the option to convert their funds into a Roth IRA after their account becomes a traditional IRA. However, because these accounts may mix post-tax parental gifts with pre-tax federal grants and employer contributions, detailed record-keeping is essential, and converting could be a hassle, Kaisth says.\"If the goal is to fund a child's education and retirement, in my mind, a 529 plan becomes the more beneficial option,\" Kaisth says. Open a Trump account for the \"free money\" if you're eligible, but if you're looking for simplicity, fund the 529 first, Kaisth says. Ultimately, \"the earlier you start whichever, the better it is.\"Want to get ahead at work with AI? Sign up for CNBC's new online course, Beyond the Basics: How to Use AI to Supercharge Your Work.

    "body": "A worker drives a United Parcel Service (UPS) truck on Oct. 28, 2025 in Los Angeles, California.Mario Tama | Getty ImagesUnited Parcel Service on Tuesday announced that it was planning to eliminate an additional 30,000 jobs this year as part of winding down its partnership with Amazon and a multiyear turnaround plan.CFO Brian Dykes said on a call with analysts Tuesday following the company's quarterly earnings release that UPS plans to reduce total operational hours by approximately 25 million associated with the Amazon decline.\"In terms of variable costs, we expect to reduce operational positions by up to 30,000,\" Dykes said. \"This will be accomplished through attrition, and we expect to offer a second voluntary separation program for full-time drivers.\"UPS also said it has identified 24 buildings for closure in the first half of 2026, with additional closures possible later in the year. Last year, UPS closed 93 buildings, it reiterated Tuesday. The company is also planning to \"further deploy automation\" across its network, according to Dykes.The planned job cuts come after UPS eliminated 48,000 jobs last year, 34,000 of which were operational and 14,000 of which were management. The company had previously estimated those combined reductions to total around 20,000. In a Tuesday statement, representative for the Teamsters said its union workers \"still know [their] worth\" if UPS brings back its buyout program.\"We're perfectly happy for UPS to realize growth and cost savings on the backs of corporate managers so long as they uphold their contractual commitments to our members and reward the Teamsters who actually make the company run,\" the statement read.UPS is in the midst of a turnaround plan under CEO Carol Tomé, aiming to reinvigorate the business. Though Amazon was previously UPS' largest customer, the two companies are in the process of gliding down operations together. UPS said Tuesday it expects a total of $3 billion in savings related to the Amazon unwind.UPS reported fourth-quarter earnings Tuesday, beating Wall Street estimates and citing encouraging process in its turnaround efforts.Shares of the company were up 4% in morning trading.

    "body": "Courtesy: RythmChicago's United Center is stepping into new territory for live events, becoming the first major U.S. arena to offer cannabis drinks at its concessions.The arena — home tothe NBA's Chicago Bulls and NHL's Chicago Blackhawks — announced Tuesday a multiyear partnership with Rythm, a hemp-derived THC beverage company that makes Rythm and Señorita brand drinks, to sell the cans at concerts and live events.The beverages will be available for adults 21 and older and sold alongside alcohol and soft drinks.\"We're seeing consumers choose this at the liquor store, at venues, at restaurants, and so it's a time when consumers are looking for alternatives,\" said Ben Kovler, CEO of Green Thumb Industries, which owns a stake in Rythm. \"We know consumers want them,\" Kovler said. \"They believe in no hangovers, they want the alternative.\"Consumer interest in hemp-derived THC products has been steadily rising in recent years. According to a study conducted by consumer researcher Brightfield Group and cited by Bernstein, 14% of U.S. adults reported using some type of hemp-derived THC product in the first quarter of 2025, up from just 8% a year earlier. \"As we continue to evolve offerings for our guests, RYTHM's Chicago roots made its beverage line a natural fit for the United Center experience,\" said Joe Myhra, United Center's COO in a press release.The drinks will be available during concerts at the venue starting in early February and will serve as a test case for cannabis in mainstream venues even as lawmakers debate tightening rules around the category over safety concerns. Kovler said the product sales will be aligned with safety and compliance measures in line with Illinois law, though the company didn't specify serving limits or monitoring protocols. \"The American consumer is very familiar with self-dosing a drink, and self-moderating,\" Kovler said, \"unlike a [THC] gummy — it's hard for most Americans to eat only one gummy.\" THC regulation turmoilLast year, Congress passed a funding bill that included a THC cap effectively banning most hemp-derived THC products — the same category now being sold at the United Center — starting in November. Public health advocates argued the market had outpaced regulation, while industry groups warned a sweeping ban could disrupt billions in consumer sales. That legislation was followed by revisions to the 2018 Farm Bill, which added exclusions to the federal definition of hemp. In effect, the changes closed the so-called hemp loophole and could make many hemp-based THC beverages illegal in a matter of a months, barring further policy shifts. Lawmakers in both chambers of Congress have already introduced legislation to keep intoxicating hemp products legal until 2028. A separate bipartisan bill was also submitted that would set a regulatory framework for intoxicating hemp beverages and CBD products, giving the industry hope for change before the current expiration. \"The timing in government and rules is never good and is never clear,\" said Kovler. \"It remains murky, but we're guided by the consumer, and that gives us a lot of confidence betting on this now.\"Adding to the policy shake-up, the Trump administration last year moved to reclassify cannabis under the Controlled Substances Act — a shift that sent cannabis stocks higher and raised questions about taxation, banking access and federal oversight. While rescheduling primarily affects state-legal marijuana businesses rather than hemp-derived products, it signals growing willingness in Washington to revisit decades-old cannabis policy. If policy momentum continues, analysts say the door could swing open to more cannabis-related products entering mainstream venues, but with some risk. \"Investing in cannabis remains a volatile and challenging endeavor, and one that is not for the faint-of-heart,\" Bernstein analyst Nadine Sarwat wrote in a recent research note.

    "body": "Todd Lyons, acting director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, participates in a television interview outside the White House, in Washington, Nov. 3, 2025.Brendan Smialowski | AFP | Getty ImagesA top federal judge in Minnesota ordered the acting head of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement to personally appear at a hearing in Minneapolis on Friday to explain why he should not be held in contempt of court after his agency repeatedly violated judicial orders related to immigration enforcement actions.The three-page order issued late Monday to ICE acting Director Todd Lyons by U.S. District Court Chief Judge Patrick Schiltz was scathing, accusing federal immigration authorities of failing to comply with \"dozens of court orders\" in recent weeks, including one issued by the judge mandating a bond hearing for a detained immigrant.\"This Court has been extremely patient with respondents, even though respondents decided to send thousands of agents to Minnesota to detain aliens without making any provision for dealing with the hundreds of habeas petitions and other lawsuits that were sure to result,\" Schiltz wrote in the order.\"This Court's patience is at an end,\" Schiltz wrote. The judge said that the Department of Homeland Security and Lyons' agency, which is a division of DHS, \"have continually assured the Court that they recognize their obligation to comply with Court orders,\" and that they would take steps to honor those orders.\"Unfortunately, though, the violations continue,\" Schiltz wrote. \"Accordingly, the Court will order Todd Lyons, the Acting Director of ICE, to appear personally before the Court and show cause why he should not be held in contempt of Court,\" Schiltz wrote.CNBC has requested comment from ICE on the order.The judge called his order \"an extraordinary step.\"\"But the extent of ICE's violation of court orders is likewise extraordinary, and lesser measures have been tried and failed,\" Schiltz wrote.The order comes as Minnesota state officials press for ICE and other federal immigration authorities to cease aggressive actions rounding up undocumented people in Minneapolis and elsewhere in the state.Schiltz's order also came two days after federal agents fatally shot Alex Pretti, a 37-year-old ICU nurse on a Minneapolis street, and weeks after an ICE agent shot and killed mom of three Renee Good in her car. Both Pretti and Good were U.S. citizens.Those, and other incidents, have sparked widespread outrage in the state and nationally.Read more CNBC politics coverageTrump says he wants 'very honorable and honest investigation' of Alex Pretti killingDemocrats to Trump: Fire Kristi Noem or risk her impeachmentThe government is barreling toward a partial shutdown over DHS funding.

    "body": "A \"sale pending\" sign in front of a home for sale in Larkspur, California, Nov. 30, 2023.Justin Sullivan | Getty ImagesSerious headwinds in the housing market and the broader economy are tanking home sales at an alarming rate.More than 40,000 signed home purchase agreements were canceled in December, representing 16.3% of all homes that went under contract, according to Redfin, a real estate brokerage. That's up from 14.9% in December 2024. It's is also the highest share since Redfin began tracking this metric in 2017.\"High housing costs and rising inventory have made homebuyers more selective,\" said Chen Zhao, head of economics research at Redfin. \"Home sellers outnumber buyers by a record margin, meaning the buyers who are in the market have options and may walk away if they believe they can find a better or more affordable home.\" Get Property Play directly to your inboxCNBC's Property Play with Diana Olick covers new and evolving opportunities for the real estate investor, delivered weekly to your inbox.Subscribe here to get access today.There were roughly 47% more home sellers than buyers in the market in December (or 631,535 more, in numerical terms), according to a separate Redfin report. That is the largest gap in records dating back to 2013 and up 7.1 percentage points from the previous month. \"I call 2025 the year of the seller, because I had so many sellers reach out,\" said Ashley Rummage, a real estate agent from Raleigh, North Carolina, who participated in the most recent CNBC Housing Market Survey. \"They were reaching out because they had a lot of fear around the economy. They had a lot of uncertainty around the current administration, mortgage rates, affordability. These are all challenges this year.\"Regionally, Atlanta saw the most contract cancellations in December (22.5%), followed by Jacksonville, Florida (20.6%), San Antonio, Texas (20.6%), Cleveland, Ohio (20.2%) and Tampa, Florida (19.4%). Cancellations were the least common in the New York metropolitan area, San Francisco and San Jose, California.Pending sales actually dropped an outsized 9% in December from November, according to the National Association of Realtors, so the numbers were already low. Given the high rate of cancellations, closed sales in January and February are likely to be quite weak. ",

    "body": "Louis Vuitton store window display in Mitsukoshi department store in Tokyo, Japan, on Friday, April 4, 2025.Bloomberg | Getty ImagesLuxury conglomerate LVMH reported better-than-expected earnings after the bell on Tuesday and a second quarter of organic revenue growth, as the sector's recovering business in China starts to show up in balance sheets.Organic revenue grew by 1% in the fourth quarter, flat from the same period a year earlier. Over the full year, revenue declined 1%.The company reported fourth-quarter revenue of 22.7 billion euros, beating LSEG estimates of 22.2 billion euros. For the full year, revenue came to 80.8 billion euros.Excluding Japan, Asia saw a noticeable improvement in trends compared to 2024, with a return to growth in the second half of the year, the company said.Despite the improvement, CEO Bernard Arnault said \"2026 won't be simple,\" warning of an \"unforseeable\" and \"disrupted\" economic context.LVMH is the parent company of a range of 75 different luxury brands. Its fashion and leather goods division, which brings in the bulk of its profits and includes fashion brands like Louis Vuitton, Dior and Fendi, saw organic sales decline 5% over the full year, a larger decline than the 1% decline it logged a year earlier.In October, LVMH shares surged 12% the day after it reported that organic growth re-entered positive territory in the third quarter. The results, alongside those of peers, ignited investors' optimism that the gloom around luxury over the past two years, as Chinese consumers spent less, was beginning to turn around.\"After the reassuring Q3, market expectations have probably been raised higher for Q4,\" wrote Barclays analyst Carole Madjo ahead of LVMH's report.Madjo expects 2026 to continue to deliver recovery for the luxury space, with about 5-6% growth across the sector at constant currencies.The U.S. should remain the main growth driver, while China continues to stabilize, Madjo said. However, \"while investor sentiment is turning more positive on the sector, we remind that some risks remain as valuation is now more demanding; EPS upgrades are yet to come, and the return of aspirational shoppers is not guaranteed,\" she added.After booming in the early days of the Covid-19 pandemic, luxury brands diverged. Some, like LVMH and Gucci-owner Kering, which rely heavily on their fashion & leather divisions, suffered. But those that were more exposed to higher-end luxury, like jewellery, and typically attracted wealthier shoppers, fared better.This earnings season, the world's second biggest luxury company Richemont, the owner of Cartier and Van Cleef, reported an expectations-beating December quarter with sales in reported currencies rising 4% year-on-year. The result was driven by strong demand for its luxury jewellery in what Bernstein analysts call \"long-term structural appeal.\"Meanwhile, Burberry also beat sales growth expectations for the previous quarter, which CEO Joshua Schulman partly attributed to successfully attracting Gen Z consumers in China, where it has concentrated marketing efforts. \"The Chinese consumer may be showing positive signs, but as [Richemont's] quarter's sequential deceleration (albeit in the face of tough comps) in China highlight, the path to recovery remains unsteady,\" said Bernstein analyst Luca Solca.\"Luxury brands may no longer rely on a steady stream of newly minted luxury consumers to drive growth in the region, and must bridge a K-shaped economy elsewhere.\"",

Saul Loeb | Afp | Getty ImagesPresident Donald Trump on Tuesday said he wants \"a very honorable and honest investigation\" into the controversial killing of ICU nurse Alex Pretti by a federal agent in Minnesota over the weekend.\"We're doing a big investigation,\" Trump told reporters at the White House. \"I want to see the investigation, I'm going to be watching over it,\" he said. \"I want to see it myself.\"Shortly after Trump spoke, MS Now, citing three people briefed on the matter, reported that the Department of Justice had decided not to conduct a civil rights investigation of Pretti's death.\"And instead two units of the Department of Homeland Security will investigate their officers and the man they killed,\" MS Now reported.Trump's comments were the latest in a series of recent statements and moves by him and the White House that have sought to dial back his administration's initially bellicose comments on Pretti's killing on Saturday in Minneapolis.Pretti's death came weeks after an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent in the city fatally shot another U.S. citizen, Renee Good, as she attempted to drive away from another agent telling her to exit her car.On Monday, Trump said that Tom Homan, his administration's border czar, would go to Minnesota to manage ICE's on-the-ground operations there.

Both officials are Democrats who for weeks have been strongly critical of the Trump administration's surge of immigration enforcement officers to Minneapolis and elsewhere.On Monday, multiple news outlets reported that Greg Bovino, the Border Patrol commander at large, was leaving Minneapolis, where his comments on Pretti's death and other immigration-enforcement related issues had inflamed tensions.Bovino had claimed that Pretti, who had a licensed handgun on his person at the time of the confrontation with federal agents, may have intended to \"massacre law enforcement.\"Noem and Bovino's claims have been undercut by videos taken of Pretti's shooting, which shows him on the ground when he is apparently shot from behind by an agent.",

    "body": "A view of the snow covered streets as heavy snowfall blanketed Washington, D.C. on Jan. 26, 2026.Celal Gunes | Anadolu | Getty ImagesThe U.S. government is on the brink of a partial shutdown beginning at 12:01 a.m. ET Saturday in large part because of a second recent killing of a U.S. citizen by federal agents in Minneapolis. It would be different than last year's shutdown.The killing of Alex Pretti, a 37-year-old intensive care nurse, has galvanized fierce Senate Democratic opposition to a House-passed measure providing funding for the Department of Homeland Security and a slew of other agencies. The more-than-$1.2 trillion package cleared the House of Representatives last week and accounts for the bulk of government spending for the fiscal year ending Sept. 30.Democratic support will be required to pass the bill, which needs 60 votes to avert the filibuster in the Senate that Republicans control 53-47. Democrats are demanding the DHS portion be stripped in exchange for their votes, something Republicans have signaled they will not do.If the Senate alters the bill at all, it would have to be reapproved by the House, which is out on a prescheduled recess and has not announced plans to return before the deadline. In addition to DHS, the bill would fund the departments of Defense, Treasury, State, Health and Human Services, Labor, Housing and Urban Development, Transportation, and Education.Should the bill not pass by the Friday night deadline, those agencies would be deprived of funding and enter a shutdown posture — meaning \"nonessential\" employees would be furloughed and \"essential\" employees would work without pay. Spending bills that President Donald Trump already signed would keep the rest of the government open. \"Activities that are necessary to protect life and property continue, although the workers in those functions may not be paid while they are working,\" said Caleb Quakenbush, associate director of economic policy at the Bipartisan Policy Center. \"Agencies have a lot of discretion in terms of who is essential and at what period.\" Agencies typically release contingency plans before a shutdown. So far, the agencies at risk of losing funding have not publicly released their plans. Certain government functions like Social Security payments and Medicare and Medicaid services typically continue during a shutdown, Quakenbush said. The bill that reopened the government last year included funding for the Department of Agriculture through the fiscal year, meaning the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program will not see a disruption as it did last year.

A shutdown at the end of the week would be the first during tax season, which began Monday. The Internal Revenue Service is among the agencies that would lose funding during a shutdown. Last year, the agency remained open in some capacity during the shutdown but did have to wind down some operations as the shutdown dragged on.The IRS said in October that most tax refunds would not be issued during the last shutdown, with an exception for Form 1040s that are \"electronically filed, error-free tax returns that can be automatically processed and direct deposited.\"  IRS walk-in taxpayer assistance centers were also shuttered during the last shutdown. The Treasury Department did not respond to emails from CNBC seeking comment on the agency's contingency plans.The Department of Transportation would also be shuttered, though some key functions would remain functioning. Air traffic controllers would be required to work without pay. The Department of Health and Human Services would also be affected. Some Head Start programs were forced to close during the last shutdown, depriving families of critical child care. DHS, however, would be able to largely operate without interruption due to funding provided to the agency through the Republicans' \"One Big Beautiful Bill\" law enacted last year. That bill provided DHS with roughly $178 billion, which could be tapped to continue immigration operations during a shutdown. It's unclear whether the other agencies affected have identified similar pots of money that could be used to keep operations going. The length of a potential shutdown would also be critical in assessing how long those contingency funds would last.\"The longer they go on, the more disruption that people experience,\" Quakenbush said.

Those claims were later contradicted by video analysis and analyses from multiple news outlets. Trump on Tuesday said \"no\" when a reporter at the White House asked him if Noem would leave her post.Noem is doing \"a very good job,\" Trump told reporters before a planned trip to Iowa.The warning by House Democrats comes as a partial government shutdown looms amid concerns over DHS funding.\"Taxpayer dollars are being weaponized by the Trump administration to kill American citizens, brutalize communities and violently target law-abiding immigrant families. The country is disgusted by what the Department of Homeland Security has done,\" the leaders said in their statement.The House last week passed a more than $1.2 trillion spending package that included funding for DHS and other agencies. But the Senate has only until 12:01 a.m. Saturday to pass the bills and keep the government fully funded.The killing of Pretti, a 37-year-old intensive care nurse, has prompted outrage among Senate Democrats, who have called for the DHS bill to be stripped from the larger spending package in exchange for their votes.Democratic support for the spending bills is needed to clear the 60-vote filibuster in the Senate.\"Senate Democrats have made clear we are ready to quickly advance the five appropriations bills separately from the DHS funding bill before the January 30th deadline,\" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said in a statement Monday. \"The responsibility to prevent a partial government shutdown is on Leader Thune and Senate Republicans,\" Schumer said. \"If [Majority  Leader John] Thune puts those five bills on the floor this week, we can pass them right away. If not, Republicans will again be responsible for another government shutdown.\" Trump and the White House this week softened the administration's stance on Pretti, seemingly walking back earlier statements made by administration officials like Stephen Miller, Trump's homeland security adviser, who labeled Pretti a \"domestic terrorist.\"\"Nobody in the White House, including President Trump, wants to see people getting hurt or killed in America's streets,\" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said during a press briefing on Monday.Still, tensions remain high after the deaths of Pretti and Renee Nicole Good, another citizen killed by federal agents in Minneapolis this month.DHS recently launched an immigration enforcement investigation in Minnesota, sending federal agents to the state in response to an ongoing social services fraud scandal and targeting thousands of refugees.Minnesota state officials and congressional Democrats have sharply condemned the tactics used by DHS and ICE, and some congressional Republicans have also called for increased oversight.Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., on Monday called on the heads of ICE, Customs and Border Protection and U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services to testify before the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, which he chairs.He also called for an \"independent investigation\" into the shooting.\"That should happen immediately. I can't recall ever hearing a police chief immediately describing the victim as a 'domestic terrorist' or a \"would-be assassin,'\" Paul said in a post to X on Tuesday.   \"For calm to be restored, an independent investigation is the least that should be done,\" he wrote.ICE, CPB, and USCIS officials agreed Tuesday to testify at a House Homeland Security Committee hearing on Feb. 10.",

    "body": "Maskot | Maskot | Getty ImagesEfforts in Congress to create a federal \"click to cancel\" rule — intended to make canceling subscriptions as easy as it is to sign up for them — have ramped up.A bipartisan House bill called the Unsubscribe Act was introduced in mid-January as a companion to a Senate measure proposed in July. Among other provisions, it would require companies that offer subscriptions to provide easy cancellations and to get consumers' approval before charging them after a free or reduced-cost period.The measure joins two other bills floated in July — one in each the House and Senate — that generally would reinstate a click-to-cancel rule from the Federal Trade Commission that didn't take effect last year as scheduled due to a federal appeals court striking it down. The FTC's rule was similar to the Unsubscribe Act.Read more CNBC personal finance coverageTrump not a fan of using 401(k)s to buy homes.

Some economists disagreeCNBC's Financial Advisor 100: Best financial advisors, top firms rankedAlongside the congressional push, more than half of states now have some sort of law on the books that is similar in theme to the Unsubscribe Act and the FTC's rule, said Gonzalo Mon, a partner with the law firm of Kelley Drye & Warren in Washington.\"This does seem to be a bipartisan issue, and a lot of regulators are concerned about consumers getting into subscriptions without knowing all the details,\" Mon said.U.S. adults spend $1,080 yearly on subscriptionsSo-called \"negative option\" subscription contracts — those that automatically renew unless canceled by consumers — have generated a growing number of complaints over time as their prevalence and usage have increased. While these subscriptions are easy to sign up for, they can be difficult to cancel.In 2024, the FTC received an average of nearly 70 consumer complaints per day, up from 42 daily in 2021, according to the agency.Each year, U.S. adults spend an average of $1,080 on subscriptions, according to a 2025 survey by CNET, a media website focused on consumer technology. By generation, millennials spend the most annually: $1,215. The survey was conducted online in late April by YouGov and involved 2,440 adults.The average spent annually on subscriptions consumers no longer use is $205, according to the survey. Consumer groups push back against canceled FTC ruleThe FTC finalized its click-to-cancel rule in October 2024 under the Biden administration. It was quickly challenged in court by a range of business and trade groups, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the National Federation of Independent Businesses.About a week before the rule was scheduled to take effect last year on July 14, the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals vacated it on procedural grounds, \"not the merit of the rule,\" Mon said. Among the issues was that the FTC did not perform a proper economic impact analysis, Mon said.In November, two advocacy groups — the Consumer Federation of America and the American Economic Liberties Project — petitioned the FTC to renew the rulemaking process for the click-to-cancel rule.\"The American public continues to need robust protection against unfair and deceptive 'subscription traps' — the ubiquitous subscription practices that hook consumers into purchasing products or services with recurring charges and that are nearly impossible to cancel,\" the petition says.The FTC published the petition in the Federal Register on Dec. 3, with a public comment period lasting through Jan. 2.At this point, it's unclear whether the agency will restart the rulemaking process for its click-to-cancel rule.FTC's battle against cancellation practices continuesEither way, the FTC has continued to challenge subscription cancellation practices under a different authority, the Restore Online Shoppers' Confidence Act.In September, the FTC announced two settlements related to subscription cancellation practices. The agency reached a $2.5 billion settlement with Amazon over allegations that the company enrolled millions of consumers in Prime subscriptions without their consent and made it difficult for consumers to cancel.Separately, the agency reached a $7.5 million settlement with education-tech provider Chegg over allegations that it was difficult for consumers to cancel recurring subscriptions and that it failed to honor consumers' cancellation requests.Because companies offering subscriptions are likely to do business across the country, they are dealing with a patchwork of state laws that are not exactly identical.\"To the extent that companies are operating nationwide … they're figuring out what the most restrictive laws are and are tailoring their practices to those,\" Mon said.However, \"the Unsubscribe Act would not preempt state laws, so companies would have to comply with both\" federal and state laws, Mon said.It's uncertain whether the congressional proposals will gain traction or languish in committee.",

(Photo by Chance Yeh/Getty Images for HubSpot)Chance Yeh | Getty Images Entertainment | Getty ImagesAnthropic CEO Dario Amodei has issued a fresh warning about how AI will disrupt the job market, saying it will cause \"unusually painful\" disruption.The AI chief, who co-founded Anthropic in 2021 with his sister Daniela Amodei and is behind the creation of the AI chatbot Claude, warned AI would destroy half of all white-collar jobs last year. The issue has divided opinion among business and tech leaders. Amodei's warning prompted Nvidia's CEO Jensen Huang to say he \"thinks AI is so scary, but only [Anthropic] should do it.\"On Monday, Amodei published a roughly 20,000-word essay arguing the risks AI poses are not being taken seriously and warning the technology will lead to a \"shock\" to the job market, bigger than any before.Amodei set out what he regards as the potential harms of AI, including the tech becoming autonomous and unpredictable, bad actors or terrorist groups using it to create bio-weapons, and some countries creating a \"global totalitarian dictatorship\" by exploiting AI to gain disproportionate power.\"Humanity is about to be handed almost unimaginable power, and it is deeply unclear whether our social, political, and technological systems possess the maturity to wield it,\" Amodei wrote. In the essay, he elaborated on his argument that humans will find it difficult to recover from AI's impact on the labor market in the short-term. \"New technologies often bring labor market shocks, and in the past, humans have always recovered from them, but I am concerned that this is because these previous shocks affected only a small fraction of the full possible range of human abilities, leaving room for humans to expand to new tasks,\" Amodei said. \"AI will have effects that are much broader and occur much faster, and therefore I worry it will be much more challenging to make things work out well,\" he added.Short-term shockAmodei predicted that humans would be unable to adapt to AI development's rapid pace, and this would trigger an \"unusually painful\" short-term shock in the labor market.\"The pace of progress in AI is much faster than for previous technological revolutions,\" he wrote. \"It is hard for people to adapt to this pace of change, both to the changes in how a given job works and in the need to switch to new jobs.\" He said this was largely because AI's \"cognitive breadth\" meant it wouldn't affect one industry but could simultaneously wipe out jobs across finance, consulting, law, and tech, denying workers the option to \"switch lanes\" to another industry where their skillset was a match. \"The technology is not replacing a single job but acting as a 'general labor substitute for humans,'\" Amodei wrote.Tackling this problem, according to Amodei, will \"require government intervention,\" such as \"progressive taxation,\" which targets AI firms in particular.President and CEO of NVIDIA, Jensen Huang attends the 56th annual World Economic Forum (WEF) meeting in Davos, Switzerland, January 21, 2026. Denis Balibouse | ReutersAI eliminating jobs has dominated headlines in the past year. The technology was given as a reason for nearly 55,000 layoffs in the U.S. in 2025, per December data from consulting firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas.A study by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in November found AI can already do the job of 11.7% of the U.S. labor market, saving up to $1.2 trillion in wages across finance, healthcare, and other professional services.Consultancy firm Mercer's Global Talent Trends 2026 report, which surveyed 12,000 people worldwide, found 40% of employees feared losing their jobs to AI, up from 28% in 2024.But Deutsche Bank analysts said in a note last week that \"AI redundancy washing will be a significant feature of 2026,\" as major companies blame the technology for job cuts that actually have other causes. Yale University's Budget Lab said in an October report that AI hadn't yet caused widespread job losses, according to its analysis of U.S. labor market data from 2022 to 2025. It found that the share of workers in different jobs hadn't changed significantly since ChatGPT's debut in November sparked a surge of interest in AI.Others see job creation in blue-collar industries, for example, Nvidia's CEO Jensen Huang said AI is actually going to \"create a lot of jobs\" for plumbers, electricians, construction workers, and those building AI-related factories. \"And so we're talking about six-figure salaries for people who are building chip factories or computer factories or AI factories,\" he added.JPMorgan's CEO Jamie Dimon shared a similar view at the World Economic Forum last week, saying that governments need to come in at a \"local level\" and provide incentives to firms to retrain people and provide income assistance as AI takes over some jobs.",

    "body": "U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell holds a press conference after the Fed cut interest rates by quarter of a percentage point, in Washington, D.C., U.S., October 29, 2025. Kevin Lamarque | ReutersThis week's Federal Reserve meeting offers little suspense and probably not much action, even as massive changes loom over the central bank's longer-term direction.Judging by market expectations and policymakers' comments, there's virtually no chance the Fed will change its benchmark interest rate when the meeting ends Wednesday.Despite a recent spate of disagreements among Federal Open Market Committee members about the longer-term trajectory of monetary policy, the near-term stance likely will be one of patience as a series of cuts made last year work their way through the economy.\"Overall, the Fed just wants to stand pat. They feel they've got time to wait and see,\" former Fed Vice Chair Roger Ferguson said in a CNBC interview Monday. \"This feels like a wait-and-see meeting, and we should all be listening to see if there's any hint or a bias towards a future action.\"watch nowIndications of where the FOMC heads from here would come from the post-meeting policy statement as well as Chair Jerome Powell's news conference afterward. Markets currently expect the Fed to cut once or twice this year — most likely in June and December, according to futures market pricing gauged by the CME Group's FedWatch tool.However, the focus most certainly will lie beyond the interest rate decision and future guidance and into an unprecedented web of intrigue that surrounds the meeting.Storm around PowellFor one, President Donald Trump told CNBC last week that he may have narrowed down his search for Powell's successor to a single candidate, a nomination that could be announced this week and perhaps even timed to coincide with the Fed rate decision.\"If there is a single most likely window, it's during the January FOMC — particularly if Trump is lookingto redirect attention away from a Fed that didn't cut,\" Stephanie Roth, chief economist at Wolfe Research, said in a note. \"More broadly, the decision could come as soon as this week, or within the next couple of weeks.\"Also operating in the background: The Justice Department has served Powell with a subpoena seeking information on the Fed's massive renovation project on its Washington, D.C., headquarters. In an unusually candid videotaped statement, Powell called the probe a \"pretext\" for Trump's desire to bully the Fed into cutting rates even more aggressively than it has in recent months.There's uncertainty elsewhere, too, with Trump's effort to unseat Fed Governor Lisa Cook over mortgage fraud allegations in front of the U.S. Supreme Court last week, and Trump appointee Stephen Miran's term expiring Saturday. Fed governors can serve until they are replaced, so it's not clear how much longer Miran will stay on the board. He dissented from each of last year's three, quarter percentage point rate cuts, favoring even larger moves.So while the market will pay close attention to interest rate developments and indications, much of the scrutiny will go toward the ancillary events that have rocked the central bank.Political pressures\"While the Fed has been politically pressured to cut rates, it is not pressed by the data,\" wrote Gregory Daco, chief economist at EY-Parthenon. However, Powell \"is likely to refrain from commenting directly on the Department of Justice probe involving himself and the Fed, as well as the Supreme Court's pending ruling related to Governor Cook.\"That won't stop media members from asking, though.\"Powell will be asked about his video warning that Trump DoJ subpoenas and other actions seekto subject monetary policy to the 'preferences of the president,'\" Krishna Guha, head of global policy and central bank strategy at Evercore ISI, said in a note. \"We think he will stand by everything he said and express faith in the Supreme Court as the final arbiter of Fed independence.\"Absent further political developments, that will bring the focus back to policy.Markets will look to decipher whether the hold this month is hawkish, the precursor of an extended period of no cuts, or dovish, in which Powell and the committee indicate that more cuts are likely, just not now.Morgan Stanley's chief economist, Michael Gapen, expects to see a tilt toward dovish.\"We think recent stabilization in the labor market and solid activity data will be the main drivers behind the decision to pause rate cuts, while incoming data on inflation will keep the Fed confident enough about disinflation later this year to retain an easing bias,\" Gapen said in a note. \"We do not believe committee members are ready to signal an end to the cutting cycle.\"Gapen is also looking for several changes in the post-meeting statement, likely reflecting an upgrade to economic growth and a removal of language on increased downside risks to employment.

    "body": "The exterior of an Amazon Fresh grocery store is seen on December 12, 2024 in Federal Way, Washington. David Ryder | Getty ImagesAmazon said Tuesday it plans to sunset its Fresh and Go brick-and-mortar chains, marking a major pivot in the company's grocery strategy.  \"After a careful evaluation of the business and how we can best serve customers, we've made the difficult decision to close our Amazon Go and Amazon Fresh physical stores, converting various locations into Whole Foods Market stores,\" the company wrote in a blog post. Amazon said the closures are part of an effort to prioritize investments, though it hasn't given up on physical retail. The company still plans to roll out other brick-and-mortar concepts, including \"a mass physical store format.\" It will continue to operate its Fresh grocery service and invest in same-day delivery of groceries, the company said.The company said it expects to open more than 100 new Whole Foods locations over the next few years. It will also expand its line of Whole Foods Daily Shops, which are mini-markets that offer a smaller assortment of grocery items.Last month, Amazon received approval from local officials in a Chicago suburb to construct a big-box store that would offer groceries, household essentials and general merchandise. Amazon declined to share how many Fresh and Go workers will be impacted by the store closures. It said it's working to help employees find roles in its operations network, and that they will be eligible for a severance package.

In 2017, the company spent $13.7 billion to acquire Whole Foods, the largest deal in its history. Amazon debuted its Fresh grocery chain in 2020, with an eye toward mass-market shoppers. The rollout was turbulent in its early days, with Amazon opening a flurry of locations, before it shuttered some stores and halted expansion of the chain as part of broader cost-cutting efforts.The company launched a revamped Fresh store concept in 2023, and then continued to tweak its strategy. Amazon shuttered all of its U.K. Fresh stores last September, and closed a handful of locations in Southern California soon after.Amazon's Go convenience marts, which debuted in 2018, were a pet project of founder Jeff Bezos. The stores were designed to alleviate the headache of standing in a checkout line by allowing shoppers to \"Just Walk Out.\" Locations were outfitted with an array of cameras and sensors that tracked each item shoppers picked off the shelf and automatically charged them as they exited the store.\"No one likes to wait in line,\" then-CEO Bezos wrote in his 2018 letter to shareholders. \"Instead, we imagined a store where you could walk in, pick up what you wanted, and leave.\"The company shifted further away from the cashier-less technology in 2024 when it removed the systems from its grocery stores. In recent years, Amazon has sought to sell the software to other companies, primarily sports stadiums, concert venues, hospitals and colleges. It's also tested the automated grab-and-go technology in its warehouses. Amazon has brought the Whole Foods division closer to its in-house grocery teams since the 2017 acquisition. Last January, Amazon tapped Whole Foods CEO Jason Buechel to oversee its worldwide grocery business. The company also began testing a \"store within a store\" concept at some Whole Foods locations where customers can order a wider array of Amazon products that aren't typically offered at the upscale grocer from an automated warehouse affixed to the store. watch now",

    "body": "watch nowStock Chart IconStock chart iconHumana shares in the past dayThe proposal entails a net average payment increase of 0.09% for Medicare Advantage plans in 2027, according to a release from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, on Monday. That number is significantly less than Wall Street analysts' expectations that the agency would propose a rate increase of between 4% and 6% for next year. CMS typically finalizes Medicare Advantage rates in early April. If the current proposal holds, the rate increase would result in more than $700 million more in payments to Medicare Advantage plans in 2027, according to the agency's release. The closely watched government payment rate determines how much insurers can charge for monthly premiums and plan benefits they offer, and ultimately, their profits. The Wall Street Journal first reported about the government's rate proposal on Monday. Medicare Advantage is a privately run health insurance plan contracted by Medicare. More than half of Medicare beneficiaries are enrolled in such plans, enticed by lower monthly premiums and extra benefits not covered by traditional Medicare, according to health policy research firm KFF.CMS said it is also looking to slash a moneymaking industry billing practice. Part of the proposal aims to improve payment accuracy and ensure Medicare insurers get adequately reimbursed, the Journal reported. \"These proposed payment policies are about making sure Medicare Advantage works better for the people it serves,\" said CMS Administrator Dr. Mehmet Oz in the release. \"By strengthening payment accuracy and modernizing risk adjustment, CMS is helping ensure beneficiaries continue to have affordable plan choices and reliable benefits, while protecting taxpayers from unnecessary spending that is not oriented towards addressing real health needs.\" ",

The cases center around allegations that the design of several social media and streaming video apps like Instagram and YouTube harmed the mental well-being of teenagers and young adults, leaving them addicted to the services. The focus on the apps' alleged design flaws is part of a legal strategy to counter arguments made by the technology companies that certain content shared on their platforms is protected via the Section 230 provision of the Communications Decency Act.Last week, Snap, the parent company of the Snapchat social media app, reached an agreement to settle with the plaintiff, and is no longer part of the trial.Read more CNBC tech newsApple, Google host dozens of AI 'nudify' apps like Grok, report findsBlockbuster social media trial kicks off, with more to come this yearMeta inks deal to pay Corning up to $6 billion for fiber-optic cables in AI data centersTikTok blames data center outages for U.S. app problems, denies censorship claimsTikTok is still a defendant in other personal injury cases, attorneys for the plaintiff said.Next week, another major trial commences in Santa Fe, New Mexico, involving Meta. In that case, the New Mexico Attorney General alleges that the Facebook-parent company failed to safeguard its apps, resulting in the exploitation of children by online predators. Later this year, another major social media trial will begin in the Northern District of California involving TikTok, Meta, YouTube and Snap. In this federal case, the social media firms will argue against allegations that the design of the apps led to unhealthy and addictive behaviors in teens and children.Since TikTok's U.S. operations became an independent joint venture in order to satisfy a national security law, it has been hit by a wave of glitches and errors. The company said the stumbles were due to a power outage at one of its data centers. Some users have complained about the hiccups and have also claimed that the app was censoring certain political information.WATCH: TikTok finalizes deal to stay in the U.S.watch now",

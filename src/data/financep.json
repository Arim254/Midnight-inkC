    "body": "After 41 draws without a winner, the Powerball lottery jackpot has climbed to $1 billion — the seventh largest in the lottery's history.Even if you don't match all six numbers, smaller prizes of $1 million and $50,000 are still in play.If you somehow beat the odds and win a large cash prize, what happens next can be just as important as the win itself. That's because decisions you make in the first few days can leave you vulnerable to losing or mismanaging the prize.Here are five common mistakes experts say to avoid, starting the moment the ticket is in your hands.1. Handing an unsigned ticket to the store clerkUntil a lottery ticket is signed, \"the person who physically holds a winning ticket\" can claim the prize, according to the South Carolina Education Lottery, one of the state lotteries that administers Powerball.Participating state lotteries generally direct players to use validation tools — self-check terminals, mobile app scanners or official lottery websites — rather than relying on store staff. That guidance exists in part because store clerks have been caught stealing winning tickets.To prevent fraud, you'll want to sign the ticket in ink right away, state lotteries advise. It also can't hurt to have a photocopy or photo of the signed ticket, since it can help if your ticket is lost or misplaced, according to the South Carolina Education Lottery.2. Not keeping the ticket in a safe placeYou signed the ticket, but where do you put it? Because a winning ticket functions much like cash, you don't want to keep it in your pocket, wallet or lying on a desk in your home, says George Gagliardi, a certified financial planner in Lexington, Massachusetts.\"Holding the winning ticket before claiming it is akin to walking around town with $100 million in your wallet,\" he says.The official ticket needs a secure location. A common recommendation is to lock it in a bank safe deposit box or a personal fireproof safe or lockbox as soon as possible.3. Telling everyone about winningAnnouncing a big lottery win can invite financial requests, scams and unwanted attention, says Gagliardi. It's often safer to keep the news within a very small circle of trusted family members.Some state lotteries require winners to go public when they claim the prize, which is why it can help to consult a financial advisor, a lawyer and an accountant before coming forward, State Farm advises.They can walk you through payout options and, in some states, help set up a trust that allows you to claim the prize anonymously.4. Rushing to claim your prizeWinners are often given between 90 days and a year to claim a prize, depending on the state.Rushing to claim it can prevent you from building the advisory team you'll need to manage immense wealth. Without a lawyer, accountant and financial advisor experienced in large windfalls, you risk making costly decisions about taxes, investments and spending, State Farm reports.5. Deciding on the payout too quicklyPowerball winners must choose between two payout options: a 30-year annuity worth the full listed jackpot amount or a lump-sum cash payout that is roughly half the advertised prize. For a $1 billion jackpot, the annuity would pay about $33.3 million per year, according to USAMega.com.Each option comes with tradeoffs. The annuity provides guaranteed installments with a larger total payout over time, while the cash option gives you immediate access to a sizable sum that can be invested right away. Your age, estate planning needs and comfort with investment risk can all shape which payout structure makes the most sense. Consult a trusted financial professional who can help you make decisions based on your individual financial situation.It can also help to slow down before making a choice, since \"you will be in an emotional state for a while, and one wants to make decisions logically, not emotionally,\" says John Loyd, a certified financial planner in Texas.Want to give your kids the ultimate advantage?

    "body": "In Disney's \"Zootopia 2,\" detectives Judy Hopps and Nick Wilde find themselves on the twisting trail of a mysterious reptile who turns the mammal metropolis of Zootopia upside down.DisneyThe Walt Disney Co. tallied its second billion-dollar film of 2025 with the help of a determined bunny and mischievous fox.\"Zootopia 2\" is set to top $1 billion at the global box office on Friday, according to company estimates, joining the live-action remake of \"Lilo & Stitch\" as the only Hollywood-made films to cross the benchmark this year. Heading into the weekend, the film had tallied $232.7 million domestically and $753.4 million from international markets.\"This milestone means the world to us, because more than anything, it means audiences are coming to theaters for a shared experience of watching this movie on the big screen, everyone together, from all walks of life around the world — and that is a Zootopia dream come true,\" Jared Bush, chief creative officer at Walt Disney Animation Studios, wrote in a statement Friday.The only other film to cross the billion-dollar threshold this year is China's \"Ne Zha 2,\" which has collected $2.2 billion since its release in January, according to data from Comscore.\"With the evolution of global market trends in recent years, reaching $1 billion has become a little more of a novelty again,\" Shawn Robbins, director of analytics at Fandango and founder of Box Office Theory, told CNBC. He also noted the importance of the film's \"staggering success in China.\" Nearly $450 million of the global haul for \"Zootopia 2\" has come from the region so far — a massive figure considering China has decreased the number of American films it permits to play in its theaters and has threatened to restrict even more because of escalated tariffs.\"Zootopia 2\" had the highest animated opening of all time for a non-local title in China and broke the record for highest-grossing non-local animated film of all time within five days of its release in the country, Disney reported.The film's billion-dollar haul also highlights a transition in the domestic theatrical marketplace. PG-rated family films have outperformed PG-13 and R-rated films at the box office in 2025. So far, PG films released this year have generated $2.7 billion in the U.S. and Canada, while PG-13 films have tallied $2.5 billion and R-rated films have collected $2.4 billion.This shift started in 2024, when PG-rated films sold more tickets domestically than any other rated film for the first time ever. PG-13 films had dominated the space for decades, according to data from Comscore. \"With PG-rated films, it is often the kids who make the decision as to whether to hit the multiplex, and their influence can be seen directly in the numbers for the category that have hit all-time highs over the past couple of years,\" said Paul Dergarabedian, head of marketplace trends at Comscore. \"Equally impressive is that most PG movie tickets sold are at a child-friendly lower price point and therefore reaching these huge box-office milestones is made even more impressive.\"Disclosure: Comcast is the parent company of Fandango and NBCUniversal, which owns CNBC. Versant would become the new parent company of Fandango and CNBC upon Comcast's planned spinoff of Versant.",

    "body": "A tract of new tightly packed homes are viewed along the Boulder City Parkway on January 11, 2022 in Henderson, Nevada.George Rose | Getty ImagesHome values have been losing ground for much of this year, with previously huge annual gains shrinking to nothing. The result is that homeowners are losing equity.Borrower equity fell 2.1% in the third quarter of this year compared with the same period a year ago, or a collective $373.8 billion, according to a report from Cotality. This comes after years of steep gains in home prices and record equity. Even after the drop, homeowners still have an overall collective net equity of $17.1 trillion for homes with a mortgage. For the average homeowner, the third-quarter equity declines translate to a loss of $13,400. In addition, the number of homes in a negative equity position, meaning they are worth less than the mortgage on them, increased by 21% from a year ago to 1.2 million. \"As the pace of home price growth slows and markets recalibrate from pandemic peaks, we're seeing a clear shift in equity trends,\" said Selma Hepp, chief economist at Cotality. \"Negative equity is on the rise, driven in part by affordability challenges that have led many first-time and lower-income buyers to over-leverage through piggyback loans or minimal down payments.\"Get Property Play directly to your inboxCNBC's Property Play with Diana Olick covers new and evolving opportunities for the real estate investor, delivered weekly to your inbox.Subscribe here to get access today.Those in a negative equity position likely purchased their homes more recently, when mortgage rates were higher and prices had peaked. Homeowners have also been pulling more equity out of their homes, thanks to huge gains in the past five years. Home values are now roughly 52% higher than they were in January 2020, according to the S&P Cotality Case-Shiller national home price index. Even after mortgage rates increased in 2023, the average equity gain per homeowner was $25,000. In 2024, it was $4,900. Not every market, however, is seeing the same dynamic. Boston, Chicago and New York are all still in the positive, according to the Cotality report. The biggest losses were in Los Angeles, San Francisco, Washington, Miami and Houston, Texas.\"The future performance of highly leveraged loans will hinge on the strength of the U.S. economy and labor market,\" Hepp said. \"Even as expectations for continued price appreciation and economic resilience persist, it remains critical to closely monitor these loans in the months ahead.\"",

    "body": "US Federal Reserve Board Chairman Jerome Powell speaks during a news conference following a Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting in Washington, DC, on Dec. 10, 2025.Saul Loeb | AFP | Getty ImagesIn the Federal Reserve's battle between fighting inflation and limiting unemployment, the latter side carried the day Wednesday and could also have an edge heading into 2026 if labor market weakness becomes more evident through an apparent overcounting of jobs numbers.In the immediate term, worries over the employment situation meant a vote, albeit divided by a 9-3 margin, to lower the central bank's key interest rate by a quarter percentage point. Down the road, there are indications that policymakers will be more inclined to cut further if the labor market stays soft. At his Wednesday news conference, Chair Jerome Powell mentioned several times that there likely has been negative job growth in recent months, a condition that would argue for easier monetary policy.\"Gradual cooling in the labor market has continued,\" Powell said. \"Surveys of households and businesses both show declining supply and demand for workers. So, I think you can say that the labor market has continued to cool gradually, just a touch more gradually than we thought.\"At issue is a monthly estimate the Bureau of Labor Statistics performs of how the labor market is affected by businesses closing and opening. The estimate, known as the birth-death model, takes a guess at the jobs gained by openings and lost by closings.Powell said the model has probably overstated jobs by about 60,000 per month since April. With job growth averaging just shy of 40,000 in that period, an overstatement that size would equate to payroll losses of about 20,000 per month.Powell urges cautionThe chair called the discrepancy \"something of a systematic overcount\" that likely will see big revisions to job growth numbers.In September, the BLS released a preliminary benchmark estimate that job growth was overstated by 911,000 in the 12-month period preceding March 2025. A final count is scheduled to come out in February.In \"a world where job creation is negative, I just think we need to watch that situation very carefully and be in a position where we're not pushing down job creation with our policy,\" Powell said.Balancing support for the labor market with keeping inflation under control will be central to policymaking as the Fed enters 2026. Officials at this week's Federal Open Market Committee meeting expressed a broad divergence of opinion on where rates should head. Six of the 19 participants said they opposed the latest rate cut — two of them were among the 12 who vote — and seven indicated they don't see the need for any reductions next year, according to the \"dot plot\" of individual expectations.On the other side are those who think there is at least some room for further easing. That would point to greater concerns about the labor market, even as inflation holds above the Fed's 2% target. However, Powell said much of the inflation overshoot is coming from President Donald Trump's tariffs, whose impact is expected to wane as the months go on.Market sees more cutsShould the view hold that inflation is subsiding and the labor market is stumbling, the Fed would then be expected to tilt toward an easing bias, particularly with Powell leaving his position as chair in May. \"With the Fed's most influential members keeping a keen eye on the unemployment rate, we think that as long as labor demand wanes and [the] unemployment rate increases, the path will be cleared for additional cuts, despite the vocal opposition from the hawks,\" Natixis economist Christopher Hodge said in a note.\"Because we see the unemployment rate rising through Q1 2026, we think the Fed will continuing cutting to arrest further softening in the labor market,\" Hodge added, noting that \"we think a cut in January is more likely than not.\"Stocks rallied Wednesday and Thursday amid hopes that the rhetoric out of the FOMC was not as hawkish as feared. Still, futures market pricing is indicating the next cut won't come until at least April. Traders also are putting odds on two reductions in 2026, which is more aggressive than the dot-plot indication of one, with even a 41% probability of three moves, according to the CME Group's FedWatch measure.",

    "body": "watch nowEverything is bigger in Texas. That's also true for data center demand in the Lone Star State, where project developers are rushing to cash in on the artificial intelligence boom.  Cheap land and cheap energy are combining to attract a flood of data center developers to the state. The potential demand is so vast that it will be impossible to meet by the end of the decade, energy experts say. Speculative projects are clogging up the pipeline to connect to the electric grid, making it difficult to see how much demand will actually materialize, they say. But investors will be left on the hook if inflated demand forecasts lead to more infrastructure being built than is actually needed. \"It definitely looks, smells, feels — is acting like a bubble,\" said Joshua Rhodes, a research scientist at the University of Texas at Austin and a founder of energy consulting firm IdeaSmiths.  \"The top line numbers are almost laughable,\" Rhodes said. More than 220 gigawatts of big projects have asked to connect to the Texas electric grid by 2030, according to December data from the Electric Reliability Council of Texas. More than 70% of those projects are data centers, according to ERCOT, which manages the Texas power grid. That's more than twice the Lone Star State's record peak summer demand this year of around 85 gigawatts, and its total available power generation for the season of around 103 gigawatts. Those figures are \"crazy big,\" said Beth Garza, a former ERCOT watchdog.\"There's not enough stuff to serve that much load on the equipment side or the consumption side,\" said Garza, director of ERCOT's independent market monitor from 2014 to 2019. Rhodes agreed. \"There's just no way we can physically put this much steel in the ground to match those numbers. I don't even know if China could do it that fast,\" he said.  'Not all real'Data center requests have exploded in Texas since state legislation in 2023 required projects that have not signed electric connection agreements to be considered in power demand forecasts. The number of big projects requesting an electric connection has nearly quadrupled this year. But more than half of them, representing about 128 gigawatts of increased potential demand, have not submitted studies for ERCOT to review yet. About another 90 gigawatts are either under review or have had planning studies approved. \"We know it's not all real. The question is how much is real,\" said Michael Hogan, a senior advisor at the Regulatory Assistance Project, which advises governments and regulators on energy policy.The huge numbers in Texas reflect a broader data center bubble in the U.S., said Hogan, who has worked in the electric industry for more than four decades, starting at General Electric in 1980.  \"As with everything else in Texas, it's an outsized example of it,\" he said. The number of projects that have actually connected to the grid or have been approved by ERCOT is much smaller, at only around 7.5 gigawatts. It is still a large number, equivalent to nearly eight large nuclear plants. But Texas can meet that level of demand, Rhodes said. \"We could comfortably grow 8 gigawatts of data centers,\" Rhodes said. Texas might be able to meet 20 gigawatts or 30 gigawatts of data center demand by 2030, he said. Texas has acted to separate serious data center projects from those that are merely speculative. A law passed in May requires developers to pay $100,000 for the initial study of their project and show that a site is secured through an ownership interest or lease. And they have to disclose whether they have outlined the same project anywhere else in Texas. The Texas Public Utility Commission has proposed a rule that would require data centers to pay $50,000 security per megawatt of peak power. The cost to a developer would total at least $50 million for a gigawatt-scale data center. \"The serious developers with long-term contracts signed with anchor tenants, they're going to be willing to put that money down,\" Rhodes said. More speculative developers will likely drop out of the line for an electric connection, which will help authorities get a more accurate forecast, he said. Risk to investorsThe risk is that electric infrastructure such as power plants, transmission lines and transformers will be built for speculative data centers that either do not materialize or use less electricity than anticipated, Rhodes said. And overbuilding would come at time when the cost of that infrastructure has soared as data centers and other industries all compete for the same scarce equipment, he said.\"When the bubble bursts, who pays is going to depend on how much steel has been moved,\" Rhodes said. The cost of a natural gas plant, for example, has more than doubled over the past five years, he said. \"It's kind of like buying your house at the top of the market,\" the analyst said. \"If the house price goes down in five years, you're out of luck.\" watch nowThe cost of building new power plants to serve the Texas electric market is generally borne by investors, Rhodes and Hogan said, providing some protection to households from higher electricity prices if too much capacity is built.  By contrast, electric prices have spiked in some Midwestern and mid-Atlantic states from data center demand because the grid operator, PJM Interconnection, buys power generation years in advance — with the burden falling on consumers.  In Illinois, where the northern part of the state is served by PJM, residential electricity prices rose about 20% in September compared to the same month last year. But prices in Texas increased just 5% year over year, below the average national increase of more than 7%, according to data from the Energy Information Administration.  Texas has less risk of building too much generation compared to PJM states because of the way the market is structured, Hogan said. But \"whatever [new] build we do end up seeing in Texas, the people who ended up investing in the excess capacity are the ones that are going to suffer,\" he said.  ",

    "body": "Chicago Federal Reserve President Austan Goolsbee on Friday explained why he voted against this week's interest rate cut, telling CNBC that policymakers should have waited until they had more information before easing further.\"I'm pretty optimistic that for 2026 rates will will be able to be a fair bit lower than they are today,\" the central banker said during a \"Squawk Box\" interview. \"But I've just been uncomfortable front-loading too many rate cuts and assuming that what we've seen in inflation will be transitory.\"Goolsbee was one of three Federal Open Market Committee members to vote against the quarter percentage point reduction, the third consecutive easing measure. He was joined by Kansas City Fed President Jeffrey Schmid, as well as Governor Stephen Miran, who preferred a steeper cut.While he has said in the past he sees room for rates to come down further, Goolsbee said a lack of progress on inflation argued against moving now.Recent readings show the annual inflation rate around 2.8%, well above the Fed's 2% target.\"There's no way around we've been four and a half years above the inflation target, and the last six months have shown no progress,\" Goolsbee said. \"Right before the lights went out [for the government shutdown], you saw a couple of relatively disturbing readings on services inflation. I just want to make sure that if we believe that this is transitory, let's not just put all our eggs in.\"\"While I voted to lower rates at the September and October meetings, I believe we should have waited to get more data, especially about inflation, before lowering rates further,\" the policymaker said in a post on the Chicago Fed's website.Goolsbee will not be a voter on the FOMC in 2026 but will still participate in meetings.\"Given that inflation has been above our target for four and a half years, further progress on it has been stalled for several months, and almost all the businesspeople and consumers we have spoken to in the district lately identify prices as a main concern, I felt the more prudent course would have been to wait for more information.\" he wrote in a post on the Chicago Fed website. In the CNBC interview, he elaborated on his misgivings about cutting. While other Fed officials have expressed concern about the weakening labor market, Goolsbee said data has shown conditions to be \"pretty stable.\"\"I'm pretty optimistic that for 2026 rates will will be able to be a fair bit lower than they are today. But I've just been uncomfortable front loading too many rate cuts,\" he said in the interview. \"We don't take a lot of extra risk, in my view, to just wait to Q1 2026, and make sure that we're back on path at 2% inflation.\"The FOMC on Wednesday voted to lower its benchmark rate to a range between 3.5%-3.75%. In his post-meeting news conference, Chair Jerome Powell expressed worry that the labor market looks weaker than the headline numbers suggest, saying he expects official nonfarm payroll counts to be lowered and show losses in recent months.For his part, Goolsbee said he is \"one of the most optimistic people\" that rates will be lower in the year ahead.Schmid also released a statement Friday explaining his dissent. He also voted against a rate cut in October.\"Inflation remains too high, the economy shows continued momentum, and the labor market—though cooling—remains largely in balance,\" Schmid said. \"I view the current stance of monetary policy as being only modestly, if at all, restrictive. With this assessment, my preference was to leave the target range for the policy rate unchanged at this week's meeting.\"Earlier Friday morning, Philadelphia Fed President Anna Paulson, who will vote in 2026, said she views policy as \"somewhat restrictive\" and is more worried about unemployment than inflation.Also, Cleveland Fed President Beth Hammack said she would prefer policy \"on a slightly more restrictive stance\" to guard against higher inflation, according to Reuters.In total, six of the 19 participants at the Fed meeting indicated they opposed the cut, though only two were voters.",

    "body": "Customers walk in the parking lot outside a Costco store on Dec. 2, 2025 in Chicago, Illinois. Scott Olson | Getty ImagesCostco on Thursday surpassed Wall Street's quarterly expectations and posted year-over-year sales growth of 8.2% as the retailer attracted more digital sales and opened new locations.The warehouse club does not share a full-year outlook. On the company's earnings call, CFO Gary Millerchip said e-commerce gains were one of the strengths of the quarter. Digital sales jumped by 20.5% year over year. Traffic on its website increased 24% year over year and traffic on its app shot up 48%. Same-day delivery service offered through Instacart in the U.S. and Uber and DoorDash internationally grew at a faster pace than overall digital sales.Costco had a positive start to the busiest weeks of the holiday season, too. Millerchip said Black Friday was a record-breaking day for the warehouse club's U.S. e-commerce business, generating over $250 million in non-food orders.Here's how Costco did in its fiscal first quarter compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:Earnings per share: $4.50 vs. $4.27 expectedRevenue: $67.31 billion vs. $67.14 billion expectedCostco has attracted new members and higher sales at its clubs and online as U.S. consumers across incomes seek value while shopping for groceries, household essentials, holiday gifts and more. Along with its warehouse club competitors, Costco has gained traction with younger customers who are signing up for memberships. Costco has also benefitted from a membership fee increase in the U.S. and Canada, which took effect in September 2024, and kicked in as new members signed up or as existing customers' renewed their annual memberships when they lapsed.In the three-month period that ended Nov. 23, Costco's net income rose to $2 billion, or $4.50 per share, from $1.80 billion, or $4.04 per share, in the year-ago quarter. Revenue increased to $67.31 billion from $62.15 billion in the year-ago quarter.Comparable sales, an industry metric that takes out the impact of one-time factors like store openings and closures, increased 5.9% in the U.S. and 6.4% across the globe. Sales in non-food were led by pharmacy, gold and jewelry, tires, small electrics and apparel, which grew by double-digits year-over-year, Millerchip said.In the first quarter, Costco opened eight new warehouse clubs, including a relocation in Canada, its third location in France, four new locations in the U.S. and two additional Canadian business centers, CEO Ron Vachris said on the company's earnings call. Business centers tend to sell bulk items intended for restaurants and other types of businesses. Those additional locations bring its total store count to 921 around the world.He said the company plans to continue to open 30 or more clubs per year in future years.Read moreAs a warehouse club, Costco relies on membership fees to boost its revenue and help keep the price of its items low. With higher tariffs, however, the retailer has dealt with rising costs. About a third of Costco's U.S. sales come from imported goods.Inflation \"remained relatively consistent with recent quarters,\" Millerchip said. He said in grocery, Costco saw higher inflation in commodities such as beef, seafood and coffee, but that was offset by lower inflation in eggs, cheese, butter and produce. In non-food, he said Costco saw low single-digit inflation for the third consecutive quarter, primarily driven by gold and imported goods. Millerchip said on the earnings call that Costco has looked for ways to reduce the impact of the duties, including sourcing more items from the U.S., consolidating buying across the globe to lower the cost of goods and swapping out categories or items to ones that aren't as exposed to steep tariff costs.Its private label, Kirkland Signature, is another way to offset tariff prices because it has more control over the supply chain, he said.In late November, Costco sued the Trump administration to get a full refund of new tariffs that it has paid so far this year and to block those import duties from being collected from the company as it waits for a Supreme Court ruling on the duties.As of the end of the quarter, Costco had 81.4 million total paid members, up 5.2% year over year and 145.9 million cardholders, up 5.1% year over year, Millerchip said. Its renewal rate in the U.S. and Canada was 92.2% and its worldwide rate was 89.7%, slipping a bit as more customers sign up for memberships online and those members renew at a slightly lower rate.As of Thursday's close, Costco's shares have declined nearly 4% so far this year. That trails the S&P 500's 17% gains during the same period. However, over the past five years, Costco's stock has jumped by 141%. The company's stock closed at $884.48 on Thursday, bringing its market value to $392.67 billion.",

Date and context is unclear.Source: Democrats on the House Oversight Committee.Nearly 100,000 photos obtained by House Democrats from the estate of notorious sex predator Jeffrey Epstein include images of President Donald Trump, former President Bill Clinton, Microsoft founder Bill Gates, film director Woody Allen, and former Trump White House advisor Steve Bannon and others in social settings.Democrats on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, as they made the photos public, urged the Department of Justice to release investigative files it has related to Epstein ahead of the Dec. 19 deadline to do so to comply with a newly passed law.One image among a batch of photos released Friday morning shows Trump standing in the middle of a row of six women, whose faces were covered over by the Democrats before release.

    "body": "Workers are suspended on a Pepsi sign on a building outside of Allegiant Stadium ahead of LVIII in Las Vegas, Nevada, U.S., February 9, 2024.Brian Snyder | ReutersOne of this year's top food trends is facing some tough competition.Protein captivated consumers and food companies in 2025, but fiber is increasingly stealing the scene as people place an increasing emphasis on promoting gut health.It's taken hold on social media, where \"fibermaxxing\" — or the concept of increasing fiber intake through whole foods like fruits and legumes — has seen thousands of posts.\"Fiber is finally getting a spotlight, which is a great thing because it's a nutrient that people need,\" said Stephanie Mattucci, principal strategist at food research company Mintel.Currently, 90% of women and 97% of men in the U.S. are not meeting their daily fiber requirements, Mattucci said. For most Americans, that recommended range usually falls somewhere between 25 grams and 38 grams of fiber per day, she added.But more people are beginning to take notice of those gaps.According to Mattucci, 22% of consumers in the U.S. said high fiber content was one of their top three important factors when shopping for food — up from just 17% in 2021.Wall Street's companies are taking note, too. On an earnings call with analysts in October, PepsiCo CEO Ramon Laguarta said fiber was emerging at the forefront of the company's product goals as it looked ahead to 2026.\"I think fiber will be the next protein,\" Laguarta said. \"Consumers are starting to understand that fiber is the benefit that they need. It's actually a deficiency in U.S. consumers' diets, and that will be elevated.\"In February, the company is going a step farther and plans to launch Smartfood Fiber Pop, featuring six grams of fiber per serving, and SunChips Fiber, incorporating fiber variants like whole grains and black beans, Pepsi's chief science officer, Tara Glasgow, told CNBC exclusively.Smartfood Fiber Pop and Sun Chips Fiber snacks.Source: PepsicoAnd there's a reason companies are broadening their offerings. Research firm Datassential found that fiber is on track to be the \"next big health trend following on the heels of protein\" in its 2026 trends report.Of the consumers the firm surveyed, 54% said they are interested in foods and beverages that are high in fiber. That number is even higher — reaching 60% — among members of Generation Z, who are pioneering the \"fibermaxxing\" trend on social media.And 42% of consumers said they believe the attribute of \"high fiber\" on a nutrition label of any food or beverage product is important to defining that product as \"healthy,\" according to Datassential.It's that momentum that landed fiber as one of Whole Foods Market's top trends for 2026.The gut health crazeWatching fiber intake isn't new, experts note, but it's often been associated with older people who require it for health reasons as they age.\"When I think of fiber, I immediately think of my grandfather. Every day, he had his little baggie of All-Bran, and he brought it everywhere he went, probably out of necessity,\" Mintel's Mattucci said, citing the slowing of digestive tracts as people age.Still, something has shifted as consumers of all ages have started placing more emphasis on promoting gut health and digestive wellness — and fiber entered the spotlight.The emphasis on diversity of fiber intake and finding it in everyday whole foods rather than through supplements or powders is part of what's allowing it to find popularity and align with current culture, according to Angela Salas, a senior dietitian at the University of California, Davis.watch nowThe two types of fiber — soluble and insoluble — work together to keep people fuller for longer, improve digestion, and lower blood pressure and cholesterol, Salas said. In some ways, fiber could mimic the effects of weight-loss drugs because it takes longer to break down food and therefore sits in the stomach for longer, she said, which could be a factor for its recent popularity.\"These nutrients have always been around and always kind of shifts, I think, from the food industry saying, 'What can we highlight? What do people want to be focusing on so that we can continue to sell the same product, just slightly altered?'\" Salas said.Still, Kate Pelletier, a registered dietitian nutritionist at the University of Michigan Health, said it's important to note that fiber is not sufficient as an alternative to GLP-1 drugs, and a balanced plate is the best way to stay healthy.Pelletier said fiber's use as a \"street sweeper\" for the body is likely one of the reasons it's been thrust back into the spotlight.\"There's been a really big shift into more natural plants instead of popping a supplement or using a protein powder,\" Pelletier said. \"We can get the benefit of fiber from thinking about adding more wholesome foods into our diet, versus typical diet culture [which] focuses on taking out X, Y or Z.\" Promoting high-fiber productsFood and beverage companies are jumping on the momentum, too.Earlier this year, Coca-Cola launched its prebiotic soda, Simply Pop, with six grams of prebiotic fiber in five flavors to encourage gut health. Nestlé unveiled a new protein shake in June with four grams of prebiotic fiber designed specifically to support the digestive health of adults on GLP-1 medications.Other companies like Olipop have also entered the prebiotic soda market, boasting recipes that promote gut health, while smaller businesses, like Floura fiber bars and Sola Bagels, have also begun selling fiber-rich products.Olipop soda at a store in San Francisco, California, US, on Monday, March 17, 2025. Olipop Inc., the high-fiber, lower-sugar soda startup, raised $50 million in a Series C funding round at a valuation of $1.85 billion. David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesPepsi's Glasgow told CNBC the company is taking every opportunity to explore consumers' newfound interest in fiber. Glasgow said the research and development team's work starts in science and follows trends to keep up with their audience's evolving tastes.Pepsi already has products on the market that specifically boast high fiber content, like its prebiotic cola and Quaker oatmeal. As consumers start to explore the previously \"sleepy little nutrient,\" Glasgow said, Pepsi is innovating new products across its beverages and food brands.\"We hear it from consumers as well that they're becoming more knowledgeable about nutrition and their nutrition needs,\" Glasgow said. \"And I think that's where the excitement is coming from. I feel it growing.\"Glasgow said the company, which already launched successful protein-packed products this year, is moving toward products that incorporate multiple sources of gut-healthy ingredients.\"We saw protein grow in a big way in the last couple years,\" Glasgow said. \"I think [consumers] are then expanding their view, and they realize there's not one ingredient alone that is the silver bullet. It's about getting the right ingredients all together.\"For some, fiber isn't just a trend.Naomi Aganekwu, a 27-year-old content creator, said she started incorporating fiber more intentionally into her diet last year. Now, she makes sure each meal she eats has at least five to 10 grams of fiber through foods like beans, lentils and chia seed puddings.Aganekwu said she's seeing results from incorporating fiber into her diet, like being satiated after meals and seeing her hormonal acne reduce. And as she's championing fiber, she's seeing the people around her do the same, especially among her generation.It's become personal for Aganekwu, too, whose father died earlier this year of colon cancer. Some research has shown fiber could prevent colorectal cancer in addition to promoting overall health, according to the National Institutes of Health.\"You don't want to wait until you're 60 or 70 and you're dealing with more diagnoses,\" she said. \"There's a lot that you can do, even just in your everyday choices, down to what you're putting on your plate, that can directly impact your chances or decrease your chances of developing critical diseases.\"Correction: This story has been updated to reflect the level of fiber in Smartfood Fiber Pop.",

    "body": "Broadcom CEO Hock Tan.Lucas Jackson | ReutersBroadcom's quarterly results and guidance sailed past Wall Street estimates. It didn't matter. The chipmaker's shares plummeted 11% on Friday, on pace for their worst day since January, as investors ran for the exits on the artificial intelligence trade. Oracle dropped 4% a day after plunging 10% following its earnings report. Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices, the two leading makers of graphics processing units for AI workloads, slid about 3% and 4%, respectively. AI has been the driver for the stock market and the broader economy this year, so any negative sentiment has potentially far-reaching consequences. The Nasdaq on Friday fell about 1.4%, and the S&P 500 declined declined by nearly 1%. The companies getting hit the hardest are the ones most closely tied to AI infrastructure, which has been booming as hyperscalers build out their data centers to try and meet what they describe as insatiable demand for compute-intensive AI services. Broadcom makes custom chips for many of the the largest tech companies, and saw its market cap about double each of the past two years before rallying again in 2025.\"This stock is up 75-80% year to date. You're seeing a little bit of a pullback,\" Vijay Rakesh, an analyst at Mizuho, told CNBC's \"Squawk on the Street\" on Friday. \"We would be buyers on this pullback.\"Mizuho raised its price target on the stock to $450 from $435. It was trading below $364 as of Friday afternoon. \"This is still where the growth is,\" Rakesh said. \"They are still the big supplier to Google on their entire hardware stack, to Meta, to Anthropic and even OpenAI coming down the road.\" Broadcom reported revenue growth of 28% during the quarter, largely due to a 74% increase in AI chip sales, to a total of $18.02 billion, topping the $17.49 billion average analyst estimate, according to LSEG. Adjusted earnings per share of $1.95 adjusted topped the $1.86 average estimate.watch nowCEO Hock Tan said Broadcom expects AI chip sales this quarter to double from a year earlier to $8.2 billion, both from custom AI chips as well as semiconductors for AI networking.One concern among investors is that margins are coming down, at least in the short term, due to higher upfront costs. CFO Kirsten Spears said on the earnings call that \"gross margins will be lower\" for some of Broadcom's AI chip systems because the company will have to buy more parts to produce the server racks. Broadcom also said it had a $73 billion backlog of AI orders over the next 18 months. Part of that is from $21 billion of orders from Anthropic, which the company revealed as a key customer on Thursday.While OpenAI has been a highly touted customer following a multibillion-dollar agreement announced in October, Tan doused some hope for the deal, telling investors late Thursday that, \"We do not expect much in '26.\" Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon said in a note on Friday that \"AI angst\" was driving Broadcom's shares lower.\"Frankly we aren't sure what else one could desire as the company's AI story continues to not only overdeliver but is doing it at an accelerating rate,\" Rasgon, who recommends buying the stock and raised his price target, wrote in the note. Oracle has been facing more extreme skepticism. The stock is now down more than 40% from its record reached in September. The company beat on earnings but missed on revenue in its report on Wednesday, and investors were disappointed they didn't get more detail on how Oracle will finance its massive buildout that so far has required mounds of debt. CoreWeave, which is investing in data centers to offer cloud-based AI services, sank 9% on Friday and has lost more than half its value since peaking in June.

    "body": "watch nowStock Chart IconStock chart iconTilray Brands, 1-dayPresident Donald Trump is expected to issue an executive order as soon as Monday that would allow for reclassification of weed, a source familiar with the matter told CNBC. Such a move would allow cannabis companies to fall under different tax regulations and encourage investment.Cannabis stocks took a leg up in Friday's midday trading following CNBC's report.The Washington Post first reported on Thursday that Trump was expected to use an executive order to instruct federal agencies to reclassify marijuana as a less regulated Schedule III drug from a Schedule I. Axios reported the potential reclassification of pot — out of a group that includes heroin and into a lower tier of less dangerous drugs, such as steroids and Tylenol with codeine — would take place early next year.Trump previously floated a change in marijuana's classification in August.\"Trump rescheduling marijuana was not an if, in our assessment, but a when,\" Ed Groshans of Compass Point, a middle-market investment bank, wrote to clients in a Friday note.More optimismGroshans said the reported change would be \"positive\" for the cannabis industry, allowing banks to serve the sector.If Trump orders cannabis to be rescheduled, Groshans anticipates the Drug Enforcement Administration would finalize a proposed rule for the reclassification by the summer.Bill Kirk, senior research analyst at Roth, said he's also monitoring whether the Supreme Court decides next week to hear a case on state regulations and federal prohibition of cannabis. A positive ruling for the industry in that case could speed up regulatory timelines.The industry sees the latest moves as a sign of progress to normalize pot under national law.\"I'm a lot more optimistic than I ever have been,\" Tilray CEO Irwin Simon told CNBC. Shawn Hauser, partner at cannabis-focused law firm Vicente LLP, said a reclassification would mark only a \"partial victory,\" as the sector will need to continue fighting for legalization. However, she said the momentum can press Congress to create a regulatory framework that offers broader changes around safety, access and criminal justice reform than what a rescheduling provides.\"This the beginning of a new era of public health policy,\" Hauser said. \"If implemented, it dismantles nearly a century of outdated drug policies that fly in the face of science and medicine.\"Pot stocks have struggled since a brief mania around public growers and dispensaries in the years before Covid, even as cannabis has received broader acceptance and easier state classifications.Tilray shares were recently trading at a little more than $10 after peaking at more than $2,140, adjusted for splits, in September 2018. The Amplify Cannabis ETF is still on track to lose more than 8% in 2025, its fifth straight down year.",

    "body": "Rivian CEO RJ Scaringe at the company's first \"Autonomy and AI Day\" on Dec. 11, 2025, in Palo Alto, California.Lora Kolodny | CNBCRivian Automotive impressed Wall Street on Thursday with its plans for artificial intelligence, automation and an internally developed silicon chip, but significant challenges involving demand and capital remain for the electric vehicle maker.Despite Wall Street analysts expressing some optimism following Rivian's first \"Autonomy and AI Day,\" the company's stock fell 6.1% to close Thursday at $16.43 per share. But shares recovered during intraday trading Friday and were up more than 15%. While the event didn't cause many analysts to change ratings or price targets, Needham raised its price target on Rivian by 64% to $23 per share. The firm did so on the tech announcements and potential for future licensing deals, as well as higher-than-consensus expectations on deliveries next year of the company's new midsize R2 SUV.Read more\"RIVN signaled a shift from an [automaker] adopting autonomy to one leveraging AI to build end-to-end autonomy,\" Needham analyst Chris Pierce said in a Friday investor note.The company's stock had ramped up heading into the AI Day, but many analysts believed the announcements from the event were already \"priced in.\" Shares also fell as OpenAI made its own AI announcement Thursday, revealing its most advanced model yet.\"We attended Rivian's Autonomy & AI Day yesterday in Palo Alto and came away mostly impressed with the strategic direction outlined by management,\" Deutsche Bank analyst Edison Yu said Friday in an investor note. \"However, the stock's weakness seems warranted given the run-up since earnings and lack of a major AI partnership/deal announcement.\"Rivian's announcements included a proprietary chip, RAP1, designed for \"physical AI,\" namely autonomous driving; an evolved software architecture, or \"brains\" of the vehicle; a new AI assistant; and a road map for getting to \"personal L4,\" or fully self-driving personally owned vehicles.The latter begins later this month with an update involving its hands-free driving system, followed by plans to continue to expand capabilities until vehicles reach full autonomy in the years ahead. Rivian did not disclose a time frame for the full autonomy or potential robotaxi fleet autonomous vehicles.watch nowLeading up to the event, Rivian shares were up more than 30% to $17.50. Despite those gains, shares remain well off the levels of the company's IPO of $78 per share in 2021.Barclays analyst Dan Levy and others said while Rivian's technology announcements, including the surprise proprietary chip, were impressive, the company remains a \"show me\" story amid more challenging market conditions.\"With RIVN facing a tougher path to breakeven on core vehicle sales alone, we believe with enhanced AV/AI capabilities RIVN is further paving the path to additional software/service revenues, which would be margin accretive,\" Levy said Friday in an investor note. \"To be clear, there is certainly a 'show me' element for RIVN on its capabilities.\"Challenges include slumping EV demand following the end of up to $7,500 tax credits in September, lack of other support under the Trump administration and internal struggles at the company involving products and capital.Several analysts noted the adoption of advanced driver assistance systems remains low across the industry, even at U.S. EV leader Tesla, and Rivian is continuing to play catch-up to other companies that have offered such systems for years.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconShares of \"pure EV\" plays Tesla, Rivian and Lucid in 2025.Rivian founder and CEO RJ Scaringe and other executives argued that the company's vertical integration of in-house capabilities including software, AI, vehicle platforms and other technologies will enable the automaker to be more efficient, quicker and better than others.\"AI is enabling us to create technology and customer experiences at a rate that is completely different from what we've seen in the past,\" Scaringe said during the event.Such arguments, as well as the automaker's prior $5.8 billion joint venture software deal with Volkswagen, have led Wall Street to price Rivian's software business higher than its core of producing and selling EVs, given market conditions.A $12 price target for Rivian shares from Morgan Stanley, which recently downgraded the company to underweight, includes $7 for software and services and $5 for its core automotive business. Several analysts added that Rivian might be able to license or sell its newest technologies, including chips.\"RIVN is developing a suite of hardware and software offerings to remain competitive in an Auto 2.0 world. However, several risks remain around demand, potentially limiting data capture needed to reach higher levels of autonomy,\" Morgan Stanley's Andrew Percoco said in a Friday note. Morgan Stanley raised concerns about autonomy adoption rates, lackluster EV demand ahead of Rivian's new \"R2\" vehicle next year and a prolonged path to profitability as reasoning for the rating confirmation.Rivian R2 is showcased at the company's first Autonomy and AI Day showcasing developments in self-driving technology, in Palo Alto, California, Dec. 11, 2025.Carlos Barria | ReutersRBC Capital Markets analyst Tom Narayan agreed: \"The advancements enhance Rivian's product offering but do not address ongoing concerns around liquidity and R2/R3 profitability.\"Rivian continues to lose billions of dollars annually, despite significant cost reductions and gains in software revenue thanks to its deal with VW. Rivian ended the third quarter with $7.7 billion in total liquidity, including nearly $7.1 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments that Scaringe has said position the company \"really well\" for the R2 launch.The R2 midsize SUV is crucial for Rivian — especially since it's a major market in the U.S. With expectations of a $45,000 starting price, it is anticipated to broaden Rivian's customer base and be a proof-point for the company's efforts regarding profitability and cost savings. Rivian's current R1 pickup truck and SUV consumer models start at more than $70,000. It also builds electric delivery vans, largely for its biggest shareholder, Amazon, that start at around $80,000.\"Profitability pressure will likely intensify as Rivian rolls out its ~$45K R2 platform in the highly competitive mid-size SUV segment,\" Narayan said. \"While targeting a lower price point could increase market reach, the R1 platform's struggles with profitability despite being nearly double the price of the R2 raise.\"Shares of Rivian, with a $22.5 billion market cap, are rated hold with a $15.43 per share price target, according to average ratings and estimates compiled by FactSet.— CNBC's Michael Bloom contributed to this report.",

    "body": "Calvin McDonald, CEO of lululemon athletica inc., is interviewed by CNBC on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York City, U.S., March 29, 2023. Brendan Mcdermid | ReutersLululemon shares jumped more than 9% on Friday, after the company announced its CEO Calvin McDonald will step down. McDonald's departure, effective Jan. 31, follows more than a year of underperformance at the athleisure company. Lululemon's board of directors is working with a \"leading executive search firm\" to identify its next CEO, it said in a news release. McDonald will stay on as a senior advisor through March 31. \"The timing is right for a change,\" McDonald said on a call with analysts, \"I've described being CEO of Lululemon as my dream job. It truly has lived up to every expectation and given me the opportunity of a lifetime.\"Lululemon's CFO Meghan Frank and Chief Commercial Officer André Maestrini will serve as interim co-CEOs during the search process. The company's board chair Marti Morfitt will also take on the expanded role of executive chair. In a statement, she said the company has a strong foundation in place but needs a new leader that can guide it through a transition.\"As we look to the future, the Board is focused on identifying a leader with a track record of driving companies through periods of growth and transformation to guide the company's next chapter of success,\" said Morfitt.The leadership change follows more than a year of underperformance at Lululemon and calls for change from its founder and its largest independent shareholder Chip Wilson. Two months ago, he took out a full page ad in the Wall Street Journal saying the company is \"in a nosedive\" and it needed to \"stop chasing Wall Street at the expense of customers.\" Lululemon announced McDonald's departure on the same day it posted fiscal third-quarter earnings and another round of weak guidance. Here's how the company did compared with what Wall Street was anticipating, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:Earnings per share: $2.59 vs. $2.25 expectedRevenue: $2.57 billion vs. $2.48 billion expectedThe company's reported net income for the three-month period that ended Nov. 2 was $306.84 million, or $2.59 per share, compared with $351.87 million, or $2.87 per share, a year earlier. Sales rose to $2.57 billion, up from $2.40 billion a year earlier. For Lululemon's current quarter, McDonald said the company is \"encouraged\" by its early performance so far this holiday season — though guidance fell short of Wall Street estimates. It anticipates sales will be between $3.50 billion and $3.59 billion, largely below expectations of $3.60 billion, according to LSEG. It's expecting earnings per share to be between $4.66 and $4.76, well short of expectations of $5.03, according to LSEG. In the previous two quarters, Lululemon cut its full-year guidance. On Thursday, more than a month into the final quarter of the year, it raised its full-year expectations. It now anticipates sales will be between $10.96 billion and $11.05 billion, in line with expectations at the low end, according to LSEG. It expects earnings per share to be between $12.92 and $13.02, roughly in line with estimates of about $13, according to LSEG. The company saw strong demand during its Thanksgiving weekend, which allowed it to clear through stale inventory at a discount, said McDonald. \"I also want to acknowledge we've seen trends slow a bit since Thanksgiving, which we've taken into account in our Q4 guidance,\" said McDonald. \"However, despite this, we expect revenue trends in the U.S. and Q4 to be modestly improved relative to Q3.\" Lululemon's business has been under pressure over the last year as it navigates the impact of tariffs, a shaky U.S. consumer and a product assortment that's failed to wow shoppers in the same way it once did. It's also facing steep competition in the athleisure space from upstarts like Vuori and Alo Yoga as well as a change in consumer preferences. Instead of yoga pants, these days many shoppers are reaching for denim. To drive growth and reach a wider audience, Lululemon has been working to expand its business internationally and offer shoppers a wider assortment. Instead of just workout gear, Lululemon has expanded into shoes, outerwear like coats and jackets and casual pants that can be worn at work. The company's overall business is growing, but the expansion has largely come from its international business and new store openings. Its largest market, the Americas, has been declining. During the quarter, revenue in the Americas decreased 2%, with comparable sales down 5%, while international sales jumped 33%. Comparable sales abroad increased 18%. Lululemon is also being hit by the end of the de minimis exemption, which allowed low value packages to enter the U.S. duty free, a bit more acutely than its peers. In September, it said it expects tariffs to hit its full year profits by $240 million and most of those costs will come from the de minimis exemption ending. Following progress with vendor negotiations and other mitigation efforts, it now expects tariffs to reduce its profits by $210 million.

    "body": "U.S. President Donald Trump looks on, as he signs an executive order on AI in the Oval Office at the White House in Washington, D.C., U.S. Dec. 11, 2025.Al Drago | ReutersPresident Donald Trump signed an executive order Thursday issuing a single regulation framework for artificial intelligence, undermining the power of individual states. \"To win, United States AI companies must be free to innovate without cumbersome regulation,\" the order says. \"But excessive State regulation thwarts this imperative.\"The Trump administration, with the aid of AI and crypto czar David Sacks, has been pursuing a path that would allow federal rules to preempt state regulations on AI, a move meant to keep big Democratic-led states like California and New York from exerting their control over the growing industry. Sacks and fellow tech investor and podcaster Chamath Palihapitiya stood beside Trump during the signing in the Oval Office. He was also joined by Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick.The move marks a win for tech companies like OpenAI and Google and venture firm Andreessen Horowitz that have lobbied to limit regulations they view as overly burdensome. AI companies have been opening offices close to the Capitol and launching campaigns through a super PAC with at least $100 million to spend on the midterm elections in 2026. Proponents of a federal rule have argued that different regulations across the country would hinder the U.S. in its effort to compete in the global AI race. A draft version of a proposed executive order surfaced last month, for a single federal standard on AI \"instead of a patchwork of 50 State Regulatory Regimes.\"A proposed 10-year ban on states regulating AI was initially included in the Republican spending bill but was cut out before Trump signed it in July.Trump's executive order also calls for the attorney general to establish an AI Litigation Task Force, \"whose sole responsibility shall be to challenge State AI laws.\"States that don't adhere to the rules could face funding restrictions. The order says that within 90 days of its signing, the secretary of commerce must specify the conditions under which states may be eligible to receive remaining funding under the Broadband Equity Access and Deployment, or BEAD, program, a $42.5 billion effort to expand high-speed access in rural areas.

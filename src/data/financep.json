    "body": "Greg Hart, President and CEO of CourseraCourseraWith entry-level jobs declining as employers continue to deploy AI, Coursera's CEO has shared his top tips for graduates to stay competitive in the job market and stand out in interviews. Greg Hart, former technical advisor to Jeff Bezos at Amazon, became president and CEO of online learning platform Coursera in February 2025. He told CNBC Make It that in the age of AI, it's important for young people to pursue additional learning alongside a degree. \"The advice that I give to my sons... is one of the best things that you can do is to augment your university degree with micro credentials specifically,\" he said in the interview. Micro credentials are short courses that provide a certification for a specific skill or knowledge and they take less time to complete than a traditional degree or diploma. It's become increasingly important to supplement degrees with additional certifications, as graduate jobs are at risk of being replaced by AI, Hart said. Major firms have been laying off staff this year and have cited AI as part of the reason, from Amazon making 14,000 workers redundant as it bets on AI to Salesforce slashing 4,000 customer support roles saying AI can do 40% of the tasks at the company. \"Say you're a young person in university right now, you are generally going to get hired into your first job based primarily on the traits that they see in you.\"Greg HartPresident and CEO of CourseraMeanwhile, 62% of U.K. employers anticipate that junior, clerical, managerial and administrative roles will be the most likely be lost to AI, according to a recent survey of 2,019 senior HR professionals and decision makers by the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development (CIPD.)Additionally, the U.K.'s Institute for Student Employers found in its annual Student Recruitment Survey that 1.2 million applications were submitted for just 17,000 graduate roles, highlighting the intense competition and the limited positions available to young people. \"They [micro credentials] demonstrate to employers that not only did you get whatever university degree you're studying, but you augmented that with something that is generally much more workforce focused,\" Coursera's Hart added. As AI dominates, many workers are pursuing upskilling opportunities with LinkedIn's Skills on the Rise report, earlier this year finding that AI literacy was the most popular skill that people were adding to their profiles. 'Hiring you for your traits' Hart explained that fresh graduates going into job interviews should highlight their personality and character traits alongside their experience. \"Say you're a young person in university right now, you are generally going to get hired into your first job based primarily on the traits that they see in you,\" Hart said. \"They're going to be assessing your mindset and your traits as a human being more than your experience, because by definition, you really don't have much experience and so they're not really hiring you for your experience, they're hiring you for your... personality traits.\" Hart outlined that \"one of the most important traits\" that employers want to hire for are \"people who are proactive and hard working and take initiative, who prove to be ready, learners.\" The best way to show these traits is having micro credentials alongside your degree, especially ones that are tailored to your field. For example, Hart encouraged his son, who is a finance major, to take an additional course on AI for finance. In fact, experts previously told CNBC Make It that workers who have been laid off as a result of AI should train themselves up on new skills including increasing AI literacy via short courses, rather than pursuing a new degree which would be more costly and time consuming. Having the dedication to pursue additional learning demonstrates that you will also bring those traits to the job, they told CNBC. ",

    "body": "Ina Garten is an expert on making major career changes: she built a multimillion-dollar culinary empire after she quit her government job to open a food store.Garten's husband Jeffrey gave her sage advice when she decided to leave her previous career, she told Amy Poehler in a Nov. 25 episode of her podcast \"Good Hang with Amy Poehler.\"\"I said to Jeffrey, I really need to find something else to do. And he said, 'Just pick something fun. Pick something that you think you'd love doing, and if you love it, you'll be really good at it,'\" Garten said.She purchased her first store, Barefoot Contessa, in Westhampton Beach, New York in 1978.Managing her own store was difficult at first, Garten said. She had to \"learn very quickly how to be a boss,\" and she struggled to find her leadership style.\"A friend gave me the advice, your employees need two things from you. They need you to be clear, and they need you to be happy,\" Garten said. From then on, Garten practiced being more direct with her instructions – \"I need these candies bagged, and I need them wrapped up like this\" — and she resolved to not let her bad days \"disturb the energy in the room\" at the store. \"That was the best lesson I ever had for business,\" Garten recalled.How she delivers criticism Garten has a \"very clear\" rule about giving feedback to her employees: \"If I'm criticizing you, I'll take you out of the room and discuss what you can do better. If I'm complimenting you, I'll do it with everybody around.\"Though Garten tries to avoid firing people — \"I usually give them a lot of warning, explain what they have to do better,\" she said — sometimes the job just isn't the right fit. Learning how to let employees go was also a leadership skill Garten had to hone.A month into running Barefoot Contessa, Garten realized that one of her young employees was \"just dreadful\" at her job.\"She was just very sweet, but not very good,\" Garten said, so she decided to fire her.\"I took her out in the back and I explained that, you know, I'm sure there are other jobs that you're good at. This isn't the one,\" Garten told Poehler. Her delivery \"was so gentle, because I was so worried about hurting her feelings,\" Garten said, but she failed to get her point across to the employee.\"The next day she showed up for work again. She didn't know she was fired,\" Garten laughed. Garten didn't have the heart to attempt to fire the employee again, so she allowed her to stay on for the rest of the summer.Now, Garten has mastered the art of firing people in a kind, but firm manner: she said she fires people \"in a way that makes them say thank you and kiss me when they leave.\"Garten also prioritizes transparency as a leader. When Garten lets an employee go, she calls together the rest of her team to explain what happened, she said.She always worries that other employees will be upset with her for firing their colleague, she told Poehler, but \"100% of the time they're like, 'Oh, [they were] such a pain in the neck. We hated working with them. I'm so glad you fired them.'\"Black Friday sale: Want to up your AI skills and be more productive? Get 25% off our most popular course of the year, How to Use AI to Be More Successful at Work, with coupon code GETSMART.

    "body": "Coffee prices were already rising following poor harvests last year when the U.S. added new tariffs on coffee imports in April. Those tariffs have since been rolled back, but prices at grocery stores and cafés are still high, leaving many shoppers wondering why a simple cup of coffee costs so much.As of September, roasted coffee sold in stores cost about 41% more than it did 12 months prior, rising from an average of $6.47 to $9.14 per pound, according to the most recent Bureau of Labor Statistics data.While prices can swing by roughly a dollar within a year during volatile periods, the nearly $3 increase in the most recent BLS data is unusually steep — and consumers are taking notice.\"This is ridiculous,\" 52-year-old Chuck Smith said in a TikTok video in August in which he showed receipts for the 38.2-ounce tub of Maxwell House ground coffee he buys at his local Walmart in Indiana, which had nearly doubled in price to $21.44 in under a year.Smith says he filmed the clip spontaneously in the grocery aisle after noticing the price hike. \"It was just me in the moment,\" he told CNBC Make It, adding that the reaction \"captured what a lot of folks are feeling.\" Walmart and Kraft Heinz, the maker of Maxwell House, did not respond to requests for comment. Other brands, including Nespresso and Folgers, have also increased prices in the last year.Restaurant coffee prices have risen, too: The average cost of a regular cup increased from $3.46 to $3.57 in the year ending October 2025, according to restaurant and café price data tracked by menu software company Toast.What's behind the biggest coffee price spike in decadesThe run-up in average retail coffee prices has been the steepest and most sustained since BLS began tracking those prices in 1980, the data shows.Weather issues came first. Drought and heavy rain disrupted harvests in Brazil and Vietnam in 2024, tightening supply well before tariffs took effect.Coffee futures prices then climbed from roughly $2 a pound in May 2024 to a peak of $4 by April 2025, one of the steepest increases the market has seen in decades, according to Intercontinental Exchange data. Because futures serve as the benchmark for what importers and roasters pay for beans, sharp increases often lead to higher costs, which may eventually show up in retail prices.Tariffs are another factor. In April, the U.S. imposed new tariffs on coffee imports — 10% on key coffee-growing Latin American countries and about 20% for Asian growers, with Brazil hit hardest at 50%. Since then, grocery-store coffee prices have risen about 21%, according to consumer price index data.In mid-November, the White House rolled back most of the new coffee tariffs, eliminating duties for nearly all producing countries except Brazil, which retained a 40% tariff. Last week, the administration removed the remaining 40% duty on Brazilian coffee as well, effectively ending tariffs on coffee imports from almost all major exporters.Because retail prices typically lag wholesale costs, it may take time before any easing shows up on store shelves. Still, removing tariffs should eventually help take some pressure off prices, according to the National Coffee Association, an industry trade group.\"Significant coffee price inflation has occurred during the time tariffs have been in place,\" a spokesperson for NCA tells CNBC Make It. \"Removing tariffs on the world's leading coffee producing countries is expected to significantly decrease costs.\"Black Friday sale: Want to up your AI skills and be more productive? Get 25% off our most popular course of the year, How to Use AI to Be More Successful at Work, with coupon code GETSMART.

    "body": "U.S. President Donald Trump speaks with members of the media following a call with military service members, on Thanksgiving, in Palm Beach, Florida, U.S., Nov. 27, 2025. Anna Rose Layden | ReutersThe White House on Friday evening named the Boston Globe, CBS News and The Independent as \"media offender of the week,\" blasting their coverage of a video released by Democratic lawmakers telling the U.S. military that they can disobey illegal orders.The Boston Globe, CBS News and The Independent did not immediately respond to a request for comment from CNBC.Last week, six Democrats, all with military or national security experience, released a video reminding service members that they have the right to refuse illegal orders. President Donald Trump accused them of \"seditious behavior\" and said that in \"the old days\" that was \"punishable by death.\" The FBI is now seeking to interview Sen. Mark Kelly and the other Democrats featured in the video.The White House has denied that Trump has ever issued illegal orders. However, some experts have said the Pentagon's deadly campaign against alleged drug traffickers in the Caribbean is unlawful. On Friday, the Washington Post reported that Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth verbally ordered to kill all crew members on a suspected drug boat. Rep. Seth Moulton, D-Mass., a Marine Corps veteran, told the newspaper that Americans will eventually be prosecuted for this, \"either as a war crime or outright murder.\"",

    "body": "Bestselling author and wellness leader Deepak Chopra is optimistic about the possibilities of artificial intelligence. \"The thing is, AI is here to stay,\" he says. Chopra believes that while the technology can be harmful, it can also be beneficial when used very specifically for self-discovery. Chopra recommends using AI chatbots to get to know yourself better, suggesting questions like, \"What is my purpose?\" and \"How can I cultivate self-compassion?\"Chopra recently launched an online wellness platform that offers meditations, community discussion boards and live sessions led by Chopra himself. And he's bullish enough on AI to have created his very own Deepak Chopra chatbot. Unlike large language models such as Anthropic's Claude and Google's Gemini, Chopra's bot is what's called a small language model. Instead of training the bot on all of human knowledge, it's trained on Chopra's work, specifically.\"I've written 95 plus books,\" he says. \"I've done innumerable conferences. I have thousands of videos on YouTube and LinkedIn and Facebook and Instagram and TikTok. So I fed all that into my AI.\" Chopra platform subscribers pay $10 monthly, which includes chatbot access. Non-subscribers can pay from 50 cents per 30-minute session to $6 a month to use the bot.The thing is, AI is here to stay.Deepak ChopraAuthor, wellness guruUsers can choose from a series of existing prompts on subjects including success, relationships, sex and spirituality, or they can simply put in their own question. Answers come back in text format and can also be played out loud in Chopra's voice. But Chopra says the bot does have its limits: \"We will not be doing suicide prevention,\" he says. \"That's for professionals.\" Chopra's chatbot will not offer psychotherapy either, he says.Instead, Chopra says you can give the bot prompts like \"I haven't slept in five days, can you give me a meditation?\" or \"I'm having difficulty in my relationship because we're not communicating.\" \"Then, we give you guidelines,\" he says. Ultimately, Chopra says he wants people to cultivate empathy, compassion, joy and peace of mind, and that he wants to be a resource for users around the clock. \"You have me as your companion in your pocket all the time,\" he says.He adds that he wouldn't mind continuing to be a presence in his family's life. \"My grandchildren's grandchildren will be able to have a conversation with me long after I'm gone,\" he says.Black Friday sale: Want to up your AI skills and be more productive? Get 25% off our most popular course of the year, How to Use AI to Be More Successful at Work, with coupon code GETSMART.

    "body": "Being a great leader takes time and practice, and a growing share of workers are trying to get better at it.Search interest in the term \"leadership\" is at an all-time high, according to Google data, along with related terms like training, best practices, advice on how to lead a team and sources for professional development.The buzz likely stems from people wanting to lead during a time of rapid business changes due to remote and hybrid policies in offices, global politics, changing economic circumstances and the adoption of technology like AI, says Brian Glaser, Google's chief learning officer.Glaser has been a manager off and on for the last 20 years and leads the onboarding, training and leadership development for some 150,000 employees worldwide. As a leadership expert, Glaser tells CNBC Make It that people of all experience levels struggle with one main aspect of being a boss: delivering \"really effective feedback so that people are clear about where they stand.\"Instead, many managers shy away from critical or constructive feedback in the pursuit of being well liked.\"As a leader, being nice is great,\" Glaser says. That can lead you to be liked among your reports, but \"the name of the game is really to be respected.\"\"If you're not delivering the feedback, you may not get the kind of respect you need as a manager,\" he says. This can be tough for first-time managers or someone who's been promoted and is now overseeing the work of former peers.But teams can grow stagnant or repeat avoidable mistakes \"if you're only looking to tell people what's working and not necessarily delivering the hard stuff,\" Glaser says.Glaser's team is behind Google's latest People Management Essentials, a paid course available to the public that covers lessons from over a dozen Google bosses about what it takes to be an excellent leader.Some of the lessons about delivering solid feedback are inspired by sports psychology, Glaser says.\"We know the best athletes are the folks who receive constant feedback from their coaches about how they're performing, he says. Win or lose, \"every time they finish a game, they debrief, they talk about what worked and what didn't. We believe those same concepts can be applied to organizational life.\"Talking about areas for improvements helps ensure stronger performance outcomes in the future. Athletes including Super Bowl champ Tom Brady and Team USA Olympic gymnast Gabby Douglas have discussed that learning from mistakes and failures fueled their successes.In the workplace, meanwhile, telling a report that \"they need to improve can be challenging,\" Glaser says, \"but we know through good practice, managers can do this, and it really matters.\"Black Friday sale: Want to up your AI skills and be more productive? Get 25% off our most popular course of the year, How to Use AI to Be More Successful at Work, with coupon code GETSMART.

    "body": "The Jefferies Financial Group Inc. headquarters in New York, US, on Monday, Oct. 20, 2025. Michael Nagle | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesThe U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating Jefferies' relationship into bankrupt auto parts maker First Brands Group, The Financial Times reported Thursday. The newspaper, citing people with knowledge of the matter, said the regulator is looking into whether Jefferies gave investors enough information on its Point Bonita fund's exposure to the failed auto business. The inquiry into internal controls and potential conflicts within the bank is at an early stage, the report said. It's not clear whether it will result in any allegations of wrongdoing. Jefferies came under pressure last month after its exposure to First Brands — which collapsed under a series of complex debt agreements — raised fears of other bad loans on Wall Street.

Alexander Kazakov | Afp | Getty ImagesRussian President Vladimir Putin has broken his silence on a U.S.-backed peace plan to end the war in Ukraine, saying Moscow is ready for \"serious\" discussions about the draft proposals.Putin said Thursday that the outlines of a fledgling peace plan that has been reached by the U.S. and Ukraine could be the basis of a deal that ends the almost four-year long conflict.\"In general, we agree that this can be the basis for future agreements,\" Putin said in comments made during a trip to Kyrgyzstan and translated by Reuters.The president added that the U.S. appeared to be taking Russia's position on a peace settlement \"into account\" and that Moscow was ready for \"serious discussions\" when U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff travels to Moscow next week for talks.It's the first time Putin has publicly addressed a peace plan since a flurry of diplomacy between the U.S. and Ukraine in the last few days. Those talks came after reports last week of a U.S.-Russia devised 28-point peace plan, which appeared to heavily favor Russia's demands.  Ukraine and its European allies' scrambled to mount a response, amending the plan and inserting counter proposals which were discussed in Geneva last weekend with a U.S. delegation led by U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio. All eyes on RussiaThe current draft plan, which has reportedly been slimmed down to 19 key proposals, appears to have received Ukraine's tentative backing, putting the ball back in Russia's court as to whether it could accept the framework and build upon it.On Wednesday, Putin's close aide Yuri Ushakov had claimed that Russia had not even seen an official version of the latest U.S.-backed draft deal for Ukraine, but that it had seen an unofficial version.Regarding the plan it had seen, Ushakov said the Kremlin viewed some aspects of the plan positively while \"several of its points require serious analysis.\"Sergei Ryabkov, Russia's deputy foreign minister, said Moscow welcomed U.S. efforts on peace proposals but said \"there are no concessions on key issues on the Ukraine settlement,\" suggesting there could be some distance to travel before a deal is actually reached. Putin's Press Secretary Dmitry Peskov warned on Wednesday against jumping to conclusions regarding an end to the war, which Russia launched when it invaded Ukraine in Feb. 2022.\"Wait. It's too early to say that,\" Peskov told reporters, state news agency TASS reported, when asked whether this was the closest Russia and Ukraine had ever been to concluding a peace agreement. Putin on Thursday praised Russian advances in Ukraine and told reporters that the fighting in Ukraine would stop only when Ukrainian troops withdraw from their positions in key areas. If they did not do so, then Russian forces would achieve their objectives by force, he added, appearing to suggest that Moscow was not willing to give up one of its key objectives in the war (and contained within the initial peace plan secretly drafted with the U.S.) which was to have full control of Ukraine's eastern Donbas region.CNBC has contacted the Kremlin for further comment and is awaiting a response.Ukraine on board, tentativelyMultiple outlets reported Tuesday that a Ukrainian delegation that had held talks with U.S. officials in Abu Dhabi on Tuesday appeared to tentatively support the basis of a U.S.-backed peace plan — though key details remained unresolved.ABC News and CBS News both reported an unnamed U.S. official had said that the Ukrainians \"have agreed\" to the deal, while adding there were still points that had to be ironed out. It was unclear if both stories quoted the same U.S. official.Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said later Tuesday that Kyiv was ready to advance the peace framework, Reuters reported, citing a copy of a speech the president gave to a coalition of allied countries.U.S. President Donald Trump said at the White House on Tuesday, \"I think we're getting very close to a deal. We'll find out ... I think we're making progress.\"In a Truth Social post later Tuesday afternoon, Trump said, \"there are only a few remaining points of disagreement.\"",

    "body": "With the rising cost of groceries, rent and other essentials, having money to set aside and save can feel impossible. However, saving doesn't always require more money — you might just need to reorganize what you already have, says Kashif Ahmed, a certified financial planner and lecturer at Suffolk University in Boston. Ahmed, who teaches a finance class to undergraduate students, says many of his students tell him they want to save more, but say they lack the funds to start. That tracks with national data: Nearly 75% of Gen Z adults reported having $1,000 or less saved, according to a Self Financial survey of over 2,000 adults in July. But often, \"the money is there, you just have to go look for it,\" Ahmed says. Here's where he recommends starting.How to reorganize your spendingAhmed's advice: Start by writing down every dollar you spend and sincerely looking at it.When looking through your list, ask yourself which expenses were absolutely necessary and which expenses were simply \"wants.\" For example, he says, do you really need two lattes a day or five different streaming services? Sometimes, it may be smart to bring in a third-party auditor — someone like a parent or friend who isn't emotionally invested in your purchases — who can identify places to cut spending and save instead. Even packing a meal instead of buying lunch once a week can be a great way to get started, Ahmed says. \"Financial security is absolutely possible,\" he says. \"It's all about discipline.\"It's OK to make fun purchasesSaving money doesn't necessarily mean you have to cut out all purchases that may bring joy or stick to a tight budget limited to essential items.Sometimes, a restrictive budget may even backfire on you, leading to periods of spending binges, Suze Orman, personal finance expert and host of the podcast \"Women & Money (and Everyone Smart Enough to Listen),\" told the Wall Street Journal in 2024.Instead, Orman said to try focusing on smaller, everyday decisions that can make you feel more in control of your spending. \"Just do one thing that might make you feel more secure,\" Orman said. \"Is that saving $10? Is that not going out to eat?\"Black Friday sale: Want to up your AI skills and be more productive? Get 25% off our most popular course of the year, How to Use AI to Be More Successful at Work, with coupon code GETSMART.

Its 300 wealthiest residents are worth a combined 850 billion Swiss Francs, or just over $1 trillion, according to business magazine Bilanz. But on Sunday, voters will go to the polls to vote on an inheritance tax that has riled them up. The proposal to tax every inheritance and gift of more than 50 million Swiss Francs at 50% is likely to be defeated. A recent poll put support at just 30%.watch nowBut close followers of the debate told CNBC the initiative has shaken wealthy individuals and family-owned companies since it was proposed in 2024. Swiss billionaire Peter Spuhler, founder and owner of Stadler Rail, has threatened to leave the country if the tax becomes law. He told told Swiss daily Tagesanzeiger that his family would struggle to pay such a tax as their wealth is tied up in companies.\"A lot of people who would be affected talked to their consultants and their tax lawyers, and they did the paperwork to be sure that this time of the year, a week before the final vote, they are ready to move out if necessary,\" Stefan Legge from the University of St. Gallen in Switzerland told CNBC on Friday.'The ultra wealthy are like queens on a chessboard'Legge, who conducted research into the potential impact of the tax, said: \"If you target the super wealthy, they are like queens on a chessboard.\" \"They are very mobile.

Anadolu | Anadolu | Getty ImagesSouth Korea became the latest country to impose sanctions on Prince Group, a multinational network accused of running large-scale fraud operations across Southeast Asia. Seoul's move follows similar actions by the U.S., UK, and Singapore.In a statement Thursday, South Korea's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that the measures mark the country's first independent sanctions regarding transnational crime and the \"largest single sanction measure in history,\" according to a Google translation.\"It shows the government's firm determination to actively respond to online organized crime in Southeast Asia that is causing serious damage at home and abroad,\" the statement added. Prince Group is accused of operating large-scale online 'scam centers' in Cambodia and Myanmar that used trafficked workers to defraud victims around the world. South Korean sanctions target 15 people and 132 entities linked to the network.The documents detailed the completion of two particular facilities staffed with 1,250 mobile\nphones that controlled 76,000 accounts on a popular social media platform.Source: US Eastern District of New YorkSouth Korea and Cambodia agreed in October to set up a joint task force to help tackle online crimes, after a university student died of torture in August in a scam compound.Prince Group has denied any wrongdoing. In a Nov. 11 statement issued through U.S. law firm Boies Schiller Flexner, the group called the allegations \"baseless.\"\"The recent allegations are baseless and appear aimed at justifying the unlawful seizure of assets worth billions of dollars,\" the Cambodia-based network said, adding that it had engaged a team of lawyers from the U.S. legal powerhouse.CNBC has reached out to Prince Group and Boies Schiller Flexner for comment and didn't immediately hear back.Crackdown widensThe latest action against Prince Group builds on broader international efforts to curb scam networks in the region. On Oct. 14, the U.S. and UK announced sweeping sanctions on Prince Group, which the U.S. Treasury Department designated as a \"Transnational Criminal Organization.\"The U.S. Department of Justice also seized about $15 billion worth of bitcoin on Oct. 14, held in cryptocurrency wallets owned by Cambodian national Chen Zhi, the chairman of Prince Group. Zhi, a 38-year-old Chinese-born emigre who is also known as \"Vincent,\" was also charged with wire fraud conspiracy and money laundering conspiracy and remains at large.Chart of The Prince Group Transnational Criminal OrganizationU.S. Treasury DepartmentAnother Cambodian financial network, Huione Group, was also banned from the U.S. financial system on the same day, which the U.S. Treasury Department accused in May of colluding with North Korean cybercriminals.\"Huione Group serves as a critical node for laundering proceeds of cyber heists carried out by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK), and for [Transnational Criminal Organizations] in Southeast Asia perpetrating virtual currency investment scams, commonly known as \"pig butchering\" scams, among others,\" the U.S. Treasury Department said.Seoul's sanctions announced Thursday also target the Huione Group. The British government said the centers in Southeast Asia used fake job adverts to lure workers, who were then forced to commit online fraud, including love scams and crypto scams, under threat of torture.In October, Singapore had seized over 150 million Singapore dollars of assets linked to the group. The Singapore Police Force said these included bank accounts, securities accounts and cash.",

Sergio Yate | Afp | Getty ImagesAmerican Airlines said Saturday that aircrafts impacted by an Airbus recall have received the software fixes necessary to resume flying.\"As of 12 p.m. CT, no aircraft were left to be updated of the 209 impacted,\" the company said. \"American expects no further operational impact related to the Emergency Airworthiness Directive and looks forward to the remaining days of the Thanksgiving holiday travel period, especially Sunday, our most-traveled day.\"Thousands of travelers worldwide were stranded after Airbus ordered immediate software fixes for 6,000 A320-series aircraft, a move that affected more than half of the narrow-body fleet and forced airlines to ground jets during one of the busiest travel weekends of the year.The directive — among the largest in the 55-year history of Airbus — quickly spilled into U.S. holiday travel and stretched to Australia. The disruption, linked to solar flares, hit especially hard in Asia, where the single-aisle A320 family anchors short-haul networks.United Airlines said six aircraft in its fleet were affected, and the carrier expected \"minor disruption to a few flights.\"  Delta Air Lines said less than 50 of its Airbus A320 fleet were affected.Japan's ANA Holdings canceled 95 domestic flights Saturday, affecting around 13,200 passengers. The carrier, along with affiliates such as Peach Aviation, operates the country's largest Airbus narrow-body fleet, while rival Japan Airlines relies mostly on Boeing aircraft.watch nowAir India, which is partially owned by Singapore Airlines, said it had completed software updates on over 40% of its affected aircraft and that there were no flight cancellations, although some flights were delayed or rescheduled.Scoot, another carrier under the Singapore Airlines group, said 21 of its 29 A320s required the fix and that it aimed to complete the work by Saturday.In Australia, Jetstar Airways canceled around 90 flights after identifying 34 aircraft that required the software correction. \"As of 3:30 pm [local time], 20 of the 34 affected aircraft are ready to return to service. We're expecting the remaining to be ready overnight, allowing flights to resume as planned on Sunday 30 November,\" a Jetstar spokesperson told CNBC.The budget airline and its parent company, Qantas, which is Australia's national flag carrier, together hold about 65% of the domestic market. Rival Virgin Australia, which has four A320s in its fleet and a 35% share, said that it was unaffected by the recall.The European Union Aviation Safety Agency said in a directive on Friday that a JetBlue flight on Oct. 30 experienced an \"uncommanded and limited pitch down event.\"  The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration also issued an emergency directive later that day, ordering operators of the affected model to address the glitch.Airbus CEO Guillaume Faury said in a LinkedIn post: \"The fix required on some #A320 aircraft has been causing significant logistical challenges and delays since yesterday. ... Our teams are working around the clock to support our operators and ensure these updates are deployed as swiftly as possible to get planes back in the sky and resume normal operations.\"",

    "body": "Shoppers and pedestrians move through the Pitt Street Mall during a Black Friday sale on Nov. 28, 2025 in Sydney, Australia.Lisa Maree Williams | Getty ImagesThe emergence of AI shopping doesn't just give consumers access to personalized advice and hassle-free shopping, it also brings with it an increased risk of digital fraud.This Black Friday, for the first time, consumers and retailers alike are being warned about the perils of so-called \"agentic shopping,\" as consumers turn to large language models to search for products, compare offerings, receive personalized recommendations, and even make purchases without much human input. These technological advances come with their own risks.  \"It definitely makes my life easier… but at the same time, it also makes fraudsters' life substantially easier as well,\" said Michael Reitblat, CEO of Forter, an identity intelligence company that works on fraud prevention.According to Reitblat, there has been a 200% increase in agentic shopping by consumers over the past six months. That has been accompanied by a nearly tenfold increase in fraudsters using AI. \"Think of it as sending thousands of robots into different stores to masquerade as good consumers,\" Reitblat told CNBC's \"Squawk Box Europe.\"watch nowWhile some retailers' knee-jerk reaction has been to simply ban AI purchases, that could be a faulty strategy as more and more consumers use AI for shopping and that is driving good quality traffic, Reitblat said.A report by McKinsey & Company and The Business of Fashion found that among fashion executives, AI and digital tools were seen as the single biggest opportunity for the industry in 2026. To ensure products are visible and favored by AI models, brands must rethink marketing and e-commerce strategies, the report noted, adding that semantically rich data and API-accessible content will be critical to success.\"You need to use AI to fight AI,\" Reitblat said. \"You need to make sure that you're leveraging better data than fraudsters may have, and you need to properly think of: how do you authenticate the consumers?\"Shaky consumer confidenceValue-conscious consumers is another factor retailers have to deal with this year as heightened trade tensions and worries about a slowing economy impact consumers' spending habits.Consumer confidence has been shaky heading into the shopping season. In Europe, economic sentiment has remained stubbornly below its long-term average since mid-2022, according to data by the European Commission. Meanwhile in the U.S., consumer confidence hit its lowest point since April in November as concerns about job security mount.watch nowSome experts have suggested a split between wealthy consumers doing well and others that are cutting back on spending amid pressure from higher prices, in what has been dubbed the \"K-shaped economy.\"\"Consumer confidence has been bumpy, and therefore the customers feeling like they're getting genuine value is going to be a big thing for this year,\" said Curry's Chief Services Officer Dean Kramer. \"We know research is a big part of how consumers approach Black Friday, making sure they're getting absolute value.\"",

    "body": "This photograph shows a general view of Nexperia headquarters in Nijmegen on November 6, 2025.John Thys | Afp | Getty Images Dutch chipmaker Nexperia has publicly called on its China unit to help restore supply chain operations, warning in an open letter that customers across industries are reporting \"imminent production outages.\"Nexperia's Dutch unit said Thursday that its open letter followed \"repeated attempts to establish direct communication through conventional channels\" but did not have \"any meaningful response.\"The letter marks the latest twist in a long-running saga that has threatened global automotive supply chains and stoked a bitter battle between Amsterdam and Beijing over technology transfer. \"We welcomed the Chinese authorities' commitment to facilitate the resumption of exports from Nexperia's Chinese facility and that of our subcontractors, enabling the continued flow of our products to global markets,\" Nexperia's Dutch unit said in the letter.\"Nevertheless, customers across industries are still reporting imminent production stoppages. This situation cannot persist,\" they added. The group called on the leadership of Nexperia's entities in China to take steps to restore the  established supply flows without delay.In a statement, Wingtech Technology, Nexperia's Chinese parent company, said on Friday that the Dutch unit's open letter contained \"a large number of misleading and untrue allegations.\"It said the \"unlawful deprivation of Wingtech's control and shareholder rights over Nexperia\" was the root cause of the ongoing supply chain chaos.\"Combined with the recent series of actions by the Dutch government and Nexperia B.V., we believe their true intention is to buy time for Nexperia B.V. to construct a 'de-China-ized' supply chain and permanently strip Wingtech of its shareholder rights,\" Wingtech said.In this photo illustration, the logo of semiconductor manufacturer Nexperia is displayed on a screen.Vcg | Visual China Group | Getty ImagesNexperia manufactures billions of so-called foundation chips — transistors, diodes and power management components — that are produced in Europe, assembled and tested in China, and then re-exported to customers in Europe and elsewhere. The chips are relatively low-tech and inexpensive but are needed in almost every device that uses electricity. In cars, those chips are used to connect the battery to motors, for lights and sensors, for braking systems, airbag controllers, entertainment systems and electric windows. How did we get here? The situation began in September, when the Dutch government invoked a Cold War-era law to effectively take control of Nexperia. The highly unusual move was reportedly made after the U.S. raised security concerns. Beijing responded by moving to block its products from leaving China, which, in turn, raised the alarm among global automakers as they faced shortages of the chipmaker's components. In an apparent reprieve last week, however, the Dutch government said it had suspended its state intervention at Nexperia following talks with Chinese authorities. It was thought at the time that this could bring an end to the dispute and pave the way for a restoration of normal supply chains.  Rico Luman, senior sector economist for transport and logistics at Dutch bank ING, said it remains unclear how long the situation will last.\"The imposed measures to seize the Dutch Nexperia subsidiary have been lifted, but there are still talks ongoing about restoring the corporate structure and relation with parent company Wingtech,\" Luman told CNBC by email.\"It's not only about supplies of finished chips, it's also about wafer supplies from Europe to the Chinese entity,\" Luman said, adding that companies including Japan's Nissan and German auto supplier Bosch are among the firms to have warned about looming shortages.Nissan signage at a dealership in Richmond, California, US, on Friday, June 21, 2024.Bloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesA spokesperson for the German Association of the Automotive Industry (VDA), which represents Volkswagen, Mercedes-Benz Group and BMW among hundreds of others, warned of elevated risks to supply, \"particularly for the first quarter\" of 2026.\"In recent weeks, the German automotive industry has largely been able to keep production stable through intensive efforts,\" a VDA spokesperson told CNBC by email. \"However, the disruptions in the supply chain for Nexperia parts caused by political intervention have not been fundamentally resolved. Component availability remains uncertain,\" they added. ING's Luman said the Nexperia situation is somewhat comparable to China's rare earth export controls.\"The Chinese position appears strong again as European manufacturers are dependent on the supplies. And comparable to the rare earths, it's not fully transparent which buyer is able to qualify for which chip supplies,\" Luman said. — CNBC's Annika Kim Constantino contributed to this report.",

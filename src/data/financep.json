His comments come shortly after Nielsen joined protesters in Nuuk, Greenland's capital, over the weekend, where people marched to demonstrate against Trump's push to take control of the self-governing Danish territory.On Saturday, the U.S. president threatened to impose a rising wave of tariffs against eight European countries for their opposition to his campaign.European political leaders called the proposed tariffs \"unacceptable\" and vowed to stand behind Denmark, which is responsible for the island's foreign, defense, and security policies.In a social media post, Greenland's Nielsen said the recent demonstrations in Greenland and in Denmark had shown \"a strong and dignified unity.\"He also welcomed support from other European leaders, saying it shows a \"clear recognition\" that Greenland had the right to make its own decisions.\"The latest statements from the US, including threats of tariffs, do not change that line. We will not be pressured. We stand firm on dialogue, on respect and on international law,\" Nielsen said in a Facebook post, according to a Google translation.",

    "body": "People bear Greenlandic flags as they gather in front of the U.S. consulate  protest against U.S. President Donald Trump and his announced intent to acquire Greenland on January 17, 2026 in Nuuk, Greenland. Sean Gallup | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesEuropean leaders have hit back at U.S. President Donald Trump's threat to impose fresh tariffs on them if they oppose his attempt to buy Greenland, describing the ultimatum as \"completely wrong\" and \"unacceptable.\"Trump announced on Saturday that eight European allies would face increasing tariffs, starting at 10% on Feb.1 and rising to 25% on June 1, if a deal is not reached so Washington can \"buy\" the Arctic territory, which is semi-autonomous and part of the Kingdom of Denmark.Eight NATO members' goods sent to the U.S. will face escalating tariffs \"until such time as a Deal is reached for the Complete and Total purchase of Greenland,\" Trump stated on his social media platform Truth Social on Saturday.The proposed tariffs would target Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, the U.K, the Netherlands and Finland, Trump said.European leaders were quick to react to the latest threat with U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer commenting Saturday that \"applying tariffs on allies for pursuing the collective security of NATO allies is completely wrong,\" while French President Emmanuel Macron described them as \"unacceptable.\"\"Europeans will respond in a united and coordinated manner should they be confirmed. We will ensure that European sovereignty is upheld,\" Macron stated on social media platform X on Saturday.Reuters quoted a source close to Macron as saying he was pushing for the activation of the Anti-Coercion Instrument, which could limit access to public tenders in the EU or restrict trade in services in which the U.S. has a surplus with the bloc.European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and President of the European Council Antonio Costa issued a statement Saturday in which they said the EU \"stands in full solidarity with Denmark and the people of Greenland.\" It added that it was committed to further dialogue following talks between Denmark, Greenland and top U.S. officials last week, which ended without a diplomatic breakthrough. Nonetheless, Danish Foreign Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen said Trump's tariffs threat had come \"as a surprise\" following the \"constructive meeting\" with U.S. Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio. The European Union has called an emergency meeting which will take place at 16:00 p.m. London time on Sunday, Reuters reported.Finnish President Alexander Stubb, who, like British PM Keir Starmer is known to have a good relationship with Donald Trump, called for cool heads and further talks.He warned further tariffs — which would come on top of the 15% tariff on EU exports to the U.S., and the 10% levied on U.K. exports -- would be damaging, however.\"Among allies, issues are best resolved through discussion, not through pressure,\" he said on X. \"European countries stand united. We emphasize the principles of territorial integrity and sovereignty. We support Denmark and Greenland. Dialogue with the United States continues. Tariffs would undermine the transatlantic relationship and risk a dangerous downward spiral.\"'A moderately significant economic problem'Trump's demands now threaten the EU-U.S. trade agreement struck in August.Manfred Weber, a senior member of the European Parliament (MEP), said the EU trade deal with the U.S. is \"not possible at this stage.\"Holger Schmieding, chief economist at Berenberg Bank said: \"Trump wants to force Denmark and its European backers to sell Greenland to the U.S. by imposing tariffs. For Europe, this is a bad geopolitical headache and a moderately significant economic problem.\"He estimated that an additional 10% levy on goods from affected countries could raise U.S. consumer prices by up to 0.15%. But \"in the unlikely case\" that the EU-U.S. trade deal is not implemented, \"the damage to US consumers could then be almost three times as bad in the end,\" Schmieding told CNBC in a note.Denmark and its European neighbors have made repeated efforts to dissuade Trump from looking to acquire Greenland, particularly after the president said earlier this month that he would consider all options to obtain the mineral-rich island, including using military force.Trump says acquiring Greenland is critical for U.S. national security. He has also said that U.S. ownership would prevent Russia and China from gaining a foothold in the territory. Beijing and Moscow have lambasted Trump's claims and his coveting of Greenland, calling them a \"pretext ...for selfish gains\" and \"extraordinary.\" Young people with placards reading \"Greenland is not for sale!\" take part in a demonstration that gathered almost a third of the city population to protest against the US President's plans to take Greenland, on January 17, 2026 in Nuuk, Greenland, near the US Consulate to Greenland. Alessandro Rampazzo | Afp | Getty ImagesGreenland itself has repeatedly rejected Trump's advances and while a majority of its population would like independence from Denmark, according to opinion polls, most Greenlanders would not like to become a part of the U.S., either.Protests were held in Nuuk, the capital of Greenland, on Saturday, with demonstrators holding placards reiterating the position of the island's leadership, and that of Denmark, that \"Greenland is not for sale.\"— Spriha Srivastava contributed to this report.",

    "body": "Courtesy of Disney Enterprises Inc.Blue aliens, a family of superheroes and a city of talking animals boosted the Walt Disney Company to the top of the domestic box office in 2025.Full-year ticket sales in the United States and Canada rose about 4% from 2024 to $9.05 billion. Disney accounted for the highest share of that haul with $2.49 billion in ticket sales, or 27.5%, according to data from Comscore.It's closest competitors were Warner Bros. Discovery, which tallied $1.9 billion domestically, or 21%, and Universal, which took in $1.7 billion, or 19.7%. Together, these three studios accounted for nearly 70% of the domestic box office market share.No other studio surpassed $1 billion in domestic ticket sales or accounted for more than 7% of the total box office haul.\"[Warner Bros., Disney and Universal] have the advantage of having at least two or more distinct and successful sub-brands labels — such as Marvel under Disney, New Line under WB and Illumination under Universal  — under their corporate umbrella that enables these studios to dominate at least in terms of the overall box office and percentage of the marketplace that they control,\" said Paul Dergarabedian, head of marketplace trends at Comscore.Disney's standout performance came on the backs of already popular intellectual property. Four of its films were part of the top 10 highest-grossing domestic releases of the year, including the live-action remake of \"Lilo & Stitch,\" a sequel to 2016's \"Zootopia,\" another entrant in the Marvel Cinematic Universe with \"Fantastic Four: First Steps\" and a third \"Avatar\" film.\"Most years at the box office are dominated by known IP and non-original content; films that have the baked in brand name recognition that theoretically gives those films a leg up in terms of marketing and potential box office success,\" Dergarabedian said.In fact, nine of the 10 biggest movies at the domestic box offices were from existing IP. Warner Bros.' \"Sinners\" was the only original title to make the list.\"In 2025 there were some big budget originals that did incredibly well ... but lest anyone think that trend is going away, 2026 looks to eclipse 2025 in terms of the number of high-profile sequels and known IP on the slate for the year,\" Dergarabedian said. That's especially true for Disney.The studio is set to release its first Star Wars film in theaters since 2019 called \"The Mandalorian and Grogu\" after the popular characters of its \"The Mandalorian\" series on Disney+; \"Toy Story 5\" is will hit theaters in June followed by a live-action \"Moana\" in July; then the hotly anticipated \"Avengers: Doomsday\" arrives in December.A new Spider-Man film will also sling into theaters in 2026, but as part of a deal with Sony to have the character as part of Disney's MCU, Sony keeps the majority of box office profits while Disney gets merchandise sales.The box office will also get a boost from Warner Bros.' \"Supergirl\" and \"Dune: Part Three,\" Universal's \"Minions 3,\" \"The Super Mario Galaxy Movie\" and \"The Odyssey,\" Lionsgate's \"Hunger Games: Sunrise on the Reaping\" and Sony's third \"Jumanji\" film. \"As we look into 2026, there's plenty of optimism to go around,\" said Shawn Robbins, director of analytics at Fandango and founder of Box Office Theory \"The slate is packed with top-tier franchises, some fan-driven and others family-oriented, alongside filmmaker-driven tentpoles ... plus an inevitable crop of strong or potentially surprising performers out of horror, comedy, indie, and other genres.\"Disclosure: Versant is the parent company of CNBC and Fandango.",

    "body": "Everyday living costs play a major role in how much money you need to retire.A new state-by-state analysis from personal finance website GOBankingRates shows that the estimated total savings needed to retire at 65 can differ by as much as $1.46 million depending on where you live.In Hawaii, retirees need about $2.2 million to stop working at 65 and cover essential living expenses for 25 years, including housing, groceries, transportation, utilities and health-care costs. That is the highest estimated minimum of any state. By comparison, Oklahoma has the lowest estimated total, at $735,284, to cover the same basic costs.The analysis is based on the average living costs for retirees 65 or older in each state, drawn from the latest data published by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. From there, GOBankingRates subtracted average Social Security payments and estimated the savings needed to cover the remaining expenses using an annual 4% withdrawal rate. The resulting figures represent a baseline for covering essential costs and don't factor in discretionary spending such as travel, dining or entertainment. Additionally, the estimates don't account for factors such as inflation, lifestyle changes or unexpected costs.Housing is the biggest factor in annual retirement costs, as it varies by roughly $30,000 annually between states. Utilities and health-care costs can range by as much as $5,000 annually, the study finds.Here's a look the minimum amount of savings needed to retire at 65 in each state, in alphabetical order.AlabamaAnnual cost of living: $53,999Savings you need to retire: $789,037AlaskaAnnual cost of living: $78,449Savings you need to retire: $1,400,286ArizonaAnnual cost of living: $66,838Savings you need to retire: $1,110,019ArkansasAnnual cost of living: $54,859Savings you need to retire: $810,538CaliforniaAnnual cost of living: $83,978Savings you need to retire: $1,538,508ColoradoAnnual cost of living: $63,091Savings you need to retire: $1,016,336ConnecticutAnnual cost of living: $70,094Savings you need to retire: $1,191,417DelawareAnnual cost of living: $63,152Savings you need to retire: $1,017,871FloridaAnnual cost of living: $61,125Savings you need to retire: $967,190GeorgiaAnnual cost of living: $56,395Savings you need to retire: $848,933HawaiiAnnual cost of living: $110,393Savings you need to retire: $2,198,902IdahoAnnual cost of living: $60,818Savings you need to retire: $959,511IllinoisAnnual cost of living: $58,913Savings you need to retire: $911,901IndianaAnnual cost of living: $55,657Savings you need to retire: $830,504IowaAnnual cost of living: $55,473Savings you need to retire: $825,896KansasAnnual cost of living: $54,613Savings you need to retire: $804,395KentuckyAnnual cost of living: $56,456Savings you need to retire: $850,469LouisianaAnnual cost of living: $56,947Savings you need to retire: $862,756MaineAnnual cost of living: $70,155Savings you need to retire: $1,192,953MarylandAnnual cost of living: $73,043Savings you need to retire: $1,265,135MassachusettsAnnual cost of living: $92,639Savings you need to retire: $1,755,055MichiganAnnual cost of living: $58,176Savings you need to retire: $893,472MinnesotaAnnual cost of living: $57,869Savings you need to retire: $885,793MississippiAnnual cost of living: $52,524Savings you need to retire: $752,178MissouriAnnual cost of living: $54,674Savings you need to retire: $805,931MontanaAnnual cost of living: $67,452Savings you need to retire: $1,125,377NebraskaAnnual cost of living: $56,272Savings you need to retire: $845,862NevadaAnnual cost of living: $60,572Savings you need to retire: $953,368New HampshireAnnual cost of living: $67,084Savings you need to retire: $1,116,163New JerseyAnnual cost of living: $70,401Savings you need to retire: $1,199,096New MexicoAnnual cost of living: $56,825Savings you need to retire: $859,684New YorkAnnual cost of living: $77,773Savings you need to retire: $1,383,392North CarolinaAnnual cost of living: $59,835Savings you need to retire: $934,938North DakotaAnnual cost of living: $56,087Savings you need to retire: $841,254OhioAnnual cost of living: $57,009Savings you need to retire: $864,291OklahomaAnnual cost of living: $51,849Savings you need to retire: $735,284OregonAnnual cost of living: $68,681Savings you need to retire: $1,156,093PennsylvaniaAnnual cost of living: $59,650Savings you need to retire: $930,331Rhode IslandAnnual cost of living: $69,664Savings you need to retire: $1,180,666South CarolinaAnnual cost of living: $56,825Savings you need to retire: $859,684South DakotaAnnual cost of living: $56,395Savings you need to retire: $848,933TennesseeAnnual cost of living: $55,473Savings you need to retire: $825,896TexasAnnual cost of living: $55,780Savings you need to retire: $833,575UtahAnnual cost of living: $60,879Savings you need to retire: $961,047VermontAnnual cost of living: $69,848Savings you need to retire: $1,185,274VirginiaAnnual cost of living: $61,493Savings you need to retire: $976,405WashingtonAnnual cost of living: $69,971Savings you need to retire: $1,188,345West VirginiaAnnual cost of living: $54,122Savings you need to retire: $792,109WisconsinAnnual cost of living: $60,019Savings you need to retire: $939,546WyomingAnnual cost of living: $58,545Savings you need to retire: $902,686Want to get ahead at work with AI?

    "body": "Jamie Dimon, Chairman and CEO, JPMorganChase, speaks during the Reagan National Defense Forum at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley, California, U.S. December 6, 2025.  Jonathan Alcorn | ReutersPresident Donald Trump on Saturday threatened to sue JPMorgan Chase over allegedly \"debanking\" him following the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol. \"I'll be suing JPMorgan Chase over the next two weeks for incorrectly and inappropriately DEBANKING me after the January 6th Protest, a protest that turned out to be correct for those doing the protesting,\" Trump said in a social media post. \"The Election was RIGGED!\"\"While we won't get specific about a client, we don't close accounts because of political beliefs,\" said JPMorgan spokesperson Trish Wexler. \"We appreciate that this Administration has moved to address political debanking and we support those efforts.\"In August, Trump signed an executive order requiring banks to ensure they are not refusing financial services to clients based on religious or political beliefs, a practice known as \"debanking.\" Trump claimed without evidence in an August CNBC interview that he was personally discriminated against by banks. He said JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America refused to take his deposits following his first term in office. At the time, JPMorgan said it does not close accounts for political reasons, while Bank of America said it doesn't comment on client matters. BofA also said it would welcome clearer rules from regulators on how to conduct its activities.Trump and his family have a history of railing against financial institutions for allegedly refusing to work with them on the basis of their political orientation. Last year, Donald Trump Jr. said his family had difficulty accessing big bank services — a situation that allegedly prompted the Trumps to enter the cryptocurrency industry. \"So, [my family] got into crypto, not because it was like, 'hey, this is the next cool thing,' we got into it out of necessity,\" Trump Jr. told CNBC in an interview last June.JPMorgan shares are down about 5% over the past week, even after the bank on Tuesday topped expectations for its fourth-quarter earnings and revenue. The shares, and others in the banking sector, fell in response to Trump's demand to cap credit card rates at 10%, giving financial firms until Jan. 20 to comply.Trump's legal threat against JPMorgan comes as the president, in the same Truth Social post, denied a Journal report on Wednesday that said the president had offered JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon the position of Federal Reserve chairman months ago during a meeting at the White House. Dimon took the proposition as a joke, according to the Journal report.In his post, Trump denied the report, underscoring his reservations about Dimon and JPMorgan. \"This statement is totally untrue, there was never such an offer,\" he wrote. \"Why wouldn't The Wall Street Journal call me to ask whether or not such an offer was made? I would have very quickly told them, \"NO,\" and that would have been the end of the story.\"JPMorgan's Wexler said the \"offer\" reported by the Journal was a miscommunication. \"I should have been more vigilant in correcting that word while attempting to dispute the WSJ's anonymous sources,\" she said.The Journal did not immediately respond to a request for comment sent outside of normal business hours. Current Fed Chairman Jerome Powell's term ends on May 15.",

South Korea is scheduled to announce its gross domestic product (GDP) figures on April 24. Photographer: SeongJoon Cho/Bloomberg via Getty ImagesBloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesFancy some cheese-flavored spicy noodles? Judging by export sales, the rest of the world can't get enough of South Korea's food exports, also known as \"K-Food.\"Exports of \"K-Food+\" — a category that includes food products and agricultural industries — surged to a record $13.62 billion in 2025, according to the Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs. That's a 5.1% increase from a year earlier and marked the tenth consecutive year of growth.Instant noodles, or ramyeon, were the standout. Exports jumped nearly 22% to $1.52 billion, making it the first single food category to surpass $1 billion in overseas sales.Cheese-flavored spicy noodles and other new products resonated with consumers in China, the U.S., and emerging markets in Central Asia and the Middle East.\"Global demand for Korean noodles continues to expand, and companies have scaled up production and stabilized supply chains to meet it,\" the ministry noted in a late‑2025 report.Other categories also gained traction overseas, with Korean sauces benefiting from the demand for spicy and sweet flavors, while ice cream and fruit exports rose too.Riding K-pop's coattailsWhat makes the humble pack of South Korean instant noodles so popular? Analysts say culture plays a big role.The massive appeal of K-pop and Korean television dramas has helped fuel demand, with food frequently featured on screen. Characters are often shown eating ramyeon in dramas, variety shows and advertisements.Just as K-pop companies are looking overseas for growth, Korean food makers, especially those selling ramyeon, are doing the same, said Oh Jiwoo, analyst at brokerage CGS International.Nongshim CEO Cho Yong-chul told employees at the start of 2026 that the company's business principle for the year was \"Global Agility & Growth,\" urging staff to expand its overseas footprint.Otoki CEO Hwang Sung-man said at a shareholder meeting in March 2025 that the company, best known for its Jin Ramen, would prioritize \"exploring global markets\" and aim for an overseas sales revenue of 1.1 trillion won ($746 million) by 2030. CGS' Oh said companies are looking beyond South Korea's shores because the domestic market is saturated. For example, Nongshim, best known for its Shin Ramyeon brand, holds over 60% market share in South Korea. \"Their main product was first invented in 1970s and 80s. And those products, [the] same products, is selling every year, [with] no marketing cost,\" she said.South Korea's demographic decline also limits long-term domestic growth, Oh added, pushing companies to look abroad. As a result, noodle makers have leaned into K-pop's global reach, signing popular ambassadors and icons to increase their overseas appeal. Nongshim named SM Entertainment girl group Aespa as global ambassadors in late 2025, following a collaboration with Netflix on a K-pop Demon Hunters-themed noodle line. Otoki has tapped BTS member Jin as its brand model for Jin Ramen.

Beyond a saturated market, South Korea's instant noodle manufacturers face government-imposed limits on price increases, restricting their ability to offset rising costs, Macquarie said.Overseas markets, on the other hand, allow companies to set higher average selling prices, Oh said. She added that in China and other Asian markets, average prices can be 30%-50% higher than in South Korea, while in the U.S., average prices can be roughly double.Macquarie said that the dominant Japanese and Korean brands have benefited from shifting consumption patterns due to their focus on \"product innovation and cultivating a premium brand image.\"Samyang Foods was identified as a key beneficiary, with Macquarie projecting it will be able to increase its U.S. market share to 23.9% by 2028, from the current 11.4%. \"We believe premium instant noodles with strong product innovation will be the key driver for US market,\" Macquarie said.Samyang Foods is known for its Buldak line of spicy instant noodles, which gained popularity in 2014 for the \"fire noodle challenge,\" in which participants tried to eat the noodles without drinking water.The trend led to regulatory scrutiny in 2024 when Danish authorities briefly recalled some Buldak products over high capsaicin levels, which posed a serious health risk. The recall was later reversed.SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA - JUNE 17: The Anjum family, on vacation from Pakistan, picks out varieties of the Buldak Samyang instant noodles from the CU \"Ramyun Library\" convenience store, a popular tourist attraction, on Monday, June 17, 2024, in the Hongdae district of Seoul, South Korea.\n(Photo by Jintak Han/The Washington Post via Getty Images)The Washington Post | The Washington Post | Getty Images",

Contributor | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesRussian President Vladimir Putin has received an invitation to join the U.S.' \"Board of Peace\" for Gaza, the Kremlin said Monday.Kremlin Spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Moscow would study the details of the proposal to join the peace council created by U.S. President Donald Trump late last year. The \"Board of Peace\" is seen as a vehicle for maintaining a fragile ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, and to oversee the reconstruction of Gaza after their protracted conflict.\"President Putin has indeed received an offer through diplomatic channels to join this Board of Peace. We are currently studying all the details of this proposal,\" Peskov told Russian state news agency TASS. \"We hope to contact the U.S. side to clarify all the details,\" he added.Trump has reportedly invited a number of world leaders, including Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney and Argentine President Javier Milei, to join the Board of Peace for Gaza, which will be part of the larger Board of Peace, Bloomberg reported Saturday.Several other nations, including Hungary, India, Jordan, Greece, Cyprus, and Pakistan confirmed Board of Peace invitations, AP News reported on Sunday.However, the Trump administration reportedly wants nations to pay $1 billion to remain on the board in perpetuity, Bloomberg noted, citing a draft charter for the proposed group.If confirmed, Putin's invitation to join the peace council would raise eyebrows given his oversight of an ongoing war against Russia's neighbor Ukraine. Hundreds of thousands of soldiers and civilians are estimated to have died in the war, which is approaching its four-year anniversary in February.CNBC has contacted the White House for confirmation of Putin's invitation.On Saturday, the U.S. also released the names of those who will sit on a \"founding Executive Board\" of the council, with the list including former U.K. Prime Minister Tony Blair, Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, and U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, among several others.Israel is unhappy with how the \"Board of Peace\" is unfolding, with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office releasing a statement on Friday commenting, \"the announcement regarding the composition of the Gaza Executive Board, which is subordinate to the Board of Peace, was not coordinated with Israel and runs contrary to its policy.\"— CNBC'S Kate Dore contributed reporting to this story.",

Evelyn Hockstein | ReutersThe Education Department announced on Friday that it will delay the implementation of wage garnishment and other involuntary collection efforts affecting defaulted student loan borrowers.The department said the delay affects involuntary collections on federal student loans through wage garnishments and the Treasury Offset Program, which is used to seize some or all of borrowers' payments from the government, including tax refunds and Social Security benefits.Read more CNBC personal finance coverageUnexpected expenses take 10% of retirees' income, on average, research showsMore employers worry about workers' financial wellbeing, research showsRepublicans want to end the 'marriage penalty' for this childcare tax creditEducation Department to delay collections on defaulted student loansTrump pitches direct payments for health care.

Before that announcement, collections had been paused since 2020 in response to the Covid-19 pandemic. Student loan borrowers who fail to make on-time monthly payments for more than 270 days are typically considered in default on their loans. At that point, the federal government has the right to seize up to 15% of borrowers' after-tax wages — as well as a portion of their Social Security income and entire tax refunds, where applicable — to repay the debt. Roughly 5 million borrowers were in default, and that number was expected to grow to nearly 10 million in the coming months, the Department of Education said in April. Around 9 million people are currently in default on their education debt, according to a recent estimate by Protect Borrowers, an advocacy organization.After the initial announcement about collection efforts, the agency has changed course on the policy several times. In June, it paused the plan to garnish Social Security payments.Then in December, the department confirmed around 1,000 borrowers would receive notification of intent to garnish wages during the week of Jan. 7, with more notices to follow. On Jan. 7, Protect Borrowers sent a letter to McMahon cosigned by the NAACP, American Federation of Teachers and several other organizations, urging the department to \"immediately halt its plan to resume garnishment of millions of struggling borrowers' wages.\"\"After months of pressure and countless horror stories from borrowers, the Trump Administration says it has abandoned plans to snatch working people's hard-earned money directly from their paychecks simply for falling behind on their student loans,\" Aissa Canchola Bañez, policy director at Protect Borrowers, said in a statement.— CNBC reporter Annie Nova contributed to this report.",

Ro Khanna on Friday reintroduced a bill that would curb institutional investors from buying up housing,  leveraging a similar call made recently by President Donald Trump.Trump said in a Truth Social post on Jan. 7 that he would be \"immediately taking steps to ban large institutional investors from buying more single-family homes.\"Trump's remark was one of a flurry of populist economic moves by the president as he races to address voter concerns about affordability ahead of the 2026 midterm elections.A recent Marist poll found that just 36% of Americans approved of Trump's handling of the economy, while 57% disapproved. That is a significant headwind for Trump's fellow Republicans in Congress as they try to hang onto their razor-thin majorities in the House of Representatives and Senate.In a statement to CNBC, Khanna invoked Trump's recent support for blocking institutional investors from buying up housing. \"If President Trump is serious about taking on Wall Street landlords, Congress should pass my bill and he should sign it into law,\" Khanna said. \"Homes should be owned by people, not wealthy corporate landlords who are buying up single-family homes and pushing the dream of homeownership out of reach for too many Americans.\" Read more CNBC politics coverageRussia watches as ally Iran edges closer to collapse.

Thom Tillis vows to block Trump's Fed nominees following Powell probeWhile bill text was not immediately available, Khanna's office told CNBC that the Stop Wall Street Landlords Act would prohibit large institutional investors from taking advantage of home-related tax breaks, including mortgage interest, insurance and depreciation deductions. The bill would also require federal and government-backed agencies such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to prohibit large institutional investors from purchasing mortgages on single-family homes. Large Institutional investors who sell single-family homes more than 18 months after the bill's enactment would be slapped with a real estate transfer tax equal to 100% of the home's sale value. In prior versions of the bill, including one introduced in late 2024, a large institutional investor was defined as a person or firm with assets exceeding $100 million. Khanna has 13 cosponsors on the bill so far, all Democrats. But it's possible that Trump's call for an end to large investors in the single-family home market may prompt some House GOP members to join Khanna's effort.In an interview with CNBC, Khanna said he's willing to work with Trump on legislation \"if it's actually going to help the working class.\" \"If he calls me up, I'll help lead the bill,\" Khanna said. Trump is set to speak at the World Economic Forum in Davos on Wednesday, where the president said he will address his housing proposal. \"I will discuss this topic, including further Housing and Affordability proposals, and more, at my speech in Davos,\" Trump said on Truth Social.",

    "body": "Recently the Australian Senate passed a law to ban children under 16 from having social media accounts including TikTok, Facebook, Snapchat, Reddit, X. Matt Cardy | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesAustralia's social media ban for children under the age of 16 has grabbed global attention, and governments worldwide are considering implementing similar policies, with the U.K. seen as likely to be next. The Australian government's Online Safety Amendment Act came into effect on December 10, and included major social media platforms, including Reddit, X, Meta's Instagram, Alphabet's YouTube, Bytedance's TikTok. The platforms were forced to implement age verification methods to ensure under-16s are unable to create an account, and the companies can face fines up to 49.5 million Australian dollars ($32 million) for not complying. Although teenagers, tech giants, and experts have had mixed reactions since the ban came into force, governments globally are drafting bills to implement an Australia-style ban. \"This is a global issue, and governments everywhere are under pressure to respond,\" Daisy Greenwell, co-founder of U.K.-based Smartphone Free Childhood, told CNBC. SFC is a grassroots campaign urging parents to delay giving children smartphones and social media access.\"We're already seeing countries move in this direction, and as confidence builds and evidence accumulates, more will follow. No one thinks the status quo is working for children, parents, or society – and this is one of the clearest policy responses currently on the table,\" Greenwell added. Other countries that are considering an under-16s social media ban include the U.K., France, Denmark, Spain, Germany, Italy and Greece. The U.S. is trailing behind on this front with a national ban being unlikely, however there is certainly state and local interest, according to Ravi Iyer, a managing director of the University of Southern California Marshall School's Neely Center. Iyer has worked closely with social psychologist Jonathon Haidt who wrote the renowned book The Anxious Generation, about the harmful impacts of social media and smartphones on children and teens. \"It's really hard to predict Federal policy, but it is one of the few bipartisan issues left, so it certainly is possible,\" Iyer said in emailed comments. \"I'm more confident at the state level and I believe we will see a few U.S. states enact such a policy in the next couple years.\"Lawmakers in California and Texas are looking at bringing in state-level bans in 2026. But governments looking to implement such bans could face resistance from the tech giants. Following Australia's move, community-focused forum Reddit launched a lawsuit, arguing that the new law goes too far by restricting political discussion online. Facebook and Instagram owner Meta urged Canberra to reconsider the ban. And in a statement to users explaining how the restrictions work, Elon Musk's X said: \"It's not our choice – it's what the Australian law requires.\"U.K. set to vote on social media ban Meanwhile, calls for a social media ban for under-16s in the U.K. have grown rapidly at the beginning of this year. The U.K.'s House of Lords is expected to vote this week to amend the Children's Wellbeing and Schools Bill to include a social media ban for under-16s. Greenwell's SFC launched an email campaign this week, which saw more than 100,000 emails sent to local U.K. lawmakers. The SFC template email urged the government to set \"reasonable, age-appropriate boundaries that protect children's wellbeing.\" \"We consistently see that the more time children spend on smartphones and social media, the worse their mental health outcomes tend to be. If these platforms are no longer available, the network effects collapse – and young people can reconnect with each other and with the real world,\" Greenwell told CNBC. U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer has even backed the idea saying \"we need to better protect children from social media\" and that he's studying Australia's ban. \"All options are on the table in relation to what further protections we can put in place - whether that's under-16s on social media or an issue I am very concerned about, under fives and screen time,\" Starmer said last week. \"Children are turning up age four at reception [the first year of school] having spent far too much time on screens,\" he added.Meanwhile, U.K. health secretary Wes Streeting asked The Anxious Generation author Haidt to address his officials at an event to push for stricter limits on young people. France is also a strong contender as it debates two bills, one backed by French President Emmanuel Macron, to prevent social media access for under 15s, France24 reported last week. France's public health watchdog ANSES outlined that social media's negative effects are \"numerous\" and well documented. USC's Iyer said that if a teen ban becomes a global norm, it alleviates the pressure on young people to self-police. \"One of the primary goals of the law is to change the norm, such that teens don't feel pressure to use social media because all their friends are doing so\" Iyer said. \"It's not really a realistic choice to abstain if you feel that all your friends are using a particular platform. If we can solve that problem and the majority of teens are off of social media, we'll have done a lot of good,\" he added. Read more",

    "body": "Scott Bessent, US treasury secretary, during an Economic Club of Minnesota event in Golden Valley, Minnesota, US, on Thursday, Jan. 8, 2026. Ben Brewer | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Sunday said it's \"very unlikely\" that the Supreme Court will overturn President Donald Trump's use of emergency powers to impose tariffs, with a potential decision from the court looming as early as this week. \"I believe that it is very unlikely that the Supreme Court will overrule a president's signature economic policy,\" Bessent said on NBC's \"Meet the Press.\" \"They did not overrule Obamacare, I believe that the Supreme Court does not want to create chaos.\" In June, the Supreme Court upheld a key Affordable Care Act provision that set up a panel to recommend preventive care services that insurers must provide at no cost to patients.Bessent's comments come one day after Trump said he would impose a new slate of tariffs on goods coming from Europe until \"a Deal is reached for the Complete and Total purchase of Greenland.\" Trump did not specify in his Truth Social post which statute he was invoking to impose the tariffs, though the move appears to mirror the \"liberation day\" duties he has imposed on dozens of nations under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. The tariffs on goods from Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and Finland will begin at 10% on Feb. 1, Trump said. They will then escalate to 25% on June 1, Trump said. The Supreme Court is set to rule on Trump's use of the IEEPA to impose tariffs before the end of its term, but a decision could come as soon as this week. IEEPA gives the president wide latitude to use economic tools in response to an \"unusual and extraordinary threat.\"Read more CNBC politics coverageRussia watches as ally Iran edges closer to collapse.

Leaders in Greenland, Denmark and across Europe have widely rejected Trump's demands to take over the island. European leaders of countries targeted by the new tariffs responded on Sunday. \"Tariff threats undermine transatlantic relations and risk a dangerous downward spiral. We will continue to stand united and coordinated in our response,\" the leaders of Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden and the United Kingdom said in a joint statement.\"We stand in full solidarity with the Kingdom of Denmark and the people of Greenland. Building on the process begun last week, we stand ready to engage in a dialogue based on the principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity that we stand firmly behind,\" the statement read.Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio met with Danish Foreign Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen and Greenland's Minister of Foreign Affairs Vivian Motzfeldt at the White House last week in a meeting that Rasmussen described as \"frank but constructive.\"After the meeting, the group said the U.S. and Denmark would establish a high-level working group to chart Greenland's future.The Trump administration claims that a U.S. acquisition of Greenland is critical to national security to counter the expansion of Russia and China in the region. CNBC has reached out to the White House and the Treasury Department to clarify what statute Trump is using to impose the new European tariffs.CORRECTION: Vivian Motzfeldt is Greenland's Minister of Foreign Affairs.

Over the weekend, U.S. President Donald Trump and European leaders exchanged tense rhetoric over the Arctic territory, with Trump threatening tariffs on eight European countries and demanding control of Greenland, which is part of Denmark.European leaders responded by calling the threats \"completely wrong\" and \"unacceptable.\"Over in Asia, China released its fourth-quarter GDP numbers, along with December figures for retail sales, urban investment and industrial output. Hong Kong Hang Seng index tumbled 1.07%, and the mainland Chinese CSI 300 fell marginally.Japan's Nikkei 225 lost 0.65% and ended at 53,583.57, marking three straight losing sessions, while the Topix was down marginally to 3,656.4.

    "body": "HSINCHU, TAIWAN - APRIL 16: The entrance to a factory of the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), which is a Taiwanese multinational semiconductor contract manufacturing and design company, in Hsinchu, Taiwan, on April 16, 2025.  Daniel Ceng | Anadolu | Getty ImagesThe U.S.-Taiwan deal aimed at expanding chip production capacity in the U.S. is unlikely to fully wean Washington off the island's most advanced semiconductors anytime soon, several analysts told CNBC, leaving the so-called \"silicon shield\" largely intact for now.Taiwan dominates global chip production, with the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company producing most of the world's advanced chips. Nearly one-third of global demand for new computing power is estimated to be fabricated in Taiwan.   The island's central role in the global semiconductor supply chain has made preserving its de facto autonomy — and deterring any Chinese attack — a strategic priority for the U.S. and its allies, an idea referred to as the \"Silicon Shield.\" Beijing claims territorial control over the democratically-governed island. As part of a trade deal struck Thursday, the Taiwanese government promised to guarantee $250 billion in credit to its chip and technology companies to expand their production capacity in the U.S. Taiwanese companies will also enjoy higher quotas for tariff-free imports of their chips into the U.S. In return, Washington would lower its levies on most goods from Taiwan to 15% from 20%, and waive tariffs on generic drugs and ingredients, aircraft components and natural resources unavailable domestically.The goal is to bring 40% of Taiwan's entire semiconductor supply chain to the U.S., Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told CNBC on Thursday. But experts doubt the plan would be easy, given Taipei's hard line on keeping its most advanced technology at home.Taiwan's \"silicon shield\" will remain strong through the end of the decade, with the world's most critical advanced capacity concentrated on the island, said Sravan Kundojjala, an analyst at SemiAnalysis.Taiwanese authorities restricted TSMC's overseas fabrication plants from operating technologies at least two generations behind those developed domestically, known as the N-2 rule.The semiconductor ecosystem cannot be relocated overnight, so the silicon shield may weaken but still exist in the near term.Dennis Lu-Chung WengAssociate professor of political science, Sam Houston State UniversityWhile TSMC produces its most advanced chips using 2-nanometer technology, or nodes, at home, its Arizona plant has only recently begun producing advanced 4-nanometer chips for U.S. customers, with plans to scale up to 2-nanometer and A16 nodes by 2030. In semiconductor manufacturing, smaller nanometer sizes mean denser transistors, which boost processing speed and improve energy efficiency.That four- to- five-year lag ensures Taiwan retains its advantage, said Kundojjala, adding that the global economy would face a \"depression-level event if Taiwan were invaded tomorrow.\" A spokesperson for China's foreign ministry said at a news conference Friday that Beijing \"firmly opposed any agreements signed between Taiwan and countries that have diplomatic relations with China,\" urging the U.S. to stick to the \"one-China principle.\"  Wendell Huang, CFO of TSMC, told CNBC on Thursday that the company will continue developing its most advanced technologies in Taiwan due to the need for \"very intensive collaboration\" between its domestic research and development teams and manufacturing operations. \"We'll be sending hundreds of engineers back and forth [between] different sites in Taiwan. Therefore, it will stay in Taiwan when we ramp [up] the most leading-edge technology,\" Huang said. Still, the world's largest contract chipmaker has already pledged to invest $165 billion into chip fabrication and processing facilities in the U.S., along with a research and development lab, supplying customers such as Nvidia and Apple. Wu Cheng-wen, who oversees Taiwan's National Science and Technology Council, told the Financial Times last year that it was crucial for Taiwan to keep its cutting-edge research and development at home and ensure that the domestic industry would not be \"hollowed out.\"\"If we move our R&D overseas, it'll be dangerous for us,\" Wu said in the interview. Hurdles with U.S. onshoring Shifting chip production away from Taiwan will be difficult, analysts said. Taiwan's engineering talent pipeline and production capabilities in the semiconductor supply chain, especially in advanced fabrication, are \"not replicable at scale anywhere else,\" said William Reinsch, a senior adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. The lack of trained workers and higher production costs have led to delays in TSMC's U.S. plant openings, Reinsch said, adding that the new trade deal does little to address these constraints. He expects fulfilment of the pledged investment commitments to take longer than expected and is unlikely to reach the promised level. \"The semiconductor ecosystem cannot be relocated overnight, so the silicon shield may weaken but still exist in the near term,\" said Dennis Lu-Chung Weng, an associate professor of political science at Sam Houston State University. \"The bigger question is what happens after Trump: if future U.S. administrations keep pushing for large-scale relocation, Taiwan losing its exclusive advantage becomes less a question of if and more a question of when,\" Weng cautioned.watch nowTaiwanese officials have stressed the need to diversify its economic model, encourage more industries to grow, and bolster its defense capabilities to counter China's military pressure. A Chinese invasion of Taiwan remains a low-possibility event, and the trade deal is unlikely to change Beijing's calculus, said Ava Shen, a Taiwan and Chinese foreign policy expert at Eurasia Group. The mainland authorities would focus more on their military balance vis-à-vis the U.S. and the level of American defense support for Taipei, Shen said.",

    "body": "U.S.President Donald Trump arrives at Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport, in Michigan, U.S., January 13, 2026. Evelyn Hockstein | ReutersEight NATO members' goods sent to the U.S. will face escalating tariffs \"until such time as a Deal is reached for the Complete and Total purchase of Greenland,\" President Donald Trump announced Saturday.The tariffs targeting Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and Finland will start at 10% on Feb. 1, Trump wrote in a Truth Social post.The tariffs will shoot up to 25% on June 1, the president said.The penalties would presumably stack on top of the existing U.S. tariffs already levied on goods from these countries.Tariffs imposed by the U.S. on its allies already average about 15% on goods from the European Union countries in Trump's crosshairs and roughly 10% on imports from the United Kingdom, with rates varying by sector. In sensitive areas such as metals and certain autos, stacked measures have already pushed effective tariffs into the mid-teens to mid-20% range.The imposition of tariffs on one or more members of the EU, which comprises 27 nations, means the new tariffs would apply to all. Trump's demands now threaten the EU-U.S. trade agreement struck in August. Manfred Weber, a senior member of the European Parliament (MEP), said the EU trade deal with the U.S. is \"not possible at this stage.\"\"The EPP is in favour of the EU-U.S. trade deal, but given Donald Trump's threats regarding Greenland, approval is not possible at this stage,\" he wrote in a post on X. \"The 0% tariffs on U.S. products must be put on hold.\"Ambassadors from the EU will convene for an emergency meeting on Sunday, Reuters reported. Cyprus, which holds the six-month rotating EU presidency, called the meeting, which is set to start at 5 p.m. local time (11 a.m. ET).Tariff strategyTrump's post suggested that the new tariffs on European allies are being imposed in response to the countries' moving troops to Greenland. They took that step as the Trump administration has floated utilizing the U.S. military as part of its ramped-up efforts to acquire the Danish territory.The eight countries \"have journeyed to Greenland, for purposes unknown,\" Trump wrote. \"This is a very dangerous situation for the Safety, Security, and Survival of our Planet.\"A day earlier, Trump hinted that he may pursue a tariff strategy on Greenland similar to the one he used to force foreign countries to lower drug prices.\"I may do that for Greenland too. I may put a tariff on countries if they don't go along with Greenland, because we need Greenland for national security,\" he said at the White House on Friday.While the president did not cite specific legal statutes in his Truth Social announcement for his latest moves, it appears to mirror his controversial use of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, a law that grants the president broad powers during an \"unusual and extraordinary threat.\"The Supreme Court could rule as soon as next week on whether to strike down the tariffs imposed under that law and could immediately imperil this new tranche, effectively daring the judiciary to intervene in a fresh trade war.Scott Lincicome, a trade policy scholar at the Cato Institute, warned Saturday that the new threat exposes the fragility of relying on unilateral deals rather than binding treaties.\"Trump's tariff announcement confirms... that his trade deals can be changed on a whim and are unlikely to constrain his daily tariff impulses,\" Lincicome said in a statement. \"Today's threat underscores the empty justifications for Trump's so-called 'emergency' tariffs, which reveal the economic and geopolitical problems that unbounded executive power creates.\"Military personnel believed to be from the German armed Forces Bundeswehr disembark a charter plane upon arrival at Nuuk international airport on Jan. 16, 2026 in Nuuk, Greenland, the day after it arrived transporting Danish military personnel.Alessandro Rampazzo | AFP | Getty ImagesEuropean responseAcross Europe, the targeted nations responded with condemnation, characterizing the tariffs as a hostile act against close military allies that threatens the very fabric of the trans-Atlantic partnership. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, who spearheads the bloc's trade policy, issued a sharp rebuke to the White House's ultimatum, framing the tariffs not just as a trade dispute but as a test of Western values.\"We choose partnership and cooperation,\" von der Leyen wrote in a post on Bluesky shortly after the announcement. \"We choose our businesses. We choose our people.\"Likewise, Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen told MS Now Saturday that Trump's move came as a \"surprise,\" citing a recent \"constructive meeting\" with U.S. Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio. Frederiksen pushed back on Trump's claims regarding troop movements, stating the increased presence is strictly to \"enhance security\" in an Arctic region that is \"no longer a low tension area,\" and was done in \"full transparency\" with U.S. allies.Other European leaders were equally firm. European Council President Antonio Costa said Saturday that the bloc is \"coordinating a joint response\" to the threat.\"The European Union will always be very firm in defending international law, wherever it may be,\" Costa said at a press conference Saturday following the signing of a trade agreement between the EU and South American nations in Paraguay.French President Emmanuel Macron also weighed in, posting on X that \"no intimidation nor threat will influence us.\" Macron warned that \"stabilizing forces have awakened\" and vowed that France would stand firm alongside its neighbors.Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson sternly rejected Trump's tariff threats.\"We will not allow ourselves to be blackmailed,\" he wrote on X, adding that \"only Denmark and Greenland decide on issues concerning Denmark and Greenland.\"EU's foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas warned that the new tariffs play right into the hands of China and Russia. \"China and Russia must be having a field day. They are the ones who benefit from divisions among allies,\" she wrote in a post on X. \"If Greenland's security is at risk, we can address this inside NATO.\"A protester takes part in a demonstration to show support for Greenland in Copenhagen, Denmark, on Jan. 17, 2026.Tom Little | ReutersNATO strain and legal battlesTrump's latest move puts further strain on NATO, the 32-member military alliance established after World War II. The cornerstone of the alliance is an agreement that an attack on any single member is considered an attack on them all.European leaders have warned that any attempt by the U.S. to take Greenland by force could spell the end of NATO.Trump's tariff announcement could signal he is dropping the threat of military action to achieve his longtime goal of taking over the island. But it nevertheless ratchets up pressure on Denmark and the rest of Europe, which have flatly stated that Greenland is not for sale.Some cautioned European leaders to avoid reacting hastily to Trump's tariff threat.\"Just ignore it and wait and see,\" Carsten Brzeski, global head of macro at ING Research, told Reuters. \"Europe has shown that it will not accept everything, and so the tariffs are actually already a step forward compared to the threatened military invasion.\"Lawmakers push for de-escalationAs the White House ramped up pressure, a bipartisan U.S. congressional delegation in Copenhagen pushed back against Trump's narrative.\"There are no pressing security threats to Greenland,\" Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., told reporters Saturday morning.Coons and Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, led the trip to \"restore a sense of trust\" with Greenland, Coons said. The two senators disputed Trump's characterization of European troop movements as a conspiracy to block U.S. acquisition of the island, instead praising the deployments as NATO partners \"stepping up,\" Coons said, to secure the High North against Russian aggression.\"Seeing active training and deployments into one of the harshest, most remote places on Earth... we should take as an encouraging signal,\" Coons said.Murkowski emphasized that despite the president's attacks, support for Denmark remains strong across party lines. \"You cannot allow this to become a partisan matter,\" she said. \"Support for our friends and allies... should not be.\"Likewise, Sens. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., and Thom Tillis, R-N.C., both members of the Bipartisan Senate NATO Observer Group, warned that threatening tariffs on NATO would raise costs for U.S. families while benefiting adversaries like Russia and China. In a joint statement, the lawmakers said: \"Continuing down this path is bad for America, bad for American businesses and bad for America's allies… At a time when many Americans are already concerned about the cost of living, these tariffs would raise prices for both families and businesses.\"The lawmakers said Danish and Greenlandic officials want to \"partner with the United States,\" urging the administration to \"turn off the threats and turn on diplomacy.\"— Terri Cullen contributed to this report.This is breaking news.

The duties would come on top of existing export tariffs to the U.S., currently standing at 10% for the U.K. and 15% for the EU.watch nowOver the weekend, Starmer said that the U.K.'s position on Greenland was clear, although he, like other European leaders, also looked to appease Trump by saying NATO allies should do more together to address Russian threats across the Arctic.\"Our position on Greenland is very clear – it is part of the Kingdom of Denmark and its future is a matter for the Greenlanders and the Danes,\" Starmer said in a statement released by the British government on Saturday.\"Applying tariffs on allies for pursuing the collective security of NATO allies is completely wrong. We will of course be pursuing this directly with the U.S. administration,\" he added.Trump contends that U.S. ownership of Greenland, which is part of the Kingdom of Denmark, would make the world safer and deter Russia and Chinese activity in the Arctic island. Moscow and Beijing have dismissed his claims while European leaders insist that Greenland's future is a matter for the island and Denmark.Trump whispererEuropean countries are reportedly considering retaliatory levies and wider economic counter-measures against the U.S. but the U.K. has traditionally held off from threatening counter-tariffs.Starmer said again on Monday that the use of tariffs to resolve such an issue was \"completely wrong\" and was not \"the right way to resolve differences within an alliance.\"\"A trade war is in no one's interest,\" he said.Still, the PM is known to have a warm and friendly relationship with Trump, despite their political differences. The U.K. was the first country to strike a trade deal with Washington last year, largely owing to Trump's apparent warmth toward the country.

That relationship matters profoundly, not just to our security, but to the prosperity and stability that people here depend upon ... we're determined to keep that relationship strong, constructive and focused on results,\" Starmer said Monday.But, at a time when \"events are moving fast,\" he said that \"what matters most is being clear about the values and motives that drive us.\"\"While we are pragmatic, we are resolute in defending those values when it matters.\"This is a breaking news story, please check for further updates.",

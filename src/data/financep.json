    "body": "If you don't have children and don't plan on having any, many of the \"default\" settings of personal finance may not apply to you. You may not, for instance, plan on leaving legacy wealth, as many parents do, and you certainly don't have to worry about paying for a kid's wedding or college education.But who will take care of you or make decisions on your behalf in the event that you can't make them for yourself? For many Americans, the default answer is, \"my kids.\"If something bad happens and you don't have children who will take care of you, things can get complicated quickly, says Maddy Roche, chief growth officer at Childfree Trust, a fiduciary firm specializing in childfree and permanently childless people.\"Think about some of the structures that assume that you have children, whether it be insurance planning, estate planning, medical relationships,\" she says. \"You can't get an elective surgery unless you have an emergency contact. Those are the things that we run up against when time's too late.\"The solution, she says, is to start thinking about these scenarios early. \"As hard as it is to think about the future, one of the best ways to ensure that you'll be respected in the ways that you crave and deserve is to be proactive,\" she says.Be proactive in your planningJust about every financial professional will tell you that everyone — whether you have kids or not — needs some form of an estate plan, which expresses how you'd like medical and financial decisions to be carried out in the event of your death or incapacitation.This becomes even more important for people whose family strays from the norm, Jay Zigmont, a certified financial planner specializing in childfree clients, previously told CNBC Make It.Because health care and government systems look for next-of-kin, there may be no one obvious to contact in the event you get into an accident while out of town, for instance, he says: \"That means the government or health-care system will be making decisions for you.\"To avoid those scenarios, you'll need documents in place, such as powers of attorney and a health-care directive. These documents go by different names in different states, so talk with an attorney about your specific needs, but the gist is that they lay out your wishes and designate a decision-maker for you should you become incapacitated.These wishes could be as consequential as whether or not you want to be on a respirator or as straightforward as what to do with your cats while you're in the hospital.Designate a trusted friend or relativeFor many childfree people, figuring out who will execute your plan comes with some complications. You may, for instance, want to nominate an extended family member to oversee your care — but that could create conflicts of interest if that person stands to inherit your estate.\"Some people feel like they need to offer monetary compensation for these roles. Say, for instance, you have a long-lost nephew,\" she says. \"Are we sure he won't feel conflicted in terms of helping you manage your affairs — that you'll stay in the kind of quality facility you need if he feels his inheritance is on the line?\"In some states, you may be able to hire a fiduciary to execute your estate — someone who is bound by law to act in your best financial interest. For the most part, though, you'll have to cultivate what Roche calls a \"strategic relationship\" with a trusted friend or relative.The key, she says, is to make sure you're on the same page as early as possible.\"You need to start to think about your wishes and make sure they're documented and make sure the people you're nominating really know what you want to happen,\" Roche says. \"Talk with people about what these roles are and what you expect of them. It's all important to be thinking about.\"Want to level up your AI skills? Sign up for Smarter by CNBC Make It's new online course, How To Use AI To Communicate Better At Work.

    "body": "Feeling financially unsafe in a relationship can happen to anyone, even billionaires.Kim Kardashian said her ex-husband Kanye West's unpredictable spending habits — including suddenly purchasing and giving away multiple Lamborghinis at a time — contributed to her decision to end the marriage in 2021, she told host Alex Cooper in an October episode of the \"Call Her Daddy\" podcast.\"Not feeling safe, not even physically, maybe emotionally or even financially,\" Kardashian said. \"That's a really unsettling feeling.\"Whether it's to pay bills or afford housing and food, we need money in life — which is why a lack of financial safety, or financial insecurity, is scary for most people, says Erika Wasserman, a financial therapist and CEO of Your Financial Therapist based in Parkland, Florida.The average person's unpredictable spending habits may not involve purchasing five Lamborghinis at a time, Wasserman says, but it can look like impulsively buying five Lego sets or taking out a new line of credit. Any situation where you don't see eye to eye with a partner you share finances with has the possibility of causing a significant amount of strain, she says.\"When you can't trust the partner that you're with on how you're spending, saving and investing money, you become scared and fearful,\" Wasserman says. \"Then, it rolls into other aspects of your relationship.\"Financial intimacy can make or break your relationshipFinancial intimacy should be just as important as emotional or sexual intimacy in a relationship, yet people often skip talking about their finances because it's taboo or uncomfortable, Wasserman says.An October study by business software company Intuit found that 37% of U.S. consumers start sharing their salaries around the time they decide to exclusively date their partner. Wasserman says this isn't enough: More people should talk about their finances when committing to serious relationships.Our financial habits impact everything in life. While money isn't why most couples fall in love, once the initial spark fades, financial behaviors can make or break a relationship, Wasserman says.If couples disagree and \"there's no habit changing or plans in place, the spread tends to get bigger,\" Wasserman says. \"That's where you see relationships start splitting apart.\"The No. 1 red flag to look out forWasserman says the biggest red flag to watch for when determining whether you can align financially with a partner is stonewalling. Someone who avoids conversations about money or hides their spending early in a relationship will likely continue that behavior as things progress, she says.\"If you're both willing to work on [financial intimacy], then there's hope for the relationship,\" Wasserman says. \"But if one person's checked out, it doesn't work in any part of your relationship — with sex, with religion, with money. If you're both not willing to work on it and be open, then it's time to evaluate the relationship.\"Foster financial intimacy through storytellingWhen building financial intimacy and safety, focus on sharing your financial habits through storytelling, like sharing how often you went out to eat as a kid or your experiences grocery shopping with your parents. Direct questions about financial habits \"tend to put people on guard,\" Wasserman says.If you do need to be direct, which Wasserman says can be important and appropriate at times, do it with \"compassion and empathy.\" Understand that your partner may have a different background than you, and that can shape how they view conversations around money.Ultimately, the best thing you can do to set yourself up for success is to just \"start the conversation,\" Wasserman says. \"Financial intimacy takes time. It's grown together. It's open conversations. It's being vulnerable.\"Want to level up your AI skills? Sign up for Smarter by CNBC Make It's new online course, How To Use AI To Communicate Better At Work.

    "body": "Member of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors Lisa Cook speaks on \"The Outlook for the Economy and Monetary Policy\" at the Brookings Institution in Washington, D.C., U.S., November 3, 2025. Kevin Lamarque | ReutersFederal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook, in her first policy speech since President Donald Trump tried to remove her from office, said Monday that she supported the recent interest rate reduction and indicated she would be open to more.Since Trump made his move in August to sack Cook on accusations of mortgage fraud, she has kept a relatively low profile outside of the court battles that have kept her in her position at the central bank.In remarks before the Brookings Institution in Washington, D.C., the policymaker laid out her views on the economy and where she thinks monetary policy should land. Generally, she sees the economy as solid with risks to both the Fed's goals of low unemployment and stable inflation.Cook said she sided with the 10-2 vote on the Federal Open Market Committee to lower the central bank's benchmark interest rate by a quarter percentage point, the second meeting in a row that saw a cut.\"I viewed that decision as appropriate, because I believe that the downside risks to employment are greater than the upside risks to inflation. I view the latest reduction in the fed funds rate as another gradual step toward normalization,\" she said.Trump has been blocked by courts from removing Cook in what has been seen as a pivotal issue for central bank independence. Though White House officials have said Cook lied in forms she filled out for federally guaranteed home mortgages, she has not been convicted of anything nor have any charges even been brought. Cook has cited \"clerical errors\" in the loan applications. She declined to comment on the matter during a question-and-answer session, saying \"it would be inappropriate\" while noting she is \"beyond grateful\" for the support she has received.In the meantime, she has continued her duties at the Fed, which lowered its key federal funds rate in September for the first time since December.As for the path going forward, Cook said she is sticking with a data-dependent position. FOMC officials in September indicated an additional cut is likely before the end of the year.\"As always, I determine my monetary policy stance each meeting based on the incoming data from a wide variety of sources, the evolution of my outlook, and the balance of risks,\" she said. \"Every meeting, including December's, is a live meeting.\"\"Certainly we want to see if tariff effects are persistent, to see if firms are waiting to raise prices, to see what they've done with inventory,\" she added. \"So there's a lot to look at. There's a lot to anticipate with the December meeting coming up.\"Fed Chair Jerome Powell rattled markets during his Wednesday post-meeting news conference when he said the December cut is not a sure thing. Powell noted a wide dispersion of opinions on the committee, known more often for its consensus approach to policy.\"Looking ahead, policy is not on a predetermined path,\" Cook said, using what has become boilerplate language for Fed officials. \"We are at a moment when risks to both sides of the dual mandate are elevated.\"On inflation, she said Trump's tariffs have not fully made their way through the economy. However, she said the most likely outcome is a \"one-time increase\" in prices not likely to fuel inflation over the longer term.",

Christian Monterrosa | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesPresident Donald Trump on Monday night explicitly called on New York City residents to vote for Andrew Cuomo over Democratic nominee Zohran Mamdani in the mayoral election.Trump's endorsement of Cuomo's independent candidacy came on the eve of the election, and hours after Tesla CEO Elon Musk similarly endorsed the former New York governor.Both Trump and Musk said that voting for the Republican nominee, Curtis Sliwa, was effectively a vote for the state Assembly member Mamdani, who has consistently held a solid lead in polls for the general election.\"A vote for Curtis Sliwa (who looks much better without the beret!) is a vote for Mamdani,\" Trump wrote in a Truth Social post.\"Whether you personally like Andrew Cuomo or not, you really have no choice,\" Trump wrote.\"You must vote for him, and hope he does a fantastic job. He is capable of it, Mamdani is not!\"Cuomo is a Democrat. He is running as an independent because he was defeated by Mamdani in the party's primary in June.\"Donald Trump is threatened by our campaign,\" Mamdani said in an interview on CNN .\"What a pair!\" he said when Musk's name was mentioned.\"They've picked Andrew Cuomo because they know he will be the puppet they want, right there in New York City,\" Mamdani said.Mamdani's spokesman told The New York Times that Trump's endorsement of Cuomo was \"absolutely the nail in the coffin for Andrew Cuomo.\"Read more CNBC politics coverageShutdown cost government contractors $12B so far: U.S. Chamber of CommerceThe big takeaways from the Trump-Xi meeting — what the truce coversShipping sector skeptical Trump's latest trade truce with China will reverse import declineTrump-Xi meeting nears with high stakes and hopes, but few detailsGovernment shutdown could cost U.S. economy up to $14 billion, CBO saysIn the same post on Monday night, Trump threatened to withhold federal funds from New York if Mamdani, who is a self-identified democratic socialist, wins on Tuesday.\"If Communist Candidate Zohran Mamdani wins the Election for Mayor of New York City, it is highly unlikely that I will be contributing Federal Funds, other than the very minimum as required, to my beloved first home, because of the fact that, as a Communist, this once great City has ZERO chance of success, or even survival!\" Trump wrote.Mamdani is not a communist.Musk, in a post on his social media site X, wrote, \"Remember to vote tomorrow in New York! Bear in mind that a vote for Curtis is really a vote for Mumdumi or whatever his name is.The Times reported on Monday that Mamdani, during a campaign event in Queens, said that he had known \"for months\" that Trump would back Mr. Cuomo.\"In these final days, what was rumored, what was feared, has become naked and unabashed,\" Mamdani reportedly said.\"The MAGA movement's embrace of Andrew Cuomo is reflective of Donald Trump's understanding that this would be the best mayor for him — not the best mayor for New York City, not the best mayor for New Yorkers, but the best mayor for Donald Trump and his administration.\"",

    "body": "Warren Buffett speaks during the Berkshire Hathaway Annual Shareholders Meeting in Omaha, Nebraska on May 3, 2025.CNBCWarren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway may have quietly trimmed its massive Apple stake again in the third quarter, a new regulatory filing suggests.In its latest quarterly report, Berkshire said the cost basis of its consumer products equity holdings fell by roughly $1.2 billion from the prior quarter. That category is dominated by the giant conglomerate's Apple position, implying the decline likely reflects additional sales of Apple shares.Apple's stock jumped more than 24% in the third quarter, a rally that would have offered Buffett an attractive opportunity to take profits.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconApple year to dateBuffett went on a head-turning selling spree in Apple in 2024, slashing two-thirds of the shares Berkshire held in a surprising move for the famously long-term-focused investor. Berkshire also trimmed its Apple stake in the second quarter of this year. The iPhone maker was still Berkshire's largest holding at the end of June, when it controlled 280 million shares worth $57 billion.Investors will get more clarity about the exact size of Berkshire's Apple position when it releases its detailed 13F filing it makes to the Securities and Exchange Commission later this month. That will disclose any changes to individual stock holdings through Sept. 30.Buffett had previously hinted that selling down the Apple stake was for tax reasons, but others speculated that the size of the sales suggested the so-called Oracle of Omaha was also concerned about Apple's high valuation. Some thought it was also part of portfolio management, as the Apple stake had grown so big that at one time it accounted for more than half of Berkshire's investment portfolio.Berkshire has been a net seller of stocks for 12 straight quarters, raising more than $6 billion in cash in the third quarter. Buffett's one-time favorite yardstick for stock market valuations, which measures the total value of all publicly traded U.S. stocks against the entire gross national product of the United States, has climbed to an all-time high, reaching a level that he once described as \"playing with fire.\"",

Santiago | Getty ImagesThe Trump administration told a Rhode Island federal judge on Monday that it would tap billions of dollars in contingency funds to pay 50% of the normal amount of SNAP benefits in November as the U.S. government shutdown persists.The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program provides food stamps to about 42 million low-income Americans.The administration in a court filing told Judge Jack McConnell that it had declined the option he suggested to make full November payments for SNAP benefits by using at least $4 billion from the Child Nutrition Program, as well as from other unspecified funds.Instead, the administration will use all of the $4.65 billion remaining from a contingency fund for SNAP appropriated by Congress for \"November benefits that will be obligated to cover 50% of eligible households' current allotments.\"McConnell, in a ruling on Friday, said the administration could not cease paying SNAP benefits. Before his order, the administration had rejected the idea of using the contingency funds in the face of the shutdown, which began Oct. 1.Prior presidential administrations, including the first one of President Donald Trump, have used contingency funds to continue paying SNAP benefits during government shutdowns.U.S. Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins speaks during a news conference on Capitol Hill on October 31, 2025 in Washington, DC. Anna Moneymaker | Getty ImagesIt is not clear when the benefits will begin being paid out by individual states. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Sunday said that the benefits might be paid by Wednesday.In its filing Monday, the administration said that the U.S. Department of Agriculture \"will fulfill its obligation to expend the full amount of SNAP contingency funds today by generating the table required for States to calculate the benefits available for each eligible household in that State.\"USDA authorized the states to begin disbursing the benefits once the table is issued.Democracy Forward, the advocacy group whose lawyers represented plaintiffs in the lawsuit that led to McConnell's order, criticized the administration for not making full SNAP benefits payments by Monday.\"We are reviewing the administration's submission to the court and considering all legal options to secure payment of full funds,\" said Democracy Forward CEO Skye Perryman in a statement.\"It shouldn't take a court order to force our President to provide essential nutrition that Congress has made clear needs to be provided,\" Perryman said. Massachusetts Gov.

    "body": "Ford Mustang Mach-E EV vehicles at a Ford dealership in Los Angeles, California, US, on Thursday, Oct 16, 2025. Kyle Grillot | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesDETROIT — Sales of all-electric vehicles collapsed last month following the end of up to $7,500 in federal incentives for purchasing an EV, several automakers said Monday.Ford Motor, Kia, Hyundai Motor and Toyota Motor reported massive declines in EV sales as many buyers pulled ahead purchases before the credits ended under changes by the Trump administration.Ford, which ranked third in U.S. EV sales through the third quarter, reported a 25% drop in its year-over-year all-electric October sales. That included a 12% decline for its Mustang Mach-E crossover and a 17% fall for the F-150 Lightning.Toyota reported it sold 18 units of its sole all-electric vehicle, named the BZ, in October. That was down from 1,401 units a year earlier and 61 vehicles the month before.Kia and Hyundai reported their top EV models dropped between 52% and 71% from a year earlier. The declines are notably greater when looking month to month, as September marked the end of a record quarter for EV sales in the U.S. ahead of the credits ending.Some models, such as Hyundai's Ioniq 5 and Ioniq 9 EVs, fell by 80% and 71% from September to October, respectively, according to its reported sales. It was a similar story for comparable vehicles at Kia, which is owned by Hyundai Motor but largely operates separately in the U.S.\"While the expiration of the federal tax credit impacted EV sales in the month of October, we still saw strong demand leading up to that change, and we remain confident that the market is going to reset,\" Hyundai Motor North America CEO Randy Parker told CNBC during a Monday interview.Meanwhile, sales of hybrid vehicles for carmakers are expected to continue to rise. Sales of such models for each of the automakers were bright spots in October, the companies said.Parker said Hyundai's hybrid sales surged 41% last month compared with October 2024, leading its total \"electrified\" vehicle sales, which include EVs, to be up 8%. Pure EV sales, the company said, were down 57% last month compared to October 2024, after a 157% year-over-year increase in September.Only a limited number of automakers report monthly sales, rather than quarterly, but the results are an early indication of the expected fall in EV sales following the end of the federal incentives.\"With the credit now off the table, the market appears to be settling into a more natural rhythm,\" Jessica Caldwell, head of insights for CarMax's Edmunds, said in a Monday blog. \"October marks the start of a reset period: one defined less by incentive-driven urgency and more by buyers motivated by genuine interest in EV ownership.\"Ahead of the EV incentives ending, several automotive executives such as Parker and Ford CEO Jim Farley predicted a massive drop-off in EV sales.Farley late last month said he \"wouldn't be surprised\" if sales of EVs fell to a market share of around 5% after the end of the incentives from a level of 10% to 12% in September.Tesla, at a 43.1% market share, and General Motors, at 13.8%, led the U.S. automotive industry this year in record domestic sales of all-electric vehicles through the third quarter, according to data provided to CNBC from Motor Intelligence.Cox Automotive's Kelley Blue Book estimates EV sales volume in the U.S. hit an all-time high in the third quarter, reaching 438,487 units sold. That marked a 40.7% jump from the previous quarter and an increase of 29.6% year over year.Clarification: This article has been updated to clarify the description of remarks from Farley.",

    "body": "A Pfizer logo is displayed at a research facility in the La Jolla neighborhood of San Diego, California, U.S., Sept. 30, 2025. Mike Blake | ReutersPfizer on Monday said it filed a second lawsuit against Novo Nordisk and Metsera, alleging that the Danish drugmaker's attempt to outbid Pfizer to acquire the obesity biotech is anticompetitive. Pfizer alleges that Ozempic maker Novo Nordisk's proposed acquisition of Metsera would help it maintain its dominant position in the blockbuster obesity market by eliminating a smaller potential competitor, according to the lawsuit filed Monday in the U.S. District Court in Delaware. The suit also alleges that Metsera's controlling shareholders conspired with the obesity biotech and Novo Nordisk. In a statement on Monday, Ambre James Brown, Novo Nordisk's vice president of global media, said \"Pfizer's baseless claims that Novo Nordisk intends to suppress innovation through our offer is false and without merit.\" \"Instead of competing on price, Pfizer has taken the highly unusual and seemingly desperate approach in filing its antitrust lawsuit today,\" Brown said. She added that Novo Nordisk's offer, including the structure of the transaction, complies with all applicable laws and is in the \"best interest\" of patients and Metsera shareholders. In a statement, Metsera said, \"Pfizer is trying to litigate its way to buying Metsera for a lower price than Novo Nordisk.\" The company added that Pfizer's litigation arguments \"are nonsense, and Metsera will address them in court.\"The new suit escalates a heated standoff between Pfizer and Novo Nordisk over Metsera, whose obesity pipeline could yield new competitors in the booming weight loss drug market. Pfizer in September said that it would acquire Metsera for $4.9 billion, or up to $7.3 billion with future payments – a deal that could be the company's golden ticket to enter the space after struggling to bring its own obesity products to market. But Novo Nordisk on Thursday launched a takeover bid valuing the biotech at around $6 billion, triggering a deadline of four business days for Pfizer to renegotiate its offer. On Friday, Pfizer filed its first lawsuit against Novo Nordisk and Metsera seeking to block the biotech from terminating its existing merger deal with Pfizer. That suit, filed in the Delaware Court of Chancery, alleges that Novo Nordisk's offer can't qualify as a superior proposal because it's not reasonably likely to be completed due to its significant regulatory risk.Novo Nordisk helped establish the weight loss drug space, bringing to market highly effective GLP-1 drugs, including the diabetes injection Ozempic and obesity shot Wegovy. But the company has lost its leading position in the market to its chief rival, Eli Lilly, over the last year and has struggled to impress investors with its pipeline. ",

    "body": "watch nowStarbucks on Monday announced it is forming a joint venture with Boyu Capital to operate the company's locations in China.Under the terms of the deal, Boyu, an alternative asset management firm, will pay Starbucks roughly $4 billion to hold up to a 60% interest in the joint venture. Starbucks will hold a 40% stake and maintain its ability to license the brand and intellectual property to the joint venture.The announcement comes after the coffee giant conducted a months-long review of options that included strategic partnerships. Starbucks values its China business at more than $13 billion, the company said. The valuation includes the sale of the controlling stake in the joint venture, combined with the value of both its retained interest and the ongoing licensing fees that will paid to the company in the future.The deal is expected to close in the second quarter of fiscal 2026, pending regulatory approval.Starbucks opened its first store in China in 1999. By 2015, it had grown to become the company's second-largest market, trailing only the United States.\"Building on our positive business momentum, our partnership with Boyu will enable Starbucks China to fully unlock the vast market opportunity,\" Molly Liu, CEO of Starbucks China, said in a statement.Today, the company has roughly 8,000 locations in China, but Starbucks has big ambitions for the market. CEO Brian Niccol told CNBC's Kate Rogers in September that the country could one day have 20,000 or even 30,000 locations nationwide.But in recent years, Starbucks has seen its sales in China plummet, first due to the pandemic and related government restrictions and later caused by increased competition. Rival Luckin Coffee now has more stores in China than Starbucks and has won over customers with lower-priced drinks than the U.S. coffee chain.On Wednesday, the company reported that its fiscal-fourth quarter same-store sales in China increased 2%, fueled by a 9% increase in traffic. However, as Starbucks has leaned into discounting to compete with local rivals, the average ticket at its Chinese cafes has fallen, weighing on the company's profits.While Starbucks executives have continually expressed optimism about the company's long-term prospects in China, its weak performance in the country has weighed on Starbucks' overall financial results.For decades, China's massive population and fast-growing economy have made it an attractive market for U.S. companies. But in recent years, an economic slowdown and greater competition from home-grown brands have made some companies rethink their strategies.Earlier this year, Burger King's parent company Restaurant Brands International bought its struggling China business from TFI Asia Holdings with the goal of selling it to another operator. On the other hand, McDonald's increased its minority stake in its China business from 20% to 48% two years ago, aiming to benefit from the market's growth.",

The news agency reported that people were injured or died after becoming trapped in Tesla vehicles after collisions or battery power losses that prevented doors from opening normally.Tesla design leader Franz Von Holzhausen has said in subsequent press interviews that the company would change the design of its door handles.Tesla competitors, including Rivian, are also reconsidering flush-mounted, or retractable door handle designs.Volkswagen CEO Thomas Schäfer recently said his company's customers don't even want the flush-mounted, electronic doorhandles and VW has no plans to adopt them.Meanwhile, China is expected to implement new vehicle safety standards around door handles, including a requirement to have more clearly marked, accessible and easier-to-use emergency, interior door release mechanisms.China's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology has released draft standards and comments are open through November 22.The NHTSA Tesla probe seeks records concerning all model year, \"2021 Tesla Model Y vehicles manufactured for sale or lease in the United States,\" as well as \"peer vehicles,\" including Tesla Model 3 and Model Y vehicles from model years 2017 to 2022, and \"systems related to opening doors including, door handles, door latches, 12VDC batteries, software,\" and other components.Tesla has until Dec. 10 to provide the records.While Tesla can seek an extension on the deadline from NHTSA, it may face fines of \"$27,874 per violation per day, with a maximum of $139,356,994\" if the company either fails to or refuses to \"respond completely, accurately, or in a timely manner\" to NHTSA's information requests, the agency cautioned in its letter.",

And he accused the government under his predecessor, former President Joe Biden, of waging a \"witch hunt\" against CZ, even as Trump repeatedly denied knowledge of his case.\"My sons are involved in crypto much more than I— me. I— I know very little about it, other than one thing. It's a huge industry,\" he said. \"And if we're not gonna be the head of it, China, Japan, or someplace else is.\"Despite saying he didn't know who CZ is, Trump said Zhao \"was treated really badly by the Biden administration.\"\"They sent him to jail and they really set him up. That's my opinion. I was told about it,\" the president said.\"I don't know the man at all. I don't think I ever met him,\" Trump went on. \"I have no idea who he is. I was told that he was a victim, just like I was and just like many other people, of a vicious, horrible group of people in the Biden administration.\"Trump's claim that he knows nothing about a high-profile clemency recipient comes as he and Republicans have asserted that pardons issued by Biden using an \"autopen\" are invalid because, they contend, the president was not aware of what he was signing.Trump wrote in a Truth Social post in March that many of Biden's pardons are void \"because of the fact that they were done by Autopen. In other words, Joe Biden did not sign them but, more importantly, he did not know anything about them!\"After Republicans on the Oversight Committee issued a report last month on Biden's autopen use, House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., said the former president \"didn't even know what the categories were, apparently, much less the individual people, that he pardoned.\"Binance in 2023 agreed to pay a total of $4.3 billion to settle a multiyear investigation into allegations that the platform's users had made thousands of transactions in support of illicit activities, including terrorism and child abuse.Then-Attorney General Merrick Garland called that fine \"one of the largest corporate penalties in U.S. history.\"Following Trump's election, Zhao mounted an aggressive campaign for clemency, including publicly praising the president and submitting pardon applications, The New York Times reported.Read more CNBC politics coverageShutdown cost government contractors $12B so far: U.S. Chamber of CommerceThe big takeaways from the Trump-Xi meeting — what the truce coversShipping sector skeptical Trump's latest trade truce with China will reverse import declineTrump-Xi meeting nears with high stakes and hopes, but few detailsGovernment shutdown could cost U.S. economy up to $14 billion, CBO saysBinance also recently became financially entangled with World Liberty Financial, a crypto finance platform that sends 75% of token sales revenue to a company linked to Trump and his family.In May, World Liberty co-founder Zach Witkoff — a son of top Trump administration official Steve Witkoff — said his company's stablecoin would be used to facilitate a $2 billion investment in Binance by Emirati state investment firm MGX.Later that same month, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission said it would drop its case against Binance and Zhao.The president announced Zhao's pardon on Oct. 23.Trump was asked in Sunday's CBS interview to address \"the appearance of pay for play.\"\"Well, here's the thing, I know nothing about it because I'm too busy,\" Trump said before a moment of crosstalk.\"I can only tell you this. My sons are into it. I'm glad they are, because it's probably a great industry, crypto. I think it's good. You know, they're running a business, they're not in government,\" he said.Returning to CZ, Trump said: \"I know nothing about the guy, other than I hear he was a victim of weaponization by government. When you say the government, you're talking about the Biden government.\"",

    "body": "Huggies, manufactured by Kimberly-Clark and Band-Aid, manufactured by Kenvue.Getty ImagesKimberly-Clark announced Monday it's struck an agreement to buy Kenvue in a deal valued at $48.7 billion that would create a consumer staples giant.The deal is a combination of cash and stock and totals about $40 billion on an equity basis, excluding the impact of debt. Shares of Kenvue surged 12% Monday, while Kimberly-Clark stock fell 14%.The combined company would bring together brands like Huggies and Kleenex with the likes of Band-Aid and Tylenol. It would include 10 billion-dollar brands, the companies said in a news release. The acquisition would be one of the largest on Wall Street this year.The transaction is expected to close in the second half of 2026.Kimberly-Clark Chairman and CEO Mike Hsu said in a statement that the companies share a \"commitment to developing science and technology to provide extraordinary care.\"\"Over the last several years, Kimberly-Clark has undertaken a significant transformation to pivot our portfolio to higher-growth, higher-margin businesses while rewiring our organization to work smarter and faster,\" Hsu said. \"We have built the foundation and this transaction is a powerful next step in our journey.\"Kenvue, a portfolio of consumer health brands, spun out of Johnson & Johnson in May 2023, marking the biggest shake-up in J&J's nearly 140-year history. Since then, Kenvue shares have fallen almost 35% from their initial public offering price. As of Friday's close, Kenvue traded at about $14 per share for a market cap of roughly $27 billion.J&J has sold all of its remaining stake in the consumer goods giant.watch nowThe deal comes just weeks after President Donald Trump made unfounded claims linking the use of acetaminophen — the active ingredient in Tylenol — during pregnancy to an increased risk of autism, sending Kenvue's stock sharply lower. The company has staunchly pushed back against his administration's accusation, and many medical experts say Tylenol is often the safest and only option for pain and fever relief in pregnant women.Acetaminophen is used by upward of 100 million Americans annually.Kenvue Chair Larry Merlo said in a statement that following a comprehensive strategic review, the board is \"confident this combination represents the best path forward for our shareholders and all other stakeholders.\"Three Kenvue board members will join the Kimberly-Clark board upon the deal's closing. Hsu will continue to serve as chairman and CEO.The combined company would generate estimated 2025 annual net revenue of roughly $32 billion and adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization of approximately $7 billion, according to the release.Kimberly-Clark and Kenvue expect about $1.9 billion in cost synergies from the transaction to be realized in the first three years following the deal's close.The acquisition comes as Kimberly-Clark and the broader consumer packaged goods industry try to address shifting demand and shopping behavior, often through deal-making and divestitures.Tariffs imposed by Trump's administration have challenged the industry and its profits as key commodities like pulp, which is used to make tissues and diapers, grow more expensive.At the beginning of 2025, Kimberly-Clark stopped making private-label diapers for Costco to focus on more premium brands that command higher margins.In June, the company sold a majority stake in its international tissue business to Brazilian pulp maker Suzano. The resulting joint venture is intended to shield Kimberly-Clark from volatile input costs and help stabilize its margins.Once the deal closes, Kimberly-Clark will own health-care brands like Sudafed and Pepcid, once again pitting the company against rival Procter & Gamble, which has a health-care division that includes Pepto-Bismol and Vicks.But even with Kimberly-Clark's blockbuster acquisition, P&G still dwarfs its rival in both enterprise value and annual revenue. P&G has a market cap of about $350 billion.Similar to Kenvue, other spinoffs have also recently proven to be popular acquisition targets. Last year, candy maker Mars announced plans to buy Kellanova, a snacking-centric spinoff of Kellogg, while Ferrero bought W.K. Kellogg, the cereal stand-alone, this year.",

    "body": "Alex Karp, chief executive officer of Palantir Technologies Inc., speaks during the AIPCon conference in Palo Alto, California, US, on March 13, 2025.David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesPalantir reported quarterly results that topped analysts' estimates and issued better-than-expected guidance for the fourth quarter, attributing much of its strength to artificial intelligence. The stock, which has soared 25-fold in the past three years, initially rose in extended trading before falling about 4%.Here's how the company did compared to LSEG estimates:Earnings per share: 21 cents adjusted vs. 17 cents expectedRevenues: $1.18 billion vs. $1.09 billion expectedPalantir, which builds analytics tools for large companies and government agencies, said it expects revenue of about $1.33 billion for the current period, exceeding the $1.19 billion expected by analysts, according to LSEG.The optimistic guidance comes even as the government shutdown stretches into its second calendar month, and potentially threatens some key contracts. Revenue in Palantir's U.S. government business grew 52% in the quarter from a year ago to $486 million.Government sales, particularly from military agencies, have been central to Palantir's ongoing ascent. Over the years, Palantir has steadily beat out major legacy government contractors, and recently landed a deal worth up to $10 billion contract with the U.S. Army.Palantir has also faced criticism over how its tools are being used by government agencies, including U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.Total revenue in the quarter jumped 63% from $725.5 million a year ago, exceeding $1 billion for the second straight quarter. Net income more than tripled to $475.6 million, or 18 cents per share, from $143.5 million, or 6 cents per share, a year earlier.For the full year, Palantir now expects about $4.4 billion in sales, topping the $4.17 billion forecast by Wall Street. The company also bumped up its full-year free cash flow outlook to between $1.9 billion and $2.1 billion.Palantir's U.S. commercial business more than doubled to $397 million. Total contract value for U.S. commercial deals closed more than quadrupled to $1.31 billion. Over the last few weeks, the company has announced new partnerships with Snowflake, Lumen and Nvidia.Retail investors have helped drive Palantir's skyrocketing stock price to new heights. The shares have surged more than 170% this year, lifting the company's market cap past $490 billion and cementing the company among the most valuable technology names in the world.Analysts have raised concerns about the stock, which trades at an extreme multiple relative to technology behemoths with far more revenue. In a letter to shareholders, CEO Alex Karp called out the \"detractors\" who have been \"left in a kind of deranged and self-destructive befuddlement.\"\"The reality is that Palantir has made it possible for retail investors to achieve rates of return previously limited to the most successful venture capitalists in Palo Alto,\" he wrote. \"And we have done so through authentic and substantive growth.\"In an interview with CNBC's Morgan Brennan on Monday, Karp acknowledged that there's excess in the AI market today and that some companies are eventually going to feel the pain.\"The strong companies are going to get much stronger, and the people pretending they're doing stuff are going to disappear very quickly,\" Karp said.WATCH: D.A.

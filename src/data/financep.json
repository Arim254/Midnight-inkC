    "body": "A Peloton Bike inside a showroom in New York, US, on Wednesday, Nov. 1, 2023. Peloton Interactive Inc. is scheduled to release earnings figures on November 2.Michael Nagle | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesPeloton posted a worse-than-expected holiday quarter on Thursday after shoppers failed to shell out for its new AI-driven product line and turned away from higher subscription prices.The connected fitness company missed Wall Street's estimates on the top and bottom lines and fell short of its own internal sales targets in the three months ended Dec. 31 – typically the strongest for Peloton's hardware revenue. The company said it expects sluggish sales to continue in the current quarter. Peloton forecasts revenue between $605 million and $625 million, below expectations of $638 million, according to LSEG. The weak results, coupled with soft guidance, are the first clues investors have that Peloton's product overhaul may not be the sales driver the company hoped it would be. Peloton's stock dropped as much as 13% in premarket trading following the results.The revamped assortment, which came with AI-powered tracking cameras, speakers, 360-degree swivel screens and hands-free control, was designed to grow sales and bring in new customers. But Peloton's results show demand has been sluggish. While Peloton's top line might be disappointing to investors, the company is still making gains in improving its profitability. Over the holiday quarter, the company generated $81 million in adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, better than the $73 million analysts had expected, according to StreetAccount. After it announced plans to lay off 11% of its staff last week, the company expects to generate between $120 million and $135 million in adjusted EBITDA in the current quarter, better than the $119 million analysts had expected, according to StreetAccount.It raised its full-year adjusted EBITDA guidance to between $450 million and $500 million, up from a prior range of between $425 million and $475 million. That's welcome news to investors because it shows Peloton was able to innovate its product line without draining profitability. Also on Thursday, the company announced CFO Liz Coddington is leaving Peloton to \"pursue an opportunity outside the industry.\" She's staying on through March as the company searches for its next finance chief.Here's how Peloton did in its second fiscal quarter compared with what Wall Street was anticipating, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:Loss per share: 9 cents vs. 6 cents expectedRevenue: $657 million vs. $674 million expectedThe company's net loss for the quarter was $38.8 million, or 9 cents per share, a significant improvement from the $92 million, or 24 cents per share, it lost in the year ago period. Sales fell to $656.5 million, down about 3% from $673.9 million a year earlier.Since Peter Stern took over as Peloton's CEO, he's worked to generate new revenue streams and build on the company's progress of improving its profitability. The revamped product assortment was one of his first big moments as CEO and included new prices for both subscriptions and hardware. Despite higher prices, revenue for both hardware and subscription came in lower than expected, indicating unit sales have been weak. Hardware sales drove $244 million in revenue during the quarter while subscriptions saw $413 million in sales, both below expectations of $253 million and $424 million, respectively, according to StreetAccount. In a statement, Stern focused on the company's profitability improvements and said he's seeing \"positive momentum\" across the business. \"Our second quarter represented the most substantial period of innovation at Peloton since our founding. At the same time, our financial performance demonstrated our continued operational discipline, resulting in 39% year-over-year growth in Adjusted EBITDA and reducing Net Debt by 52% year-over-year, proving we can simultaneously innovate and increase our profitability,\" said Stern. \"Our subscription base is highly committed, our integrated Commercial Business Unit is growing and well-positioned to continue doing so, and Member engagement with Peloton IQ is encouraging.\"",

The role involves accompanying Jassy to most of his meetings to learn more about Amazon's various businesses. Shadow advisors typically go on to assume greater roles inside the company. Jassy served as Amazon founder Jeff Bezos' shadow in the early 2000s, before he went on to be CEO of Amazon Web Services. Jay Marine, a top executive in Amazon's Prime Video streaming unit, was Bezos' shadow in 2013. Agarwal served as Bezos' shadow from 2007 to 2009 before he helped oversee Amazon's international expansion and India business. Mehta replaces Alex Dunlap, a former AWS VP who was appointed Jassy's technical advisor in late 2024, Business Insider reported.

    "body": "watch nowAlphabet's shares were down in premarket trading on Tuesday after the company beat Wall Street's expectations on earnings and revenue, with AI spending projected to increase hugely this year. The Google parent shed 3% in premarket as of 7:28 a.m. ET, after closing nearly 2% lower on Wednesday. After the bell, Alphabet reported $113.83 billion in revenue in the fourth quarter, above the estimated $111.43 billion from analysts polled by LSEG. Its Google Cloud division earned $17.66 billion in revenue versus a forecast of $16.18 billion, according to Street Account. YouTube Advertising earned $11.38 billion in revenue versus the estimated $11.84 billion. The tech giant said it would significantly increase its 2026 capital expenditure to between $175 billion and $185 billion — more than double its 2025 spend. A significant portion of capex spending would go towards investing in AI compute capacity for Google DeepMind.What analysts are sayingBarclays analysts said in a note on Thursday that Infrastructure, DeepMind, and Waymo costs \"weighed on overall Alphabet profitability,\" and will continue to do so in 2026. \"Cloud's growth is astonishing, measured by any metric: revenue, backlog, API tokens inferenced, enterprise adoption of Gemini. These metrics combined with DeepMind's progress on the model side, starts to justify the 100% increase in capex in '26,\" they said. \"The AI story is getting better while Search is accelerating - that's the most important take for GOOG,\" they added.Deutsche Bank analysts said in a note on Thursday that Alphabet has \"stunned the world\" with its huge capex spending plan. \"With tech in a current state of flux, it's not clear whether that's a good or a bad thing,\" they wrote.

    "body": "Pandora, the world's largest jeweler by volume, rose Thursday after the company addressed investor concerns about its reliance on silver. Copenhagen-listed shares rose as much as 7% after it guided for largely flat organic growth in 2026 alongside its quarterly earnings report, and said it would introduce platinum-plated jewelry after the price of silver had more than doubled over the past year. Shares were last seen trading 4.9% higher. \"If you look at our volatility of silver, one of the things that we have to [do] for the company is to decouple that from the silver trading,\" CEO Berta de Pablos-Barbier told CNBC's \"Squawk Box Europe.\"\"Varying our basket from new metals is going to help us, because we will not be so dependent on only one metal, which is today silver,\" she said, adding that about 60% of Pandora's business today was silver. While spot silver was down over 12% early Thursday at around $80 an ounce, it is still up more than 150% from about $30 an ounce a year ago.Analysts have warned that the volatile price of silver was a \"pernicious problem\" for the Danish jeweler. A more pressured consumer has also impacted sales. Jefferies analysts on Tuesday said investors will be hesitant to engage with Pandora given recent silver moves. \"The challenges of the last few months will mean, even in a more normal silver price world, [Pandora] will remain substantially cheaper than even a year ago.\"Pandora stock has fallen around 60% over the past 12 months. Cautious consumersThis year, Pandora expects organic growth to land somewhere between negative 1% and 2%, and a profit (earnings before interest and tax) margin of between 21% and 22%.De Pablos-Barbier, who took up the role as CEO last month, told CNBC that moving to a platinum-plated material and expanding its portfolio would allow the company to keep margins in the 20's. In the fourth quarter, organic growth was 4% as demand in the U.S. market, which accounts for about a third of its business, remained soft.\"The reality is that we are seeing the lowest consumer sentiment since the 60s in that market,\" De Pablos-Barbier said. \"This is nothing I can control, what I can control is what I bring to the brand and how much excitement and new products I can bring to the U.S. consumers, so that they continue to be loyal and they continue to come to our stores.\"Like-for-like growth, which measures sales across comparable stores, was flat in the quarter as well as during the first month of 2026, Pandora said.watch nowIt was also the first quarter of negative like-for-like growth since late 2022 in Pandora's strategically important \"Fuel with More\" segment, which focuses on expanding beyond the traditional charms it's known for into new categories like rings, necklaces and lab-grown diamonds, Citi analysts noted. \"Extreme precious metals inflation has materially reduced earnings visibility,\" the analysts said. \"Near-term confidence is further undermined by a volatile US and European macro backdrop (~80% of sales) and potential signs of brand fatigue and broader jewellery consumption softening.\"The jeweler posted a 6% organic growth for 2025, preannounced in January, down from 13% in the previous year and missing its own guidance of between 7% and 8%.",

    "body": "Cheng Xin | Getty ImagesBitcoin dropped below $70,000 on Thursday amid a broader sell-off of risk assets.It's the first time bitcoin has fallen below $70,000 since November 2024. Bitcoin was last trading at around $69,332 at 7:31 a.m. ET, according to CoinMetrics data. Some market watchers have suggested $70,000 is a key level to watch and a break below that could trigger more falls for bitcoin. James Butterfill, head of research at Coinshares, said $70,000 is a \"key psychological level,\" adding that \"if we fail to hold it, a move toward\" the $60,000 to $65,000 range \"becomes quite likely.\"Stock Chart IconStock chart iconThe price of bitcoin over the last year. The drop follows a broad sell-off in tech stocks in the U.S. on Wednesday which filtered through to cryptocurrencies.Meanwhile, precious metals continue to be volatile with silver plunging again on Thursday and gold under pressure. Liquidations — when traders' positions are automatically sold as bitcoin hits a certain price — continue to weigh on markets. This week, more than $2 billion long and short positions in cryptocurrencies have been liquidated this week as of Thursday, according to data from Coinglass.Bitcoin has been on a steady decline since it hit an all-time high above $126,000 in October. It now sits around 40% off that record high with other cryptocurrencies, including ether and XRP, off by much more. \"[The] straight line bull run that a lot of people expected hasn't really materialized yet. Bitcoin isn't trading on hype anymore, the story has lost a bit of that plot, it is trading on pure liquidity and capital flows,\" Maja Vujinovic, CEO of digital assets at FG Nexus, told CNBC's \"Worldwide Exchange.\"watch nowWhile many in the crypto market have credited large institutional investors with supporting bitcoin's price, it is those same participants who appear to now be selling.\"Institutional demand has reversed materially,\" CryptoQuant said in a report on Wednesday. U.S. exchange-traded funds which purchased 46,000 bitcoin at this time last year, are net sellers in 2026, CryptoQuant said.The report also notes another key figure. \"Bitcoin has broken below its 365-day moving average for the first time since March 2022 and has declined 23% in the 83 days since the breakdown—worse than the early 2022 bear phase,\" CryptoQuant analysts said. A moving average is a technical trading term that refers to the average closing price of an asset over a specified time.This suggests \"potential downside toward the $70K–$60K range,\" CryptoQuant said.",

    "body": "An Amazon Go store in New York, US, on Tuesday, Jan. 27, 2026. Michael Nagle | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesLayoff plans hit their highest January total since the global financial crisis while hiring intentions reached their lowest since the same period, outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas reported Thursday.U.S. employers announced 108,435 layoffs for the month, up 118% from the same period a year ago and 205% from December 2025. The total marked the highest for any January since 2009, while the economy was in the final months of its steepest downturn since the Great Depression.At the same time, companies announced just 5,306 new hires, also the lowest January since 2009, which is when Challenger began tracking such data. The crisis recession officially ended in March 2009.With the recent narrative centering on a no-hire no-fire labor market, the Challenger data suggests that the layoff part of the equation could be stepping up.\"Generally, we see a high number of job cuts in the first quarter, but this is a high total for January,\" said Andy Challenger, workplace expert and chief revenue officer for the firm. \"It means most of these plans were set at the end of 2025, signaling employers are less-than-optimistic about the outlook for 2026.\"To be sure, if employers are stepping up plans to furlough workers, it isn't showing up in official government data. Initial jobless claims for the week ended Jan. 24 totaled just 209,000, with the longer-term trend running near its lowest level in two years. However, some high-profile layoff announcements have countered that trend. Amazon, UPS and Dow Inc. recently have announced sizeable job cuts. Indeed, transportation had the highest level from a sector standpoint in January, due largely to plans from UPS to cut more than 30,000 workers. Technology was second on the back of Amazon's announcement to shed 16,000 mostly corporate-level jobs.Planned hiring dropped 13% from January 2025 and was off 49% from December.Challenger data also can be volatile and not correlated to official statistics. However, filings with the Labor Department in January under Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification regulations indicate more than 100 companies have given notice of significant layoffs.",

    "body": "Ford Motor's F-150 Lightning was the best-selling electric pickup truck in the U.S. last year. Still, Ford dropped it, showing the challenges automakers face in learning what kinds of EVs customers want. Now, companies are pivoting to extended-range electric vehicles, or EREVs. Ford and Stellantis' Ram, as well as newcomer Scout Motors are scheduled to start delivering EREV models through 2027. \"I'll say it's a game changer, even a segment-buster in the pickup world,\" said Douglas Killian, chief vehicle synthesis manager at Ram.An EREV — or REEV, as Ram calls it — is a \"series hybrid.\" On most hybrid vehicles, both the gas-burning engine and battery-powered motors drive the wheels. On a series hybrid, the engine only charges the battery. The battery is much larger than those on most hybrids, leading to longer range. Both the Ram and Scout EREVs are expected to get about 150 miles of EV-only driving before the gas generator kicks on. \"I'm a pickup guy,\" Killian said. \"We appreciate the electric drive experience. ... [But] you may have a need to go somewhere farther. You may want to take the same electric vehi cle on a vacation and not wait for the truck to charge all the time.\"A couple of series hybrid models have been released in America over the past 20 years, such as the Fisker Karma in 2010 and the BMW i3 EV. But American automakers think it's the right move for the U.S. truck market.Part of their enthusiasm comes from the segment booming elsewhere, like in China. In just one year, the number of EREV models worldwide jumped 40%, according to a report by the International Energy Agency, almost entirely due to growth in China. The models seem to be especially popular in places where EV range and charging times may be greater concerns. A McKinsey survey published in early 2025 found that somewhere between 13% to 18% of car buyers in Germany, the UK and the U.S. would consider an EREV over an internal combustion, plug-in hybrid or an EV if given the option. The U.S. had the highest level of interest at 18%, with the biggest share taken away from internal combustion and hybrid vehicles. It might be a way for someone interested in EVs to try out owning a vehicle without having to commit fully, said Paul Hackert, senior expert and associate partner at McKinsey & Company. \"These potential EREV buyers are interested in faster charging, a total longer driving range, being electric without being 100% dependent on having to get their vehicle charged when they're low on battery charge,\" Hackert said. Truck buyers are differentRyan Decker, vice-president of brand and strategy at Scout Motors, a forthcoming pickup and SUV brand backed by Volkswagen, said truck owners are unique and \"have a pickup because they work hard and they play hard.\"Scout has both full-EV and EREV versions of its pickup and SUV models, but so far more than 80% of the customer reservations are for the EREV version, called the Harvester, he said.\"I think for a lot of pickup buyers ... their psychology is EV-only isn't the best powertrain choice for a hard-working vehicle owner and buyer,\" Decker said.Loading up a truck bed can knock down battery range by a quarter and towing can drop it by half, studies have shown. That was part of the reason that Ram dropped plans for a full-size EV pickup, Killian said. Take Ford. The Ford F-150 is the most popular pickup line in America, selling close to a million units in the U.S. The Lightning sold about 90,000 — about 3% of the total.\"You could argue 90,000 units for the whole EV pickup truck market was not a bad start. But that market clearly is a finite market to go with,\" said Itay Michaeli, an auto industry analyst at TD Cowen. \"The fundamental issue with a pure electric pickup trucks is, because of the weight and aerodynamics, you need a very, very large battery to achieve the desired range, particularly if the truck is being used for work.\"Greater market potentialIf you measure range mile for mile, an EREV will have a lower upfront cost than a full EV with comparable range since an EREV has a smaller battery, said Stephanie Valdez Streaty, executive analyst at Cox Automotive.\"The bigger the vehicle, the bigger the battery, the bigger the cost,\" she said.EREVs do have much larger batteries than typical plug-ins, but they come with longer driving ranges. Typical hybrids in the U.S. max out around 40 miles or 50 miles, while the Ram and Scout EREVs promises about 145 miles of range just on EV power alone.\"We have way more all-electric range than a plug-in hybrid that's in the market today,\" Scout's Decker said. \"That's why we're expecting our EV utilization factor, the percentage of customers who will actually drive this in EV-only mode, will be significantly higher than a plug-in hybrid.\"So far, Ram's EREV will be first to market, arriving in late 2026. Scout is beginning production in 2027, in a factory it has been building in South Carolina. Ford has not yet said when it will launch its model. Scout said its EREV will start below $60,000. RAM has not released pricing information yet. Not everyone is diving in. General Motors has no EREV in the U.S., although CEO Mary Barra has said the company is considering adding some kind of plug-in hybrid to its lineup. Rivian CEO RJ Scaringe said on the company's third-quarter earnings call that it has no plans to make an EREV. EREVs also have their critics. European advocacy group Transport & Environment said in a recent report that EREVs have some technical advantages over other types of plug-in hybrids, but can still emit as much pollution as an ordinary gas-burning vehicle. It is also possible to drive it without ever charging it. They could be more costly to build. \"From a manufacturing perspective, with the pure battery, it's simpler, fewer parts,\" Valdez Streaty said. \"When you start adding different things, it just gets more complicated. ... But they'll figure it out and they'll continue to find efficiencies, make it more cost-effective.\"The greater complexity will also require an owner to maintain it more like a gas vehicle, which nullifies a one of the most-cited benefits of EV ownership. But owners have the added safety of a backup plan. \"It's one of these situations where we're all saying, 'What's the catch?'\" Killian said. \"To a customer, there really is not a catch.\"Watch the video to learn more.

    "body": "Larry Fink, Chairman and CEO of BlackRock, speaks during an interview with CNBC on the floor at the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York City, U.S., Jan. 15, 2026.Brendan McDermid | ReutersBlackRock CEO Larry Fink and Reliance Industries Chairman Mukesh Ambani want Indians to invest in the country's equity markets instead of gold.The advice comes at a time when the yellow metal has been witnessing heightened volatility, while Indian stocks have been underperforming with the Nifty 50 down nearly 2% so far this year. A large portion of domestic savings in gold and silver \"are unproductive,\" Ambani said during a fireside chat with Fink on Wednesday, adding that money in the \"stock market is compounding.\" Reliance Industries — India's largest conglomerate — and BlackRock — the world's largest asset manager — partnered to launch mutual funds in India last year. Jio BlackRock Asset Management rolled out its first equity fund in August last year and as of December end, it had assets under management of 31.98 billion rupees ($353 million) across its equity funds. Indians are among the leading buyers of gold in the world, but the country has been seeing increasing financialization of savings, with mutual funds growing in popularity. Stock Chart IconStock chart iconNifty 50 returns so far this yearGlobal consultancy firm Bain & Company estimates retail investor-driven assets of Indian mutual fund industry to grow to 300 trillion rupees ($3.3 trillion) by 2035 from 45 trillion rupees in fiscal year 2025.Indians still hold majority of their assets in gold and real estate — allocating nearly 59% in financial year 2025, according to a report by Bain. The share of physical assets was 66% in financial year 2015.At the event, Fink said that the next 20-25 years will be an \"era of India\" and Indians need to invest in their country's growth through capital markets. India is expected to remain the fastest-growing economy in the world, according to the International Monetary Fund, which has pegged its growth at 6.4% in 2026. In contrast, the IMF projects the world economy to grow by 3.3% in 2026. Major economies like Germany, the U.K and Japan are likely to grow in the low single digits.Fink also shared that based on BlackRock's experience in the U.S., the segment of the population that had invested in growth of America is far \"better off than those who just kept all their money in a bank account\"\"Indian equity market over the next 20 years will double and triple and quadruple,\" Fink told India's The Economic Times in a separate interview, adding that he doesn't see \"gold moving that way.\"Even as foreign investors have been net sellers of Indian equities for over a year, rising domestic participation in Indian equities has haled the markets stay in positive territory.Investment through systematic investment plans, which refer to investing bite-sized sums at regular intervals, tripled to 2.89 trillion rupees ($31.9 billion) in financial year 2025 from 2021, data from the Association of Mutual Funds in India shows.In the last one year, MSCI India Index's dollar return of 2.61%, pale in comparison to 43.67% for the MSCI Emerging Markets Index. However, over the last 5-year period, the India index has delivered nearly twice the returns of the broader emerging market index.",

    "body": "Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff appears at the US-Saudi Investment Forum at the Kennedy Center in Washington on Nov. 19, 2025. Stefani Reynolds | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesBox CEO Aaron Levie says that in the 20-year history of his cloud software vendor, \"this is the most exciting moment we've ever had.\" Wall Street doesn't see it that way. The stock is down 17% in 2026 after starting the year with its steepest monthly drop since 2023. It's gotten caught up in a software swoon, as investors dump shares of companies that they worry will get displaced by the rise of artificial intelligence agents.The WisdomTree Cloud Computing Fund has plummeted about 20% so far in 2026, including a 6.5% drop this week. A number of companies are faring far worse than Box. HubSpot has fallen 39% this year following a 42% slump in 2025. Figma has plunged 40% this year, Atlassian is down 35%, and Shopify has dropped 29%. The generative AI boom, kickstarted by OpenAI's ChatGPT a little over three years ago, has rapidly pushed into the business realm, with new tools that can create apps, websites and other digital products in a matter of seconds or minutes with a few text prompts. Levie describes the \"cognitive dissonance\" happening inside the industry, as companies see the power of the new technology to enhance their products, while also reckoning with the broader outside fear that AI will destroy them. \"It somewhat misunderstands this idea of where companies tend to spend their resources and their time and their energy,\" Levie told CNBC's \"The Exchange\" on Wednesday.He made the case that businesses would much rather pay for products and services from a vendor specializing in back office software or customer relationship management systems than do it themselves and carry all the liabilities that follow. watch nowSalesforce CEO Marc Benioff has made a similar argument, telling CNBC's Jim Cramer in December that \"We've got all the customers' data\" and that Agentforce, which automates sales and customer service workflows, is \"the fastest growing product I have ever seen in the history of Salesforce.\"Bill McDermott, CEO of ServiceNow, said last week, after his company reported healthy quarterly results and guidance, that the market's concerns are misplaced and that his products serve \"as the semantic layer that makes AI ubiquitous in the enterprise.\"Dan Springer, former CEO of DocuSign who now runs legal software startup Ironclad, said ServiceNow's offerings can't be replaced by AI, at least not yet. \"I haven't seen something that's been built that would attack that franchise,\" Springer said. Still, Salesforce and ServiceNow have both lost about a quarter of their value this year. A big catalyst for the accelerating selloff has been advancements at Anthropic, creator of the Claude AI model. On Friday, Anthropic announced new legal, finance and product marketing capabilities for its Claude Cowork productivity tool, and released the plugins under an open-source license, enabling customization.Claude is going head-to-head with OpenAI's GPT models and Google's Gemini, but with a focus on selling subscriptions to large businesses that are looking to deploy AI widely.\"I am in awe of this technology,\" said Celso Pinto, senior director of product at software company The Access Group, in a Monday X post. He said he's used Cowork and the Claude Code software development product to review marketing copy, fix technical issues and produce legal documents.Buying opportunity?The public and private markets have decided that infrastructure companies and the top model developers are the AI winners, while software companies are the likely losers, regardless of how strong their businesses may look today.Earlier this month, Anthropic signed a term sheet for a $10 billion funding round at a $350 billion valuation. OpenAI is reportedly eyeing a valuation at over $800 billion, and Google parent Alphabet has seen its stock soar over 60% in the past year, lifting its market cap to $4 trillion.Software executives aren't the only ones trying to counter the prevailing narrative. A number of tech investors and analysts have said that, on the ground, they're not seeing IT buyers strip out their software solutions. Analysts at Stifel wrote in a report last month about HubSpot that the CRM company's business looks fine.Monday.com celebrates its IPO at the Nasdaq, June 10, 2021.Source: Nasdaq\"Despite broader fears of AI-related disruption, no partner cited near-term headcount reductions or seat disruption related to AI,\" wrote the analysts, who recommend buying the stock. Cantor analysts covering Monday.com wrote in a note this week that the provider of project management software is a \"profitable grower benefiting from digital and AI collaboration secular growth trends.\" They have a buy rating on the stock and see the 29% drop this year as creating an \"attractive setup.\"Byron Deeter, a longtime cloud software investor at Bessemer Venture Partners, is taking a buy-the-dip approach.\"Chaos creates opportunity!\" Deeter wrote in a post on X on Wednesday. \"A lot of money is about to be made for those who have the conviction to place the right private and public software bets right now.\"Aaron Levie, co-founder and CEO of Box, speaks at the TechCrunch Disrupt conference in San Francisco on Oct. 29, 2025.Kimberly White | TechCrunch | Getty ImagesAt Box, where Deeter was an early investor, the company's 41-year-old co-founder and CEO says that even if investor fears are overblown, software providers have to rapidly embrace AI to stay relevant. \"AI is causing every software company to have to stay on its toes,\" Levie said. \"It is certainly forcing every incumbent to make sure that they're doing more for their customers. I think that's an incredible thing for the market and for IT buyers.\"— CNBC's Ari Levy contributed to this report.WATCH: Software sector loses about 30% of value in three months.

    "body": "People walk along Bank Junction next to the Bank of England in the City of London, the capital's financial district.Vuk Valcic | SOPA Images | Lightrocket | Getty ImagesThe Bank of England kept interest rates on hold at 3.75% at its first meeting of 2026 on Thursday.The central bank's nine-member Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) voted by a narrow 5-4 margin to keep rates on hold. Four members voted to reduce the benchmark interest rate, known as \"Bank Rate,\" by 25 basis points. Economists polled by Reuters had expected the vote to be a clearer cut 7-2 split.The BOE's policymakers last voted narrowly to cut interest rates in December, but economists had expected the central bank to hold rates steady in February, given better-than-expected monthly growth figures and persistent inflation (at 3.4% in December), in the latest data.The BOE said that monetary policy is being set to ensure that the inflation rate \"not only reaches 2% but remains sustainably at that level in the medium term, which involves balancing the risks around achieving this.\" \"On the basis of the current evidence, Bank Rate is likely to be reduced further,\" but it said judgments around further policy easing will become a closer call. \"The extent and timing of further easing in monetary policy will depend on the evolution of the outlook for inflation,\" the statement said, although it added that it expected the inflation rate to \"fall back to around the 2% target from April.\"Pound sterling was trading 0.6% lower against the dollar, at $1.356, following the data.What's next?Now, all eyes are on the timing and pace of expected rate cuts this year. Here's what economists expect:\"The early data covering 2026 hint at stronger demand and stickier inflation than we had expected. In time, fiscal tightening and decelerating pay growth will snuff out excess price pressures, but not as soon as we anticipated before,\" Andrew Wishart, senior U.K. economist at Berenberg, said in emailed comments.Berenberg has pushed back the three 25 basis-point reductions it expects the BOE to make to its key rate in 2026 to begin in the second quarter; \"We now expect the next move at the 30 April meeting,\" Wishart noted.The BOE's last rate cut in December came against a backdrop of lackluster growth, softening labor market data and a decline in inflation but the rate of consumer price rises have since ticked higher, giving the bank pause for thought.Edward Allenby, senior U.K. economist at Oxford Economics, agreed that while the BOE is expected to stand pat on rates in February, more rate cuts are coming.\"The current bout of mild stagflation is likely to keep the committee divided on the timing of these future cuts, encouraging a gradual approach to loosening policy further,\" he noted in emailed analysis.watch now\"We see the end-April meeting as the most likely timing for the next cut,\" Allenby said. \"By then, the MPC should have a clearer view of the pay awards and whether this is further evidence of slack emerging in the economy,\" he said. Dani Stoilova, U.K. and Europe economist at BNP Paribas Markets 360, believes the first rate cut of 2026 could come earlier than April, but could be a standalone trim.\"We continue to expect the next rate cut in March. After that, we think the BOE will deliver a prolonged pause before resuming policy normalisation in early 2027 (we see a terminal rate of 3.00% by mid-2027),\" she said in emailed comments.",

Jonathan Ernst | ReutersThe U.S. on Wednesday unveiled new initiatives to mobilize allies into a preferential trade bloc for critical minerals, including coordinated price floors as Washington works to counter China's dominance in the market vital for technology and defense.The plans were discussed at a \"Critical Minerals Ministerial\" in Washington this week that included representatives from 54 countries, the European Union and senior Trump administration officials. Following the event, Washington announced that it had signed bilateral critical minerals agreements with 11 countries, building on 10 similar pacts inked over the past five months. Negotiations were also completed with an additional 17 nations.The goals of the agreements are to address pricing challenges, spur development, create fairer markets, and expand access to financing in the critical minerals sector. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who hosted the Ministerial, also announced the formation of the \"Forum on Resource Geostrategic Engagement (FORGE),\" on Wednesday, a partnership to coordinate critical mineral policy and projects.\"We have a number of countries that have signed on to that, and many more that we hope will do so... the purpose of FORGE is to foster collaboration and to build a network of partners across the world,\" Rubio said.FORGE will complement an earlier effort between the U.S. and nine partners, known as \"Pax Silica.\" While Pax Silica centers on safeguarding AI-related supply chains, FORGE is designed as a broader platform to coordinate critical mineral policy, pricing and project development.Rubio warned of risks tied to the concentration of critical minerals in \"one country,\" in an apparent reference to China, including geopolitical leverage and potential disruptions from pandemics or instability.watch nowIn recent years, Beijing has wielded its market dominance in the mining and refining of most critical minerals as a geopolitical tool, selectively restricting exports. Rubio also criticized \"unfair practices\" such as state subsidies that have undercut competitors, making projects economically unviable. In separate remarks, Vice President JD Vance said the U.S. aims \"to eliminate that problem of people flooding into our markets with cheap critical minerals to undercut our domestic manufacturers.\"\"We will establish reference prices for critical minerals at each stage of production,\" Vance said. \"For members of the preferential zone, these reference prices will operate as a floor maintained through adjustable tariffs to uphold pricing integrity.\"The developments come amid broader efforts by the Trump Administration to build stronger critical mineral supply chains. On Monday, President Donald Trump unveiled Project Vault, a $12 billion reserve backed by $10 billion from the U.S. Export-Import Bank and $2 billion in private funds, to stabilize prices and support manufacturers. The stockpile will include critical minerals such as rare earths, lithium and copper.",

All of our European colleagues have the same problem,\" Volvo Cars CEO Hakan Samuelsson told CNBC's \"Europe Early Edition\" on Thursday.He added the discontinuation of EV incentives in the U.S. and China were also contributing to \"a very challenging external environment.\"\"But internally we have had very good work done with lowering our costs and securing a positive cash flow, so that I would highlight as the most important positive things that we have reached during the year,\" he added.watch nowShares of Volvo Cars were last seen down 25.5%. A single-session fall of more than 11.2% would reflect the firm's worst trading day ever.Analysts at UBS said that based on Volvo Cars' profit miss, they anticipate 10%-15% downgrades to full-year 2026 consensus earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT), \"possibly more given the underlying EBIT margin was close to 0%\" in the final three months of 2025.A tough year aheadThe U.S. and EU agreed to a framework trade deal in July last year, one which saw the Trump administration impose a blanket tariff of 15% on most EU goods, a significant reduction from Trump's threat of 30% and almost halving the tariff rate on Europe's auto sector from 27.5%.Industry groups, which tentatively welcomed the trade deal at the time, expressed deep concern about the costs associated with the new tariffs.Volvo Cars has long been considered one of the most exposed European carmakers to U.S. tariffs.Looking ahead, Volvo Cars said deliveries of its new and fully electric EX60 mid-size SUV will ramp up during the second half of the year. However, it warned 2026 is likely to be another challenging one, with continued pricing pressure, tariff effects, regulatory uncertainty and softer consumer sentiment likely to weigh on the industry.",

    "body": "Momo Productions | Stone | Getty ImagesStudent debt can make it more challenging to prepare for retirement — and that is reflected in the retirement balances of older borrowers, Fidelity data shows. Retirement balances are roughly 30% lower among employees over age 50 who currently have student debt, at an average of $153,000, compared to $221,000 for savers in that age group who do not have such loans, the financial services company wrote in a report published Wednesday.  Workers ages 18 to 49 with student loans have nest eggs about 20% smaller than those of their debt-free counterparts, with an average balance of $58,000 versus $72,000. Fidelity analyzed internal retirement account data, including that of borrowers enrolled in its student debt benefits programs.\"Student debt casts a long shadow,\" said Jesse Moore, head of student debt at Fidelity. \"It doesn't fade with age or career advancement. It's a structural issue that shapes financial security at every stage of life.\"Read more CNBC personal finance coverageMillions may drop ACA coverage — and raise health insurance costs for everyone elseRetirement savings 'lost and found' helps retirees track down old 401(k)sBigger SALT cap may 'drive higher refunds,' tax expert says — who benefitsWhat new Medicaid, SNAP work requirements mean for older workersTrump accounts could grow to $50,000 or more, president says.

That leaves them with less time and money to grow their savings. Even later in their careers, student loan holders aren't catching up.Around 9.5 million Americans over 50 carry education debt, and their average balance is about $47,000, according to an analysis by higher education expert Mark Kantrowitz. \"Every dollar people spend on repaying debt is a dollar less they have available to save for retirement,\" Kantrowitz said. Retiring with student loan debt can have ripple effects, a separate poll from Fidelity found. A third of baby boomers surveyed said they delayed travel because of their student loans, while 16% put off purchasing a house and 8% had postponed starting a business. In October, the firm polled 747 U.S. adults who are currently paying back their student loans.Longer repayment terms could set borrowers backRecent legislative changes from President Donald Trump's \"big beautiful bill\" may only worsen the problems for older student loan borrowers, consumer advocates said.Currently, student loan repayment plans typically range from 10 to 25 years — which already results in people bringing education debt into middle age and beyond. But, starting in July, borrowers could face repayment terms as long as 30 years. \"This approach will perpetuate a cycle of indebtedness,\" said Carolina Rodriguez, director of the Education Debt Consumer Assistance Program in New York. \"Borrowers struggling with their own debt will be unable to save for retirement or for their children's education, inevitably leading to more borrowing.\" ",

    "body": "Silver bars are stacked in the safe deposit boxes room of the Pro Aurum gold house in Munich, Germany, Jan. 10, 2025.Angelika Warmuth | ReutersSilver prices slid as much as 16% on Thursday, snapping a two-day rebound, as the white metal continues to reel from excessive volatility.Spot silver prices were trading amost 11% lower at 6:38 a.m. ET, at around $78.38 per ounce, while futures in New York were around 7% lower at $79 per ounce. Meanwhile, spot gold declined around 1.7% to $4,878 per ounce, while futures were down 0.8% at $4,909. Silver had been on a record-breaking spree before crashing almost 30% last Friday. In 2025, it gained about 146%, data from LSEG showed.Analysts point to speculative flows, leveraged positioning and options-driven trading, rather than physical demand, as key drivers of the recent price swings.\"You'd seen a lot of speculator positions build up ... I don't think it's been fully flushed out,\" said Sunil Garg, managing director of Lighthouse Canton.While Garg says the fundamental case for silver demand still holds, he advises to wait a bit more for the speculative positions to get \"wiped out\" first. Silver has a wide range of industrial and technological uses, extending from solar power, catalysts and electronics, amongst others.\"The margin requirements being raised by various metals exchanges around the world ... that's just something that's going to kill off some of the speculation,\" said Garg. The CME Group has raised margin requirements following the steep sell-off last Friday.\"As prices fell, dealer hedging flipped from buying into strength to selling into weakness, investor stop-outs were triggered, and losses cascaded through the system,\" Goldman Sachs said in a note on Wednesday. Stock Chart IconStock chart iconSilver prices in the past one yearSilver's correction has been larger than gold's due to tighter liquidity conditions in the London market, which magnified price swings.Goldman added that the timing of the volatility suggested Western flows, rather than Chinese speculation, are behind much of the build-up and unwind, noting that most of the more violent moves occurred while Chinese futures markets were closed.The volatility in silver prices has drawn growing comparisons to meme stocks such as GameStop, the video-game retailer that became a global phenomenon in 2021 after retail traders on Reddit piled in en masse, sending its shares soaring far beyond what traditional valuation models could justify.Market watchers had warned that prices were detached from sustainable levels, turning the silver trade increasingly meme-like.The precious metals theme captured the public attention and led to \"momentum trading that exceeded even the type of outsized moves that we have seen in a wide range of speculative assets,\" said Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers.",

    "body": "Andy Hill is coasting.The 44-year-old and his wife have built up a net worth north of $1 million, and for now, neither plans to add another dollar to their long-term investments. Instead, they'll let their money to continue to grow, secure in the knowledge that they'll have enough to retire by the time they get there. The strategy is known as \"Coast FIRE,\" a variation on a movement short for \"financial independence, retire early.\" In the early days of FIRE, many of its adherents pursued a straightforward objective: sock enough money away in investments to be able to leave your job and live off of distributions from your portfolio indefinitely. In 2016, shortly after Hill began a side gig hosting the \"Marriage Kids and Money\" podcast, he began to do exactly that, insisting that he and his wife save as much as they could in order to retire as quickly as possible. The resulting friction over money landed them in couples therapy, Hill says. Hill emerged with a new outlook on managing money as a couple — a philosophy he shares in his new book, \"Own Your Time: 10 Financial Steps to Put Your Family First and Escape the Corporate Grind.\" The goal, he tells readers and clients of his financial coaching business, isn't to get to the retirement finish line as soon as possible, but to secure your future while creating the freedom to spend on the things you value now. How to pursue time freedom as a coupleThat process, Hill says, with starts with encouraging couples to dream together rather than diving straight into numbers. \"Really most of the time should be spent on, what do I want out of my life? What do I desire for my dream life?\" Hill says. To narrow in on the answer, Hill urges couples to ask themselves some big questions, such as:If I got a $5 million check in my mailbox tomorrow, and I didn't have to worry about money anymore, what would I stop doing immediately?What am I constantly worried about, and what can I do with my money to help me eliminate those worries?Getting to the bottom of these questions as a couple can give you a roadmap of where to put your money first, says Hill. If your biggest worry is losing your job and losing your home, for instance, you might focus your joint financial energies on paying down your mortgage, he says. If your biggest dream with a windfall is guilt-free travel, you might prioritize building a vacation fund.\"It's about starting from that position of dreaming and then sharing those dreams with your spouse, asking them to do the same, so that you can come together for some cool family goals that work for both of you,\" Hill says.For Hill, and for many of the couples he works with, the ultimate goal is what he calls \"time freedom.\" After putting enough money in your investment accounts to \"coast\" to retirement — an amount that requires some future projection that's worth discussing with a financial professional — you can use money you would have been socking away to enrich your life, either by spending more on things you want or by effectively buying back your time. \"Do we want to inflate our lifestyle and just have more fun, or do we both want to work less?\" Hill says.Hill and his wife have taken the latter approach, using their financial flexibility to scale back at work. Hill's wife left a job in marketing to return to school and now works part-time as an esthetician. Hill went into business for himself full-time in 2019. \"The year I left my corporate career, I was making around $180,000 per year working 40 to 50 hours per week,\" he says. \"This year, I'm paying myself $100,000 working 20 to 25 hours per week.\"Couples with this kind of extra time can use it to be more present parents and partners, focus on their health, care for aging parents and devote more time to hobbies and passions, Hill says. \"There's so many other things that you can do with your life besides working,\" he says.Want to improve your communication, confidence and success at work?

    "body": "Bitcoin dipped below $65,000 on Monday as investors weighed mounting tariff uncertainties and geopolitical concerns. The token traded as low as $64,830 early as it continued a nearly 5% slide that began a day earlier. Over the weekend, that decline brought the digital asset to $64,324 at its nadir, marking its lowest level since Feb. 6 when it hit $60,062. Bitcoin was last down more than 2% at $65,836.68 at 9:40 a.m. ET. Stock Chart IconStock chart iconBitcoin YTDThe world's oldest cryptocurrency has taken a dive, particularly as geopolitical and macroeconomic uncertainties spark investors' flight from risk-on investments. Last week, U.S. President Donald Trump said he would decide whether to strike Iran \"over the next probably 10 days\" due to its resistance toward a new nuclear deal. The tensions seemed to build over the past few days, with the U.S. continuing to position its military forces across the Middle East. Separately, Trump said Saturday in a social media post that he would raise his so-called retaliatory tariffs against many of the U.S.' foreign trading partners to 15%, \"effective immediately,\" just one day after the Supreme Court struck down his previous trade taxes. Since the beginning of the year, Bitcoin has lost 24% due to the onslaught of macro threats, while risk-off assets like precious metals have surged. Gold has gained about 20% in the year to date, while silver has added 23% during the same period. ",

    "body": "Reese Witherspoon has some career advice you might not want to hear.The \"Legally Blonde\" and \"Big Little lies\" actress posted an Instagram video on Feb. 17 offering a tip in response to a young woman she'd spoken with who was unhappy in her job and looking to switch roles.\"Okay, well what are your talents?\" Witherspoon said she asked the woman, who struggled to name her specific talents.\"Everybody has dreams. Doesn't mean you're going to be that thing. You are supposed to do what you're talented at,\" Witherspoon said. \"It's your job in life to figure out what your specific, unique talents are and go chase them. That's what you're going to do,\" she added. \"You don't chase your dreams, you chase your talents.\"Witherspoon's advice might sound unconventional — and she didn't explain her reasoning. But leadership coach and \"The Ambition Trap\" author Amina AlTai likewise says it's bad advice to follow your passion. \"Passion by nature is fickle\" and building your career around it \"positions us to fizzle out fast,\" she told CNBC Make It in December.\"Allow yourself to be passionate about things, and allow those passions to change without feeling the impulse to anchor it to your entire purpose, because it is so changeable,\" AlTai said.NYU Stern School of Business professor, researcher and author Suzy Welch says it's important to identify your aptitudes, or \"the inborn faculties that make us good or better at certain skills, competencies, and areas of expertise.\"The methodology she teaches and writes about in her book, \"Becoming You: The Proven Method for Crafting Your Authentic Life and Career,\" is all about finding your \"area of transcendence\" at the intersection of your values, aptitudes and economically viable interests. Dreams — probably interests with a hint of values in Welch's terms — aren't enough. The right career path is also aligned with your values and financially feasible, according to Welch. And you need to know what you're good at. Aptitudes \"unlock the work we should be doing and the life we should be living so that we can thrive and flourish,\" in Welch's words.Though you might think these would be obvious, \"identifying your aptitudes almost always does take work,\" Welch writes. Various tests exist that can help you identify yours so you can do work you're well-suited to and avoid the \"aptitude-misalignment-hellscape,\" as she calls it. Because \"an aptitude fit can make or break the deal, and your heart.\"Witherspoon's fellow actress Tracee Ellis Ross has shared similar sentiments around pursuing your dreams, emphasizing that you need to consider the effort required in addition to the talents.\"People always say dream big, but what I learned in my childhood was dream big but know that you're the one that's gonna be doing the work,\" Ross said on an episode of Emma Grede's \"Aspire\" podcast in October. \"Dream at a pace and in a way that you can actually maintain what it takes to do that.\"Want to improve your communication, confidence and success at work?

    "body": "An Eli Lilly & Co. Zepbound injection pen arranged in the Brooklyn borough of New York on March 28, 2024.Shelby Knowles | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesEli Lilly on Monday launched a new form of its blockbuster obesity drug, Zepbound, that offers a month's worth of doses in a single pen.Cash-paying patients can get the multi-dose device, called KwikPen, on the company's direct-to-consumer website, LillyDirect. Prices start at $299 per month for the lowest dose level. The pen could serve as a more convenient option for some patients, as it reduces the number of devices they have to use in a month to take the drug. Patients can use one pen to take four weekly doses of Zepbound. Currently, patients on the treatment use a different single-dose auto-injector device each week. Lilly also offers single-dose vials of Zepbound, which require users to draw the medication into a syringe and inject themselves. The announcement comes as Lilly works to sustain the early success of Zepbound, which has exploded in demand since it first entered the market in late 2023. LillyDirect has been key to Zepbound's growth, and rolling out a new form of the drug on the platform could attract even more patients. More CNBC health coverageThe Trump administration is changing Covid, childhood vaccine recommendations – here's what it means for youU.S. to impose 100% tariff on branded, patented drugs unless firms build plants locally, Trump saysEli Lilly to build $6.5 billion Texas manufacturing facility for obesity pill, other drugsThe torrid growth of Zepbound has helped Eli Lilly seize a majority share of the weight loss drug market from rival Novo Nordisk. In the company's fourth quarter, Zepbound brought in $4.2 billion in U.S. revenue, a 122% spike from the previous year. In a release, Lilly said the Food and Drug Administration approved a label expansion for Zepbound to include the multi-dose device.The KwikPen is already used for other drugs, such as Lilly's popular diabetes medication, Mounjaro. \"As part of our commitment to supporting people living with obesity in their weight management journey, we are introducing a new option with the Zepbound KwikPen, a device trusted by patients globally and in the United States for other Lilly medicines,\" said Ilya Yuffa, president of Lilly USA and Global Customer Capabilities, in the release. ",

    "body": "European startup IQM is aiming to build powerful quantum computers to rival the likes of Google and IBM.IQMFinland-based quantum computing startup IQM announced plans Monday to become one of Europe's first publicly listed companies in the sector.IQM will merge with special purpose acquisition company (SPAC), Real Asset Acquisition Corp as part of the listing in New York. The deal, which gives IQM an initial equity valuation of $1.8 billion, is pending shareholders' approval and other regulatory conditions being met, the firm said in a Monday statement.The company is eyeing the transaction being completed around June this year, with the listing to happen shortly after that. It's also considering a dual listing on the Helsinki stock exchange.Founded in 2018, IQM raised $320 million in a Series B funding round in September, which valued the company at $1 billion. The round was led by Ten Eleven Ventures, a U.S. cybersecurity-focused investment firm, while Finnish venture capital firm Tesi also invested.IQM is building full-stack, open-architecture quantum systems that can be deployed on-premise or accessed via the cloud.The merger could provide over $300 million in funding for the company, in the form of private investment in public equity financing and cash held in RAAQ's trust account, assuming no redemptions (when investors in the SPAC withdraw their money from the transaction ahead of the listing). Commercial deploymentQuantum computing promises to run calculations vastly quicker than classical computers can, solving more complex problems and processing larger volumes of data. Proponents of the technology say it could be used to facilitate breakthroughs in areas like medicine, science and finance. While the tech is not yet deployed in commercial environments and still has significant technical obstacles to overcome to become viable, some analysts are particularly bullish on the quantum sector.\"Whilst progress has been slow and there have been many challenges, we are starting to see meaningful breakthroughs in the quantum space,\" UBS analysts wrote in a report in January.\"Quantum computing is a science project no more,\" Jan Goetz, cofounder and CEO at IQM, said. \"It is an industry where customers own, operate and build on advanced quantum computers.\"IQM has sold 21 quantum systems to 13 customers to date, the company said. It made at least $35 million in unaudited revenue in 2025. As some businesses eye commercial deployment of quantum computers by the end of the decade, discussions have begun about how they will integrate with the data center sector.IQM is one of a number of European players in the quantum computing space. U.K.-based Quantinuum raised $800 million across two rounds last year, with Spain's Multiverse Computing picking up 189 million euros in a Series B last year.China is leading in terms of public investment in the sector. The country has funnelled just short of $18 billion in public investment in quantum technology, followed closely by the EU, according to the European Centre for International Political Economy (ECIPE), a think tank.",

In an announcement, the Peace Corps said that the AI solutions the new group implements would be put towards \"real-world grassroots problems\" in key sectors, including agriculture, education, health, and economic development.Volunteers would be sent to countries participating in the American AI Exports Program, announced in July under a Trump administration executive order aimed at maintaining U.S. dominance in advanced technologies globally. The executive order aligns with broader U.S. efforts to counter the influence of Chinese technologies globally, including in developing nations.Chinese firms have gained traction in some developing nations by offering open-source or open-weight models that are inexpensive, highly customizable, and able to run on local infrastructure — including Qwen3 and Deepseek.AI sovereigntyWhile a full list of countries taking part in the AI Exports Program remains unclear, India is expected to be among them, with the Commerce Department welcoming its participation last week.  That statement had come ahead of the inaugural India AI Impact Summit 2026 in New Delhi, where Michael Kratsios, director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, first announced the Tech Corps. India is also joining the U.S.-led Pax Silica initiative — a Trump administration effort aimed at securing the global supply chain for silicon-based technologies —  alongside Japan, South Korea, Singapore, the Netherlands, Israel, the United Kingdom, Australia, Qatar and the UAE as core members.At the summit, Kratsios argued that expanding access to U.S. AI technologies was central to closing the gap in global AI adoption between developed and developing economies. \"Real AI sovereignty means owning and using best-in-class technology for the benefit of your people,\" he said. AI sovereignty — which was a major topic at the Indian AI conference — refers to a country's ability to develop, control and govern artificial intelligence systems within its own legal, economic and strategic framework.The summit saw a number of American tech companies announce major investments in India's AI infrastructure, building on the billions announced last year, aligning with the goals of the Tech Corps. \"AI is the future, and as the undisputed world leader in AI technology, the United States, through the Tech Corps, will be at the forefront of delivering these benefits,\" said Richard E. Swarttz, acting Peace Corps director.Tech Corps volunteers will serve abroad for 12 to 27 months or participate in virtual service placements, with on-ground deployments expected to begin in fall 2026. As with the Peace Corps, volunteers will receive housing, healthcare, a living stipend, and service awards upon completion.In addition to the Tech Corps, the White House also announced other initiatives during the India AI summit, including a National Champions Initiative to integrate leading foreign AI companies into customized American AI export stacks. \"We recognize that partners need the chance to build their native technology industries, and believe facilitating this will be a critical part of the exports program,\" the White House said. It also announced new initiatives to help partner countries \"overcome financing obstacles as they import the American AI stack,\" through other soft-power institutions such as the World Bank and the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation.",

    "body": "Sam Altman, chief executive officer of OpenAI Inc., at the AI Impact Summit in New Delhi, India, on Thursday, Feb. 19, 2026. Prakash Singh | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesOpenAI CEO Sam Altman on Friday defended the resource demands of artificial intelligence, calling concerns about data centers' water use \"fake\" and comparing the energy used by AI systems to that of humans.Altman was speaking on the sidelines of the India AI Impact summit in an interview with The Indian Express when he was asked to address common criticisms of AI, such as its energy and water consumption. The CEO responded that claims circulating online that ChatGPT uses gallons of water per query were  \"completely untrue, totally insane,\" and have \"no connection to reality.\" Data centers traditionally use large amounts of water to cool electrical components and prevent overheating. While data center cooling technologies have promised reduced consumption, some newer data centers no longer rely on water at all.Still, even with improving efficiency, a report last month from water technology company Xylem and Global Water Intelligence projected that the water drawn for cooling would more than triple over the next 25 years as computing demand rises, putting pressure on water systems.While dismissing fears about water use, Altman said energy consumption remains a fair AI concern. \"Not per query, but in total – because the world is using so much AI ... and we need to move towards nuclear or wind and solar very quickly,\" he said. Asked about previous comments from Microsoft founder Bill Gates — who has suggested that the efficiency of the human brain proves that AI can evolve to also become more energy efficient over time —Altman pushed back.\"One of the things that is always unfair in this comparison is people talk about how much energy it takes to train an AI model ... But it also takes a lot of energy to train a human,\" he said. \"It takes like 20 years of life, and all the food you eat before that time, before you get smart.\" \"The fair comparison is if you ask ChatGPT a question, how much energy does it take once a model is trained to answer that question, versus a human, and probably AI has already caught up on an energy efficiency basis, measured that way,\" he added. The process Altman is referencing is known as inference, which refers to the use of AI models that have already been trained to create new outputs. AI inference is typically much less power-intensive than the training itself. Altman's comments, particularly the AI-to-human comparison, have since sparked some debate online amid growing anxiety about AI's ability to replace human work.Sridhar Vembu, co-founder and chief scientist of Indian software company Zoho Corporation, who was present at the summit, criticized the human-AI equivalence. \"I do not want to see a world where we equate a piece of technology to a human being,\" the billionaire said in an X post. The debate comes as governments and companies pour billions into new data centers to support the computing needs of AI systems.According to a May report by the International Monetary Fund, electricity consumption by the world's data centers in 2023 had already reached levels comparable to Germany or France, soon after the launch of OpenAI's groundbreaking ChatGPT AI model.In response, some governments have been working to speed up approval processes to bring new and cheap energy online, with some environmentalists warning such moves could clash with global net-zero goals.Some local communities in countries like the U.S. have also pushed back on development projects over fears they will strain electricity grids and raise overall electricity costs. Last week, the City Council in San Marcos, Texas, voted down a proposed $1.5 billion data center project after months of public opposition. Amid such pushback, many tech leaders, including OpenAI's Altman, have argued data centers will require more energy production from diverse sources, including renewable and nuclear energy.",

The president maintains a residence at Mar-a-Lago, and frequently dines and hosts events at the Palm Beach club.The man was shot by Secret Service agents and a Palm Beach County Sheriff deputy at around 1:30 a.m. ET after entering the secure perimeter around Mar-a-Lago near its north gate and then raising the shotgun at an officer, authorities said.The man who was shot has been identified as 21-year-old Austin Tucker Martin of North Carolina, according to an FBI statement on Sunday. Palm Beach County Sheriff Rick Bradshaw told reporters at a press conference on Sunday that \"a deputy and two Secret Service agents on the detail went to that area to investigate.\"\"They confronted a white male [who] was carrying a gas can and a shotgun,\" Bradshaw said. \"He was ordered to drop those two pieces of equipment that he had with him, at which time he put down the gas can, raised the shotgun to a shooting position.\"\"At that point in time, the deputy and the two Secret Service agents fired their weapons and neutralized the threat,\" Bradshaw said.The FBI is investigating the incident.\"Secret Service acted quickly and decisively to neutralize a crazy person, armed with a gun and a gas canister, who intruded President Trump's home,\" White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a post on X.She also knocked Democrats over the partial government shutdown, which impacted the Department of Homeland Security, which houses the Secret Service. \"It's shameful and reckless that Democrats have chosen to shut down their Department,\" Leavitt said. DHS has been shuttered for more than a week. Democrats are demanding changes to how the department conducts immigration enforcement operations before agreeing to fund the agency, after two U.S. citizens were shot and killed by federal agents in Minneapolis. Trump narrowly avoided assassination in July 2024 when a gunman shot at him from a roof overlooking a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania. A Secret Service sniper killed the gunman, Thomas Matthew Crooks.Two months after that attempt, another would-be assassin, Ryan Routh, was arrested less than an hour after a Secret Service agent fired at Routh as he lay in wait with a rifle outside a golf course where Trump was playing.Routh was convicted of trying to kill Trump. He was recently sentenced to life in prison. ",

    "body": "A drone view shows the Netflix logo on one of the company's buildings in the Hollywood neighborhood in Los Angeles, California, U.S., Jan. 20, 2026.Daniel Cole | ReutersPresident Donald Trump late Saturday called on Netflix to fire board member Susan Rice or \"pay the consequences,\" after she said Democrats would push for corporate accountability if they regain power in the November midterm elections.In a Truth Social post on Saturday, Trump described Rice, who served as President Joe Biden's domestic policy chief and held top foreign policy posts under President Barack Obama, as \"purely a political hack\" with \"no talent or skills.\"\"HER POWER IS GONE, AND WILL NEVER BE BACK,\" Trump wrote. Rice argued during a podcast last week that \"it is not going to end well\" for corporations, news organizations, and law firms that \"bent the knee\" to Trump, and that their deference is unpopular.\"There is likely to be a swing in the other direction, and they are going to be caught with more than their pants down,\" Rice told Preet Bharara, a former U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York. \"They're going to be held accountable by those who come in opposition to Trump and win at the ballot box.\" She added, \"If these corporations think that Democrats, when they come back in power, are going to play by the old rules, and say, 'Never mind, we will forgive you for all the people you fired and all the policies and principles you violated, all the laws you skirted,' I think they got another thing coming.\"Rice served on Netflix's board from 2018 to 2021, and rejoined in 2023 after leaving the Biden administration. Former National Security Advisor and U.S. Ambassador to UN Susan Rice, speaks on stage at the Women In The World Summit in New York, April 11, 2019.Brendan McDermid | ReutersA Netflix spokesperson declined to comment on Trump's remarks, and the White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Trump included a screenshot of an earlier post from far-right activist and Trump ally Laura Loomer, who said Rice's remarks were \"anti-American\" and urged the president to \"kill the Netflix-Warner Bros. merger now.\" Loomer also tagged Federal Communications Commission Chairman Brendan Carr in her post.The comments come after Trump told NBC News earlier this month that the Department of Justice will \"handle\" the deal and that he'll stay out of their review, after previously saying he'd be involved in the process. The DOJ is currently reviewing Netflix's proposed acquisition of Warner Bros. Discovery.Netflix has proposed acquiring WBD in a $72 billion deal that would not include the company's cable networks, including CNN. Paramount Skydance, in response, launched a hostile takeover bid for all of WBD, promising its shareholders $30 per share in an all-cash deal. The DOJ is investigating whether Netflix's proposed deal could hurt competition, and it's also asked how the company's previous acquisitions have affected competition for creative talent, The Wall Street Journal reported earlier this month.As part of its review, the agency is also examining whether the streaming giant uses anticompetitive tactics in negotiations with independent content creators for acquiring programming, Bloomberg reported, citing documents.  Steve Sunshine, Netflix's outside counsel and the head of the global antitrust group at Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom, told CNBC in a statement that the law firm hasn't been given any notice that the DOJ is conducting a monopolization investigation. Netflix's Chief Legal Officer, David Hyman, said in a statement that the company operates in an \"extremely competitive market.\" \"Any claim that it is a monopolist, or seeking to monopolize, is unfounded,\" Hyman said. \"We neither hold monopoly power nor engage in exclusionary conduct and we'll gladly cooperate, as we always do, with regulators on any concerns they may have.\"Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos said last month that he's confident the company will be able to secure regulatory approval \"because this deal is pro-consumer ... pro-innovation, pro-worker.\"watch now",

    "body": "Aalyria CTO and founder Brian BarrittCourtesy AalyriaIn 2022, Google spun out a project focused on high-speed communications networks into a startup called Aalyria. Less than four years later, Aalyria is being valued by investors at $1.3 billion in a new funding round, reflecting soaring demand for reliable, speedy telecommunications. Aalyria's software helps networks deliver better service across land, at sea and in space. Its $100 million in fresh funding lands as the U.S. government bolsters its spending on defense technology and national security satellites, and as the Trump administration seeks to outpace China. SpaceX's Starlink has been snapping up government contracts, and gaining popularity with consumers, especially in areas that aren't well served by traditional high-speed internet. Rivals like Eutelsat, Amazon and others are investing heavily in their own services.Google is retaining a stake in Aalyria. Battery Ventures led the new funding round, joined by firms including J2 Ventures and DYNE.Michael Brown, a general partner at Battery, said SpaceX's success in commercializing lower earth orbit satellites with Starlink has \"stoked competitive fears of satellite vendors.\" In the early days of Russia's war on Ukraine, after SpaceX turned off Starlink over Crimea, the U.S. and European countries sought greater diversity among service providers.\"They love Starlink but want alternatives, too,\" Brown said. \"This is where Aalyria comes into play. When you have a diversity of satellite platforms, including in lower and mid-earth orbit, the ability to route traffic between them has been nearly impossible. But they provide a seamless networking layer.\"Aalyria has already locked in contracts or research funding from partners, including Telesat, the U.S. Air Force, NASA, the Defense Department's Defense Innovation Unit, the European Space Agency and other government offices.watch nowWhen a natural disaster takes out cell towers on the ground, Aalyria's Spacetime software allows a satellite communications network to move to cover the effected location within seconds rather than days, according to founder and technology chief Brian Barritt. In space, the company's software directs satellites in a constellation to automatically reconfigure to fill gaps that occur when others are degraded for any reason.Barritt said one challenge in the market is that companies building space-based networks have so much at stake, and may want to build network orchestration solutions from scratch. It takes time to gain their confidence, he said, but \"once they realize the benefit in being able to have their network operating system federate with others, orchestrate networks of networks, and monetize unused capacity, that tips the scales in our favor.\"Aalyria also sells hardware called Tightbeam, a laser-communication system, that can be affixed to a ship, a plane or other aircraft, enabling it to transmit data over distances longer than 100 kilometers, and at rates comparable to fiber internet cable.The technology behind Aalyria's Spacetime software was developed within Google and used as part of the company's Project Loon, an initiative to use high-altitude balloons to beam internet service to underserved communities. Its Tightbeam systems were also developed at Google and before that at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.Alphabet wound down Project Loon in 2021, opening up an opportunity for Aalyria's founding team to acquire and commercialize the technology. Barritt was previously a senior staff software engineer at Google, with prior experience at Cisco and NASA, while founding CEO Chris Taylor is a national security expert.Taylor brings decades of experience selling technology to the U.S. government and ally nations for civil and military purposes. He locked in the company's first outside funding from investors including Arthur Patterson, co-founder of venture firm Accel Partners.Headquartered in Livermore, California, with offices in Washington D.C., Pittsburgh and London, Aalyria now has about 90 employees, and has attracted talent from Google, Amazon, Meta and NASA. With the fresh funding, Aalyria plans to grow headcount by at least a third over the next year, Taylor said, while also investing in product, engineering and customer support.Battery's Brown said he expects the funding will enable the company to \"get their first constellations launched, operating in space, running Aalyria every minute of every day, and begin capturing additional commercial and government opportunities.\" WATCH: Why the U.S. and SpaceX need each otherwatch now",

    "body": "Hyperscalers are significantly ramping up their AI capex spending — and increasingly using credit markets to fund it.  But investors say this shift is challenging mega-cap tech giants' so-called 'fortress balance sheet' status, and rips up what they call the \"unspoken contract\" that kept speculative AI spending largely separate from debt markets.After Amazon, Meta and Google-owner Alphabet all unveiled sizable increases in their full-year capex spending plans during earnings season, UBS data indicates that aggregated capex spend among AI hyperscalers could top $770 billion in 2026 — some 23% higher than previously expected.In a Feb. 18 note, UBS credit strategists said such increases imply a $40 billion to $50 billion ramp-up in borrowing from hyperscalers, pushing public market debt issuance to between $230 to $240 billion this year.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconOracle.Al Cattermole, fixed income portfolio manager at Mirabaud Asset Management, said this tilt toward the bond market is dramatically shifting the dynamic between hyperscalers and investors.\"For years, we've been told this AI spend would be funded by generated cash flow — that it is equity risk, it is speculative, and not to worry about it from a credit point of view,\" Cattermole told CNBC in an interview.\"There now seems to be a change in the unspoken contract that while we would continue to lend to these businesses, really AI capex was still going to be equity or cash funded….By bringing capex spend into the debt markets, you now have the question of credit worthiness.\"'Break point'Last September, Oracle tapped the bond market for some $18 billion in one of the biggest debt issuances on record. Others have rapidly followed, with Google-owner Alphabet recently issuing some $20 billion in debt, including a rare 100-year sterling-denominated bond. That's placing the sector's debt load under sharper scrutiny.\"Everyone had been treating these AA- or A-rated tech companies as essentially cash-plus. Then, suddenly, to be putting this amount of debt on the balance sheet, that's been quite the turn,\" Cattermole said. \"It's only been three or four months since we've had this turn — everyone's getting used to it in a new way.\"Investors now see trouble up ahead. BlackRock said mega-cap tech companies are using the current credit issuance \"bonanza\" to bridge the gap between current investment and future revenues.\"The problem: rising corporate borrowing adds supply to bond markets struggling to digest large public deficits,\" BlackRock said in its weekly market commentary.watch now\"What has changed is the market's focus: it now asks how AI adoption will translate into revenues and profits. This sorting of winners and losers means it's prime time for active investing,\" BlackRock added.The world's largest asset manager noted that AI builders have largely tapped the U.S. investment grade market, \"so we prefer high yield and European bonds.\"As Oracle's share price has trended lower over the past six months, credit default swaps on its bonds — which offer protection in the event of a borrower being unable to repay its debt — have seen sharp bouts of volatility.Cattermole, meanwhile, pointed to Alphabet's planned capex of almost 50% of its revenue for next year, which he said was approaching an \"unheard-of level.\"\"You wouldn't see that for a normal company at any point in time,\" he added. \"We are very clearly at a break point in natural cycles.\"'Hidden risks'Underlining concerns over a potential debt-fueled AI overspend, investors fear that the huge data centers that are key to the buildout could be rendered obsolete by rapid technical improvements that make chips more efficient and reduce demand for capacity. That carries far-reaching implications for debtholders, according to Cattermole.\"What if, in three years, these Nvidia chips get outstripped by a Chinese competitor, and I'm lending for five or eight years, and in year three, my data center is obsolete?\" he said.Shaan Raithatha, senior economist at Vanguard, said AI hyperscalers are starting from a very strong position, boasting \"strong balance sheets, strong free cash flow generation, and strong moats\" — but he acknowledged that they are now taking on more leverage.\"Are there hidden risks building in the system, whether it's special purpose vehicles, the greater leasing of assets, greater off-balance sheet activity? The hidden risks are building, we don't know if that's ever going to come up,\" Raithatha told CNBC's \"Squawk Box Europe\" on Wednesday.\"But, clearly, investors have to be mindful of that when they start to discount stock market returns into the future.\"—CNBC's Michael Bloom contributed to this report.",

    "body": "The Novo Nordisk A/S headquarters in Bagsvaerd, Denmark, on Wednesday, Nov. 5, 2025. Nichlas Pollier | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesNovo Nordisk stock fell as much as 16% Monday after it said its next-generation weight loss drug didn't meet its key goal of showing that it wasn't inferior to Eli Lilly's rival drug, in the latest blow to the Danish drugmaker, whose stock is trading at a multi-year low after a series of disappointing announcements. The experimental drug, CagriSema, didn't achieve its primary endpoint of demonstrating non-inferiority on weight loss when compared to Eli Lilly's rival drug tirzepatide after 84 weeks, Novo said in a statement Monday morning. Tirzepatide is the active ingredient in Lilly's mega-blockbuster medicines Mounjaro and Zepbound, which have overtaken Novo Nordisk's semaglutide, sold as Ozempic and Wegovy, in U.S. prescriptions. Novo's Copenhagen-listed shares were last seen down 16% at 251 Danish kroner, hitting their lowest level since June 2021. Eli Lilly's stock was up 4.3% in mid-morning trading. Lilly also launched a new form of Zepbound, which offers a month's worth of doses in a single pen on Monday.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconNovo Nordisk ADR's are severely underperforming Eli Lilly shares.Patients taking a 2.4 mg dose of CagriSema achieved a weight loss of 23% after 84 weeks compared to 25.5% with a 15 mg dose of tirzepatide, Novo said.The trial was a so-called open-label trial, meaning participants knew what treatment they were receiving. Such a design can introduce a risk of bias in favor of a well-known product when it is compared to an investigational therapy, Novo's Chief Scientific Officer Martin Holst Lange told CNBC's Charlotte Reed.There were some \"slightly surprising results\" for the market drug, in this case tirzepatide, he added.  Lilly's own studies have shown tirzepatide to result in a 20.2% weight loss over 72 weeks for people living with obesity or overweight. Eli Lilly didn't immediately respond to a CNBC request for comment.Next-generation weight loss drugsNovo filed CagriSema for approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration late last year, and a decision is expected by late 2026. It has high hopes for the drug, which combines semaglutide and cagrilintide, another hormone released in the pancreas that affects appetite. Despite Monday's disappointing results, Novo CEO Mike Doustdar remained upbeat about CagriSema's potential.\"We strongly believe that CagriSema has, right now, the best weight efficacy than any product currently in the market,\" he said. Novo is exploring additional trials to test CagriSema, including higher-dose combinations, the company said. watch now\"CagriSema has the potential to be the first GLP-1/amylin-combination product to reach the market for people living with obesity, documenting that cagrilintide adds to the existing benefits of semaglutide and offers clinically meaningful additive weight loss effects superior to what has been observed with GLP-1 biology alone,\" said Novo's Lange, adding that further trials would \"assess the full weight-loss potential of CagriSema.\"However, the failure of CagiSema to meet non-inferiority versus Zepbound adds further uncertainty, and the drug's commercial positioning is increasingly unclear, said Jefferies analyst Michael Leuchten. CagriSema could account for between 15% and 25% of Novo's revenue by 2030, \"highlighting the pressing need for M&A,\" Leuchten said, forecasting that Novo could spend up to $35 billion on M&A this year.Another blowMonday's trial result is another blow to the Danish drugmaker as it fell short against a drug already on the market, and comes after the stock fell nearly 50% in 2025. Earlier this month, Novo predicted that its sales and profit growth would decline by between 5% and 13% in 2026, as the company navigates competition, lower prices in the U.S., and the loss of exclusivity for  Wegovy and Ozempic in certain markets. \"People should expect that it goes down before it comes back up,\" Novo's Doustdar told CNBC at the time.watch nowMeanwhile, Lilly guided for sales to grow by about 25% in 2026.Novo started the year with a strong launch of the first GLP-1 pill for weight loss in the U.S., the Wegovy pill, but Doustdar said it wasn't enough to offset challenges in other parts of its business. Eli Lilly is expected to launch a rival pill in the second quarter of 2026. On top of competition from Lilly, Novo sales have taken a hit due to competition from compounding pharmacies that sell copycat versions of semaglutide for a lower price, in what Novo has called \"illegal mass compounding that poses a significant risk to patient safety.\"The FDA said earlier this month that it planned to take legal action against telehealth firm Hims & Hers, including restricting access to ingredients and referring it to the Department of Justice, after Hims offered a Wegovy pill copy for significantly cheaper than Novo sells the branded pill for. Hims quickly pulled the pill after the backlash. ",

    "body": "2026 Jeep CherokeeMichael Wayland / CNBCLOS ANGELES – Stellantis is counting on the return of the Jeep Cherokee to help lead a U.S. turnaround for the SUV brand and embattled automaker. The Cherokee returns after a three-year hiatus, rejoining the compact and midsize vehicle markets, which represent the largest segments in the U.S. It also marks Jeep's first traditional hybrid model and its most fuel-efficient, gas-powered vehicle ever in the U.S.\"This is a critical vehicle for us,\" Richard Cox, Jeep senior vice president of brand operations, told CNBC during a media event for the 2026 Cherokee. \"I think this expands our reach with this level of powertrain, with this level of fuel efficiency and capability.\"The vehicle is currently arriving in U.S. dealerships as arguably the most important U.S. launch for the automaker this year. Stellantis is attempting to regain market share after significant losses in recent years. The automaker has set a target to increase retail sales by roughly 25% in 2026 to 1.15 million vehicles, driven by updated and new models as well as pricing and product realignments to move vehicles off dealer lots. \"It's a huge part of our growth,\" Cox said regarding the new Cherokee. \"It positions us well in '26.\" The interior of the 2026 Jeep Cherokee Overland.StellantisLast year, Jeep narrowly reported its first annual sales increase – up less than 1% – since 2018, when the brand achieved sales of more than 973,200 units. That compares with sales of 593,401 Jeeps in 2025, a 39% decline over the seven-year period.The 1% annual sales growth for Jeep wasn't enough to lift Stellantis' overall U.S. sales into the black for the year, though. The parent company reported a 3% decline in U.S. sales in 2025 – marking its seventh consecutive fall amid a failed push into all-electric vehicles and significant cost cutting and price increases under former CEO Carlos Tavares.Sean Hogan, a Los Angeles-area dealer who's leading Stellantis' franchised national dealer council, believes the 25% target increase in U.S. sales is achievable with the company's new leadership and product slate.\"We've been missing Cherokee. It's huge to us. It's huge to Jeep, and I think they nailed it,\" said Hogan, vice president of Sierra Auto Group. \"It's key for us to getting the machine turned back on to start the volume that's going to be flowing again and generate the capacity in our dealerships. It's bringing in new customers.\" Jeep Cherokee is priorityJeep believes it has a winner with the Cherokee, even more so than the last generation of the vehicle that peaked at nearly 240,000 units sold in 2018. The company declined to discuss production expectations, but it likely won't be able to achieve similar sales numbers until the company adds U.S. output capabilities. Plans to expand production at an Illinois plant are expected as early as next year.The Cherokee is currently only being produced at a plant in Toluca, Mexico, that also manufactures a smaller Jeep Compass SUV and Jeep Wagoneer S EV, and is slated to produce the upcoming Jeep Recon EV as soon as the second quarter.Stellantis' Toluca plant is estimated to have the capacity to produce 303,000 vehicles annually, according to AutoForecast Solutions. The auto intelligence and forecasting firm expects Jeep's U.S. sales this year to increase roughly 10% to 650,000 units, led by the Cherokee, according to Sam Fiorani, AFS vice president of global forecasting.Read moreJeep CEO Bob Broderdorf told CNBC in December that Cherokee is the priority for the brand amid slowing EV sales.\"Once Cherokee is done and has a good run rate, then we can start on Recon,\" he said. \"Recon, I'm not in a hurry. I want to get the quality right of Cherokee, and then as soon as we're confident, OK, turn on the Recon.\" Broderdorf has been leading a turnaround strategy for Jeep since being named CEO in February. Those efforts have included significantly reducing prices and model complexity and shifting away from the brand's all-electric plans as part of a broader pullback by Stellantis that will cost the company $26 billion.2026 CherokeeThe 2026 Cherokee is a traditional hybrid – a technology pioneered by the Toyota Prius – that does not require a plug, but does use a small battery and electric motors to assist fuel economy.Jeep has historically been known for its large, boxy gas-guzzling SUVs, but the Cherokee is expected to achieve 37 combined miles per gallon, including 35 mpg on the highway and 39 mpg in the city.2025 Jeep Cherokee SUVStellantis\"Those are very competitive numbers,\" said Mike Cockell, director of Jeep Cherokee nameplate. \"It's a vehicle that must do it all for the customer, and we feel we're able to do it all. It's like a Swiss army knife.\"The updates are an attempt to make the vehicle more competitive against brands such as Toyota as well as to capitalize on expected growth in hybrid vehicles. \"Electrification trends are pretty flat. Hybrid trends are absolutely growing,\" Cox said. \"So, I think it was a big move in the right direction.\"The Cherokee features a 1.6-liter turbocharged, four-cylinder hybrid powertrain rated at 210 horsepower and 230 foot-pounds of torque. It features standard four-wheel drive, relatively large interior screens, and 140 standard and available safety and security features.Starting pricing for the Cherokee ranges from roughly $37,000 to $46,000, according to Stellantis. The bestselling model is expected to be the $39,995 Cherokee Laredo, which Stellantis says is projected to represent 36% of the vehicle's sales.The pricing positions the midsize vehicle to be competitive in its own segment as well as against compact SUVs such as the Toyota RAV4 and Honda CR-V.Jeep officials say those two brands served as benchmarks for the updated Cherokee. 'We have a number of customers that have either defected or they've moved into something else because we didn't have a product offering for them. So, this is our chance to get them back into the family, and I think do some conquesting as well,\" Cox said.",

The objective was to determine whether Harvard continued to \"unlawfully discriminate against applicants for admission on the ground of race,\" according to the complaint. The Justice Department said that Harvard \"slow-walked\" the pace at which it produced the documents requested by the DOJ. \"If Harvard has stopped discriminating, it should happily share the data necessary to prove it,\" Assistant Attorney General Harmeet Dhillon of the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division also said in the press release.The lawsuit itself is a partially strategic move, according to Jamie Beaton, co-founder and CEO of Crimson Education, a college consulting firm. \"Harvard is the wealthiest university with a $56.9 billion endowment,\" Beaton told CNBC. \"There is definitely a scapegoating, both on the side of the government … and, in turn, Harvard feeling that sense of moral responsibility to set precedents that are largely favorable for their peers that don't have as many resources to fight back.\" In a statement emailed to CNBC, Harvard said it \"has been responding to the government's inquiries in good faith and continues to be willing to engage with the government according to the process required by law.\"Since the 2023 Supreme Court ruling found that race-conscious policies discriminated against Asian American applicants, the admissions office doesn't consider, look at or review the racial and ethnic composition of the applying class until the admissions cycle is complete, including waitlists, according to a university spokesperson.Among other measures, Harvard also reinstated standardized testing requirements in 2024 as part of the admissions process, \"which recent research has affirmed is valuable for identifying talent from across the socioeconomic range,\" the spokesperson said.What lawsuit may mean for future Harvard applicantsStill, experts say the Supreme Court's decision was a major setback in efforts to boost enrollment of minorities from marginalized backgrounds through policies that took into account applicants' race.In the admission cycles that followed the ruling, \"Harvard has largely complied,\" Beaton said.\"If you look at the data, there's been a massive growth in the number of Asian Americans getting in,\" he said. For the Class of 2029, Asian American students made up 41% of roughly 2,000 admitted students, up from 29.9% for the Class of 2027, the last class admitted before the ruling on affirmative action. \"When you look at those numbers, it would suggest they don't really have all that much to hide,\" Beaton said.Students walk on campus at Harvard University, in Cambridge, Massachusetts, U.S., Nov. 19, 2025.Reba Saldanha | ReutersBy compelling Harvard to make this admissions data more accessible, \"this lawsuit has broken open the long-secret world of 'holistic admissions,'\" said Christopher Rim, president and CEO of Command Education, a New York-based college consulting firm. \"Asian American students at elite institutions have long suspected that the game was rigged — now, we know that for certain,\" he said. \"However, while this may diminish the university's sheen in the eyes of some, it's unlikely to dramatically change the demand for a Harvard education,\" he added.How the college acceptance landscape is changingAt the nation's most elite colleges, including the Ivy League, applications have only continued to skyrocket, driving acceptance rates near rock bottom. Harvard's acceptance rate was under 4% for the Class of 2029, down from more than 10% two decades ago; similarly, both Princeton and Yale had acceptance rates under 5%, down from 12% and 10%, respectively. Battling with the federal government is unlikely to change that trend, experts say.For students applying to Harvard or other top colleges in the years ahead, \"the general advice is that academics have become an even more important priority than they have been historically,\" Beaton said. \"The bar for academic rigor has gone up,\" he said. \"I would say full steam ahead on the academics and don't blink too much on the lawsuits.\"Subscribe to CNBC on YouTube.",

President Emmanuel Macron and Mrs Brigitte Macron are in the U.K. for the first visit state visit made by France in 17 years. They stayed at Windsor Castle, hosted by King Charles III and Queen Camilla.</p><p>Leon Neal | Getty Images Entertainment | Getty Images</p></div><div><p>The resignation of Prime Minister Sebastien Lecornu has shown that this latest French government crisis is different to the previous ones because, this time, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/07/dj-vu-in-france-as-political-chaos-returns-but-there-is-a-difference.html\">key allies of the government had been instrumental in toppling it, rather than the opposition.</a></p><p>Since then, a wider trend has emerged of allies turning against French President Emmanuel Macron. This has accelerated this week with his own former prime ministers coming out one after the other to criticize the president for his handling of the political deadlock that has gripped the National Assembly.</p><p>The most notable criticism has come from Gabriel Attal, once Macron's protégé, and the youngest ever prime minister when appointed in early in 2024. </p><p>He lost the job just a few months later after Macron decided to call <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2024/07/06/france-elections-2024-rise-of-le-pen-shows-scale-of-polarization.html\">a snap election in June 2024</a>, blindsiding even some of his closest allies, including Attal, who since then has been gradually distancing himself from his mentor. </p><p>Now the leader of Macron's centrist group in parliament, Attal said on television Monday evening that \"like many French, I no longer understand the president's decisions\" adding that the president gives \" the impression of a form of relentlessness, of wanting to keep control.\"</p></div><div><p>France's Prime Minister Gabriel Attal gives a speech following the first results of the second round of France's legislative election at Matignon in Paris on July 7, 2024.</p><p>Ludovic Marin | Afp | Getty Images</p></div><div><p>Then on Tuesday Morning, Edouard Philippe, Macron's very first prime minister during three years of his first term in office, made a shock call for an early presidential election, talking about a \"woeful political game\" and \"a political crisis that worries and dismays our fellow citizens.\"</p><p>He continued, \"we're not going to let what we've been experiencing for the past six months drag on for another 18 months; that's far too long.\" In his view, this crisis, \"is not just a chronicle and a dance of posturing and ambitions, this crisis is a crisis of the state.\"</p><p>On Tuesday evening, it was the turn of Elisabeth Borne. </p><p>Prime minister between May 2022 and January 2024, she came out with what may be both the way to solve the current crisis and the undoing of Macron's legacy: suggesting the possible suspension of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2023/03/16/frances-macron-overrides-parliament-to-pass-pension-reform-bill.html\">the infamous pension reform</a>. </p><p>Borne was in charge of the government during the tough times of the negotiations and protests around the controversial reform to raise the minimum pension age from 62 to 64 years old.</p><p>Despite being adopted a couple of years ago, the reform continues to be a lightening rod for French politics, with both the left and the far-right calling for its amendment, if not its repeal altogether.</p><p>The freezing of the reform could open a potential path for negotiations with the Socialist Party with the aim of avoiding a dissolution of parliament. But the undoing of the totemic reform of Macron's mandates would be highly symbolic. </p><p>Maybe it will be the necessary sacrifice to avoid a deeper crisis and deleterious spiral for French politics and institutions, arguably a much worst legacy for Macron.</p></div></div>",

Purchase demand hasn't moved much in the past few months as potential homebuyers contend with high prices and growing uncertainty in the economy. While the supply of homes for sale is higher than it was a year ago, more sellers are delisting their properties, or choosing to wait before listing.</p><p>For those who are buying or refinancing, somewhat riskier adjustable-rate mortgages are gaining in popularity, as they offer lower interest rates. Rate terms on ARMs can be fixed for up to 10 years, but the loans are considered riskier, as they can adjust higher depending on market conditions when the fixed term expires.</p><p>\"The ARM share increased to 9.5 percent last week from 8.4 percent the prior week. Our survey shows 5/1 ARM rates are averaging almost a percentage point below 30-year fixed rates, and this differential is leading more purchase and refinance applicants to consider ARMs,\" said Fratantoni.</p><p>Mortgage rates haven't done much to start this week, as the absence of government data on the economy, due to the shutdown, has kept bond markets relatively calm.</p></div></div>",

With such high expectations of future earnings growth, any pullback on AI-related bets could lead to ripple effects, it added.</p><p>Investors are closely watching AI-related stocks as earning season gets underway, with <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/06/artificial-intelligence-is-exciting-play-into-earnings-wells-fargo.html\">some strategists confident</a> that tech company valuations are being driven by sound fundamentals.

Meanwhile, political uncertainty in France and Japan persists and questions remain over U.S. President Donald Trump's interference with the Federal Reserve, adding to the Bank of England's more gloomy outlook. </p><p>Changes to the risk landscape \"increases the risk that markets have not fully priced in possible adverse outcomes, and a sudden correction could occur should any of these risks crystallise,\" the Bank of England said. </p><p>As such, it could have a knock-on effect for households and businesses in a market that is already feeling the pinch through high costs of living and borrowing costs, it added.</p></div></div>",

Prime Minister Keir Starmer said, after news of the tariff hike broke, that the government was holding discussions with both the EU and U.S. about steel tariffs.</p><p>Retaliatory measures might not be off the table, with British Industry Minister Chris McDonald noting: \"We continue to explore stronger trade measures to protect U.K. steel producers from unfair behaviors.\"</p><p>He added, however, that \"it's vital we protect trade flows between the U.K. and EU and we will work with our closest allies to address global challenges.</p></div><h2><a></a>Auto backlash</h2><div><p>The EU's announcement has not been well received in all corners of the continent, with the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association (ACEA) saying the measures could threaten the domestic car industry. </p><p>The auto body noted that European carmakers source around 90% of their direct steel purchases in the EU and that they are \"most concerned\" about the inflationary impact the restrictions will have on European market prices.</p><p>\"The dramatic lowering of quotas and the doubling of the out-of-quota tariff to 50%, will significantly reduce the possibility to relieve pressure in the European market through imports,\" the ACEA said in a press release.</p></div><div><p>Employees of German car producer Porsche AG work on a Porsche Taycan electric sports car at the Porsche production site in Stuttgart, southwestern Germany, on September 26, 2022.</p><p>Thomas Kienzle | AFP | Getty Images</p></div><div><p>In addition, it said a new rule of origin based on the \"melt and pour\" principle will further restrict imports and \"create a massive administrative burden for European users of imported steel products.\"</p><p>ACEA Director General Sigrid de Vries said the body recognized the need for some level of protection for the steel sector, but added, \"we feel that the parameters as proposed by the Commission go too far in ring-fencing the European market. We need to find a better balance between the needs of European producers and users of steel in this measure.\"</p></div></div>",

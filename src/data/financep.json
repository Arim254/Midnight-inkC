    "body": "Former President Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton arrive ahead of the 60th inaugural ceremony on Jan. 20, 2025, at the Capitol in Washington.Melina Mara | Via ReutersFormer Secretary of State Hillary Clinton on Thursday challenged Republicans on the House Oversight Committee to take the testimony of her and former President Bill Clinton about sex offender Jeffrey Epstein in public and not in a closed session as those lawmakers plan.Hillary Clinton made the demand after she and Bill Clinton dropped their efforts to resist subpoenas to testify before that committee, whose Republican leadership had threatened a vote on holding them in contempt of Congress if they refused to appear.\"For six months, we engaged Republicans on the Oversight Committee in good faith,\" Hillary Clinton said in a post on X. \"We told them what we know, under oath. They ignored all of it. They moved the goalposts and turned accountability into an exercise in distraction.\"\"So let's stop the games. If you want this fight, @RepJamesComer, let's have it — in public,\" Clinton wrote, naming the panel's chairman. \"You love to talk about transparency. There's nothing more transparent than a public hearing, cameras on.\"House Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer, R-Ky., told reporters on Tuesday that the Clintons would not be \"treated differently than everyone else,\" and said the subpoenas for them called for depositions to be taken by the committee, not for a public hearing.\"If they get through the depositions and they still want a public hearing, we'll try to do something,\" Comer said that day.A spokeswoman for the Oversight Committee, in a statement Thursday to CNBC when asked about Hillary Clinton's X post, said, \"The Clintons are going to Clinton and try to spin the facts since no one is buying their claims. The only ones moving the goalposts are, as usual, the Clintons and their attorneys.\"\"The Clintons were issued bipartisan subpoenas for depositions — not a hearing. Republicans and Democrats on the Oversight Committee voted to recommend the House hold the Clintons in contempt of Congress for defying duly issued subpoenas for six months,\" the statement said.\"In the wake of facing contempt of Congress proceedings, the Clintons' attorney finally agreed to filmed, transcribed depositions on February 26 and 27,\" the spokeswoman said.\"These depositions are in accordance with House and Committee rules. All witnesses appearing for interviews as part of our Epstein investigation are being treated fairly and consistently. The Committee has filmed interviews with all witnesses, including former U.S. Attorney General Bill Barr and U.S. Labor Secretary Alex Acosta — both of whom are Republican witnesses.\"",

India will waive tariffs on industrial imports from four European nations for a $100 billion investment over 15 years, ending nearly 16 years of negotiations.Thierry Monasse | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesNew Delhi is ready to place orders worth up to $80 billion for Boeing planes, India's Commerce and Industry Minister Piyush Goyal reportedly said, signaling New Delhi's willingness to expand trade with the U.S.India's demand for aircraft alone, with orders for Boeing \"yet to be placed but ready,\" is nearly $80 billion, Goyal said on Thursday, adding that if engines and other spare parts are added, imports from U.S. will \"cross 100 billion dollars just [from] aircrafts.\"Families of passengers who died in the Air India plane crash in Ahmedabad in June last year are suing Boeing, over the alleged role of defective dual switches in the disaster that saw 241 of the 242  the minister said on board lose their lives.The minister also said that there was potential to procure a minimum of $500 billion worth of goods from the U.S. over the next five years, but clarified that there was no explicit investment commitment made as part of the trade deal with Washington.On Monday, within a week of the India-EU trade deal, U.S. President Donald Trump announced in a social media post that Washington and New Delhi had agreed a trade deal. Trump said that the U.S. will reduce tariffs on Indian goods to 18%, while New Delhi will lower duties on U.S. goods to zero, replace Russian oil with supply from U.S. and Venezuela, open sensitive markets such as agriculture and buy $500 billion worth of American goods.The Indian Prime minister expressed delight over cut in duties, as goods from the country entering U.S. have been subjected to 50% in tariffs, but did not acknowledge any other details shared by Trump.watch nowWhile experts agree that India will buy more from the U.S., they have said the target of buying goods worth $500 billion from Washington  \"seems a stretch.\"India's overall goods imports stood at $720.24 billion in financial year 2025, with its trade deficit at $94.3 billion. That includes goods worth $45.3 billion from the U.S.Deal timelineIndia and the U.S. will sign a joint statement in the next 3-4 days, finalizing the first tranche of the trade deal between the two countries, Goyal said on Thursday. The 18% tariffs on Indian exports to the U.S. will become effective after the joint statement is issued, he added.Two sides will then sign a formal agreement in mid-March, after which the tariff concession for U.S. goods entering India will become effective.Since the deal has been announced, the Indian government has been scant with details and is facing questions from opposition political parties. The leader of India's opposition, Rahul Gandhi, has accused Modi of being \"compromised\" and of having \"surrendered on Tariffs.The Indian government has not confirmed some of Trump's claims about the trade deal such as India reducing duties on U.S. goods to zero and halting imports of Russian oil, as well as a firm commitment to purchasing goods worth $500 billion.Experts say Trump's claims seem \"unrealistic\" and risk the U.S. backtracking on the trade deal, citing his threats to raise tariffs on South Korea, after slashing them in July last year, despite a trade deal.",

    "body": "Two armed members of Iran's police special forces stand behind a country flag placed on an armored military vehicle during a pro-Government rally in downtown Tehran, Iran, on January 12, 2026. Nurphoto | Nurphoto | Getty ImagesThe U.S. Virtual Embassy in Iran issued a security alert early Friday urging American citizens to \"leave Iran now\" and prepare departure plans that don't rely on U.S. government assistance. The notice comes ahead of U.S. and Iran's scheduled talks in Oman on Friday, with little indication that the two sides have found common ground over the agenda of the meeting.  U.S. Special Envoy Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, U.S. President Donald Trump's son-in-law, were due to take part in the meeting with a team led by Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, according to American and Iranian officials.  The talks on Friday would be the first official meeting between Tehran and Washington since tensions flared in June last year, when a 12-day war with Israel led to U.S. airstrikes that severely damaged Iran’s three main nuclear facilities.  Differences over the scope and venue for the talks have cast doubts on whether they will yield results, keeping open the risk of a U.S. military action.  The U.S. government has reportedly demanded Iran to discard its stockpile of enriched uranium, put limits on Tehran's ballistic missile program and stop arming and funding militant groups in the Middle East. Trump has threatened military strikes against Tehran if it fails to agree to U.S. demands. Iran has pushed back, saying U.S. demands are an unacceptable infringement on its sovereignty and has threatened to respond forcefully to any attacks by striking U.S. military targets in the region and Israel.Little hope?The diplomatic moves come against the backdrop of heightened tensions in the Middle East with the U.S. building up forces in the Gulf in recent weeks. Trump has sent what he called a \"massive armada,\" led by aircraft carrier Abraham Lincoln to the Middle East in the lead up to the talks. The odds for a deal or de-escalation from the talks are low, as the core demands of both sides remain \"far apart and there is zero trust,\" said Bob McNally, president at Rapidan Energy Group. McNally projected a 75% probability that the U.S. and Iran will engage in military hostilities in the coming days, or weeks. Possible scenarios include a Venezuela-style blockade, selective or limited strikes and large-scale military conflict, he said.The talks were originally slated to take place in Istanbul, given Turkey's leading role as a mediator, with foreign ministers from regional Arab countries, including Egypt, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and Turkey, invited to participate.But on Tuesday, Tehran requested a last-minute change of venue and format, asking the meeting to be held in Oman and to limit attendees to Iranian and American representatives. watch nowAs Trump has put U.S. credibility on the line, if Iran refuses to make large concessions, the U.S, president will likely feel compelled to act, McNally said. On the other hand, if the U.S. stands down from attacks, Israel could launch strikes against Iranian missile, nuclear and regime leadership targets.Tensions flared up earlier this year after a nationwide protest broke out in Iran. Tehran clamped down on protests, killing at least 6,883 people as of Wednesday, according to Human Rights Activists News Agency, a Washington-based group focused on Iran. Trump had previously threatened to intervene in support of protestors in the country, but ultimately backed out of taking military action.— CNBC's Asriel Chua contributed to the report. ",

    "body": "The logo of pharmaceutical company Novo Nordisk is displayed in front of its offices in Bagsvaerd, Copenhagen, Denmark, Feb. 4, 2026.Tom Little | ReutersNovo Nordisk said Thursday it will take legal action against Hims & Hers after the telehealth provider announced it would launch a cheaper copycat version of Novo's Wegovy weight loss pill.\"The action by Hims & Hers is illegal mass compounding that poses a significant risk to patient safety,\" Novo said in a statement. \"Novo Nordisk will take legal and regulatory action to protect patients, our intellectual property and the integrity of the US gold-standard drug approval framework. \"This is another example of Hims & Hers' historic behaviour of duping the American public with knock-off GLP-1 products, and the FDA has previously warned them about their deceptive advertising of GLP-1 knock-offs,\" the statement said. Shares of Novo Nordisk as well as rival Eli Lilly each fell roughly 7% after Hims announced the cheaper Wegovy copy for $49, far less than the $149 Novo sells the branded pill for. Hims stock initially spiked on the announcement, but pared gains after Novo said it would fight the rollout. Novo launched its Wegovy pill in the U.S. in early January, and CEO Mike Doustdar told CNBC on Wednesday that 170,000 people were already taking the medication. Hims & Hers had previously been offering compounded semaglutide, the active ingredient in Novo's blockbuster drugs Ozempic and Wegovy, in an injectable format, and is now extending the offering to include the oral version. Hims said the Wegovy pill copy would cost $49 for the first month and $99 thereafter with a 5-month plan.Semaglutide's patent is protected in the U.S. until 2032, but Hims says its copies are \"personalized,\" and therefore legal.\"This compounded product uses a different formulation and delivery system than FDA-approved oral semaglutide,\" Hims said.\"This once-a-day pill has the same active ingredient as Wegovy and empowers providers to tailor treatment plans specifically for those who prefer to avoid needles or need smaller doses to help to balance side-effects,\" it said. Novo highlighted that it manufactures its Wegovy pill using so-called SNAC technology, which facilitates absorption when administered orally. It's not clear exactly how Hims' copy formula could match the level of absorption.As recently as last year, Novo and Hims partnered to offer discounted weight loss jabs to the telehealth company's customers. Novo, however, ended the collaboration just two months later and said Hims used \"deceptive\" marketing that put patient safety at risk.Lilly doesn't yet have an oral GLP-1 option on the market but is expected to launch a rival pill, orforglipron, in the first half of this year, pending Food and Drug Administration approval.\"With the ... current legal backdrop, there is no reason why HIMS shouldn't evaluate these launches for every subsequent weight loss product as the market continues to evolve,\" Leerink analyst Michael Cherny said in a note to clients. Eli Lilly didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.Mounting challengesThursday's news from Hims adds to the pressure Novo has been facing over the past year. In 2025, the stock fell nearly 50% in its worst year ever as investors lost confidence in the Danish drugmaker's ability to keep sales growing amid ever-increasing competition. Shares are down another 15% year to date.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconNovo Nordisk shares have trailed Eli Lilly stock over the past year. Hims' announcement comes days after Novo forecast sales and profits declining between 5% and 13% in 2026, mainly due to pricing pressures in the U.S. and loss of exclusivity for semaglutide in certain markets outside of the U.S., like Canada and China, this year.In contrast, Lilly sees sales growing by about 25% this year.Doustdar explained Novo's worse-than-expected outlook as an indication that things will get worse before they get better. \"We are creating affordability for the patients, millions of patients that are right now in need of GLP-1 products but simply could not afford it. To do that short term, you have to take a headwind. But of course, there's a very long tail wind for years to come,\" he told CNBC. ",

Tesla continues to expand its footprint in China, with the Shanghai Gigafactory contributing significantly to the company’s global production capacity. (Photo by Cheng Xin/Getty Images)Cheng Xin | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesTesla remained a strong contender in Beijing's competitive electric vehicle scene, as the company's China-produced EV sales grew modestly in January from the year before, amid a broader industry slowdown.According to data published by the China Passenger Car Association on Wednesday, January deliveries from Tesla's Shanghai Gigafactory rose by 9% to 69,129 units, from 63,238 in January 2025.The latest January deliveries places Tesla in third place against other Chinese EV manufacturers. BYD was in the lead at 205,518 shipments, while Geely came in second with 124,252 units, according to the CPCA.Despite the rise in deliveries, there is little indication of an actual growth in demand for Tesla's offerings in China — the world's largest EV market.The company's January delivery figures reflect the total number of shipments from Tesla's Shanghai Gigafactory, which produces the Model 3 and Model Y for domestic and foreign markets in Europe, the Asia-Pacific, and elsewhere.New registrations in January for Tesla passenger vehicles — a proxy for sales — rose slightly in Europe, according to Reuters.Domestic price warTesla has faced stiff competition from a number of Chinese EV brands with more affordable offerings. In a separate report, the CPCA noted that the total sales of Tesla's China-produced EVs fell by 4.8% in 2025 — one of only two manufacturers in Beijing that reported declining annual sales from the year before.At around 235,500 yuan ($33,943), Tesla's base Model 3 sedan costs nearly three times the price of the base model for BYD's Seal, at around 79,800 yuan.Like other automakers, Tesla has sought to maintain its competitiveness in China through aggressive price cuts. According to its Chinese website, Tesla has begun offering five-year 0% interest loans, or seven-year \"ultra-low\" interest rate loans for orders placed before Feb. 28.\"We have [had] really intense price wars that have gone on, although the government and industry have called on automakers to not engage with aggressive pricing strategies,\" Abbie Tu, principal research analyst from S&P Global Mobility, tells CNBC.Despite these involutive price wars, China's EV market has slowed considerably.According to CPCA data, new energy vehicle sales, which include hybrid and battery-powered cars, grew by only 1% year on year in January - a fourth-straight month of slowing growth.The slowdown is projected to continue, as Beijing has slashed support for new EV sales. From Jan. 1, a 5% tax on new energy vehicle purchases was reinstated, after previously being exempted from the full 10% tax for more than a decade. New energy vehicles include battery and hybrid-powered cars.New regulationsTesla's challenges are further compounded by a recent announcement from Beijing which will effectively ban concealed door handles. On Monday, China's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology announced that from Jan. 1, 2027, all door handles on cars sold in the country must have interior and exterior mechanical releases.The announcement follows a spate of high-profile incidents in the U.S. and China, where EV occupants involved in road accidents could not be freed after their vehicles caught fire, as a result of power failures in the door-locking mechanisms.While automakers in China have a decent runway to ensure compliance with the new regulations, it remains to be seen how Tesla will adapt, given that flush door handles were first popularized as a signature design feature on Tesla's minimalist vehicles.Some analysts, like Tu Le, founder and managing director of consulting firm Sino Auto Insights, see China's new car door handle restrictions as likely to pose a \"decent sized headache\" for Tesla.However, Tu said, China's new regulations will likely have little impact on most automakers.\"I think for lots of Chinese brands, this new regulation [will not] take them by surprise, because when regulators were drafting the new regulations, they consulted OEMs and industry experts intensively,\" Tu says.

Elissa Slotkin of Michigan said Thursday that she had refused to sit for a requested interview with the Department of Justice for its investigation over a video in which she and five other Democratic lawmakers urged U.S. troops not to follow illegal orders.\"I'm not going to be sitting down for this inquiry. I'm not going to legitimize their actions,\" Slotkin said in a videotaped statement she posted on X.Slotkin's lawyer also sent letters to Attorney General Pam Bondi and U.S. Attorney for Washington, D.C., Jeanine Pirro, informing them of her noncompliance, and asking Bondi to order Pirro to drop the probe.The lawyer, Preet Bharara, urged Pirro to retain her records because of \"anticipated litigation concerning potential violations of the Senator's First Amendment rights and your office's vindictive and retaliatory investigation.\"Bharara, in a letter to Pirro, said that the message of the Nov. 18 video featuring Slotkin and the other Democrats \"is uncontroversial and incontrovertible.\"\"It is therefore perplexing that the Department of Justice has begun an inquiry into the matter. For the reasons set forth below, our client will not submit to an interview in these circumstances and on this record,\" wrote Bharara, who previously served as U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York.Pirro's office declined to comment on the letters. CNBC has requested comment from the DOJ.Slotkin, in her video on X on Thursday, said that the Trump administration's aggressive reaction to her original video to U.S. troops resulted in a torrent of threats against her, her family, and her staff.\"To be honest, many lawyers told me to just be quiet, keep my head down, and hopefully this will all just go away,\" she said.\"But that's exactly what the Trump administration and Jeanine Pirro want.\"\"They are purposely using physical and legal intimidation to get me to shut up. But more importantly, they're using that intimidation to deter others from speaking out against their administration,\" Slotkin said. \"The intimidation is the point, and I'm not gonna go along with that,\" she said.In the Nov. 18 video, titled \"Don't give up the ship,\" the former CIA officer Slotkin and the other lawmakers deliver a straight-to-camera address to members of the U.S. military.\"Our laws are clear: You can refuse illegal orders,\" Slotkin said on that video.The others in the video were Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona, a former U.S. Navy captain and NASA astronaut, and Reps. Jason Crow of Colorado, Maggie Goodlander of New Hampshire, and Chris Deluzio and Chrissy Houlahan, both of Pennsylvania.The video was published as the U.S. military carried out a succession of airstrikes in the Caribbean targeting boats purported to be smuggling drugs. The boat attacks — whose legality has been questioned — have resulted in at least 126 deaths since early September, according to The New York Times.President Donald Trump raged against the video, accusing the Democrats who appeared on it of sedition and treason, while calling for their arrest. \"Their words cannot be allowed to stand — We won't have a Country anymore!!!\" Trump wrote on Truth Social on Nov. 20. \"An example MUST BE SET.\"In a subsequent post, he wrote: \"SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR, punishable by DEATH!\"Days later, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth echoed Trump, calling the video \"despicable, reckless, and false\" and labeling the Democrats the \"Seditious Six.\" The Pentagon initially said it was reviewing \"serious allegations of misconduct\" against Kelly, and then later moved to cut his military retirement pay in retaliation for the video.The lawmakers in late November said that the FBI sought to interview them. Kelly filed a federal civil lawsuit against Hegseth and the Pentagon on Jan. 12 over his punishment for the video.On the same day, Slotkin told the Times that Pirro's office sent the Senate's sergeant-at-arms a request to interview either her or her private counsel.In a court hearing Tuesday, U.S. District Judge Richard Leon expressed skepticism about the Pentagon's attempt to censure Kelly over his involvement in the video.

    "body": "Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) (L), and Sheikh Tahnoon bin Zayed Al NahyanGetty Image | ReutersSen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., will ask the Senate on Thursday to condemn and call for the reversal of the sale of 500,000 advanced artificial intelligence chips to the United Arab Emirates. Warren's resolution, shared exclusively with CNBC, comes after a report in The Wall Street Journal last week that Sheikh Tahnoon bin Zayed Al Nahyan of the United Arab Emirates, also known as the \"Spy Sheikh,\" purchased a secret 49% stake in the Trump family’s World Liberty Financial days before President Donald Trump's inauguration. The stake reportedly saw roughly $187 million flow to Trump family entities.The chip deal came just months after Tahnoon's purchase in World Liberty Financial, prompting allegations of bribery. Prior U.S. administrations have warned against selling chips to the UAE, citing concern that they will fall into the hands of China. Tahnoon's own AI enterprise, G42, will receive chips as part of the deal. \"Why in the world was Donald Trump trying to ship off our state-of-the-art chips to the UAE — and China — when American startups, universities, and small businesses need them here at home?\" Warren is expected to ask on the floor when she introduces her resolution. A draft of it has been viewed by CNBC. \"Well, now we know that the UAE greased the skids months earlier when it secretly agreed to pour hundreds of millions of dollars into a Trump family crypto venture just four days before President Trump's inauguration.\"President Donald Trump shakes hands with Tahnoun bin Zayed Al Nahyan, National Security Advisor of UAE, next to UAE President Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, left, after arriving on Air Force One at Abu Dhabi International Airport, Thursday, May 15, 2025, in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates.Alex Brandon | APIf agreed to on the Senate floor, the resolution would resolve that the Senate \"Condemns Donald Trump's decision to allow the sale of advanced AI chips to the United Arab Emirates and calls for the reversal of this decision.\"The chip deal would send 500,000 of Nvidia's chips to the UAE annually, including the most advanced silicon the U.S. company makes. The U.S. is battling with China over AI dominance, and tightly guards its technology.Warren's push for a vote on the resolution is likely to be blocked on the Senate floor, where any senator could object to the measure. But it could put Republicans — who have also warned about AI chips reaching China — in a difficult spot. \"Trump is profiting from decisions that make it easier for countries like China to get their hands on some of our most sensitive and advanced technology,\" Warren, the top Democrat on the Senate banking committee, is expected to say. \"Congress needs to grow a spine. We cannot allow American national security to be sold to the highest bidder,\" she's expected to add. The Trump administration has denied wrongdoing related to Tahnoon's purchase and the chip deal. Trump, asked about the deal this week, said, \"Well, I don't know about it.\" ",

    "body": "Newly appointed Reserve Bank of India Governor Sanjay Malhotra after addressing a press conference, in Mumbai on Dec. 11, 2024.Indranil Mukherjee | Afp | Getty ImagesIndia's central bank on Friday kept its policy rates unchanged, as headwinds to growth have weakened following the announcement of trade deals with the E.U. and the U.S.Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the policy rate to remain unchanged at 5.25%. \"External headwinds have intensified, though the successful completion of trade deals augurs well\" for overall economic outlook, said Sanjay Malhotra, governor of Reserve Bank of India, explaining the reason for hitting a pause on the easing cycle.He added that in the near term, domestic inflation and growth outlook remain positive.The Reserve Bank of India cut benchmark rates by 125 basis points last year, and economists say the focus will now shift to transmission of the previous rate cuts.  watch nowThe RBI will likely hold rates for at least a year, Santanu Sengupta, chief India economist at Goldman Sachs, told CNBC's \"Inside India.\" There was an \"outside chance of a rate cut,\" if the U.S.-India trade deal had not gone through, he added.Earlier this week, U.S. President Donald Trump announced that Washington will cut tariffs on Indian exports to 18%, dispelling the central bank's worries around external headwinds to growth it had flagged in the last policy meet. The U.S. had levied 50% tariffs on India, amongst the highest across countries and more than on China with which it has had an adversarial relationship, souring ties between New Delhi and Washington.The RBI will focus on transmission of rates as the yields on long-term bonds are \"unlikely to come off,\" said Sengupta, as banks and insurance companies taper their buying of long-term government securities coupled while the supply of bonds is rising.India will borrow 17.2 trillion rupees ($187 billion) in the financial year starting April 1, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said in her budget speech on Sunday. This figure marks an increase of 18% from the revised estimate for financial year 2026 and was higher than market estimates.In its December policy meet, the RBI cut interest rates by 25 basis points to 5.25% in a unanimous decision, citing \"weakness in some key economic indicators.\"According to India's economic survey, released just days before the U.S.-India deal announcement, the country's economy is expected to grow by 7.4% in the fiscal year ending March 2026, and between 6.8% and 7.2% the following year. That puts India on track to keeping its crown of being the world's fastest growing large economy.The RBI has little to worry on the inflation front too. India's consumer inflation rose to 1.33% in December, slightly accelerating from 0.71% in the prior month.",

Michael Nagle | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesLayoff plans hit their highest January total since the global financial crisis while hiring intentions reached their lowest since the same period, outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas reported Thursday.U.S. employers announced 108,435 layoffs for the month, up 118% from the same period a year ago and 205% from December 2025. The total marked the highest for any January since 2009, while the economy was in the final months of its steepest downturn since the Great Depression.At the same time, companies announced just 5,306 new hires, also the lowest January since 2009, which is when Challenger began tracking such data. The crisis recession officially ended in March 2009.With the recent narrative centering on a no-hire, no-fire labor market, the Challenger data suggests that the layoff part of the equation could be stepping up.\"Generally, we see a high number of job cuts in the first quarter, but this is a high total for January,\" said Andy Challenger, workplace expert and chief revenue officer for the firm. \"It means most of these plans were set at the end of 2025, signaling employers are less-than-optimistic about the outlook for 2026.\"To be sure, if employers are stepping up plans to furlough workers, it hasn't been showing up much in official government data. watch nowHowever, initial jobless claims for the week ended Jan. 31 totaled a seasonally adjusted 231,000, the highest since early December though the spike likely had something to do with a brutal winter storm that hit large parts of the country. The longer-term trend still was at its lowest since October 2024.Some high-profile layoff announcements have boosted fears of wider damage in the labor market. Amazon, UPS and Dow Inc. recently have announced sizeable job cuts. Indeed, transportation had the highest level from a sector standpoint in January, due largely to plans from UPS to cut more than 30,000 workers. Technology was second on the back of Amazon's announcement to shed 16,000 mostly corporate level jobs.Planned hiring dropped 13% from January 2025 and was off 49% from December.Challenger data also can be volatile and not correlated to official statistics. However, filings with the Labor Department in January under Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification regulations indicate more than 100 companies have given notice of significant layoffs.In a separate report Thursday, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that job openings fell sharply in December to 6.54 million, a slide of 386,000 on a monthly basis and down more than 900,000 from the October level. Openings are now at their lowest since September 2020.The decrease in available positions put the ratio of available jobs to unemployed workers at 0.87 to 1, down from more than 2 to 1 at its peak in mid-2022.  On Wednesday, ADP reported that private employers added just 22,000 jobs in January.watch now",

Analysts polled by StreetAccount had expected $34.93 billion. AWS represented about 17% of Amazon's total revenue for the quarter.Operating income within AWS came to $12.47 billion, more than StreetAccount's $11.91 billion consensus, accounting for most of its parent company's profits. AWS' operating margin widened slightly to 35% from 34.6% in the third quarter.Amazon leads the cloud infrastructure market, which its introduced almost 20 years ago, but Google and Microsoft have rapidly growing businesses in the space and, according to many analysts, are seeing stronger growth from artificial intelligence services. On Wednesday, Alphabet said revenue from the Google Cloud group, which includes Google Workspace productivity software bundles along with Google Cloud Platform infrastructure, jumped about 48%, the fastest growth since 2021.

    "body": "President Donald Trump makes an announcement from the Oval Office at the White House in Washington, Nov. 6, 2025.Jonathan Ernst | ReutersPresident Donald Trump on Thursday announced the launch of TrumpRx — a direct-to-consumer website that is key to his administration's efforts to lower prescription drug costs in the U.S. The president said millions of Americans would save money through the platform. But it's still unclear if all patients — particularly those with insurance coverage — will see more cost savings from using that site to buy their medicines than they would through existing methods. TrumpRx targets people who are willing to pay with cash and forgo insurance, which suggests that patients without or with limited coverage may benefit the most. \"You're going to save a fortune and this is also so good for overall health care,\" Trump said at an event Thursday night unveiling the website.The site does not sell drugs directly to American patients, but acts as a central hub that points them to drugmakers that are offering discounts on certain products on their own direct-to-consumer sites, or gives them discount coupons to take to pharmacies. For example, Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk were already offering their blockbuster obesity drugs at hefty discounts to cash-paying patients, even before the reductions Trump touted on Thursday.Clicking on the platform's offer for Lilly's popular Zepbound weight loss injection sends consumers to the company's LillyDirect platform, where they can order the treatment and submit prescription details.A screenshot of a Zepbound order on the TrumpRx website.\nPreview\nFilters\nSource InfoIn recent months, Lilly, Novo and at least 14 other drugmakers have negotiated agreements with the Trump administration to participate on the platform and voluntarily sell certain medicines at a discount to Medicaid patients. Those landmark deals are part of Trump's broader \"most favored nation\" policy, which pushes to link U.S. drug prices to the lowest ones abroad.At launch, the site features only medications from the first five companies to strike pricing deals with the administration: AstraZeneca, Lilly, EMD Serono, Novo Nordisk and Pfizer, according to a White House fact sheet. It will list drugs from other companies \"in the coming months,\" the administration said.The platform is the government's latest effort to try to rein in U.S. prescription drug prices, which are two to three times higher on average than those in other developed nations — and up to 10 times more than in certain countries, according to the Rand Corp., a public policy think tank.But TrumpRx \"doesn't seem like it is the only solution\" to that issue for most Americans, said Juliette Cubanski, deputy director of the program on Medicare Policy at KFF, a health policy research organization. The cash-pay offerings could be better deals for patients without insurance, but it's difficult to assess exactly how many people stand to benefit from TrumpRx, she added. \"If they're able to get a drug covered by their insurance at a relatively affordable copay, then there's not a great upside to using the TrumpRx website,\" Cubanski said. She said people with insurance coverage who buy through direct-to-consumer platforms may also not have their purchases count toward their benefits, which means it doesn't help them meet their deductible or out-of-pocket maximum. But Cubanski said there's potential for TrumpRx to be helpful in expanding access to certain drugs at more affordable prices, particularly medicines not covered widely by insurance in the U.S., such as obesity drugs. Medicare will start covering weight loss treatments for the first time later this year as part of the deals Lilly and Novo struck with Trump, but many employers are still hesitant to cover those drugs. Still, many of the other products expected to be listed on TrumpRx are already widely covered through insurance, and some are available as cheaper generics from competing drugmakers. Questions about savingsQuestions remain about how much savings people can expect if they buy their medicines at direct-to-consumer prices. The announced price reductions for certain drugs are framed as steep cuts from their so-called retail list prices. For example, under Novo Nordisk's agreement with the administration, some doses of its diabetes drug Ozempic will be priced at $350 per month on TrumpRx, which is less than half of its roughly $1,000 monthly list price. But those list prices are often far higher than what private insurers and government programs ultimately pay for medicines after rebates, discounts and other concessions, according to researchers at Georgetown's Medicare Policy Initiative. That suggests some payers may already be securing prices comparable to — or lower than — the newly announced discounts on medications under the Trump deals. The Georgetown researchers cited one study that found that average discounts on brand-name drugs in Medicare Part D run around 40% of list prices. Meanwhile, discounts in Medicaid exceed 75%, according to a Congressional Budget Office study. In the private sector, \"we've got insurers and pharmacy benefit managers negotiating lower prices and designing an insurance benefit that enables people to benefit from those price negotiations,\" said KFF's Cubanski. \"My guess is that for most drugs, at least most brand-name medications, people are likely to get a better deal using their insurance rather than purchasing a drug through a direct-to-consumer website,\" she said. Drugs on TrumpRxAt the launch of the site, the administration listed a range of major drugs as available for discounts, with a particular emphasis on popular GLP-1 products:Ozempic injection for diabetes, made by Novo Nordisk: Starting at $199 per month, down from around $1,000Wegovy injection for obesity, made by Novo Nordisk: Starting at $199 per month, down from around $1,350Wegovy pill for obesity, made by Novo Nordisk: $149 per month for the starting dosesZepbound injection for obesity, made by Eli Lilly: starting at $299 per month, down from $1,086The White House also put an emphasis on cash-pay discounts for fertility drugs like Gonal-F from EMD Serono, which was listed at $168. Dozens of other drugs that companies expected to be be listed on the platform were not as of Thursday night. Those include key treatments from companies including Amgen, Merck and Gilead, among others.In an interview with CNBC at a conference in January, Bristol Myers Squibb CEO Chris Boerner said the company has multiple products on its existing direct-to-consumer platform, which first offered a cash-pay discount on its blood thinner Eliquis. That platform will eventually link to TrumpRx, he said. The company is going to examine ways to put additional products in its portfolio on its own platform, \"where it makes sense,\" Boerner added. He said Bristol Myers is \"aligned with the administration\" on the issue of the U.S. health care system being too complex, and said several middlemen can increase costs. \"What we like about these [direct-to-consumer models], where they make sense from a business standpoint, is you're able to circumvent some of that,\" Boerner said. Meanwhile, in an exclusive interview with CNBC last week, Eli Lilly CEO Dave Ricks said the company was the first drugmaker to sell obesity treatments directly to patients, and that TrumpRx is \"taking that and expanding it across the industry\" to other medicines.\"We're all for that,\" Ricks said.",

    "body": "The Anthropic AI logo is displayed on a mobile phone with a visual digital background.Nurphoto | Nurphoto | Getty ImagesThe software sector faced renewed market concerns this week after artificial intelligence company Anthropic released new AI tools, triggering a sell-off in software-as-a-service and data provider stocks. Anthropic's new AI tools, built for its Claude \"Cowork\" AI agent, are designed to handle complex professional workflows that many software and data providers sell as core products.The tools and other similar AI agents target functions ranging from legal and technology research, customer relationship management and analytics. That has raised concerns that AI could undercut traditional software business models.The S&P 500 Software & Services Index, which has 140 constituents, fell over 4% on Thursday, extending its losing streak to eight sessions. The index is down about 20% so far this year.Shares of Thomson Reuters, Salesforce and LegalZoom were among the hardest hit in U.S. trading this week, with the sell-off spreading to Asian IT firms Tata Consultancy Services and Infosys.Despite the market jitters, analysts and tech executives remain divided on the long-term impact of these AI tools on these industries. 'Illogical' panic?Among tech leaders downplaying market concerns that AI will replace enterprise software is Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang.\"There's this notion that the software industry is in decline and will be replaced by AI,\" he said at an event on Wednesday. \"It is the most illogical thing in the world.\"The influential tech leader instead argued that AI will use and enhance existing software tools rather than completely reinventing them. Rene Haas, CEO of British chip designer Arm Holdings, echoed that sentiment this week, arguing during an earnings call that enterprise AI deployment is still in its early days and not yet massively transformative. Haas described recent market fears as \"micro-hysteria\" in comments to the Financial Times.  watch nowStill, concerns about the software sector predate the latest sell-offs. Hedge funds have already shorted about $24 billion in software stocks this year as of Wednesday. Short sellers borrow shares, sell them and aim to buy them back later at a lower price for a profit.Meanwhile, Anthropic on Thursday launched what it called an improved AI model, ‌coming just days after its latest Claude tools spooked investors.Mixed outlook While many tech analysts have increasingly warned that AI is going \"to eat\" software over the long term, views on that risk and the latest sell-off in software stocks remain mixed. In a research note on Wednesday, Wedbush Securities echoed Jensen Huang's comments, saying that while AI is a headwind for software providers, the sell-off reflected an \"Armageddon scenario for the sector that is far from reality.\" \"Enterprises won't completely overhaul tens of billions of dollars of prior software infrastructure investments to migrate over to Anthropic, OpenAI, and others,\" the note said. Large enterprises, Wedbush Securities said, took decades to accumulate trillions of data points now ingrained in their software infrastructure.Other analysts see more lasting pressure. Advisory firm Constellation Research said Wednesday the sell-off reflects concerns that AI could pressure profits and limit how much software companies can charge, rather than signaling a death knell for the industry.\"There's likely to be cannibalization of SaaS by AI-driven workflows and that will impact the multiple the sector trades on,\" Rolf Bulk, tech equities analyst at Futurum Group, told CNBC.That said, Bulk argued that a subset of software providers, especially those running mission-critical enterprise workloads such as Oracle and ServiceNow, still have a sustained \"right to earn.\" The depth of their data and entrenched role in customer workflows make them more likely to coexist with AI rather than be replaced outright, he added.That bet is being pursued by software firms such as AlphaSense, a market data and research firm that leverages AI tools across its product offerings. In a statement to CNBC, Chris Ackerson, SVP of Product at AlphaSense said that the \"future belongs to providers that combine advanced AI with trusted content, explainability and deep domain context.\"— CNBC's Matthew Chin contributed to this report",

    "body": "Sen. Elizabeth Warren (L), and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent during a Senate Banking Committee hearing on Feb. 5th, 2026.Getty Images | ReutersTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Thursday refused to rule out the possibility of a criminal investigation of Kevin Warsh, President Donald Trump's nominee for Federal Reserve chair, if Warsh ends up refusing to cut interest rates.Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, the top Democrat on the Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee, questioned Bessent about a joke Trump made over the weekend about suing Warsh if he does not reduce rates to the president's liking, according to The Wall Street Journal. \"I think it was a joke, but just in case, this should be an easy one, Mr. Secretary: can you commit right here and now that Trump's Fed nominee Kevin Warsh will not be sued, will not be investigated by the Department of Justice if he doesn't cut interest rates exactly the way that Donald Trump wants?\" Warren asked. \"That is up to the president,\" Bessent said, as the questioning devolved into cross talk.U.S. presidents typically leave interest rate decisions up to the Fed, with a metaphorical firewall between the independent board and the White House.watch nowBessent's testimony before the Senate committee was his second appearance on Capitol Hill in as many days. On Wednesday, he was grilled by Democrats during a contentious hearing of the House Financial Services Committee. Democrats there pressed Bessent on tariffs and inflation, regulation of cryptocurrencies, and the independence of the Federal Reserve, a hot-button issue.Trump in recent months has targeted Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell over his refusal to lower interest rates to the president's liking. Powell on Jan. 11 revealed he was the subject of an unprecedented investigation by the Department of Justice relating to cost overruns on the renovation of the Federal Reserve headquarters. Trump critics have characterized the investigation, which is based in part on testimony Powell gave to the Senate banking committee last year, as a thinly veiled attempt to strong arm the independent central bank.Committee Chair Tim Scott, R-S.C., said this week he does not believe Powell committed a crime in his testimony. And Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., a member of the committee, has vowed to block the nomination of Warsh, unless the probe into Powell is dropped. Powell's term as chairman ends in May. Trump, meanwhile, doubled down on the investigation earlier this week.Warren and her Democratic colleagues on the committee have also called on Scott to hold up Warsh's nomination until the probes into Powell and Federal Reserve Board Governor Lisa Cook -- who is being investigated for alleged mortgage fraud -- are ended.\"Donald Trump has been trying to take over the Fed for months and months now,\" Warren said before Thursday's hearing. \"He's threatened to fire Jerome Powell. He started a bogus criminal investigation against him. He started a bogus investigation trying to fire Lisa Cook, and now he wants to appoint his man who's going to do exactly what he says at the Fed.\"\"That's a takeover,\" Warren continued.",

The WisdomTree Cloud Computing Fund is down more than 20% year to date. \"Everybody has seen this transformation happen with software engineering in the last year and a half, where vibe coding started to exist as a concept, and people could now do things with their ideas,\" Scott White, Anthropic's head of product for enterprise, told CNBC in an interview. \"I think that we are now transitioning almost into vibe working.\"Read more CNBC tech newsAlphabet resets the bar for AI infrastructure spendingSoftware experiencing 'most exciting moment' as AI fears hammer the stocksSnap shares rise on fourth-quarter earnings that beat on salesQualcomm stock sinks as memory shortage drags on forecastAnthropic was founded by a group of former OpenAI researchers and executives in 2021, and it's best known for developing a family of AI models called Claude. The company assigns new numbers to the models as they advance across generations, but the largest model in the family is typically called Opus, the midsize model is called Sonnet and the smallest model is Haiku.Anthropic said Claude Opus 4.6 builds on its predecessor's coding skills and is better at planning, code review and debugging and operating reliably within large codebases. The model is also better at pulling relevant information from large sets of documents, doing research and running financial analyses, the company said. Claude Opus 4.6 now holds the top spot on the Finance Agent benchmark, for instance, which evaluates how well agents perform on core financial analyst tasks.Anthropic said the model is available through its chatbot interface at claude.ai, its application programming interface and across all major cloud platforms. \"If I think about the last year, Claude went from a model that you can sort of talk to to accomplish a very small task or get an answer, to something that you can actually hand real significant work to,\" White said. \"Opus 4.6 is a model that makes that shift really concrete for our users.\"WATCH: The software sector lost about 30% of its value in three months.

    "body": "watch nowSoftware, legal services and video games stocks have been selling off in recent weeks on fears that new AI features and tools could wipe them out. But how real is that threat? We decided to find out.CNBC's Deidre Bosa and I used Anthropic's AI coding tool \"Claude Code\" with the goal of creating a replacement for Monday.com, a project management platform with a $5 billion market cap. We didn't expect to get anywhere — we're not developers and we don't have any coding experience. But we have become adept at vibe-coding tools, which are AI tools that can build functioning apps based on commands in plain English from users, including those with limited technical chops. We started out simple, telling Claude to build a project management dashboard similar to Monday, with features like multiple project boards, assigned team members and a status dropdown. It spit out a working prototype in minutes. We then asked Claude to research Monday on its own, identify main features and recreate them. It added a number of other features, including a calendar.The real magic happened when we connected the clone to an email account, essentially spinning up a customized project manager for our personal lives. The AI found Dee's forgotten calendar invite for a kid's birthday party (which she definitely didn't have a gift for yet) and it added reminders to book tickets for an upcoming trip and sign a waiver for another kid's birthday party. It took us under an hour, and had we been paying users, it would have cost something like $5 to $15 in compute credits, depending on how much we went back and forth with the AI agent. As more data centers get built out, that cost could start to come down. So which companies should investors worry about? Silicon Valley insiders we talk to say the most exposed names are the ones that \"sit on top of the work\" — tools like Atlassian, Adobe, HubSpot, Zendesk, and Smartsheet, that aren't core to businesses. They say cybersecurity stocks like CrowdStrike and Palo Alto are harder to disrupt since they have network effects that no one would want to try to replicate and maintain. Systems of record may be safer, but not immune. Salesforce, for instance, anchors a business with enterprise data, making it harder to clone with a weekend coding project. With the wholesale sell-off in software this year, that may be a chance for investors to separate between the need-to-haves and nice-to-haves.

    "body": "US Federal Reserve Board Chairman Jerome Powell speaks during a news conference following a Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting in Washington, DC, on Dec. 10, 2025.Saul Loeb | AFP | Getty ImagesIn the Federal Reserve's battle between fighting inflation and limiting unemployment, the latter side carried the day Wednesday and could also have an edge heading into 2026 if labor market weakness becomes more evident through an apparent overcounting of jobs numbers.In the immediate term, worries over the employment situation meant a vote, albeit divided by a 9-3 margin, to lower the central bank's key interest rate by a quarter percentage point. Down the road, there are indications that policymakers will be more inclined to cut further if the labor market stays soft. At his Wednesday news conference, Chair Jerome Powell mentioned several times that there likely has been negative job growth in recent months, a condition that would argue for easier monetary policy.\"Gradual cooling in the labor market has continued,\" Powell said. \"Surveys of households and businesses both show declining supply and demand for workers. So, I think you can say that the labor market has continued to cool gradually, just a touch more gradually than we thought.\"At issue is a monthly estimate the Bureau of Labor Statistics performs of how the labor market is affected by businesses closing and opening. The estimate, known as the birth-death model, takes a guess at the jobs gained by openings and lost by closings.Powell said the model has probably overstated jobs by about 60,000 per month since April. With job growth averaging just shy of 40,000 in that period, an overstatement that size would equate to payroll losses of about 20,000 per month.Powell urges cautionThe chair called the discrepancy \"something of a systematic overcount\" that likely will see big revisions to job growth numbers.In September, the BLS released a preliminary benchmark estimate that job growth was overstated by 911,000 in the 12-month period preceding March 2025. A final count is scheduled to come out in February.In \"a world where job creation is negative, I just think we need to watch that situation very carefully and be in a position where we're not pushing down job creation with our policy,\" Powell said.Balancing support for the labor market with keeping inflation under control will be central to policymaking as the Fed enters 2026. Officials at this week's Federal Open Market Committee meeting expressed a broad divergence of opinion on where rates should head. Six of the 19 participants said they opposed the latest rate cut — two of them were among the 12 who vote — and seven indicated they don't see the need for any reductions next year, according to the \"dot plot\" of individual expectations.On the other side are those who think there is at least some room for further easing. That would point to greater concerns about the labor market, even as inflation holds above the Fed's 2% target. However, Powell said much of the inflation overshoot is coming from President Donald Trump's tariffs, whose impact is expected to wane as the months go on.Market sees more cutsShould the view hold that inflation is subsiding and the labor market is stumbling, the Fed would then be expected to tilt toward an easing bias, particularly with Powell leaving his position as chair in May. \"With the Fed's most influential members keeping a keen eye on the unemployment rate, we think that as long as labor demand wanes and [the] unemployment rate increases, the path will be cleared for additional cuts, despite the vocal opposition from the hawks,\" Natixis economist Christopher Hodge said in a note.\"Because we see the unemployment rate rising through Q1 2026, we think the Fed will continuing cutting to arrest further softening in the labor market,\" Hodge added, noting that \"we think a cut in January is more likely than not.\"Stocks rallied Wednesday and Thursday amid hopes that the rhetoric out of the FOMC was not as hawkish as feared. Still, futures market pricing is indicating the next cut won't come until at least April. Traders also are putting odds on two reductions in 2026, which is more aggressive than the dot-plot indication of one, with even a 41% probability of three moves, according to the CME Group's FedWatch measure.",

    "body": "Customers walk in the parking lot outside a Costco store on Dec. 2, 2025 in Chicago, Illinois. Scott Olson | Getty ImagesCostco on Thursday surpassed Wall Street's quarterly expectations and posted year-over-year sales growth of 8.2% as the retailer attracted more digital sales and opened new locations.The warehouse club does not share a full-year outlook. On the company's earnings call, CFO Gary Millerchip said e-commerce gains were one of the strengths of the quarter. Digital sales jumped by 20.5% year over year. Traffic on its website increased 24% year over year and traffic on its app shot up 48%. Same-day delivery service offered through Instacart in the U.S. and Uber and DoorDash internationally grew at a faster pace than overall digital sales.Costco had a positive start to the busiest weeks of the holiday season, too. Millerchip said Black Friday was a record-breaking day for the warehouse club's U.S. e-commerce business, generating over $250 million in non-food orders.Here's how Costco did in its fiscal first quarter compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:Earnings per share: $4.50 vs. $4.27 expectedRevenue: $67.31 billion vs. $67.14 billion expectedCostco has attracted new members and higher sales at its clubs and online as U.S. consumers across incomes seek value while shopping for groceries, household essentials, holiday gifts and more. Along with its warehouse club competitors, Costco has gained traction with younger customers who are signing up for memberships. Costco has also benefitted from a membership fee increase in the U.S. and Canada, which took effect in September 2024, and kicked in as new members signed up or as existing customers' renewed their annual memberships when they lapsed.In the three-month period that ended Nov. 23, Costco's net income rose to $2 billion, or $4.50 per share, from $1.80 billion, or $4.04 per share, in the year-ago quarter. Revenue increased to $67.31 billion from $62.15 billion in the year-ago quarter.Comparable sales, an industry metric that takes out the impact of one-time factors like store openings and closures, increased 5.9% in the U.S. and 6.4% across the globe. Sales in non-food were led by pharmacy, gold and jewelry, tires, small electrics and apparel, which grew by double-digits year-over-year, Millerchip said.In the first quarter, Costco opened eight new warehouse clubs, including a relocation in Canada, its third location in France, four new locations in the U.S. and two additional Canadian business centers, CEO Ron Vachris said on the company's earnings call. Business centers tend to sell bulk items intended for restaurants and other types of businesses. Those additional locations bring its total store count to 921 around the world.He said the company plans to continue to open 30 or more clubs per year in future years.Read moreAs a warehouse club, Costco relies on membership fees to boost its revenue and help keep the price of its items low. With higher tariffs, however, the retailer has dealt with rising costs. About a third of Costco's U.S. sales come from imported goods.Inflation \"remained relatively consistent with recent quarters,\" Millerchip said. He said in grocery, Costco saw higher inflation in commodities such as beef, seafood and coffee, but that was offset by lower inflation in eggs, cheese, butter and produce. In non-food, he said Costco saw low single-digit inflation for the third consecutive quarter, primarily driven by gold and imported goods. Millerchip said on the earnings call that Costco has looked for ways to reduce the impact of the duties, including sourcing more items from the U.S., consolidating buying across the globe to lower the cost of goods and swapping out categories or items to ones that aren't as exposed to steep tariff costs.Its private label, Kirkland Signature, is another way to offset tariff prices because it has more control over the supply chain, he said.In late November, Costco sued the Trump administration to get a full refund of new tariffs that it has paid so far this year and to block those import duties from being collected from the company as it waits for a Supreme Court ruling on the duties.As of the end of the quarter, Costco had 81.4 million total paid members, up 5.2% year over year and 145.9 million cardholders, up 5.1% year over year, Millerchip said. Its renewal rate in the U.S. and Canada was 92.2% and its worldwide rate was 89.7%, slipping a bit as more customers sign up for memberships online and those members renew at a slightly lower rate.As of Thursday's close, Costco's shares have declined nearly 4% so far this year. That trails the S&P 500's 17% gains during the same period. However, over the past five years, Costco's stock has jumped by 141%. The company's stock closed at $884.48 on Thursday, bringing its market value to $392.67 billion.",

    "body": "watch nowTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Thursday proposed a major change in how the government approaches financial regulation and stability.In a letter released Thursday afternoon, Bessent will recommended altering the approach of the Financial Stability Oversight Council.Whereas the agency's focus had been tightening regulations and oversight of the institutions it oversees, the new plan will switch that, and push for looser regulation and a freer approach.\"[T]he Council will work with and support member agencies in considering whether aspects of the U.S. financial regulatory framework impose undue burdens and negatively impact economic growth, thereby undermining financial stability,\" the letter states.Bessent further noted that the impact of additional regulations is assessed \"in isolation,\" not in how it impacts the economy broadly.\"The cumulative burdens of regulatory and supervisor regimes, and the interactions among individual rules, are rarely considered,\" he said.FSOC was formed in the wake of the financial crisis of 2008 to monitor and address the kind of systemic risk that led to the collapse of major Wall Street institutions and sent the economy into its worst slump since the Great Depression. The council was created in 2010 as an outgrowth of efforts to prevent such a crisis from happening again.As Treasury secretary, Bessent chairs the council. The proposal coincides with an FSOC meeting slated for Thursday at which he delivers a letter updating where it stands on its work.The plan also lines up with the Trump administration's focus on deregulation, but represents a switch from the council's long-standing tilt toward stronger regulation. Along with the proposal, Bessent is forming a working group whose mission will be to \"explore opportunities for [artificial intelligence] to promote the resilience of the financial system while also monitoring for potential risks to financial stability that might be posed by the adoption of AI.\"Bessent will contend that lowering regulator barriers and oversight will strengthen the financial system and boost economic growth.",

    "body": "watch nowAchieving the American Dream doesn't look the way it used to. Over the years, societal and labor market changes, along with higher prices for everything from health care to higher education, have chipped away at the traditional makeup of the American family, which relied on a singular breadwinner to attain financial security. For starters, fewer couples are married compared to a generation ago and among married couples, both spouses are more likely to work, according to the Pew Research Center — by choice and necessity. \"We used to be in this golden age where you could own a home, a car, and get by on a single income — that is a bygone era,\" Bankrate's economic analyst Sarah Foster told CNBC.Read more CNBC personal finance coverageWhy single-income households are 'a bygone era,' according to expertsIRS releases HSA expansion details under Trump's 'big beautiful bill'What December's Fed rate cut means for your moneyStudent loan borrowers have 'a limited time' to leave payment pauseTax changes Social Security beneficiaries may see based on new lawsUncertainty over ACA subsidies persists as enrollment deadline looms53% of investors with a required withdrawal for 2025 still haven't taken it: FidelityWhy jewelry owners may want to check their homeowners insurance coverageMany student loan borrowers say it's harder to cover basic needs: surveyAlmost all companies with 401(k)s allow Roth savings — who benefits401(k) changes for 2026 —one is 'impactful' for high earners, CFP saysKeeping your 401(k) when you retire is easier.

Even six-figure earners in the U.S. said one income feels \"nearly impossible\" to live on, according to a recent survey by The Harris Poll.In about half of all married-couple families, both spouses were employed, according to 2024 data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. In families with children, two-thirds of all households had both spouses working outside the home.\"Where there was a time in the U.S. when a married couple, with children, could get by with a single-wage earner in the house, those days are mostly vestiges of the past,\" according to Mark Hamrick, Bankrate's senior economic analyst.Household expenses have soaredInflation and surging costs for expenses including child care, college, auto loans, homes and rent have created an \"affordability challenge,\" Hamrick said. Across the country, health insurance premiums for family coverage have jumped more than 25% since 2020, outpacing inflation. Both the cost of child care and college tuition have increased more than 5% year after year over the same period, also outpacing inflation and other household expenses, research shows. At the same time, a housing shortfall has helped push rents and mortgage prices far beyond what a single earner may be able to afford. \"Because the costs have been rising so much for so many families, we know the cost of child care, the cost of health care, the need to be able to earn more money just to keep up, necessitated more hours per family,\" said Elise Gould, senior economist at the Economic Policy Institute, a nonprofit think tank.Workplace dynamics have changedSignificant changes in the workplace have also made it more difficult to rely on one income. \"There's been a fracturing of both job security and a sense of belonging that workers have in the workplace,\" Hamrick said. More workers are now part of the gig economy, which means they are less likely to have a sustained, predictable income or workplace benefits, he said, eroding long-term job stability: \"If you are part of the gig economy, there's a tremendous amount of insecurity.\"Fewer gig workers — and even full-time employees — have a traditional pension and are increasingly responsible for funding their own retirement plans. \"For workers without predictable hours or benefits, even a full-time schedule isn't enough to guarantee stable income or support a household on one paycheck,\" said Scott Winship, senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative public policy think tank.Increasing opportunities for womenBut there aren't just economic pressures at play. The shift to dual-earner households is also a reflection of the increasing opportunities for women and the elimination of some gender barriers, according to Winship.Women have been making significant strides in their education and careers and are working as much, if not more, than their male counterparts, many studies also show. In a growing share of opposite-sex marriages, women have become breadwinners, or outearn their husbands, according to the Pew Research Center.\"Women have a lot more opportunities than they used to have, and so they're working longer and they're working for higher pay,\" Winship said. That has changed the expectations of what a \"middle-class lifestyle\" entails today, he said.— CNBC lead producer Charlotte Morabito contributed to this report.Subscribe to CNBC on YouTube.",

Hirsh Jain, an executive responsible for the company's health-care portfolio, was added as another defendant in the latest complaint.Palantir said the defendants were \"entrusted\" with the company's \"crown jewels,\" including source code, customer workflows and proprietary customer engagement strategies.The former employees \"brazenly disregarded their contractual and legal commitments to Palantir and instead chose a path of deception and unjust competition,\" the plaintiffs said in the document, which was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York.Cohen and Radha Jain denied the initial allegations in a November filing, and agreed to stop working for Percepta during the proceedings.The suit accused Hirsh Jain, who resigned from Palantir in August 2024, of an \"aggressive campaign\" to recruit other employees to join Percepta, and said the startup has already hired at least 10 former Palantir employees. A message allegedly written by Hirsh Jain in November 2024 read, \"I'm down to pillage the best devs at palantir when they're at their maximum richness.\"The complaint says Radha Jain wrote another message saying, \"God thinking about poaching is so fun.\"Palantir, which was co-founded by Peter Thiel, CEO Alex Karp and others, builds analytics software for companies and government agencies, including the U.S. military. The company's stock price has soared more than tenfold since the end of 2023, lifting its market cap close to $450 billion. Palantir also accused Cohen of sending herself highly confidential documents shortly after announcing her resignation from the company in March. Cohen allegedly took photos of sensitive information, the suit said, and downloaded the files onto her personal phone.\"At Percepta, they seek to succeed not through old-fashioned ingenuity and competition, but through outright theft and deceit,\" Palantir said in the filing.Among other things, Palantir is asking for the defendants to be forced to return any confidential information in their possession and to avoid working at Percepta or venture backer General Catalyst for 12 months from the time of an order.

Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., speaks during a Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee confirmation hearing on President Donald Trump's nominees to lead the National Economic Council, Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and Federal Housing Finance Agency, on Capitol Hill in Washington, Feb. 27, 2025.Annabelle Gordon | ReutersPresident Donald Trump's decision to let Nvidia sell its advanced H200 artificial intelligence chips to China \"sells out American national security,\" Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., said Thursday.Warren also reiterated her call for Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang to testify before Congress about the agreement, along with Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick.The senator's fiery remarks on the Senate floor came three days after Trump announced on social media that the U.S. semiconductor giant Nvidia could sell the chips to \"approved customers\" in China, so long as the U.S. gets a 25% cut of the revenues.The announcement drew concerns both from Democrats and some of Trump's Republican allies, who have been vocal about protecting America's hardware advantage over China in the race to AI superiority.An Nvidia spokesperson, in response to Warren, told CNBC that the H200 sales to China will still require a U.S. government license and \"at most will be a smaller percentage of the Hopper and Blackwell compute already sold to U.S. customers.\"\"We heard the same arguments about the H20, and the administration's critics had it backwards\" the spokesperson said, referring to the less-powerful chips that the White House had previously approved for sale to China.\"Selling H20 was good for America's economic and national security. After H20 shipments were blocked, America lost billions, and foreign AI chip firms stepped into the gap and grew dramatically,\" the spokesperson said.\"America's foreign competitors and the Administration's critics are pushing the same end — to force massive commercial markets to support and promote foreign competition,\" the spokesperson added.Warren, in Thursday's remarks, urged Congress to pass bipartisan legislation that \"reins in this administration\" by imposing new chip export restrictions. Critics of the bill say it could undermine U.S. chipmakers' competitiveness.The Trump administration knows that China gaining access to the chips, which have previously been subject to export restrictions, \"poses a serious threat to our technological leadership and national security,\" Warren said on the Senate floor.She noted that shortly before Trump announced his decision on the H200 chips on Monday, the Department of Justice touted a crackdown touted a crackdown on a \"major China-linked AI tech smuggling network.\"watch now\"So why did the president make this bad deal that sells out the American economy and sells out American national security?\" she asked. \"It's simple: In the Trump administration, money talks.\"\"Mr. Huang understands that in this administration, being able to cozy up to Donald Trump might be the most important corporate CEO skill of all,\" Warren said.She pointed to Huang attending a $1 million-per-plate dinner at Trump's Florida home Mar-a-Lago, and Nvidia's later donations to the president's under-construction White House ballroom.\"Those are just the most obvious possible reasons to cut this deal,\" Warren said, \"and who knows what else Mr. Huang might have done behind closed doors to persuade President Trump and Secretary Lutnick into making this dangerous concession.\"",

    "body": "Open AI CEO Sam Altman speaks during a talk session with SoftBank Group CEO Masayoshi Son at  an event titled \"Transforming Business through AI\" in Tokyo, Japan, on February 03, 2025. Tomohiro Ohsumi | Getty ImagesOn Dec. 11, 2015, OpenAI launched as a nonprofit research lab after Elon Musk and a group of prominent techies, including Peter Thiel and Reid Hoffman, pledged $1 billion to develop artificial intelligence for the benefit of humanity. The idea was for the project to be be free of commercial pressures and the pursuit of money. A decade later, that founding mission is all but forgotten. Musk, now the world's richest person, is long gone, having created rival startup xAI. And he's been engaged in a heated legal and public relations fight with OpenAI CEO and co-founder Sam Altman. Far from the nonprofit realm, OpenAI has emerged as one of the fastest-growing commercial entities on the planet, zooming to a $500 billion private market valuation, with almost all of that value accruing since the company's launch of ChatGPT three years ago. More than 800 million people now use the chatbot every week. Musk's xAI, meanwhile, is expected to close a $15 billion round at a $230 billion pre-money valuation this month, sources familiar with the matter told CNBC's David Faber in late November.OpenAI and xAI are two of the main companies, along with Google, Anthropic and Meta, pouring money into AI models, as the market rapidly evolves from text-based chatbots to AI-generated videos and more advanced compute-intensive forms of content, as well as into agentic AI, with large enterprises customizing tools to enhance productivity. For OpenAI, the price tag is almost incomprehensible: $1.4 trillion and growing. That's primarily for the mammoth data centers and high-powered chips required to meet what the company sees as insatiable demand for its technology. For now, OpenAI is a cash-burning machine going up against tech's megacaps and their chip suppliers, drawing comparisons to earlier waves of high-growth tech firms that spent heavily for years to challenge behemoth incumbents, but to mixed results.\"OpenAI has a very big role in the in the history of the development of artificial intelligence, and will forever have that role,\" said Gil Luria, an equity analyst at D.A. Davidson, in an interview. \"Now, will that role be Netscape, or will it be Google? We've yet to find out.\" Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang speaks at an event ahead of the COMPUTEX forum, in Taipei, Taiwan, June 2, 2024.Ann Wang | ReutersIt's a position that would've been hard to imagine in 2016, when Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang hauled a black DGX-1 supercomputer up to OpenAI's offices in San Francisco's Mission District. The $300,000 machine had cost Nvidia \"a few billion dollars\" to develop, and there were no other buyers, Huang recalled recently on Joe Rogan's podcast.  Musk, at OpenAI, was the only one who wanted it.When Musk told him it was for \"a nonprofit company,\" Huang said all the blood drained from his face at the thought of parking such a costly box inside an organization that wasn't meant to make money.Behind the scenes, though, the nonprofit ideal was already under intense strain, and Musk didn't like what he saw. \"Guys, I've had enough. This is the final straw,\" Musk wrote in an email to his co-founders in 2017. He warned that he would \"no longer fund OpenAI\" if it turned into a tech startup instead of a nonprofit. Altman wrote back the next morning: \"i remain enthusiastic about the non-profit structure!\"Altman vs. MuskIn February of the following year, Musk left the OpenAI board, and said at the time the move was to avoid a potential conflict of interest as his car company, Tesla, dove deeper into AI. The story was more complicated.Musk sued OpenAI and Altman in early 2024, alleging they abandoned the company's founding mission to develop AI \"for the benefit of humanity broadly,\" and he's regularly criticized OpenAI's close ties to Microsoft, its principal backer. He also went to court to try and keep OpenAI from converting into a for-profit entity and, earlier this year, went so far as to try and acquire the AI lab for $97.4 billion. In October, OpenAI announced it had completed a recapitalization, cementing its structure as a nonprofit with a controlling stake in its for-profit business, which is now a public benefit corporation called OpenAI Group PBC.watch nowMusk isn't the only early OpenAI team member who's turned into a bitter rival. Siblings Dario and Daniela Amodei left OpenAI in late 2020 to form Anthropic, which said last month that Microsoft and Nvidia would invest in the company. The valuation from the funding round could reach as high as $350 billion.Anthropic's Claude family of large language models is one of the biggest competitors to OpenAI's GPT models. Altman is wagering that he can win the race by outspending the competition. While his company has sketched out plans for a trillion-dollar-plus AI infrastructure outlay, Anthropic has made roughly $100 billion in recent compute commitments, spaced out at various intervals over the next few years.It all amounts to a giant bet that demand for AI services will continue apace. \"We've got all the various AI vendors making these huge capital investments,\" said David Menninger, executive director of software research at ISG. \"There's a question as to how long those capital investments continue and whether or not they all pan out.\"Luria says Anthropic and others are making reasonable commitments based on their current growth trajectory and the funding they've already secured. But he said OpenAI's approach has been based on a \"fantastical set of commitments\" with a \"faint belief that those numbers are even possible.\" 'Pretty extreme'Altman told CNBC in an interview on Thursday that OpenAI is already seeing enough demand to justify its spending plans, which \"makes us confident that we will be able to significantly ramp revenue.\"\"It's obviously unusual to be growing this fast at this kind of scale, but it is what we see in our current data,\" Altman said, adding that \"the demand in the market is pretty extreme.\" Altman said last month that he expects annualized revenue to hit $20 billion by the end of this year and to reach hundreds of billions by 2030. Its historic pace of growth has been a big boon for major tech companies. Oracle signed a roughly $500 billion deal to sell infrastructure services to OpenAI over five years. Chipmakers Advanced Micro Devices and Broadcom have woven OpenAI-linked demand into multi-year forecasts. But Oracle's shares plunged 11% on Thursday after the software vendor reported weaker-than-expected revenue, a miss that dragged down Nvidia, CoreWeave and other AI-related stocks. Despite a surge in long-term contract commitments from companies like OpenAI, Meta, and Nvidia, investors are growing concerned about Oracle's debt load that's fueling its buildout. watch nowStill, venture capitalist Matt Murphy of Menlo Ventures, said that in his 25 years in the venture business, \"this is the mother of all waves.\"Murphy, an early investor in Anthropic, said the combination of AI models, custom chips and hyperscale data centers adds up to the potential for trillion-dollar outcomes. That explains the eye-popping level of capital expenditures and the astronomical valuations, he said.Altman recently declared a \"code red\" inside his company, and shuffled resources to focus on making ChatGPT faster, more reliable and more personal, while delaying work on ads, health and shopping agents and a personal assistant called Pulse. His declaration came after Google released its Gemini 3 model last month, further accelerating the search giant's ascent in the market. On Thursday, OpenAI unveiled ChatGPT-5.2, a faster, more capable reasoning model that the company says is its best system yet for everyday professional use. It also struck a three-year, $1 billion content and equity deal with Disney around the Sora AI video generator.Altman downplayed the threat from Google, telling CNBC that Gemini had less of an impact on the company's metrics than OpenAI initially feared. \"I believe that when a competitive threat happens, you want to focus on it, deal with it quickly,\" Altman said.He said he expects the company to exit code red by January.— CNBC's Kif Leswing contributed to this report.watch now",

The back of the coin would showcase imagery similar to that captured of Trump after the assassination attempt against him last year.A Treasury spokesperson told CNBC in October that a final design for a $1 coin had not yet be chosen. As of Thursday, the Mint's list of contenders included three designs for the \"heads\" side all featuring Trump.",

As part of the startup's new three-year licensing agreement with Disney, Sora users will be able make content with more than 200 characters across Disney, Marvel, Pixar and Star Wars starting next year. \"The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence marks an important moment for our industry, and through this collaboration with OpenAI we will thoughtfully and responsibly extend the reach of our storytelling through generative AI, while respecting and protecting creators and their works,\" Disney CEO Bob Iger said in a statement.As part of the agreement, Disney said it will receive warrants to purchase additional equity and will become a major OpenAI customer. Disney is deploying OpenAI's chatbot, ChatGPT, to its employees and will work with its technology to build new tools and experiences, according to a release. When Sora launched this fall, the app rocketed to the top of Apple's App Store and generated a storm of controversy as users flooded the platform with videos of popular brands and characters. The Motion Picture Association said in October that OpenAI needed to take \"immediate and decisive action\" to prevent copyright infringement on Sora. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said more \"granular control\" over character generation was coming, according to a blog post following the launch.Disney CEO Bob Iger and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman appearing on CNBC on Dec. 11th, 2025.CNBCAs AI startups have rapidly changed the way that people can interact with content online, media companies, including Disney, have kicked off a series of fresh legal battles to try and protect their intellectual property.Disney sent a cease and desist letter to Google late on Wednesday alleging the company infringed its copyrights on a \"massive scale.\" In the letter, which was viewed by CNBC, Disney said Google has been using its copyrighted works to train models and distributing copies of its protected content without authorization.CNBC has reached out to Google for comment on the letter.Universal and Disney have sued the AI image creator Midjourney, alleging that the company improperly used and distributed AI-generated characters from their movies.

Brittany Hosea-small | ReutersBroadcom reported fourth-quarter results that beat expectations for earnings and revenue, and issued a strong forecast for the current quarter, driven by artificial intelligence demand. The stock initially rose in extended trading before declining more than 2%. Here's how the company did, compared with estimates from analysts polled by LSEG:Earnings per share: $1.95 adjusted vs. $1.86 estimatedRevenue: $18.02 billion vs. $17.49 billion estimatedBroadcom said revenue in the fiscal first quarter will be about $19.1 billion, which would represent 28% year-over-year growth, and is higher than the $18.3 billion average analyst estimate, according to LSEG.CEO Hock Tan said in a statement that Broadcom expects AI chip sales this quarter to double from a year earlier to $8.2 billion, both from custom AI chips as well as semiconductors for AI networking. Net income climbed 97% to $8.51 billion, or $1.74 per share, from $4.32 billion, or 90 cents per share, in the year-ago period. Along with Nvidia, Broadcom has been the other major winner among U.S. semiconductor companies due to the AI boom. The company's stock price is up 75% so far in 2025, after doubling last year, as its custom chips, such as Google's tensor processing units, are gaining increasing traction in the market as a rival to Nvidia's graphics processing units.On an earnings call with analysts, the company said it had acquired a fifth customer for its custom chips, and revealed that Anthropic was the previously unnamed customer which had placed a $10 billion order for Google's TPUs during the quarter. In June, Broadcom said it had three customers and four prospects for its custom AI chips. In September, it said it had a fourth mystery customer who had placed a $10 billion order for custom chips, and separately, announced a partnership with OpenAI in October to develop custom chips. Investors are closely watching to see Broadcom confirm that those companies are continuing to engage and are on-track to buy and deploy custom chips. Anthropic is using the latest Google TPU called Ironwood, Tan said on a earnings call with analysts.Tan said that Broadcom's other customers \"prefer to control their own destiny by continuing to drive their multiyear journey to create their own custom AI accelerators, or XPUs, as we call them.\"He said that Broadcom had added a 5th customer for custom chips, which had placed a $1 billion order expected to be delivered in late 2026. Broadcom has a $73 billion backlog for custom chips, switches, and other data center parts for AI over the next 18 months, Tan said. Broadcom's overall revenue grew 28% during the quarter, which the company attributed largely to a 74% increase in AI chip sales, which would be equivalent to $8.2 billion in AI revenue during the fourth quarter.AI chip sales are reported in the company's semiconductor solutions business, which reported $11.07 billion in sales, up 22% on an annual basis, and topping StreetAccount's $10.77 billion estimate. Broadcom's other major segment, infrastructure software, reported 26% growth to $6.94 billion in sales, topping Wall Street's expectations. The segment includes sales from the company's VMWare offerings. Broadcom said that it would issue a per-share dividend of 65 cents, payable later this month, up from 59 cents.

    "body": "Gen. David Petraeus, Former CIA Director, Fmr. Central Commander and American commander in Iraq.Adam Jeffery | CNBCThe White House's new national security strategy gave Europe a scare last week as it warned the region faced \"civilizational erasure\" and questioned whether it could remain a geopolitical partner for America. The document shocked allies on the continent as it criticized its leaders as \"weak\" and slammed the region's stance on immigration, democracy, freedom of speech, while adding its waning economic and military power was waning.\"It is far from obvious whether certain European countries will have economies and militaries strong enough to remain reliable allies,\" it said, adding that the region suffered from a lack of self-confidence. The document also called for the U.S. to re-establish \"strategic stability\" with Russia, despite its war against Ukraine.But David Petraeus, the former CIA Director and four-star US Army general, told CNBC it was no bad thing for European nations to get a wake-up call to look after their defense and security. The strategy was, \"in a way, going after the Europeans but, frankly, some of the Europeans needed to be gotten after because I watched as four different presidents tried to exhort the Europeans to do more for their own defence and now that's actually happening,\" he told CNBC's Dan Murphy in Abu Dhabi on Thursday.Petraeus said President Donald Trump had been \"very, very substantial\" in getting the Europeans to spend more on defense.\"He's gotten them to commit to what they should have done years ago,\" Petraeus said. He pointed to European members of NATO agreeing earlier this year to increase defense spending to 5% of their gross domestic product, after sustained pressure from the Trump administration.'Putin is not going to budge'Petraeus' comments come as diplomatic efforts continue to end the war in Ukraine, with U.S. officials holding talks regarding peace proposals with Russian and Ukrainian counterparts in recent weeks. Both Russia and Ukraine, and its European allies, have promoted different peace plans with contradictory demands and \"red lines.\" The biggest obstacles to peace remain disagreements over post-war security guarantees for Ukraine and Russian demands that Kyiv cede the eastern region of Donbas.Washington is reportedly urging both sides to come to an agreement before Christmas, but there is also skepticism that this is possible. Russia, meanwhile, appears to be enjoying the increasing pressure that Europe and Ukraine are coming under from Washington.Petraeus said he had little faith that Russia could compromise over a peace plan with Putin showing little sign of compromise over war objectives such as territorial control, regime change, and a \"demilitarized\" Ukraine with no prospect of NATO membership.\"I'm encouraged that there is an effort spurred by the United States and backed by President Trump, personally, in many respects, and his direct negotiators to try to bring the war to an end. I'm not encouraged by Moscow's response,\" Petraeus said. \"Vladimir Putin just continues to reiterate that his goals are the maximalist objectives he's held all along, which essentially denies independence to Ukraine. He wants to get a pro-Russian president to replace President Zelenskyy ... He wants to demilitarize Ukraine [and] ... he wants to be given ground that is in the most fortified area of Ukraine,\" he added. Putin \"is not going to budge,\" Petraeus added.Frozen assetsUkraine's European allies have been looking at ways to continue funding its war against Russia, as well as considering its eventual post-war reconstruction, which is likely to cost over $500 billion, according to the United Nations, and Russian reparations.The EU is believed to be close to a deal to mobilize a sizable chunk of the estimated 210 billion euros (around $244 billion) worth of Russian sovereign assets currently frozen in European financial institutions. President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy meets with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte, President of the European Council Antonio Costa, and President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen in Brussels, Belgium on Dec. 9, 2025.Ukrainian Presidency | Anadolu | Getty ImagesThere are, however, concerns over the legal ramifications and the potential retaliation from Moscow; Russia's security council chief warned last week that using Russian assets would be tantamount to a justification for war.Petraeus said if the EU did go ahead with using frozen Russian reserves, it would be a \"game changer.\"\"We've heard a lot of game changers before. I've never bought into those. But ... $200 billion or even 100 billion euros of money for Ukraine would be a game changer. It solves their fiscal and economic problems for a couple of years,\" he said.",

    "body": "Renovation work continues on the Marriner S. Eccles Federal Reserve Board Building, the main offices of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System on December 9, 2025 in Washington, DC. Andrew Harnik | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesThe Federal Reserve on Thursday reappointed 11 of its 12 regional bank presidents, ending a mini-drama at the central bank in a move that came a bit earlier than usual.By unanimous vote, the seven governors kept in place a cast of officials that also includes first vice presidents at the branches that extend across the country. The group of presidents did not include the Atlanta Fed, whose president, Raphael Bostic, is retiring in February. Though the regional reserve banks act independently and hire their own presidents, the moves are subject to board approval in Washington, D.C. The presidents serve five-year terms, which in this case will commence March 1, 2026, and can be removed at will by the board.Normally, the Fed waits until closer to the Feb. 28 expiration date of the terms to announce reappointments. The terms historically have ended in years ending in one or six.There had been some speculation about whether President Donald Trump, a fierce Fed critic, would seek to exert more control over the rate-setting process by removing some regional presidents. The Federal Open Market Committee sets the central bank's key interest rate with a voting group that includes the chair, the other six governors, the New York Fed president and a rotating cast of four other regional presidents.However, the unanimous vote included Governor Stephen Miran, a recent Trump appointee whose term expires in January.Moreover, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent recently complained that New York holds disproportionate sway over the Fed as several presidents are from the city but serving in other areas. They include Lorie Logan, who previously ran the trading desk at the New York Fed and now helms the Dallas distrct, and former Goldman Sachs executive Beth Hammack, who is in Cleveland.Bessent floated a proposal in which regional presidents would be required to be residents of their district for three years.

    "body": "The U.S. Capitol dome is illuminated as the House of Representatives returns to Washington to vote to reopen the government Wednesday, Nov. 12, 2025.Bill Clark | CQ-Roll Call, Inc. | Getty ImagesPrivate markets could get an influx of capital and investors under legislation approved by the House on ThursdayThe package of capital-formation bills, called the INVEST Act, passed the House 302 to 123. Eighty-seven Democrats joined every Republican in the House to support the bill. The wide-ranging package of legislation would allow more investors access to private markets. Lawmakers say the measure will help more companies go public and increase capital formation for startups.Instead of only wealth or income determining who can be an accredited investor, investors could become accredited by taking an exam approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission.House Financial Services Chairman French Hill, R-Ark., said the bill was needed in part because of the decrease in the number of public companies in America. \"We make it easier to be a public company in America,\" Hill said on the House floor during debate on the bill. \"\"We make it easier, if you have a great idea, to crowdsource that idea, to raise money from friends and family. And we make it easier, if you're an individual investor, to have other opportunities in which to invest.\"The bill also would lift the cap for how much venture capital firms can raise, and how many people can invest, before they are subject to stricter disclosure and compliance regulations.The bill increases the number of investors to 500 from 250, and increases funds to $50 million from $10 million. It also would become easier for venture capital firms to invest in each other  — a change lawmakers say will help more funds reach companies in places like the Midwest and the South. Rep. Bill Huizenga, R-Mich., said that unicorn companies  — privately held startups with a valuation of $1 billion or more  — used to be rare. Now, he said there are \"herds of unicorns\" which limit investing opportunities for the public. \"We're trying to make sure that this is open and accessible to folks, and I think that's going to be a healthier approach for both the public markets and the private markets,\" Huizenga said. The bill now heads to the Senate, where making capital formation easier is on Banking Committee Chair Tim Scott's to-do list. It is not clear if the Senate will take up the House package, move individual pieces of it, or try to do its own bill. ",

    "body": "Calvin McDonald, CEO of lululemon athletica inc., is interviewed by CNBC on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York City, U.S., March 29, 2023. Brendan Mcdermid | ReutersLululemon announced Thursday its CEO Calvin McDonald will step down effective Jan. 31 following more than a year of underperformance at the athleisure company. The company's board of directors is working with a \"leading executive search firm\" to identify its next CEO, it said in a news release. McDonald will stay on as a senior advisor through March 31. \"The timing is right for a change,\" McDonald said on a call with analysts, \"I've described being CEO of Lululemon as my dream job. It truly has lived up to every expectation and given me the opportunity of a lifetime.\"Lululemon's CFO Meghan Frank and Chief Commercial Officer André Maestrini will serve as interim co-CEOs during the search process. The company's board chair Marti Morfitt will also take on the expanded role of executive chair. In a statement, she said the company has a strong foundation in place but needs a new leader that can guide it through a transition.\"As we look to the future, the Board is focused on identifying a leader with a track record of driving companies through periods of growth and transformation to guide the company's next chapter of success,\" said Morfitt.Shares rose about 10% in extended trading. The leadership change follows more than a year of underperformance at Lululemon and calls for change from its founder and its largest independent shareholder Chip Wilson. Two months ago, he took out a full page ad in the Wall Street Journal saying the company is \"in a nosedive\" and it needed to \"stop chasing Wall Street at the expense of customers.\" Lululemon announced McDonald's departure on the same day it posted fiscal third-quarter earnings and another round of weak guidance. Here's how the company did compared with what Wall Street was anticipating, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:Earnings per share: $2.59 vs. $2.25 expectedRevenue: $2.57 billion vs. $2.48 billion expectedThe company's reported net income for the three-month period that ended Nov. 2 was $306.84 million, or $2.59 per share, compared with $351.87 million, or $2.87 per share, a year earlier. Sales rose to $2.57 billion, up from $2.40 billion a year earlier. For Lululemon's current quarter, McDonald said the company is \"encouraged\" by its early performance so far this holiday season — though guidance fell short of Wall Street estimates. It anticipates sales will be between $3.50 billion and $3.59 billion, largely below expectations of $3.60 billion, according to LSEG. It's expecting earnings per share to be between $4.66 and $4.76, well short of expectations of $5.03, according to LSEG. In the previous two quarters, Lululemon cut its full-year guidance. On Thursday, more than a month into the final quarter of the year, it raised its full-year expectations. It now anticipates sales will be between $10.96 billion and $11.05 billion, in line with expectations at the low end, according to LSEG. It expects earnings per share to be between $12.92 and $13.02, roughly in line with estimates of about $13, according to LSEG. The company saw strong demand during its Thanksgiving weekend, which allowed it to clear through stale inventory at a discount, said McDonald. \"I also want to acknowledge we've seen trends slow a bit since Thanksgiving, which we've taken into account in our Q4 guidance,\" said McDonald. \"However, despite this, we expect revenue trends in the U.S. and Q4 to be modestly improved relative to Q3.\" Lululemon's business has been under pressure over the last year as it navigates the impact of tariffs, a shaky U.S. consumer and a product assortment that's failed to wow shoppers in the same way it once did. It's also facing steep competition in the athleisure space from upstarts like Vuori and Alo Yoga as well as a change in consumer preferences. Instead of yoga pants, these days many shoppers are reaching for denim. To drive growth and reach a wider audience, Lululemon has been working to expand its business internationally and offer shoppers a wider assortment. Instead of just workout gear, Lululemon has expanded into shoes, outerwear like coats and jackets and casual pants that can be worn at work. The company's overall business is growing, but the expansion has largely come from its international business and new store openings. Its largest market, the Americas, has been declining. During the quarter, revenue in the Americas decreased 2%, with comparable sales down 5%, while international sales jumped 33%. Comparable sales abroad increased 18%. Lululemon is also being hit by the end of the de minimis exemption, which allowed low value packages to enter the U.S. duty free, a bit more acutely than its peers. In September, it said it expects tariffs to hit its full year profits by $240 million and most of those costs will come from the de minimis exemption ending. Following progress with vendor negotiations and other mitigation efforts, it now expects tariffs to reduce its profits by $210 million.

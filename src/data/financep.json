    "body": "File: President Donald Trump looks on after signing an executive order in the Oval Office of the White House on April 9, 2025.Saul Loeb | Afp | Getty ImagesA company controlled by a Chinese national was ordered by U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday to unwind a $2.9 million acquisition of chip assets from a U.S. manufacturer, citing national security concerns.The White House said in an executive order that HieFo Corporation, incorporated in Delaware, was \"controlled by a citizen of the People's Republic of China.\"HieFo acquired the digital chips and related wafer design, fabrication, and processing businesses of New Jersey-based Emcore on April 30, 2024, which included a semiconductor manufacturing facility, the Treasury Department said in a separate statement.The potential diversion of the supply of indium phosphide chips manufactured by Emcore's digital chips business away from the U.S. was also identified as a national security risk, the Treasury Department added.HieFo and Emcore did not immediately respond to a CNBC request for comment.The Global Times, a Chinese government mouthpiece, citing an expert, said the divestment order \"reflects Washington's anxiety over technology competition with China\" as it was made without a convincing rationale.The Treasury Department said the deal was not notified to the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, known as CFIUS, prompting a review by its non-notified transactions team.\"CFIUS identified a national security risk arising from the transaction relating to potential access to EMCORE's intellectual property, proprietary know-how, and expertise,\" the Treasury Department said.HieFo was ordered to divest all acquired assets within 180 days and to immediately restrict access to Emcore's technical information.In a statement dated Sept. 2, 2024, HieFo said the deal would allow operations to continue at Emcore's facility in Alhambra, California, and that it had \"successfully engaged\" nearly all key scientists, engineers and operational staff.HieFo was founded by Genzao Zhang and Harry Moore through a management buyout of wafer fabrication and chip-related assets from Emcore. Both founders list their start dates at HieFo as May 2024 on LinkedIn, when the acquisition closed.The company claimed it had inherited more than 40 years of optoelectronic innovation in indium phosphide chip manufacturing.Emcore manufactures navigation equipment such as gyroscopes and sensors used in commercial, industrial and defense applications, including autonomous navigation and weapons systems, according to its website.The company was delisted from Nasdaq in early 2025 following its merger with aerospace manufacturing holding company Velocity One LP in November 2024.",

    "body": "watch nowWarren Buffett said Berkshire Hathaway is better positioned than any company to endure over the long term as he handed over the CEO reins to his successor Greg Abel, whom he strongly endorsed. \"It has a better chance I think of being here 100 years from now than any company I can think of,\" Buffett told Becky Quick in a special interview, parts of which aired on CNBC Friday.The full interview with Buffett will air on CNBC Tuesday, Jan. 13 at 7 p.m. ET.Buffett officially relinquished the CEO role to Abel Thursday, ending a six-decade legendary run at the helm that turned a struggling textile mill into a trillion-dollar conglomerate with varied businesses from insurance companies to railroads with over $300 billion in cash on the balance sheet. \"Greg will be the decider,\" Buffett said. I \"can't imagine how much more he can get accomplished in a week than I can in a month....I'd rather have Greg handling my money than any of the top investment advisors or any of the top CEOs in the United States.\"Berkshire shares trailed the market after Buffett announced in May he was retiring as some investors questioned whether Abel could manage the sprawling collection of businesses, along with an equity portfolio, in a similar fashion as Buffett, while commanding a premium valuation from the market.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconBerkshire B shares, 1 yearBuffett, who will remain chairman, noted that Abel is a sensible leader, who, like him, lives a normal life away from the spotlight.\"He's not a distorted individual. You know, I mean, he likes to play ice hockey with his kids,\" he said. \"If the neighbors didn't know who he was, they wouldn't have any idea that on Jan. 1, he's going to be the decider on a company that employs close to 400,000 people, and has got plans to be around 50 or 100 years from now.\"The 95-year-old investor also signaled a quieter public role going forward, saying he will not take the stage at Berkshire's annual shareholder meeting this year, a notable shift from a tradition that has drawn tens of thousands of investors to Omaha for decades.\"Everything will be the same,\" Buffett said. \"I will come in. I won't be up there speaking at the annual meeting, but I'll be in the directors' section.\"",

    "body": "21 December 2025, Venezuela, Puerto Cabello: View of the El Palito refinery of the Venezuelan state oil company PDVSA from the El Faro district.Jesus Vargas | Picture Alliance | Getty ImagesPresident Donald Trump's overthrow of President Nicolas Maduro in oil-rich Venezuela is unlikely to shock energy markets in the near term, analysts told CNBC on Saturday. While the scale of the U.S. attack was unexpected, markets had already priced in a conflict with Venezuela that would disrupt oil exports, said Arne Lohmann Rasmussen, chief analyst and head of research at A/S Global Risk Management.Venezuela, a founding member of OPEC, has the largest proven oil reserves in the world. But the South American nation currently produces less than a million oil barrels a day, which is less than 1% of global oil production, according to Rasmussen. It exports just about half its production, or some 500,000 barrels, Rasmussen said. The conflict also comes as the global oil market is oversupplied and demand is relatively weak, a pattern that is customary in the first quarter of the year, he said.Rasmussen estimated that Brent crude prices will only rise by about $1 to $2, or even less, when futures trading opens on Sunday night. He projected that Brent will edge lower next week than where it closed on Friday, which was $60.75.\"Despite this being a huge geopolitical event that you would normally expect to be positive or push up oil prices,\" he said, \"the bottom line is there's still too much oil in the market, and that's why oil prices will not go ballistic.\"Analyst Bob McNally of Rapidan Energy said he was advising clients before the weekend that about a third of Venezuela's oil production was at risk. While he does not predict that all of Venezuela's output would be cut off, he told CNBC that it would not pose a meaningful risk to oil markets in the short term. The oil market in 2025 posted its biggest annual decline in five years. The global benchmark Brent fell about 19% last year, while U.S. crude oil lost nearly 20%.The market has been under pressure as OPEC+ ramped up production after years of output cuts. The U.S. also produced at a record level of just over 13.8 million barrels per day.Oil prices may decline further as the regime overthrow raises the possibility of eventually boosting oil production in Venezuela, analysts told CNBC. Saul Kavonic, head of energy research at MST Financial, estimated that exports could approach 3 million barrels in the medium term if a new Venezuelan government led to the lifting of sanctions and the return of foreign investors. \"If anything, the future of Venezuela will have a bearish impact on the market, because there's really nowhere to go but up,\" said energy industry consultant David Goldwyn, a former top State Department energy official in the Obama administration.Currently, the embargo on Venezuelan oil is still in effect, Trump said during a press conference Saturday. He also said that U.S. oil companies will invest billions of dollars to rebuild Venezuela's energy sector. Trump did not provide details on which companies would invest or how, nor did he clarify how the U.S. would temporarily run Venezuela \"with a group.\"Goldwyn said it is hard to predict whether U.S. oil companies will invest, given the uncertainty about the interim and future governments in Venezuela. \"Everything we have learned about government transitions from Iraq, from Afghanistan, from other countries, is that transitions are hard,\" he said. \"No company is going to want to commit to invest billions of dollars for a long-term operation until they know what the terms are. And they can't know what the terms are until you know what the government is going to be.\"Goldwyn added that companies, including Exxon Mobil, are still waiting to collect on debt owed by Venezuela's national oil company, Petróleos de Venezuela S.A. (PDVSA). Rapidan Energy's McNally said it is a complicated proposition for U.S. oil companies. Oil producers have not forgotten being kicked out of Venezuela in the early 2000s, when the country expropriated the assets of foreign oil companies, he said. That said, accessing the world's largest oil reserves would be \"tantalizing\" to U.S. oil companies if sanctions were lifted, he added.But it would take decades of investment and billions of dollars, McNally said. Whether it's worth it comes down to one central question, he said: Does the world need that much oil?\"Until late last year, the market consensus had been that demand for oil is going to stop growing in four years. It's over because of EVs and fuel efficiency policies and climate change policies,\" McNally said.But as the U.S. and other nations, including China and Canada, weaken their climate policies and sales of electric vehicles fall, the prospect of investing in Venezuela has become much more attractive. \"All of a sudden you're starting to say: \"Whoa, we're going to need more oil,\" he said. — Additional reporting contributed by CNBC's Victor Loh",

In addition to Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, the indictment also charges Maduro's son, Nicolas Ernesto Maduoro Guerra, Diosado Cabello Rondon, Ramon Rodriguez Chachin, and Hector Rusthenford Guerrero Flores. Read the indictment here.\"Nicolas Maduro Moros, the defendant, now sits atop a corrupt, illegitimate government that, for decades, has leveraged government power to protect and promote illegal activity, including drug trafficking,\" the indictment said.\"That drug trafficking has enriched and entrenched Venezuela's political and military elite, including Minister of the Interior, Justice and Peace Diosado Cabello Rondon, the defendant, and former  Minister of the Interior and Justice Ramon Rodriguez Chachin, the defendant.\"Guerrero was identified as the leader of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua.In addition to the narco-terrorism conspiracy charge, the indictment alleges four other criminal counts: cocaine importation conspiracy; possession of machine guns and destructive devices; and conspiracy to possess machine guns and destructive devices.Rep. Thomas Massie, a Kentucky Republican, blasted the attack on Venezuela and its rationale\"If this action were constitutionally sound, the Attorney General wouldn't be tweeting that they've arrested the President of a sovereign country and his wife for possessing guns in violation of a 1934 U.S. firearm law,\" Massie wrote in a post on the social media site X.",

Protests began on December 28, 2025, with Tehran shopkeepers rallying against Iran's worsening economy have spread to other cities, drawing in students as well. (Photo by ATTA KENARE / AFP via Getty Images)Atta Kenare | Afp | Getty ImagesPresident Donald Trump said Friday that if Iran \"violently\" intervenes with peaceful protests, then the U.S. will \"come to their rescue.\"Unrest has been growing in Iran since last week, as protests erupted over the government's handling of a sharp fall in the nation's currency and soaring prices. Annual inflation hit 42.2% in December, with food prices jumping 72%. The protests turned violent this week as local media reported the death of at least six civilians.\"If Iran shots and violently kills peaceful protesters, which is their custom, the United States of America will come to their rescue,\" Trump wrote in a post on Truth Social on Friday.\"We are locked and loaded and ready to go,\" he added.Iran's supreme leader adviser Ali Larijani responded by saying that U.S. interference in Iran's protests was equivalent to chaos across the entire region on Friday, in comments reported by Reuters.watch nowSuzanne Maloney, vice president and director of foreign policy at the Brookings Institution, previously said that the Iranian people were calling for not just a fix to the economy, but for regime change. She added that Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has been in power for 36 years.\"We're hearing cries of Death to the dictator. We're hearing slogans that juxtapose the regime's support for militia groups across the region with the real interests and demands of the Iranian people,\" Maloney told CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" on Wednesday.Iran's economy has struggled since Trump pulled the U.S. out of the Iranian nuclear deal in 2018 and re-imposed sanctions on the country. Last year in June, U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear sites escalated tensions, pulling Washington into Israel's war with its longtime regional rival.Earlier this week, Trump threatened additional military action against Iran if the country attempts to build up its reserves of ballistic weapons and reestablish its nuclear program.\"Now, I hear that Iran is trying to build up again, and if they are we're going to have to knock them down. We'll knock them down. We'll knock the hell out of them. But hopefully that's not happening,\" Trump said on Monday.Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian responded on Tuesday in a post on X, saying that the response of the Islamic Republic of Iran to any \"oppressive aggression will be harsh and regrettable.\"  Foreign policy has dominated Trump's schedule in recent weeks. On Tuesday, the U.S. announced sanctions on a group of 10 individuals and entities based in Iran and Venezuela that are allegedly linked to the weapons trade between the two countries.— CNBC's Justin Papp contributed to this report.",

    "body": "Ken Griffin, founder and CEO of Citadel, speaks to the Economic Club of New York at The Plaza Hotel in New York, Nov. 21, 2024.Brendan Mcdermid | ReutersBillionaire investor Ken Griffin's flagship hedge fund at Citadel climbed double digits in 2025, navigating a volatile year marked by sharp market swings, trade tensions and a late-year rebound in risk assets.Citadel's flagship multistrategy Wellington fund, its largest, gained 10.2% in 2025, according to a person familiar with the firm's returns who asked to remain anonymous as the information is private. The firm's tactical trading fund, which blends equities with quantitative strategies, rose 18.6% in 2025, the person said. Citadel's fundamental equity strategy returned 14.5%, while its global fixed income fund advanced 9.4%.Citadel declined to comment. The S&P 500 locked in a 16.4% gain for the year, its third straight double-digit annual advance. That marks an impressive recovery from the rout seen in early April following President Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs announcement. At one point, the S&P 500 was even on the cusp of closing in bear market territory.The hedge fund plans to return about $5 billion of profits earned this year to clients in an effort to limit capital growth, CNBC's Leslie Picker previously reported. The move is expected to reduce assets under management to about $67 billion from roughly $72 billion.Wellington's long-term track record remains strong as the fund has generated an annualized return of 19% since its inception in 1990, the person said.",

    "body": "U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell holds a press conference following a two-day meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee at the U.S. Federal Reserve in Washington, Dec. 10, 2025.Kevin Lamarque | ReutersThe Federal Reserve heads into 2026 facing a slew of political and policy challenges, headlined by a new chair and an economy fed by both tailwinds and headwinds that will make policymakers' choices all the more important.Coming off three consecutive interest rate cuts, the central bank is expected to follow a more tepid path for the year ahead in which additional cuts could be hard to come by considering expectations for solid growth and ongoing inflation pressures.One thing does seem certain: After a year of extraordinary upheaval surrounding the Fed, 2026 looks to offer more of the same.\"I do think there'll be a big spotlight. There'll be lots of intrigue,\" said Kathy Bostjancic, chief economist at Nationwide. \"There's still a lot of uncertainty that keeps the Fed in the spotlight, and probably in the hot seat too.\"The previous year saw the Fed come under that spotlight in ways that it never had before.As he started his second term at the White House, President Donald Trump repeatedly threatened to fire Fed Chair Jerome Powell for not being quicker to push for interest rate cuts. Around mid-year, the Fed came under fire again, this time for cost overruns at a renovation project it had undertaken at its Washington headquarters.In between, Trump tried to remove Governor Lisa Cook over allegations — as yet unproven and not even brought as formal charges — that she committed mortgage fraud. That all came against a backdrop of who would succeed Powell as chair when his term expires in May, with as many as 11 candidates considered during an interview process led by Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. If all that sounds exhausting, consider that 2026 begins with a Supreme Court hearing scheduled for Jan. 21 to decide whether Trump has the authority to remove Cook. A week later, the Federal Open Market Committee holds its interest rate vote. At some point during the month, Trump is expected to unveil his choice for Fed chair. And Powell, cagey on the issue so far, also will have to disclose whether he plans on serving out his term on the Board of Governors that runs until January 2028.There also have been multiple dissents at recent rate votes, and new regional presidents set to come on board at the FOMC have a hawkish bent, meaning they're likely to resist additional cuts.\"It's still a tough spot for the Fed,\" Bostjancic said.Focus on policyStill, when it comes to policy, most on Wall Street expect the Fed to put the noise in the background and continue down the road of lowering its benchmark interest rate just a bit more until it gets closer to a neutral level around 3%. Neutral is considered a spot that neither boosts nor holds back economic activity, and the funds rate is just half a percentage point above where most on the FOMC see the rate landing over the long term.\"Chair Powell helped orchestrate three 25-basis-point rate cuts in a row. It's not as if he was standing in the way of the FOMC cutting rates,\" Bostjancic said. As far as further cuts go, \"For us, it's [about] the economic data.\"Bostjancic sees the data pointing to two cuts this year, one around mid-year and another toward the end. The Fed's \"dot plot\" grid of expectations indicates just one cut, while outliers such as Moody's Analytics chief economist Mark Zandi and Citigroup seeing labor market weakness pointing to three.Powell and his colleagues have stood by the notion that they won't be bullied into cuts and indeed will be guided by data.Torsten Slok, chief economist at Apollo Global Management, thinks the economy will be too strong for the Fed to cut much more, seeing just one reduction ahead.\"The issue is that the winds are really changing for the U.S. economy,\" Slok said during a CNBC interview Friday.Whereas 2025 saw headwinds of tariffs, inflation and a general air of uncertainty, fiscal stimulus and a stabilizing labor market will be pushing on growth, he said.\"It is, in my view, looking like more that the tailwinds are beginning to accumulate and making it more difficult for the Fed to cut rates this year,\" Slok added.The role of AIOne wildcard will be the role that artificial intelligence plays on economic growth.Seen as both a productivity enhancer and a potential impediment to hiring, assessing the impact AI is having on the economy will be paramount for the Fed, said Joseph Brusuelas, chief economist at RSM.\"The Fed this year has got a real challenge in terms of communicating their strategy,\" Brusuelas said. \"We have this massive investment flowing into very sophisticated technologies, and the Federal Reserve is going to need to communicate their basic view on what this means.\"After sputtering at the beginning of 2026, the economy grew rapidly in the middle two quarters and is on pace to accelerate at a 3% pace in the fourth quarter, according to preliminary data from the Atlanta Fed.In addition to helping push along the broader economy, AI-related stocks were a key highlight of another stellar year on Wall Street that saw major averages post double-digit increases.Calibrating monetary policy in that kind of environment will be tough, Brusuelas said.\"They're going to need to provide strategic direction for the central bank at a time when the economy is clearly pivoting towards the integration of this sophisticated technology in the production of goods and provision of services,\" he said. \"This is a really big potential pivot around policy that needs to happen.\"",

    "body": "Trader Peter Tuchman wears \"2026\" glasses as traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange at the opening bell on Dec. 31, 2025.Timothy A. Clary | Afp | Getty ImagesThe new year is starting off with the stock market looking as split as it did last year. The first trading day of 2026 kicked off Friday, with the stock market as bifurcated as it had been in recent months. Though the S&P 500 started the session higher, carried aloft by semiconductors, it has since sputtered and turned lower as the day wore on. The broad market index was last down by 0.1%. A look inside the S&P 500 shows a major division. Five sectors in the broad market index are higher, led by industrials, energy and utilities that were each higher by more than 1%. Six sectors were lower, led by consumer discretionary and communication services. The day's trading is a continuation of a theme that has gained strength in recent months. While the bull market rally of the last three years has been defined by artificial intelligence, traders, nervous tech stocks will find an uphill climb more difficult in 2026, started rotating into other groups. Indeed, the Nasdaq Composite, known for its heavy exposure toward tech companies, ended last year with two straight months of losses.  Many strategists called for a broadening out of the stock market, with companies more sensitive to the economic cycle taking the mantle from tech to lead the market in 2026. They viewed that as a healthy development to extend the bull market.But that could mean an advance for the overall index is harder to come by. Broadly speaking, according to the 2026 CNBC Market Strategist Survey, Wall Street expects the S&P 500 will climb by roughly 11% in 2026 — a respectable rise that nevertheless falls short of the advance of the last three.Others on the Street are more nervous. On Wednesday, Bank of America strategist Savita Subramanian noted the S&P 500 is expensive, meaning \"risks to the index abound in 2026.\" The strategist's 7,100 year-end target for the S&P 500 is among the lowest of those surveyed. Elsewhere, Adam Parker, founder of Trivariate Research, told CNBC's \"Squawk on the Street\" this past week that the level of optimism on the Street has him nervous for 2026. \"I think the consensus is pretty bullish,\" Parker said. \"You're betting on strong earnings growth, and I don't know if that's as likely.\" Within the tech trade, chip stocks were the lone bright spot. As of midday trading, Nvidia was the only name among the Magnificent Seven companies to rise, up by 1.5%. The VanEck Semiconductor ETF gained nearly 3%. Micron rallied more than 7%, while AMD rose more than 3%. ",

    "body": "Planes line up on the tarmac at LaGuardia Airport on November 10, 2025 in New York City.Spencer Platt | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesFrom Spirit Airlines' fight for survival to American Airlines' planned glow-up, from new international routes and brand-new airport lounges to stingier frequent flyer policies, class divides in the sky will intensify in 2026.Airlines went into 2025 upbeat: Delta Air Lines CEO Ed Bastian forecast a record year for the century-old carrier. But concerns about President Donald Trump's trade war, skittish consumers and an oversupply of domestic seats brought U.S. airfare down and weighed on industry profits.\"It's the airline version of the K-shaped economy. Monetize the top of the K and minimize the shortfall at the bottom,\" said Robert Mann, who has worked at several airlines and is president of aviation consulting firm R.W. Mann & Co. Now, the leaders of the country's biggest airlines are putting even more focus on customers who will pay extra for their tickets in exchange for a little more space or other perks like earlier boarding and access to never-sufficient overhead bin space.The view into American Airlines first-class cabin on a Boeing 737.Leslie Josephs/CNBCThey still face continued problems, like a shortage of air traffic controllers and aging infrastructure. Despite billions of additional federal spending to fix some of the problems, major improvements will take years.Mann said airlines need to do more to improve reliability. U.S. carriers had a 77% on-time rate, according to the Department of Transportation, which defines on-time as arrival within 15 minutes of the schedule.\"When the flight is late or canceled, it doesn't matter if you're at the top of the K or the bottom of the K,\" he said.Here's how the next year is shaping up for the airline industry:Winners take (almost) allThrough the first nine months of the year, Delta and United Airlines accounted for nearly all of U.S. airline profits. It's an industry divide that's been brewing for years, further fueled by a surge in costs and shifting consumer tastes as wealthier travelers have increased their share of overall spending.While the economy has been resilient for the most part, any weakening in 2026 could have an outsize effect on more price-sensitive consumers and, therefore, airlines that are more exposed to coach-class domestic travel, like lower-cost carriers.Those airlines have been making moves of their own. JetBlue Airways, for example, has been shifting its focus to more profitable routes and premium seats. It plans to debut a domestic business class in mid-2026 with seats up at the front of the cabin that are roomier but not quite as elaborate as its top-tier lie-flat Mint suites. Stable faresAirfare will likely remain steady next year over 2025, according to an American Express Global Business Travel forecast in mid-November. Demand has rebounded after dropping during a record-long government shutdown, but it's not clear whether 2026 will be a blockbuster.Southwest Airlines CEO Bob Jordan told CNBC in December that the \"first quarter looks strong\" but that \"it's hard to say,\" whether it will be better than a year ago.Read more CNBC airline newsAmerican Airlines no longer lets basic economy flyers earn milesArchitect of Delta's premium strategy to retire in FebruaryFrontier Airlines replaces longtime CEO Barry Biffle with carrier's presidentSouthwest CEO says airline 'actively pursuing' network of airport loungesWhither SpiritStruggling budget travel icon Spirit Airlines is in its second bankruptcy in less than a year after a court-blocked acquisition by JetBlue, an engine grounding, a surge in costs and other problems, raising questions about its ability to survive. Industry insiders and airline analysts have said the yellow-plane airline will have to make much bigger moves with this bankruptcy.\"We do not expect it to remain a standalone company this time next year, with a merger or Chapter 7 outcome likely to drive upside to our earnings forecast,\" said a Raymond James note on Dec. 19.watch nowAnalysts expect that merger partner would be Frontier Airlines, the fellow budget airline that has attempted to combine with Spirit repeatedly since 2022, but it's not clear whether the two sides will reach a deal. Spirit said earlier this month that it's in \"active negotiations\" for a stand-alone reorganization or a transaction. Frontier and Spirit declined to comment further. Southwest transformedSouthwest's preparing for a major change in 2026. The airline's decades-long cattle call will end on Jan. 27 when assigned seating begins. It's coming off a slew of changes it already put into place last year. It debuted extra legroom seats that command higher prices and started charging many customers to check bags for the first time, a service that brought in more than $7 billion for its U.S. rivals in 2024, the last full year of available data, according to the Transportation Department.The carrier's stock is the top gainer of U.S. passenger airlines. Southwest shares rose nearly 23% in 2025 compared with the NYSE Arca Airline Index's 5% advance, and beat out profit leaders Delta and United as well as the broader market.Investors have been bullish on the company's transformation to a more traditional, segmented airline, which has been sped along by a stake from activist investor Elliott Investment Management.American makeoverAmerican is expanding its lounges and launching a fleet of Airbus 321XLR planes in 2026 as it aims to catch up in the luxury travel boom. Free inflight Wi-Fi is also coming for loyalty program members starting in January, American said last spring.The airline already made more minor changes, like adding Lavazza coffee for all its passengers and Champagne Bollinger for its top-tier lounges and cabins, to uplift its brand as well, but it has a long path to reach Delta's and United's profitability.American Airlines and Delta planes on the tarmac at LaGuardia Airport (LGA) in the Queens borough of New York, US, on Friday, Nov. 7, 2025.Michael Nagle | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesJust before Christmas, American also announced that it will no longer award customers on its no-frills basic economy tickets with frequent flyer miles, following a similar move by Delta several years ago. American hasn't yet announced changes to its elite status requirements for 2027, but the carrier is under pressure because Delta and United have said they will hold status thresholds steady.The airline is also making some changes that aim to improve reliability, recently announcing it will increase so-called banks, or clusters of flights at its largest hub, Dallas Fort Worth International Airport, from nine to 13.American also said it is testing out two electronic gates there, where passengers on narrow-body domestic flights scan their own boarding passes, in hopes of getting travelers on planes faster, and in September, it said it will remove bag sizers from gates.",

    "body": "watch nowTesla posted its fourth-quarter 2025 vehicle production and deliveries report on Friday, marking a second annual decline for Elon Musk's automaker. Shares closed 2.59% lower on the day.Here are the key numbers:Total Q4 deliveries: 418,227 Total Q4 production: 434,358 Total 2025 deliveries: 1.64 millionTotal 2025 production: 1.65 millionWall Street expected 426,000 deliveries for the quarter, according to estimates compiled by StreetAccount. In a company-compiled consensus posted to its website on Dec. 29, Tesla said analysts it surveyed were expecting a 15% drop from a year earlier to 422,850 vehicles.Deliveries for Q4 2025 were about 16% lower than the fourth quarter of 2024, when Musk's EV company reported 495,570. Q4 2025 numbers for production were down 5.5% from a year ago, when Tesla produced 459,445 vehicles.For the full year, Tesla's deliveries fell 8.6% to 1.64 million from 1.79 million in 2024.Tesla said deliveries of its entry-level Model 3 sedan and Model Y SUV amounted to 406,585 in the fourth quarter, or about 97% of total deliveries. Deliveries of its Model S, Model X and Cybertruck vehicles came in at 11,642 during the quarter. After its design debut, Tesla boasted about more than 1 million reservations flooding in for the Cybertruck. The angular, steel pickup has yet to be a best seller for the company. Musk's aerospace and defense company, SpaceX, reportedly purchased tens of millions of dollars worth of Cybertrucks in 2025.Tesla faces heightened competition in the electric vehicle market from China's BYD, South Korea's Kia and Hyundai, and Volkswagen in Europe, among others.BYD topped Tesla as the world's biggest seller of EVs in a calendar year, saying in a statement Thursday that sales grew 28% to 2.26 million units.Deliveries are the closest approximation of sales reported by Tesla, but are not precisely defined in the company's shareholder communications.In its energy business, Tesla said that it deployed 14.2 gigawatt hours of battery energy storage products in the fourth quarter, following a record in the prior period, when it deployed 12.5 GWh. Tesla's battery energy storage systems include backup batteries for homes and larger systems used alongside data centers and utilities. Tesla will report its fourth-quarter financial results on Jan. 28.Sales of Tesla's cars were impacted by President Donald Trump's decision to end a federal EV incentive by Sept. 30, earlier than previously planned. The expiration pulled some EV sales forward to the third quarter for Tesla and other automakers. Even before that, the start of 2025 was a struggle for Tesla.After spending heavily to propel Trump back to the White House, Musk spent the first quarter of the year leading the president's DOGE initiative to slash the federal workforce. Musk also endorsed Germany's extremist anti-immigrant party, AfD, and later supported British anti-Muslim and anti-immigration activist Tommy Robinson. In recent weeks, Musk has called to abolish the European Union.Partly in response to Musk's incendiary rhetoric, Tesla has faced an enduring consumer backlash in Europe and the U.S. The company hasn't fully recovered despite introducing a new, more affordable version of its Model Y SUV in October.However, Tesla shares still rallied in the second half of the year, jumping 40% in the third quarter, reaching a fresh record in mid-December. Musk bought $1 billion worth of shares in September.Shareholders approved a new $1 trillion pay plan for Musk in November that will give the CEO more shares and increased control over the company. The vote came after Musk threatened to potentially leave Tesla if the plan didn't pass. Critics voiced concerns that the plan doesn't require Musk to spend a minimum amount of time on his Tesla work and that there are no limits on his political activity.

Tesla's European registrations fell 39% in the first 11 months of 2025, while Chinese rival BYD saw registrations rise 240% in Europe. Overall, battery electric vehicles were more widely embraced in Europe in 2025, amounting to around 16% of all new vehicles sold there.Some analysts project that sales of Tesla's more affordable Model Y standard, which the company launched in October, will help the company regain ground in coming quarters.In a note last week, analysts at Cannacord Genuity wrote that EV adoption \"is rising quickly in emerging markets such as Thailand, Vietnam and Brazil, where robust consumer interest could create meaningful long-term upside for Tesla, even as it faces fierce rivalry from Chinese automakers.\" Besides BYD, Tesla now faces competition from other Chinese EV makers including Xiaomi and Geely.But Tesla is selling investors on Musk's vision of the future, or what he calls \"sustainable abundance,\" more than EV sales. That vision includes robotaxis, which Musk has promised for years, and humanoid robots, which he says will someday be able to serve as factory workers, babysitters, crime stoppers and surgeons.

Prior to the start of the press conference, the president apparently posted a video of the operation on Truth Social.  U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi said in a post on X that Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, have been indicted in the Southern District of New York.The Maduros have been charged with conspiracy to commit narco-terrorism, cocaine importation conspiracy, possession of weapons and destructive devices, and conspiracy to possess machineguns and destructive devices against the U.S., according to Bondi's post.\"They will soon face the full wrath of American justice on American soil in American courts,\" she wrote.CBS News reported that the U.S. Army's elite Delta Force unit was involved in the capture of Maduro.In an interview with \"Fox and Friends Weekend\" on Saturday, Trump said the U.S. suffered a few injuries but no deaths in the operation, and that U.S. forces waited four days to launch the attack due to weather conditions.Trump also said Maduro and his wife were flown to the USS Iwo Jima following their capture and will head to New York to face the narco-terrorism charges. Photo posted on President Donald Trump's Truth Social appears to show Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro on board the USS Iwo Jima.

The helicopter took them out,\" the president said.The Pentagon declined to answer CNBC's queries and referred questions to the White House. The White House, which reposted Trump's Truth Social statement on its X account, didn't immediately respond to a CNBC request for comment.Republican Senator Mike Lee of Utah, who had earlier questioned whether the U.S. attack was constitutional, said in a X post on Saturday that Secretary of State Marco Rubio told him the U.S. operation \"was deployed to protect and defend those executing the arrest warrant.\"\"This action likely falls within the president's inherent authority under Article II of the Constitution to protect U.S. personnel from an actual or imminent attack,\" Lee added.Rubio, meanwhile, responded to the operation on social media by reposting a statement he made in July 2025, stating: \"Maduro is NOT the President of Venezuela and his regime is NOT the legitimate government. Maduro is the head of the Cartel de Los Soles, a narco-terror organization which has taken possession of a country. And he is under indictment for pushing drugs into the United States.\"U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Christopher Landau said in a post on X that Maduro would \"finally face justice for his crimes.\"watch nowThere was no immediate confirmation from the Venezuelan government. Delcy Rodríguez, Venezuela's vice president, demanded that the U.S. provide proof that Maduro and his wife are alive, in an interview on state television station Venezolana de Televisión.Maduro's official Facebook page posted a video stating that attacks occurred in the states of Miranda, Aragua and La Guaira, according to a Google translation of the Spanish-language statement.The statement in the video added that the U.S. would fail in its goal of possessing Venezuela's oil and minerals, and that Maduro had declared a national emergency and mobilized defense forces.The official spokesperson for Nobel Peace Prize winner Maria Corina Machado, who leads the  Venezuelan opposition, said in a post on X that it had no comment on the operation.Trump told The New York Times that the operation was a result of \"a lot of good planning.\" \"It was a brilliant operation, actually,\" Trump told the Times.Explosions were reported in the Venezuelan capital, Caracas, at about 2 a.m. local time (0600 GMT), according to images circulating on social media that could not be independently verified.Venezuelan state-run energy company PDVSA's oil production and refining were normal, and its key facilities had suffered no damage, according to an initial assessment, two sources with knowledge of the company's operations told Reuters.The port of La Guaira near Caracas, one of the country's largest but is not used for oil operations, was reported to have suffered severe damage, Reuters reported.Smoke rises from Port of La Guaira after explosions and low-flying aircraft were heard on January 03, 2026 in Caracas, Venezuela. Jesus Vargas | Getty ImagesTrump has repeatedly threatened action against Maduro. On Dec. 23, 2025, he said it would be \"smart\" for Maduro to leave power.Trump last month announced a blockade of sanctioned oil tankers moving in and out of Venezuelan waters, saying the country was \"completely surrounded by the largest Armada ever assembled in the History of South America.\"The strategy to pressure Maduro comes as the U.S. and Venezuela's opposition say Maduro rigged an election last year to stay in power. Trump has also accused Maduro of running a \"narco-state.\"Colombian President Gustavo Petro said in a post on X that Caracas was under attack and urged an emergency meeting of the Organization of American States and the United Nations.Maduro, who succeeded Hugo Chavez in 2013, has said Washington is seeking control of its oil reserves, the largest in the world.— CNBC's Terri Cullen contributed to this report.This is breaking news.

    "body": "watch nowSAN FRANCISCO — Inside Anthropic headquarters, President and co-founder Daniela Amodei keeps coming back to a phrase that's become a sort of governing principle for the artificial intelligence startup's entire strategy: Do more with less.It's a direct challenge to the prevailing mood across Silicon Valley, where the biggest labs and their backers are treating scale as destiny. Firms are raising record sums, locking up chips years in advance, and pouring concrete across the American heartland for data centers in the belief that the company that builds the largest intelligence factory will win.OpenAI has become the clearest example of that approach. The company has made roughly $1.4 trillion in headline compute and infrastructure commitments as it works with partners to stand up massive data center campuses and secure next-generation chips at a pace the industry has never seen.Anthropic's pitch is that there's another way through the race, one where disciplined spending, algorithmic efficiency, and smarter deployment can keep you at the frontier without trying to outbuild everyone else.\"I think what we have always aimed to do at Anthropic is be as judicious with the resources that we have while still operating in this space where it's just a lot of compute,\" Amodei told CNBC. \"Anthropic has always had a fraction of what our competitors have had in terms of compute and capital, and yet, pretty consistently, we've had the most powerful, most performant models for the majority of the past several years.\"watch nowDaniela Amodei and her brother, Dario Amodei, who is Anthropic's CEO and a Baidu and Google alumni, helped build the very worldview they're now betting against.Dario Amodei was among the researchers who helped popularize the scaling paradigm that has guided the modern model race. It is the strategy that increasing compute, data, model size, and capabilities tends to improve the model in a predictable way.That pattern has effectively become the financial bedrock of the AI arms race. It underwrites hyperscaler capital spending, justifies towering chip valuations, and keeps private markets willing to assign enormous prices to companies that are still spending heavily to reach profitability.But even as Anthropic has benefited from that logic, the company is trying to prove that the next phase of competition won't be decided only by who can afford the largest pre-training runs. Its strategy leans into higher-quality training data, post-training techniques that improve reasoning, and product choices designed to make models cheaper to run and easier to adopt at scale — the part of the AI business where the compute bill never stops.To be clear, Anthropic isn't operating on a shoestring. The company has roughly $100 billion in compute commitments, and expects those requirements to keep rising if it wants to stay at the frontier. \"The compute requirements for the future are very large,\" Daniela Amodei said. \"So our expectation is, yes, we will need more compute to be able to just stay at the frontier as we get bigger.\"Still, the company argues that the headline numbers flying around the sector are often not directly comparable — and that the industry's collective certainty about the \"right\" amount to spend is less solid than it sounds.\"A lot of the numbers that are thrown around are sort of not exactly apples to apples, because of just how the structure of some of these deals are kind of set up,\" she said, describing an environment where players feel pressure to commit early to secure hardware years down the line. The bigger truth, she added, is that even insiders who helped shape the scaling thesis have been surprised by how consistently performance and business growth have compounded.watch now\"We have continued to be surprised, even as the people who pioneered this belief in scaling laws,\" Daniela Amodei said. \"Something that I hear from my colleagues a lot is, the exponential continues until it doesn't. And every year we've been like, 'Well, this can't possibly be the case that things will continue on the exponential' — and then every year it has.\"That line captures both the optimism and the anxiety of today's buildout. If the exponential keeps holding, then the companies that lock up power, chips and sites early may look prescient. If it breaks — or if adoption lags behind the pace of capability — then the players that overcommitted could be left carrying years of fixed costs and long-lead-time infrastructure built for demand that never arrives.Daniela Amodei drew a distinction between the technology curve and the economic curve, an important nuance that tends to get conflated in the public debate. From a technological perspective, she said Anthropic doesn't see progress slowing down, based on what the company has observed so far. The more complicated question is how quickly businesses and consumers can integrate those capabilities into real workflows where procurement, change management, and human friction can slow even the best tool.\"Regardless of how good the technology is, it takes time for that to be used in a business or sort of personal context,\" she said. \"The real question to me is: How quickly can businesses in particular, but also individuals, leverage the technology?\"That enterprise emphasis is central to why Anthropic has become such a closely watched bellwether for the broader generative AI trade. The company has positioned itself as an enterprise-first model provider, with much of its revenue tied to other companies paying to plug Claude into workflows, products, and internal systems — usage that can be stickier than a consumer app, where churn can rise once the novelty fades.watch nowAnthropic said revenue has grown tenfold year over year for three straight years. And it has built a distribution footprint that's unusual in a market defined by fierce rivalry. The Claude model is available across the major cloud platforms, including through partners that are also building and selling competing models.Daniela Amodei framed that presence less as détente and more as a reflection of customer pull, with large enterprises wanting optionality across clouds, and cloud providers wanting to offer what their biggest customers are asking to buy.In practice, that multicloud posture is also a way to compete without making a single infrastructure bet. If OpenAI is attempting to anchor a vast buildout around bespoke campuses and dedicated capacity, Anthropic is trying to remain flexible, shifting where it runs based on cost, availability, and customer demand, while focusing internal energy on improving model efficiency and performance per unit of compute.As 2026 begins, the divide matters for another reason: Both companies are being pushed toward the discipline of public-market readiness while still operating in a private-market world where compute needs are growing faster than certainty.Anthropic and OpenAI have not announced IPO timelines, but both are making moves that look like preparation, adding finance, governance, forecasting, and an operating cadence that can withstand public scrutiny. At the same time, both are still raising fresh capital and striking ever-larger compute arrangements to fund the next leg of model development.That sets up a real test of strategy rather than rhetoric. If the market keeps funding scale, OpenAI's approach may remain the industry standard. If investors start demanding greater efficiency, Anthropic's \"do more with less\" posture could put them at an advantage.In that sense, Anthropic's contrarian bet isn't that scaling doesn't work. It's that scaling isn't the only lever that matters, and that the winner of the next phase may be the lab that can keep improving while spending in a way the real economy can sustain.\"The exponential continues until it doesn't,\" Daniela Amodei said. The question for 2026 is what happens to the AI arms race — and to the companies building it — if the industry's favorite curve finally stops behaving.WATCH: Anthropic, OpenAI rivalry goes globalwatch now",

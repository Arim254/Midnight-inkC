    "body": "Larry SummersCameron Costa | CNBCFormer Treasury Secretary Larry Summers said Monday that he was stepping back from all public commitments amid fallout from the release of emails between him and the notorious sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.\"I am deeply ashamed of my actions and recognize the pain they have caused. I take full responsibility for my misguided decision to continue communicating with Mr. Epstein,\" Summers said in a statement obtained by CNBC.\"While continuing to fulfill my teaching obligations, I will be stepping back from public commitments as one part of my broader effort,\" said Summers, a former president of Harvard University who teaches at the school.Summers is a member of the board of OpenAI. He is also a columnist for Bloomberg News.CNBC has requested comment from OpenAI.Summer's statement came after Harvard's newspaper, the Crimson, published an article detailing his emails with Epstein, which came to light last week when the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee released more than 20,000 documents it obtained pursuant to a subpoena from Epstein's estate.U.S. financier Jeffrey Epstein appears in a photograph taken for the New York State Division of Criminal Justice Services' sex offender registry March 28, 2017 and obtained by Reuters July 10, 2019.New York State Division of Criminal Justice Services | Handout | ReutersThe Crimson noted that when Summers was \"pursuing a romantic relationship with a woman he described as a mentee, he sought guidance from a longtime associate: convicted sex offender Jeffrey E. Epstein.\"Emails and texts between the two men from November 2018 and July 2019, showed Summers, who was and is married, turning \"to Epstein for advice on his pursuit of the woman,\" the paper reported.That time frame was a decade after Epstein pleaded guilty in Florida state court to solicitation of prostitution from an underage girl.In the emails and texts, \"Epstein was quick to chime in with assurance and suggestions, describing himself in one November 2018 message as Summers' 'wing man.' \" the Crimson noted.\"Think for now I'm going nowhere with her except economics mentor,\" Summers wrote that same month. \"I think I'm right now in the seen very warmly in rear view mirror category.\"\"She must be very confused or maybe wants to cut me off but wants professional connection a lot and so holds to it.\"Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a Massachusetts Democrat and a former professor at Harvard Law, told CNN that Harvard should sever its ties to Summers. Summer is the director of the Mossavar-Rahmani Center for Business and Government at the Harvard Kennedy School, and this semester is teaching five courses at Harvard, the Crimson noted.Warren said Summers \"cannot be trusted\" with students, given his past relationship with Epstein.\"For decades, Larry Summers has demonstrated his attraction to serving the wealthy and well-connected, but his willingness to cozy up to a convicted sex offender demonstrates monumentally bad judgment,\" Warren told CNN. \"If he had so little ability to distance himself from Jeffrey Epstein even after all that was publicly known about Epstein's sex offenses involving underage girls, then Summers cannot be trusted to advise our nation's politicians, policymakers, and institutions — or teach a generation of students at Harvard or anywhere else.\"On Friday, Attorney General Pam Bondi, acting on a request from President Donald Trump, said she had asked Manhattan U.S. Attorney Jay Clayton to investigate Epstein's relationships with Summers, former President Bill Clinton, billionaire tech investor Reid Hoffman, and the bank JPMorgan Chase.Trump himself is a former friend of Epstein. The president has been criticized for months for the Department of Justice's refusal to release investigative files related to Epstein, who killed himself in August 2019, weeks after his arrest on federal child sex trafficking charges.The House of Representatives on Tuesday is set to vote on a measure that would force the DOJ to release the Epstein files.",

    "body": "Warren Buffett ahead of the Berkshire Hathaway Annual Shareholder Meeting in Omaha, Nebraska, in 2023.David A. Grogan | CNBCAlphabet shares jumped Monday after Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway revealed a new stake in the Google parent, marking one of the conglomerate's most significant technology bets in years.Alphabet shares gained 3.1%, bucking the weakness in most technology shares to start the week.A quarterly 13F filing showed Berkshire owned roughly $4.3 billion worth of Alphabet as of Sept. 30, making it the firm's 10th largest equity holding. The move surprised many Buffett watchers given the billionaire's decades-long hesitation toward high-growth tech companies. Buffett has always seen Apple, Berkshire's largest holding, as a consumer products company.The Alphabet investment likely came from one of his two lieutenants, Todd Combs or Ted Weschler, who increasingly influence Berkshire's $300 billion stock portfolio. Though its size suggests it likely had the blessing of Buffett, who is stepping down as CEO at the end of this year. The pair have been responsible for many of Berkshire's tech-leaning investments, including a stake in Amazon initiated in 2019. Berkshire still owns $2.2 billion worth of Amazon today.Alphabet has been one of the stock market's biggest winners this year, rising 46% as investors reward its accelerating artificial intelligence push and rapidly improving cloud profitability. Revenue growth from Google Cloud, once a margin drag, has turned into a key earnings driver.Changing of the guard?Bill Stone, Glenview Trust Company's chief investment officer, said the Alphabet purchase could reflect a broader approach to technology investments as leadership transitions to the next generation.\"Perhaps the purchase of Alphabet signals a widening of the circle of competence into technology,\" Stone said.Longtime lieutenant Greg Abel is set to take the reins for 95-year-old Buffett in January. The Oracle of Omaha will remain chairman of the board.Despite the stellar rally in 2025, Alphabet's valuation remains lower than many of its AI-driven megacap peers. The stock trades at 26.9 times next year's earnings, compared with Microsoft at 31.8, Broadcom at 40.7 and Nvidia at 31.8, according to FactSet.That relative discount, combined with Alphabet's massive cash flow and dominant market position, may have made the shares particularly attractive to Buffett's team.\"We think Berkshire likely finds more comfort investing in GOOG over other tech plays given the high free cash flow potential of its core business coupled with an attractive valuation at about 22x 2027 EPS amid a healthy top-line growth trajectory,\" Angelo Zino, Alphabet analyst at CFRA, said in a note to clients.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconAlphabet year to dateBuffett has admitted missing Google was one of his biggest investing mistakes. He had a front-row seat: Geico, Berkshire's auto insurance unit, was one of Google's earliest major advertisers. The company paid about $10 every time a user clicked one of its search ads in the early days of online marketing.\"I had seen the product work, and I knew the kind of margins [they had],\" Buffett said in 2018. \"I didn't know enough about technology to know whether this really was the one that would stop the competitive race.\"",

Nurphoto | Nurphoto | Getty ImagesIndia's goods trade deficit hit an all-time high of $41.7 billion in October as gold imports surged on festive season demand, while exports to U.S. bore the brunt of steep tariffs.The deficit, which was sharply wider than Reuters poll estimates of $28.8 billion, topped the previous all-time high of $37.8 billion in November 2024, according to LSEG data.During October, India imported gold worth of $14.7 billion, up nearly 200% from a year earlier, data from the country's commerce ministry released Monday showed. Indian consumers are estimated to have bought gold worth $11 billion during the 5-day festival period in October.The impact of tariffs was also visible in trade data as India's exports to the U.S. fell for a second consecutive month since the 50% tariffs came into effect in August end. Shipments to U.S. fell 8.5% year on year in October to $6.3 billion.Despite the decline, the U.S remained India's largest exports destination during the first 7 months of this fiscal year, accounting for shipments worth $52 billion.India exported gems and jewelry worth $2.3 billion in October down 29.5%, engineering goods worth $9.4 billion, down 16.7%. Exports of cotton and man-made yarn and ready-made garments fell 12%-13%. The U.S. is the top export destination for all these commodities.Meanwhile, India's exports to China rose 42% to $1.6 billion.The country's merchandise imports are \"expected to cool somewhat in November-December 2025 from the October levels\" due to a sequential dip in gold imports as the festive season ends and some pickup in exports, Moody's-owned Indian credit rating firm ICRA Research said in a note on Monday.But it cautioned that India's current account deficit is set to \"widen materially to 2.4-2.5% of GDP\" in the third quarter of fiscal year ending March 2026. It expects the ratio of CAD to gross domestic product to be around 1.2% in fiscal year 2026, if the 50% U.S. tariffs continue until end-March 2026.Trade negotiations between U.S and India have been underway for months, but a deal has been elusive so far. Both sides have begun to soften their stance, with U.S. President Donald Trump hinting at reducing tariffs on India.Reaching out to Washington, New Delhi has increased oil and gas purchases from the U.S. to reduce the trade surplus it enjoys with Washington. The country is also expected to purchase farm products from the U.S.",

However, it may be that U.S. investments into Saudi Arabia see the strongest growth in the coming years given the improved investment climate in the kingdom,\" Callen said, with \"opportunities provided by Vision 2030, and availability of reliable low-cost energy and abundant land to support the expansion of AI and related activities of U.S. tech companies.\"Image rehabilitiationThe visit to the U.S. will be the first undertaken by Saudi Arabia's defacto ruler since 2018, when Saudi agents killed a journalist and high-profile critic of the Saudi regime, Jamal Khashoggi, in a Saudi consulate in Istanbul.Mohammed bin Salman, or MBS as he's widely known, denied ordering the killing but a U.S. intelligence report concluded the crown prince had approved the operation.Protests in Washington over the disappearance of prominent Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi on Oct. 10, 2018.Umar Farooq | Anadolu Agency | Getty ImagesSince the widespread scandal around the killing, and criticism of Saudi's record when it comes to gender equality and human rights generally, the kingdom has looked to rehabilitate its global image. It has done this predominantly through looking to broker peace agreements in the Middle East, and a push to host blockbuster sports events, such as the 2034 World Cup in men's soccer.Having seen its regional nemesis Iran largely weakened as a result of U.S. and Israeli joint strikes on the republic, Saudi Arabia has seen its own dominance grow and has positioned itself as a key strategic ally to the U.S. in the region.",

    "body": "Take-Two Interactive CEO Strauss Zelnick said on Monday that although gaming consoles are not going away, the industry is moving toward PCs in the next decade.\"I think it's moving towards PC and business is moving towards open rather than closed,\" Zelnick told CNBC's \"Squawk Box.\" \"But if you define console as the property, not the system, then the notion of a very rich game that you engage in for many hours that you play on a big screen — that's never going away.\"Zelnick said the current split between console and mobile is about even in the market, but mobile is growing more rapidly than consoles.Although gaming giants like Sony's PlayStation and Nintendo have remained focused on traditional consoles to major success, rivals like Microsoft's Xbox have hinted at more PC-based gaming for the next generation of hardware.\"It's kind of funny that people think about the console and PC as two different things,\" Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella recently said in an interview with TBPN. \"We built the console because we wanted to build a better PC, which could then perform for gaming. I kind of want to revisit some of that conventional wisdom.\"Gaming company Valve garnered significant buzz last week after announcing its new Steam Machine, a console-PC hybrid that can run PC games on a television or as a normal gaming computer.\"Expanding access across PC, console, and handheld devices reflects a future built on choice, core values that have guided Xbox's vision from the start,\" Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer wrote in an X post congratulating Valve.Read more CNBC tech newsDespite Coinbase departure, only 28 companies have left Delaware this yearThe question everyone in AI is asking: How long before a GPU depreciates?'Vibe revenue': AI companies admit they're worried about a bubbleWall Street cools on Oracle's buildout plans as debt concerns mount: 'AI sentiment is waning'Although Take-Two's most high-profile titles, such as its \"Grand Auto Theft\" and \"Borderlands\" series, are largely played through console and PC, the company has invested heavily in its mobile segment after the mobile gaming industry rocketed during the pandemic.In 2022, the company bought mobile developer Zynga for $12.7 billion, the largest gaming acquisition at the time.The lofty purchase has since paid off, with Take-Two's mobile division leading the company's revenue during the second quarter despite the release of notable titles including \"Borderlands 4,\" \"NBA 2K26\" and \"Mafia: The Old Country.\"Mobile games from developers like Zynga, Rollic and Nordeus accounted for 46% of Take-Two's net revenue during the quarter, while console sold slightly less at 41% and PC and other platforms contributed 13%.\"Mobile, of course, is taken with you, it's repeatable, and it's enjoyable,\" Zelnick said Monday. \"And I do think because it appeals to the broadest possible audience, it will probably continue to grow more rapidly.\"The CEO said during the earnings call that the company expected the mobile unit to increase by around 10% in the next quarter.Although mobile gaming slowed down after seeing unprecedented highs during Covid, the market is seeing some reacceleration this year.Global mobile game revenue is expected to generate $188.8 billion this year, increasing 3.4% from last year, according to research from Newzoo. Console and PC are projected to earn a combined $45.9 billion, or 45% of the total gaming market.",

    "body": "The exterior of the main entrance of Ford Motor's new world headquarters in Dearborn, Michigan.FordDEARBORN, Mich. — Ford Motor is swapping its 1950s \"Glass House\" headquarters for a new, modern industrial facility to promote collaboration and better appease thousands of employees who have returned to offices in recent years after remote working.The new 2.1-million-square-foot facility in Dearborn, Michigan, is ceremoniously opening Sunday, although construction is expected to continue into 2027.It replaces a 12-story, rectangular-shaped headquarters roughly three miles away in the city that is expected to be demolished. The new building marks Ford's sixth headquarters since its founding in 1903.Currently nicknamed \"The Hub,\" the new headquarters will consolidate thousands of employees and several prior locations under one — albeit very large — roof. It is eventually expected to be home to up to 4,000 executives and employees involved with daily business operations, design and product development.Ford Motor's new world headquarters in Dearborn, Michigan, will function as corporate offices as well as a design and product development center.FordFrom an operational basis, the new headquarters is roughly split evenly between office functions and design and industrial operations. Design includes massive studios with hidden courtyards and a large showroom. The other half is set to be used for general business operations such as executive offices and common work and meeting areas.There are very few actual offices outside of those for top executives, according to the company. The idea is for employees to be able to work as they choose in different areas, or \"neighborhoods,\" depending on what they're working on that day, officials said. Domain staking, where employees attempt to make a space their permanent workplace, will be discouraged, said Jennifer Kolstad, global design and brand director for Ford Land, the automaker's property management group.\"It's not just a building. This is a space that is a tool for our employees to be more productive, to be more collaborative, and really help deliver the Ford+ plan,\" said Jim Dobleske, Ford Land chair and CEO, during a tour of the building.The Ford+ plan was introduced by CEO Jim Farley as a turnaround and efficiency plan for the automaker in 2021.A coffee bar in Ford Motor's new world headquarters in Dearborn, Michigan.FordAs of the end of last year, Ford employed roughly 30,500 white-collar salaried workers in the U.S. The company continues to own or utilize other properties throughout the U.S., including large bases in Dearborn and surrounding areas.Many salaried employees are expected in offices at least four days a week, as of earlier this year, after many of them had a more loose hybrid office-home schedule following the end of the pandemic.\"We're inviting them back into a space that is a tool to help them do their best work. And that best work tends to come with collaboration with other teams,\" Dobleske said.Read more CNBC auto newsInside Ford’s new HQ: Rotisserie chickens and design secretsFord partners with Amazon for dealers to sell used vehicles onlineJeep eyes U.S. comeback following yearslong sales troublesTesla recalls 10,500 Powerwall 2 battery systems due to overheating, fire riskScratch kitchensSome of that collaboration is expected to occur over food.The new headquarters includes a 160,000-square-foot dining area with eight \"kitchen concepts\" that will feature rotating menus as well as take-home options such as pizza and $6 whole rotisserie chickens, decadent desserts and a juice bar complete with a herb garden.A worker takes out a batch of rotisserie chickens inside Ford Motor's new world headquarters on Nov. 10, 2025, in Dearborn, Michigan.Michael Wayland / CNBC\"We have guests coming in from all over the world, so we wanted to make sure we have designed our menus to kind of play homage to that diversity,\" said Grant Vella, executive chef for the new ]headquarters. \"We wanted to do something different, push the boundary of business dining.\"Outside of the kitchens and dining areas, vegetation and outdoor spaces are meant to make for a more walkable-friendly campus compared with the automaker's prior, largely street- and parking lot-locked facility.\"This headquarters is the cornerstone of our campus redevelopment, but there's been a tremendous amount of work that we have done throughout the campus to really connect it and make it much more walkable for our employees,\" Dobleske said, pointing to several facilities and areas, including a test track and 18-acre \"Horsepower Park,\" surrounding the building.An herb garden inside the dining and kitchen area of Ford Motor's new world headquarters on Nov. 10, 2025 in Dearborn, Michigan.Michael Wayland / CNBCInside the building are six courtyards, including a dual-level one at the center of the company's new design studios to allow designers to take products outside to view them outdoors in natural light.

There's also a coffee bar on a large landing above the main lobby.Ford Bronco parts painted white in the American Road Lobby of the automaker's new world headquarters in Dearborn, Michigan.FordThe coffee bar overlooks a white artwork that features vehicle parts — one of many prominent pieces of art Ford purchased or has curated for the new facility.

    "body": "Epstein Survivors Launch National PSA Calling for Release of Remaining FilesSource: WorldWithoutExploitation.orgA group of victims of Jeffrey Epstein in a new ad calls for Congress to pass a measure to force the Department of Justice to release investigative files about the notorious sex offender, following months of resistance to that by the Trump administration.\"Five administrations and we're still in the dark,\" the public service announcement says at the end, after the victims hold up photos showing themselves as girls and young women, when Epstein began abusing them.\"Call your Congress member and demand they release all the Epstein files,\" the PSA produced by the group World Without Exploitation says.The ad comes in advance of a House of Representatives vote on the measure. NBC News reported Monday that House GOP leaders intend to put the Epstein resolution on the floor for a vote on Tuesday.On Sunday night, in a major reversal, President Donald Trump urged House Republicans to vote in favor of the measure. Trump last week pressured congressional Republicans not to support a petition that forced the vote.But he now seems to acknowledge the likelihood of the Republican-controlled House, and potentially the Senate, voting in favor of the measure.Trump and the DOJ for months have resisted demands that they release the Epstein files after Attorney General Pam Bondi reneged on promises to make those documents public.\"I was 17 when I met Jeffrey Epstein,\" said Danielle Bensky, one of the women in the ad, said in a statement.\"I was an aspiring ballerina working odd jobs to support my mother, who was battling a brain tumor, and to keep up with my training,\" Bensky said.\"A woman told me about a wealthy philanthropist who might help. What began as a chance to pay for dance lessons turned into months of abuse,\" she said. \"Epstein used my mother's illness to control me. He promised help and threatened to take it away if I spoke. It took me years to tell the truth, and I tell it now because too many people still believe this story should stay hidden.\"A billboard in Times Square, paid for by the group Home of the Brave, highlights Jeffrey Epstein's comment that Donald Trump \"of course he knew about the girls.\", on November 17, 2025 in New York City. Adam Gray | Getty ImagesAnother victim, Annie Farmer, in a statement said, \"When I was 16, I trusted adults who told me they wanted to help me succeed. That trust was taken advantage of in a way that shaped the rest of my life.\"Farmer also said, \"The people who shielded Epstein have had decades of protection. Survivors have had decades of unanswered questions. Sharing the remaining documents helps correct that imbalance.\"Trump, in a Truth Social post on Sunday, said, \"House Republicans should vote to release the Epstein files.\"\"Because we have nothing to hide, and it's time to move on from this Democrat Hoax perpetrated by Radical Left Lunatics in order to deflect from the Great Success of the Republican Party, including our recent Victory on the Democrat 'Shutdown,'\" Trump wrote.Despite Trump's comment about Democrats, the measure has been pushed by Rep. Thomas Massie, a Kentucky Republican. Massie has said that 100 or more Republicans in the House might end up voting for it.Read more CNBC politics coverageAI could be causing ‘quiet time’ in labor market, top Trump economic aide Hassett saysTrump reverses stance on Epstein records, presses Republicans to support releaseFormer Fed Gov.

The email did not say what Epstein meant by that.

The president has never been charged in connection with any of Epstein's conduct.",

    "body": "A Swiss national flag on a ferry on Lake Geneva in Geneva, Switzerland, on Tuesday, Aug. 5, 2025. The Swiss president dashed to the US capital Tuesday in a last-minute attempt to prevent her American counterpart from imposing the highest tariff of any developed nation on Switzerland.  Photographer: Andrew Kravchenko/Bloomberg via Getty ImagesBloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesSwitzerland's fledgling trade deal with the U.S. is dividing opinion as government and business leaders welcome a \"restart\" for the country, while critics caution it amounts to a sellout to the White House.The trade deal, announced on Friday, saw duties on Swiss exports to the States slashed from 39% to 15% and Swiss companies pledge to make $200 billion in investments in the U.S., including promises to increase manufacturing Stateside.Switzerland had launched a charm offensive ahead of the deal, sending a group of top Swiss CEOs — including the heads of luxury goods giants Rolex and Richemont — to the States in early November, bearing gifts for U.S. President Donald Trump, including a gold Rolex watch and specially-engraved gold bar.While Switzerland's lobbying helped it secure its new framework trade agreement with the U.S., the deal drew criticism over the weekend.The Greens, for example, called the deal a \"surrender agreement\" with party leader Lisa Mazzone reportedly saying the \"the Swiss economic elite and the Federal Council are bowing down to Donald Trump\" with Swiss consumers and farmers likely to pay the price.The party also questioned the involvement of business execs, saying the government had bought the deal with \"questionable methods and gifts of gold.\"Swiss Economy Minister Guy Parmelin rejected criticism that the deal amounted to a capitulation to Trump, and also defended the use of business leaders to woo the White House.\"We haven't sold our soul to the devil,\" Parmelin said in an interview with the Tagesanzeiger newspaper this weekend, adding that he was \"satisfied\" with the agreement and suggested it could still be tweaked and improved.\"I would be proud if we were back to zero percent tariffs. It's been a long road, and the result is the best we could achieve. Above all, it gives us a starting point for the next negotiations,\" he told the paper in comments translated by Google.Parmelin said business execs who had travelled to Washington were only there to \"explain their position\" and how tariffs were affecting trade. He conceded, however, that the trip had had a positive impact on talks.\"But it's true: they have influence because they have many good contacts in the U.S. — and not just with the Trump family. Some are friends with him because they play golf with him. I don't play golf, that's perhaps my handicap — but that's life,\" Parmelin said.'Restart,' but a hit anyway?Swiss industry leaders are certainly relieved that a framework agreement has been reached but it will take time to implement. Question marks remain over some of the details, such as whether Switzerland will have to accept U.S. meat imports like chlorinated chicken or hormone-treated beef, which are controversial in Europe, as part of the duty-free bilateral tariff quotas that have been agreed in principle.The framework agreement is non-binding too, with more talks set to take place to finalize details within the deal which will ultimately need the Swiss parliament, and potentially a public vote, to approve it.The U.S. was upbeat about the deal on Friday, with U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer telling CNBC that the Swiss' $200 billion investment in the States would boost the domestic economy.watch now\"They're going to send a lot of manufacturing here to the United States — pharmaceuticals, gold smelting, railway equipment — so we're really excited about that deal and what it means for American manufacturing.\"Swiss manufacturers are also relieved about the deal, according to Stefan Brupbacher, chief executive of Swissmem, an association which represents mechanical and electrical engineering industries who, he said, had seen a 15% drop in exports to the U.S. since August, with machine exporters hit even harder.\"For our members, there is great relief, because first of all, coming down from 39 to 15% puts us at par with our main competitors from Europe and Japan, and hence why we suffered enormously over the past three months with a slump of exports to the U.S. between 15% and 40%,\" he told CNBC's \"Europe Early Edition.\"watch now\"This 15% tariff rate puts us at par with our main competitors, and that is a basis on which we can restart,\" he said.Flash data released by the Swiss economy ministry on Monday showed the economy shrank by 0.5% in the third quarter of 2025. The contraction, the ministry said, was \"driven by a sharp decline in value added in the chemical and pharmaceutical sector, industry as a whole recorded negative growth.\"Alessandro Bee, economist at UBS, said in analysis Monday that despite the framework deal between the U.S. and Switzerland, UBS' base case scenario was that the Swiss economy would see GDP growth of around 1% in 2026, which, it noted, \"is noticeably below the average growth of 1.9% over the past 15 years.\"\"Growth should be supported by the domestic economy, while we do not expect any significant impetus from foreign trade,\" Bee said, cautioning that despite the reduction in trade duties, \"tariffs on exports to the U.S. remain substantial and are likely to markedly slow export growth to the U.S. compared to the previous year.\"Noting that around half of Swiss exports to the U.S. are made up by the pharmaceutical industry, which was never affected by the 39% tariff, Bee said that any relocation of some pharma manufacturing to the States — which some Swiss pharma companies have flagged — could dent the economy further.\"Nonetheless, Swiss pharmaceutical companies have indicated they are prepared to relocate production for the American market to the U.S., and this newly reached deal is unlikely to change these plans. We expect relocation of pharmaceutical production will weigh on Swiss growth in the medium term.\"",

    "body": "watch nowActor-entrepreneur Mark Wahlberg paid $37 million for a fully furnished mansion in Delray Beach, Florida, last month. The deal piqued interest and prompted coverage from TMZ to Architectural Digest, with most of the focus on the celebrity buyer.But aside from the name recognition, the home's skyrocketing price over the past five years also makes it stand out.The actor's transaction in October marks the home's fourth sale in that same time period, and a dramatic 118% price increase from its sale in January 2020 when the fully furnished mansion traded for $17 million.The grand entrance to the almost 17,800 sq ft estate known as Palazzo di Lago.Daniel PetroniThe estate, located at 9200 Rockybrook Way, saw a rise in value that outpaced not just the local market, but also many of the top luxury markets in America.In Delray Beach, the average sale price for a single-family luxury home, represented by the top 10% of closed sales, rose by just over 78%; Los Angeles was up 30%; the Hamptons rose 44%; and Manhattan increased just 4.5% according to Elliman Report data from the first quarter of 2020 to the third quarter of 2025.The home's steep rise in value even outperformed the S&P 500, which was up about 100% over the same time period.One mansion, four salesThe massive resort-style pool in the backyard is flanked by adult palms, a jumbo chess set, fire features, and a waterfall with a grotto below and a hot tub on top.Daniel PetroniRemarkably, the residence has traded hands four times since 2020. Just one real estate broker represented the listing in all four transactions, making the soaring value of the seven-bedroom, 10-bath mansion even more unique.Back in 2020, Douglas Elliman real estate broker Senada Adzem represented the original owners of 9200 Rockybrook, when the house was known as the Sundara estate. Three years later, Adzem represented the mansion's second owners who listed the home again, when it sold for $26 million, up 53% in just three years.A little over a year after buying the place, public records show a trust connected to William Cafaro, the co-president of a retail property development company in Niles, Ohio, and the home's third resident decided to sell. Adzem was once again the listing agent.This transaction was more unusual. Cafaro sold the home as part of a larger $50.5 million deal to purchase a Ferrari-inspired mansion less than half mile up the road in Stone Creek Ranch. Casa Maranello, as it's known, was being sold by local developer Aldo Stark, of Prestige Design Homes, with Adzem as the listing agent.Cafaro paid for the new home with $24.5 million in cash, plus the deed to 9200 Rockybrook Way, which was valued in the deal at the same price he'd paid for it: $26 million. When that sale closed in January 2025, Stark became the fourth owner of the mansion and he immediately started a dramatic multimillion-dollar renovation of the almost 17,800-square-foot megahome. He scrapped the old Sundara name and clad the home's old sheet-rocked walls in polished rare stones and bold high-gloss Guyana wood from Brazil.A side-by-side before and after of the foyer's grand staircase. Stark added a 30-ft tall vegetation wall and finished the adjacent walls in high-gloss Brazilian wood.He installed vibrant green vegetation above a grand stairway and into the ceilings.Stark completely reimagined everything from the kitchen to the clubroom and filled the residence with bespoke furniture.The kitchen before.Daniel PetroniThe kitchen after. The new-look includes counters clad in Orobico Grigio marble, floor-to-ceiling walnut cabinetry, vegetation accents in the ceiling and 30 tear-drop shaped light fixtures.And about two moths after closing, the megahome was listed for sale for a fourth time.  Reemerging with a new look, new name and a new price tag, one of the few things to remain the same was that Adzem was once again the listing agent.  The lounge bar before.Daniel PetroniThe lounge bar after.Daniel PetroniThe home, now called Palazzo di Lago, debuted with an ambitious $45 million asking price, $19 million more than what Stark paid for it two months earlier and 165% more than what it sold for in 2020.By October Adzem closed the fourth deal and delivered Palazzo di Lago to its fifth owner, who the buyer's broker, Michael Costello of Compass, confirmed to CNBC was Mark Wahlberg.One of the mansion's two home offices clad in great wave marble.Daniel PetroniAccording to Florida's Multiple Listing Service, the fully furnished mansion closed at $37 million, $11 million more than what Stark bought it for seven months earlier, and up 118% from its 2020 sale. And Adzem pulled off an uncommon feat in real estate, selling the same house four times in five years in transactions totaling $106 million.Primary bedroomDaniel PetroniFive owners across five years seems like an unusually high turnover rate, but Adzem has a simple explanation.\"People's circumstances change and they have different chapters in their life. So we were privileged to be able to guide this home through different evolutions and different owners and be able to add value to it,\" Adzem said.According to Adzem, the mansion's remarkable appreciation was fueled by a multitude of factors. Here are the top five:1. The pandemicAdzem attributed a large part of the 53% rise in price from 2020 to 2023 to the pandemic, which made demand and prices for homes in South Florida surge.\"After Covid, our market definitely accelerated,\" she told CNBC.Her walk-in closet is Chanel-boutique inspiredDaniel Petroni2. The 'micro-market'Some of the other market dynamics driving the price of Palazzo di Lago are unique to Stone Creek Ranch, which Adzem described as a luxury \"micro-market.\"The exclusive gated community spans about 187 acres with 37 luxury homes each on about 2.5 acre lots. It's a tight supply that's seen pricing dramatically impacted by a wave of new construction homes that have traded at record-breaking prices. Those recent comps helped push the price of Palazzo di Lago higher.Even the price of dirt in Stone Creek Ranch is on a steep rise. Back in 2013, the empty lot at 9200 Rockybrook Way traded for $800,000. In 2021, Adzem sold a comparable 2.5-acre lot for $1.7 million.\"The last one they traded was $6 million,\" Adzem told CNBC. \"However ... there are no vacant lots left in this community.\"And Adzem believes a more than threefold rise in the price of dirt here is just the beginning. She points to the fact that 2.5-acre lots worthy of a megahome are hard to come by in Palm Beach County, and the dwindling supply in this neighborhood in particular will push lot prices even higher. \"I feel like the dirt is going to double because the only upcoming potential sales would be teardowns.\"His closet takes inspiration from Tom Ford.Daniel Petroni3. The power of VIP neighborsAnother market driver: the tiny community's growing list of VIP owners.In 2021, billionaire hedge fund manager and owner of the New York Mets, Steve Cohen purchased the home next door to 9200 Rockybrook Way for about $22 million, according to MLS.\"[Potential buyers] typically do look to know who else owns in the community. That's important to them,\" Adzem said. Rich and famous residents can create a halo effect and make nearby real estate more desirable to potential buyers. And there's no shortage of ultra-high-net-worth neighbors living nearby, including several present and former CEOs of Fortune 500 companies, a former NFL player, and a pop star, according to Adzem and public records.And now some might even see Walhberg's new ownership as adding to the community's allure. Meanwhile, developer Stark just finished construction and recently moved into his own 32,000-square-foot mansion.Daniel Petroni4. Wealth migrationWealthy buyers looking to escape the tax burdens of their home states continue to see the tax advantages offered in Florida as a big draw and that helps drive and sustain demand.\"We saw a big influx and continued influx of buyers from California, from New York, from Connecticut, and they want what you see here,\" Adzem told CNBC.  The open-concept kitchen flows into a family room with faux vegetation that accents the ceiling.Daniel Petroni5. The multimillion-dollar renovationAdzem also credited Stark's renovation with adding to the estate's value.\"He didn't go neutral and he didn't go very light with color scheme. He really wanted to make an impact and put his own taste here,\" Adzem said.Adzem and Stark would only characterize the expense as \"a multimillion-dollar renovation,\" so it's unclear exactly how much it took to turn a home built in 2017 into the new Palazzo di Lago.But Adzem told CNBC the dramatic renovation and the new \"James-Bond-inspired vibe\" were the final catalysts that delivered a buyer willing to pay a premium.Correction: William Cafaro paid for the new home with $24.5 million in cash. A previous version of this story omitted the million. The price of the home rose 53% from 2020 to 2023. An earlier version misstated the percentage.",

    "body": "Boxes of Ozempic and Wegovy made by Novo Nordisk at a pharmacy in London on March 8, 2024.Hollie Adams | ReutersNovo Nordisk on Monday said it has cut the direct-to-consumer prices of its blockbuster weight loss drug Wegovy and diabetes counterpart Ozempic, adding to efforts by the company and the Trump administration to make the treatments more accessible. The Danish drugmaker is lowering the price of the drugs for existing cash-paying patients to $349 per month from $499 per month. But Novo Nordisk said the cash-pay cost of the highest dose of Ozempic will remain $499 per month. Also on Monday, Novo Nordisk launched a temporary introductory offer, which will allow new cash-paying patients to access the two lowest doses of Wegovy and Ozempic for $199 per month for the first two months of treatment. After that period, people move to the new standard monthly direct-to-consumer price. The company's introductory offer ends on March 31. The announcements come days after President Donald Trump struck deals with Novo Nordisk and chief rival Eli Lilly to make their popular GLP-1 drugs easier for Americans to access and afford. Those agreements will involve cutting the prices the government pays for the drugs, introducing Medicare coverage of obesity drugs for the first time for certain patients and offering discounted medicines on the government's new direct-to-consumer website launching in January called TrumpRx. More CNBC health coverageThe Trump administration is changing Covid, childhood vaccine recommendations – here's what it means for youU.S. to impose 100% tariff on branded, patented drugs unless firms build plants locally, Trump saysEli Lilly to build $6.5 billion Texas manufacturing facility for obesity pill, other drugs\"Our new savings offers provide immediate impact, bringing forward greater cost savings for those who are currently without coverage or choose to self-pay,\" said Dave Moore, Novo Nordisk's head of U.S. operations, said in a release. \"It is part of a larger strategy to expand access that includes building relationships with telehealth providers and major retailers, expanding coverage, and working with the Administration to lower costs for people living with chronic diseases like obesity.\"The Trump administration said starting doses of existing injections like Wegovy and Eli Lilly's weight loss drug Zepbound will be $350 per month on TrumpRx, but will \"trend down\" to $245 per month over a two-year period. On the day the deals were announced, Eli Lilly said it would lower prices by $50 on its own direct-to-consumer platform, LillyDirect, which already offers Zepbound at a discount to cash-paying patients. The multidose pen of Zepbound will be available at $299 per month at the lowest dose, with additional doses being priced up to $449 per month.Novo Nordisk's new cash-pay offers are available through Wegovy.com or Ozempic.com, the company's direct-to-consumer pharmacy, NovoCare, and other participating organizations and telehealth providers that work directly with the drugmaker, including Costco, GoodRx, WeightWatchers, Ro, LifeMD and eMed. ",

The announcement signals that Nvidia is opening up its NVLink platform to integrate with a wide variety of custom chips, instead of forcing customers to use its CPUs.Nvidia currently sells an AI product called Grace Blackwell that pairs multiple GPUs with an Nvidia-branded Arm-based CPU. Other configurations include servers that use CPus from Intel or Advanced Micro Devices.But Microsoft, Amazon and Google are all developing or deploying Arm-based CPUs in their clouds to give them more control over the set ups and reduce their costs.Arm doesn't make CPUs but it licenses its instruction set technology that those chips need. The company also sells designs that allow partners to more quickly build Arm-based chips.As part of Monday's announcement, Arm said that custom Neoverse chips will include a new protocol that'll allow them to move data seamlessly with GPUs.The CPU has historically been the most important part in a server. But generative AI infrastructure is based around the AI accelerator chip, which in most cases is an Nvidia GPU. As many as eight GPUs can be paird with a CPU in an AI server.In September, Nvidia said it would invest $5 billion into Intel, the leading CPU maker. A key part of the deal was to enable Intel CPUs to integrate into AI servers using Nvidia's NVLink technology.Nvidia reached an agreement to buy Arm for $40 billion in 2020, but the deal failed in 2022 because of regulatory issues in the U.S. and U.K. Nvidia had a small stake in Arm, which is majority-owned by Softbank, as of February.Meanwhile, Softbank liquidated its entire stake in Nvidia earlier this month and Softbank is backing the OpenAI Stargate project, which plans to use Arm technology in addition to chips from Nvidia and AMD.WATCH: Nvidia's options pricing can swing 6-7% in either direction, says Susquehanna's Murphywatch now",

    "body": "watch nowA bipartisan super PAC launched by a slew of artificial intelligence leaders has picked its first target: a Democratic congressional candidate who helped lead an effort to put safety measures on the AI industry.Alex Bores, a New York State Assembly member, has pushed \"ideological and politically motivated legislation\" that would \"handcuff\" the nation's edge on AI, the heads of the \"Leading the Future\" PAC said in a statement Monday morning.Bores, who is running to represent New York's 12th Congressional District, co-sponsored the RAISE Act, a New York state-level bill that requires the largest AI companies to publish safety protocols for serious misuse use of their tech, such as creating biological weapons or carrying out other criminal activity.The legislation, short for \"Responsible AI Safety and Education,\" also forces companies to disclose serious incidents, or else face civil penalties from the state attorney general.The bill passed in the state assembly and senate months ago, but New York Gov. Kathy Hochul, a Democrat who has touted AI investments in the Empire State, has yet to sign it into law.Assemblymember Alex Bores from Assembly District 73 speaks on the State Capitol Wednesday, May 29, 2025, in Albany New York.Kena Betancur | APBores and the bill's other co-sponsor in the assembly, Andrew Gounardes, maintain that the RAISE Act has been crafted not to stifle innovation in the fast-moving AI sector. A controversial bill in California to erect safety guardrails on AI was vetoed by Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom in September amid concerns that it would create a chilling effect on the industry.Leading the Future, which launched over the summer with more than $100 million in backing, insists that the RAISE Act poses the same threat.\"The RAISE Act is a clear example of the patchwork, uninformed, and bureaucratic state laws that would slow American progress and open the door for China to win the global race for AI leadership,\" the PAC's leaders, political strategists Zac Moffatt and Josh Vlasto, said in their statement.\"America needs one clear and consistent national regulatory framework for AI that strengthens our economy, creates jobs for American workers, supports vibrant communities, and protects users,\" they said.\"Bills like the RAISE Act threaten American competitiveness, limit economic growth, leave users exposed to foreign influence and manipulation, and undermine our national security.\"Bores, in a statement to CNBC, fired back: \"I am someone with a master's in computer science, two patents, and nearly a decade working in tech. If they are scared of people who understand their business regulating their business, they are telling on themselves.\"Later Monday morning, Bores turned the super PAC's attack into a fundraising opportunity for his congressional primary campaign.\"If you don't want Trump mega-donors writing all tech policy, contribute to help us pushback,\" he wrote on X.Leading the Future is backed by venture capital giant Andreessen Horowitz, Palantir co-founder Joe Lonsdale, AI search-engine company Perplexity, SV Angel founder Ron Conway and numerous others.Read more CNBC politics coverageAI could be causing ‘quiet time’ in labor market, top Trump economic aide Hassett saysTrump reverses stance on Epstein records, presses Republicans to support releaseFormer Fed Gov.

    "body": " Chip Somodevilla | Getty ImagesIn Google's IPO prospectus 21 years ago, founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin gave a flattering nod to Warren Buffett, suggesting in their letter to prospective investors that the billionaire investor was a big influence.They titled their founders' letter, \"'An owner's manual' for Google's shareholders,\" and indicated that there was a footnote worth reading.\"Much of this was inspired by Warren Buffett's essays in his annual reports and his 'An Owner's Manual' to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders,\" the footnote said.More than two decades later, Buffett is showing that the admiration goes both ways. Berkshire Hathaway, Buffett's holding company, revealed late Friday that it owns a stake in Google parent Alphabet worth roughly $4.3 billion as of the end of the third quarter, making it the firm's 10th largest equity holding. It marks one of Berkshire's most significant technology bets in years — Apple's is the firm's largest holding — and sent sent Alphabet shares up 3% on Monday.It's a rare move by Berkshire, which for decades has hesitated to buy into high-growth tech companies, and represents the first time the firm is known to have a stake in Google. Buffett, 95, is stepping down as CEO at the end of this year, with longtime lieutenant Greg Abel set to take the reins.In 2017, Buffett said he regretted not buying shares in Google years earlier when Berkshire insurance subsidiary Geico was paying hefty fees for advertising on its network. He also acknowledged missing out on Amazon, which Berkshire eventually purchased in 2019, still owning $2.2 billion worth of the e-commerce shares.watch nowAlphabet shares are up 50% this year, after Monday's gains, trading just shy of their all-time high reached last week. The company notched its first $100 billion revenue quarter in the third period, fueled by growth in its cloud unit, which houses its artificial intelligence services. The cloud division also has a $155 billion backlog from customers and an updated line of chips that sets it apart from other AI players.Alphabet's valuation remains lower than many of its AI-driven megacap peers. The stock trades at about 26 times next year's earnings, compared with Microsoft at 32, Broadcom at 51 and Nvidia at 42, according to FactSet.Page and Brin are now ranked seventh and eighth, respectively, on the Forbes billionaires list, just behind Buffett at sixth. The Google founders cited Buffett multiple times in the company's IPO prospectus. In one instance, Page and Brin were effectively warning investors that quarterly financials may not always look pretty. \"In our opinion, outside pressures too often tempt companies to sacrifice long term opportunities to meet quarterly market expectations,\" they wrote. \"In Warren Buffett's words, 'We won't \"smooth\" quarterly or annual results: If earnings figures are lumpy when they reach headquarters, they will be lumpy when they reach you.'\"In explaining the logic behind a dual-class stock structure, which gave the founders outsized voting control, they cited Berkshire as one of the companies to previously and successfully implement it, along with media companies like The New York Times, the Washington Post (the newspaper now owned by Jeff Bezos) and Wall Street Journal publisher Dow Jones (now owned by News Corp.)\"Media observers have pointed out that dual class ownership has allowed these companies to concentrate on their core, long term interest in serious news coverage, despite fluctuations in quarterly results,\" Page and Brin wrote. \"Berkshire Hathaway has implemented a dual class structure for similar reasons.\"WATCH: Berkshire discloses new Alphabet state worth $4.3 billion. watch now",

Friar later walked back that comment.Hassett's comments also come as Trump and his allies have tried to refocus their messaging on affordability, after Democratic candidates who homed in on that issue won big in major elections earlier this month.Hassett said Monday that overall grocery prices have not come down during Trump's second term, despite the president's claims otherwise.\"People still are trying to dig out from the big hole that was dug by the previous administration's policies,\" he said.The cost of an average monthly grocery haul shot up during the Biden administration and \"it's gone up almost not at all\" since Trump returned to the White House, he said.Hassett added that \"purchasing power has gone up.\"\"It's just kind of astonishing to me that the cost problem is somehow being blamed on us,\" he said.",

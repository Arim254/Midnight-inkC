    "body": "Still from Disney's \"Avatar: Fire and Ash.\"DisneyThe opening weekend for Disney's \"Avatar: Fire and Ash\" was less of a blaze and more of a simmer.And that's the expectation for the full theatrical run of the third installment in James Cameron's Avatar franchise. During its first three days in theaters, \"Fire and Ash\" tallied $88 million, falling well shy of analysts' expectations, which called for a debut haul between $110 million and $125 million. For comparison, 2022's \"Avatar: The Way of Water\" brought in $134 million during the same three-day period.Internationally, the film collected $257 million, bringing the film's global opening to an estimated $345 million.\"Fire and Ash\" faced some theatrical headwinds, namely its over-three-hour runtime. There was also less pent-up demand compared to \"The Way of Water,\" which was released more than a decade after the first Avatar film. Some box office analysts and critics noted that \"Fire and Ash\" has less technological innovation than its predecessors, which had been a driving factor in past ticket sales.Around 5.2 million domestic moviegoers went to see \"Fire and Ash,\" according to data from EntTelligence, a massive decline from the 8.7 million that ventured out in 2022 to see the opening weekend of \"The Way of Water.\"Still, the Avatar franchise has never been front-loaded at the box office. The first film, 2009's \"Avatar,\" generated just $77 million in its opening weekend domestically, but stayed in theaters for nearly a year. By the time it exited theaters, the film had generated $2.7 billion globally. With re-releases, the film now stands at $2.9 billion, according to data from Comscore.\"The Way of Water\" ran in theaters for 23 weeks and has grossed $2.3 billion globally.\"With less than two weeks remaining in the box office year, the pressure on 'Avatar: Fire And Ash' to deliver big was intense and though the film may have come in a bit below pre-release opening weekend projections, the Avatar films have always been known for their marathon box office trajectories,\" said Paul Dergarabedian, head of marketplace trends at Comscore.Also aiding the franchise at the box office are premium large-format ticket sales. The Avatar films have over-indexed with the more expensive experiential screens like IMAX and Dolby as well as 3D showings. Disney reported that 3D and premium theaters accounted for 66% of the weekend total.While 3D films have fallen out of favor with domestic audiences, they remain popular internationally —especially in China. Indeed, \"Avatar\" made the bulk of its money outside the U.S., with a whopping $2.08 billion coming from overseas.",

We appreciate your patience and will provide further updates as soon as they are available.\"Waymo notice of service outage in San Francisco. Source: WaymoAs power outages spread yesterday, videos shared on social media appeared to show multiple Waymo vehicles stalled in traffic in different parts of the city.San Francisco resident Matt Schoolfield said he saw at least three Waymo autonomous vehicles stopped in traffic Saturday around 9:45 p.m. local time, including one he photographed near Arguello Boulevard and Geary Street. \"They were just stopping in the middle of the street,\" Schoolfield said.A Waymo vehicle stuck between Parker and Beaumont on the north side in san francisco.Credit: Matt SchoolfieldThe power outages began around 1:09 p.m. Saturday and peaked roughly two hours later, affecting about 130,000 customers, according to Pacific Gas and Electric. As of Sunday morning, about 21,000 customers remained without power, mainly in the Presidio, the Richmond District, Golden Gate Park and parts of downtown San Francisco.PG&E said the outage was caused by a fire at a substation that resulted in \"significant and extensive\" damage, and said it could not yet provide a precise timeline for full restoration.San Francisco Mayor Daniel Lurie said in a 9 p.m. update on X that police officers, fire crews, parking control officers and city ambassadors were deployed across affected neighborhoods as transit service gradually resumed. \"Waymo has also paused service,\" Lurie said.Amid the disruption, Tesla CEO Elon Musk posted on X: \"Tesla Robotaxis were unaffected by the SF power outage.\"Unlike Waymo, Tesla does not operate a driverless robotaxi service in San Francisco.Tesla's local ride-hailing service uses vehicles equipped with \"FSD (Supervised),\" a premium driver assistance system. The service requires a human driver behind the wheel at all times. According to state regulators — including the California Department of Motor Vehicles and California Public Utilities Commission — Tesla has not obtained permits to conduct driverless testing or services in the state without human safety supervisors behind the wheel, ready to steer or brake at any time.Tesla is vying to become a robotaxi titan, but does not yet operate commercial, driverless services. Tesla's Robotaxi app allows users to hail a ride; however, its vehicles currently have human safety supervisors or drivers on board, even in states where the company has obtained permits for driverless operations. Waymo, which leads the nascent industry in the West, is Tesla's chief competitor in AVs, along with Chinese players like Baidu-owned Apollo Go.The outage-related disruptions in San Francisco come as robotaxi services are becoming more common in other major U.S. cities. Waymo is among a small number of companies operating fully driverless ride-hailing services for the public, even as unease about autonomous vehicles remains high.A survey by the American Automobile Association earlier this year found that about two-thirds of U.S. drivers said they were fearful of autonomous vehicles.The Waymo pause in San Francisco indicates cities are not yet ready for highly automated vehicles to inundate their streets, said Bryan Reimer, a research scientist at the MIT Center for Transportation and co-author of \"How to Make AI Useful.\"\"Something in the design and development of this technology was missed that clearly illustrates it was not the robust solution many would like to believe it is,\" he said.Reimer noted that power outages are entirely predictable. \"Not for eternity, but in the foreseeable future, we will need to mix human and machine intelligence, and have human backup systems in place around highly automated systems, including robotaxis,\" he said.State and city regulators will need to consider what the maximum penetration of highly automated vehicles should be in their region, Reimer added, and AV developers should be held responsible for \"chaos gridlock,\" just as human drivers would be held responsible for how they drive during a blackout.Waymo did not say when its service would resume and did not specify whether collisions involving its vehicles had occurred during the blackout.Tesla and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration did not immediately respond to requests for comment.This is a developing story.

    "body": "Capsule hotels are a cheap alternative to expensive accomodation in London for office workers.Sawdah BhaimiyaWorkers who moved out of London for remote work are under pressure to come back to the office in the city, and some are choosing to stay in Japanese-inspired sleeping pods for just £30 ($40). I travelled to Piccadilly Circus in the heart of London to spend a night in a newly opened capsule hotel, after two of my colleagues who live outside the city recommended staying there. Zedwell Capsule Hotel, a brand owned by Criterion Capital, opened in September and offers nearly 1,000 capsules measuring 1 meter long, 1 meter wide, and 2 meters in depth — likely the smallest hotel rooms in London. It has a rather unassuming exterior despite being located inside the historic London Pavilion building — originally built as a music hall in 1885. The entrance is around the corner of the busy station, through some black doors.Private sleeping capsules alongside each other in Zedwell Capsule Hotel in London.Sawdah BhaimiyaThe cost of staying in a hotel in Central London is staggering, sitting at an average of £265 per night in the third quarter of 2025, according to real estate firm Knight Frank. In comparison, the average daily rate of hotels across Europe was 125 euros in the summer, according to an analysis of over 600,000 reservations from 2,000 independent hotels by RoomRaccoon. Criterion's Head of Hotels Halima Aziz told me that the capsule hotel addresses a gap in the market between budget hostels and affordable accommodation. \"We've formed this sweet spot between the two. We're not a budget hostel. We're not coming in at a £15 rate, giving you a bunk bed in a steel room,\" she said. \"When we decided to get into capsules, we really took inspiration from Asia, and the capsule concept was really born out of Japan as a response to very similar pressures we're facing in London.\" In Japan, the first capsule hotel was built in the city of Osaka in 1979, primarily to serve as an inexpensive overnight option for salarymen who worked late and preferred to stay out drinking and socializing rather than spending more money commuting home. It's given rise to some capsule-style hotels in New York, from sleeping pods by Kama Central Park, to Nap York, a sleeping station with private pods for short naps or overnight stays. Now that the concept has come to London, I was keen to see for myself what the British version has to offer.Inside a sleeping capsuleInside a sleeping capsule in Zedwell Capsule Hotel in London.Sawdah BhaimiyaIt's a Monday evening, and instead of my usual work-from-home routine, which involves preparing to go into the office the next day, I'm crawling into a brightly lit sleeping pod.I roll down the garage-like shutters and lock it from the inside as I prepare to sleep. My head is just inches beneath the ceiling of my pod, which has a light dimmer, two clothing hooks, an air purifier, a wide mirror stretching along the head of the capsule, and charger sockets. Although I can feel my luggage — a backpack and tote bag — at the end of my bed, and the bottom of my coat hung on the hooks, I'm surprised by how comfortable and cozy the bedding is. I switch off the lights and noisy air purifier and find myself enveloped by pitch black and silence. It feels eerie, but with nothing to distract me, I fall asleep quickly.Each capsule measures 1 meter long, 1 meter wide, and 2 meters in depth.Sawdah BhaimiyaEarlier in the day, I checked myself into the hotel using one of four kiosks, and as I roamed around the hotel, I noticed that the walls were painted black to match the exterior — and there isn't a single window in sight. I rode up to the first floor and used a key card to access my female-only dormitory. My capsule was one of seven stacked side by side or on top of each other, and some were only accessible via steps. A female-only dormitory inside Zedwell Capsule Hotel.Sawdah BhaimiyaI learned that despite the low initial cost, there was a series of additional amenities guests can pay for, from an extra £10 to be in a female-only dormitory, to £8 for a padlock, and £15 to store luggage securely. The hotel had an unfinished feel. The entrance was covered in scaffolding and the faint sound of drilling could be heard from inside the building. That's because it is \"still under construction,\" Zedwell's General Manager Greg Walsh told me. The drilling sounds were coming from underground where a larger reception was being built, with direct links to Piccadilly Circus Station. CEO Aziz confirmed that the building is not complete, adding that the additional cost for the female dorms was largely due to upgraded amenities, including a towel inside the pod and a female-only beauty room complete with hairdryers  — although this is still under construction and not currently accessible. \"Ultimately, if you're not just targeting the traditional hostel market, and you want to widen access, you need to respond to people's needs, and people have needs for laundry, for beauty, that wouldn't typically be considered,\" she added. While exploring the building, I found shared toilets and showers with classical music playing inside, as well as vending machines in the reception with snacks, drinks, slippers and eye masks amongst other items. I wandered out for dinner and with Oxford Circus, Leicester Square, and Covent Garden within walking distance, it wasn't hard to entertain myself. Zedwell Capsule Hotel is located in Piccadilly Circus, London.Sawdah BhaimiyaWorkers are coming back to the city During my time in the hotel, I discovered I was one of many working professionals in the building. I spotted several guests arriving in suits and ties and carrying briefcases. One chef from Newcastle even told me he paid a total of £284 to stay in the hotel for a fortnight to work in London. During the Covid-19 pandemic, many office workers in London moved out of the city, where it was cheaper to rent or own a home, due to remote and flexible working options becoming a normality. \"The cost of commuting from Oxford, Cambridge, city centers that aren't accessible via the London Underground system, is quite high.\"Halima AzizCriterion's Head of Hotels A 2021 report from City Hall said it was likely that London's population fell during the pandemic. The number of payrolled London employees dropped sharply by about 210,000 by November 2020, with the report citing that flexible work arrangements made it easier to move out of the city. The trend persisted, and by 2022, 43% of commuters lived over 30 minutes away from their workplace in the U.K., reflecting higher property prices in central areas, according to a report by commercial real estate firm CBRE which surveyed over 20,000 people globally.  Additionally, CBRE found that 41% of people worldwide were planning to move to more remote locations in the next two years either in the same city or to a different city. However, in 2025, there's been a sharp recall in remote work offerings with major companies enforcing return to office mandates in London from HSBC to JPMorgan, Amazon, Salesforce and John Lewis. A typically dormitory with roughly a dozen capsules inside Zedwell Capsule Hotel.Sawdah BhaimiyaZedwell's Aziz said one of the hotel's core demographics is young professionals and hybrid workers who are using Zedwell as a \"base in the city\" due to their flexible working patterns which require them to be in the office for a few days a week. Roughly 20% of the hotel's customers are corporate workers, Aziz said. \"The cost of commuting from Oxford, Cambridge, city centers that aren't accessible via the London Underground system, is quite high,\" she said. \"Our product is often cheaper than their commute or late-night travel home.\" The return-to-office mandate has left workers who don't live in cities scrambling to find inexpensive ways of staying in the city, without having to resort to unattractive options like hostels. \"Where they wouldn't traditionally consider a hostel product, we identified that they would indeed consider a capsule hotel, because it gave that privacy,\" Aziz added. As a Londoner, my usual commute to the office lasts just over 30 minutes, so the hotel doesn't offer much in terms of convenience for me, but I can see the appeal for those living further away from the city. When I awoke in the morning, I almost forgot that I wasn't in my bed at home. After a quick shower, I got ready inside my capsule before heading out and joining the throng of commuters in central London. ",

    "body": "Company: LKQ Corp. (LKQ)Business: LKQ engages in the distribution of replacement parts, components, and systems used in the repair and maintenance of vehicles and specialty vehicle aftermarket products and accessories. The company operates through four segments: wholesale-North America, Europe, specialty, and self service. It offers bumper covers, automotive body panels, and lights, as well as paint and paint-related consumables for refinishing vehicles; mechanical automotive parts and accessories; salvage products, including mechanical and collision parts comprising engines; transmissions; door assemblies; sheet metal products, such as trunk lids, fenders, and hoods; and lights and bumper assemblies. The company also provides scrap metal and other materials to metals recyclers; precious metals contained in certain of our recycled parts, such as catalytic converters; and brake pads, discs and sensors, clutches, steering and suspension products, filters, and oil and automotive fluids, as well as electrical products. It serves collision and mechanical repair shops, and new and used car dealerships, as well as retail customers. LKQ was incorporated in 1998 and is headquartered in Antioch, Tennessee.Stock Market Value: $7.66 billion ($30.15 per share)Activist: Ananym Capital ManagementOwnership: 0.39%Average Cost: n/aActivist Commentary: Ananym Capital Management is a New York-based activist investment firm which launched on Sept. 3, 2024, and is run by Charlie Penner (a former partner at JANA Partners and head of shareholder activism at Engine No. 1) and Alex Silver (a former partner and investment committee member at P2 Capital Partners). Ananym looks for high quality but undervalued companies, regardless of industry. They would prefer to work amicably with their portfolio companies but are willing to launch a proxy fight as a last resort. According to their most recent 13F filing, they manage $260 million across 10 positions.What's happeningOn Oct. 21, Ananym Capital called on LKQ to divest its European operations and refocus on its North American business.Behind the scenesLKQ is a leading distributor of aftermarket vehicle parts. Its core North America segment (40% of revenue and 55% of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) primarily supplies aftermarket collision parts, such as mirrors and bumpers. The Europe segment (47% of revenue/38% of EBITDA) primarily supplies mechanical and suspension products but contains a wide variety of other replacement and maintenance products. Although the European business is slightly larger by revenue, the North American business has significantly higher margins and a much larger market share compared with its peers. Lastly, the specialty segment (13% of revenue/7% of EBITDA) provides aftermarket parts for the RV market. Originally just a U.S. aftermarket parts business, the company began aggressively pursuing acquisitions in Europe starting in 2011, shifting from a focus on recycled parts consolidation to building and integrating a European footprint. Moreover, these two businesses are not nearly as similar as they sound, in North America they do primarily aftermarket collision parts like mirrors and bumpers and in Europe, it's primarily mechanical suspension and things under the hood.LKQ is no stranger to shareholder activism. In September 2019, when the stock was trading at $27 per share, ValueAct Capital engaged the company and settled for a board seat for one of its partners. Through this campaign, ValueAct was able to usher in a new wave of operational discipline, where instead of focusing on European M&A, LKQ paused large acquisitions and shifted its focus to growing the company's free cash flow and executing buybacks at an attractive discount. The results of this campaign speak for themselves, as LKQ's share price rose to over $60 during ValueAct's campaign, giving them an 86.39% return on their investment versus 16.15% for the Russell 2000. However, following ValueAct's exit, LKQ returned to its old ways, shifting their focus back to M&A, and the stock had subsequently declined more than 25% by February 2025, when two new activists entered the stock. In an uninspired campaign and settlement, those activists quickly settled for two board seats for independent directors and the stock has declined by 20% in the eight months since while the Russell 2000 has been up more than 7% during the same time.Now with the stock just slightly higher than it was in 2019 when ValueAct engaged, a third activist has entered to take over where ValueAct had left off, calling on LKQ to divest its European operations and refocus on its North American business. LKQ has always been a company that has benefited from simplification and harmed by complexity – and Ananym's plan seems to align with this approach: (i) halt major M&A, (i) divest the European business and other non-core assets, and (iii) use the proceeds to fund buybacks and reinvest in organic growth in the core NA segment. Operationally, there are several benefits to Ananym's plan. While the U.S. functions as a single market with consistent regulations, Europe is a series of nation states each with their own regulatory framework, making integration far more complex. This creates meaningful execution risks, exemplified by the company still needing to integrate more than 20 ERP systems in 18 different countries. Not only would divesting Europe leave the company with a higher margin business with a much larger relative market share, but it would also allow management to devote all their time and resources to North America. The alternative is to continue to focus a disproportionate amount of time on integrating all the European acquisitions across the different European countries all from their headquarters in Chicago and Nashville.The opportunity here is also clear from a valuation perspective. Industrial distribution peers typically trade at mid-teens or higher EBITDA multiples, while LKQ currently trades at 7.3x forward EBITDA. Not only is this a discount to the market, but to its historical levels, as even in its messy conglomerate form, LKQ has still traded on a 10-year historical average of 10x EBITDA. The European business could potentially be sold at an 8 to 9x multiple, but a sale even at the company's current multiple would be beneficial to unlocking value in the North American business, which could re-rate to its historical multiple of 10x EBITDA. The proceeds from such a sale could enable LKQ to repurchase up to 40% of its outstanding shares, which, when combined with the re-rating of NA, could easily translate to more than 60% upside from the company's current share price. While strategics with similar models, such as O'Reilly, AutoZone, and Genuine Parts, may find the European business appealing, strategics generally prefer clean businesses and this is far from that. Private equity, on the other hand, feasts on these types of projects, using their operational and restructuring expertise and flexibility of being out of the public eye to unlock these complex assets overtime in a way that is more difficult for public companies to address.In its short history, Ananym has established a reputation for striving to work amicably with management to create value for shareholders, and this situation appears to be no different. The fund has been largely complimentary of LKQ CEO Justin Jude who was named to the position in July 2024 and has his roots in the North American business. Under his short leadership, the company has already taken steps in the right direction — announcing plans to repurchase 14% of outstanding shares and divesting non-core assets such as its self-service salvage business that was sold in August to private equity. It has also signaled that its specialty business is on the market and it's expected to be sold in the near term. However, Jude seems to be a little more attached to the European business than these other businesses. Persuading him to divest Europe may take a little more time. If we learned anything from the previous activist campaigns at LKQ, this company needs a financially astute shareholder representative, not an independent industry executive. They do not need someone to help them with operations, they need someone to help them financially model, evaluate and potentially execute strategic options and work with the board to arrive at what is best for shareholders. Given Ananym's reputation as an amicable activist and their constructive relationship with Jude thus far, we think this is a perfect opportunity to put an Ananym representative on the board like Alex Silver who has extensive financial and private equity experience and brings a team of analysts ready to model available opportunities.Ken Squire is the founder and president of 13D Monitor, an institutional research service on shareholder activism, and the founder and portfolio manager of the 13D Activist Fund, a mutual fund that invests in a portfolio of activist investments.",

    "body": "Nandi Owolo's first foray into junk journaling came by accident.One day in June 2024, Owolo fell while walking her dog. \"I started junk journaling because I broke my foot on my birthday, of all days,\" she tells CNBC Make It.She was homebound on doctor's orders for two months of recovery. Then, by way of some TikTok scrolling, junk journaling came into her life.The L.A. resident says junk journaling, described as \"as a cross between scrapbooking, creative journaling and collage art,\" made her feel crafty for the first time in her life. \"I personally think that I have no artistic skill,\" says Owolo, now 30. \"I can't draw; I can't knit; I can't paint.\" Arranging and gluing down souvenirs, photos and stickers into chaotically colorful spreads? That she could do.Junk journaling, also considered \"Gen Z's version of scrapbooking,\" has taken off in recent years. Enthusiasts say they like that the hobby keeps them off their phones. It taps into the nostalgia of collecting and displaying physical media. And there are no rules in arranging personal mementos from the grand, like concert tickets or birthday cards, to the everyday, like a restaurant napkin or coffee sleeve.The hobby is \"one man's trash is another man's treasure\" come to life, and its embrace of imperfection is part of the appeal, Owolo says: \"It's an artistic medium in which you can do whatever you want with the page,\" she says.Junk journaling, a cross between scrapbooking, creative journaling and collage art, has taken off in recent years thanks to enthusiasts wanting a screen-free creative hobby.Courtesy of Nandi OwoloAdd in an element of in-person gathering, which many young people are craving post-pandemic, and Owolo says she felt she had a hit on her hands.Two months after beginning her own crafting journey, Owolo launched the social media handles for Junk Journal Club and hosted her first meetup through a local social club where she was a member. The event quickly reached maximum capacity at 35 people, which Owolo says signaled to her that there was a big demand.Owolo soon held her second event at a park with 60 people. A year and a half later, she now regularly hosts ticketed events for 20 to 30 guests at $35 to $50 a pop between one and three times per month. Owolo says she believes her Junk Journal Club is the first U.S. club dedicated to hosting real-life events for the hobby. She also launched a Discord channel for users around the world to connect, share inspiration, post their pages and send each other care packages via a pen pal program. The group now boasts nearly 2,000 members around the U.S. and internationally, including Canada, Germany, Australia and beyond.From job loss to entrepreneurshipMay 2025 marked a turning point for Owolo and her Junk Journal Club. The entertainment professional lost what she calls her \"dream job\" working to turn books and comics into TV shows and movies.While grieving the \"heartbreaking layoff,\" Owolo says she recognized an opportunity in Junk Journal Club.\"As cliche as it is, it's like I had this other thing that I had more control over,\" she says. \"No one can lay me off from Junk Journal Club. It is mine.\"Owolo got to work figuring out how she wanted to grow the business and decided to go after branded events. She set a goal to collaborate with two brands by the end of 2025.Nandi Owolo launched Junk Journal Club in August 2024 and turned it into her full-time business in 2025. She hosts one to three events each month, which often sell out quickly.Courtesy of Nandi OwoloShe found her first partner in Nuuly, the clothing rental service, which came about from \"sheer emailing and networking,\" Owolo says. The brand covered the cost of supplies and other fees for an event in November, making it free for guests. It was also the first time Owolo was paid as a creator to make several Instagram Reels videos for the clothing company's social media feeds.Throughout the fall, Owolo says she hosted five collaborative events, including with artist and creative director Ramisha Sattar, Australia-based artist and author Martina Calvi (whom Owolo calls the \"junk journaling queen\"), and Paramount Pictures to promote its movie \"Regretting You.\"There's so much overwhelming noise in the world right now. Junk journaling is a great way to quiet that noise.Nandi OwoloOwolo says she was reluctant to call herself an entrepreneur as someone who had, up until now, never tried to make money from a side hustle.\"It almost felt fraudulent,\" Owolo says. She questioned herself: \"Am I allowed to call myself an entrepreneur? Am I allowed to call this a business? And eventually I was like, 'I absolutely am allowed to call it that.' It just took a while.\"Growing the business in 2026Owolo says she's still actively applying for a new full-time role in marketing and brand management, and that she hopes hiring managers will see her work with Junk Journal Club as an asset. She's currently working a contract job for a beverage company to fill in for someone on maternity leave, though that ends in January.She says that she isn't taking a salary from Junk Journal Club and that all ticket sales go back into the events themselves to cover supplies for attendees, food and drink, the venue rental, and a goodie box with stationery and stickers for guests to take home afterward.Owolo says her goal is to be able to pay herself from Junk Journal Club, but that for now, she's focused on giving \"people the best experience possible.\"\"I recognize that there is a way that I could have hosted all these events and paid myself a little bit of money,\" she says, \"but it would have been at the sacrifice of less sticker sheets, or not getting a custom thing made for the event. I've not yet reached the point where I'm willing to sacrifice those things.\"Owolo intends to grow slowly and intentionally. Though she says her events tend to sell out, usually within an hour of tickets going live and as fast as under a minute, she prefers to cap gatherings at 20 to 30 guests to curate a cozy atmosphere.Looking ahead to 2026, Owolo says she hopes to land more brand partnerships for collaborative projects.Junk Journal Club events usually accommodate 20 to 30 attendees. Tickets often sell out within an hour, or as quickly as a few minutes, of going on sale.Ximena Escobar\"L.A. is the land of activations and experiential marketing,\" she says. To touring musicians, she proposes, why not work with her on an event where eager fans create a collage inspired by their favorite song? Or for the many brands that host influencer dinners, might a junk journaling session pair well with dessert?In the meantime, Owolo expects the appetite for in-person crafting will only grow.\"There's so much overwhelming noise in the world right now,\" she says. \"Junk journaling is a great way to quiet that noise.\"Want to give your kids the ultimate advantage? You teach them to read and ride a bike, but often skip money management.

Elizabeth Frantz | ReutersU.S. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said she was suspending the diversity visa program at President Donald Trump's direction, saying the man suspected of killing two students at Brown University and a MIT professor had been granted one.Noem posted on X late Thursday that she had instructed the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services to pause the (DV1) program \"to ensure no more Americans are harmed by this disastrous program.\"On Dec. 13, two students died and nine others were injured when someone opened fire at the physics building at Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island. Police later identified Portuguese national Claudio Manuel Neves Valente, 48, as the suspect.Valente was a former student at the university and had been enrolled in a Ph.D. program in physics in 2000, the university's president, Christina H. Paxson, said. Valente is also suspected of having killed MIT physics professor Nuno Loureiro, 47, in his home in Brookline, Massachusetts, two days after the Brown shooting. Valente and Loureiro are believed to have attended the same university in their native Portugal.Authorities announced the suspect's identity hours after Valente was found dead in a New Hampshire storage facility on Thursday, Providence Police Chief Oscar Perez said. Guns were also found at the scene.\"There's no longer a threat to the public,\" the U.S. attorney's office in Boston said in a statement after Valente's death was confirmed. Authorities believe Valente acted alone and have not disclosed a motive for the killings. Noem said that Valente entered the U.S. through the DV1 program in 2017 and was granted a green card.\"In 2017, President Trump fought to end this program, following the devastating NYC truck ramming by an ISIS terrorist, who entered under the DV1 program, and murdered eight people,\" she wrote on X.The Diversity Immigrant Visa Program (DV Program) allocates up to 50,000 immigrant visas every year, according to the USCIS website.The program is a lottery. Visas are randomly allocated to individuals from countries with low rates of immigration to the U.S.— Dan Mangan contributed to this report.",

    "body": "It's important to build resilience, but how do we actually do it? I've spent 15 years researching happiness, and I've interviewed thousands of people about what makes it possible for them to thrive. I've learned that resilience isn't something you're born with. It's not even about bouncing back, a concept that often does more harm than good. Real resilience is about building specific habits that train your brain to weather difficulty without breaking. Here are 9 habits that actually work:1. Reframing stress as a signal, not a threatIf your heart is racing before your big meeting, your instinct might be to panic. Before you do, pause and tell yourself: \"I'm excited about this.\"I know it sounds like toxic positivity. It's not. Research shows that this simple reframing, shifting from a threat to a challenge, can change your physiological response. Your body doesn't easily distinguish between anxiety and excitement. The only difference is your interpretation. 2. Making one micro-decision daily with confidenceWhen you constantly second-guess yourself, your brain learns that you can't be trusted to handle outcomes. Confident micro-decisions can help rewire your brain and boost your trust in yourself.So pick your lunch without researching five options. Commit to a movie in two minutes flat. Send the email without editing it 10 times. This teaches your brain: \"I can decide and handle what comes next, even if it's not perfect.\" That's the exact skill you need in a crisis. 3. Building your support system with intentionIt's extremely difficult to maintain deep relationships with hundreds of people. Research has found we can manage about 150 stable relationships, but only about five truly intimate ones. The most emotionally resilient people don't spread their emotional energy thin or try to handle everything alone. They invest in these core relationships. And when things do get hard, they have people in their corner who can help them carry the weight. 4. Creating a 'done' list instead of a to-do listMost of us focus on what's left undone. It's a perpetual sense of failure. I want you to flip this.Every day, write down what you actually accomplished, even the small stuff. Over time, your brain stops noticing gaps and starts noticing progress. That shift is where resilience lives.5. Noticing and savoring one good moment every dayWhen you deliberately pay attention to positive moments, you rewire neural pathways for happiness. Pick one moment a day worth savoring. A good conversation. A small win. Really good coffee. Spend 30 seconds actually noticing it. This practice counteracts your brain's obsession with what's wrong and builds psychological resilience, one moment at a time.6. Practicing honesty in your closest relationshipsBe vulnerable with the people who matter to you. Tell someone about a real challenge. Ask for honest feedback, not just agreement. Have conversations where things might get uncomfortable.The most resilient people feel safe to be themselves without fear of judgement. Being open with people who you trust can help build that muscle. 7. Helping someone else, before you need helpThis sounds counterintuitive until you realize that helping others is a powerful recharge practice. Plus, you're building your support system for the future. You're reinforcing your identity as capable and resourceful.Most importantly, you remember that resilience is also about contributing and mattering to other people.8. Asking yourself, 'What's the worst that could happen?'Most people avoid this question because they are afraid of the answer. But research shows that actually imagining the worst-case scenario can reduce anxiety, not increase it.So after you ask yourself, \"What's the worst that could happen?\" actually sit with the question. Then ask yourself, \"Could I handle that?\" The answer is usually yes. Maybe not easily, but yes.The most resilient people understand that bad things can happen, but the most important thing is to be confident that you can handle them when they do.9. Practicing these habits in low-stakes momentsEmotional resilience is a skill you can hone. It doesn't require therapy, meditation retreats, or years of work. Start with just one or two of these habits. Reframe stress when the stakes are low. Build your support relationships now, not when you're desperate. Make confident decisions about small things, so you're ready for big things.Jessica Weiss is a keynote speaker and executive coach who teaches people and businesses how to find more happiness, fulfillment and satisfaction at work.

    "body": "watch nowBuild-A-Bear Workshop wasn't always a retail winner.The toy store, known for its interactive experience of building and accessorizing stuffed animals, has gone through a significant turnaround since CEO Sharon Price John took the helm of the company over a decade ago.\"When I first came in 2013, that assessment of the brand was strong,\" she told CNBC. \"We don't have a broken brand, we have a broken business, and when you started doing interviews, you really understood how much this brand meant to people.\"The company found initial success in malls in the early 2000s, but Build-A-Bear's stock plunged after the 2008 financial crisis, with the company reporting a $49 million loss in fiscal 2012.Under Price John, the company began investing in e-commerce, shifting orders to stores instead of its distribution center and diversifying its sales beyond just malls to turn around the company.\"Our goal overall was to create sustained, profitable growth, but the profitable was first,\" Price John said.That strategy worked. Virtually all of Build-A-Bear's stores are now profitable, and the stock experienced an Nvidia-like run earlier this year, hitting an all-time high of about $76 in September. The stock has come down some since then, but it's still up more than 125% over the past two years.But tariffs have taken a hit to the business. Build-A-Bear imports over 90% of its products from China and Vietnam, and the company said in its third-quarter earnings report in early December that it expects to take a roughly $11 million hit from tariffs for fiscal 2025.Company executives also said on a call with analysts that the company experienced a slowdown in traffic in October during the government shutdown.Small Cap Consumer Research analyst Eric Beder wrote in a note this month that the firm was lowering projections and reducing its price target by $10 due to the company reporting lighter-than-expected revenue and the \"implied deep tariff impacts.\"Still, the company is outperforming most of its retail competitors, expecting to reach $500 million in annual revenue for the first time.\"You can buy stuffed animals or a plush pretty much everywhere, right from Target to FAO Schwarz and every place in between,\" Beder told CNBC. \"The difference is that at Build-A-Bear, it's yours.

    "body": "watch nowLucid Motors gets rave reviews from critics. But it's sorely lacking customers.    That's a problem the company can't afford. The Arizona-based EV maker has top-shelf tech, deep-pocketed backers, and highly praised cars. However, it has struggled to meet production targets, and has been unable to steal the spotlight away from established luxury brands with century-old pedigrees. Lucid is ramping up production of its high-end, three-row, Gravity SUV, though it has sold only a few hundred units so far in 2025. The Gravity's production ramp has faced a slew of challenges, primarily supply chain shortages. Yet the company already has plans for another vehicle aimed more at the middle of the market, where it would compete with the top-selling Tesla Model Y SUV. And it's investing in self-driving cars for consumers while working on a robotaxi fleet with Uber and self-driving tech maker Nuro. A Lucid Gravity coming off the line at the company's factory in Casa Grande, ArizonaIn the process, Lucid is burning through a lot of money. The company's third-quarter results were worse than Wall Street expected, with a net loss of close to $1 billion.  \"Their gross profit has been getting kind of worse,\" said Tom Narayan, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets. \"A lot of people are doing the math. How long can the company keep losing cash?\"Adding to its challenges is a tougher environment for all EV manufacturers. Demand has fallen short of expectations, and many automakers are pulling back. EVs have lost key support from the federal government, including a $7,500 tax credit, funding for charging, and restrictions on state level programs that incentivize automakers to produce zero-emission vehicles. A 'fantastic car'Lucid's first vehicle, a sedan call the Air, is the most popular vehicle in its segment, according to Cox Automotive. Through the third quarter, it was the third best-selling full-size luxury sedan, and the top selling electric one, according to the company. The Air is frequently a \"critic's pick.\" No other EV can touch the 512-mile range of the Air Grand Touring, one of its top trim levels.  Last year, Lucid delivered 10,241 vehicles, the majority of which were Air sedans, a 71% increase from 2023. U.S. EV leader Tesla delivered 1.8 million. Unfortunately, sedans have consistently compared to SUVs, crossovers, and pickups--which now all but dominate the roads. Of the top 10 best-selling models in the U.S., seven are from those three segments, according to Edmunds. \"It was a fantastic car,\" said Sam Abuelsamid, vice president of market research for Telemetry. \"It still is a fantastic car. But it came to market at kind of the wrong time.\"Marc Winterhoff, interim chief executive officer of Lucid Group Inc., in a Lucid Air Grand Touring model in San Francisco, California, US, on Thursday, July 17, 2025. Jason Henry | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesIn 2023, Tesla's Model Y was the best-selling vehicle in the world, according to JATO Dynamics. It sold more than 265,000 units in the U.S. through the third quarter of 2024, according to Cox Automotive, about 100,000 more than the Model 3 sedan. Among EVs, the Model 3 is unusually popular for a sedan. Behind the two Tesla Models, the three vehicles that round out the top five are crossovers — Chevrolet Equinox, Ford Mustang Mach-E and Hyundai Ioniq5. The Model S, the Air's closest Tesla competitor in terms of size, performance, and price, sold just over 4,500 units in the same period.  The highest volume EVs, such as the Model Y, are also less expensive than the Air, which starts just above $70,000 and runs up to about a quarter of a million dollars. The Model 3 is nearly half that. The average EV transaction price in November was just above $59,000, according to Cox Automotive. \"There's just not enough of a market for those premium electric sedans right now,\" Abuelsamid said. Lucid sold slightly more than 300 Gravity SUVs in the US through the third quarter of 2025, according to Cox Automotive. Like the Air, the Gravity has a high price tag. Nevertheless, the company has said the Gravity stands to attract six times as many customers as the Air. \"We'll see if that's the case,\" said Narayan. \"The latest numbers I've seen show it kind of equalizing the sales of sedans.\"Lucid interim CEO Mark Winterhoff told CNBC in an interview that the company has seen \"a very good uptick in demand when it comes to the Gravity as compared to the Air.\" He added that most customers are configuring the car in ways that run the price up above $100,000. Production troubleDemand might be strong, but Lucid also has to get the vehicle into customers' hands. Gravity's launch earlier in 2025 was beset by shortages of key materials like magnets, aluminum, and chips, Winterhoff said on the company's third-quarter earnings call.\"We haven't been able to produce as many as we wanted up until this point,\" Winterhoff told CNBC. \"We're very confident right now that we solved those problems.\"Deliveries have risen for seven straight quarters, culminating in a 47% percent jump over the third quarter of 2024. Lucid has added a second shift to the final assembly section of its factory to meet demand.The company said demand has been resilient despite worries the EV market is stalling after the federal EV incentive ended on Sept. 30.\"In October, our delivery numbers went up,\" Winterhoff said. \"Whereas in many other pure EV players or even EVs for incumbent players that also have [internal combustion] vehicles, the deliveries dropped down drastically.\"watch nowStill, analysts say it's a tougher time to make EVs than it was when Tesla was ramping up the Model 3 and Model Y. \"They were the only game in town,\" Narayan said. \"So there wasn't competition there. They also benefited from battery prices falling significantly. And they got a lot of government support. Today we're in a very different world.\" If gross profit does keep getting worse, the company will eventually have to return to investors, Narayan said. Lucid is currently about 55% owned by the Saudi Public Investment fund, according to FactSet.In the third quarter, Lucid and the PIF agreed to increase a delayed draw term loan credit facility from $750 million to roughly $2 billion. A DDTL is a loan the company can draw on over time, rather than all at once. That brings its total liquidity to $5.5 billion. The company has said it has enough to get through the first half of 2027.CNBC tours Lucid Motors factory in Casa Grande, Arizona.Andrew Evers\"So far, the Saudis have put many billions of dollars into Lucid, and they've been very patient through Lucid's struggles as they try to ramp up production and sales,\" said Abuelsamid. \"It's unclear how long they will continue to be patient.\"The company also received a $300 million investment from Uber in September to develop a platform for robotaxis with a third partner, autonomous driving tech developer Nuro. On top of that, Uber plans to buy 20,000 Gravity vehicles for the self-driving fleet. Separately, Lucid has a partnership with Nvidia to develop what it calls the \"the first true eyes-off, hands-off, and mind-off (L4) consumer owned autonomous vehicle.\" L4 means Level 4, nearly the highest level of autonomy in the current system devised by the Society for Automotive Engineers.\"You need to invest first and then you reap the benefits later on,\" Winterhoff said. \"And therefore we have to do a lot of things in parallel.\"Smaller SUV on the wayDespite Gravity's production challenges, the company is already at work on its next vehicle — a mid-size crossover priced closer to the industry average of about $50,000. This could boost volumes, but deepen losses. \"If gross profit is negative at a vehicle transacting around $100,000 or more on average, what Lucid's Air and Gravity are currently going for, what will it look like when the company is selling a vehicle that is closer to half of that?\" Narayan said. \"One answer could be, well, it's a much bigger scale, so you have better operating leverage,\" Narayan said. The argument, he said, is that Lucid's technology enables it to squeeze a lot more range out of a battery than competitors.\"Our vehicles are way more efficient by 30% to 40% than the competition, which means smaller battery use smaller battery to achieve the same range,\" said Emad Dlala, senior vice president of engineering and digital at Lucid. \"That means a lower [bill of materials] cost. That means better margins.\"Dlala said the Lucid Air Pure has a battery size of a Tesla Model Y, but has a range of 420 miles, about a hundred miles more than the Tesla Model Y. Lucid says the money it's spending goes to developing an array of technologies and manufacturing processes that are hard to copy. \"Lucid has about over 10 years of powertrain history,\" Dala said. \"This didn't come overnight. There's lots of IP patented technologies across powertrain, vehicle and software,\" which lead to \"gains in efficiency across the board,\" he said. Brand new Lucid electric cars sit parked in front of a Lucid Studio showroom in San Francisco on May 24, 2024.Justin Sullivan | Getty ImagesThat even extends to the way the cars are made. \"We use manufacturing processes here that no one else in the industry uses in powertrain,\" said Adrian Price, senior vice president of operations at Lucid.\"Lucid is very highly vertically integrated,\" he said, meaning it brings much of the car-making process in house. \"We have a lot more of our own subassemblies. That's also how we get the performance that other people don't. A lot of that engineering is outsourced by other major automakers. Not only do we do the engineering, but we also do the manufacturing, and we can control some of the Lucid secret sauce by doing it in-house.\"One area where Lucid appears to lag competitors is brand awareness. \"A lot of people don't know what Lucid is,\" Narayan said. \"That's the biggest, I think, hurdle that they have.\"The company has given more thought to marketing, and raising its profile in the luxury market, where it's going up against names like Mercedes-Benz, Porsche, and BMW. \"The buyer of a luxury brand, typically, they like things like heritage,\" Narayan said. \"The brand matters. So, you know, how do you create that from scratch?\"\"We are very well known and have tons of accolades in the motor press, Winterhoff said. \"So everybody who's interested in cars knows about it. But that's not the majority of vehicle buyers.\"So, it has begun a new marketing and advertising strategy for the Gravity, with Hollywood actor Timothee Chalamet as its first \"global brand ambassador.\" \"We're shifting from focusing on our vehicles, about the capabilities of our vehicles, to what does it mean to own a Lucid and what does it say about you?\" Winterhoff said. Winterhoff said he's confident the company can successfully ramp the Gravity, while building and eventually delivering its mid-size vehicle.  \"That is the point where I think this is a sustainable business going forward,\" he said. \"We have a clear plan also to profitability.\"Watch the video to get an exclusive inside look at Lucid's Gravity production and to find out what's next for the automaker.

    "body": "Photo from the Jeffrey Epstein files released by the U.S. Justice Department shows photos with prominent people including a Pope, Bill Clinton, and Donald Trump. Image was redacted by CNBC.U.S. Department of JusticeA photo showing President Donald Trump's face that was included in the release of the investigative files on notorious sex predator Jeffrey Epstein — and more than a dozen other files — appears to have been removed from the Department of Justice's website.The photo, released on Friday along with a slew of other files, shows a desk displaying a large assortment of framed and unframed photographs and other items. Among those photographs are at least two that clearly show Trump's face.Lawmakers on Saturday were quick to note that the image was missing from the DOJ website. \"This photo, file 468, from the Epstein files that includes Donald Trump has apparently now been removed from the DOJ release,\" Democrats on the House Oversight Committee said in a post on X. \"@AGPamBondi is this true? What else is being covered up? We need transparency for the American public.\"The photo featuring Trump was among the at least 16 files that disappeared from the site, the Associated Press reported Saturday.Friday's release included only some of the vast number of documents required to be disclosed under a deadline set by the Epstein Files Transparency Act, which mandated that the DOJ divulge all the files. The DOJ continued its partial release with more files tied to the investigation early Saturday.Congress is considering holding impeachment hearings about Attorney General Pam Bondi and Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche if the documents that were released don't comply with the law, Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., said Friday.\"What we need is a clear timeline of when the rest of the documents will be released and an explanation for why they did not release all of them today,\" Khanna said during a press conference following the files' release.Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., who co-sponsored the House bill with Khanna that ordered the Justice Department to release the files, on Saturday, accused the DOJ of openly disregarding the law.\"Compare Language of Epstein Files Transparency Act directing DOJ to provide internal communications regarding their decisions Versus DOJ letter to Congress asserting privilege to omit materials related to decisions, because they weren't specified by law,\" Massie wrote in a post on X.From left, Donald Trump and his girlfriend (and future wife), former model Melania Knauss, financier (and future convicted sex offender) Jeffrey Epstein, and British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell pose together at the Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Florida on Feb. 12, 2000.Davidoff Studios Photography | Archive Photos | Getty ImagesWhile Trump is a former friend of Epstein, the president has not been accused of wrongdoing. He has also denied being aware of Epstein's sexual abuse of underage girls and women.The appearance of Trump's name and image was noticeably scarce in the files made public Friday. Recently, however, Trump has been shown in a number of images that were released by House Democrats, who obtained the photos directly from Epstein's estate.The DOJ said in a post on X late Friday that it wasn't \"redacting the names of any politicians\" and cited comments made by Blanche reiterating such.\"The only redactions being applied to the documents are those required by law — full stop,\" Blanche said. \"Consistent with the statute and applicable laws, we are not redacting the names of individuals or politicians unless they are a victim.\"Blanche, who previously served as a criminal defense lawyer for Trump, echoed that sentiment in an interview with ABC News on Friday, saying that there has been \"no effort\" to redact any mention of the president in the files' release.The White House referred questions about the missing photo to the DOJ.CNBC has reached out to the Justice Department as well as House Oversight Committee Ranking Member Rep. Robert Garcia, D-Calif., for comment.Former President Bill Clinton appeared in several photos released Friday, and it is unclear when or where they were taken. One showed Clinton sitting in a chair next to a young woman, who sat on the chair's armrest.The former president has also not been accused of wrongdoing.Clinton's spokesman, Angel Urena, on Friday said, \"The White House hasn't been hiding these files for months only to dump them late on a Friday to protect Bill Clinton. This is about shielding themselves from what comes next, or from what they'll try and hide forever. So they can release as many grainy 20-plus-year-old photos as they want but this isn't about Bill Clinton.\"\"There are two types of people here. The first group knew nothing and cut Epstein off before his crimes came to light,\" Urena added. \"The second group continued relationships with him after. We're in the first. No amount of stalling by people in the second group will change that. Everyone, especially MAGA, expects answers, not scapegoats.\"— CNBC's Dan Mangan contributed to this report.",

    "body": "Jonathan Raa | Nurphoto | Getty ImagesChip giant Nvidia (NVDA) is considered to be one of the key beneficiaries of the artificial intelligence boom, thanks to robust demand for its advanced graphics processing units (GPUs). The stock has been under pressure recently due to concerns about valuations of AI plays and growing competition in the AI chip space from rivals like Broadcom (AVGO), Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) and Alphabet-owned Google's tensor processing units (TPUs). Nvidia is also facing uncertainty related to chip exports to China amid geopolitical tensions between Washington and Beijing. Despite ongoing pressures, several top analysts remain bullish on Nvidia for several reasons, including its solid track record, strong execution, continued innovation and dominant position in the AI GPU market. TipRanks' AI Analyst also has an \"outperform\" rating on NVDA stock with a price target of $205.Let's look at the views of three such Wall Street pros who are bullish on Nvidia's growth potential. Vivek Arya – Bank of AmericaFollowing a virtual meeting with Nvidia's vice president of investor relations, Toshiya Hari, Bank of America analyst Vivek Arya reiterated a buy rating on NVDA stock with a price forecast of $275, saying that he continues to view it as a top pick.Among the key takeaways, Arya mentioned that while Nvidia agrees that Gemini 3 is a top large language model (LLM) that is trained on Google's in-house TPU, the company contends that it is too early to declare a clear winner. Specifically, the company emphasized that the existing GPU-based LLMs available were all trained on old Hopper (2022) architecture and cannot be compared with the upcoming LLMs that are trained on NVDA's Blackwell (2024) GPUs.Arya highlighted that management is confident about the expected launch of the Blackwell-backed LLMs in early 2026, which would prove that \"they are at least a full generation ahead of competition.\" In fact, external benchmarks like MLPerf and InferenceMAX view Blackwell as the clear leader in both training and inference, with Nvidia standing out in terms of key metrics like tokens per watt and revenue per token.The five-star analyst added that Nvidia continues to have demand and supply visibility into at least $500 billion of revenue opportunity for Blackwell, Rubin and networking for calendar years 2025 to 2026. Interestingly, the recent deals with ChatGPT maker OpenAI and Anthropic/Microsoft are incremental to this $500 billion outlook (as they are letter of intents) and represent potential upside.Overall, the meeting reinforced Arya's bullish thesis, with the analyst finding NVDA stock's valuation attractive. Specifically, its price-to-earnings (P/E) multiples of 25x and 19x of 2026 and 2027 earnings, respectively, imply only a 0.5x PEG ratio. That's compared to the average of 2x for the Magnificent Seven stocks and growth competitors.Arya ranks No. 270 among more than 10,100 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been profitable 58% of the time, delivering an average return of 17.7%. Stacy Rasgon – BernsteinBernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon is also upbeat about Nvidia's prospects and has a buy rating on the semiconductor stock with a price target of $275. In his latest note to investors, the analyst discussed some interesting takeaways from his virtual investor meeting with Stewart Stecker, senior director of investor relations at Nvidia.Rasgon noted that the $500 billion outlook announced in October for cumulative Blackwell, Rubin and networking sales for calendar years 2025 and 2026 will likely see an upside, as it doesn't include new deals such as that with Anthropic, the OpenAI 10 GW collaboration, and partnerships in the Middle East.On concerns about competition from Google's in-house chips, Rasgon noted that while Nvidia acknowledges the progress that Google has made in more than 10 years, the company believes that it is about two years ahead of the search engine giant's TPU program.Nvidia argues that, given the evolving AI market, it will be challenging for Google to persuade cloud service providers to deploy TPUs as they are meant for specific model structures. \"But they believe NVIDIA's programmable platform solutions remain the best hardware for cloud AI infrastructure,\" said Rasgon.Regarding President Donald Trump's recent post about allowing Nvidia to ship H200 AI chips to China, subject to a 25% cut that goes to the U.S., Rasgon noted that Nvidia is still waiting to secure licenses to ship H200s, after which it intends to look into demand requests and commence manufacturing. Moreover, Nvidia has not yet obtained any details about the 25% revenue sharing with the U.S. government and is currently unclear about how this fee will be accounted for.Rasgon ranks No. 144 among more than 10,100 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been successful 67% of the time, delivering an average return of 27.3%. Blayne Curtis – JefferiesIn a research note on the 2026 outlook for semiconductors, Jefferies analyst Blayne Curtis reaffirmed a buy rating on Nvidia stock with a price target of $250. Curtis called Broadcom (AVGO) as the top pick, citing ASIC (application-specific integrated circuits) inflection and the highest level of estimate revisions expected for the company in the semiconductor group. That said, he remains bullish on Nvidia.\"We haven't given up on NVDA given the technology moat and valuation at 18x the $10 EPS bogey,\" said Curtis.The five-star analyst contends that ASIC adoption is still in its early phases, giving Nvidia plenty of room to grow amid robust spending. He thinks that ongoing worries about NVDA are overstated, given that Blackwell Ultra rollout is on track and Rubin is set to ramp in the second half of 2026.Furthermore, Curtis noted Nvidia's dominance in the AI chip space and expects the company's Vera-Rubin and NVLink 6 launches in the second half of 2026 to bolster its position. He expects Blackwell-backed LLMs to be introduced in the first half of 2026 and act as a potential catalyst for NVDA stock.Curtis also expects Nvidia's launch of its new CPX chip in the second half of 2026 to benefit from higher capital spending by hyperscalers and rising focus on inference. The analyst currently expects CPX to generate revenue of $13 billion in calendar year 2027. Based on all these positives, Curtis raised his 2026 and 2027 earnings per share (EPS) estimates for Nvidia to $7.82 and $9.50 from $6.83 and $9.03, respectively.Curtis ranks No. 58 among more than 10,100 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been profitable 64% of the time, delivering an average return of 27.8%.",

    "body": "For couples, \"holidays are a scary time\" because they often call for revealing a new side of yourself to your partner, says Sabrina Romanoff, New York-based psychologist and a relationship expert for dating app Hily. Some people have decades-long, big family traditions they want to uphold. Others prefer to keep it low key. Whatever the activities are, and whatever the meaning behind them, opening up about what matters to you can feel very vulnerable.  Ultimately, the goal is to blend \"each other's cultures and worlds,\" says Romanoff. Here's how successful couples tackle this festive time of year. They're 'direct and honest' about what they want First, each partner has to know what they want and be open about it.Do they want their partner to join them for their family Christmas? Do they want to take some time off and have a quiet Hanukkah? \"You are better off being direct and honest with your partner so you both can really get what you both need,\" says Romanoff.Ultimately, there will likely have to be some flexibility, on both sides. \"I think the healthiest couples are those who can get creative and compromise,\" she says. \"There's only one Christmas Eve, there's only one Christmas Day.\" Maybe this year, the couple spends time with one side's family and next year they spend time with the other. They create new traditions togetherSecond, successful couples create new traditions together. \"That could mean going to see the tree together a Rockefeller Center,\" says Romanoff, \"or getting an ornament together.\" It could mean cooking a holiday meal or doing a hot chocolate crawl. Building something new together is a bonding experience. \"I think that's what brings security\" in the relationship, she says.Want to give your kids the ultimate advantage?

    "body": "Most parents know the frustration of dealing with a child's unexpected public tantrum.But parents are often too quick to call out their child's negative behavior — chastising them for that unnecessary meltdown or even telling them to \"cheer up\" when they seem sad — while ignoring the underlying emotions behind those actions, according to parenting expert Reem Raouda.Focusing solely on children's behaviors, particularly bad behavior, rather than investigating and validating their emotions is a common parenting mistake that hinders your child's ability to develop emotional intelligence, says Raouda, an author and certified conscious parenting coach.\"Stop focusing on their behavior and start focusing on their [well-being],\" she says. \"Children are not robots, and their emotions are being completely ignored, dismissed [or even] punished.\"Experts often link emotional intelligence to success, because it helps people manage the kinds of negative emotions that could otherwise lead to burnout, anxiety or depression, research shows.\"Your emotional well-being is your success,\" says Raouda, adding that parents who ignore their kids' emotional development are less likely to raise happy, successful adults. \"Who cares about how much money you have, if you are anxiety-ridden, depressed, [and] don't know who you are?\"DON'T MISS: The ultimate guide to teaching your kids about moneyParents do need to enforce boundaries, Raouda says, particularly when a child's outburst involves mistreating other people. They also need to remind kids that their feelings — positive or negative — are normal, and that it's healthy to express them constructively, she says.Focus on \"not making them feel bad for their anger [and] not telling them to cheer up when they're sad,\" says Raouda. \"Letting them be in their feelings is No. 1.\"You might, for example, ask your child what they were feeling that led them to act out, break a rule or otherwise cross a previously established boundary. Helping your kids name their emotions is the first step toward them developing the ability to manage those emotions, Raouda says.Some other experts agree: Children who feel heard and not shamed for their feelings typically become more open to avoiding negative behaviors, according to psychologist Caroline Fleck. \"The point is to validate the emotion and then focus on what's not valid, which is the behavior [and that's] what needs to change,\" Fleck told CNBC Make It in January.Parents who overemphasize obedience, which can require the suppression of big feelings, run the risk of raising people-pleasers who can't advocate for themselves and are more likely to grow into anxious, unhappy adults, Raouda says.A mother herself, Raouda says she'd practice emotion-naming exercises with her son even when he was too young to articulate how he was feeling on his own. That involved asking if he was angry or frustrated and, if so, having him rank the severity of his feelings on a scale of 1 to 10, she says.And when parents feel emotional themselves, they can tell their children directly: I'm upset, or I'm sad. The idea is to show your children that you don't have to suppress those negative feelings, says Raouda.\"Naming it takes away from the [negative] stigma,\" she says. \"It's just, like, 'Yeah, I was angry, I was embarrassed, I was sad, I was nervous' … Feelings are normal and healthy and fine.\"Want to give your kids the ultimate advantage?

    "body": "Bob Newhart and Will Ferrell star in \"Elf.\"Warner Bros.In the 2003 movie \"Elf,\" the lead character Buddy discovers he is human, though he has spent his life raised by elves.He travels to New York City to find his real family, including his father who shares an Upper West Side apartment with his family.The fictitious apartment, located at 55 Central Park West, is home to Buddy's father, Walter; his wife, Emily; and their son, Michael. Based on the story, it is likely the apartment has at least two bedrooms, according to Cody Garrett, a certified financial planner at Measure Twice Financial in Houston.Today, a two-bedroom apartment at that location would cost around $2 million, Garrett estimates, with a mortgage payment of around $10,000 per month before taxes, insurance and maintenance.Read more CNBC personal finance coverageTrump promises 'largest tax refund season of all time.'

The median asking rent for a two-bedroom, two-bathroom apartment in that same ZIP code is $9,175 per month as of November and $8,400 per month more broadly on the Upper West Side, according to StreetEasy, a New York City real estate search website owned by Zillow.Meanwhile, the median asking price for a two-bedroom, two-bathroom apartment is around $2.5 million as of November and almost $2.2 million on the Upper West Side, according to StreetEasy data. To rent or buy? New York City Madison Square park view with Christmas lights and Manhattan skyscrapers.Getty ImagesThe question \"Should I buy or should I rent?\" is increasingly relevant today.Renting is cheaper than paying a mortgage in all 50 of the largest U.S. metropolitan areas, according to an April Bankrate study. That cost difference has grown in 38 metro areas in the past year, Bankrate's research found. Yet, New York does not top the list for the biggest difference between renting and buying. Instead, cities including San Francisco; San Jose, California; Seattle; Denver; and Salt Lake City are in the top five. There are reasons why buying can be more financially challenging. Rising home prices have outpaced rent increases in many markets, while mortgage rates have also climbed. Housing supply can also be an issue, with not enough homes available for aspiring purchasers.Emotions may also factor into the buying vs. renting trade-off. For some, buying can offer a sense of security. Others may prefer the reduced responsibility for upkeep that renting provides.\"I actually consider a primary residence to be a lifestyle decision, not an investment,\" Garrett said.To help clients gauge housing affordability, Garrett said he refers to the 28/36 rule. That means no more than 28% of gross monthly income should go to housing costs, and total debt including housing should be no more than 36% of monthly gross income. Monthly homeownership costs are typically measured by PITI — the sum of mortgage principal, interest, taxes and insurance.The fictitious couple Walter and Emily Hobbs in the \"Elf\" movie would need gross income exceeding $450,000 to justify buying the property, according to Garrett. Walter is an executive at a children's book publisher, while Emily also has an unspecified high-level job. Even if they meet that income threshold for home ownership, they may still be squeezed by saving and planning for retirement, Garrett said. Moreover, their son Michael attends York Preparatory school, where annual tuition and fees currently run around nearly $68,000 for grades six through 12.Garrett recently worked with a client who purchased a home in the same neighborhood for around $15,000 per month. Ahead of the purchase, Garrett cautioned the client about how the high home costs could require sacrifice in other aspects of life, including pushing their targeted retirement date later.The \"Elf\" movie has other lessons when it comes to cost of living, particularly for the character Jovie, who works at Gimbels department store and lives in Chinatown.Because it appears she is living paycheck to paycheck, she likely isn't saving for retirement or emergencies, Garrett said, which is common among people who move to New York in search of success. As Leon the snowman tells Buddy when he leaves the North Pole for New York, \"This might be the golden opportunity to find out who you really are.\"Those who move to New York or other big metro areas with similar aspirations may take steps to try to defray the high cost of living, Garrett said. For example, to ease her financial situation, Jovie may find roommates or additional streams of income, he said. ",

    "body": "(This is the Warren Buffett Watch newsletter, news and analysis on all things Warren Buffett and Berkshire Hathaway. You can sign up here to receive it every Friday evening in your inbox.)With Warren Buffett's planned departure as Berkshire Hathaway's CEO less than two weeks away, some on Wall Street have advice for incoming CEO Greg Abel.Glenview Trust CIO Bill Stone says the most important thing Abel can do is \"don't try to be Warren Buffett.\"Buffett and Charlie Munger, he said on Yahoo Finance, were the \"greatest duo\" in investing of all time. \"Trying to beat them at their game, so to speak, is probably not the right thing.\"Stone thinks Abel should concentrate on increasing operating earnings, reducing the number of outstanding shares, and being ready to seize opportunities when they arise.Gregory Abel, Vice Chairman overseeing non-insurance operations for Berkshire Hathaway, meets shareholders in the exhibition hall during the Berkshire Hathaway Inc annual shareholders' meeting in Omaha, Nebraska, U.S., May 3, 2024. Scott Morgan | ReutersOn Yahoo Finance's \"Market Dominion,\" Boyar Research President Jonathan Boyar told CNBC alum Josh Lipton the best thing Abel could do to win Wall Street's trust is to \"buy an extremely large amount of Berkshire stock personally and really put his money where his mouth is.\"According to the 2025 annual meeting proxy, Abel already owns what Boyar calls a \"fair amount\" of Berkshire shares that are currently valued at around $171 million, but he notes that \"all of that was bought when, obviously, Buffett\" ran the company.Boyar expects Abel will impose a lot more management oversight than Buffett, who famously took a hands-off approach to the subsidiaries.As a result of that decentralization, Boyar says, \"There's probably a lot of fat to cut. There're probably divisions that can be consolidated. There are many things they could do to enhance profitability that Buffett just hasn't wanted to do.\"Buffett is the greatest capital allocator and the greatest investor of all time. He's not known as the best manager of all time. Greg Abel might be able to do things that he couldn't or wouldn't do.\"After Buffett announced at the May annual meeting that he planned to step down as CEO at the end of the year, Berkshire's B shares fell 15% over three months.They have cut that drop to 8.4% as of Friday's close.Is Berkshire a buy going into the Greg Abel era?The Motley Fool's David Jagielski writes Buffett's long tenure gave the company \"plenty of time to prepare for a successor\" and Abel is \"well prepared\" to be CEO.He predicts Abel's approach\" won't differ a lot\" from Buffett's but there could still be significant changes in Berkshire's portfolio. The addition of a stake in the big tech stock Alphabet in the third quarter may have given investors a \"glimpse\" of the future.He's also \"cautiously optimistic\" Berkshire may put more emphasis on growth stocks and \"pivot away from slow-growing investments like Kraft Heinz.\"Jagielski expects Berkshire to be an \"excellent buy\" for next year and longer. \"If it dips in value after Buffett leaves, that would simply make it an even more attractive investment to buy.\"Mel Casey at FBB Capital Partners tells Yahoo Finance the diversity of Berkshire's subsidiaries gives it an \"all-weather quality\" so that \"you could almost think of it as a lower-risk alternative to owning the broader market.\"He sees Berkshire as \"pretty reasonably valued\" in a \"year of pretty high valuations for U.S. large cap stocks.\"On the bearish side, Casey warns there is a risk of losing the \"Buffett premium.\"\"There's definitely a caution out there that some of the core investors are investors in Buffett rather than in the actual fundamentals of the company itself.\"Berkshire's BNSF: Big rail merger is 'significant threat' to consumersA GE AC4400CW diesel-electric locomotive in Union Pacific livery is seen near Union Station in Los Angeles on Sept. 15, 2022.Bing Guan | ReutersUNP CEO Jim Vena is quoted by Reuters as saying he is confident the deal will be approved. \"If we stand still, we are going to get left behind. I'm not into that. The benefits of this transaction are undeniable.\"Buffett told CNBC last August that Berkshire would not try to counter a possible UP-NSC combination by merging BNSF with CSX, but the two railroads did announce what they called \"a collaboration\" to provide \"seamless, efficient, coast-to-coast solutions to ship between the western and eastern U.S.\"BNSF's routes are in the western U.S. while CSX operates in the east.BUFFETT AROUND THE INTERNETSome links may require a subscription:CNBC Pro (subscription): Todd Combs' stellar 15-year career at Berkshire started with an unsolicited letter to Charlie MungerNebraska Public Media: The 'Oracle of Omaha' wraps up his last year as Berkshire CEOThe Atlantic (subscription): How Warren Buffett Did ItReuters: Warren Buffett's successor Greg Abel had steady rise at BerkshireMarketWatch on MSN: These are the secrets to Buffett's investment success, according to this billionaire investorReuters: How the US freight rail industry got dirtier than coal power plantsBusiness Insurance: Ackman 'taking a page' from Buffett with Vantage acquisitionHIGHLIGHTS FROM THE ARCHIVECan Berkshire's culture endure for decades? (2016)Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger explain why they're confident Berkshire's culture will last even after Buffett's son Howard no longer serves as non-executive chairman.watch nowAUDIENCE MEMBER: You have said before that your role will be divided into parts for your succession, one of which will be the responsibility of maintaining culture by having [son] Howard [Buffett] as non-executive chairman.What is the plan for how Berkshire will maintain its culture when Howard no longer fills the role, and what should shareholders watch for to make sure that the culture is being properly maintained decades from now when I am your age?...WARREN BUFFETT: By far, the main factor in keeping Berkshire's culture is that you have a board and you'll have successor board members. You have managers and you'll have successor managers. And you have shareholders that clearly recognize the special nature of the culture, that have embraced the culture. When they sold their businesses to us, they wanted to join that culture.It's a — it thrusts out people that really aren't in tune with it, and there are very few of them. And it embraces those who enjoy and appreciate it. And I think, to some extent, we don't have a lot of competition on it. So it becomes very identifiable, and it works...CHARLIE MUNGER: I really think the culture is going to surprise everybody — how well it lasts — and how well they do. They're going to wonder why they ever made any fuss over us in the first place. It's going to work very well.WARREN BUFFETT: We've got so many good ingredients in place, just in terms of the businesses and people already here, you know, that — at the companies.CHARLIE MUNGER: That's what I'm saying.WARREN BUFFETT: Yeah.CHARLIE MUNGER: There's just so much power in place.BERKSHIRE STOCK WATCHFour weeksTwelve monthsBRK.A stock price: $745,600.00BRK.B stock price: $494.53BRK.B P/E (TTM): 15.81Berkshire market capitalization: $1,068,856,999,340Berkshire Cash as of September 30: $381.7 billion (Up 10.9% from June 30)Excluding Rail Cash and Subtracting T-Bills Payable: $354.3 billion (Up 4.3% from June 30)No Berkshire stock repurchases since May 2024.(All figures are as of the date of publication, unless otherwise indicated)BERKSHIRE'S TOP EQUITY HOLDINGS - Dec. 19, 2025Berkshire's top holdings of disclosed publicly traded stocks in the U.S. and Japan, by market value, based on the latest closing prices.Holdings are as of September 30, 2025, as reported in Berkshire Hathaway's 13F filing on November 14, 2025, except for:Mitsubishi, which is as of August 28, 2025Mitsui, which is as of September 30, 2025The full list of holdings and current market values is available from CNBC.com's Berkshire Hathaway Portfolio Tracker.QUESTIONS OR COMMENTSPlease send any questions or comments about the newsletter to me at alex.crippen@cnbc.com.

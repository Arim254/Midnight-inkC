    "body": "The Grok AI logo is seen displayed on a smartphone with the Wikipedia logo in the background. Sopa Images | Lightrocket | Getty ImagesElon Musk launched an early version of an AI-powered encyclopedia called 'Grokipedia' on Monday, with its website temporarily crashing before coming back online hours later. The new AI service, named after xAI's large language model Grok, has been promoted by Musk as an improved and less biased version of the popular free and web-based Wikipedia. The Tesla and SpaceX CEO announced last month that he was working on a Wikipedia rival after a suggestion from David Sacks, a fellow tech mogul who is serving as U.S. President Donald Trump administration's AI and crypto czar.Musk, who has endorsed Germany's far-right extremist party AfD, has previously lambasted Wikipedia as \"woke\" and criticized it for citing news outlets such as The New York Times and NPR as sources in many of its articles.In a post on X, Musk said that the launch was only \"Grokipedia version 0.1,\" but that a later \"version 1.0 will be 10X better.\" However, he argued the current version was better than Wikipedia. Reports and copies of the site on the web archive, The Way Back Machine, indicate the site was down for a few hours. The Grokipedia.com page features a search bar on a dark background and says it has logged 885,279 articles, which appear to be in a style reminiscent of Wikipedia.For comparison, the Wikipedia website said it had over 7 million articles on its English Wikipedia as of Tuesday. Wikipedia's articles are also written and edited by a community of volunteer writers and editors, while Grokipedia appears to be solely generated by AI. Musk's 'anti-woke' AI crusade continues Grokipedia represents the latest application of xAI's chatbots into Musk's projects after Grok was integrated into the X social media platform. Musk has also advertised Grok as an \"anti-woke\" and unbiased alternative to competitors like OpenAI's ChatGPT. However, as noted by many media outlets and X users, both the Grok chatbot and Grokipedia itself commonly cite Wikipedia as a source when queried by users. In a statement shared with CNBC, a Wikimedia Foundation spokesperson said the company was \"still in the process of understanding how Grokipedia works,\" but added that alternative versions of Wikipedia have appeared before and haven't interfered with its work or mission.When asked about accusations of bias, the spokesperson said that Wikipedia is written to inform billions of readers without promoting a particular point of view, adding that \"unlike newer projects, Wikipedia's strengths are clear: it has transparent policies, rigorous volunteer oversight, and a strong culture of continuous improvement.\"\"Wikipedia's knowledge is — and always will be — human. Through open collaboration and consensus, people from all backgrounds build a neutral, living record of human understanding — one that reflects our diversity and collective curiosity. This human-created knowledge is what AI companies rely on to generate content; even Grokipedia needs Wikipedia to exist,\" it added.Wikipedia co-founder Jimmy Wales reportedly told the Washington Post last week that he didn't have high expectations for Grokipedia as AI language models weren't sophisticated enough and \"there will be a lot of errors.\"On the other hand, Larry Sanger — a Wikipedia co-founder that resigned as editor and chief in 2002 and has long criticized its current editorial leaderships — has previously shown enthusiasm about a new to Wikipedia. However, following the launch of Grokipedia- Sanger posted a long thread pointing out what he called inaccuracies on the AI encyclopedia for himself.",

    "body": "A cargo ship is loading and unloading foreign trade containers at Qingdao Port in Qingdao City, Shandong Province, China on July 28, 2025.CFOTO | Future Publishing | Getty ImagesGlobal trade is not broken, despite the disruption, pressure and shock of trade tariffs introduced by the U.S. this year, the head of the World Trade Organization (WTO) told CNBC Tuesday.\"Many people have the impression that, because of the unilateral actions of the U.S., that global trade is broken. Yes [they've] been a great disruption — the greatest disruption of global trade in 80 years — but we are pleased to see the resilience of the system,\" WTO Director-General Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala said.\"The system is battered, it's bruised, but it's still standing,\" she told CNBC's Dan Murphy on the sidelines of the Future Investment Initiative in Saudi Arabia.Okonjo-Iweala's comments come as U.S. President Donald Trump, the architect of multiple U.S. tariffs on foreign imports to the States, continues a tour of Asia in which he has signed trade deals and truces, so far.But the big prize for Trump will be whether he and Chinese President Xi Jinping, who are due to meet Thursday, can come to a deal to reduce duties and counter-tariffs on a range of each other's goods. Trump said Monday that Washington and Beijing were poised to \"come away with\" a trade deal, raising market hopes.watch now\"We do wish that the meeting goes very well,\" Okonjo-Iweala said, noting that any de-escalation in trade tensions would be welcome.\"Any threat of disconnect and conflict between China and the U.S. in trade is not good for either country or for the world. Any threat of fragmentation or division between the two, into two global trading camps, will lead to losses in global welfare, and the poorer countries will be harder hit,\" she said.WTO forecast Earlier in October, the WTO hiked its forecast for global trade growth in 2025, but warned the outlook for 2026 had deteriorated.Despite predicting that trade volume growth would stand at 2.4% this year, up sharply from a previous estimate of 0.9% in the trade body's August report, the WTO slashed its previous expectation of 1.8% trade volume growth next year to a lackluster 0.5%.It cited a cooling global economy and the impact of higher tariffs as a reason for the revision.Trade tariffs have become a dominant feature, and headwind, for global commerce since U.S. President Donald Trump shocked friends and foes alike with his widescale tariffs regime in April.Countries scrambled to reach trade deals with the White House but even allies, such as the U.K., have seen a baseline 10% tariff remain on goods exported to the U.S.Global trade volumes rose sharply in the first half of 2025 — up 4.9% year on year — with several factors contributing to the robust expansion.These included the front-loading of imports into the U.S. in anticipation of higher trade tariffs, and favorable macroeconomic conditions with disinflation, supportive fiscal policies and tight labor markets boosting real incomes and spending in major economies, the WTO said.Strong growth in emerging markets and increased demand for artificial intelligence-related goods — including semiconductors, servers and telecommunications equipment — also fueled global trade growth, it added, with AI-related spending driving nearly half of the overall trade expansion in the first half of the year, rising 20% year on year in value terms.Global competition when it comes to developing AI-related products has heated up.The WTO noted that the U.S. accounted for roughly one-fifth of global AI-related trade growth in the first half of 2025. The bulk of the expansion came from Asia, however, which accounted for nearly two-thirds of global AI-related trade growth in the same time period.",

Today's number is the four-week average ending Oct. 11.\"ADP's near real-time employment data, released weekly, will now provide an even clearer picture of the labor market at this critical time for the economy...providing a dynamic view of job creation and loss at an unprecedented level of weekly detail,\" said Nela Richardson, chief economist at ADP.This preliminary data will be different from the better-known and closely followed National Employment Report, generally released on the Wednesday before the government's payroll number. The NER measures the monthly change in job growth during the week that contains the 12th of the month and provides detail of job growth by sector. The preliminary data, which can serve as a guide to the monthly data, offers a four-week moving average of weekly job growth. It will be revised monthly with the release of the NER.The 14,250 increase suggests monthly job growth totaled around 55,000 for the 4-week period, compared with a loss of -32,000 reported for September in the NER. However the total is subject to revision with the release of the NER.",

Kevin Lamarque | ReutersTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Monday confirmed that the list of candidates to replace Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has been winnowed down to five, and President Donald Trump said the replacement is likely to be named by the end of the year.Speaking to reporters on Air Force One, Bessent said the finalists are current Fed Governors Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman, National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett, former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh, and BlackRock executive Rick Rieder, according to several media outlets.Those names were reported earlier this month by CNBC.Bessent, who had been rumored to be a top candidate as well, said he has been conducting interviews and that he expects to do one more round before presenting a \"good slate\" to Trump after the Thanksgiving holiday.Trump, also speaking to reporters Monday on Air Force One, said he anticipates naming a replacement by the end of the year. Powell's term doesn't expire until May. Powell then can either step down from the Fed entirely or continue serving a term as governor that lasts until 2028.The Federal Open Market Committee meets this week, with an interest rate decision due Wednesday. Markets are pricing in a near certainty that the committee will lower its benchmark overnight borrowing rate by a quarter percentage point, which would follow a similar cut in September.Trump has three appointees on the seven-member board of governors: Waller and Bowman, as well as Stephen Miran, who is filling an unexpired term that ends in January. Miran, who was confirmed in September as the head of the Council of Economic Advisers, is not expected to be reappointed. He has campaigned for the FOMC to be more aggressive in easing.Should Powell opt to leave the Fed, that would give Trump four appointees. Trump thus far has been unsuccessful in trying to remove Governor Lisa Cook from the board. A rotating cast of five regional presidents joins the governors as voters during the FOMC meeting.",

Hamad I Mohammed | ReutersThink of Saudi Arabia and the first thing that comes to mind might be its massive, oil-derived wealth.While oil continues to drive Saudi Arabia's economy, the kingdom is now expanding into areas such as artificial intelligence, tourism and sports to diversify its growth avenues.According to Saudi Arabia's Minister for Investment Khalid Al Falih, more than half — 50.6% — of the Saudi economy is now \"completely decoupled\" from oil.\"This percentage is growing,\" Al Falih told CNBC's Dan Murphy, adding that government revenue used to be almost completely derived from oil money, but now, 40% of its revenue comes from sectors and sources that \"have nothing to do with oil.\"\"We're seeing great results, but we're not satisfied. We want to do more. We want to accelerate the kingdom's diversification and growth story,\" he said.Saudi Arabia is doubling down on fast-growing sectors such as artificial intelligence, naming it one of its new growth areas, with Al Falih saying the kingdom will be a \"key investor\" in developing AI applications and large language models. Saudi Arabia would also build data centers \"at a scale and at a competitive cost not achieved anywhere else.\"\"AI has emerged [in] the last three, four years, and it's definitely going to define how the future economy of every nation. Those who invest will lead, and those who lag behind, unfortunately, will lose,\" he pointed out.On Monday, AI chip company Groq's CEO, Jonathan Ross, told CNBC that  for AI infrastructure thanks to its energy surplus. The country could see more than $135 billion in gains by 2030 thanks to AI, according to PwC.Saudi Arabia's quarterly budget performance report revealed that total government revenue for the first half of 2025 came in at 565.21 billion Saudi riyals ($150.73 billion), with oil making up 53.4% of the country's overall revenue, down from 67.97% in the same period in 2019.In 2024, the country reported a 1.3% rise in full-year GDP, mainly driven by a 4.3% increase in non-oil segments. Oil activity, on the other hand, fell 4.5% year on year.The country's sovereign wealth fund — the Public Investment Fund — has acquired stakes in tech giants, video game publishers and football clubs as it uses oil revenues to diversify into other sectors.PIF has acquired stakes in video-game heavyweight Electronic Arts, establishing the SoftBank Vision Fund with Masayoshi Son's SoftBank Group Corp in 2017, and a takeover of English Premier League club Newcastle United in 2021.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconWhen asked if declining oil prices were piling pressure on Saudi Arabia's economy and government revenue, Al Falih said that the country was not scaling back budgets and there were no cuts to public spending.Oil prices have fallen in 2025, with Brent crude spot prices down 13.4% so far this year, according to FactSet. Saudi Arabia's oil revenue slid 24% in the first half of 2025 from a year earlier.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconThe government will continue to address all activities that require government spending, Al Falih said, noting that the PIF has grown sixfold since its creation and that the country was approaching nearly $1 trillion in capital deployed across sectors of strategic interest.Tourism has also been a key growth area for Saudi Arabia. Ahmed Al-Khateeb, the country's tourism minister, told CNBC that the sector's share in GDP had grown to 5% in 2024 from 3% in 2019.\"We are [opening] resorts, new airlines, new airports, and the numbers are growing, and we are focusing on countries and visitors that are coming from outside to experience our great culture,\" Al-Khateeb highlighted.The tourism minister also expressed confidence that the sector could contribute 10% of GDP by 2030, aiming to raise it to 20% eventually.\"This 20% will help Saudi Arabia to diversify the economy and make it more sustainable,\" he added.",

    "body": "Sopa Images | Lightrocket | Getty ImagesPayPal has signed a deal with OpenAI to have its digital wallet embedded into ChatGPT so users can pay for items found through the leading consumer AI tool, the company told CNBC exclusively.Shares of the company jumped as much as 14% in premarket trading on the news.The agreement, sealed over the weekend, means that starting next year, both sides of PayPal's ecosystem can plug into ChatGPT: PayPal users can purchase items through the AI platform, and its merchants can sell on it, with their inventory listed there, according to PayPal CEO Alex Chriss.\"We've got hundreds of millions of loyal PayPal wallet holders who now will be able to click the 'Buy with PayPal button' on ChatGPT and have a safe and secure checkout experience,\" Chriss said in an interview.The move makes PayPal an early part of OpenAI's efforts to broaden ChatGPT's use for e-commerce. The thinking is that its 700 million-plus weekly users can lean on artificial intelligence to help them find items, similar to a human personal shopper. Last month, OpenAI said its users could buy from Shopify and Etsy merchants, and two weeks ago it announced an e-commerce deal with Walmart.\"It's a whole new paradigm for shopping,\" Chriss said. \"It's hard to imagine that agentic commerce isn't going to be a big part of the future.\"PayPal is attempting to position itself as a payments backbone for the coming era of agentic AI shopping, announcing recent deals with Google and artificial intelligence firm Perplexity. The fintech firm, which also released third-quarter results Tuesday, issued a release on its OpenAI deal after CNBC's report.The company will also manage merchant routing, payment validation and other behind-the-scenes aspects of payment processing for PayPal sellers on ChatGPT, so individual merchants don't have to sign up with OpenAI, the firm said.Chriss touted the fact that both consumers and merchants have been verified by the fintech firm, reducing the risk of fraud for either group. Users can pull funds from linked bank accounts or credit cards, or stored balances, to pay for purchases, and they'll get protections, package tracking and dispute resolution.\"It's not just that a transaction can happen,\" Chriss said. \"It's that this is a trusted set of merchants, the largest merchant network in the world from PayPal, that are verified, with the largest set of verified consumers in a consumer wallet.\"PayPal also said it is expanding the use of OpenAI's enterprise AI products for its employees to speed up product cycles.",

    "body": "A UPS worker pushes a cart in New York, US, on Monday, Oct. 27, 2025.Michael Nagle | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesUnited Parcel Service on Tuesday reported earnings that topped Wall Street's estimates ahead of its busy holiday season.Shares of the package delivery giant surged 10% in premarket trading.Here's how the company performed in its third quarter, compared with what Wall Street was expecting based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:Earnings per share: $1.74 adjusted vs. $1.30 expectedRevenue: $21.4 billion vs. $20.83 billion expectedFor the period ended Sept. 30, the company reported net income of $1.31 billion, or $1.55 per share, compared with $1.99 billion, or $1.80 per share, the year prior. Adjusting for one-time items, including costs of its transformation strategy, the company reported profit of $1.48 billion or $1.74 per share.UPS estimates its fourth quarter revenue to be $24 billion with an operating margin of 11% to 11.5%.The company also on Tuesday laid out details of its previously announced turnaround plan and said it cut its workforce by 34,000 jobs, greater than its previous estimate of 20,000, as part of its plan to trim down its work with Amazon, previously its largest customer.UPS also initiated a sale-leaseback transaction in the third quarter for five properties as part of its broader strategy, which resulted in a $330 million pre-tax gain on sale in its supply chain solutions division. It said Tuesday that it has now closed daily operations at 93 leased and owned buildings through September as part of the initiative.UPS said its turnaround plan has resulted in $2.2 billion in savings through the end of the third quarter, with an estimate of achieving $3.5 billion total year-over-year cost savings in 2025.\"We are executing the most significant strategic shift in our company's history, and the changes we are implementing are designed to deliver long-term value for all stakeholders,\" CEO Carol Tomé said. \"With the holiday shipping season nearly upon us, we are positioned to run the most efficient peak in our history while providing industry-leading service to our customers for the eighth consecutive year.\"The courier's strong results come as the parcel industry faces a volatile tariff environment and sluggish demand, in addition to impacts from the end of the de minimis loophole. Rival FedEx said last month that it incurred $150 million in headwinds from the global trade environment.",

    "body": "watch nowOnline home goods company Wayfair reported a jump in third-quarter revenue on Tuesday, as it beat Wall Street estimates on the top and bottom lines.The company said total net revenue increased 8.1% year-over-year.Here's how the company performed in its third quarter, compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:Earnings per share: 70 cents adjusted vs. 43 cents expectedRevenue: $3.12 billion vs. $3.02 billion expectedWayfair shares climbed 10% in premarket trading.For the period ended Sept. 30, Wayfair reported a net loss of $99 million, or 76 cents per share, compared to a loss of $74 million, or 60 cents per share, the year prior.The company's U.S. revenue rose 8.6% year over year to $2.7 billion, while international revenue climbed 4.6% year over year to $389 million. Wayfair said its total net revenue excluding its Germany exit jumped 9% year over year.The revenue increase comes as the overall home goods sector has seen recent struggles, partly due to rising inflation and lower home turnover during a stretch of high interest rates. The sector has also faced challenges in President Donald Trump's furniture tariffs, in addition to other duties — though rates on imported goods from many countries are now lower than Trump proposed earlier this year.CFO Kate Gulliver told CNBC that the company doesn't credit the growth to any macro-related factors like tariffs or interest rates.\"We think it's really being driven by our share gain, and that, we believe is really coming from a confluence of factors and initiatives that we started over a year ago that are now starting to bear fruit,\" Gulliver said.Those initiatives include what Gulliver calls the company's \"core recipe\" – price, product availability and speed – in addition to growth from its loyalty program, site improvement and physical retail. The retailer opened its first large store in Illinois last year to ride the wave of physical stores' comeback. Based on that success, it plans to open another location in Yonkers, New York, in early 2027.Though tariff policy has created uncertainty for the company, she said it has been able to lean on the strength of its model: operating as a marketplace on the back end and as a retailer on the front end.Wayfair saw a post-pandemic slump in sales in what was a \"somewhat challenged\" time for the home goods category, Gulliver said, but the past year has brought increased momentum. Despite tariff volatility, Wayfair's stock had gained roughly 95% this year as of Monday's close.CEO Niraj Shah added in the earnings release that the company's delivered orders for the quarter grew 5% year-over-year.\"Our 6.7% Adjusted EBITDA margin marks the highest level achieved in Wayfair's history outside of the pandemic period,\" Shah said in the release. \"As we've promised, substantial profitability flow through is powered by a strong contribution margin and fixed cost discipline as our business has returned to growth.\"Wayfair said its active customers totaled 21.2 million at the end of the quarter, a 2.3% decrease year over year.",

    "body": "Guests enjoy the Fortune Global Forum 2025 Gala Dinner on October 26, 2025 at Diriyah Gate, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.Cedric Ribeiro | Getty Images Entertainment | Getty ImagesMining executives have welcomed a sharp upswing in investor interest from the Middle East, as Gulf states seek to expand their critical mineral ambitions and take on established global players.Critical minerals refer to a subset of materials considered essential to the energy transition. These resources, which tend to have a high risk of supply chain disruption, include metals such as copper, lithium, nickel, cobalt and rare earth elements.\"The interest in rare earths in this part of the world is phenomenal,\" Tony Sage, CEO of U.S.-listed rare earths miner Critical Metals, said during a business trip through the Middle East.\"I didn't expect it because, you know, they can't mine it. There [are] really no discoveries in this area, but they want to be able to participate somehow in the downstream,\" Sage told CNBC by telephone.His comments come as policymakers and business leaders flock to Saudi Arabia's Future Investment Initiative (FII) in Riyadh, an event nicknamed as the \"Davos in the Desert.\"The annual event, which got underway on Monday, is being held under the theme: \"The Key to Prosperity: Unlocking New Frontiers of Growth.\" It is expected this year's FII will lean into areas such as artificial intelligence, particularly as the oil-rich kingdom continues with its mission to diversify its economy.A wheel loader takes ore to a crusher at the MP Materials rare earth mine in Mountain Pass, California, U.S. January 30, 2020.Steve Marcus | ReutersAnalysts say Gulf states, led by the likes of Saudi Arabia and the UAE, are increasingly seeking to leverage their financial capital and geographic location to capture critical minerals market share.A series of targeted acquisitions and international partnerships forms a key part of this regional strategy, according to an analysis by the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS), with Gulf states seeking to present themselves as alternative partners to Western nations.Critical Metals, for its part, has partnered with Saudi Arabia's Obeikan Group to build a large-scale lithium hydroxide processing plant in the kingdom.A strategic pushKevin Das, senior technical consultant at New Frontier Minerals, an Australian-based rare earths explorer, linked investor interest in rare earths from the Middle East to exponential growth in the field of AI.\"It's no surprise that you're seeing interest, not just in the Western world, but spreading into the Gulf States because I think people are realizing that we're probably on the cusp of an AI boom,\" Das told CNBC by telephone.\"If you start to see the emergence of robotics, every robot is going to need these rare earths. And I think the supply is only going to get tighter,\" he added.Read moreRare earth elements have emerged as a key bargaining chip in the ongoing U.S.-China trade war, although global stocks rallied on Monday amid investor hopes of thawing tensions between the world's two largest economies.U.S. officials have touted the prospect of China delaying strict rare earth export controls as part of a high-stakes summit between President Donald Trump and China's Xi Jinping on Thursday.Rare earths refer to 17 elements on the periodic table whose atomic structure gives them special magnetic properties. These elements are widely used in the automotive, robotics and defense sectors.U.S. President Donald Trump meets with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman during a “coffee ceremony” at the Saudi Royal Court on May 13, 2025, in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.Win Mcnamee | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesShaun Bunn, managing director at London-listed Empire Metals, said his company had also received considerable investor interest from the Middle East.\"I think that it is very much part of the kingdom's strategic push to diversify away from its oil. I mean, they are always going to make the most money out of oil at the moment at least, but they are trying to diversify,\" Bunn told CNBC by telephone.Critical mineral ambitionsAnalysts have flagged a number of barriers facing the Gulf states' push for critical minerals, however, noting that regional players remain marginal producers at present.\"Many of Saudi Arabia's mining ventures remain in early or even conceptual stages, and the country still depends on foreign partners for expertise, such that it may take years for Saudi Arabia, and the Gulf states more generally, to scale up enough to dent Chinese dominance or to fully meet Western demand,\" Asna Wajid, research analyst at IISS, said in an analysis published in late July.\"Many in the West, moreover, may be wary of replacing their dependence on China with dependence on the Gulf states, which already exercise considerable strategic leverage due to their oil and gas supplies,\" Wajid said.China is the undisputed leader of the critical minerals supply chain, producing roughly 70% of the world's supply of rare earths and processing almost 90%, which means it is importing these materials from other countries and processing them.U.S. officials have previously warned that this dominance poses a strategic challenge amid the pivot to more sustainable energy sources.",

Nathan Posner | Anadolu | Getty ImagesThe largest union representing federal workers on Monday called for Democrats in Congress to end the ongoing government shutdown by voting for the stopgap funding measure that Republicans have proposed.\"It's time to pass a clean continuing resolution and end this shutdown today,\" Everett Kelley, president of the American Federation of Government Employees, wrote.\"No half measures, and no gamesmanship. Put every single federal worker back on the job with full back pay — today,\" said Kelley, whose union represents more than 800,000 federal and District of Columbia government workers.\"Because when the folks who serve this country are standing in line for food banks after missing a second paycheck because of this shutdown, they aren't looking for partisan spin,\" Kelley said. \"They're looking for the wages they earned. The fact that they're being cheated out of it is a national disgrace.\"The shutdown began on Oct. 1, and has led to about 900,000 federal workers being furloughed.Senate Democrats have largely resisted voting for the clean resolution, which would fund the government through Nov. 21, saying they want any funding measure to extend enhanced Affordable Care Act tax credits.Those subsidies, which are due to expire at the end of 2025, lower the cost of Obamacare health insurance plans for more than 20 million Americans.Republicans, in turn, say the fate of ACA tax credits should be addressed only after a funding resolution is passed.At least 60 senators need to vote for such a measure because of the Senate's filibuster rules. Republicans only hold 53 seats in that chamber.In his statement, Kelley did not explicitly address the question of the ACA subsidies, but he seemed to refer to it, writing, \"Reopen the government immediately under a clean continuing resolution that allows continued debate on larger issues.\"\"Both political parties have made their point, and still there is no clear end in sight,\" Kelley wrote. \"Unfortunately, shutdowns have become a recurring tactic in Washington.\"\"But there is no 'winning' a government shutdown. They cost taxpayers billions, hurt small businesses, and erode confidence in government itself,\" he said.",

The sprawling data centers will push the boundaries of what is possible in the U.S. during a time when the electric grid is already under strain.\"Electricity is not simply a utility,\" OpenAI said in a blog post Tuesday. \"It's a strategic asset that is critical to building the AI infrastructure that will secure our leadership on the most consequential technology since electricity itself.\"Read more CNBC tech newsOpenAI's spending bonanza has Wall Street focused on capex in Big Tech earnings reportsAI spending is boosting the economy, but many businesses are in survival modeApple begins shipping American-made AI servers from TexasEU says TikTok and Meta broke transparency rules under landmark tech lawOpenAI shared an 11-page submission with the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, in which it encouraged the U.S. to commit to building 100 gigawatts of new energy capacity each year.A gigawatt is a measure of power, and 10 gigawatts is roughly equivalent to the annual power consumption of 8 million U.S. households, according to a CNBC analysis of data from the Energy Information Administration.OpenAI said that China added 429 gigawatts of new power capacity last year, while the U.S. added 51 gigawatts.

Gabriel Monnet | Afp | Getty ImagesNovartis \"can never be done\" when it comes to major acquisitions in its sector as it always needs to look for the next \"great asset,\" CEO Vas Narasimhan told CNBC.In order to offset the hit from generics competition Novartis has been on a buying spree, acquiring more than 35 companies over the last year. The Swiss drugmaker announced its biggest deal in a decade on Sunday, when it announced it has agreed to buy U.S. biotechnology company Avidity Biosciences for about $12 billion. The purchase will give the Basel, Switzerland-based pharma giant access to Avidity's vast pipeline of promising experimental drugs. Novartis said two of Avidity's three leading drugs that are expected to be launched before 2030 have the potential to generate billions of dollars in sales.\"We are driven by science and the technology, in this case this was a perfect fit for us … If you take a look at our free cash flow it approaching $20 billion a year, so we have adequate firepower to do deals like this and to bolster the growth profile of the company,\" Narasimhan told CNBC's \"Europe Early Edition.\" watch nowNovartis delivered a 7% increase in third-quarter constant currency sales of $13.9 billion as it continues to grapple with competition for some of its blockbuster drugs. Net income jumped 25% year-on-year to hit $3.9 billion. Analysts had been expecting net income to come in at $4.4 billion, according to a consensus estimate compiled by LSEG.Novartis shares fell 3.4% at the start of the Tuesday trading session. The stock has risen some 17% since the start of the year, outperforming an 8% rise on the Swiss Market Index.The company said its performance in the quarter was driven by growth in sales of drugs including cancer treatments Kisqali, Pluvicto and Scemblix, as well as its multiple sclerosis drug Kesimpta, which all saw high double digit revenue growth.Novartis has raised guidance for the past 10 quarters, including twice this year. Analysts at UBS had expected the drugmaker to up its forecasts again this quarter. However, the drugmaker stuck to its guidance for sales to grow by a \"high single digit\" percentage and adjusted operating income to grow by a \"low teens\" percentage.Its key drugs Entresto, Promacta, and Tasigna are facing loss of exclusivity in the U.S., which resulted in a negative impact of 7 percentage points. Meanwhile, revenue deduction adjustments, mainly in the U.S. led to a negative impact of 2 percentage points due to pricing, the firm said in a Tuesday earnings statement.U.S. drug pricingInvestors are closely watching global updates on tariffs and U.S. President Donald Trump's efforts to lower drug prices for U.S. consumers.Pharma giants Pfizer and AstraZeneca have recently struck \"most favoured nation\" (MFN) agreements with the U.S. administration. The policy aims to slash drug costs by tying the prices of some medicine in the U.S. to the significantly lower ones abroad. For the Pfizer and AstraZeneca deals, it will lower the cost of drugs for U.S. consumers while providing the companies a three-year reprieve from tariffs.\"Following PFE and AZN MFN agreements, we expect more announcements across EU and US pharma in the coming weeks. Broad investor expectation is to see a similar agreement for Novartis. We look to see Novartis's views on the expected impact of any agreement on 2026+ earnings,\" said analysts at UBS.In September, Novartis pledged it would eliminate the price differential between drugs in the U.S. and other industrialized nations. Stock Chart IconStock chart iconNovartis shares year-to-date.When asked about the Pfizer and AstraZeneca MFN agreements, Narasimhan said the company has been in talks with the White House since the start of the year.\"We're, of course, looking to find a good solution to the challenges they've put forward. I think also importantly, we're also trying to tackle some of the bigger structural issues here ... outside of the United States, innovation is not appropriately rewarded,\" the chief executive said.He added that if an agreement was made with the U.S. and prices were to fall stateside, it would likely lead to \"fewer launches in public markets, in the target countries outside of the U.S.\"\"I think prices in the U.S. will adjust, but they'll adjust modestly. I think really what you're going to have is a situation that unless overseas countries — these particularly as the administration is focused on the G7 plus Switzerland and Denmark — if they don't raise their prices up to reward innovation, and on par with the U.S., companies won't launch in the public market in those in those countries,\" Narasimhan told CNBC.In September Novartis also said it would not be impacted by a 100% tariff announced by the White House on branded pharmaceutical products because of its $23 billion investment in U.S. based infrastructure.",

    "body": "Cathie Wood, chief executive officer of Ark Investment Management LLC, during the Federal Reserve's Payments Innovation Conference in Washington, DC, US, on Tuesday, Oct. 21, 2025. Aaron Schartz | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesArk Invest CEO Cathie Wood on Tuesday pushed back on fears of an artificial intelligence bubble, while flagging the possibility of a \"reality check\" on AI valuations.Speaking to CNBC's Dan Murphy on the sidelines of Saudi Arabia's Future Investment Initiative (FII) in Riyadh, Wood said that as interest rates begin to rise, \"there will be a shudder\" in markets.\"We are going to reach a moment in the next year where the conversation will shift from lower interest rates to rising rates,\" the closely watched investor said.\"There are a lot of people out there ... who think that innovation and interest rates are inversely correlated. That is not true over history,\" Wood said.\"I want to disabuse people of that notion. But nonetheless, the way algorithms work these days, we think there will be a reality check, shall we say.\"Her comments come amid concerns of soaring tech valuations as both businesses and investors pour money into the sector.watch nowWood is one of many business leaders to have waded into the AI bubble debate, particularly as AI-driven spending has led to record deals and valuations.Earlier in the month, the International Monetary Fund and Bank of England became the latest financial institutions to warn that global stock markets could be in trouble if investor appetite for artificial intelligence turns sour.IMF chief Kristalina Georgieva offered some blunt advice to investors at the time: \"Buckle up: uncertainty is the new normal and it is here to stay.\"She joined the likes of OpenAI's Sam Altman, JPMorgan boss Jamie Dimon and Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell in warning about the risk of a stock market correction as AI spending surges.Wood: AI is not in a bubbleArk Invest's Wood said Big Tech valuations will make sense in the longer term, however.\"I'm not saying there will never be any corrections. Of course there will, as many people worry: 'OK, is this too much, too soon?' But if our expectations for AI, especially embodied AI in the way that I just described, are correct, we are at the very beginning of a technology revolution,\" Wood said.Asked whether AI was in a bubble right now, Wood replied: \"I do not believe AI is in a bubble. What I do think is, on the enterprise side, it is going to take a while for large corporations to prepare themselves to transform.\"She added: \"It's going to take a company like Palantir going into the largest enterprises and really restructuring them in order to really capitalize on the productivity gains that we think are going to be unleashed by AI.\"Global markets rallied at the start of this week, with investors buoyed by hopes that the U.S. and China could soon reach an agreement on trade. U.S. stocks jumped to fresh records on Monday with Asian markets also seeing solid gains.Investors are closely watching a number of key market catalysts, including Big Tech earnings and a Federal Reserve interest rate decision. The U.S. central bank is widely expected to cut rates for the second time this year.",

    "body": "watch nowAmazon said Tuesday that it will lay off about 14,000 corporate employees, marking the latest cuts in the company's multiyear effort to rein in costs.In a blog post, the company wrote that the layoffs are being carried out to help make the company leaner and less bureaucratic, while it looks to invest in \"our biggest bets\" including generative artificial intelligence.\"This generation of AI is the most transformative technology we've seen since the Internet, and it's enabling companies to innovate much faster than ever before (in existing market segments and altogether new ones),\" Beth Galetti, senior vice president of people experience and technology at Amazon, wrote. \"We're convinced that we need to be organized more leanly, with fewer layers and more ownership, to move as quickly as possible for our customers and businesses.\"The layoffs are expected to ultimately be the largest corporate job cuts in Amazon's history, CNBC previously reported. The cuts could affect as many as 30,000 employees, according to Reuters, which cited sources familiar with the matter.Read more CNBC tech newsOpenAI's spending bonanza has Wall Street focused on capex in Big Tech earnings reportsAI spending is boosting the economy, but many businesses are in survival modeApple begins shipping American-made AI servers from TexasEU says TikTok and Meta broke transparency rules under landmark tech lawAmazon is the nation's second-largest private employer, with more than 1.54 million staffers globally as of the end of the second quarter. That figure is primarily made up of its warehouse workforce.It has roughly 350,000 corporate and tech employees, meaning the 14,000 job cuts represent about 4% of that segment of its workforce.The company indicated that it will continue to lay off employees in the coming year, even as it plans to keep hiring in \"key strategic areas.\"Amazon's job cuts come as companies across industries including tech, banking, auto and retail have pointed to the rise of generative AI as a force that's likely to or already changing the size of their workforces.Several companies have indicated they can hire fewer employees and still grow their revenues, partly as a result of relying more on AI, which they believe will translate to greater efficiencies and productivity.Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said in June that the company's workforce would shrink further as a result of it embracing generative AI, telling staffers that it \"will need fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today, and more people doing other types of jobs.\"Jassy, who took the helm from Jeff Bezos in 2021, has been on a campaign to slash costs across the company over the past few years. Amazon laid off 27,000 employees between 2022 and 2023, and job reductions have continued since then, though at a smaller scale.Amazon is slimming down its workforce after it went on a hiring spree during the Covid-19 pandemic, partly to meet a surge in demand for e-commerce and cloud computing services.The company has since moved to shutter some of its unprofitable initiatives, while committing to invest about $100 billion this year in AI development. Amazon faces growing pressure to show its cloud and AI businesses aren't lagging behind rivals.At the same time, Jassy been trying to overhaul Amazon's corporate culture and operate like the \"world's largest startup\" as it looks to stay competitive. Last September, as part of a mandate requiring corporate employees to work in the office five days a week, he set a goal to flatten organizations across Amazon by the first quarter of this year.Amazon is slated to report its third-quarter results on Thursday after the market closes.",

    "body": "US President Donald Trump speaks to members of the media on the South Lawn of the White House before boarding Marine One in Washington, DC, US, on Saturday, Dec. 13, 2025. Trump said there will be \"serious retaliation\" after two US Army soldiers and an interpreter were killed in Syria on Saturday, and three other Americans were wounded.Samuel Corum | Sipa | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesPresident Donald Trump said in a social media post on Monday that Microsoft will announce changes to ensure that Americans won't see rising utility bills as the company builds more data centers to meet rising artificial intelligence demand.\"I never want Americans to pay higher Electricity bills because of Data Centers,\" Trump wrote on Truth Social. \"Therefore, my Administration is working with major American Technology Companies to secure their commitment to the American People, and we will have much to announce in the coming weeks.\"Ahead of this year's midterm elections, President Trump is trying to find ways to lower prices for consumers, as the effects of tariffs he imposed last year on goods imported to the U.S. ripple across the economy. In December, Trump announced a $1,776 \"warrior dividend\" for U.S soldiers. Earlier this month he demanded the purchase of $200 billion in mortgage bonds with the hope of reducing mortgage rates.Meanwhile, the biggest tech companies are rapidly constructing power-hungry data centers and telling Wall Street that they'll be bolstering their capital expenditures as the AI boom continues. Last week Meta announced agreements with three nuclear power companies for a data center in Ohio.Trump congratulated Microsoft on its efforts to keep prices in check, suggesting that other companies will make similar commitments.\"First up is Microsoft, who my team has been working with, and which will make major changes beginning this week to ensure that Americans don't 'pick up the tab' for their POWER consumption, in the form of paying higher Utility bills,\" Trump wrote on Monday.Microsoft didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. Utilities charged U.S. consumers 6% more for electricity in August from a year earlier, including in states with many data centers, CNBC reported in November. Microsoft is paying close to attention to the impact of its data centers on local residents. \"I just want you to know we are doing everything we can, and I believe we're succeeding, in managing this issue well, so that you all don't have to pay more for electricity because of our presence,\" Brad Smith, the company's president and vice chair, said at a September town hall meeting in Wisconsin, where Microsoft is building an AI data center. While Microsoft is moving forward with some facilities, the company withdrew plans for a data center in Caledonia, Wisconsin, amid loud opposition to its efforts there. The project would would have been located 20 miles away from a data center in the village of Mount Pleasant.WATCH: Meta signs nuclear energy deals with Oklo, Vistra, and TerraPower to support its AI ambitionswatch now",

    "body": "watch nowJPMorgan Chase on Tuesday posted fourth-quarter results that topped expectations on better-than-expected revenue from the bank's trading operations. Here's what the company reported:Adjusted earnings: $5.23 per share vs. $5 consensus estimate from LSEGRevenue: $46.77 billion vs. $46.201 billion expected by LSEGThe company said profit fell 7% to $13.03 billion, or $4.63 per share, because of a pre-announced $2.2 billion reserve tied to its takeover of the Apple Card loan portfolio from Goldman Sachs. Excluding the 60-cent-per-share hit from that transaction, adjusted earnings came in at $5.23 and topped analysts' expectations.Companywide revenue rose 7% to $46.77 billion as net interest income also rose by 7% to $25.1 billion, roughly matching analyst expectations for NII, according to StreetAccount. Equities trading revenue surged 40% to $2.9 billion, about $350 million more than analysts had expected, as the company cited strength across operations, especially in its business catering to hedge funds. Fixed income trading revenue rose 7% to $5.4 billion, about $110 million more than expected, according to StreetAccount.Investment banking, however, appeared to disappoint, as fees fell 5% to $2.3 billion, roughly $210 million below the StreetAccount estimate. Shares of the bank climbed less than 1% in premarket trading. Banks have enjoyed a Goldilocks-type environment for the last few quarters, with a rebound in Wall Street trading, falling interest rates, stable consumer credit and deregulation providing a lift for the sector. High stock levels have also buoyed banks' wealth management divisions.The KBW Bank Index climbed 29% last year, the second year in a row that the big bank benchmark exceeded the gains of the S&P 500.In remarks in the earnings release, JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon called the U.S. economy resilient.\"While labor markets have softened, conditions do not appear to be worsening. Meanwhile, consumers continue to spend, and businesses generally remain healthy,\" Dimon said.\"These conditions could persist for some time, particularly with ongoing fiscal stimulus, the benefits of deregulation and the Fed's recent monetary policy,\" he said. \"However, as usual, we remain vigilant, and markets seem to underappreciate the potential hazards—including from complex geopolitical conditions, the risk of sticky inflation and elevated asset prices.\"Analysts will be keen to hear how much banking momentum from 2025 is expected to carry over into this year. Of particular concern is whether there are any cracks in spending amid signs that the labor market may be weakening, as well as guidance around the strength of Wall Street dealmaking. Bank of America, Citigroup and Wells Fargo are scheduled to report results Wednesday, with Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley reporting Thursday. This story is developing.

    "body": "A turbine blade is lifted onto a rack near tower sections at the Revolution Wind project assembly site at State Pier in New London, Connecticut, US, on Friday, Oct. 24, 2025.Bloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesShares of Danish renewables giant Orsted rose nearly 5% on Tuesday morning, shortly after a U.S. judge cleared the company to resume work on its nearly finished Revolution Wind project.In a statement, Orsted welcomed the ruling from the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, saying the action would allow the company \"to restart impacted activities immediately.\"The ruling is a legal setback for the pro-fossil fuel Trump administration, which moved to block the $5 billion Revolution Wind project.The White House halted five major offshore wind developments at the end of last year, including Orsted's project off the coast of Rhode Island. Officials cited national security concerns identified by the Pentagon as the reason for the suspension.Orsted filed a legal challenge to the Trump administration's decision earlier this month, saying that the lease suspension would cause \"substantial harm\" to the Revolution Wind project.In a hearing on Monday, U.S. District Judge Royce Lamberth said the Court should be \"very skeptical of the government's true motives\" for putting a stop to the project, according to Reuters news agency.\"You want to stop everything in place, costing them one-and-a-half million a day, while you decide what you want to do?\" Lamberth asked Justice Department attorney Peter Torstensen.A spokesperson for the U.S. Interior Department did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment.Read moreMichael Field, chief equity strategist at Morningstar, said the U.S. judge's decision was clearly welcome news for the likes of Orsted and Danish wind turbine maker Vestas but warned of further industry uncertainty.\"It's certainly a win for these companies anyway — and they have had such a hard time over the last year or so that they could definitely use that,\" Field told CNBC's \"Squawk Box Europe\" on Tuesday.\"But … whether Trump will find a way around this or find some other way to maybe go at these companies is the question. So, I wouldn't be completely celebrating as of yet,\" he added.Revolution Wind is a 50/50 joint venture between Orsted and Global Infrastructure Partners' Skyborn Renewables. In a filing last year, Orsted and Skyborn Renewables said they had already spent approximately $5 billion on the project.Shares of Orsted traded 4.5% higher at around 10 a.m. London time (5 a.m. ET). Vestas, meanwhile, was last seen up around 1.6%. Shares of Norway's Equinor, whose Empire Wind 1 project was also impacted, were last seen 2.7% higher. U.S.-listed Dominion Energy, the developer of the halted Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind project, the largest of its kind in America, was flat in pre-market trade. ",

    "body": "watch nowBank executives were sent scrambling over the weekend after President Donald Trump declared late Friday that American credit card companies would be subject to a 10% cap on the interest rate they can charge customers.The move sent shares of large banks including Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo and Bank of America down between 1% and 3% Monday. Companies more tightly tethered to the card industry, like Visa, Mastercard and American Express, also fell. Capital One, whose loan book is mostly from credit cards, sank nearly 7%.Trump proposed a one-year cap on interest rates starting Jan. 20. While it's unclear exactly how that would be enforced, the industry's message is clear: the plan would bring unintended consequences for consumers and the American economy.The move would make large swaths of the credit card industry unprofitable, especially tied to customers with less-than-ideal credit profiles, according to banks and analysts. The average credit card rate nationally is 19.7% as of this month, according to a weekly survey from Bankrate.com, while rates for subprime borrowers and store-specific cards are even higher.Rather than offer loss-making products to consumers, the industry would simply stop offering access to customers with subprime credit, along with a slew of other changes around card programs including scaling back rewards, insiders say. Consumers would either spend less or rely on other forms of unsecured debt, many of which carry even higher interest rates than credit cards, they say.\"We cannot offer products at a loss; there's no scenario where we would take our entire portfolio to 10%,\" said a person with knowledge of the operations of a large bank, who asked to remain anonymous to speak candidly. \"It's not a stretch to suggest this will very quickly tank the economy.\"watch nowThe drag on the economy from less spending could be more acute for airlines, retailers and restaurants, which would have to make up for lost card revenues by \"potentially raising pricing\" on their services, KBW analysts led by Sanjay Sakhrani and Chris McGratty said in a Jan. 11 research note.The industry's trade groups issued a joint statement late Friday making their case.\"Evidence shows that a 10% interest rate cap would reduce credit availability and be devastating for millions of American families and small business owners who rely on and value their credit cards, the very consumers this proposal intends to help,\" the trade groups said.(L-R) Wells Fargo CEO and President Charles Scharf, Brian Bank of America Chairman and CEO Thomas Moynihan, JPMorgan Chase Chairman and CEO Jamie Dimon, Citigroup CEO Jane Fraser, State Street CEO Ronald OÕHanley, BNY Mellon CEO Robin Vince, Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon and Morgan Stanley CEO James Gorman, testify during a Wall Street oversight hearing by the Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs committee on Capitol Hill in Washington, DC, December 6, 2023.Saul Loeb | AFP | Getty Images'Opening bid?'This isn't the industry's first time contending with possible price controls. A bill was introduced last year from Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri and Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont that would limit card APRs at 10% for five years.While that bill is stalled in Congress, a study released Monday on possible impacts from the Electronic Payments Coalition found that a 10% cap on rates would mean that card issuers would close accounts for nearly 90% of current users, or 175 million Americans. Most accounts with credit scores below 740 would be shut, the study claimed.Complicating matters, it is unclear to bankers how Trump's rate cap would take place.The most straightforward approach, through legislation in Congress, isn't possible by the proposed Jan. 20 start date, said Tobin Marcus, head of U.S. policy at Wolfe Research.Other enforcement means, through banking regulators including the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, are also possible. But the Trump administration has repeatedly tried to shutter that agency, and the industry has had a successful run at defeating CFPB rules in federal courts. \"I'm not aware of an authority that they can use to do this unilaterally in any kind of a sweeping way,\" Marcus said. \"As far as I can tell, telling them they have until Jan. 20 is an attempt to create pressure and have them do it voluntarily.\"While the exact mechanism that Trump can use to enforce an interest rate cap is unclear, card issuers now face the risk that rates could be headed lower in some form of negotiated compromise with the government, KBW's McGratty said in an interview.\"Is 10% an opening bid?\" he said. \"There's a long distance between 10% and what companies charge today.\"Americans had a collective $1.23 trillion in credit card debt as of the third quarter last year, according to data from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Balances have been climbing as many Americans spent down the savings they'd built up during the global coronavirus pandemic.Correction: This story has been updated to correct the spelling of Capital One.

    "body": "Paramount Skydance CEO, David Ellison and CEO of Warner Bros. Discovery, David Zaslav.David A. Grogan | CNBC| Patrick T. Fallon | AFP | Getty Images |It is extremely rare for a merger and acquisition story to break out from the business pages. Yet, when it comes to the sale process of Warner Brothers Discovery it has become mainstream news as probably the most compelling media industry story of the last 12 months. I suppose it is fairly obvious as to why, with such universally known media brands involved in the fray from Netflix, HBO, Paramount, CBS, CNN and MTV. These are media brands of real significance so one might assume who owns it is a significant issue in itself.But is it?There are a number of perspectives from which to answer this question. Should TV viewers care? Should policy makers care? Should the industry care? Should President Donald Trump care? And, probably most importantly, should shareholders care?David Ellison, newly installed CEO of Paramount and son of one of the world's wealthiest billionaires, Larry Ellison, decided to make an aggressive move to attempt to acquire all of Warner prior to Warner's decision to split itself into two companies. One company was to consist of HBO and the Warner movie and TV studios, and another created holding all the Warner cable networks, which include CNN. Ellison made this preemptive move to capture the Warner assets, correctly strategizing that Paramount would be the only bidder for the entire company. However, his move catalyzed the Warner board to entertain bids for just the studios and HBO as well, which then created a highly competitive bidding situation. In a move that industry analysts considered extremely surprising, Netflix made a very aggressive bid for the HBO and the Warner studios, and was able to convince the board that its $27.75 per share offer of mostly cash and some Netflix stock, was more valuable than the $30 per share that Paramount offered for the whole company, because it was leaving behind the cable networks which the Warner board valued as worth more than the difference between the two bids. The Warner board also strongly believed that the Netflix offer had terms that made its offer carry greater certainty to close than the Paramount offer. The Ellisons have now decided to go hostile and take their offer to shareholders and this has sparked enormous debate about who should own these assets. WBD's board told shareholders to reject this latest hostile bid on Jan. 7.Does it matter to viewers?First, from a consumer point of view, television viewers care about having substantial amount of choice, at reasonable prices, with plenty of quality productions. Since all the major streaming services seek today is greater engagement — meaning more viewers watching for longer periods of time — whoever owns the Warner studios and HBO will have plenty of incentive to produce more than they currently do and maintain the perception of high quality that HBO commands amongst consumers. Either buyer will serve this consumer interest.The anti-Netflix argument is that since Netflix is the far bigger streaming service today than Paramount+, that it will command sufficient market power to raise price in a way that will be detrimental to streaming subscribers. However, Netflix has pursued a pricing strategy that actually offers the lowest cost service for subscribers that are willing to accept ads, and the highest price service for those who do not want advertisements. This strategy has worked incredibly well for them and there is little reason to think this approach would change, of offering its entire service at the lowest cost. Moreover, as Netflix has argued, being able to offer Netflix and HBO services as a discounted bundle might well provide substantial savings over the status quo for those subscribers that have both services, which is the vast majority of HBO subs. In addition, Paramount, like some of the other services that are much smaller than Netflix and struggling for profitability, have a need to continue to substantially increase the price of their services.Of particular note when considering the issue of consumer choice, Netflix has indicated it will keep the HBO service alive, whereas Paramount+ and HBO are likely to merge into a single stronger service which one might argue will eliminate some degree of choice for consumers, compared to keeping HBO alive as a separate offering.Nevertheless, whoever wins this bidding war will be subject to regulatory review, and that poses questions of competition which is what policymakers most concern themselves with. It is hard to argue that Paramount+ is not a subscale service that badly needs to combine with another player in order to compete with the larger players in the market such as Disney and Amazon, and of course, Netflix. So, yes, competition will be enhanced by Paramount+ combining with HBO to become a stronger streaming player, but just because it is more pro-competitive for Paramount to acquire Warner, however, that does not mean it is anti-competitive under the antitrust laws for Netflix to absorb the Warner properties. What's best for Hollywood?So, let's look at this issue from an industry perspective. Paramount has announced it plans to cut costs far more aggressively once the companies are merged than Netflix anticipates doing so. While much of those cuts will come on the cable side which Netflix would not be buying, many of those cuts will also come from HBO and Paramount+ combining, and maybe more importantly from the Paramount and Warner studios combining. Beyond jobs, combining the Paramount and Warner studios would reduce the number of major studios producing theatrical motion pictures which clearly reduces competition — just as Disney's acquisition in recent years of 20th Century Fox eliminated the latter as a major studio player. The industry counter argument is that Netflix has not been a believer in movie theater distribution and would look to put its output on its streaming service and substantially reduce what plays theatrically. Yet, the response to that argument is Netflix has made very little impact in the media zeitgeist as a producer of movies as compared to its television series, while it has been able to garner substantial viewership from movies that it licenses from third party studios. The difference there is that those licensed movies have had theatrical runs with all the promotional marketing that goes along with those releases, and there is good reason to believe that in order to drive greater engagement of viewers when it comes to movies on Netflix that they would maintain movie theater distribution in order to drive the type of promotional awareness that have made for successful movie runs on the streaming service. There is the further industry issue of how do you even measure competition when it comes to television viewership. Paramount would like regulators to define the relevant market as being streaming services that air long-form tv shows and movies, because under that analysis Netflix combined with HBO Max would have about a 28% market share, whereas Paramount plus HBO Max would only have about a 7% share. This approach would exclude YouTube's first place share of connected TV streaming viewing of 24%. Yet with YouTube included, the Netflix/HBO Max share of streaming to the tv set audience is only about 20%, still below YouTube's viewing share. With YouTube having just bid the Oscars away from Disney/ABC and the Disney streaming services, it is hard to argue that YouTube should not be considered as part of the relevant TV market. The real critical number though is that HBO Max's share of streaming viewing is only 2.6%, so in any event it adds a nominal amount of increased viewership to Netflix, and the resulting Netflix share would not typically rise to the level of concentration that would cause regulators to upset a transaction. The better argument for Netflix actually is that it doesn't just compete in the streaming universe, but for the majority of television households today that still receive traditional broadcast and cable channels, those channels are still significant competition for viewing eyeballs — and when those traditional channels are included Netflix only has about an 8% viewing share, and is only in sixth place well behind Paramount. In fact, when considering the totality of television channels and streaming services together, Paramount's acquisition of Warner would catapult it to first place, even ahead of YouTube, when it comes to total viewership based on Nielsen's latest numbers.When it comes to the advertising revenue which attaches to this viewership Netflix ad revenues are still very nascent, and with the addition of HBO Max ad revenue, would still be a small percentage of overall TV advertising. Paramount's much larger ad revenue would close to double with the acquisition, but neither outcome would substantially change competitive dynamics in the TV ad industry. Regulators would also look at the industry concern as to whether the number of players available to license or acquire shows produced by others would involve a reduction in competition. Whether the buyer of Warner was Netflix or Paramount in either case there would be one less buyer of third-party produced TV shows. So on that score, it is hard to claim one buyer or the other makes a competitive difference. Netflix today might have a much bigger programming budget, but Paramount has already proven that it will bid more aggressively for key licensing rights than any other bidder in the marketplace.What does it mean for the news business?While Netflix would not be acquiring CNN, Paramount would be, and it plans to combine CBS News and CNN which would be a smart rationalization of substantial news operations overhead. However, in the course of accomplishing that there would be a reduction of six major broadcast and cable news organizations down to five, a clear elimination of a competitor just as the case would be with Paramount's acquisition of the Warner studios. While many industry observers would bemoan CNN coming under more conservative leaning editorial leadership, in terms of editorial diversity in the overall media marketplace, it would be hard to argue that the opinions and editorial approach CNN represents can't otherwise be found by viewers elsewhere in their diet of news programming choices.So, there are pluses and minuses for consumers and the industry depending on who bought the Warner properties, but there is no clear-cut case that one outcome is better or worse than the other for consumers or the industry.Trump's influenceNot that this should play any role here in determining an outcome, what about the interests of President Trump?Paramount very much thought it had the inside track to getting Trump's blessing on the acquisition, and the President has made no secret of the fact that he plans to weigh in on an unprecedented basis regarding regulatory approval. While he has clear political ties to Larry Ellison, the President's outlook towards Netflix looks pretty benign. However, there is no doubt Trump wants CNN under different ownership because of its current editorial slant, which could well mean if Paramount does not succeed in acquiring all of Warner, he would be less pleased with the outcome. Yet, there seems to be interest in third parties acquiring CNN, or the whole Warner cable bundle including CNN, and Trump could influence regulatory approval of a CNN deal to a new owner so that it is not left to be spun-off for current Warner management to operate. The fact is Trump has been less than fully satisfied with the performance of CBS News, which is owned by Paramount, since Ellison took it over. So Trump standing in the way of a Netflix acquisition of HBO and the Warner studios because of the ultimate fate of CNN seems like a long shot.Alternatively, if Netflix was to acquire HBO and the studios, Paramount might still acquire the cable assets as a way of bulking up the traditional side of the company and having an opportunity to still take out very substantial cost, including the consolidation of CNN and CBS News. In the end, it appears that the only ones who should really care about the outcome here are the shareholders of the three respective companies, where Warner shareholders clearly care about getting the highest price with the greatest certainty that it will be paid, and the Warner board is going to have to be meticulous in making sure that whatever decision they make is guided by that metric. Larry Ellison has now agreed to personally guarantee the Paramount bid, which largely removes the uncertainty around the equity financing the Warner board had been concerned about — though the board has raised issues surrounding the debt financing — so the question of which offer provides a better price and greater certainty for shareholders is still at issue. Beyond the interests of shareholders, with there being pros and cons running in both directions, it is hard to see that either outcome rises to the level that anybody should really care who ends up owning Warner. Tom Rogers was the first president, NBC Cable and the founder, CNBC. He is a CNBC contributor, senior advisor to Versant (CNBC's parent company) and executive chairman, of AI company Claigrid, Inc.

    "body": "A visitor takes a picture of a model of SK hynix's high-bandwidth memory (HBM) technology during the 2025 World IT Show in Seoul on April 24, 2025.Jung Yeon-je | Afp | Getty ImagesSouth Korea-based memory maker SK Hynix announced Tuesday it will invest 19 trillion Korean won ($12.9 billion) to build a new advanced packaging plant, as it expands production to meet rising demands tied to artificial intelligence. The new facility will be located in the Korean city of Cheongju, building on the company's existing footprint there. Construction is set to begin in April, with completion targeted for the end of 2027, the firm said in a statement.The plant will focus on advanced packaging, which involves combining multiple memory chips into a single, high-density unit to improve performance and energy efficiency while reducing overall size.SK Hynix is among the world's largest producers of memory chips and leads in so-called high-bandwidth memory (HBM), which is used in artificial intelligence processors, including those designed by U.S. chipmaker Nvidia. The investment comes as SK Hynix seeks to meet growing demand for HBM as global AI competition intensifies, a trend that has pushed up prices and made it lucrative for memory giants.SK Hynix rival Samsung Electronics has also announced plans to ramp up HBM production in recent months.According to industry projections cited by SK Hynix, the HBM market is expected to expand at a compound annual growth rate of 33% between 2025 and 2030.However, the process of producing HBM memory is much more demanding than that for memory used in most consumer electronics. As chipmakers shift to meet AI-driven demand, supplies of conventional memory have tightened, contributing to price hikes and raising concerns about higher costs across the broader electronics industry.TrendForce, a Taipei-based tech research firm, said last week that it expects average dynamic random access memory prices, including HBM, to rise by 50% to 55% this quarter compared with the fourth quarter of 2025. Dynamic Random Access Memory, or DRAM, generally refers to the primary, volatile memory found in most computers for temporary data storage.While higher memory prices have created challenges for electronics manufacturers, they have boosted earnings for memory producers. Samsung said last week it expects operating profit for the December quarter to nearly triple from the same period last year. Meanwhile, SK Hynix is weighing a potential U.S. listing following a blockbuster 2025 for its shares in South Korea. The stock is up about 12% since the start of this year, though it fell roughly 2.5% in Tuesday trading.",

    "body": "A Venezuelan living in Colombia waves a Venezuelan flag and a U.S. flag at Plaza de Bolivar to celebrate after U.S. President Donald Trump said the U.S. has struck Venezuela and captured its President Nicolás Maduro and his wife Cilia Flores, in Bogota, Colombia, Jan. 3, 2026. Andres Galeano | ReutersVenezuela's stock market has not only shrugged off the capture of former President Nicolás Maduro by U.S. forces, it has surged to a record high as investors bet that the battered economy could finally see a turnaround.The country's benchmark Indice Bursatil de Capitalizacion, or IBC, has gained more than 130% since the U.S. operation on Jan. 3. The rally reflects optimism that Venezuela's economy could stabilize after years of mismanagement, sanctions and defaults, with expectations growing that a reconfigured government may attract capital, revive oil output and normalize relations with the United States, analysts said.And investors are trying to get in on the action. U.S. ETF issuer Teucrium on Friday applied to the Securities and Exchange Commission to create what would reportedly be the first exchange-traded fund focused on companies with exposure to Venezuela. \"In what is a fluid environment, we currently believe that Venezuela is more likely to experience regime continuity with behavioral realignment, rather than an outright democratic transition or system collapse,\" BMI said in a note. \"A pliant Venezuela would allow the U.S. to reinforce its regional hegemony, secure access to the oil sector on very favorable terms.\"\"Investors began to price in Maduro's removal from power as a precondition for sanctions relief and eventually a restructuring deal,\" said Anthony Simond, investment director at UK-based wealth and investments firm Aberdeen.Simond said demand is coming from a broad mix of investors, including mainstream emerging-market asset managers, as well as hedge funds and distressed-debt specialists seeking asymmetric upside. However, it is important to note that Venezuela's stock exchange is small, illiquid and not easily accessible to global investors, meaning price swings can be extreme, strategists said. Venezuela's IBC soared 1,644% in 2025.\"Because Venezuela's markets are thinly traded, even small shifts in expectations can cause large price moves,\" Alice Blue, an integrated brokerage of financial charting platform TradingView wrote in a note. \"The rally reflects hope and speculation, not confirmed outcomes.\"Investors have also rushed into the country's sovereign and state oil company bonds since Maduro was captured. Renewed interest in Venezuelan bonds is primarily driven by optimism around potential debt restructuring, a development investors see as a way to unlock value frozen since Venezuela's 2017 default, said Jeff Grills, head of U.S. cross markets and emerging markets debt at Aegon Asset Management. Grills cautioned though that much of the stock rally is headline-driven. \"At this stage, the rally appears to be largely tactical, rather than the start of a structural re-rating,\" he said, noting that leadership changes alone do not yet amount to a full regime transition. Venezuela's external liabilities, including arbitration claims and bilateral debts — estimated at $150 billion to $170 billion, according to Reuters — complicates any recovery timeline, said Eric Fine, a portfolio manager from VanEck.\"Everything depends on that not being derailed. [However] if that materializes, this is a complete re-rating situation,\" he said.",

Banks overall have also benefited from several deregulatory efforts under Trump administration regulators. \"We're increasing our medium-term targets, because we have the confidence that we think there's a lot more value and potential for us to unlock over the long term,\" Vince said in an interview, adding that medium-term targets had a 3- to 5-year horizon.\"Three years in, we've really demonstrated a track record of execution and strong performance, which gives us confidence that the strategy is working and that there's a clear turnaround that's happening at the company,\" he said.

    "body": "watch nowPrecious metals are jumping to records. The U.S dollar is dropping. Stocks are whipsawing.Monday is all about the \"Sell America\" trade after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's bombshell announcement that he's under criminal investigation — which market participants see as a sign of President Donald Trump's interest in stripping away the central bank's political independence.\"This is unambiguously risk off,\" said Krishna Guha, head of global policy and central bank strategy at Evercore ISI.Guha said a so-called Sell America trade could play out similarly to what was seen in April, when the stock market cratered after Trump first announced his plan for broad and steep tariffs. Global investors will place a higher risk-premium on U.S. assets, while safe-haven trades like gold should take a leg up as a response to the turmoil, he said.The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell nearly 500 points at one point in morning trading, while the U.S. dollar index shed 0.2%. But the popular safe-haven trades of gold and silver surged to all-time highs in the session.\"Clearly, the market doesn't like it,\" Ed Yardeni, president of Yardeni Research, told CNBC on Monday.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconGold COMEX, all-timeJPMorgan's trading team also highlighted \"Sell America\" as a major driver for the market on Monday. Beyond the Powell investigation, the desk pointed out that oral arguments at the Supreme Court are scheduled for the case on whether Trump can fire Fed Governor Lisa Cook later this month. On top of that, bank stocks dropped after Trump called for a one-year credit card interest rate cap of 10%.\"Combined, the 'Sell America' theme may be the dominant narrative,\" JPMorgan wrote to clients.To be sure, JPMorgan said the macro and corporate backdrop support having a tactically bullish stance on the stock market. However, the team said the overhang caused by concerns around Fed independence offers reason for caution in the short term.How concerned is the market?In a video statement, Powell framed the probe as being driven by the fact that the Fed has set interest rates by what it believes is best for the economy, rather than by \"following the preferences of the president.\" Trump has repeatedly chastised Powell over what he sees as too high of rates and previously floated removing the Fed chair from his post.Markets had become used to such \"hostile jawboning\" and stopped trading around the Fed's independence without further proof of risk, according to Evercore ISI's Guha. But Powell's investigation announcement can offer a reason to make worries about Fed independence once again top of mind for traders, he said.Economists have widely come out in support of Powell and emphasized that they see the investigation as an attack on the Fed's apolitical stature. Former Fed Chair Janet Yellen on Monday told CNBC she was \"surprised the market isn't more concerned.\"The CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) — also known as Wall Street's fear gauge — rose in Monday's session. But it did not break outside of its recent range, which can mean investors aren't yet sure that this will be a long-term story. Stocks rebounded off lows in Monday's session by late morning, further signaling that investors may be hesitant to commit to the \"Sell America\" trade until there are more indications that Trump will go forward with the credit card plan and his attempt to cast out Powell. The S&P 500 climbed to a new all-time high after trading down earlier in the day.Still, international markets outperformed U.S. stocks — with the iShares MSCI ACWI ex US ETF (ACWX) advancing about 0.8% — underscoring the Fed-related stress on investors.\"Volatility is likely to dominate markets in the near term,\" said Mark Malek, investing chief at Siebert Financial. But the VIX's muted move shows \"that investors expect all this to blow over, or that they simply don't want to focus on this as we enter Q4 earnings season later this week.\"— CNBC's Jeff Cox contributed to this report.",

    "body": "ReutersSen. Mark Kelly on Monday sued the Pentagon and Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, alleging the Trump administration's efforts to punish the Arizona Democrat for his participation in a video to U.S. troops violate the Constitution.The federal civil lawsuit in U.S. District Court in Washington was filed one week after Hegseth said his department would cut Kelly's military retirement pay in response to the video.The government's actions \"trample on protections the Constitution singles out as essential to legislative independence,\" Kelly's lawyers wrote in the lawsuit, which was also filed against the U.S. Navy Department and its secretary, John Phelan.\"It appears that never in our nation's history has the Executive Branch imposed military sanctions on a Member of Congress for engaging in disfavored political speech,\" the lawyers wrote.The legal complaint alleges that the defendants violated Kelly's right to freedom of speech, as well as his protection under the Constitution's \"speech or debate clause,\" which prevents executive action against members of Congress for their legislative conduct. The suit also alleges infringements of Kelly's due process rights and the separation of powers, among other violations.A Pentagon official told CNBC in a statement that the department is aware of the lawsuit, but that its policy is not to comment on ongoing litigation.The video at the center of the fight featured Kelly and five other congressional Democrats delivering a message addressed to U.S. troops and members of the intelligence community.\"Our laws are clear: You can refuse illegal orders,\" Kelly said in the 90-second video, which was first posted on social media on Nov. 18.It was shared as the U.S. military carried out a succession of airstrikes in the Caribbean targeting boats purported to be smuggling drugs.Members of Congress, including some Republicans, had questioned the legality of those deadly strikes, which were made without congressional authorization. The attacks have continued, killing 123 people since early September, according to The New York Times.The other lawmakers in the video, who all served in the military or in U.S. intelligence, each made a similar statement about troops being allowed to refuse unlawful orders.But Kelly, a former U.S. Navy captain and NASA astronaut, is the only one who formally retired from service, and therefore remains subject to the Uniform Code of Military Justice.Days later, Hegseth slammed the video as \"despicable, reckless, and false,\" while labeling its participants the \"Seditious Six.\" Read more CNBC politics coverageSen.

Kelly, in response, vowed to \"fight this with everything I've got.\"",

    "body": "A Delta Air Lines Boeing 767-332(ER).Joan Valls | Nurphoto | Getty ImagesDelta Air Lines' earnings could jump more than 20% this year from 2025 thanks to robust travel demand, particularly at the high end of the market, and potentially reach a record, CEO Ed Bastian said.Delta on Tuesday forecast adjusted earnings per share of between $6.50 and $7.50 this year, compared with analysts' estimate for $7.25 a share.The carrier, the first airline to report quarterly results this year, forecast an increase in sales of as much as 7% in the first three months of 2026 and adjusted earnings of between 50 cents per share and 90 cents per share for the first quarter, compared with 72 cents per share forecast by analysts polled by LSEG.Bastian said Delta sits at the top of the \"K\" in the so-called K-shaped economy, with more revenue coming from higher-spending customers.\"We are looking at our seat growth in the coming year. ... Effectively, none of our growth in seats will be in the main cabin; virtually all will be in the premium sector,\" Bastian told reporters.Main cabin ticket revenue fell 7% in the fourth quarter from a year earlier to $5.62 billion, while premium ticket revenue, for seats at the front of the plane, rose 9% to nearly $5.7 billion, with that segment overtaking the standard coach class, ahead of Delta's estimate for it to occur this year. For the full year, main cabin revenue was still higher than premium classes.Bookings are strong from both leisure customers and corporate travelers in the first few days of the year, Delta said. The airline also started 2025 with expectations for a record year, but it trimmed its estimates after President Donald Trump implemented tariffs early last year and the longest-ever government shutdown, which ended in late November, snarled air travel and bookings fell.Bastian struck a more cautious tone this year, telling reporters \"we're not going to project or commit to a record earnings [forecast] until we understand the uncertainty,\" he said. \"I think we're well aware of the risk factors,\" he said. \"This past year, and I think again this year ... [will] be more of the geopolitical environment, whether that's international or on domestic policy.\"Here's how the company performed in the fourth quarter compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on consensus estimates from LSEG:Earnings per share: $1.55 adjusted vs. $1.53 expectedRevenue: $14.61 billion adjusted vs. $14.69 billion expectedEven with its reduced forecast, Delta posted a profit of $1.22 billion for the fourth quarter, or $1.86 a share, up close to 45% from a year earlier, on revenue of $16 billion, up 3% from 2025. Adjusting for one-time items, Delta posted earnings of $1.02 billion or $1.55 a share, slightly ahead of estimates. Bastian said premium product growth is outpacing sales growth for the main cabin, continuing an existing trend.Read more CNBC airline newsBoeing's deliveries are highest in 7 years.

    "body": "watch nowRepublican protests are growing louder on Capitol Hill as the Trump administration's Department of Justice pursues a criminal investigation into Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. Powell on Sunday night revealed that the Justice Department opened an investigation into his handling of renovations to the central bank's headquarters and his testimony about the matter to Congress. Powell said the investigation was an attempt to intimidate him by \"threatening a criminal indictment\" as he lowers interest rates at a slower pace than President Donald Trump desires. U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia Jeanine Pirro on Monday defended the investigation in a post to X and downplayed that a potential indictment is coming, arguing the \"word 'indictment' has come out of Mr. Powell's mouth, no one else's.\"\"The United States Attorney's Office contacted the Federal Reserve on multiple occasions to discuss cost overruns and the chairman's congressional testimony, but were ignored, necessitating the use of legal process—which is not a threat,\" Pirro said. \"None of this would have happened if they had just responded to our outreach. This office makes decisions based on the merits, nothing more and nothing less.\"The GOP resistance could derail Trump's eventual pick to succeed Powell when the Fed chief's term is up in May, as North Carolina Republican Sen. Thom Tillis, a member of the Senate Banking Committee, threatens to block any nominee to the central bank until the investigation is resolved. Tillis' comments are now being echoed by other Republicans. Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, wrote in a post on X, that the \"administration's investigation is nothing more than an attempt at coercion,\" and called for a congressional investigation into the matter. \"If the Department of Justice believes an investigation into Chair Powell is warranted based on project cost overruns—which are not unusual—then Congress needs to investigate the Department of Justice,\" Murkowski said. \"The stakes are too high to look the other way: if the Federal Reserve loses its independence, the stability of our markets and the broader economy will suffer. My colleague, Senator Tillis, is right in blocking any Federal Reserve nominees until this is resolved.\" Tillis' block is a massive problem for Trump, who has long sought to oust Powell and replace him with an ally. The Banking Committee is comprised of 13 Republicans and 11 Democrats, meaning one Republican defection can cause a deadlock and block a nominee from advancing. Trump has repeatedly said he plans to replace Powell when his term as Fed chair is up in May. However, Powell could stay on as a governor until 2028. And the chorus of Republicans criticizing the administration over the investigation is only getting louder as fears intensify about politicizing the central bank. Read more CNBC politics coverageSen.

Thom Tillis vows to block Trump's Fed nominees following Powell probeFed Chair Powell under criminal investigation, won't bow to Trump intimidationICE Minneapolis shooting: Noem to deploy hundreds more federal agents to citySen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, told reporters on Monday that the investigation \"raise[s] a lot of disturbing questions.\" \"This potential indictment is not something I ever would have expected,\" Collins said, noting that she had not yet reviewed the comments Powell made that the Justice Department is investigating. \"And one can't help but wonder if that's more to do with the chairman's resistance to the pressure from the White House when it comes to the interest rates.\" Sen. John Kennedy, R-La., who sits on the Banking Committee, warned that further conflict between the Fed and the White House could cause economic turmoil. \"I know Chairman Powell very well, I will be stunned, I will be shocked if he has done anything wrong,\" Kennedy said. \"If you wanted to design a system to guarantee that interest rates would go up and not down, the best way to do that would be to have the Federal Reserve and the executive branch of the United States get in a pissing contest.\"\"We need this like we need a hole in the head,\" Kennedy said. Rep. French Hill, an Arkansas Republican who chairs the House Financial Services Committee, also weighed in on the matter. \"Pursuing criminal charges relating to his testimony on building renovations at a time when the nation's economy requires focus and creates an unnecessary distraction,\" Hill said. \"The Federal Reserve is led by strong, capable individuals appointed by President Trump, and this action could undermine this and future Administrations' ability to make sound monetary policy decisions,\" he said. Even Sen. Kevin Cramer, R-N.D., a Banking Committee member who is a frequent Powell critic, criticized the investigation. \"Jerome Powell is a bad Fed Chair who has been elusive with Congress, especially regarding the overruns of the elaborate renovations of the building,\" Cramer said. \"I do not believe however, he is a criminal. I hope this criminal investigation can be put to rest quickly, along with the remainder of Jerome Powell's term. We need to restore confidence in the Fed.\"CNBC has reached out to Senate Banking Committee Chair Tim Scott, R-S.C., for comment on the investigation into Powell.Trump does have one ally, however, in his administration's push to investigate Powell: Sen Cynthia Lummis, R-Wyo. \"Whether Chairman Powell was unprepared for his testimony or intentionally misled Congress about the Fed's extravagant spending, the American people deserve answers. I will wait for the DOJ to release its findings before commenting further,\" Lummis said.  CNBC has reached out to the White House for a response to the members' complaints. This story is developing.

    "body": "U.S. President Donald Trump takes questions from reporters, as he attends a meeting with oil industry executives, at the White House in Washington, D.C., U.S., Jan. 9, 2026. Kevin Lamarque | ReutersPresident Donald Trump on Monday said any country doing business with Iran will face a 25% tariff \"on any and all business being done with the United States of America.\"That new tariff on imports from Iran's trading partners is \"effective immediately,\" Trump said in a Truth Social post.\"This Order is final and conclusive. Thank you for your attention to this matter!\" he wrote.Further details about the tariff announcement were not immediately clear. A White House official declined to answer CNBC's questions about the president's social media post.The apparent effort by Trump to economically isolate Iran comes as the oil-rich Middle Eastern country struggles to suppress an ongoing swell of massive anti-government protests.Dozens of those protesters have reportedly been killed in recent weeks; Trump has threatened to take military action against Iran if the killings continue.The president has also explicitly encouraged the demonstrations against the Iranian regime. \"Iran is looking at FREEDOM, perhaps like never before. The USA stands ready to help!!!\" he wrote on social media on Saturday.The announcement of new tariffs on Iran's business partners also comes ahead of a much-anticipated Supreme Court ruling on whether many of Trump's most expansive tariffs are legal.Those tariffs — including his controversial \"reciprocal\" duties from early April and others related to purported fentanyl trafficking — were invoked using the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, or IEEPA. It was unclear if Trump's newly unveiled Iran-related tariffs also rest on that law. This is breaking news. Please refresh for updates.",

    "body": "For years, I introduced myself as a toy designer. But over time, I realized I wasn't designing toys — I was designing conditions for play: spaces and systems that invite experimentation, improvisation, and joy. Eventually, my audience shifted. Companies like Google, Nike, and Disney began calling, asking me to bring my approach to leadership teams.The question I hear most often: \"Do adults really need to play?\"The answer is yes. Play may be the single most overlooked skill that sets leaders apart, and it is necessary in times of uncertainty.Play isn't a distraction — it is the foundation of success and connectionWe're taught that adulthood is about control and productivity. Yet I've seen play unlock creativity, resilience, and connection. Leaders who play shift from obsessing over outcomes to embracing curiosity. They reframe failure as exploration, and they discover that a playful team fuels success. For example, at the Performance Theatre in London, I challenged CEOs, philanthropists, and government officials to \"create a way to live in a cloud.\" I gave them planks, wheels, and bolts with no instructions. I asked them to not build, but create. And this wasn't a presentation, either. This was an opportunity to tell a story.At first, the room was tense. People hesitated, unsure of how to play with something new without looking foolish. Five minutes in, jackets came off. Laughter erupted. Teams collaborated instead of competing. A \"cloud mole machine\" emerged. A flying robot came to life. By the end, participants were energized, open, and connected — not just to the task, but to each other.Give your yourself permission to play with 5 simple stepsPlay isn't just fun. It changes how we think, act, and lead. And you don't need a boardroom full of construction kits to start. Here are five ways to bring play into your life and leadership today:Revisit a childhood favorite. Think about games or activities you loved as a kid: building forts, drawing, exploring outside. Recreate a version of that today. The goal is to reconnect  with your own unique curiosity and imagination.Try \"object play\" at your desk. Let yourself tinker with whatever is around. Fold up sticky notes, rebend the paperclips, find something (not someone!) to shoot a rubber band at. Spend five minutes tinkering without a goal. Making things with your hands will shift your brain into problem-solving mode and sparks creativity in ways staring at a screen never will.Practice \"social play\" in meetings. Start with a lighthearted icebreaker or ask your team to brainstorm deliberately \"bad\" ideas before getting serious. Lowering the stakes encourages experimentation and helps teams become invested in each other's ideas.Embrace locomotor play. Stand up, stretch, or walk around during a call. Try dancing or just hopping around between meetings. Movement resets your energy and often sparks new ideas.Make room for (mis)behavior. Play can look silly or unproductive — that's the point. Sketch ridiculous inventions, stage a mini talent show, or build something with whatever's at hand. The goal isn't perfection; it's exploration.The science backs this up. Highly creative professionals often approach work playfully. If you want to lead well during uncertain times, innovate boldly, live fully, bring play back. Success isn't just metrics. It's how alive you feel while building, making, solving, and connecting.

    "body": "JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon has a \"little management lesson\" for professionals when it comes to conducting meetings: Give everyone your full attention.\"If you have an iPad in front of me and it looks like you're reading your email or getting notifications, I'll tell you to close the damn thing,\" he said on Oct. 14 at Fortune's Most Powerful Women Summit, where he also discussed mentoring female leaders. \"It's disrespectful.\"Appropriate meeting etiquette — like preparing beforehand and practicing active listening — signals that you care about the task at hand, and that you're passionate about your work, said Dimon, 69.\"When I go to a meeting, I've done the pre-reads, and you get 100% of my attention,\" he said. \"None of this nodding off, none of this reading my [email] ... And when I can't do that, I should move on.\"Dimon, who called for \"more hustle\" from his employees while implementing a five-day-in-office policy in March, shared more of his meeting do's and don'ts in an April 2024 letter to shareholders.\"When [meetings] happen, they have to start on time and end on time — and someone's got to lead them,\" Dimon wrote. \"There should also be a purpose to every meeting and always a follow-up list.\" He added that checking your phones and tablets \"has to stop: It's disrespectful. It wastes time.\"DON'T MISS: The ultimate guide to using AI to communicate betterTaking notes or recording a meeting with your tablet or smartphone could be misinterpreted as texting or scrolling. And if a notification pops up, it could easily distract you, which can leave a bad impression. That's why it's important to focus in meetings and listen carefully and intently, Harvard Business School associate professor Allison Wood Brooks told CNBC Make It in July.But simply listening isn't enough, Wood Brooks added: Ask follow-up questions, particularly ones that show you've been paying attention by referencing information or perspectives previously shared in the meeting.\"Probing for more information is a superhero move, and a shockingly low number of people think to do it,\" said Wood Brooks. \"You should show [you're listening] by saying [you are] out loud.\"  If you take notes, try using a pen and paper, a method that can help you better comprehend information, leadership and writing expert Katie McCleary said in a March 2023 TED Talk.When writing digitally, you try to \"capture all the information coming at you. And eventually, you can't capture it all and that device starts to whisper to you, 'Hey, maybe we should multitask. Maybe we could check social media for a minute. Maybe we should send another message,'\" said McCleary.\"Handwriting helps you focus,\" she said. \"We need stuff to stick.\"Want to level up your AI skills? Sign up for Smarter by CNBC Make It's new online course, How To Use AI To Communicate Better At Work.

    "body": "Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) President Sanae Takaichi stands up and bows to acknowledge the applause after she was selected as Japan's new prime minister during an extraordinary session of the lower house of parliament in Tokyo on October 21, 2025. Philip Fong | Afp | Getty ImagesSanae Takaichi on Tuesday created history, winning Japan's parliamentary vote to become the country's first woman prime minister.Takaichi garnered 237 votes in the first round of voting, negating the need for a runoff vote in the 465-seat Lower House, according to public broadcaster NHK.Her victory comes after the ruling Liberal Democratic Party allied with the Japan Innovation Party and reportedly signed an agreement over the weekend to form a coalition government. Takaichi agreed to back JIP policies such as a reduction in parliamentary seats, free high school education and a two-year pause on food consumption tax, according to Reuters.Tobias Harris, founder and principal at risk advisory firm Japan Foresight, told CNBC's \"Squawk Box Asia\" that the JIP might not want to take up a cabinet post, saying that \"there's a real risk joining a coalition with an LDP that is still seeing historically low approval ratings, [and] does not really have the trust of the public.\"Domestic Japanese media has also reported that the JIP is not looking at cabinet positions in the new administration, and will instead support the government from the outside.Should the JIP not like the LDP's approach, it will be easier for them to exit the coalition, Harris said.In the Ishiba administration, the LDP suffered heavy electoral losses, losing its majority in both the upper and the lower house.Japan's Nikkei 225, which had risen 1.5% earlier during the day, erased its gains, while the benchmark 10-year government bond yields dipped 1.6 basis points to 1.654%. The yen weakened 0.33% to 151.25.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconPath to PMTakaichi's path to the country's top job has been challenging.In the 2024 LDP presidential race, Takaichi lost to Shigeru Ishiba. She won the leadership of the party in September this year, defeating Agriculture Minister Shinjiro Koizumi after Ishiba announced his resignation.But on Oct. 10, the Komeito party abruptly exited its alliance with the LDP, ending a relationship going back to 1999, putting Takaichi's fate in a limbo.A hardline conservative, Takaichi has been widely labeled as an apostle of \"Abenomics,\" the economic strategy of the late Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, which espoused loose monetary policy, fiscal spending and structural reforms.She had previously criticized the Bank of Japan's plan to raise interest rates during the 2024 LDP leadership race, although BOJ Governor Kazuo Ueda has said that the central bank would set rates \"without any preconceptions.\"On the geopolitical front, Takaichi has called for a hardline stance toward China and is also in favor of revising Japan's pacifist constitution.Her previous visits to the controversial Yasukuni Shrine, which honors Japan's war dead, including convicted war criminals, have drawn criticism from China and South Korea, which see the site as a symbol of Tokyo's wartime aggression.Takaichi is going to be \"very, very careful\" in how she communicates her views, especially on foreign policy,\" said Kei Okamura, managing director and portfolio manager of Neuberger Berman, told CNBC earlier this month.\"Her views on China and Korea have also been very well flagged. But she also understands that she has to maintain very good relations with all these countries, especially also with the United States, just because all of them have a very big impact in terms of Japan's biggest export destinations.\"",

    "body": "watch nowWarner Bros. Discovery said Tuesday it's expanding its strategic review of the business and is open to a sale, sending shares of the company 10% higher in morning trading.Earlier this year, WBD announced plans to split into two separate entities, a streaming and studios business and a global networks business. It's also been fielding takeout interest from the newly merged Paramount Skydance.But on Tuesday, WBD said it's received \"unsolicited interest\" from multiple parties and will now review all options. The company said it's still moving toward the previously announced separation in the meantime.\"We continue to make important strides to position our business to succeed in today's evolving media landscape by advancing our strategic initiatives, returning our studios to industry leadership, and scaling HBO Max globally,\" CEO David Zaslav said in a statement. \"We took the bold step of preparing to separate the Company into two distinct, leading media companies, Warner Bros. and Discovery Global, because we strongly believed this was the best path forward.\"\"It's no surprise that the significant value of our portfolio is receiving increased recognition by others in the market. After receiving interest from multiple parties, we have initiated a comprehensive review of strategic alternatives to identify the best path forward to unlock the full value of our assets,\" he said.Netflix and Comcast are among the interested parties, sources told CNBC's David Faber.WBD decided to publicly announce it has had interest from multiple parties after rejecting several different bids from Paramount and an offer from another company that was higher than the Paramount bid, according to a person familiar with the matter.It is unclear how serious potential offers outside of Paramount would be. Netflix was not interested in buying legacy media assets, but didn't want WBD to go to another buyer at a low price, a source familiar with the matter said.While Comcast does not feel the need to do a deal, it will look at the possibility of pursuing WBD, sources close to the company told CNBC's Julia Boorstin.For any buyer that just wants WBD's studio and streaming assets, acquiring them after a split later this year is better for tax purposes.Paramount and WBD spokespeople declined to comment. Netflix and Comcast did not immediately respond to requests for comment.WBD has faced mounting financial challenges since the 2022 merger of WarnerMedia and Discovery Inc., which saddled the company with more than $40 billion in debt. It has since undertaken aggressive cost cutting, restructured its content pipeline and focused on profitable franchises like \"Harry Potter\" and \"Game of Thrones\" spinoffs.Though the company has made progress in debt reduction, investors have remained skeptical in part because of the company's cable network portfolio as consumers move toward streaming.Disclosure: Comcast is the parent company of NBCUniversal, which owns CNBC. Versant would become the new parent company of CNBC upon Comcast's planned spinoff of Versant.",

He is being held in lieu of a $10,000 cash bail.Moynihan, in August 2022, pleaded guilty to five misdemeanor counts and was convicted at a stipulated trial of one felony count in connection with his role in the Capitol riot by a mob of Trump supporters.He was sentenced in February 2023 to 21 months in prison and surrendered the following month. He was released after serving 12 months while he appealed his conviction of the felony count.Moynihan was one of about 1,500 people charged with Jan. 6-related crimes who were pardoned by Trump on his first day back in the White House on Jan. 20, 2025.\"I am grateful to state and federal law enforcement for their swift and decisive action to apprehend a dangerous individual who made a credible death threat against me with every intention to carry it out,\" said Jeffries, who represents a district in New York City, in a statement.Read more CNBC politics coverageX lawsuit vs. Apple and OpenAI stays in Fort Worth, Texas; judge suggests they move there'No Kings' protests against Trump bring a street party vibe to cities nationwideTrump commutes prison sentence of ex-GOP Rep.

    "body": "Annealed neodymium iron boron magnets sit in a barrel prior to being crushed into powder at Neo Material Technologies Inc.'s Magnequench Tianjin Co. factory in Tianjin, China, on Friday, June 11, 2010. Bloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesChina's exports of rare earth magnets to the U.S. fell sharply in September, ending months of recovery as the two economic superpowers remain locked in trade disputes and Washington pushes to secure alternative supply chains.Data from China's General Administration of Customs on Monday showed that U.S.-bound exports fell 28.7% in September from August to 420.5 tonnes. That figure was also nearly 30% lower than a year prior.It was the second consecutive monthly decline after a short-lived rebound that started in June, when Beijing had agreed to expedite rare earth export permits during trade talks with U.S. officials in London.Chinese rare earth magnet companies have reportedly been facing tighter scrutiny on export license applications starting in September. The customs figures also come from before Beijing expanded its export licensing regime earlier this month.China has a stranglehold on the production of rare-earth permanent magnets, with an estimated 90% of the market, and a similar dominance in refining the elements used to make them, according to the International Energy Agency. The magnets are vital for technologies such as electric vehicles, renewable energy, electronics and defense systems. Beijing's previous restrictions caused shortages and supply disruptions across industries earlier this year.China's export curbs have also extended beyond just the U.S., with total rare earth magnet shipments falling 6.1% in September from August, according to customs data. The disruptions have prompted the U.S. and its partners to accelerate efforts to build alternative rare earths and critical mineral supply chains. On Monday, the U.S. and Australia signed a minerals deal worth up to $8.5 billion. The agreement includes funding for multiple projects to boost supplies of rare earth and critical mineral materials used in defense manufacturing and energy security.The deal comes as U.S.-based Noveon Magnetics signed a memorandum of understanding with Australia's Lynas Rare Earths earlier this month to form a strategic partnership aimed at developing a scalable American supply chain for rare earth magnets.However, manufacturing rare earth magnets is highly complex and relies on upstream rare earth element mining and refining operations. Currently, only a handful of U.S. companies manufacture magnets domestically, with many in the early stages of production.",

Immediately after the news, Core Scientific's stock price fell, plummeting nearly 18%.The deal has received criticism with key proxy advisor Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) recommending on Monday that shareholders vote against the acquisition. Core Scientific's share price has conitnued to rise after the deal was announced which suggests some investors think that the company is valued higher than what CoreWeave has offered, ISS said.Intrator said that he was \"disappointed\" by the ISS report and continues to believe that the deal is \"in the long-term interest of Core Scientific shareholders.\" However, CoreWeave will not raise the price of the offer.\"We think that the bid that we put out there for [Core Scientific] is a fair representation of the relative value of the two companies as an all stock deal,\" Intrator told CNBC. \"We are going to just kind of proceed as we have, in the event that the transaction does not go through. It is a nice to have, not a need to have for us.\"\"Everything has a value, and the number we put out is the value we're willing to pay for them under all circumstances,\" Intrator added.watch nowEarlier this month Two Seas Capital, a major Core Scientific shareholder publicly opposed the acquisition saying that the price CoreWeave is offering is too low. Shareholders will vote on the deal on October 30.\"We see no reason why Core Scientific shareholders should accept such an underwhelming deal. Based on recent trading data, we see little evidence that they will,\" Two Seas Capital said in a Friday letter to shareholders.CoreWeave has aggressive pursued acqusitions this year to buy AI-related firms like OpenPipe, Weights & Biases, and Monolith as it looks to expand its product offering.The company, which has built data centers and offers Nvidia-powered computing power to hyperscalers like Microsoft, has been riding the wave of artificial intelligence investments.\"We've been in acquisitive mode as we continue to build and extend the functionality of our company,\" Intrator said.",

    "body": "Visitor passes the Raytheon Technologies Corporation logo at the 54th International Paris Air Show at Le Bourget Airport near Paris, France, on June 22, 2023.Benoit Tessier | ReutersDefense and aerospace giants raised their outlooks for the year on Tuesday, citing stronger demand despite economic uncertainty and tariffs.GE Aerospace, Northrop Grumman, RTX and Lockheed Martin each beat third-quarter Wall Street profit estimates, with only Northrop missing revenue estimates, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG.GE, which is both a defense supplier and a major engine maker for Boeing and Airbus commercial planes, raised its full-year adjusted revenue growth outlook from \"mid-teens\" to \"high-teens\" and its free cash flow forecast from a range of between $6.5 billion and $6.9 billion to a range of $7.1 billion to $7.3 billion.The company said quarterly defense deliveries were up 83% from last year and deliveries of its LEAP engines, used to power aircraft like the Boeing 737 Max and Airbus A321neo, hit a record, up 40% year over year.Its $11.31 billion in adjusted revenue for the third quarter topped Wall Street's $10.41 billion estimate. The company's stock is up more than 80% year to date.RTX shares were up about 9% in morning trading after the major defense contractor, whose businesses make products like commercial airplane cabin interiors and engines, raised its full-year adjusted earnings outlook from a range of $5.80 to $5.95 to a range of $6.10 to $6.20.It also hiked its adjusted sales guidance from a range of $84.75 billion to $85.5 billion to a range of $86.5 billion to $87 billion.The company cited its ability to weather the impact of tariffs and other macroeconomic uncertainty as positive signals for its growth. In July, the company estimated a $500 million hit related to tariff costs and slashed its guidance.On Tuesday, RTX posted positive growth in its aerospace and defense units, with a 12% rise in total revenue to $22.48 billion in the third quarter.\"We remain focused on executing on our $251 billion backlog and increasing our output to support the ramp across critical programs, while investing in next-generation products and services that meet the needs of our customers,\" CEO Chris Calio said in a statement.Northrop Grumman reported similar growth. The company posted earnings of $7.67 per share, well above the Wall Street estimate of $6.46 per share, according to LSEG. Northrop's sales increased 4% year over year, while sales within its defense systems division surged 14%.Though the company missed Wall Street's revenue estimate, it raised its guidance for full-year adjusted earnings per share by 65 cents to a range of $25.65 to $26.05.\"As a result of this performance and our positive outlook for the remainder of the year, we are once again increasing our 2025 EPS guidance,\" Northrop CEO Kathy Warden said in an earnings release. \"I am excited about our continued progress in responding with urgency to our customers' needs.\"Lockheed Martin, the final of the four stocks to report Tuesday morning, also beat analyst expectations for the quarter ended Sept. 30. The defense contractor reported earnings of $6.95 per share on revenues of $18.61 billion, beating Wall Street's estimates of $6.36 per share and $18.56 billion, respectively.CEO Jim Taiclet said the company is seeing \"unprecedented demand\" among customers both in the U.S. and across the world, leading Lockheed to increase its production capacity \"significantly\" across the company's various divisions.Lockheed boosted the low end of its full-year sales outlook and now expects revenue between $74.25 billion and $74.75 billion. It also hiked its earnings forecast from a range of $21.70 to $22 to a range of $22.15 to $22.35.\"We are investing aggressively in both new digital technologies and physical production capacity needed to meet the top defense priorities of the United States and its allies — and we are doing so in partnership with a number of leading technology partners, large and small,\" Taiclet said in a statement.He added that the U.S. Golden Dome project will be a major driver in growth as it begins construction. The project is estimated to cost roughly $175 billion, with an initial $25 billion already set aside in next year's defense funding package.The U.S. has increased its defense spending over the past year. For fiscal 2024, the Biden-Harris administration requested a budget of $842 billion for the Department of Defense, marking $100 billion more than fiscal year 2022 — though final allocations from Congress can differ from those figures.For 2025, the Biden-Harris administration requested a budget of $849.8 billion. The government's priorities for the budget included meeting the threat of countries like Russia, Iran and North Korea.",

    "body": "A General Motors Co. Chevrolet Silverado truck at a dealership in Upland, California, US, on Wednesday, Oct 15, 2025.Kyle Grillot | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesDETROIT — General Motors raised its 2025 financial guidance Tuesday after beating Wall Street's top- and bottom-line earnings expectations for the third quarter, while lowering its expected impact from tariffs.GM stock was up by more than 15% in trading Tuesday. The stock, which closed Monday at $58 per share, is on pace for its best day since 2020.Here's how the company performed in the third quarter, compared with average estimates compiled by LSEG:Earnings per share: $2.80 adjusted vs. $2.31 expectedRevenue: $48.59 billion vs. $45.27 billion expectedAdjusted EBIT: $3.38 billion vs. $2.72 billion expectedGM's third-quarter revenue of $48.59 billion was down less than 1% from $48.76 billion in the same period last year. Adjusted earnings exclude one-time or special items, some interest and taxes as well as other financials not considered \"core\" to the company's operations. GM's new outlook signals strength for the automaker heading into the fourth quarter and beats Wall Street analysts' current expectations for the last three months of the year.The updated guidance includes adjusted earnings before interest and taxes of between $12 billion and $13 billion, or $9.75 to $10.50 adjusted EPS, up from $10 billion to $12.5 billion, or $8.25 to $10 adjusted EPS, and adjusted automotive free cash flow of $10 billion to $11 billion, up from $7.5 billion to $10 billion.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconGM stock in 2025The automaker's new EPS target suggests fourth-quarter adjusted EPS of between $1.64 and $2.39, with a midpoint around $2.02, which is above current consensus of $1.94.\"Thanks to the collective efforts of our team, and our compelling vehicle portfolio, GM delivered another very good quarter of earnings and free cash flow,\" GM CEO Mary Barra said Tuesday in a shareholder letter. \"Based on our performance, we are raising our full-year guidance, underscoring our confidence in the company's trajectory.\"GM also reduced the expected impact of tariffs this year to between $3.5 billion and $4.5 billion, down from $4 billion to $5 billion. The automaker expects to offset about 35% of that impact.Barra on Tuesday thanked President Donald Trump for \"the important tariff updates\" Friday that included imposing levies on imported medium- and heavy-duty trucks and parts as well as extending a tariff offset worth 3.75% of the value of American-made vehicles.Read moreEV impactGM's adjusted results do not include $1.6 billion in special charges reported by the automaker last week due to its pullback in all-electric vehicles, which more than halved its net income attributable to stockholders compared with the third quarter of 2024.The company's net income attributable to stockholders was $1.3 billion during the just-reported period, down 57% from roughly $3.1 billion a year earlier. Its net income margin also plummeted to 2.7%, down from 6.3% a year earlier.GM CFO Paul Jacobson on Tuesday said only about 40% of the company's EVs were profitable on a production, or contribution-margin basis. He signaled that the company expects profitability for EVs to take longer than previously expected amid an expected slowdown in adoption.\"We continue to believe that there is a strong future for electric vehicles, and we've got a great portfolio to be competitive, but we do have some structural changes that we need to do to make sure that we lower the cost of producing those vehicles,\" he told CNBC's Phil LeBeau during \"Squawk Box.\"GM has made significant gains in EV sales this year. Motor Intelligence reported that the Detroit automaker went from an 8.7% market share to begin this year to 13.8% through the third quarter – topping Hyundai Motor, including Kia, at 8.6% through September. GM still trails U.S. EV leader Tesla by a wide margin.NA business downGM's North American business, which has driven its profits this decade, earned more than $2.5 billion during the third quarter, on an adjusted basis. Its adjusted profit margin declined from 9.7% a year earlier to 6.2% during the most recent quarter.Barra said in Tuesday's letter that the automaker's \"top priority\" is to return to 8% to 10% adjusted profit margins in North America through \"driving EV profitability, maintaining production and pricing discipline, managing fixed costs, and further reducing tariff exposure.\"Gains in the company's China operations, up $217 million from a year earlier, as well as its international markets, up $184 million, helped offset the lower North American earnings during the third quarter.GM Financial, the automaker's lending arm, also reported adjusted earnings of $804 million, up 17% from the third quarter of 2024.",

    "body": "FILE PHOTO: Former FBI Director James Comey testified in front of the Senate Intelligence Committee in the Senate Hart building on Capitol Hill, on Thursday, June 8, 2017.Cheriss May | Nurphoto | Getty ImagesFormer FBI Director James Comey on Monday asked a federal judge to dismiss his criminal case, arguing that he is being vindictively prosecuted because of President Donald Trump's animus toward him.Comey, in a pair of motions for dismissal filed in federal court in eastern Virginia, also argued that the indictment against him is fatally flawed because his prosecutor, interim U.S. Attorney Lindsey Halligan, was appointed unlawfully.Comey wants U.S. District Judge Michael Nachmanoff to dismiss the case \"with prejudice,\" meaning it cannot be refiled.\"Any lesser remedy would be insufficient in light of the government's flagrant misconduct and the need to deter the government from bringing further unconstitutional prosecutions,\" his lawyers wrote in one of the court motions.In the other filing, Comey's legal team argued that Halligan's actions should be nullified because she was \"defectively\" installed in violation of a federal law governing the appointment of interim U.S. attorneys by the attorney general.\"The United States cannot charge, maintain, and prosecute a case through an official who has no entitlement to exercise governmental authority,\" the lawyers wrote.Comey, a former Trump administration official who has long been seen as a political enemy by the president, was charged in late September with one count each of making a false statement and obstructing a congressional proceeding.The charges pertain to Comey's testimony before the Senate in September 2020. The indictment was returned less than a week before a five-year statute of limitations was set to expire.",

    "body": "In this photo illustration, Beyond Meat's Beyond Burgers are shown on February 29, 2024 in Chicago, Illinois.Scott Olson | Getty ImagesBeyond Meat has regained a bit of its meme mojo status, surging 47% on Tuesday.The food company known for its plant-based meat alternatives is having an incredible week, with shares surging more than 127% Monday in its best day ever after Roundhill Investments, which develops thematic ETFs, added the name to its Roundhill Meme Stock ETF (MEME).It continued that rally Tuesday after Beyond Meat announced a deal with Walmart to expand distribution to more stores across the U.S.It appears the ETF addition has unleashed a short squeeze with investors who bet against the stock forced to cover their position. More than 63% of the shares available for trading were sold short, per FactSet.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconBeyond Meat, 1-day performanceIt's a remarkable turnaround for a stock that tumbled more than 67% just last week, after the company announced it has finalized a debt deal. The stock is currently trading around $2 per share, after ending last week at just 65 cents.Indeed, the stock has been under pressure for many years, posting losing returns over each of the last five years. After surging past $230 per share following its IPO in 2019, it has since become a penny stock.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconBYND, all timeYet this week's rally harkens back to when Beyond Meat enjoyed meme stock status among retail traders, who crowded into the stock based more on sentiment than on corporate fundamentals after coordinating on online message boards.In 2021, Bank of America called Beyond Meat a Reddit stock to watch. It ended that same year down more than 47%.watch nowThe return of Beyond Meat could also be the latest sign of a frothy market, as investors pile into more speculative names in spite of elevated valuations, and possibly a signal of a market top.Roundhill actually shut its meme ETF down at one point because of lack of interest, but revived it earlier this month as retail traders dive back into this relentless bull market.",

    "body": "watch nowPresident Donald Trump's presidency has been uniquely good for businesses, according to Bill Ackman, CEO of Pershing Square Capital Management.\"I think Trump has been the most pro-business president we've ever had,\" Ackman said Tuesday morning on CNBC's \"Squawk Box.\"Ackman pointed to infrastructure and tax bills as having positive effects for businesses. He also noted that the Federal Reserve is \"accommodative\" of interest rate cuts.Ackman acknowledged that he was \"a little bit concerned\" by Trump's market-roiling tariff policy first unveiled in April. However, Ackman credited Trump for changing his position after the billionaire investor suggested taking a pause before implementing the policy.\"I trust the president,\" said Ackman, who has been a public supporter of Trump. \"I think he's done an excellent job.\"While the market initially sold-off after Trump shared his plan for broad and steep levies, the S&P 500 has surged around 19% since the early April announcement. The benchmark index is on track to finish 2025 almost 15% higher. That would mark its third straight annual gain.Investors have long expected Trump would benefit companies given his emphasis on deregulation. Stocks shot up following his victory in November of last year.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconS&P 500 in 2025Ackman said geopolitical risk for the market has been declining. Still, he said he wished the U.S. and China had a \"better relationship.\"Ackman's comments come as the U.S. and China have faced off over rare earth minerals in recent weeks.Trump hiked tariffs this month after China tightened export restrictions on the materials and has pushed for a supply chain that's independent of the Asian country. He signed an agreement with Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese on Monday focused on rare earths.On the other hand, Ackman called for chief executives of New York City-based companies to encourage their workers to vote in the mayoral election early next month. Ackman has criticized Zohran Mamdani, the Democratic nominee for mayor whose surprise victory in the primary has unsettled Wall Street.Ackman said Mamdani is \"accurate in identifying the problems with the city,\" pointing specifically to his focus on affordability and public safety. But Ackman said the Democrat has the \"wrong\" policies for solving these challenges.\"We do not want a socialist leading the most important financial city in the country,\" Ackman said in reference to Mamdani.watch now",

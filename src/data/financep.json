    "body": "Chinese officials are reviewing Meta's $2 billion acquisition of AI startup Manus for possible technology control violations, FT reported on Tuesday.Sopa Images | Lightrocket | Getty ImagesMeta Platforms is set to test new subscription models across its apps, including Instagram, Facebook and WhatsApp in the coming months, according to a report from TechCrunch on Tuesday. The report, confirmed by a Meta spokesperson, said the subscriptions are expected to \"unlock more productivity and creativity\" by giving paid users access to more features and expanded AI capabilities. Meta's recently acquired suite of general AI agents under Manus will also be scaled as part of the subscription plans. Meta Platforms bought Manus — a Singapore-based developer of AI agents founded in China — in December for a reported $2 billion.With its new subscription plans, Meta could be seeking a return on investment from its massive spending on AI talent and acquisitions last year, even before the Manus purchase. While Meta has been developing large language models under the Llama umbrella, those have been open-sourced. That means general access to Llama has remained free, unlike with paid plans from AI leaders like OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic.Other features offered as part of Meta's paid plans could include full access to its AI-powered short-form video experience Vibes, which allows users to create and remix AI-generated videos. While Vibes has been free since its launch in 2025, the new subscription model would grant free access to its basic version, with the option to pay for additional features. The subscriptions will be separate from Meta Verified, a paid product rolled out by the company in 2023 that gave content creators and businesses a verified badge, 24/7 direct support, protection against impersonation, search optimization, and more.Meta told TechCrunch that it plans to listen to its user community and gather feedback as it rolls out subscriptions in the coming months.",

Nurphoto | Nurphoto | Getty ImagesSouth Korea's ruling Democratic Party said it would pass a special act on the U.S. trade deal by end- February, according to Yonhap, after U.S. President Donald Trump threatened higher tariffs on South Korean exports. Earlier on Tuesday, Trump said he was raising tariffs on South Korean exports to 25% from the current 15%, citing a delay in the country's parliament approving the Washington-Seoul trade deal agreed in July last year. Spokesperson of the ruling Democratic Party Kim Hyun-jung said Trump was likely referring to the Special Act on Strategic Investment Management between Korea and the United States, according to a Google translation of the statement in Korean, submitted to the country's parliament last November.The bill aims to establish a state-run investment corporation to manage Seoul's planned $350 billion investment pledge to Washington. Kim said that five related bills have been submitted to the National Assembly, and are scheduled to be reviewed, adding that \"the fact that both the Democratic Party of Korea and the People Power Party have proposed these bills will likely expedite their passage.\"The ruling DP currently holds 162 seats in the 300 seat National Assembly with four vacant seats, while the PPP holds 107.  \"What is needed now is to quickly confirm the intent and facts of the U.S statement and correct any misunderstandings,\" she said. South Korea's presidential office said that it had called a meeting to review and discuss responses to Trump's announcement on Tuesday, and reiterated its commitment to implementing the tariff agreement. Earlier in the day, the office said it had not received any official notice or explanation from the U.S. regarding the announcement, according to local media outlet Yonhap. South Korea's finance ministry said that it will keep the U.S. informed on the legislative process, while Seoul's trade ministry said that industry minister Kim Jung-kwan will visit Washington for talks on the matter, Yonhap reported.\"It is time for the government and the ruling and opposition parties in the National Assembly to join forces. I look forward to the People Power Party's bipartisan cooperation,\" Kim said.South Korean automakers Hyundai and Kia plunged in early trade following Trump's threats, but later pared losses. Hyundai last traded 0.1% down, and Kia was down 1.16%. The broader Kospi was up 1.9%, while the small-cap Kosdaq index climbed 0.89%. Stock Chart IconStock chart icon",

    "body": "The TikTok logo is displayed at a TikTok office on Jan. 23, 2026 in Culver City, California. Mario Tama | Getty ImagesTikTok's U.S. app, now under majority American ownership, said a recent wave of glitches and content disruption was due to a power outage at one of its data centers, pushing back against claims that the platform was censoring political speech.Users have reported issues with their accounts since the video-sharing app began operating under a newly-formed U.S.-led joint venture, following months of political pressure over its Chinese ownership.Against the backdrop of a tense political environment in the U.S., a growing number of viral complaints about TikTok have accused the platform of censoring certain political positions and even the word \"Epstein\" within direct messaging. CNBC confirmed that messages containing the word \"Epstein\" triggered an error message, but was unable to independently verify broader claims of political censorship.Asked about the issues, a spokesperson for the TikTok joint venture told CNBC that the platform does not prohibit sharing the name 'Epstein' in messages and that it is investigating why some users are experiencing the problem, among others.The sensitivity surrounding the messaging issue relates to Jeffrey Epstein, the late financier and convicted sex offender.  The Department of Justice has, since December, been releasing caches of documents tied to its investigations of Epstein, but has yet to release the entirety of the so-called \"Epstein files.\" California scrutinyThe recent complaints about TikTok have been amplified by California Gov. Gavin Newsom, whose press office said in a Tuesday post on X that \"our office has received reports — and independently confirmed instances — of suppressed content critical of President Trump.\"\"[Gavin] Newsom is launching a review of this conduct and is calling on the California Department of Justice to determine whether it violates California law,\" it added. Newsom's office didn't provide evidence to support the claims, though many users have posted videos allegedly showing the issue. In a viral X post, freelance journalist David Leavitt shared a screenshot of videos on his profile that had been flagged as \"Ineligible for Recommendation,\" and claimed TikTok had begun censoring anti-Trump and anti-ICE content.ICE refers to the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency, which is currently engaged in a politically charged operation in the city of Minneapolis. The fatal shootings of two U.S. citizens during federal enforcement actions by ICE have sparked outrage and political debate.Just hours before Newsom issued his threat, the new TikTok joint venture posted an update on its X account saying the company was \"continuing to resolve\" its major infrastructure issue. \"While the network has been recovered, the outage caused a cascading systems failure that we've been working to resolve with our data center partner,\" it said, adding that users may notice multiple bugs, slower load times, and timed-out requests when posting new content. The company also said creators might temporarily see \"0\" views or likes on videos due to server timeouts. When asked directly about recent accusations of censorship, including claims related to content about ICE, a TikTok USDS Joint Venture spokesperson said that videos of the incident in Minnesota were available on the platform and had been since Saturday.Separately, users reported this week that direct messages containing the name \"Epstein\" failed to send through TikTok's direct messaging feature. CNBC was able to recreate this error message when sending a message containing the name \"Epstein.\" That message read: \"This message may be in violation of our Community Guidelines, and has not been sent to protect our community.\" Users were given the option to report potential mistakes. Ownership overhaulTikTok had faced a potential shutdown in the U.S. last year after the Supreme Court upheld a law requiring it to exit the market unless its China-based parent company, ByteDance, divested the business, among other national security-related requirements. Trump later issued a series of executive orders allowing the platform to remain online while negotiations over a divestment continued.Last Thursday, TikTok announced it had formed a joint venture to keep the app operating in the U.S. under new leadership. Under the deal, ByteDance retains a 19.9% ownership stake, while U.S. and global investors hold 80.1%. Key investors include Oracle, Silver Lake, and MGX, each with a 15% stake. Oracle's co-founder Larry Ellison, a prominent Trump supporter, was previously floated by the U.S. President as a potential TikTok buyer as far back as January last year. The Trump administration and a Trump-backed crypto firm have previously been involved in deals with MGX, an Emirati state-owned investment firm focused on artificial intelligence technologies. — CNBC's Matthew Chin contributed to this report ",

    "body": "UnitedHealth Group Inc. signage on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York, US, on Wednesday, Dec. 31, 2025. Michael Nagle | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesUnitedHealth Group on Tuesday posted a modest fourth-quarter earnings beat, but issued soft revenue guidance, as the parent company of the nation's largest private insurer works to turn itself around amid higher-than-expected medical costs. Here's what the company reported for the fourth quarter compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:Earnings per share: $2.11 adjusted vs. $2.10 expectedRevenue: $113.2 billion vs. $113.82 billion expectedThe results come two days after UnitedHealth CEO Stephen Hemsley and other chief executives of Minnesota's largest businesses banded together to sign an open letter calling for an \"immediate deescalation of tensions\" in the state after federal immigration agents fatally shot U.S. citizen Alex Pretti, a 37-year-old ICU nurse. UnitedHealth is banking on a new leadership team to carry out a turnaround plan. The strategy involves shrinking membership, raising prices, cutting benefits and increasing transparency to restore profitability — along with the company's reputation — after a series of hurdles over the last two years. UnitedHealth expects 2026 revenue to exceed $439 billion, a 2% year-over-year decline that reflects \"right-sizing across the enterprise,\" the company said in a release. That comes far below the $454.6 billion in sales that analysts were expecting for the year. \"It's the first time in a decade that UnitedHealth Group has had declining revenue,\" CFO Wayne DeVeydt said in an interview, referring to the sales guidance. He pointed to three factors driving the expected decline, including the company's divestitures in the fourth quarter and others set for later this year, such as its operations in the U.K. and South America. He also pointed to a \"fairly sizable\" overall U.S. membership decline of more than 3 million in 2026. \"I would say that in the fourth quarter, we righted the ship in the sense that we removed through the fraction, obviously, South America, European operations,\" he said. \"We are focusing on American domestic businesses and we have essentially strengthened the balance sheet and repositioned the company for the historical growth that investors have seen.\"The third factor is that 2026 is the final year of the transition to Medicare's new coding system – known as V28 – which has reduced payments to insurers by changing how patient diagnoses are weighted, DeVeydt said. That will translate to a $6 billion revenue hit, $2 billion of which will impact the company's insurer, UnitedHealthcare, with the rest hitting its Optum health-care unit, he noted. On Monday, shares of UnitedHealth and other health insurers plunged after the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services proposed nearly flat payment rates for insurers in Medicare Advantage, the privately run insurance program that now covers more than half of all Medicare beneficiaries.That closely watched government payment rate determines how much insurers can charge for monthly premiums and plan benefits they offer — and ultimately helps to shape their profits. Medical costs from Medicare Advantage patients have spiked over the last two years as more older adults return to hospitals to undergo procedures they had delayed during the pandemic, such as joint and hip replacements. In the fourth quarter, those medical costs were \"still elevated and high but not growing beyond expectations,\" DeVeydt said. For 2026, UnitedHealth expects its insurance segment's medical benefit ratio — a measure of total medical expenses paid relative to premiums collected — to come in at 88.8%, plus or minus 50 basis points. That would be an improvement from the 89.1% ratio reported for 2025. A lower ratio typically indicates that the company collected more in premiums than it paid out in benefits, resulting in higher profitability.",

    "body": "Cheng Xin | Getty ImagesTikTok users have been deleting the app at a higher rate since the company announced that its U.S. operations would be housed in a new joint venture.The daily average of U.S. users deleting the TikTok app has increased nearly 150% over the past five days compared with the previous three months, market intelligence firm Sensor Tower told CNBC.Last Thursday, TikTok said it had formed a joint venture to keep the video-sharing app operating in the U.S. under new American leadership. The company named Adam Presser, formerly TikTok's head of operations, as CEO of the joint venture. Some users took to social media to voice their skepticism about the new joint venture after being prompted to agree to an updated privacy policy on Thursday.Several social media posts pointed to language in the new policy that describes the types of data TikTok may collect, including sensitive information such as \"your racial or ethnic origin\" as well as \"sexual life or sexual orientation, status as transgender or nonbinary, citizenship or immigration status, or financial information.\"Despite the social media uproar, that language does not appear to be new. An archived version of the policy from August 2024 includes the same provisions.Those concerns appear to have weighed on sentiment around the app after the announcement of the joint venture, contributing to a spike in uninstalls over the past several days.watch now\"If I can delete my biggest platform because their terms of agreement and censorship have gotten out of control, so can you!\" creator Dre Ronayne posted on Threads, the micro-blogging service owned by Meta. Ronayne said she had nearly 400,000 followers on TikTok before deleting her account on Sunday.Other creators have also reported problems posting to the app, with users complaining about outages and video uploads failing to go through.The social media company hasn't communicated to its creators what the joint venture means for them, Nadya Okamoto, a TikTok creator with over 4 million followers, told CNBC. \"That's why there is so much paranoia, because we're all kind of looking at this platform and we just don't know what's happening,\" she said. Okamoto told CNBC she has experienced issues with the app over the past several days and has been unable to upload videos for roughly 24 hours. During the uncertainty, she is continuing to post her content on Instagram and Google's YouTube.\"Online there's a lot of conversation about — is this all coincidence or censorship, and what does this look like?\" Okamoto said. \"For everything to be happening at once, it is very scary.\"An X account associated with the TikTok joint venture said on Monday that the services issue was caused by a power outage at a U.S. data center.\"We're working with our data center partner to stabilize our service. We're sorry for this disruption and hope to resolve it soon,\" the account wrote.However, the increase in uninstalls has not translated into a meaningful drop in U.S. usage. TikTok's active user levels in the U.S. have remained relatively flat compared with the previous week, according to Sensor Tower.Competing apps, however, have seen a bump in interest. Sensor Tower data shows U.S. downloads for UpScrolled increased more than tenfold compared with the prior week, while Skylight Social rose 919% and Chinese-owned Rednote climbed 53% week over week.TikTok did not respond to request for comment.",

The company added the cuts are part of Nike's goal to get back to \"long-term, profitable growth\" and improve margins.As the use of AI and automation sweeps across corporate America, distribution center jobs are expected to take a hit. Last year, UPS announced plans to cut 48,000 roles — in part because of more automation at its facilities. It's unclear how exactly Nike plans to expand automation at its distribution centers and how much of a role that's playing in its 775 job cuts.The layoffs come as CEO Elliott Hill works to turn around Nike following years of slowing sales and shrinking margins. The struggles came after former top executive John Donahoe pursued a direct selling strategy that prioritized the retailer's stores and websites over wholesale partners. watch nowAs part of that strategy, Nike's distribution centers — and staff within those facilities — ballooned, but they don't have the volume to support those staffing levels, the people familiar with the matter said. Under Hill, Nike has been working to woo back wholesale partners, clean out stale inventory and reignite innovation. When reporting earnings for the fiscal second quarter in December, Nike said its net income had fallen 32% as it contended with tariffs, costs associated with its turnaround and a slowdown in its key China market. ",

    "body": "The Microsoft data center campus, currently under construction, is reflected in Mount Pleasant, Wisconsin, September 18, 2025.Audrey Richardson | ReutersLocal officials have signed off on Microsoft's plans to build 15 more data centers in Mount Pleasant, Wisconsin, near an existing site that the technology company is expanding. Additional data center capacity will allow Microsoft to recognize revenue that it has booked from OpenAI and other clients. Amazon, Google and Oracle are racing Microsoft to build data centers filled with Nvidia chips that can train and run generative artificial intelligence models. Finding sites for these facilities can be challenging because utilities don't always have the necessary energy available. And increasingly, people who live near prospective data center sites are mounting opposition campaigns.Mount Pleasant homeowners and officials have generally welcomed Microsoft's expansion in the village.In 2017, device manufacturer Foxconn announced plans to build a $10 billion plant that would create 13,000 jobs in an initiative trumpeted by President Donald Trump. The village made room, buying up land. State tax dollars went toward infrastructure improvements. But Foxconn didn't exactly follow through. By 2023, the company employed 1,000 people across the state, and the village owed over $250 million.In the adjacent village of Caledonia, many residents spoke out against Microsoft's request to rezone land for a data center, and in September the company decided to stop pursuing that location.The new work in Mount Pleasant is divided into two lots just northwest of Microsoft's current site. For the larger of the two lots, Microsoft bought the land from the village and from private owners in 2023 and 2024. The two sets of plans call for almost 9 million square feet of building area, with three proposed substations, according to documents on file with the village.Together, the taxable value of the proposed developments exceeds $13 billion, according to the paperwork.Mount Pleasant's village board on Monday unanimously approved the two sets of plans. During a public comment period, six people expressed support for Microsoft's plans, and three people raised concerns. One of the opponents said jobs working on the data centers won't be permanent. David DeGroot, Mount Pleasant's village board president, objected to that characterization.\"I'm addressing this to all of the union folks that are here,\" DeGroot said. \"When I heard that these jobs are temporary from somebody, if I was you, I would take umbrage to that, because it's my understanding that you are going to be out there on those sites for the next 10 years, doing your jobs, plying your trade, and I don't see anything temporary in 10 years.\"On Wednesday, the village planning commission approved site plans that factor in changes staff members had proposed. The 15 new data centers would not require more water than the 8.4 million gallons it's expected to receive annually from the nearby city of Racine, Samuel Schultz, Mount Pleasant's community development director, told the planning commission.Microsoft can now submit final civil engineering plans and file building permits.

    "body": "The Tencent logo is displayed on the exterior of a building at the company’s headquarters, with a surveillance camera visible in the foreground, on November 30, 2024, in Shenzhen, Guangdong Province, China. Cheng Xin | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesTencent plans to expand its data center footprint in the Middle East, a top executive at the Chinese tech giant told CNBC, as the company looks to boost its cloud computing business outside China. Dowson Tong, CEO of Tencent's cloud group, told CNBC that the company plans to expand the number of \"availability zones,\" locations designated as sites for potential clusters of data centers, for its cloud services over the next 12 to 18 months, in countries across Asia Pacific, Europe, and the Middle East.In the Middle East, Tencent is \"actively\" exploring building data centers there to service cloud customers, Dowson added.\"We do intend to increase our investment in the region and establish a stronger partnership network. And that's all in the plan,\" he said, declining to give more specific timelines or countries where exactly the availability zones might be.Tencent's planned expansion in the Middle East comes as countries in the region draw in huge investments from tech giants to build AI data centers and other computing infrastructure. Last year, Nvidia, OpenAI and others committed to building a massive AI infrastructure project under the Stargate brand in the United Arab Emirates. watch nowIn August, analysts at Gartner forecast information technology spending in the Middle East and North Africa region to hit $155 billion in 2025, up nearly 9% year-on-year and above the global growth rate.Tencent has already opened an availability zone in Saudi Arabia. Further expansion in the Middle East will likely put it into more direct competition with U.S. giants, including Amazon, Microsoft and Google.Dowson said Tencent already has customers in Saudi Arabia buying its cloud services, such as Keeta, the international food delivery subsidiary of Chinese giant Meituan. Tencent, which is one of the world's largest gaming companies, has gaming firms in the region also using its Saudi-based cloud services, Dowson added.While most of Tencent's revenue still comes from gaming, the company has sought to diversify its business by expanding other areas, including cloud computing.Tencent is hoping to differentiate itself from U.S. rivals by using its strong customer base in China to expand internationally. For example, customers who use Tencent's cloud in China may also buy the company's services abroad.The Middle East is becoming a key area of expansion for Chinese firms.Lenovo, the world's biggest PC company, has set up its regional headquarters in Saudi Arabia and is currently building a manufacturing plant there.\"I think there's so much initiative and investment going into ... the Middle East. So I think we're very excited about the opportunity there,\" Winston Cheng, CFO of Lenovo, told CNBC in an interview last week. ",

    "body": "A Boeing Co. 737 Max airplane at the company's manufacturing facility in Renton, Washington, US, on Thursday, Nov. 20, 2025. David Ryder | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesBoeing reported revenue ahead of Wall Street expectations for the fourth quarter as the company's turnaround picked up steam following years of crises.The company's airplane deliveries last year were the highest since 2018, helping drive revenue. Boeing brought in $23.9 billion in the last three months of 2025, a 57% increase over the same period in 2024 and topping analysts' expectations. Cash flow of $400 million was roughly double what Wall Street was expecting.CEO Kelly Ortberg told staff that the company is making progress and that there's \"a lot to be optimistic about\" in 2026.\"At the same time, with progress comes expectations, and our customers and stakeholders are going to expect more from us this year,\" he said.Here's how Wall Street expects Boeing performed in the fourth quarter, according to analysts' estimates compiled by LSEG:Earnings per share: $9.92 adjusted Revenue: $23.95 billion vs. $22.6 billion expectedThe company's reported earnings per share of $9.92 included the impact of the sale of its Jeppesen aircraft navigation unit.Boeing still has a long road ahead to deliver delayed aircraft — some of which haven't yet won regulator approval — to customers around the world. Boeing delivered 600 airplanes to customers last year, nearly double the number from 2024 and the most since 2018. Ortberg, who came out of retirement to run the manufacturer in 2024, and other executives have said more production increases are on the horizon in the coming months.Deliveries are key for aircraft manufacturers because customers pay the bulk of an aircraft's price when they receive it.For Boeing, it's a crucial ramp up after the company has burned through roughly $40 billion since the first quarter of 2019 — when the second of two fatal crashes of the best-selling 737 Max plunged it into crisis for years — through the third quarter of 2025. The Covid-19 pandemic, residual supply chain and labor shortages and a host of production problems have continued to hamstring the company, the largest U.S. exporter by value.Boeing handed over 63 jetliners to customers last month, and 44 of those deliveries were 737 Maxes, the manufacturer said earlier this month.Airbus still delivered more aircraft last year than Boeing, with 793, though that total is below the record 863 airplanes the European manufacturer handed over in 2019.But Boeing outsold Airbus with 1,173 net orders in 2025 over its European competitor's 889 net orders for the year. Airlines are starting to look out to the 2030s, securing delivery slots as they chart growth and replace older, more fuel-thirsty planes. Boeing counts Alaska Airlines and Delta Air Lines as customers in recent weeks for deliveries into the next decade.Boeing is far from out of the woods, though. Investors will be eager to hear from the company's leadership about what delivery pace is most realistic this year. The manufacturer still needs the Federal Aviation Administration's approval for further Max increases beyond 42 per month, a requirement the regulator instated after a near-catastrophic midair blowout of a panel in January 2024.Investors are likely to seek a firmer timeline for long-delayed 737 Max 7 and Max 10 certification as well as the twin-engine 777X, which will become the largest wide-body in its lineup. They are also looking for an update on Boeing's defense business, where delays have included the two 747s that will serve as the next Air Force One aircraft.Boeing executives will host an earnings conference call at 10:30 a.m. ET.This is developing news.

    "body": "NINGBO, CHINA - JANUARY 22: Employees work on the production line of snowboards at a workshop to meet the orders on January 22, 2026 in Ningbo, Zhejiang Province of China. He Yuankai/Zhejiang Daily Press Group | Visual China Group | Getty ImagesChina's industrial profits rose 0.6% in 2025 from a year earlier, snapping three consecutive years of declines as officials moved to rein in aggressive price competition and companies sought overseas growth amid weak domestic demand.The pace of growth accelerated from 0.1% in the January-to-November period, according to data from the National Bureau of Statistics.The recovery last year was driven by policy intervention, particularly Beijing's campaign against aggressive price undercutting, and companies' efforts to expand overseas, said Tianchen Xu, a senior economist at the Economist Intelligence Unit.  Industrial profits climbed 5.3% in December from a year earlier, the strongest performance since September when earnings surged 21.6%. Profits had faltered in the prior two months, falling 5.5% in October and 13.1% in November.  In December, China's factory activity returned to growth after eight straight months of contraction, in part thanks to pre-holiday stockpiling ahead of the Lunar New Year in February, an official at the statistics bureau said. Profits at the country's major industrial firms have been battered by the bruising price wars sweeping across several industries last year as sluggish consumer demands left companies grappling with excess capacity. Uneven growth across sectorsThere is a \"high level of divergence\" across industries, said Lynn Song, chief Greater China economist at ING, adding that the overall profits growth remains tepid as price competition continues to erode margins. watch nowFor the entire 2025, mining sector profits plunged 26.2% from a year earlier, while profits in manufacturing and utilities, including electricity, heat, fuel and water, rose 5% and 9.4%, respectively, official data showed. Among sectors that posted outsized gains, ferrous metal smelting and rolling processing firms saw profits surge 22.6%, while electronics manufacturing rose 19.5%. Coal mining and washing industry profits fell 41.8% and oil and gas extraction dropped 18.7%.      Profits at state-owned enterprises declined 3.9% while foreign-funded businesses, including those with investment from Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan, recorded a 4.2% increase. Yu Weining, chief statistician at NBS, attributed the modest rebound last year to the new growth drivers such as equipment and high-tech manufacturing. Railway, shipbuilding, aerospace, and electronics industries posted double-digit profit growth, Yu said.Smart consumer electronics makers saw profits jump 48%, with unmanned aerial devices manufacturing and intelligent in-car appliance makers reporting gains of 102% and 88.8%, respectively. Yu, however, acknowledged that some industrial firms are still facing operational challenges, noting that \"changes in the external environment\" are increasingly important to profitability. \"Progress in Beijing's 'anti-involution' push could gradually improve things, but it will take time,\" ING's Song said, referring to regulatory efforts launched last year to curb aggressive price cuts that have fueled excessive competition and deflationary pressure.Beijing has taken some comfort from the headline economic growth last year that met the official target of 5%, helped by strong export growth as a one-year U.S.-China trade truce kept higher tariffs at bay. Economists, however, called for further policy support to bolster domestic demand and broad economic growth. Retail sales grew 3.7% in 2025 from a year earlier, lagging behind the overall economic growth and a 5.9% expansion in industrial output. At a press briefing on Monday, Yang Mu, an official at the Chinese Commerce Ministry, said Beijing will step up efforts to boost household spending on cars, home appliances, and electronic goods, while targeting consumption in the services sector.

And now a new catalyst, which is this ordered world we lived in seems to be becoming less ordered, and that obviously has an impact on ... the monetary markets, and gold is playing its role in that.\"Central banks in countries such as China are also rethinking their allocations to U.S. Treasurys and buying more gold, he noted. And with minimal supply growth each year and new mines taking at least a decade to build, Al-Joundi said he expects gold supply to remain tight. \"You're not going to see gold flooding the market,\" Al-Joundi said.Perhaps surprisingly, Al-Joundi sees another tailwind coming from crypto. Bitcoin's popularity, Al-Joundi argued, has introduced a younger generation to the idea of owning a hedge against unstable fiat currencies. Now, some of those same investors are realizing they can buy gold for the same reasons they once bought bitcoin, which he called \"a positive force for gold.\" Over the past 12 months, the price of bitcoin has fallen nearly 16%. It's up a little over 1% year to date. For Agnico Eagle, one of the world's largest gold companies, the gold rally has already delivered record financial results, and its share price more than doubled last year and has risen another 27% so far in 2026. watch now",

    "body": "The White House on Monday appeared to soften its rhetoric surrounding the recent killing of ICU nurse Alex Pretti by federal agents in Minneapolis, after its initial response spurred widespread calls to de-escalate ongoing federal deportation efforts in Minnesota.\"Nobody in the White House, including President [Donald] Trump, wants to see people getting hurt or killed in America's streets,\" press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters during a briefing.That includes Pretti and Renee Nicole Good — another U.S. citizen who was fatally shot by federal agents in Minneapolis — \"and the brave men and women of federal law enforcement and the many Americans who have been victimized at the hands of illegal alien criminals,\" Leavitt said.Trump \"does not want any Americans to lose their lives in the streets of America,\" Leavitt later added.The statement from the White House, which signaled sympathy for the two people killed during chaotic altercations with immigration officers, contrasted sharply with how some administration officials first reacted to the shootings.Stephen Miller, Trump's homeland security adviser, had called Pretti a \"domestic terrorist\" and accused him of being an \"assassin.\"Greg Bovino, Border Patrol commander at large, claimed Pretti may have been intending to \"massacre law enforcement.\"Multiple media outlets, including the Associated Press, reported Monday citing sources that Border Patrol commander Bovino and some agents are expected to leave Minneapolis by Tuesday.Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, shortly after Pretti's killing, claimed he had been \"brandishing\" a weapon and that he had reacted \"violently\" to officers' attempts to disarm him. Later analyses from multiple news outlets found many of those claims were contradicted by the available video evidence.Leavitt, asked Monday about Miller's comments, said, \"I have not heard the president characterize Mr. Pretti in that way.\"Leavitt's comments came one day after Trump, in an interview with The Wall Street Journal, would not  directly say if he believed shooting Pretti was the right thing to do.\"We're looking, we're reviewing everything and will come out with a determination,\" Trump told the newspaper.Earlier Monday, Trump announced on Truth Social that border czar Tom Homan will head to Minnesota on Monday night to manage U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement's on-the-ground operations there.\"Tom is tough but fair, and will report directly to me,\" Trump wrote.Leavitt said in a separate social media post that Homan will coordinate with officials leading ongoing investigations into fraud schemes in Minnesota.Trump's post said Homan has not previously been involved in Minnesota, where thousands of federal agents have been deployed in recent weeks to carry out the Trump administration's aggressive deportation agenda.The Good and Pretti killings have stoked massive protests, heated denunciations of ICE from Democrats and pleas for de-escalation from business leaders.As Homan takes the reins in Minnesota, Noem and other administration officials face mounting criticism, including from gun rights groups and some conservatives, over their leadership and rhetoric in Minneapolis.Fox News reported Sunday that some senior officials involved in immigration enforcement have \"grown increasingly uneasy & frustrated [with] some of the claims & narratives DHS pushed\" following the latest shooting.Axios reported last month that Noem and Homan have a tense and acrimonious working relationship. Trump has praised both officials.Noem, in a statement on X, said Trump's decision to tap Homan for Minnesota is \"good news for peace, safety, and accountability in Minneapolis.\" \"I have worked closely with Tom over the last year and he has been a major asset to our team— his experience and insight will help us in our wide-scale fraud investigations, which have robbed Americans, and will help us to remove even more public safety threats and violent criminal illegal aliens off the of streets of Minneapolis,\" Noem said.\"We continue to call on the leadership in Minnesota to allow for state and local partnership in our public safety mission,\" she said.The president's switch-up also comes as his polling numbers on immigration, and his overall approval rating, have declined, according to recent surveys from The New York Times and Siena University and others.A Reuters/Ipsos poll published Monday afternoon found just 39% of Americans approve of Trump's immigration efforts, marking his lowest reading in the survey since returning to the White House.In another Truth Social post later Monday morning, Trump said Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz called him and asked to work together in the state.\"It was a very good call, and we, actually, seemed to be on a similar wavelength,\" Trump wrote. \"I told Governor Walz that I would have Tom Homan call him, and that what we are looking for are any and all Criminals that they have in their possession.\"\"The Governor, very respectfully, understood that, and I will be speaking to him in the near future. He was happy that Tom Homan was going to Minnesota, and so am I!\" Trump added.The positive words for Walz telegraphed the shift in tone that the White House would later employ from the briefing room lectern. Previously, Trump administration officials have regularly castigated the Democratic governor, and even accused him of helping stoke the social strife in Minneapolis that led to the shootings.To be sure, Leavitt in Monday's briefing still laid blame for the unrest in Minnesota at Walz's feet.\"This tragedy occurred as a result of a deliberate and hostile resistance by Democrat leaders in Minnesota,\" she said. \"For weeks, Governor Walz and [Minneapolis Mayor Jacob] Frey and other elected Democrats were spreading lies about federal law enforcement officers who are risking their lives daily to remove the worst criminal illegal aliens from our streets.\"The government has reportedly subpoenaed Walz and other Minnesota Democrats as part of an investigation into possible obstruction of federal law enforcement operations in the state.Walz's office called the conversation with Trump \"productive,\" saying in a statement that the governor \"made the case that we need impartial investigations of the Minneapolis shootings involving federal agents.\"DHS, rather than the FBI, will conduct the investigation into the shooting of Pretti by the department's own officials, MS NOW reported Sunday, citing officials.Trump agreed to talk to DHS about \"ensuring the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension is able to conduct an independent investigation, as would ordinarily be the case,\" according to Walz's office.\"The President also agreed to look into reducing the number of federal agents in Minnesota and working with the state in a more coordinated fashion on immigration enforcement regarding violent criminals,\" the statement said.Tensions in Minnesota have boiled over after the two killings by federal agents in Minneapolis.Good, a 37-year-old mother of three, was fatally shot by ICE agent Jonathan Ross on Jan. 7 as she began to drive her SUV after another agent ordered her out of the car.On Saturday, Pretti, a 37-year-old intensive care unit nurse in Minneapolis, was shot and killed by federal officers.Both killings occurred in daylight in front of witnesses and were caught on video from multiple angles, massively ratcheting up the already-intense scrutiny over immigration agents' tactics and training.In both cases, numerous Trump administration officials rushed to defend the agents' actions as justified, while making claims about the incidents that later analyses found were contradicted by the evidence.On the same day that Pretti was killed, DHS claimed that he approached U.S. Border Patrol officers with a handgun and, after they attempted to disarm him, \"violently resisted.\"But videos show Pretti holding up a phone as the confrontation begins. And the clips also appear to show one officer removing a weapon from Pretti's person prior to any shots being fired.Pretti was believed to be a lawful gun owner with a permit to carry his weapon, Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O'Hara said at a news conference.",

    "body": "watch nowAmerican Airlines projected Tuesday that its focus on premium will \"begin delivering results in 2026\" as the carrier races to catch up to its far more profitable rivals and capitalize on strong demand from high-spending customers.The Fort Worth-based airline projected it will deliver nearly $2 of improvement in adjusted earnings per share at the midpoint over last year.American also expects to earn 7% to 10% more revenue in the first three months of 2026 compared with 2025.Here is how American performed in the fourth quarter compared with Wall Street estimates compiled by LSEG:Earnings per share: 16 cents adjusted vs. 34 cents expectedRevenue: $14 billion vs. $14.03 billion expectedAmerican posted net income of $99 million, or 15 cents per share, on revenue of $14 billion. Revenue was up 2.5% from last year. Excluding net special items, the company reported adjusted earnings per share of 16 cents.\"American Airlines is positioned for significant upside in 2026 and beyond,\" CEO Robert Isom said in a statement. \"We have built a strong foundation, and we look forward to taking advantage of the investments we have made in our customer experience, network, fleet, partnerships and loyalty program.\"The airline also said the government shutdown negatively impacted fourth quarter revenue by approximately $325 million.American said this weekend's winter storm, which marked Sunday as the largest flight cancellation day since the pandemic hit in early 2020, has resulted in a 1.5 percentage point reduction to the company's first quarter 2026 capacity guidance, along with an estimated negative revenue impact of $150 million to $200 million. American said Monday that five of its nine hub airports were disrupted by teh storm, including its largest hub at Dallas Fort Worth International Airport.The airline said passenger unit revenue was down 2.5% year-over-year, though that number would have been positive without the impact from the government shutdown. Premium product offerings continued to perform well, with year-over-year premium unit revenue outpacing the main cabin for the fourth quarter. American has been revamping its fleet, lounges and food and beverages to draw in customers who are willing to spend more on premium tickets and co-branded credit cards.

    "body": "Fcafotodigital | E+ | Getty ImagesThe IRS kicked off the 2026 tax season Monday, and filers will see changes from President Donald Trump's \"big beautiful bill\" that could affect their 2025 returns.About 164 million individual tax returns are expected before the April 15 deadline, and many could receive bigger tax refunds after Trump's 2025 legislation, experts say.   \"The size of refunds is a major political topic\" with the 2026 midterm election approaching, Andrew Lautz, director of tax policy for the Bipartisan Policy Center, a nonprofit think tank, told reporters during a call on Thursday. Read more CNBC personal finance coverageHow Trump's tax cuts will impact your return as the 2026 filing season opensFed may hold rates steady, despite pressure from Trump: What that means for youSocial Security benefits are taxed in some states.

What to considerTrump says inflation was 'defeated.' Some economists disagreeTrump touts 'big beautiful bill' tax breaks at Davos. Here's how they workTrump floats idea to extend business tax break to homeownersCNBC's Financial Advisor 100: Best financial advisors, top firms rankedTypically, a refund or balance due depends on taxes paid the previous year via paycheck withholdings or estimated payments. In 2025, the average refund for individual filers was $3,052 through Oct. 17, according to the IRS.\"There are a lot of things that are likely to drive higher refunds [during the 2026] filing season,\" including 2025 tax cuts and withholdings, Lautz said. After Trump's 2025 tax changes, the IRS didn't update withholding tables for employers, and many workers will see the effect of that when filing their returns in 2026. The Trump administration has floated a number of policy ideas focused on affordability as many Americans continue to struggle with the rising cost of living.However, more than half of Americans don't know how Trump's 2025 tax law changes will affect them, according to a new TaxSlayer survey, which polled 2,000 filers in November.Here's what taxpayers can expect during the 2026 filing season. Which tax breaks could affect your refundRefund size or taxes owed \"will vary significantly\" depending on individual circumstances, according to a Jan. 15 Tax Foundation analysis.Trump's 2025 tax law made permanent his 2017 tax breaks, which is \"mostly continuity from the current status quo,\" Garrett Watson, director of policy analysis at the Tax Foundation, a nonprofit think tank, told CNBC.However, the legislation also included a bigger standard deduction; more generous maximum child tax credit; a higher limit for the state and local tax, or SALT, deduction; a $6,000 tax break for seniors; and deductions for auto loan interest, tip income and overtime pay, among others. watch nowWho could see a bigger tax refund in 2026For 2025, the standard deduction increased to $15,750 for single filers and $31,500 for married couples filing jointly, up from $15,000 and $30,000, respectively.\"That's going to result in larger refunds for the 85% to 90% of taxpayers who claim the standard deduction each year,\" Lautz said.   Another tax break that could affect many filers is the new $6,000 \"bonus\" deduction for seniors age 65 and up. The full deduction is available with up to $75,000 in modified adjusted gross income or $150,000 for married couples filing jointly. Many families could also see a bigger child tax credit. For 2025, the maximum credit is $2,200, up from $2,000. Meanwhile, the SALT deduction and tax breaks for tip or overtime income could provide \"much larger\" cuts, but fewer filers will qualify, Lautz previously told CNBC.Correction: This story was updated to reflect that President Donald Trump's 2025 tax law made permanent his 2017 tax breaks. A previous version of this story gave an incorrect year.",

    "body": "Mustafa Suleyman CEO and co-founder of Inflection AI speaks during the Axios BFD event in New York City, U.S., October 12, 2023. Brendan Mcdermid | ReutersMicrosoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman said the software giant won't build artificial intelligence services that provide \"simulated erotica,\" distancing itself from longtime partner OpenAI.\"That's just not a service we're going to provide,\" Suleyman said on Thursday at the Paley International Council Summit in Menlo Park, California. \"Other companies will build that.\"Suleyman's comments come a week after OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said his company plans to allow verified adults to use ChatGPT for erotica. Altman said that OpenAI is \"not the elected moral police of the world.\"Microsoft has for years been a major investor and cloud partner to OpenAI, and the two companies have used their respective strengths to build big AI businesses. But the relationship has shown signs of tension of late, with OpenAI partnering with Microsoft rivals like Google and Oracle, and Microsoft focusing more on its own AI services.Earlier on Thursday, Microsoft announced a series of new features for its Copilot AI chatbot, including an AI companion called Mico that can respond to users through a call feature and express itself by changing its color.Suleyman in August penned an essay titled \"We must build AI for people; not to be a person.\" He argued that tech companies should not build \"seemingly conscious\" services that can give humans the impression that they may be capable of suffering, and wrote that conscious AIs could create another \"axis of division\" for humanity.On Thursday, Suleyman said the creation of seemingly conscious AI is already happening, primarily with erotica-focused services. He referenced Altman's comments as well as Elon Musk's Grok, which in July launched its own companion features, including a female anime character.\"You can already see it with some of these avatars and people leaning into the kind of sexbot erotica direction,\" Suleyman said. \"This is very dangerous, and I think we should be making conscious decisions to avoid those kinds of things.\"OpenAI didn't immediately respond to requests for comment, while xAI responded saying, \"Legacy Media Lies.\"WATCH: Why it's time to take AI-human relationships seriouslywatch now",

David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesChip equipment manufacturer Applied Materials is laying off 4% of its workforce.The company on Thursday began notifying impacted employees around the world \"across all levels and groups,\" it said in a filing. Applied Materials provides equipment, services and software to industries, including the semiconductor industry.Applied Materials had approximately 36,100 full-time employees, according to an August 2025 filing. A layoff of 4% would represent about 1,444 employees.\"Automation, digitalization and geographic shifts are redefining our workforce needs and skill requirements,\" the company wrote in the filing. \"With this in mind, we have been focused for some time on building high-velocity, high-productivity teams, adopting new technologies and simplifying organizational structures.\"The move comes at the end of the company's fiscal year. Earlier this month, the Applied Materials forecasted a $600 million hit to fiscal 2026 revenue after the U.S. expanded its restricted export list. That resulted in company shares to dipping 3% in extended trading.As a result of the workforce reduction, Applied Materials expects to incur charges of approximately $160 million to $180 million, consisting primarily of severance and other one-time employment termination benefits to be paid in cash, the filing states.The company said the cuts are a way to position itself \"as a more competitive and productive organization.\"",

    "body": "Changpeng Zhao, former chief executive officer of Binance, arrives at federal court in Seattle, Washington, US, on Tuesday, April 30, 2024. David Ryder | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesPresident Donald Trump has pardoned Binance founder Changpeng Zhao, who had previously pleaded guilty to enabling money laundering while heading the cryptocurrency exchange, the White House said Thursday.The pardon of Zhao, widely known as CZ, came two months after The Wall Street Journal reported that the Trump family's own crypto venture, which has generated about $4.5 billion since the 2024 election, has been helped by \"a partnership with an under-the-radar trading platform quietly administered by Binance.\"\"President Trump exercised his constitutional authority by issuing a pardon for Mr. Zhao, who was prosecuted by the Biden Administration in their war on cryptocurrency,\" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement.\"In their desire to punish the cryptocurrency industry, the Biden Administration pursued Mr. Zhao despite no allegations of fraud or identifiable victims,\" Leavitt said.Trump, asked later Thursday why he pardoned Zhao, said, \"I don't know, he was recommended by a lot of people.\"\"A lot of people say that he wasn't guilty of anything,\" Trump said. \"And so I gave him a pardon at the request of a lot of very good people.\"NBC News, citing a public disclosure filing from Monday, reported that Binance in September had retained the services of the lobbyist Charles McDowell, who is a friend of the president's son, Donald Trump Jr.McDowell's lobbying firm, Checkmate Government Relations, disclosed that it was paid $450,000 for the prior month's work, which included lobbying the White House and Treasury Department for \"executive relief\" and \"financial services policy issues relating to digital assets and cryptocurrency.\"The clemency grant for Zhao came nearly a week after Trump commuted the 87-month prison sentence of former New York Rep. George Santos, who had pleaded guilty to wire fraud and aggravated identity theft.\"Deeply grateful for today's pardon and to President Trump for upholding America's commitment to fairness, innovation, and justice,\" Zhao wrote in a post on X.\"Will do everything we can to help make America the Capital of Crypto and advance web3 worldwide,\" he wrote, before adding, \"still in flight, more posts to come.\"Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., blasted the pardon, calling it an example of \"corruption.\"\"First, Changpeng Zhao pleaded guilty to a criminal money laundering charge,\" said Warren, who is the ranking member of the Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee.\"Then he boosted one of Donald Trump's crypto ventures and lobbied for a pardon,\" she said.\"Today, Donald Trump did his part and pardoned him. If Congress does not stop this kind of corruption in pending market structure legislation, it owns this lawlessness.\"Binance, in a statement obtained by NBC News, said, \"Incredible news of CZ's pardon today.\"\"We thank President Trump for his leadership and for his commitment to make the US the crypto capital of the world. CZ's vision not only made Binance the world's largest crypto exchange but shaped the broader crypto movement,\" the company said.Zhao, in November 2023, pleaded guilty in Seattle federal court and agreed to step down as Binance CEO as part of a $4.3 billion settlement by the company with the Department of Justice.Zhao had been charged with violating the Bank Secrecy Act for failing to implement an effective anti-money-laundering program and for willfully violating U.S. economic sanction in an intentional effort to profit from the American market without implementing legally required controls, the DOJ said.Binance had been charged with conducting an unlicensed money-transmitting business, violating the International Emergency Economic Powers Act and conspiracy.He was sentenced in April 2024 to just four months in jail.Federal prosecutors had asked a judge to sentence Zhao to three years in prison.Then-Attorney General Merrick Garland blasted Binance when Zhao pleaded guilty.\"Binance became the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange in part because of the crimes it committed – now it is paying one of the largest corporate penalties in U.S. history,\" Garland said at the time.Then-Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, the same day, said, \"Binance turned a blind eye to its legal obligations in the pursuit of profit. Its willful failures allowed money to flow to terrorists, cybercriminals, and child abusers through its platform.\"Leavitt, in her statement Thursday, noted that prosecutors had asked for a three-year sentence.\"The Biden Administration sought to imprison Mr. Zhao for three years, a sentence so outside Sentencing Guidelines that even the Judge said he had never heard of this in his 30-year career,\" Leavitt said.\"These actions by the Biden Administration severely damaged the United States' reputation as a global leader in technology and innovation,\" she said. \"The Biden Administration's war on crypto is over.\"Correction: Binance had been charged with violating the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. An earlier version misstated the name of the act.",

    "body": "watch nowWith a handful of mega-cap tech and AI stocks at the top of the S&P 500 Index dominating the U.S. market in a way without historical precedent, portfolio concentration risk has taken on a new form for investors long told to follow some version of Warren Buffett's stock advice to \"never bet against America.\"But with the nine tech stocks that are above Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway by weight in the index representing nearly 40% of the market, it's an imbalance that has investors looking for new ways to hedge. Buffett may not agree with their response, either, having been a long-time vocal doubter on the value of precious metals, but many are moving toward cash, gold, and crypto to find uncorrelated returns and protection from volatility.\"If you break down category ETF flows, it's cash, precious metals, and then crypto,\" Todd Sohn, Strategas Securities senior ETF and technical strategist, said on CNBC's \"ETF Edge\" earlier this week, referencing what have been the most popular trades by investors this year. \"They're clearly being adopted by more mainstream [investors].\"He linked this trend directly to concentration risk. \"Some investors are realizing they have a lot of tech and AI exposure, so they have to differentiate and find uncorrelated assets,\" Sohn said.While some experts are recommending eyebrow-raising allocations to gold and crypto, and there is more talk of a 60-20-20 portfolio to replace the classic 60-40 stock-bond mix, most allocations are still small, but growing.\"Most of the conversations I have and the allocation papers I'll read say one to three percent on crypto and three to seven [percent] on gold,\" Sohn said.Gold has experienced a rough week, with significant selling, but up over 60% for the year coming into this week's trading, it is not a major surprise to see some profit-taking. Gold had hit record highs above $4,400 this month, supported by central bank buying, a depreciating dollar, and persistent geopolitical risk, the so-called \"debasement trade.\"The SPDR Gold Shares (GLD) has seen around $6.8 billion in flows over the past month, in a year during which gold funds have neared the $40 billion mark in net inflows from investors.Crypto, the newer hedge becoming more compelling to investors, has also had a good year, though gold has more than tripled bitcoin's return of 17%, while ethereum has gained 15%. The launch of spot bitcoin ETFs has brought institutional money into the space and has turned digital assets into legitimate portfolio tools. The iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) is one of the largest spot bitcoin ETFs, managing close to $90 billion in assets, according to VettaFi.Sohn says the use of ETFs to access new approaches to the market has been core to its history and evolution. \"We started with large-cap equities in '93, gold and emerging markets in 2004, and now we have covered call and yield-max products,\" Sohn said.That also means investors can manage risk differently. Instead of relying on high-yield stocks or simple bond funds, they can build portfolios with derivative-based ETFs or alternative exposures.Crypto tells a similar story. With regulated ETFs now in place, bitcoin and ethereum have moved from speculative trades to recognized components of diversified strategies. \"The pace of these developments and innovation that launches these ETFs is lightning speed,\" Sohn said.Sign up for our weekly newsletter that goes beyond the livestream, offering a closer look at the trends and figures shaping the ETF market.Disclaimer",

Photos showed the building largely reduced to rubble.Trump said Wednesday that the 90,000 square foot ballroom will cost $300 million, higher than the original estimated price tag of $200 million.The White House has dismissed public anger over the demolition as \"manufactured outrage.\" The Treasury Department, which has a clear view of the demolition, banned its staff from sharing photos.Trump promised in July that the ballroom would not impact the East Wing.\"It'll be near it but not touching it, and pays total respect to the existing building, which I'm the biggest fan of,\" Trump said at the time.When asked about the demolition on Wednesday, Trump said the East Wing was \"very small\" and \"never thought of as being much.\"\"In order to do it properly we had to take down the existing structure,\" the president told reporters.Construction workers, bottom right, atop the U.S. Treasury, watch as work continues on a largely demolished part of the East Wing of the White House, Thursday, Oct. 23, 2025, in Washington, before construction of a new ballroom. Jacquelyn Martin | APA senior White House official cited \"structural reasons\" for the decision to knock down East Wing when asked by CNBC on Wednesday.White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Thursday that the administration was not required to submit plans to the National Capital Planning Commission for the demolition.\"Their general counsel has said when it comes to phase one of this project, the tearing down of the current East Wing structure, a submission is not required legally for that, only for vertical construction,\" Leavitt told reporters.Imagery shows after White House East Wing demolition.

    "body": "A Target logo is displayed outside one of their stores on August 2, 2025 in San Diego, California. Kevin Carter | Getty ImagesTarget said on Thursday it's cutting 1,800 corporate jobs as the retailer tries to get back to growth after four years of roughly stagnant sales.It marks the first major round of layoffs in a decade for the Minneapolis-based retailer. It announced the layoffs in a memo sent by Target's incoming CEO Michael Fiddelke to employees at its headquarters.The eliminated roles are a combination of about 1,000 employee layoffs and about 800 positions that will no longer be filled, a company spokesman said. Together, they represent an approximately 8% cut to Target's corporate workforce, according to the memo. Affected employees will be notified Tuesday.The retailer announced the cuts as it nears a leadership change.Target in August named Fiddelke, currently its chief operating officer and formerly chief financial officer, as the successor to longtime leader Brian Cornell. He takes the helm February 1.Fiddelke has also overseen the Enterprise Acceleration Office, an effort announced in May, which looked for ways to simplify company operations, use technology in new ways and speed up Target's growth. Target has been fighting a sales slump, as it tries to rebound from declining store traffic, inventory troubles and customer backlash. The company has said it expects annual sales to decline this year. Its shares have fallen by 65% since their all-time high in late 2021.Compared to retail competitors, Target draws less of its overall sales from groceries and other necessities, which can make its business more vulnerable to the ups and downs of the economy and consumer sentiment. About half of Target's sales come from discretionary items, compared to only 40% at Walmart, according to estimates from GlobalData Retail.As a result of that and other company-specific challenges, Target's sales trends and stock performance have diverged sharply from competitors. Shares of Walmart are up about 123% in the past five years, compared to Target's decline of 41% during the same time period.In a memo sent Thursday to employees at Target's headquarters, Fiddelke said the employee cuts will help Target make urgent changes.\"The truth is, the complexity we've created over time has been holding us back,\" he said in the memo. \"Too many layers and overlapping work have slowed decisions, making it harder to bring ideas to life.\"He said the cuts are difficult, but \"a necessary step in building the future of Target and enabling the progress and growth we all want to see.\"   Target employees affected by the layoffs will receive pay and benefits until January 3, in addition to severance packages, according to a company spokesman. No roles in stores or in Target's supply chain were impacted by the cuts, the company spokesman said.Read the full memo from Fiddelke:Team, This spring, we launched our enterprise acceleration efforts with a clear ambition: to move faster and simplify how we work to drive Target's next chapter of growth. The truth is, the complexity we've created over time has been holding us back. Too many layers and overlapping work have slowed decisions, making it harder to bring ideas to life. On Tuesday, we'll share changes to our headquarters structure as an important step in accelerating how we work. This includes eliminating about 1,800 non-field roles — about 8% of our global HQ team. As we make these changes, I'm asking all U.S. HQ team members to work from home next week. Target in India and our other global teams will follow their in-office routines. Decisions that affect our team are the most significant ones we make, and we never make them lightly. I know the real impact this has on our team, and it will be difficult. And, it's a necessary step in building the future of Target and enabling the progress and growth we all want to see.   Adjusting our structure is one part of the work ahead of us. It will also require new behaviors and sharper priorities that strengthen our retail leadership in style and design and enable faster execution so we can: Lead with merchandising authority; Elevate the guest experience with every interaction; and Accelerate technology to enable our team and delight our guests. Put together, these changes set the course for our company to be stronger, faster and better positioned to serve guests and communities for many years to come. Michael ",

    "body": "An 'Open House' sign is posted near a single family home for sale on Aug. 22, 2025 in Pasadena, California. Mario Tama | Getty ImagesSales of previously owned homes rose 1.5% in September from August to a seasonally adjusted, annualized rate of 4.06 million units, according to the National Association of Realtors. That is slightly less than the analysts were forecasting, but the highest pace in seven months.Sales were 4.1% higher compared with September of last year.Regionally, on an annual basis, sales were strongest in the South and Northeast. From August, sales were strongest in the West and actually fell slightly in the Midwest, the only region to see a monthly decline.This count is based on closings, so people signing contracts likely in July and August, when mortgage rates were coming down but were not as low as they are now. The average rate on the 30-year fixed started July at 6.67% and is now at 6.17%, according to Mortgage News Daily. \"As anticipated, falling mortgage rates are lifting home sales,\" said Lawrence Yun, NAR's chief economist. \"Improving housing affordability is also contributing to the increase in sales.\"Inventory continued to make gains, up 14% from a year ago to 1.55 million units for sale at the end of September. That is still lean historically. At the current sales pace, there is a 4.6-month supply of homes for sale. A six-month supply is considered balanced between buyer and seller.Get Property Play directly to your inboxCNBC's Property Play with Diana Olick covers new and evolving opportunities for the real estate investor, delivered weekly to your inbox.Subscribe here to get access today.\"Inventory is matching a five-year high, though it remains below pre-Covid levels,\" Yun added. \"Many homeowners are financially comfortable, resulting in very few distressed properties and forced sales. Home prices continue to rise in most parts of the country, further contributing to overall household wealth.\" Still tight supply continues to pressure prices. The median price of a home sold in September was $415,200, up 2.1% year over year and the 27th consecutive month of annual gains. Prices are 53% higher than pre-Covid levels.Sales continue to see the biggest gains on the high end of the market, likely because of more supply in those tiers. Sales of home priced above $1 million rose 20% from the year before, while sales of homes priced below $100,000 were up just under 3%.First-time homebuyers are making some gains, likely due to falling mortgage rates. They made up 30% of September sales, up from 26% the year before.About 30% of sales were made all in cash. Homes are sitting on the market longer, an average 33 days, up from 28 a year ago.",

    "body": "A Ford logo on a Ford F-150 pickup truck for sale in Encinitas, California, U.S. Oct. 20, 2025. Mike Blake | ReutersDETROIT – Ford Motor beat Wall Street's third-quarter earnings expectations but lowered its 2025 guidance due to impacts of a supplier fire, which is disrupting production of its highly profitable large trucks and SUVs.The Detroit automaker said the fire last month at a New York plant for aluminum supplier Novelis is expected to cost it between $1.5 billion and $2 billion, but it expects to mitigate much of that this year and next, largely by increasing manufacturing of the impacted vehicles once supplies are more available.Ford stock initially fell during extended trading Thursday before swinging to being up roughly 4%. It closed at $12.34 per share Thursday and the stock is up 24% so far this year.Ford said the total cost of the fire on its business is expected to be less than $1 billion by next year, as the company announced plans Thursday to \"significantly increase\" its U.S. pickup truck production. That includes adding 1,000 workers early next year to plants that produce the vehicles in Michigan and Kentucky. The automaker expects the additional production next year to recoup about half of the 100,000 units it expects to lose due to the fire this year.\"We are working intensively with Novelis and others to source aluminum that can be processed in the cold rolling section of the plant that remains operational while also working to restore overall plant production. We have made substantial progress in a short time to minimize the impact in 2025 and recover production in 2026,\" Ford CEO Jim Farley said in a statement.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconFord stockFord Chief Operating Officer Kumar Galhotra said the fire occurred in one of three main parts of the plant — a hot mill — with the non-impacted areas continuing to operate. The impacted part of the plant is expected to restart sooner than originally expected in late November or early December, he said.Ford's new 2025 guidance includes adjusted earnings before interest and taxes of $6 billion to $6.5 billion, down from $6.5 billion to $7.5 billion as of July; adjusted free cash flow of $2 billion to $3 billion, down from $3.5 billion to $4.5 billion, and capital spending of roughly $9 billion, which remains the same.Ford CFO Sherry House said without the supplier fire, the company was planning to raise its 2025 guidance to more than $8 billion in adjusted EBIT rather than cutting it.RBC Markets analyst Tom Narayan in a note Thursday called the guidance change \"effectively\" a raise, backing out the supplier fire and changes in tariff costs.Ford lowered its expected tariff costs by $1 billion, to roughly $2 billion,  half of which the automaker expects to offset through other actions, due to changes Friday by the Trump administration that included exemption and extending tariff offsets on American-made vehicles.Here's what Wall Street expects, based on average analysts' estimates compiled by LSEG:Earnings per share: 45 cents adjusted vs. 36 cents expectedAutomotive revenue: $47.19 billion vs. $43.08 billion expectedFord said there was no material impact to third-quarter results due to the fire, but that it will impact its fourth-quarter results.The company's third-quarter revenue, including its financial arm, was $50.5 billion, a quarterly record and 9% increase from the same time a year ago. Its net income during the quarter was $2.4 billion, up from $900 million a year earlier, and adjusted earnings before interest and taxes were level at $2.6 billion. Both included adverse net tariff-related impact of $700 million during the third quarter.Adjusted earnings exclude one-time or special items, some interest and taxes as well as other financials not considered \"core\" to the company's operations. \"Our performance in the quarter show that the Ford+ plan is delivering consistent improvement. Our underlying business becomes stronger, more efficient, more agile and increasingly durable,\" House told media Thursday.The Ford+ plan is a turnaround and cost-improvement plan under Farley, who started leading the automaker more than five years ago. The company said it remains on track to cut $1 billion in costs this year as part of the plan.Ford's third-quarter results were led by its \"Pro\" commercial and fleet business that reported EBIT results of nearly $2 billion, up $172 million from a year earlier. Its traditional operations, known as \"Ford Blue\" reported EBIT earnings of $1.54 billion, while its \"Model e\" electric vehicle business widened losses by $179 million compared with a year ago, to $1.41 billion.",

    "body": "An exhibition room at Pop Mart's theme park, Pop Land, in Beijing, on June 18, 2025.Pedro Pardo | Afp | Getty ImagesShares of Chinese toymaker Pop Mart fell 9% Thursday, notching the stock's worst day since April and extending its declines since a late-August peak.The company behind the popular Labubu dolls, a series of collectible elf-like monster dolls that come in blind-box packaging, reported on Tuesday that third-quarter revenue had more than tripled year over year as sales in the U.S. swelled between 1,265% and 1,270%.And yet concerns are growing the craze could be fading.Data from Chinese resale platform Qiandao shows that some Labubus are being sold close to or below official Pop Mart retail prices, a stark shift after a period of sky-high demand and prices. The Labubu character Luck, released in April, for example, saw its resale price soar to over 500 yuan, or about $70, at one point. But that's since dropped to 108 yuan, or about $15, according to Qiandao.Since August, Pop Mart stock has fallen 30%, but is still up 159% so far this year.Analysts are split on how to interpret the downturn.One line of thinking is that the falling resale prices could signal slowing enthusiasm for Labubu and other collectibles after a summer peak, particularly among younger, nontraditional toy buyers. Another possibility: The decline may reflect Pop Mart's efforts to increase supply and curb scalping, rather than waning consumer demand.Pop Mart reported a 10-fold increase in the supply of plush toys this year and said it now manufactures approximately 30 million units each month, the company told Reuters on Tuesday.Morgan Stanley analysts noted in a September client note that \"prices in the second-hand market do not effectively reflect the true supply and demand situation,\" especially given Pop Mart's initiatives to limit resellers' influence.The popularity of the Labubu dolls have been boosted by celebrity fans including singer Rihanna and former soccer star David Beckham. However, Labubus aren't the only Pop Mart product drawing the eye of nontraditional toy buyers.Morgan Stanley analysts noted that emerging characters like Twinkle Twinkle and opportunities for global expansion continue to play a key role in driving Pop Mart's growth.",

    "body": "Los Angeles Lakers forward LeBron James (23) prepares to shoot a foul shot against the Minnesota Timberwolves at Crypto.com Arena on October 22,  2024 in Los Angeles, California. Gina Ferazzi | Los Angeles Times | Getty ImagesA new bombshell indictment criminally charging former NBA player Damon Jones suggests that while affiliated with the Los Angeles Lakers, Jones leaked information about the injury status of superstar LeBron James to sports bettors before a February 2023 game.The same indictment suggests Jones leaked information to bettors about the playing status of then-Lakers star Anthony Davis before a January 2024 game against the Oklahoma City Thunder.The indictment said that Jones told a co-defendant that a star Laker identified only as Player 4 was \"probable\" for that game. Davis was the only player listed as \"probable\" for that game, according to records.One of those bettors who received the information then placed a bet of approximately $100,000 against the Lakers, who ended up winning the game, with Davis playing up to his usual standards.Neither James nor Davis. who now plays with the Dallas Mavericks, is accused of wrongdoing in the federal indictment unsealed Thursday in U.S. District Court in Brooklyn, New York.Jones, 49, Miami Heat player Terry Rozier, and four other men are charged with defrauding betting companies and conspiracy to commit money laundering in the case.Jones and James previously played together on the Cleveland Cavaliers. Jones was acting as an unofficial coach for the Lakers at the time of the February 2023 game in Los Angeles that is mentioned in the indictment.A James spokesman declined to comment to CNBC. A spokesman for Davis did not respond to requests for comment.Get the CNBC Sport newsletter directly to your inboxThe CNBC Sport newsletter with Alex Sherman brings you the biggest news and exclusive interviews from the worlds of sports business and media, delivered weekly to your inbox.Subscribe here to get access today.The indictment refers to an unidentified Player 3.The document says that Jones \"was a teammate and coach of a prominent player,\" who was Player 3.The indictment says that Jones, on the morning of a Feb. 9 game between the Lakers and the Milwaukee Bucks \"sent a text message to Co-Conspirator 9, writing: 'Get a big bet on Milwaukee tonight before the information is out! [Player 3] is out tonight. Bet enough so Djones can eat ... now!\"\"At the time Jones provided this non-public information about Player 3 to Co-Conspirator 9, Player 3 was not ruled out on the NBA's injury report for the\" game, the indictment says.James ended up sitting out that Feb. 9 game with a lower-body injury, to his ankleThe indictment says, \"Due to a lower body injury, Player 3 did not play in the February 9 Game.\"The only other active Laker player to sit out that game with an injury was Scotty Pippen Jr., who did not have a lower-body injury. Pippen was in the concussion protocol for the game.Milwaukee defeated the Lakers in that game by a score of 115 to 106.The Bucks went into the game as a favorite by an average of 8 points, according to various odds sites.A person familiar with James' situation said James did not know his information would be used for betting.Coach Damon Jones looks on during the game during the 2025 G League Elite Camp on May 11, 2025 at Windtrust Arena in Chicago, Illinois.Jeff Haynes | National Basketball Association | Getty ImagesOther wording in the indictment suggests that Davis is the person identified only as Player 4, who the charging document says was \"one of the best Lakers' players during the 2023-2024 season.\"Before a Jan. 15, 2024, Lakers game at home against the Thunder, Jones \"claimed to have learned from the trainer for Players 3 and 4 that Player 4 was injured and only going to play a limited number of minutes and/or his performance would likely be affected in the game because of the injury,\" the indictment says.Jones then allegedly shared that non-public information with his co-defendant, Eric Earnest, \"who then sent a text message to the defendant Marves Fairley, stating, \"Hit me asap gone one for u dude say he got some info.\"Earnest then allegedly shared information about Player 4 with Fairley, who in turn shared the information with two other people, according to the indictment. Fairley, who paid Jones $2,500 for the tip, and a co-conspirator then placed multiple bets against the Lakers, with Fairley putting down about $100,000, the indictment alleges.Anthony Davis #3 of the Los Angeles Lakers shoots a free throw during the game against the Charlotte Hornets on Jan. 27, 2025 at Spectrum Center in Charlotte, North Carolina. Brock Williams-Smith | National Basketball Association | Getty Images\"Hours before the January 15 game, the NBA injury report listed Player 4 as 'probable,' and it was not publicly disseminated, including to the Betting Companies, that Player 4 would possibly play a limited number of minutes and/or poorly due to injury,\" the indictment said.But, \"ultimately, Player 4 played in the January 15 game in line with his season average in minutes and performed well, and the Lakers won the game,\" the indictment noted.Afterward, Fairley asked that Jones repay Fairley his $2,500 for the tip, according to the charging document.No other player other than Davis was listed as probable for that Thunder game.— Additional reporting by CNBC's Jessica Golden",

    "body": "Priscilla Chan, left, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, and Lauren Sanchez are among guests attending Donald Trump's inauguration as the 47th U.S. president in the Capitol Rotunda in Washington, D.C., Jan. 20, 2025.Saul Loeb | Afp | Getty ImagesMeta said Thursday that it's laying off an undisclosed number of employees in its risk organization as the company shifts to use artificial intelligence to automate its compliance review process.Michel Protti, Meta's chief privacy and compliance officer for product, disclosed the layoffs on Wednesday to members of the company's risk organization, according to a report by Business Insider. CNBC confirmed the contents of that story. Meta's risk organization is tasked with assessing and documenting various product and feature risks and ensure that the company is complying with regulators worldwide. The organization was established after the company formerly known as Facebook was slapped with a $5 billion fine by the Federal Trade Commission as part of a settlement that also required that the social media giant restructure its approach to privacy.The job reductions come amid broader organizational restructurings at Meta, including its decision on Wednesday to lay off about 600 employees who work in the company's Superintelligence Labs AI unit. The cuts, however, did not impact Meta's top-tier TBD Labs division within the AI unit.\"Through our product risk and compliance team, we've built one of the most sophisticated compliance programs in the industry to help us evaluate our products and features,\" a Meta spokesperson said in a statement. \"We routinely make organizational changes and are restructuring our team to reflect the maturity of our program and innovate faster while maintaining high compliance standards.\"Meta promoted Protti to lead the company's privacy program in 2019 following the settlement with the FTC related to the company's Cambridge Analytica data privacy scandal.The social media company has spent the past year developing AI technology to streamline risk management. The Meta spokesperson said that the company's revamped risk management system relies on more basic automation rather than more bleeding-edge AI technologies that can generate compelling text based on written prompts.Meta Vice President of Policy Rob Sherman said in a June LinkedIn post that the company \"built a tool that helps teams automatically identify when legal and policy requirements apply to specific products.\"\"We're not using AI to make decisions on risk,\" Sherman wrote. \"Instead, the rules are applied using automation, reducing time experts need to spend on the ratified decisions, while increasing reliability because there's less room for human error.\"Other companies are also increasingly pointing to the use of AI technologies to reduce their workforce.Major banks like JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs are pitching AI projects to bolster profitability while slowing headcount growth. JPMorgan finance chief Jeremy Barnum told analysts during the firm's most recent earnings report that bank managers have been directed to avoid hiring people amid a broader AI rollout, CNBC reported last week.Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff said in September that his software vendor would cut 4,000 customer support roles because of AI's growing capabilities and the \"benefits and efficiencies\" of the company's Agentforce software. \"We've seen the number of support cases we handle decline and we no longer need to actively backfill support engineer roles,\" Salesforce said in a statement at the time.WATCH: A rotation out of the US is a bet against the AI trade.watch now",

    "body": "ESPN and YouTube TV.David Buono | Icon Sportswire | Jaque Silva | NurPhoto | Getty ImagesJust a month after reaching an agreement with NBCUniversal to avoid dropping its networks, YouTube TV has another potential blackout on its hands — this time with Disney.Disney said Thursday it would begin running public messages for YouTube TV subscribers to alert customers that the company's networks, including ABC and ESPN, will be dropped from the service if the two sides can't reach a new distribution agreement, which expires October 30 at 11:59 p.m. ET.\"This is the latest example of Google exploiting its position at the expense of their own customers,\" a Disney spokesperson said in a statement. \"If we don't reach a fair deal soon, YouTube TV customers will lose access to ESPN and ABC, and all our marquee programming — including the NFL, college football, NBA and NHL seasons — and so much more.\"Disney began running public announcements on YouTube TV at 5 p.m. ET.As with NBCUniversal, YouTube TV is asking for better rates for Disney's programming, according to people familiar with the discussions. YouTube TV has about 10 million subscribers and wants more favorable terms given their scale, the people said.\"We've been working in good faith to negotiate a deal with Disney that pays them fairly for their content on YouTube TV,\" a spokesperson for the service said in a statement. \"Unfortunately, Disney is proposing costly economic terms that would raise prices on YouTube TV customers and give our customers fewer choices, while benefiting Disney's own live TV products - like Hulu + Live TV and, soon, Fubo. Without an agreement, we'll have to remove Disney's content from YouTube TV and if it remains unavailable for an extended period of time, we will offer subscribers a $20 credit.\"Get the CNBC Sport newsletter directly to your inboxThe CNBC Sport newsletter with Alex Sherman brings you the biggest news and exclusive interviews from the worlds of sports business and media, delivered weekly to your inbox.Subscribe here to get access today.YouTube TV and NBCUniversal first reached a temporary extension to avoid a blackout before inking a finalized deal a few days later.Two years ago, Disney reached an unusual distribution agreement with Charter, the largest U.S. pay TV provider by subscribers, that gave certain Charter subscribers access to Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+ for no extra charge. Disney is willing to offer YouTube TV the same terms as that Charter agreement, two of the people said.YouTube TV is again asking to ingest Disney's streaming content, giving customers the ability to view programming on Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+ without leaving the YouTube platform, according to a person familiar with the negotiations. YouTube TV also asked for this in its negotiations with NBCUniversal and was rejected. Similarly, Disney has no plans to say yes to this request, according to people familiar with the company's thinking.The clash between Disney and YouTube has an added element of conflict. YouTube hired away former Disney distribution executive Justin Connolly earlier this year, prompting Disney to file a breach of contract lawsuit. Connolly has recused himself from these discussions, according to the people familiar with the process.Disclosure: Comcast is the parent company of NBCUniversal, which owns CNBC. Versant would become the new parent company of CNBC upon Comcast's planned spinoff of Versant.",

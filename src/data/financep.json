    "body": "People shop for groceries at a store in Port Washington, New York, U.S., Nov. 19, 2025. Shannon Stapleton | ReutersConsumer prices rose less than expected in November, giving investors hope that inflationary pressures may be cooling enough for U.S. monetary policy to be eased more than Wall Street anticipates. The consumer price index rose at a 2.7% annualized rate last month, a delayed report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics showed. Economists polled by Dow Jones expected the CPI to have risen 3.1%. The core CPI, which strips out volatile food and energy prices, was also cooler than anticipated, increasing 2.6% over 12 months. It was expected to have risen by 3%. The monthly increases also were less than expected, with both the all-items and core CPI gains at 0.2%, compared to estimates of 0.3%.This is the first report that encompasses the period during which the U.S. government was shut down. The stoppage disrupted the data collection process in that time. It also led to the cancellation of the October CPI release. This data was originally expected to be released Dec. 10.Because the October CPI was canceled, Thursday's report did not have all the usual data points of a typical CPI release. The BLS said it was unable to retroactively collect the October data, but did use some \"nonsurvey data sources\" to make the index calculations. On a 12-month basis, food prices rose 2.6% and energy was up 4.2%. Shelter costs, which make up about one-third of the weighting in the index, rose 3%, indicating progress towards the Fed's 2% overall inflation goal. Shelter had been a major contributors towards elevated inflation readings.Economists may be hesitant to read too much into this report as the start of a downward trend in inflation because of the lack of October comparison data in the release.Still, investors parsed through the report as they look for clues on future monetary policy moves from the Federal Reserve. The Fed earlier this month cut its benchmark overnight rate by 25 basis points for the third time in a row. \"A tame CPI will reinforce the Fed is focused on protecting the employment market. And that means a Fed 'put' is now in place for the economy,\" Tom Lee, head of research at Fundstrat, said in a note ahead of Thursday's release. \"In other words, if the Fed is concerned about downside risks to the economy, the Fed 'put' comes into play and this would be for stocks to rise.\"Odds for a January rate cut remained low, but traders began pricing in a higher chance of a March reduction. The CME Group's FedWatch tool showed a 58.3% probability of a rate cut for the month, up from around 53.9% on Wednesday. Stock futures jumped following the release. S&P 500 futures were up about 0.5% as of 8:39 a.m. ET. A gain would snap a four-day losing streak for the benchmark index. Treasury yields slipped, with the 10-year note yield last trading around 4.11%.— CNBC's Sean Conlon contributed reporting.",

    "body": "Kazuo Ueda, governor of the Bank of Japan (BOJ), during a committee on financial affairs meeting at the lower house of parliament in Tokyo, Japan, on Friday, Nov. 21, 2025.Bloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesJapan's central bank on Friday raised its short-term rates to a three-decade high, marching ahead with its policy normalization, as inflation has stayed above its target levels for nearly four years now.    The Bank of Japan raised benchmark rates by 25 basis points to 0.75%, their highest level since 1995, and in line with expectations of economists polled by Reuters. The BOJ said that real interest rates are expected to remain \"significantly negative,\" adding that accommodative financial conditions will continue to firmly support economic activity.Following the decision, the yield on 10-year Japanese government bonds breached the 2% mark for the first time since 2006, while the yen weakened 0.20% to 155.79 against the dollar. The benchmark Nikkei 225 stock index gained 1.21%.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconJapan embarked on policy normalization last year, abandoning the world's only negative interest rate regime that had been in place since 2016. Since then, the BOJ has consistently maintained its stance on gradually lifting rates, stating that its goal was to see a \"virtuous cycle\" of rising wages and prices.Inflation has run above above the BOJ's 2% target for 44 straight months, with  data released earlier in the day showing consumer price growth at 2.9% in November. High inflation has pressured real wages that have been declining for 10 months in a row, according to labor ministry data. The BOJ projected that core inflation — which strips out the prices of fresh food —  is likely to decelerate below 2% from April to September 2026, due to a slower rise in food prices as well as the effects of government measures aimed at addressing rising prices.Higher rates risk exacerbating the downturn in the Japanese economy. Revised GDP numbers for the third quarter showed that economy shrank more than initially estimated, contracting 0.6% quarter on quarter, and 2.3% on an annualized basis.   The BOJ said in its statement that while weakness has been seen in the economy, corporate profits were likely to remain high, and firms are expected to continue raising wages in 2026.\"It is highly likely that the mechanism in which both wages and prices rise moderately will be maintained,\" the bank said, adding that the possibility of underlying inflation reaching its 2% target was rising. The rate hike also comes at a time when JGB yields have been hitting multi-decade highs, spiking further after the decision, raising the risk of higher borrowing costs for Japan and increasing fiscal strain. Asia's second-largest economy already boasts of the world's highest debt-to-GDP ratio, standing at almost 230%, according to data from the International Monetary Fund.Rising yields could, however, support the Japanese currency. The yen has been trading around 154-157 against the dollar since November, having weakened over 2.5% since Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi, a proponent of looser monetary policy, took office in October.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconAfter this hike, the BOJ is likely to raise its policy rate in mid-2026, taking it to a terminal rate of 1%, Shigeto Nagai, head of Japan Economics at Oxford Economics, said in a statement to CNBC before the BOJ decision. Terminal or neutral rate refers to one that balances inflation and economic growth — it neither overheats, nor slows down the economy.BOJ Governor Kazuo Ueda reportedly said earlier this month that it was difficult to estimate the terminal rate, with the central bank pegging it at 1% to 2.5%.Nagai warned that another rate hike by the BOJ could cause friction with Takaichi, if inflation declines smoothly towards 2% in the first half of 2026. Takaichi during her leadership contest had staunchly opposed rate hikes by the BOJ, but has since softened her stance.Nagai said that the reasons that Takaichi would accept this rate hike was because of the weak yen, and that \"addressing the cost-of-living crisis has become an urgent policy issue.\"In November, Japan's cabinet approved a stimulus package totaling 21.3 trillion yen ($135.5 billion) as  Takaichi seeks to boost the country's slowing economy and offer support to inflation-hit consumers.",

    "body": "President Donald Trump speaks during the unveiling of the Kennedy Center Honors nominees at the Kennedy Center in Washington, Aug. 13, 2025.Mandel Ngan | Afp | Getty ImagesThe John F. Kennedy Memorial Center for the Performing Arts, commonly known as the Kennedy Center, will be renamed the \"Trump-Kennedy Center,\" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Thursday.The prestigious Washington cultural center's board of trustees, who were appointed by President Donald Trump in February, \"have just voted unanimously\" on the name change, Leavitt said in an X post.They did so \"because of the unbelievable work President Trump has done over the last year in saving the building,\" Leavitt said.\"Congratulations to President Donald J. Trump, and likewise, congratulations to President Kennedy, because this will be a truly great team long into the future! The building will no doubt attain new levels of success and grandeur,\" she said.The move may face challenges, however: U.S. code states that no new \"memorials or plaques in the nature of memorials shall be designated or installed in the public areas of the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts.\"To change that would require Congress, NBC News reported in July. House Republicans have already introduced at least one bill to rename the center in Trump's honor.\"The Kennedy Center is a living memorial to a fallen president and named for President Kennedy by federal law,\" said former Democratic Rep. Joe Kennedy III, a grandnephew of former President Kennedy, on X. \"It can no sooner be renamed than can someone rename the Lincoln Memorial, no matter what anyone says,\" he wrote.Leavitt's depiction of a center that has been saved \"not only from the standpoint of its reconstruction, but also financially, and its reputation\" contrasts with reporting from multiple news outlets that ticket sales and staffing both have sharply declined this year.The New York Times reported last month that internal figures showed ticket sales during a typical week in October down by about 50% from the same period a year earlier.The Washington Post, which analyzed sales data from early September through Oct. 19, found an \"across-the-board drop-off\" in ticket sales for the center's three largest performance spaces.Weeks after taking office, Trump named himself chairman of the Kennedy Center and terminated a slew of existing board members, saying they \"do not share our Vision for a Golden Age in Arts and Culture.\"He signaled in October that the name change was forthcoming.In a Truth Social post, Trump shared pictures of a newly painted colonnade on the outside of the building below a caption praising \"the new TRUMP KENNEDY, whoops, I mean, KENNEDY CENTER, columns.\"He nevertheless said later Thursday that he was \"surprised\" by the board's decision.\"I was honored by it. You know, we're saving the building,\" he told reporters in the Oval Office.The center was not initially named after Kennedy.It was created in 1958, when President Dwight Eisenhower signed legislation to \"provide for a National Cultural Center\" in Washington.In 1962, Eisenhower's successor, Kennedy, and first lady Jacqueline Kennedy led a $30 million fundraising campaign to build the center.Kennedy was assassinated in November 1963. Two months later, President Lyndon Johnson signed a law renaming the center in honor of the slain president.Trump has used the Kennedy Center extensively during the first year of his second presidential term.He attended a board meeting there in March, claiming the building was in \"tremendous disrepair.\" In June, he and first lady Melania Trump appeared for the opening night of the musical \"Les Miserables.\"This month, Trump took the unusual step of hosting the Kennedy Center Honors, where actors Sylvester Stallone and Michael Crawford, and musicians including Gloria Gaynor, George Strait and the members of '80s rock band Kiss, were saluted.Trump also attended the FIFA World Cup drawing at the center, where he was awarded the soccer organization's newly created \"peace prize.\"",

    "body": "watch nowThursday saw the release of a much lighter-than-expected consumer price report for November, breaking from the recent trend of sticky inflation.Stocks jumped. Yields fell. Odds of a Federal Reserve rate increased.And many economists scratched their heads.The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that the consumer price index had an annual inflation rate of 2.7% last month, while core CPI — a measure that excludes volatile food and energy prices — was even lower at 2.6%. Both were below what economists had been estimating, as those polled by Dow Jones called for an annual headline rate of 3.1% and a rate on core CPI of 3%. The November data release Thursday was delayed by 8 days because of the U.S. government shutdown, but more importantly, the October data was canceled, leaving it to the BLS to make certain methodological assumptions about the prior month's inflation levels.Those assumptions in the methodology were not clear to economists and were not fully explained in the release.\"The downside surprise reflects weakness in both goods and services, but may be partly due to methodological issues. The BLS might have carried forward prices in some categories, effectively assuming 0% inflation,\" Michael Gapen, chief U.S. economist at Morgan Stanley, said in a note, deeming the November reading as \"noisy\" in a way that's \"difficult to draw strong conclusions.\" \"If these technical factors are the main source of weakness, we could see reacceleration in December,\" Gapen added.The main issue: OEREconomists were zooming in on one particularly important subset in the data as problematic: owners' equivalent rent. This is a key part of calculating the inflation seen in the housing market.UBS economist Alan Detmeister said the price changes in October for the OER appear to have been \"set to zero.\"Evercore ISI's Krishna Guha, digging deeper, said it appears the BLS \"put in zero inflation in multiple categories\" while calculating the OER for the approximately one-third of cities used.\"To the extent that it introduces a downward bias, the Fed would be mindful of the risk of taking the data on housing services inflation at face value,\" he wrote in a Thursday note.Detmeister said the impact of this could linger for the next few months.\"This weakness should be reversed with very large OER and tenants' rents increases in the April CPI released in May, but until then the price levels for OER and tenants' rent will be biased downward,\" he said.Stephanie Roth of Wolfe Research estimated that the 0.13% rise in rent and 0.27% increase in OER across the two-month period comes out to a respective climb of about 0.06% and 0.13% month over month.CNBC has reached out to the BLS for comment.There were other issues as well.Roth noted that there was likely downward pressure on certain goods categories since the BLS's data collection period took place later in November, a time when there's \"more holiday discounting.\"\"The market seems to be taking the data as a dovish signal, but given the technical quirks we expect the Fed will put less weight on this reading,\" she said in a note to clients. \"While its positive inflation doesn't appear to be rising strongly on the back of tariffs, there will likely be a bounce back as the data normalizes after the shutdown-related volatility.\"To be sure, there was already some skepticism toward the report in the leadup to its release, with some on Wall Street raising concerns around bias due to impacts from the shutdown, which ended in mid-November.The enthusiasm on Wall Street that followed the release eased as the trading day continued. Stocks were off their highs, with technology stocks doing most of the heavy lifting and shares more linked to the economy, such as banks, in the red. Yields were off their lows as well.— With reporting by Steve Liesman",

Instead, the bloc agreed to raise money through joint borrowing backed by the EU budget. \"Ukraine will only repay this loan once Russia pays reparations,\" Costa said in a statement. \"The only way forward is a ceasefire and a negotiated peace. Our political and financial support to Ukraine will not falter.\"Under the Ukraine Facility and related programs, the EU has already delivered several tranches of financial assistance, including around 6 billion euros in bridge-financing, or short-term loans or advances provided to help Kyiv cover urgent budget needs. Ukraine has also received 18.1 billion euros in loans under a Group of Seven, or G7, led scheme this year. The agreement provides a  financial backstop for Ukraine, while underscoring Europe's push to shape U.S.-led peace negotiations to end Russia's conflict with Kyiv.Since the start of Russia's war against Ukraine in 2022, the European Union support to Kyiv has reportedly exceeded 187 billion euros.In late November, U.S. and Ukrainian officials met in Geneva to work on a refined peace framework aimed at narrowing disagreements over a U.S.-proposed plan to end the conflict. That plan, Reuters reported, would have included provisions on territory and security that reflected some Russian positions, including freezing current front-line control and recognizing changes to control over occupied areas, as well as measures affecting Ukraine's military and NATO aspirations, which Kyiv found difficult to accept.",

    "body": "Traders work on the floor at the New York Stock Exchange in New York City, U.S., Dec. 17, 2025.  Brendan McDermid | ReutersWall Street could be in for a volatile end to the week as traders brace for what Goldman Sachs says will be the largest options expiration on record.Options expiration days are a monthly occurrence on Wall Street when the contracts on short-term derivatives expire. Friday happens to be one of the rare times (four times a year) when options on four types of securities expire on the same day: index options, single stock options, index futures and index futures options. This is called a \"quadruple witching\" day.More than $7.1 trillion in notional options exposure is set to expire this Friday, according to Goldman, including roughly $5 trillion tied to the S&P 500 index and $880 billion linked to single stocks. December options expirations are typically the biggest of the year, but this one eclipses all prior records, the firm said.To put the scale into context, the options expiring Friday represent notional exposure equal to about 10.2% of the total market capitalization of the Russell 3000, Goldman said.That dynamic could lead to choppy trading, particularly around heavily watched levels in the S&P 500, according to Jeff Kilburg, founder and CEO of KKM Financial.\"I am expecting volumes to be well above normal as options traders finalize 2025 profits and losses,\" Kilburg said. \"But a lot of the repositioning seems to have already taken place. 6800 is a big strike price in the S&P and we will see if the bulls can defend that level after pushing the market back above it this morning.\"The S&P 500 is up about 15% this year, trading around 6,770 on Thursday. Stock Chart IconStock chart iconS&P 500 YTDWhile the broader market could have heightened volumes and volatility, some individual stocks with large open interest could see a different scenario. If options traders who hedge their positions are sitting on a large amount of at-the-money options, the activity tied to those contracts expiring can actually calm price swings rather than intensify them. Options that are \"at the money\" have strike prices that are equal to the current price of the underlying asset.As traders adjust their hedges, prices can get pulled toward heavily traded strike levels, a phenomenon known as a \"pin,\" leaving stocks hovering near key levels into the close, Goldman noted.\"This situation is often referred to as a 'pin' and can be an ideal situation for a large investor trying to enter/exit a stock position,\" Goldman said.Stocks with options expiring Friday that represent a large share of their typical daily trading volume — and could be prone to \"pinning\" — include GeneDx Holdings, BILL Holdings, Avis Budget Group and GameStop, the firm found.",

    "body": "Providence Police work the scene of a shooting in the area of Eddy Street and Sayles Street in Providence, Rhode Island, United States December 15, 2025. Kyle Mazza | Anadolu | Getty ImagesThe man suspected of the shooting at Brown University that killed two students and injured nine others last Saturday, and then of killing a Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor days later, was found dead from suicide on Thursday, authorities said.\"There's no longer a threat to the  public,\" the U.S. Attorney's Office in Boston said in a statement.The suspect in the shootings was identified as Claudio Manuel Nueves Valente, a 48-year-old Portuguese national who had been a graduate student in physics at Brown in the early 2000s.Authorities announced his identity and suspected role in the Brown shooting hours after his body was discovered in a storage unit in Salem, New Hampshire, with guns at the scene.Providence, Rhode Island, police had obtained a warrant for Valente's arrest charging him with two counts of murder, and multiple assault and firearms counts related to the shooting Saturday afternoon in an auditorium at Brown's Barus & Holley Building, where a group of students were taking an exam review for Principles of Economics.The MIT professor, Nuno Gomes Loureiro, 47, was found shot in his home in Brookline, Massachusetts, on Monday, and died at a hospital on Tuesday.Valente had been a PhD program student in physics at Brown.He is believed to have attended the same university in Lisbon, Portugal, as Loureiro, who  was a member of MIT's departments of nuclear science and engineering and physics.Valente is the \"individual we believe responsible for the Brown shooting,\" FBI Special-Agent-in-Charge Ted Docks said at a press conference in Providence.\"Many questions need to be answered,\" Docks said.Authorities believe Valente acted alone and that he eluded capture for days because he was traveling in a rental car whose license plates he kept changing. But authorities managed to track the rental, which was originally made in Boston, and were able to identify Valente through that, and to learn that he had rented the storage unit in Salem where he was found.Brown University President Christina Paxson said, \"It is safe to assume that this man, when he was a student, spent a lot of time in that building,\" Barus & Holley, where Saturday's shooting occurred.The last class he took at Brown was in 2001.Authorities said he is believed to have originally been in the United States on a student visa and obtained lawful permanent resident status in 2017.",

    "body": "The Bank of England (BOE) in the City of London, UK, on Monday, Dec. 15, 2025. Bloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesThursday's bonanza of four European central banks announcing interest rate decisions was as expected: the European Central Bank, Norges Bank, and Riksbank held their rates, while the Bank of England cut.But there were hints at what's ahead for 2026. Here are four key takeaways.1. The BoE voted to cut, but only justThe markets thought the BoE's rate cut was a done deal, with futures markets suggesting an almost 98% chance of one. But the vote to cut by 25 basis points was by the narrowest of margins: 5-4. A number of officials called for caution, citing continued risks to inflation.Rate setter Meghan Greene, who was among the four opposing a cut, argued there were signs inflation for services was at risk of spiking, while inflation for core goods remained at pre-Covid levels.Barclays U.K. Chief Economist Jack Meaning told CNBC the bank had delivered a \"hawkish cut,\" adding the bar could be higher for future cuts.watch now2. The ECB projections seem to justify the holdThe ECB's latest projections seem to have backed up European officials who have said rates are in a \"good place,\" with the growth outlook upgraded and inflation seen returning to the 2% target in 2028.President Christine Lagarde said the Eurozone's economy has been \"resilient\", while Al Cattermole, Mirabaud Asset Management fixed income portfolio manager, said the outlook was \"slightly hotter\" than expected, and means the committee will \"lean more towards that hawkish edge.\"3. But its next decision could be a hikeThe ECB leaving its policy rate unchanged came as little surprise to investors, with resilient economic data suggesting rates will remain on pause.But investors say that, by raising its growth outlook for the euro zone, the bank may have laid the groundwork for its next move to be a rate hike, as hinted at by governing member Isabel Schnabel.Schnabel told Bloomberg that she was \"rather comfortable\" with expectations that the next move could be a rate hike, \"albeit not any time soon.\"\"The prevailing narrative is that the rate-cutting cycle has largely run its course and that Europe's growth momentum now lies primarily in fiscal policy. Some even suggest that the ECB could begin raising policy rates again by the end of 2026,\" noted Kevin Thozet, a member of French asset manager Carmignac's investment committee.4. Don't expect Riksbank to move rates soonSweden's Riksbank boosted its economic outlook, now seeing 2.9% growth next year, compared to the 2.7% it previously expected.That has cemented expectations the central bank won't move rates anytime soon – with officials forecasting an eventual move higher after staying on hold throughout next year. Riksbank Governor Erik Thedéen told CNBC that Sweden is in \"a fairly good place,\" with growth picking up, while SEB Chief Economist Jens Magnusson said the country had \"one of the most promising growth cases for next year.\"",

    "body": "Samuel Boivin | Nurphoto | Getty ImagesTikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew told employees on Thursday that the company's U.S. operations will be housed in a new joint venture.The entity is named TikTok USDS Joint Venture LLC, according to a memo sent by Chew and obtained by CNBC. As part of the joint venture, Chew said the company has signed agreements with the three managing investors: Oracle, Silver Lake, and Abu Dhabi-based MGX. He said that the deal's \"closing date\" is Jan. 22.Under a national security law, which the Supreme Court upheld in January, China-based ByteDance was required to divest TikTok's U.S. operations or face an effective ban in the country. In September, President Donald Trump signed an executive order approving a proposed deal that would keep TikTok operational in the U.S. by meeting the requirements of a law originally signed by former President Joe Biden. Chew noted that the new TikTok joint venture would be \"majority owned by American investors, governed by a new seven-member majority-American board of directors, and subject to terms that protect Americans' data and U.S. national security.\"The U.S. joint venture will be 50% held by a consortium of new investors, including Oracle, Silver Lake and MGX, with 15% each. Just over 30% will be held by affiliates of certain existing investors of ByteDance, and almost 20% will be retained by ByteDance, the memo said.The TikTok chief said the entity will be responsible for protecting U.S. data, ensuring the security of its prized algorithm, content moderation and \"software assurance.\" In addition to being an investor, Oracle will serve as the \"trusted security partner\" in charge of auditing and validating that it complies with \"agreed upon National Security Terms,\" the memo said. Sensitive U.S. data will be stored in Oracle's U.S.-based cloud computing data centers, Chew wrote.Oracle shares were up 5% in after-hours trading on Thursday.The new TikTok entity will also be tasked with retraining the video app's core content recommendation algorithm \"on U.S. user data to ensure the content feed is free from outside manipulation,\" the memo said.Chew noted that TikTok global U.S. entities \"will manage global product interoperability and certain commercial activities, including e-commerce, advertising, and marketing.\"Under Trump's executive order in September, the attorney general was blocked from enforcing the national security law for a 120-day period in order to \"permit the contemplated divestiture to be completed,\" allowing the deal to finalize by Jan 23. President Trump said in September that Chinese President Xi Jinping agreed to move forward with the proposal. Vice President JD Vance noted that there was \"some resistance\" from the Chinese government to support the deal that he said valued TikTok's U.S. business at $14 billion.ByteDance said in a statement in September that it would \"work in accordance with applicable laws to ensure TikTok remains available to American users through TikTok U.S.\"\"We thank President Xi Jinping and President Donald J. Trump for their efforts to preserve TikTok in the United States,\" ByteDance said at the time.WATCH: TikTok signs deal for sale of U.S. unit to joint venturewatch now",

    "body": "A shopper carries Nike bags in San Francisco, California, US, on Wednesday, Dec. 17, 2025.  David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesNike on Thursday posted quarterly earnings and revenue that topped Wall Street's estimates, as strength in North America helped to offset a plunge in China sales.The company's stock slid about 10% in extended trading Thursday, as investors digested the weakness in China and the sustained hit Nike is taking from higher tariffs.Here's what Nike reported for its second fiscal quarter of 2026, according to consensus estimates from LSEG:Earnings per share: 53 cents vs. 38 cents expectedRevenue: $12.43 billion vs. $12.22 billion expectedThe athletic apparel retailer said sales in North America rose 9% to $5.63 billion. But revenue in its Greater China market dropped 17% to $1.42 billion.The sneaker company is just over a year into CEO Elliott Hill's turnaround strategy, focusing on regaining its growth and market share, clearing out old inventory and investing in wholesale relationships.\"Fiscal year '26 continues to be a year of taking action to rightsize our classics business, return Nike digital to a premium experience, diversify our product portfolio, deepen our consumer connection, strengthen our partner relationships and realign our teams and leadership,\" Hill said on a call with analysts. \"And I say we're in the middle inning of our comeback.\"\"We're nowhere near our potential,\" he added.Hill said Nike's improvements in its China market are \"not happening at the level or the pace we need to drive wider change,\" though he said the country remains one of the company's most powerful long-term opportunities.Nike expects fiscal third quarter revenues to fall by a low single digit percentage, with modest growth in North America. It also anticipates gross margins will drop 1.75 to 2.25 percentage points – including a 3.15 percentage point hit from tariffs.The company said wholesale revenues climbed 8% to $7.5 billion during the quarter. But direct sales — which were a focus for Nike in the years before Hill took over and moved away from the strategy — fell 8% to $4.6 billion.Nike has also been feeling the impact of tariff increases. It said Thursday that its gross margin decreased by 3 percentage points and inventories dropped 3% primarily due to higher tariffs.watch nowThe sneaker company has been reporting weakness in its Converse brand, too. In its first fiscal quarter, Nike said Converse sales dropped 27% – on Thursday, it reported a 30% drop in revenues for the sneaker brand. Despite the weakness in some parts of Nike's business, the company highlighted some areas of strength and new initiatives ahead. CFO Matt Friend said on the call that Nike.com posted its best Black Friday ever this year, partially driven by its Air Jordan \"Black Cat\" launch.Nike also plans to launch a new footwear platform in January called Nike Mind, which aims to help athletes prepare for performance and competition, Hill said on the call.Nike has been making larger internal changes under Hill.Earlier this month, Nike underwent leadership changes to \"remove layers,\" according to Hill. Under its \"Win Now\" strategy, the company announced that Chief Commercial Officer Craig Williams would leave the sneaker giant. Hill called the shakeup a move \"about growth and offense.\"\"Collectively, these changes amount to us eliminating layers and better positioning Nike to continue to have an impact the way only Nike can,\" Hill said in a statement at the time.Nike shares have dropped more than 13% this year as of Thursday's close.",

    "body": "U.S. President Donald Trump sits in the Oval Office to sign executive orders, at the White House in Washington, D.C., U.S., Dec. 18, 2025. Evelyn Hockstein | ReutersPresident Donald Trump signed an executive order Thursday directing federal agencies to reclassify marijuana, loosening long-standing restrictions on the drug and marking the most consequential shift in U.S. cannabis policy in more than half a century.The order, once finalized by the Drug Enforcement Administration, moves cannabis out of Schedule I classification — the most restrictive category under the Controlled Substances Act, alongside heroin and LSD — to a Schedule III classification, which encompasses substances with accepted medical use and a lower potential for abuse, such as ketamine and Tylenol with codeine.\"This action has been requested by American patients suffering from extreme pain, incurable diseases, aggressive cancers, seizure disorders, neurological problems and more, including numerous veterans with service-related injuries, and older Americans who live with chronic medical problems that severely degrade their quality of life,\" Trump said from the Oval Office on Thursday.  Also on Thursday, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, led by Dr. Mehmet Oz, is expected to launch a pilot program in April enabling certain Medicare-covered seniors to receive free, doctor-recommended CBD products, which must comply with all local and state laws on quality and safety, according to senior White House officials. The products must also come from a legally compliant source and undergo third-party testing for CBD levels and contaminants.Shares of cannabis conglomerates were down following the announcement, likely from worries of new compeititon from international companies.Trulieve's stock finished the day down about 23%, Green Thumb Industries fell more than 16% and Tilray Brands fell about about 4% as of close on Thursday. The AdvisorShares Pure US Cannabis ETF, which tracks American operators, slid almost 27%.\"Millions of registered patients across the United States, many of them veterans, rely on cannabis for relief from chronic and debilitating symptoms. We commend the administration for taking this historic step. This is only the beginning,\" Ben Kovler, founder and CEO of Green Thumb, said in a statement to CNBC. The reclassification is viewed by many analysts as a financial lifeline for the cannabis industry. The move exempts companies from IRS Code Section 280E, allowing them to deduct standard expenses like rent and payroll for the first time. It also opens the door for banking access and institutional capital previously sidelined by compliance fears. Many on Wall Street also expect the changes and the Medicare pilot to draw major pharmaceutical players into the sector to chase federally insured revenue.While CBD has surged in popularity in recent years, with infused consumer goods ranging from seltzers to skin care, the Food and Drug Administration has stopped short of granting the compound its full backing. Studies have found \"inconsistent benefits\" for targeted conditions, while FDA-funded research warns that prolonged CBD use can cause liver toxicity and interfere with other lifesaving medications. Currently, the FDA has only approved one CBD-based drug, Epidiolex, for rare forms of epilepsy.\"I want to emphasize that the order ... doesn't legalize marijuana in any way, shape or form, and in no way sanctions its use as a recreational drug,\" Trump said. Experts and industry insiders told CNBC this week that a reclassification could pave the way for more research into the effects of CBD use. ",

    "body": "The Eli Lilly & Co. logo at the company's Digital Health Innovation Hub facility in Singapore, on Thursday, Nov. 14, 2024.Ore Huiying | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesEli Lilly on Thursday said its closely watched obesity pill helped patients maintain the majority of their weight loss after they switched directly from taking the company's injection Zepbound and Novo Nordisk's rival shot Wegovy in a late-stage trial. The company also said it has filed for Food and Drug Administration approval of the daily GLP-1 pill, called orforglipron, for obesity. The FDA in November said it awarded a priority review voucher to that pill, which could expedite its review timeline to a few months. Shares of Eli Lilly rose more than 2% on Thursday after the announcement. The positive trial data suggests that the pill could be an effective treatment for patients to transition to if they want to preserve their weight loss but don't want to take weekly injections long term. Many people who stop those shots regain much of the weight they initially shed. While Eli Lilly's pill appears to cause less weight loss overall than existing injections, Thursday's results highlight its potential role as a needle-free maintenance treatment in the blockbuster GLP-1 market. But an oral pill for obesity from Novo Nordisk will likely enter the market first, giving the Danish drugmaker a head start in staking its claim in the space.The phase three trial followed more than 300 patients with obesity who previously took Wegovy or  Zepbound for 72 weeks in a separate late-stage study. Those people were then randomized to take either Eli Lilly's pill or a placebo for another 52 weeks. The oral drug met the trial's main goal of demonstrating superior weight loss maintenance compared with a placebo, among people who previously experienced a plateau in their progress while taking the injections. On average, patients who switched to the pill from Novo Nordisk's Wegovy only regained roughly 2 pounds of the weight they initially lost by the end of the trial. Meanwhile, on average, people who switched to the pill from Zepbound only regained around 11 pounds of the weight they initially lost by the end of the study. That means people in the Wegovy group maintained about 95% of their weight loss after switching, while those in the Zepbound group maintained roughly 80%. \"Obesity is a chronic, progressive disease, and sustaining weight loss remains a significant challenge for many,\" said Kenneth Custer, president of Lilly Cardiometabolic Health, in a release. He said the trial showed that the pill \"helped people maintain the weight they worked hard to lose\" and that, if approved, it could \"provide a convenient alternative for the millions of individuals living with obesity around the globe to continue their long-term health journey.\"While people in the Zepbound group appeared to regain more weight, the bigger focus is likely on those who transitioned from the drug's top competitor, Wegovy. In an October note, BMO Capital Markets analyst Evan Seigerman said positive results from the trial could give Eli Lilly \"the unique opportunity to capture revenue share\" from chronic treatment with semaglutide, the active ingredient in Novo Nordisk's Wegovy and diabetes injection Ozempic. \"Chipping away at the potential for Novo's flagship product,\" Seigerman wrote. In a note on Thursday, Leerink Partners analyst David Risinger said the data \"will help drive commercial success and upside to consensus expectations\" for Eli Lilly's pill. He said the firm expects the drug to rake in $2 billion in sales by the end of 2026, $9 billion by the end of 2027 and $16 billion by the end of 2028. Dr. Caroline Apovian, co-director of the Center for Weight Management and Wellness at Brigham and Women's Hospital, said the results were \"still great\" even though patients regained some of the weight they lost. But she said, \"in order for this to be a good switch, these orals are going to have to be less expensive for the insurance companies to cover than the injectables, right?\" Obesity injections currently carry list prices of roughly $1,000 per month before insurance, though both Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk have cut the direct-to-consumer prices of their drugs for cash-paying patients. It's unclear how the companies will price their respective pills. But under recent deals with President Donald Trump, the companies said starting doses of their upcoming oral drugs, pending approvals, will be $149 per month for everyone getting them through the direct-to-consumer website TrumpRx. That site launches in January. The overall safety and tolerability – or how well patients handle treatment – of the pill were consistent with previous late-stage studies. The most common side effects were gastrointestinal related and generally mild to moderate in severity. More CNBC health coverageThe Trump administration is changing Covid, childhood vaccine recommendations – here's what it means for youU.S. to impose 100% tariff on branded, patented drugs unless firms build plants locally, Trump saysEli Lilly to build $6.5 billion Texas manufacturing facility for obesity pill, other drugsAround 4.8% of people who switched to the pill from Wegovy discontinued treatment due to side effects, while 7.2% of those who switched to the oral drug from Zepbound did the same. Meanwhile, those rates were 7.6% and 6.3% among patients who switched to a placebo from Wegovy and Zepbound, respectively. No liver safety issues were observed, according to Eli Lilly. Full results of the trial, called ATTAIN-MAINTAIN, will be presented at an upcoming medical meeting and published in a peer-reviewed journal next year. Eli Lilly's pill works in a similar way to Wegovy, Ozempic and Novo Nordisk's diabetes pill Rybelsus, targeting a gut hormone called GLP-1 to suppress a person's appetite and regulate blood sugar. Novo Nordisk is also seeking approval of an oral version of Wegovy for obesity, which could come by year-end.But unlike those three treatments, Eli Lilly's pill is not a peptide medication. That means it is absorbed more easily by the body and does not require dietary restrictions like Rybelsus or oral Wegovy does.In a note in August, Goldman Sachs analysts forecast that pills will capture a 24% share — or around $22 billion — of the 2030 global weight loss drug market, which they expect to be worth $95 billion in total.They said they expect Eli Lilly's pill to have a 60% share — or roughly $13.6 billion — of the daily oral segment of the market in 2030. They expect Novo Nordisk's oral semaglutide to have a 21% share — or around $4 billion — of that segment.",

Nancy Mace, R-S.C., as she left a meeting with Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., and other Republicans like her who want a trading ban.Rep. Anna Paulina Luna, R-Fla., said, \"We will be getting a vote on the floor sometime in January … no more insider trading.\"Read more CNBC politics coverageTrump sues BBC for $10 billion, claims defamation from Panorama documentaryPentagon takes big stake in new Korea Zinc refinery in Tenn., gets 10% of companyNew Trump tariffs collection hits $200 billion, Customs saysFormer Instacart employee says she was fired over her Democratic congressional campaignUkraine peace talks progressing, Russia open to EU membership, U.S. officials sayNew York AG sues UPS for allegedly shorting Christmas season workers' wagesTrump admin to hire 1,000 specialists for 'Tech Force'Trump doubles down on Rob Reiner criticism after killing; director's son in custodyTSA is giving airline passenger data to ICE for deportation push: NYTTrump's AI order may be 'illegal,' Democrats and consumer advocacy groups claimTrump sued by preservation group seeking to halt White House ballroom projectTrump says 'no big deal' after new Epstein photos showing him releasedPutin can fund war for years, ex-official says as Trump's resolve is testedIndiana redistricting bill that Trump demanded defeated in state SenateHouse passes INVEST Act to ease investment standards, boost capital in marketsDOJ fails again to indict New York AG James, a Trump target: ReportsTrump 'sells out' U.S. national security with Nvidia chip sales to China: WarrenTrump pushes for top prosecutor nominee Halligan after Comey, James cases tossedTrump willing to seize more oil tankers off Venezuela coast: White HouseSeized tanker will go to U.S. port, Trump admin intends 'to seize the oil'GOP lawmakers seek Trump aid for agricultural equipment after tariff pressureTrump says Fed could have 'at least doubled' latest interest rate cut'Spoof' ship: Seized oil tanker hid location, visited Iran and VenezuelaTrump admin touts pulling 9,500 truckers off road for failing English testsSwiss government says new 15% U.S. tariff ceiling retroactive to mid-NovemberHomeland Security Dept. buying Boeing 737s for ICE deportationsTrump officials move to end student loan payment pause for millions of borrowersJudge unseals Ghislaine Maxwell grand jury materials, citing Epstein files actUkraine at 'critical moment' in war as European allies ramp up pressure on RussiaDemocrats establish AI working group as industry bolsters DC presenceEx-Trump lawyer Habba resigns as NJ U.S. attorney after disqualificationLeadership's commitment comes a day after House Democrats introduced their own proposal to ban lawmakers, as well as presidents and vice presidents, from owning or trading individual stock.The Democrats' maneuver risks derailing an effort that to date had been largely bipartisan.Rep. Seth Magaziner, D-R.I., who introduced that bill  with the backing of Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., said Democrats in the new year will file a discharge petition to force a vote on the bill. A discharge petition is a procedural tool that allows rank-and-file members to bypass leadership and force a vote if a majority of House members sign on. The tactic had been rarely used before this year.At a press conference Thursday, Jeffries said, \"There is absolutely no justification for the president, who has far more power than any individual member of Congress, or the vice president, to be able to trade stocks in real time when they have more access to inside information than perhaps the entire United States Congress combined.\"Luna, with the support of a bipartisan group of lawmakers, recently filed her own discharge petition on a separate proposal related to stock trading. The bill, subject to that petition, which was submitted by Magaziner and Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, would not include the executive branch.Seventy-four members had signed Luna's discharge petition as of Thursday.It is already illegal for members of Congress and the president to trade on inside information. But the law is rarely enforced, and the perception persists that lawmakers are profiting off information gleaned from their government positions.The issue gained increased attention in 2020, when a group of lawmakers made a series of trades at the outset of the Covid-19 pandemic. No member of Congress was charged for their trading activity at the time.More questions were raised earlier this year when some lawmakers, including then-Trump ally Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., purchased stocks just before Trump announced a pause on tariffs.Trump has supported a ban on members of Congress trading in individual stocks.But the president over the summer lashed out at Sen. Josh Hawley for that Missouri Republican's proposal that such a ban include the president. After that criticism, Hawley's bill was amended by the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee to say the trading ban would apply only to future presidents, not Trump. The committee advanced that bill with bipartisan support in July. The full Senate has yet to vote on it.The White House did not respond to a request for comment on Thursday.Johnson, the House speaker, has recently seen three discharge petitions succeed and force a vote over his objections.This week, House members obtained enough signatures for a petition to force a vote to extend enhanced Obamacare subsidies. That vote has yet to be held.And recently, they forced a floor vote mandating that the Department of Justice release files related to sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Those files are expected to be released on Friday.Luna said she would not drop her discharge petition even if Johnson allows a vote on a ban bill.Magaziner is encouraging members to sign both petitions.\"I am going to sign both discharge petitions, and I'm hopeful that one of them will get over the threshold to come to the floor,\" Magaziner said.",

    "body": "Chipotle will debut a High Protein Menu on Tuesday, December 23, with items ranging from 15 to 81 grams of protein per item.Source: Chipotle Mexican GrillChipotle Mexican Grill is entering the snack business.The fast-casual giant announced Thursday it will roll out its first-ever \"High Protein Menu\" later this month, featuring grab-and-go protein cups. Starting Tuesday, customers in the U.S. and Canada can buy a 4-ounce portion filled with adobo chicken or steak.The move is designed to re-energize demand as the chain known for massive burritos and bowls is grappling with slowing sales growth and a fundamental shift in how Americans eat.\"For years, guests have used Chipotle's customizable offerings to build high protein and fiber-filled meals on their own,\" Chris Brandt, Chipotle's president and chief brand officer, said in a release.The company recently cut its full-year same-store sales forecast for the third consecutive quarter, triggering a nearly 20% single-day stock selloff. Multiple Wall Street firms lowered their price targets, citing weakening traffic, most sharply among customers ages 25 to 35, and fading visibility into a rebound.Chipotle stock is down around 38% year-to-date. Across the fast-casual sector, inflation-weary consumers have been pulling back on dining out, and analysts have told CNBC previously that Chipotle is battling a value perception problem, with some diners lumping the chain in with pricier fast-casual rivals despite average entree prices that are closer to $10.Beyond the protein cup, the High Protein Menu includes entrees such as the Double High Protein Bowl and the High Protein-High Fiber Bowl, with items ranging from 15 to 81 grams of protein per serving. \"This curated menu brings that fan behavior to the forefront with clean ingredients and flexible portions, making protein and other dietary goals easier to reach in just a few taps,\" Brandt said. watch nowSmaller, protein-dense portions allow Chipotle to compete not just with other restaurants, but with protein bars, shakes and convenience-store snacks, while potentially capturing visits outside of lunch and dinner.High-protein diets have ranked as the top diet pattern in the U.S. for three consecutive years, according to Chipotle. About 70% of Americans now say they prioritize protein, and more than one-third have increased their intake over the past year, according to the International Food Information Council.  The launch also comes against the backdrop of a dramatic shift in consumer behavior driven by GLP-1 weight-loss drugs and growing interest in macronutrient tracking. GLP-1 users, in particular, tend to eat smaller amounts while emphasizing protein to preserve muscle mass — a trend that is forcing restaurant chains to rethink portion sizes, menu structure and pricing.Chipotle isn't alone in pivoting toward protein-forward offerings. Fast-casual salad chain Sweetgreen recently introduced new menu items following the trend, headlined by a bowl with 106 grams of protein. ",

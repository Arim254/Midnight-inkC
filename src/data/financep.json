    "body": "This story is part of CNBC Make It's Six-Figure Side Hustle series, where people with lucrative side hustles break down the routines and habits they've used to make money on top of their full-time jobs. Got a story to tell? Let us know! Email us at AskMakeIt@cnbc.com.When Tayo Lanlehin was planning her son's first birthday party in April 2022, she bought yellow and blue signs, balloons and a cake with 3D planets. Every detail fit the \"First Trip Around The Sun\" theme, except the chairs.She only found one rental seating option near her home in Oakland, California, she says: adult-sized white plastic chairs. She borrowed a picnic table with benches instead, and ruminated on the gap in the market for weeks. In May 2022, she sourced and spent roughly $2,000 on 48 kids' chairs from a manufacturer overseas, and stored them in her basement, says Tayo. Those chairs became Bay Area Kids Rentals, a side hustle that she runs with her husband Dolu Lanlehin. Now a full-fledged party rental business, the company has brought in over $295,000 in 2025 revenue as of Nov. 25, according to documents reviewed by CNBC Make It.Bay Area Kids Rentals has been profitable since the beginning, but the couple doesn't take an income from the side hustle, and is instead reinvesting those funds back into the business to expand its rental line, Dolu says. It now offers ball pits, mini bumper cars and multiple colors and styles of furniture. Tayo and Dolu's first party was for an event planner, who found the company on Instagram and requested pink chairs for a Barbie-themed party for her daughter in August 2022. She posted photos afterward on Instagram and the review led moms in Hillsborough, an affluent nearby town, to the business's social media accounts, Tayo says.Word-of-mouth \"spread like fire,\" and by October, Bay Area Kids Rentals was supplying decor for parties celebrating professional athletes' and Silicon Valley executives' children and grandchildren, she adds. The rapid success of the side hustle was initially \"a little jarring, because of the level of celebrity,\" Tayo says. \"My day job would end, then I'd go and work on parties for Silicon Valley CEOs' children.\"The couple works a combined eight hours per week running Bay Area Kids Rentals. Tayo, a strategic partnership principal at health-care company Blue Shield of California, oversees the side hustle's marketing and customer communication, and a portion of its work with manufacturers. Dolu — the head of product for Chegg Skills, part of education tech company Chegg — manages the company's accounting and finances.They outsource tasks like delivery, running painting and jewelry-making stations, and equipment maintenance to six contract employees, they say.Here's how Tayo and Dolu started their luxury party rental business, how they attracted high-profile clients and how their individual skillsets make them strong partners: CNBC Make It: Do you think the success of your side hustle is replicable? Dolu: 100%, but there would be some prerequisites. If someone is creative, detail-oriented and in a market somewhere in the world that supports this, I don't see anything stopping them. But Tayo does a nice job of seeing around the corner a little bit, staying connected to market trends and seeing where there are gaps. What kind of skillsets does someone need to run a luxury rental business? Tayo: [My inspiration] comes from a place of empathy. I'm a parent, so I'm always thinking operationally about [their experience], the services we can provide, having a website that is easy to book from, what we can do differently and more seamlessly than other companies. Bay Area Kids Rentals table and chairs at a Peppa Pig themed partyCourtesy of Bay Area Kids RentalsKids are so visual, too. I'm always thinking like, \"Wouldn't it make sense if a princess's birthday had cute pink chairs and a cute pink bounce house?\"  Dolu: Tayo is entrepreneurial, and I tend to be analytical because I come from consulting. I wanted to do market research, so we sent out a survey, just to get a signal. Other than a mortgage, kids are the biggest spending line item for parents. People are willing to be irritational for their kids and spend money they maybe don't even have ... because your kids tend to be the embodiment of your dreams, your visions that maybe you didn't get when you were younger.How did you attract ultra-wealthy, high-profile clients to Bay Area Kid Rentals?Tayo: We've had to do some marketing [and search engine optimization], but we really haven't been pressed because very early on starting this business, we hit our ideal client — with high net worth families and their event planners — like right away. I followed [NBA player] Andrew Wiggins' partner Mychal Johnson, and she had posted about one of her daughter's parties on Instagram. I did research and noticed that her next daughter's birthday was coming up in October [2022]. I direct messaged her with a link to our website saying, \"We have luxury kid party rentals, and we would love to be a part of your kid's birthday, if you're doing a party.\" She responded in 25 minutes and put us in touch with her event planner.We did four events for their family until they moved to Miami [in 2024].What makes ultra-wealthy clients different? What do they like about your services? Tayo: Flexibility and having limited touch points are very important in the luxury space. We don't send our rentals out for just four hours. We schedule our services around when the client wants to set up and tear down, when they want you to come and leave.Bay Area Kids Rentals table and chairs at a Barbie themed partyCourtesy of Bay Area Kids RentalsThey're not looking to go back and forth, either. A lot of our competitors will take deposits to make sure people don't damage their rentals. I don't do that — I just incorporate these costs into our pricing. That way, we don't have to have another conversation to process the payments and the refund.What's it like running this business together, in addition to your full-time job? Tayo: Running this business has given me some confidence that I'm building something of my own. I'm building something that could last and the potential of generational wealth. It's also just really nice to work with Dolu. This is like our third baby. Partnerships in business don't really work out a lot of the times, and the fact that we're married and raising kids on top of having a business, and we know how to resolve all kinds of issues, gives me the confidence that [our relationship] is going to be fine.Black Friday sale: Want to up your AI skills and be more productive? Get 25% off our most popular course of the year, How to Use AI to Be More Successful at Work, with coupon code GETSMART.

Innovator had $28 billion of assets under supervision across 159 ETFs as of Sept. 30.\"Active ETFs are dynamic, transformative, and one of the fastest-growing segments in today's public investment landscape,\" Goldman CEO David Solomon said in a news release announcing the deal. \"By acquiring Innovator, Goldman Sachs will expand access to modern, world-class investment products.\"Goldman Sachs, which has made asset and wealth management a priority since pivoting away from a consumer banking push, has made a series of deals in the sector this year.

    "body": "Disney's \"Zootopia 2\" follows detectives Judy Hopps and Nick Wilde find themselves on the twisting trail of a mysterious reptile who turns the mammal metropolis of Zootopia upside down.DisneyThe Thanksgiving box office had enough tasty options to deliver one of the best holiday performances ever.Led by Disney's \"Zootopia 2,\" which collected an estimated $156 million, the five-day Thanksgiving weekend secured around $294 million. That figure won't be finalized until Monday, when all of Sunday's ticket sales are calculated, but would represent either the third or fourth best Thanksgiving haul of all time.The fourth-highest Thanksgiving holiday box office is currently $291.3 million, which was generated in 2012 while the third-highest is 2013's $294.2 million haul, according to data from Comscore.While the 2025 Thanksgiving period at the box office was smaller than both 2018's $315.6 million haul and 2024's record-breaking $424.9 million, it still set records. IMAX reported its best five-day Thanksgiving holiday weekend ever with $40.8 million in global ticket sales, 70% higher than the previous record set during the same frame in 2024.\"'Zootopia 2' and 'Wicked: For Good' delivered a phenomenal one-two punch for the Thanksgiving holiday — hitting the sweet spot for family audiences and sending our global box office soaring well past expectations,\" Rich Gelfond, CEO of IMAX, said in a statement Sunday.Disney, too, hit several benchmarks.Largest animated box office ever \"Zootopia 2\" had the highest global opening of an animated movie of all time, with an estimated haul of $556 million. It is the fourth-highest global opening of all time, the company reported.\"A staggering global result for 'Zootopia 2' as the Disney brand coupled with a PG-rated family film extravaganza and a beloved original installment powered the film to over a half a billion dollars worldwide,\" said Paul Dergarabedian, head of marketplace trends at Comscore, told CNBC. \"This film truly cracked the code on what family audiences around the world [are] looking for when venturing out to cinemas.\"Additionally, the animated sequel posted the second-highest Thanksgiving day and Thanksgiving opening for both the five-day and three-day periods. The current record holder is 2024's \"Moana 2\" which tallied $221 million for the five-day Thanksgiving period and $135.5 million for the three-day.Universal's \"Wicked: For Good\" added an estimated $93 million to the domestic box office during the five-day Thanksgiving period, smaller than the $118 million \"Wicked\" picked up during the same period in 2024.Still, box office experts expected \"Wicked: For Good\" and \"Zootopia 2\" to continue to snap up ticket sales in the weeks before Christmas and ahead of the release of Disney's \"Avatar: Fire and Ash.\"\"This holiday weekend now sets the stage for a solid final home stretch of the box office year and with a great assortment of films on the way, including notable blockbusters and awards contenders ... this is a welcome result in the wake of what has been a very tumultuous post-summer season for the industry,\" Dergarabedian said.Disclosure: Comcast is the parent company of NBCUniversal, which owns CNBC. Versant would become the new parent company of CNBC upon Comcast's planned spinoff of Versant.",

The Office of Budget Responsibility (OBR) released its economic and fiscal forecasts on the budget's measures about 40 minutes before Chancellor Rachel Reeves was due to begin delivering it last Wednesday, sending yields on British government debt see-sawing.Richard Hughes, who took up the role as chair of OBR in October 2020, tendered his resignation after markets closed on Monday.In a letter addressed to Reeves and Dame Meg Hillier, a lawmaker who chairs parliament's Treasury Select Committee, Hughes said that the \"inadvertent early dissemination of our Economic and fiscal outlook on 26 November was a technical but serious error.\"The OBR has submitted a report to the Treasury and the Treasury Committee of the House of Commons detailing how and why the early release happened, and \"identifies the further actions the Office will take to ensure that it never happens again,\" the letter stated.\"It is in the best interest of the OBR for me to resign\" so the organization can \"quickly move on from this regrettable incident,\" Hughes wrote.\"By implementing the recommendations in this report, I am certain the OBR can quickly regain and restore the confidence and esteem that it has earned through 15 years of rigorous, independent, economic analysis,\" he added.Reeves responded by thanking Hughes \"for his public service and for leading the Office for Budget Responsibility over the past five years and for his many years of public service.\"\"This government is committed to protecting the independence of the OBR and the integrity of our fiscal framework and institutions,\" she added.",

    "body": "John Giannandrea.David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesApple's AI chief is stepping down, the company announced Monday in the most visible shake up yet to the iPhone maker's artificial intelligence group since launching its Apple Intelligence suite in 2024.John Giannandrea, who held the position since joining the company in 2018, will be replaced by Amar Subramanya, an AI researcher who most recently worked for Microsoft and was previously part of Google's DeepMind AI unit, according to his LinkedIn profile. Giannandrea was a senior vice president and reported to Apple CEO Tim Cook. He will continue to serve as an advisor until retiring next spring, Apple said.The change comes as experts this year have said Apple has fallen behind its tech peers in artificial intelligence, a tech field that has been reinvigorated since OpenAI launched ChatGPT in 2022.Apple Intelligence, which was intended to put Apple alongside AI leaders like OpenAI and Google, has not been well-reviewed by users and critics. Earlier this year, one of its most critical aspects, a significantly improved Siri assistant, was delayed until 2026, signaling development challenges. Subramanya will serve as Apple's vice president of AI, and will report to software chief Craig Federighi, the company said.In a statement, Cook said Federighi has already been playing a key role in Apple's AI efforts.\"In addition to growing his leadership team and AI responsibilities with Amar's joining, Craig has been instrumental in driving our AI efforts, including overseeing our work to bring a more personalized Siri to users next year,\" Cook said in a statement. Subramanya will lead teams working on Apple's foundation models, research and AI safety. Other teams previously under Giannandrea will move under COO Sabih Khan and services chief Eddy Cue, Apple said.Although Apple shares are up 16% in 2025, they have lagged many other big tech companies as investors say the iPhone maker has fallen behind its peers that are investing billions into AI data centers, chips and frontier models.Apple said in August that it was \"significantly increasing\" the amount it spends on AI, and Cook has said it's a \"profound\" technology. Apple has struck a deal with leader OpenAI to integrate ChatGPT into some of its products, like Siri.But Apple is playing a different game than companies like Microsoft, Google, and Meta. It's spending much less on infrastructure for the technology. Apple also prefers its AI to run on its devices, instead of communicating back to more powerful computers in the cloud.Apple this year also saw Jony Ive, its legendary hardware designer who helped late co-founder Steve Jobs invent the iPhone, sell his startup io for $6.4 billion to OpenAI, with the intention of helping the AI lab release its own hardware.Analysts say that Apple has built a loyalty moat among its customers since the iPhone launched in 2007, but AI-driven hardware is on its way, with Ive and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman last month saying that they've already completed their first prototypes and could reveal them in two years or less.WATCH: Apple will gain more AI functionality over time, says D.A. Davidson's Gil Luriawatch now",

Galaxy Z TriFold smartphone on display during a media preview in Seoul, South Korea, on Tuesday, Dec. 2, 2025.Bloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesLee added that Samsung's latest product is meant to test durability, hinge design and software performance while gathering real-world user insights before wider commercialization.The phone's three foldable panels can also run three apps vertically side by side, and offer a desktop-like mode without a separate display. The TriFold features Samsung's largest battery capacity among its foldable models and supports super-fast charging that reaches 50% in 30 minutes.TM Roh, who was recently appointed Samsung Electronics co-CEO and head of the Device eXperience division, said the Galaxy Z TriFold reflects years of work on foldable designs and aims to balance portability, performance and productivity in one device.Samsung was an early innovator of folding smartphones, unveiling its first foldable device in 2019. While the market has remained relatively small, new competitors have continued to enter, including Chinese brands that have proven competitive in both price and dimension.Visitors try out the Galaxy Z Trifold during Samsung Electronics' Galaxy Z TriFold media day at Samsung Gangnam in Seoul, South Korea, on Dec. 2, 2025. Anadolu | Anadolu | Getty ImagesIn September, telecommunications giant Huawei announced its second-generation trifold phone for the Chinese market, measuring 12.8 mm thick when folded.This year has also seen Chinese brands like Honor launch foldable smartphones in international markets. Honor was spun off from Huawei in 2020 in a bid to avoid U.S. sanctions and tap international markets.Like Samsung's other recent foldables, the TriFold is rated IP48, meaning it is water-resistant up to 1.5 meters for up to 30 minutes but offers limited dust protection.",

    "body": "U.S. President Donald Trump speaks to reporters during travel to Washington, D.C., from Palm Beach International Airport, Florida, U.S., November 30, 2025. Anna Rose Layden | ReutersPresident Donald Trump underwent an MRI in October to evaluate his cardiovascular and abdominal health, and the resulting images were \"perfectly normal,\" the White House physician said Monday.The results of Trump's magnetic resonance imaging were released a day after the 79-year-old president told reporters that he had \"no idea\" which part of his body was scanned, and three days after Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz responded to Trump calling him \"seriously r-----ed\" by saying, \"release the MRI results.\"\"Has anyone in the history of the world ever had an MRI assigned to them and have no idea what it was for, as he says?\" Walz said Sunday on NBC's \"Meet the Press.\"Trump's physician, Dr. Sean Barbabella, said Monday that the advanced imaging at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center was part of a \"comprehensive executive physical, and was ordered because men in his age group \"benefit from a thorough evaluation of cardiovascular and abdominal health.\" Barbabella described the imaging as routine and preventative, meant to identify potential issues early and confirm overall function. Barbabella also said the cardiovascular imaging showed no signs of arterial narrowing, impaired blood flow, or abnormalities in the heart or major vessels.Barbabella found that the heart chambers were normal in size, the vessel walls appeared smooth and healthy, and there was no indication of inflammation or clotting. The doctor also reported that all major organs appeared healthy and well-perfused, with no acute or chronic concerns detected.Barbabella described the president's cardiovascular system as being in \"excellent health.\" The White House did not release images of the tests.Until Monday, the White House had only described Trump's Walter Reed visit as a \"follow-up evaluation\" that included \"advanced imaging,\" without saying why the procedure was done.",

    "body": "A shopper exits a Costco store in Centerville, Ohio, US, on Tuesday, Oct. 21, 2025. Kyle Grillot | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesCostco sued the Trump administration to get a full refund of new tariffs it paid so far this year, and to block those import duties from continuing to be collected from the retail warehouse club giant as a Supreme Court case plays out.In the suit filed Friday, Costco said that it risks losing the money it has already paid to satisfy the tariffs even if the Supreme Court eventually upholds earlier lower court rulings that found President Donald Trump did not have the legal power to impose those duties.The company noted a looming Dec. 15 deadline that could prevent the tariffs that it has already paid on an estimated basis from being refunded. Costco did not say how much money it believes should be refunded to the company.Costco's suit, filed in the U.S Court of International Trade, said that U.S. Customs and Border Protection denied the company's request to extend the Dec. 15 date of so-called liquidation, the final computation of tariffs assessed on imported items. While an importer has six months to file a protest contesting liquidation, \"not all liquidations are protestable,\" the suit said.Dozens of other companies have filed similar lawsuits to protect their right to potential refunds in case the Supreme Court rules against the so-called reciprocal tariffs that Trump imposed on imports from many U.S. trading partners and his so-called fentanyl tariffs on products from Canada, China, and Mexico.Trump invoked the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to impose those often high tariffs. In August, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, in a 7-4 ruling, upheld a prior decision by the Court of International Trade that found Trump did not have that power.\"The core Congressional power to impose taxes such as tariffs is vested  exclusively in the legislative branch by the Constitution,\" the Federal Circuit said in its ruling. \"Tariffs are a core Congressional power.\"During oral arguments on Nov. 5, a majority of the Supreme Court's nine justices appeared skeptical of arguments by a lawyer for the Trump administration that the president did have the power to impose the tariffs.The Supreme Court took the administration's appeal of the lower court rulings on an expedited basis, but it is not clear when or how the court will decide the dispute.Costco, in its lawsuit, said, \"This separate action is necessary, however, because even if the IEEPA duties and underlying executive orders are held unlawful by the Supreme Court, importers that have paid IEEPA duties, including Plaintiff, are not guaranteed a refund for those unlawfully collected tariffs in the absence of their own judgment and judicial relief.\"Read more CNBC politics coverageJudge dismisses James Comey and Letitia James cases over 'unlawful' prosecutor appointmentSen.

Kevin Carter | Getty ImagesShares of European aerospace giant Airbus fell as much as 10% on Monday, following reports the company has discovered an industrial quality issue regarding dozens of A320-family aircraft. The flaw, which is said to affect the aircraft's fuselage panels, is delaying some deliveries but there are no immediate indications that it has reached aircraft in service, Reuters reported, citing unnamed sources. In response, Airbus confirmed it had identified a quality issue regarding a \"limited number\" of A320 metal panels, saying the source of the issue has been \"identified and contained.\" CNBC has contacted Airbus for comment. Paris-listed shares of Airbus plunged to the bottom of the pan-European Stoxx 600 index on the news. The stock was preliminarily 5.8% lower after the closing bell on Monday, paring losses from earlier in the session.The latest report comes after Airbus said the vast majority of the roughly 6,000 A320-family aircraft impacted by a software glitch over the weekend had now received the necessary modifications.In a statement published Monday, Airbus apologized for delays caused to passengers and airlines impacted by the software issue, which affected more than half of the narrow-body fleet and forced airlines to ground jets during one of the busiest travel weekends of the year.watch nowThe directive — among the largest in the 55-year history of Airbus — quickly spilled into U.S. holiday travel and stretched to Australia. The disruption, linked to solar flares, hit especially hard in Asia, where the single-aisle A320 family anchors short-haul networks.American Airlines and Delta Air Lines, which were both impacted by the Airbus recall, traded 0.2% lower and 0.3% higher, respectively. Meanwhile, shares of French aerospace and defense firm Thales, which supplied the flight system software to Airbus, were last seen down 2%. — CNBC's Victor Loh contributed to this report.",

Trump last month appeared to soften his stance on H1-B visas, saying in an interview to Fox News that foreign labor was needed at times because U.S. did not have \"certain talents.\" \"I'm certainly not in the school of thought that we should shut down the H-1B program,\" Musk said, adding that it would be \"very bad.\" watch nowMusk, whose relationship with the U.S. president appears to be on the mend having soured in May over Trump's spending bill, also raised concerns over the U.S. administration's tariff policy.

You can't legislate energy.\" Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have seen a sharp sell-off over the past two months as investor mood sours on digital assets.",

    "body": "watch nowEli Lilly on Monday said it is lowering the cash prices of single-dose vials of its blockbuster weight loss drug Zepbound on its direct-to-consumer platform, LillyDirect, building on efforts by the company and the Trump administration to make the medicine more accessible.The announcement also comes weeks after chief rival Novo Nordisk unveiled additional discounts on the cash prices of its obesity and diabetes drugs. Starting Monday, cash-paying patients with a valid prescription can get the starting dose of Zepbound vials for as low as $299 per month on LillyDirect, down from a previous price of $349 per month. They can also access the next dose, 5 milligrams, for $399 per month and all other doses for $449 per month, down from $499 per month across those sizes. Zepbound carries a list price of roughly $1,086 per month. That price point, and spotty insurance coverage for weight loss drugs in the U.S., have been significant barriers to access for some patients. The Eli Lilly logo appears on the company’s office in San Diego, California, U.S., Nov. 21, 2025.Mike Blake | ReutersEli Lilly's announcement comes just weeks after President Donald Trump inked deals with Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk to make their GLP-1 drugs easier for Americans to get and afford. The agreements will cut the prices the government pays for the drugs, introduce Medicare coverage of obesity drugs for the first time for certain patients and offer discounted medicines on the government's new direct-to-consumer website launching in January, TrumpRx. But Eli Lilly's deal with Trump centers around lowering the prices of a different form of Zepbound – a multi-dose pen – after it wins Food and Drug Administration approval. That means Eli Lilly's Monday announcement around cutting prices on the existing single-dose vials could allow more patients to get discounted treatments more quickly. \"We will keep working to provide more options — expanding choices for delivery devices and creating new pathways for access — so more people can get the medicines they need,\" said Ilya Yuffa, president of Lilly USA and global customer capabilities, in a statement. Eli Lilly's stock, which has climbed more than 36% this year, fell nearly 2% on Monday. Its meteoric rise due to the success of Zepbound and its diabetes injection Mounjaro vaulted it to becoming the first health-care company to hit a $1 trillion market value last month. Though cutting prices means lower revenue per medication sold, Eli Lilly's sales — and shares — have continued to soar through past pricing announcements as demand balloons.With single-dose vials, patients need to use a syringe and needle to draw up the medicine and inject it into themselves. Eli Lilly first introduced that form of Zepbound in August 2024. It's unclear how many patients are currently using single-dose vials of Zepbound. But Eli Lilly previously said that direct-to-consumer sales now account for more than a third of new prescriptions of Zepbound. Novo Nordisk earlier this month lowered the price of its obesity drug Wegovy and diabetes treatment Ozempic for existing cash-paying patients to $349 per month from $499 per month. That excludes the highest dose of Ozempic. The company also launched a temporary introductory offer, which will allow new cash-paying patients to access the two lowest doses of Wegovy and Ozempic for $199 per month for the first two months of treatment. ",

    "body": "Alina Habba, speaks after being sworn in as US Attorney General for New Jersey, in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington, DC, on March 28, 2025.Saul Loeb | Afp | Getty ImagesAlina Habba, President Donald Trump's pick to serve as New Jersey's top federal prosecutor, remains disqualified from serving in that role in either a permanent or acting capacity, a U.S. appeals court ruled Monday.The ruling from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit is the latest judicial rebuke to the Trump administration's efforts to quickly install its preferred candidates in powerful law-enforcement jobs.A three-judge panel, in a 32-page opinion, unanimously upheld an Aug. 21 ruling from a lower federal court that Habba was unlawfully serving as acting U.S. Attorney for the District of New Jersey.\"It is apparent that the current administration has been frustrated by some of the legal and political barriers to getting its appointees in place,\" Circuit Judge D. Michael Fisher wrote in the appellate ruling. The unusual series of legal moves taken by the Department of Justice to install Habba, one of Trump's former personal lawyers, as an acting U.S. attorney demonstrates \"the difficulties it has faced,\" Fisher wrote.\"Yet the citizens of New Jersey and the loyal employees in the U.S. Attorney's Office deserve some clarity and stability,\" the judge wrote.Fisher and another judge on the panel, D. Brooks Smith, were nominated to the Third Circuit by Republican former President George W. Bush. The other judge, L. Felipe Restrepo, was nominated by Democratic ex-President Barack Obama.Abbe Lowell and Gerald Krovatin, lawyers for one of the parties in the case challenging Habba's appointment, noted in a statement with Norm Eisen that Monday's ruling marks \"the first time an appellate court has ruled that President Trump cannot usurp longstanding statutory and constitutional processes to insert whomever he wants in these positions.\"\"We will continue to challenge President Trump's unlawful appointments of purported U.S. Attorneys wherever appropriate,\" the lawyers said in a joint statement.Read more CNBC politics coverageJudge dismisses James Comey and Letitia James cases over 'unlawful' prosecutor appointmentSen.

Trump nominated her in June, but she never underwent the Senate confirmation process, a Constitutionally-mandated step that can be lengthy and contentious.Habba could only legally serve as an interim prosecutor for a limited time under the Federal Vacancies Reform Act. As that deadline neared, the Trump administration took a number of steps to keep Habba in the role.The DOJ fired Desiree Grace, who was set to become interim U.S. attorney for the district after Habba's scheduled departure. Trump then withdrew Habba's nomination, and Bondi appointed her as both \"Special Attorney\" to the attorney general and the First Assistant U.S. attorney, aiming to elevate her automatically to acting U.S. attorney.But the appeals court panel ruled Monday that those actions failed to comply with the provisions of the FVRA.\"Therefore, we will affirm the District Court's disqualification order,\" Fisher concluded.The ruling came one week after another Trump-picked prosecutor, Lindsey Halligan, was deemed invalidly appointed.That ruling, which disqualified Halligan as interim U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, also threw out the cases she brought against two major Trump foes: former FBI Director James Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James.Monday's appellate ruling on Habba did not dismiss the underlying criminal charges against the two people who had challenged her appointment.",

On average, these billionaires are worth $2.2 billion each.Despite Europe as a whole seeing a declinPhoto: Ingolf Pompe | LOOK-fotoSwitzerland has long been a haven for the ultra-rich. Its 300 wealthiest residents are worth a combined 850 billion Swiss Francs, or just over $1 trillion, according to business magazine Bilanz.So it was perhaps unsurprising that a new inheritance tax was resoundingly rejected by voters on Sunday. The proposal to tax every inheritance and gift of more than 50 million Swiss Francs at 50% was defeated with 78% voting against it. Powerful Swiss business lobby Economiesuisse called talk of the inheritance tax a \"superfluous and damaging discussion.\"It welcomed the proposal's defeat, saying: \"The threat of forced sales of companies and the resulting weakening of the business location have convinced those entitled to vote from all political camps.\"The proposal came from the youth wing of the country's left-wing Social Democrats. Money raised from the tax would have been earmarked to fund policies to combat climate change, with the party saying it would \"channel billions into climate protection every year while simultaneously combating extreme wealth inequality.\"watch now'The ultra wealthy are like queens on a chessboard'Before the vote, close followers of the debate told CNBC the initiative, first proposed in 2024, had already shaken wealthy individuals and family-owned companies. Swiss billionaire Peter Spuhler, founder and owner of Stadler Rail, had threatened to leave the country if the tax became law. He told Swiss daily Tagesanzeiger that his family would struggle to pay such a tax as their wealth is tied up in companies.\"A lot of people who would be affected talked to their consultants and their tax lawyers, and they did the paperwork to be sure that this time of the year, a week before the final vote, they are ready to move out if necessary,\" Stefan Legge, from the University of St. Gallen in Switzerland told CNBC on Friday.Legge, who conducted research into the potential impact of the tax, said: \"If you target the super wealthy, they are like queens on a chessboard.\" watch now\"They are very mobile. They have tons of options to optimize their taxes,\" he added.Kurt Moosmann, president of the Swiss Single Family Office Association, told CNBC the proposal had caused \"a certain uncertainty among family offices and has kept foreign capital holders away from Switzerland.\"One potential impact of the 50% tax, if implemented, would have been a fall in tax revenue, according to  Legge. He said that around 2,000 people, or 0.3% of Switzerland's population, would be affected and they currently pay between 5 and 6 billion Swiss Francs a year.But although Switzerland faces competition from wealth centers in the Middle East and other countries in Europe, Legge said Switzerland was \"still very strong\" on \"finding the right balance between taxes and the right public services.\"watch nowGiorgio Pradelli, CEO of Swiss private bank EFG International, agreed that Switzerland remains in a strong position. \"If you look at the overall competitive landscape, Switzerland remains the No. 1 destination for international private banking and wealth management,\" he told CNBC last week. \"We have an ecosystem that is super healthy and strong.\"",

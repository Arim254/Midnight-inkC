    "body": "Most people have a relatively consistent wakeup time. Fewer have a set bedtime, which could be the reason you feel lacking in free time during the day, says author and time management expert Laura Vanderkam.The logic works like this: Without consistent sleep habits, most people can be generally productive but struggle to stay consistently focused all day, every day. Without consistent focus, your task list can build up, leading you to frantically rush to get things done. And when you're rushing, you make mistakes. Now the time you intended on saving is being spent backtracking or playing catch up.\"The problem is that people will get enough sleep over the course of a week overall, but it's very disordered,\" says Vanderkam, who's written eight books about time management. \"One night, you're staying up too late and getting up too early in the morning. The next night, somebody's crashing on the couch ... and weekends are all over the map.\"In spring 2021, Vanderkam surveyed over 150 participants who spent nine weeks implementing nine preset rules for productivity, including sticking to a consistent bedtime. \"One of the people in my study called [setting a bedtime] the least sexy, but the most impactful rule of all of them,\" says Vanderkam. A July 2025 study published to Nature, a peer-reviewed medical journal, came to a similar conclusion. Researchers observed over 79,000 working adults in Japan and found that irregular bedtimes were linked to lower productivity and more disengagement at work. A bedtime \"gives shape to the entire day,\" Vanderkam says, adding that it helps you know how many hours you have to work with each day, which helps you schedule your time more effectively. \"We know the day has a beginning — people are a lot fuzzier on this notion that each day has an end, but it does. And everything you're going to do has to fit within that time. It's kind of a puzzle.\"Vanderkam set an 11 p.m. bedtime for herself years ago, and says the routine \"allows me to make more rational choices about what is actually going to fit in my day.\"Disordered sleep can also negatively impact your circadian rhythm, or your body's innate sleep-wake pattern, Rachel Salas, a sleep neurologist and professor at Johns Hopkins University, told CNBC Make It in July 2022. To find yours, observe what time your body naturally wakes up without an alarm for a few days, and make 30-minute adjustments if you need to, Salas recommended.\"Sleep is a basic human need, and a lot is at stake if we don't get enough of it: our cognition, our memory, our digestion,\" said Salas. \"I can't think of one thing sleep isn't important for.\"Most adults need around seven hours of sleep per night, according to the Mayo Clinic, but sleep experts typically say that each person tends to need a different amount. Once you determine how much sleep helps you feel mentally sharp each day, use that figure to reverse-engineer your ideal bedtime, Vanderkam advises.\"Look at what time you have to wake up, count back the number of hours that you need to sleep, and we have a bedtime,\" says Vanderkam. Want to improve your communication, confidence and success at work?

    "body": "Engineering majors earn some of the highest salaries right after college — and they're still near the top years later.That's according to the latest findings from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, based on 2024 U.S. Census data, the most recent available.The analysis breaks down annual earnings for college graduates by major and reflects the income of full-time workers whose highest degree is a bachelor's, excluding currently enrolled students. Various engineering degrees have consistently ranked among the top-paying fields in recent years.The highest-paying majors for workers ages 22 to 27 are computer engineering, computer science and chemical engineering, with recent graduates earning median early-career salaries of $85,000 or more. That's well above the U.S  median personal income of just over $45,000, according to U.S. Census Bureau data. However, engineering accounts for about 6% of bachelor's degrees awarded nationwide, representing a relatively small share of all college graduates, according to the most recent data from the National Center for Education Statistics.Here are the 18 majors that lead to the highest salaries for workers ages 22 to 27:Computer engineering: $90,000Computer science: $87,000Chemical engineering: $85,000Aerospace engineering: $85,000Industrial engineering: $83,000Electrical engineering: $82,000Mechanical engineering: $80,000Construction services: $75,000Civil engineering: $75,000General engineering: $75,000Miscellaneous engineering: $75,000Economics: $72,000Business analytics: $72,000Finance: $70,000Mathematics: $70,000Nursing: $70,000Mathematics: $70,000Finance: $70,000Engineering graduates remain in strong demand for their mix of mathematical skills and technical expertise, which are valuable across a wide range of industries, data from the National Association of Colleges and Employers shows.While artificial intelligence is reshaping how the technical work is done, employment in many engineering fields is still projected to grow over the next decade, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.Engineering also tends to pay well over time. Among graduates ages 35 to 45, every engineering major reports median pay of at least $100,000. Here are all of the majors with mid-career median earnings of $100,000 or more, according to the New York Fed.Chemical engineering: $135,000Computer engineering: $131,000Aerospace engineering: $130,000Electrical engineering: $123,000Computer science: $120,000Mechanical engineering: $120,000Construction services: $120,000Civil engineering: $115,000Economics: $115,000Finance: $112,000Business analytics: $109,000General engineering: $105,000Miscellaneous engineering: $105,000Physics: $105,000Engineering technologies: $104,000Industrial engineering: $100,000Mathematics: $100,000Information systems: $100,000Marketing: $100,000Biochemistry: $100,000Political science: $100,000In contrast, education and arts majors tend to earn significantly less overall. By ages 35 to 45, six fields of education majors report median earnings below $60,000, placing them among the lower-paid fields in the study.Want to improve your communication, confidence and success at work?

(Photo by Prakash SINGH / AFP) (Photo by PRAKASH SINGH/AFP via Getty Images)Prakash Singh | Afp | Getty ImagesIndia's trade negotiators will reschedule their planned visit to Washington, D.C., aimed at firming up an interim trade deal with the U.S., a person familiar with the development told CNBC.The development comes after the U.S. Supreme Court struck down U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs as illegal on Friday. Within hours, Trump invoked Section 122 of the Trade Act of 1974 to first impose a 10% global import tariff, before increasing that to 15%.The \"meeting will be rescheduled at a mutually convenient date,\" the source told CNBC Sunday. India and the U.S. are of the view that the visit \"be scheduled after each side has had the time to evaluate the latest developments and their implications.\"CNBC has reached out to India's Ministry of Commerce and Industry for a comment.India's chief negotiator, Darpan Jain, and his team were scheduled to start the three day-meeting in the U.S. later this week.India is currently facing a 25% reciprocal tariff, which was due to be cut to 18% after the two sides agreed to an interim deal earlier this month, with room for alterations.\"In the event of any changes to the agreed-upon tariffs of either country, the United States and India agree that the other country may modify its commitments,\" read the joint statement issued on Feb. 6, by the U.S. and India.At this stage, it appears that India, like other countries, will be facing a 15% tariff in addition to the most-favored-nation status rates (usually around 2-3%), said Ajay Srivastava, founder of the Global Trade Research Initiative and a former Indian trade negotiator.Rethinking strategySince the Feb. 6 announcement, both sides had been meeting virtually to discuss the path forward, according to a local media report. The in-person meetings, planned for this coming week, with the U.S. Trade Representative, Ambassador Jamieson Greer, were seen as the precursor to the finalization of the legal text of the agreement between India and the U.S.India's Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal said Friday that the interim trade agreement between the two nations would likely be signed in March and implemented in April.\"The 18% tariff negotiations were based on a certain premise of some benefits which is now gone. Now, both sides have to rethink their strategy, and the U.S. has to deal with more pressing issues,\" Srivastava said.",

    "body": "Hyperscalers are significantly ramping up their AI capex spending — and increasingly using credit markets to fund it.  But investors say this shift is challenging mega-cap tech giants' so-called 'fortress balance sheet' status, and rips up what they call the \"unspoken contract\" that kept speculative AI spending largely separate from debt markets.After Amazon, Meta and Google-owner Alphabet all unveiled sizable increases in their full-year capex spending plans during earnings season, UBS data indicates that aggregated capex spend among AI hyperscalers could top $770 billion in 2026 — some 23% higher than previously expected.In a Feb. 18 note, UBS credit strategists said such increases imply a $40 billion to $50 billion ramp-up in borrowing from hyperscalers, pushing public market debt issuance to between $230 to $240 billion this year.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconOracle.Al Cattermole, fixed income portfolio manager at Mirabaud Asset Management, said this tilt toward the bond market is dramatically shifting the dynamic between hyperscalers and investors.\"For years, we've been told this AI spend would be funded by generated cash flow — that it is equity risk, it is speculative, and not to worry about it from a credit point of view,\" Cattermole told CNBC in an interview.\"There now seems to be a change in the unspoken contract that while we would continue to lend to these businesses, really AI capex was still going to be equity or cash funded….By bringing capex spend into the debt markets, you now have the question of credit worthiness.\"'Break point'Last September, Oracle tapped the bond market for some $18 billion in one of the biggest debt issuances on record. Others have rapidly followed, with Google-owner Alphabet recently issuing some $20 billion in debt, including a rare 100-year sterling-denominated bond. That's placing the sector's debt load under sharper scrutiny.\"Everyone had been treating these AA- or A-rated tech companies as essentially cash-plus. Then, suddenly, to be putting this amount of debt on the balance sheet, that's been quite the turn,\" Cattermole said. \"It's only been three or four months since we've had this turn — everyone's getting used to it in a new way.\"Investors now see trouble up ahead. BlackRock said mega-cap tech companies are using the current credit issuance \"bonanza\" to bridge the gap between current investment and future revenues.\"The problem: rising corporate borrowing adds supply to bond markets struggling to digest large public deficits,\" BlackRock said in its weekly market commentary.watch now\"What has changed is the market's focus: it now asks how AI adoption will translate into revenues and profits. This sorting of winners and losers means it's prime time for active investing,\" BlackRock added.The world's largest asset manager noted that AI builders have largely tapped the U.S. investment grade market, \"so we prefer high yield and European bonds.\"As Oracle's share price has trended lower over the past six months, credit default swaps on its bonds — which offer protection in the event of a borrower being unable to repay its debt — have seen sharp bouts of volatility.Cattermole, meanwhile, pointed to Alphabet's planned capex of almost 50% of its revenue for next year, which he said was approaching an \"unheard-of level.\"\"You wouldn't see that for a normal company at any point in time,\" he added. \"We are very clearly at a break point in natural cycles.\"'Hidden risks'Underlining concerns over a potential debt-fueled AI overspend, investors fear that the huge data centers that are key to the buildout could be rendered obsolete by rapid technical improvements that make chips more efficient and reduce demand for capacity. That carries far-reaching implications for debtholders, according to Cattermole.\"What if, in three years, these Nvidia chips get outstripped by a Chinese competitor, and I'm lending for five or eight years, and in year three, my data center is obsolete?\" he said.Shaan Raithatha, senior economist at Vanguard, said AI hyperscalers are starting from a very strong position, boasting \"strong balance sheets, strong free cash flow generation, and strong moats\" — but he acknowledged that they are now taking on more leverage.\"Are there hidden risks building in the system, whether it's special purpose vehicles, the greater leasing of assets, greater off-balance sheet activity? The hidden risks are building, we don't know if that's ever going to come up,\" Raithatha told CNBC's \"Squawk Box Europe\" on Wednesday.\"But, clearly, investors have to be mindful of that when they start to discount stock market returns into the future.\"—CNBC's Michael Bloom contributed to this report.",

    "body": "Gregory Beard, director of the Department of Energy's Office of Energy Dominance Financing.Courtesy: U.S. Department of EnergyFormer Apollo executive and longtime New Yorker Gregory Beard says he wouldn't have left the private sector for just any job. But opportunity came knocking in the form of Energy Secretary Chris Wright, who tapped Beard to run the Office of Energy Dominance Financing.Previously known as the Loan Programs Office and part of the Energy Department, the EDF is the largest energy lender in the world, with some $289 billion in loan authority currently.Beard first joined the EDF as a senior advisor in April 2025 from bitcoin miner Stronghold Digital Mining, before officially taking over as director on Jan. 29.\"If I didn't feel passionately about Secretary Wright's message and why the president chose him, I'd still be in the private sector,\" Beard said in an exclusive conversation with CNBC. Beard has only been at the helm for a few weeks, but he has big plans for the agency, including dispensing capital at a record rate. And at a time when the energy complex is seeing a generational shift and natural resources increasingly drive geopolitics, the EDF can be a key tool in shaping the future of energy in the U.S.Shaking up the officeBeard says the first order of business was to reexamine the loans granted during the Biden administration, the majority of which were approved in the months between Election Day 2024 and the inauguration. The result of the \"turnaround job,\" as he called it, impacted more than 80% of the Biden-era portfolio, or about $83.6 billion worth of loans, according to the Department of Energy. Most were focused on emissions-reducing projects.The review process included making sure projects that stayed in the portfolio align with the Trump administration's energy goals, Beard said. All told, roughly $30 billion in conditional loan commitments were either canceled or withdrawn by the applicant, with about $53 billion worth of loans restructured, the DOE said.The goal was to protect taxpayers, and to focus on affordability and reliability, Beard said. \"This is not a reversal of policies — it's a protection of dollars,\" he said. Solar panels at the Boulder Solar 1 facility in Boulder City, Nevada, Nov. 23, 2025.Daniel Cole | ReutersThe EDF dates back to 2005. The agency has acted as a bridge of sorts for U.S. companies that might struggle to secure financing via traditional capital markets due to perceived risks. In theory, the rigorous process to secure an EDF loan could be seen as a stamp of approval from the government, opening up additional funding to help nascent companies and technologies get off the ground. Over its more than 20 years there have been hits — including a 2010 loan to Tesla — and misses, most notably backing solar manufacturer Solyndra, which ultimately went bankrupt.Under President Joe Biden and his climate-focused administration, the agency was supercharged, acting as a green bank of sorts. Staff quadrupled, and the Inflation Reduction Act grew available funds by tenfold.But with the new administration, the office has changed course, shedding the green angle that President Donald Trump has called a scam. In addition to an official name change, the agency is now focused on six areas: nuclear; coal, oil, gas and hydrocarbons; critical materials and minerals; geothermal; grid and transmission; and manufacturing and transportation.\"Every project that we do will make energy more affordable for Americans, will help us win AI and will bolster the grid and get us out from under the China strategy to dominate certain critical minerals,\" Beard said. \"Everything we do will have a very specific focus.\"EDF now 'open for business'During the first Trump administration, the EDF was largely dormant. But now, Beard said, the office is ready to get going. \"We have direction. We are open for business. … We will, I think, invest this capital in America's future in record time,\" he said.The office has about 80 active loan applications in its pipeline, according to Beard. It's a mix of new projects as well as those that have been reframed to meet the administration's priorities, he said.The reorganized EDF has dispensed three loans to AEP, Constellation Energy and Wabash Valley Resources. All three originated during the prior administration. But Beard said the pace will soon pick up, hinting that an upcoming announcement could be the agency's largest-ever loan.\"The initial quarters were really a turnaround job for fixing what this office had done in the past,\" he said. \"Now we're focused on the future.\"The first soup-to-nuts loan from the EDF will likely act as a starting point for a \"wave of loans around affordability, reliability and increased generation on the grid,\" Beard said, adding that a \"big portion of capital\" will end up focusing on power costs.Affordability is becoming a bigger issue as the midterms approach. Electricity prices are rising faster than overall inflation, becoming a pain point for consumers who are feeling pinched on all sides. For years, power demand grew at a steady clip, giving utilities, which plan sometimes decades in advance, visibility into future needs. But that's changing. Power demand is rising for a few reasons, including the voracious power needs of artificial intelligence, reshoring of manufacturing and broader electrification. Reliability is also a key issue. A lack of accessible power is seen as one potential bottleneck in the AI arms race with China. Increasingly frequent and severe storms, attributed to climate change, are another source of stress on the power grid.The Trump administration has announced a host of initiatives it says will help meet the demand, including earlier in February ordering the Defense Department to purchase coal power and keep coal-fired plants running. U.S. coal use has been declining for years thanks to competition from cheaper gas and renewables. Beard hopes his EDF can address the supply crunch. One avenue is to focus on maximizing existing generation, he said. \"We need to refurbish and refresh existing generation, not shut if off. And not make the hill that's already a mountain that much tougher to climb,\" he said.Newbuilds are also part of the picture, he said. \"We need to remember again how important it is to do it and to build. So that's really what we're pushing,\" he said.Permitting delays can challenge new projects. Many regions in the country have a yearslong backlog of projects that want to connect to the grid. Amid the supply crunch, some have criticized the administration's decision to cancel several offshore wind projects that were more than 90% complete. (Judges have since ordered construction to resume.) Critics think the administration should be more open to wind and solar, which can be produced at lower costs and in some cases connect to the grid faster. One way to compare costs across energy sources is by looking at the levelized cost of energy, or LCOE. According to widely cited data from Lazard, new utility-scale solar ranges in cost from $38-$78 per megawatt-hour. Onshore wind is $37-$86/MWh, gas combined cycle is $48-$109/MWh and coal is $71-$173/MWh. However, the LCOE fails to take into consideration the value of dispatchable resources as well as capacity factor, or the amount of time an asset is producing at its maximum output. Nuclear has the highest capacity factor at over 90%, according to the Energy Information Administration. Combined-cycle gas is at roughly 69%, with coal at 43%. Wind and solar are at 34% and 23%, respectively. Everything 'on the table' for new nuclearThe EDF has traditionally been an important backer of capital-intensive nuclear projects, which have at times come in over budget and behind schedule. And now, with the Trump administration throwing its weight behind nuclear and calling to quadruple U.S. capacity by 2050, nuclear is a priority for the agency. \"We can't lean in any harder,\" Beard said, adding that more activity in the space is expected in coming months and quarters. The agency is willing to lend up to 80% of the project cost, he said.Electrical transmission towers, poles and lines are shown in the early morning of a hot summer day in Commerce, California, Aug. 7, 2025.Mike Blake | ReutersTech companies also have turned to nuclear to power their data centers given it's the only source of emissions-free baseload power. Hyperscalers have signed power purchase agreements with the likes of Constellation and Vistra at above-market prices, indicating how desirable nuclear power is — reactors are online 24/7, unlike wind and solar power. Big tech has also backed small modular reactor companies, or SMRs, which promise faster timelines and controlled costs.The EDF in November finalized a $1 billion loan to Constellation Energy to restart its shuttered reactor at Three Mile Island, now known as the Crane Clean Energy Center. The agency previously provided $12 billion to Southern Company to build reactors 3 and 4 at Plant Vogtle, as well as a $1.5 billion loan guarantee to Holtec to restart the Palisades nuclear plant in Covert Township, Michigan. At present there are no commercial-scale reactors under construction in the U.S., although Westinghouse — maker of the AP1000 reactor — said it plans to build 10 large reactors, with construction beginning in 2030.Beard pointed to Trump's extension of the investment tax credit as advantageous for the industry. He said the EDF plans to support these long lead time projects.\"We spent the last year costing out and creating the incentive structures to let this industry flourish again,\" he said. \"Our view is everything that is required to restart this industry is on the table.\" Breaking China's minerals dominance Another key focus for the EDF will be critical minerals, as part of a broader push for the U.S. to shore up domestic supplies and move away from foreign dependence. China has weaponized metals in the past by restricting exports of rare earths, and given it dominates metal supply chains — especially when it comes to refining — there's fear they could curb other exports.Beard said that the Department of Defense is working on solving \"crisis-level issues,\" but that EDF plans to back companies seeking to break China's chokehold on metals key for everything from consumer products to the power grid and AI. \"If China is in year 10 of a 20-year plan, we will intervene and support those projects and companies that interrupt that strategy,\" he said. Although the agency's reorganization meant a reduction in staff, Beard said it won't slow the pace of loans or hurt the quality of projects it backs. Instead, he said, fewer people will be needed because the EDF will focus on projects that can be replicated, rather than one-of-a-kind projects that don't make economic sense.\"I'm only really a professional investor and a new government guy,\" he said. \"The discipline is make sure we are doing projects that benefit Americans and will be repaid.\"",

    "body": "Novo Nordisk stock fell 15% Monday after it said its next-generation weight loss drug didn't meet its key goal of showing that it wasn't inferior to Eli Lilly's rival drug.The drug, CagriSema, didn't achieve its primary endpoint of demonstrating non-inferiority on weight loss when compared to Eli Lilly's rival drug tirzepatide after 84 weeks, Novo said in a statement Monday morning. Tirzepatide is the active ingredient in Lilly's mega-blockbuster medicines Mounjaro and Zepbound, which have overtaken Novo Nordisk's semaglutide, sold as Ozempic and Wegovy, in U.S. prescriptions. Novo's Copenhagen-listed shares were last seen down 15% at 256 Danish kroner, hitting their lowest level since June 2021. Eli Lilly's stock rose 3.5% in premarket trading. Stock Chart IconStock chart iconNovo Nordisk ADR's are severely underperforming Eli Lilly shares.Patients taking a 2.4 mg dose of CagriSema achieved a weight loss of 23% after 84 weeks compared to 25.5% with a 15 mg dose of tirzepatide, Novo said.Novo is exploring additional trials to test CagriSema, including higher-dose combinations, it said. The company has high hopes for the drug, which combines semaglutide and cagrilintide, another hormone released in the pancreas that affects appetite. \"CagriSema has the potential to be the first GLP-1/amylin-combination product to reach the market for people living with obesity, documenting that cagrilintide adds to the existing benefits of semaglutide and offers clinically meaningful additive weight loss effects superior to what has been observed with GLP-1 biology alone,\" said Chief Scientific Officer Martin Holst Lange, adding that further trials would \"assess the full weight-loss potential of CagriSema.\"Even so, Monday's trial result is another blow to the Danish drugmaker as it fell short against a drug already on the market, and comes after the stock fell nearly 50% in 2025. Earlier this month, Novo predicted that its sales and profit growth would decline by between 5% and 13% in 2026, as the company navigates competition, lower prices in the U.S., and the loss of exclusivity for  Wegovy and Ozempic in certain markets. \"People should expect that it goes down before it comes back up,\" CEO Mike Doustdar told CNBC at the time.",

    "body": "The original six American Girl historical characters — Kirsten Larson, Samantha Parkington, Molly McIntire, Felicity Merriman, Addy Walker and Josefina Montoya — are displayed at the brand’s flagship store,Luke FountainThe flagship American Girl Place at Rockefeller Center in New York City feels frozen in time.The air smells faintly of vanilla. Young girls dart between doll displays clutching miniature shirts and sequined shoes. Beneath glittering chandeliers, the brand's iconic red boxes line shelves with museum-like precision. Blow dryers hum in the Doll Salon, and downstairs, pink-frosted cupcakes land on cafe tables before dolls sitting upright in their miniature highchairs.\"It feels timeless,\" said Jamie Cygielman, global head of dolls for Mattel, the brand's parent company. And yet, behind the scenes, the business of American Girl dolls is not what it once was. As American Girl turns 40, the brand is navigating more modern challenges: digital competition, shifting play patterns and an aging, more cost-conscious customer base. \"The anniversary is at precarious moment for American Girl and the whole doll industry,\" said Jaime Katz, an analyst who covers Mattel for Morningstar. \"Kids are more digital in play, and the [American Girl] brand has struggled.\"Around a decade ago, at its peak, American Girl was recording more than $600 million in annual sales. By 2023, annual sales had fallen to roughly $200 million — just a third of prior levels.While American Girl has shrunk back considerably from the mid-2010s, the brand has more recently posted five consecutive quarters of sales growth — one of the few steady performers inside Mattel's portfolio. \"Growing off a base that's down more than 60% doesn't mean the brand is back. It means it's stabilizing,\" Katz told CNBC.Earlier this month, Mattel reported fourth-quarter sales of $1.77 billion, falling short of Wall Street expectations after holiday demand came in lighter than projected and heavier discounting weighed on margins. Earnings per share likewise fell short, and Mattel issued a lower-than-expect profit forecast for 2026.Mattel shares have fallen roughly 19% since the Feb. 10 report and are down about 20% over the past year. Citi and JPMorgan downgraded the stock after the results, too. \"People are watching Mattel this year ... waiting with baited breath, because they are spending a ton and it seems unlikely they will be bringing in big profits,\" Katz said.A doll gets her hair washed, brushed and curled at the American Girl Salon at the brand's flagship store in Rockefeller Center.Luke FountainLongstanding issuesEven before the Covid pandemic forced American Girl to reduce its retail footprint from about 15 stores in 2019 to seven U.S. locations today, the brand faced mounting competition from lower-priced alternatives at big-box retailers like Target's \"Our Generation\" line. A traditional, 18-inch American Girl typically starts at $135, excluding accessories, which can cost as much as $250 for a bunk bed or $275 for a beach cruiser. The premium price once signaled to many parents a mark of quality and prestige, said Laura Tretter, co-host of the American Girl Women podcast. But in an inflation-conscious environment, it's narrowed the customer base, Katz said.\"Parents are more selective about discretionary spending right now,\" Katz said. \"That price point [for an American Girl doll] looks steep to many households.\"Across the toy industry, companies, including competitors like Hasbro, are grappling with how to get kids interested in their products, particularly amid uneven consumer spending and, recently, trade uncertainty. \"There are so many more things today that a kid might be enticed by to play with,\" Cygielman told CNBC. \"There's also more competition today, and we saw in the past that tariffs can make an impact on the toy market, but we adapt.\"For many kids, play has migrated toward tablets, gaming subscriptions and short-form video. \"The definition of 'toy' has changed,\" Katz said. \"A iPad or Nintendo Switch competes directly with a doll. There are simply more claims on the same discretionary dollar.\"Overall, Mattel's doll and preschool categories have faced steady declines for the last three quarters, even after the halo effect of 2023's \"Barbie\" movie. Global dolls sales fell 7% in the latest quarter, while the infant, toddler and preschool segment declined 17%.Struggling sales for American Girl and Mattel's Fisher Price brand motivated activist investor Barington Capital in 2024 to push the company to streamline its portfolio and improve returns, floating the possibility of selling off the brands. \"American Girl is not a huge part of Mattel's overall financial profile,\" Katz said. \"Still though, for investors, the question isn't whether the brand is beloved. It's whether it's strategically essential. It was a drag on profits.\"A girl waits with her new Truly Me doll at the American Girl flagship store in Rockefeller Center.Luke FountainCapitalizing on loyaltyInside the Rockefeller Center store, those industry headwinds feel distant.On a recent visit, Lisa Kandoski stood gazing at Molly McIntire — the World War II-era heroine adorned with round wire-rimmed glasses, a navy argyle sweater and braids tied in red ribbons — just like the doll Kandoski said her grandmother put under the Christmas tree in 1990.\"It's not just a doll,\" Kandoski, now 40, told CNBC, her eyes misty. \"I sort of realized the impact Molly had on me as a kid. She taught me that you could be brave even when the world was scary, that you could 'do your part' even when you were small. She shaped who I am.\"That emotional alchemy has defined American Girl since it disrupted the doll industry in 1986. At the time, the market was dominated by either fashion dolls mirroring adulthood or baby dolls to rehearse motherhood. The original six American Girl characters — Samantha, Kirsten, Molly, Felicity, Addy and Josefina — came with books tackling subjects rarely taught to young kids like child labor or racism, and all dolls treated girlhood itself as a formative stage.\"American Girl remains a moral compass for many of us,\" said Tretter of the American Girl Women podcast. \"I love that girls today are still getting positive messages about inclusivity, friendship and going through difficult changes.\"Over time, American Girl expanded into publishing, film and destination retail while diversifying its characters, like with the 2026 \"Girl of the Year,\" Raquel Reyes, a biracial DJ and animal rescuer who helps run her family's Kansas City paleta shop.The brand's whimsical seriousness became a differentiator and fostered generational loyalty, said Justine Orlovsky-Schnitzler, a folklorist and author of \"An American Girl Anthology: Finding Ourselves in the Pleasant Company Universe.\"Look no further than the Doll Hospital where white-coated \"doctors\" triage patients, fit wheelchairs, perform eye exams, and apply miniature casts for doll owners of all ages.\"That's why people return,\" Orlovsky-Schnitzler said. \"You're not just buying plastic and fabric. You're revisiting a version of yourself.\"And even though the dolls remain preserved in childhood innocence, their original owners, now grown up, keep returning to American Girl through podcasts, memes, cosplay and fan fiction. Some pass their dolls down to their children. Others buy new ones for themselves.\"There's something powerful about handing your daughter the doll you once slept beside,\" Orlovsky-Schnitzler said. \"It's also just as comforting to go back to the days of your youth with your own doll.\" American Girl is releasing modernized version of its original six characters for the brand's 40th anniversary.MattelA growing baseMattel is battling to convert that nostalgia into broader sales growth. So‑called \"kidult\" consumers — adults who buy toys for themselves — have become a coveted demographic. By late 2024, spending on toys for adults 18 and older had surpassed that for children ages 3 to 5, according to market research firm Circana. That cohort continued to drive industry growth in 2025.Mattel has increasingly sought to monetize its intellectual property through publishing, collectibles, entertainment and digital platforms. In interviews and on calls with investors, Mattel CEO Ynon Kreiz has said that mobile games and interactive platforms are particularly promising areas. However, \"nostalgia must translate into durable revenue and sales growth,\" Katz said. Lean too heavily into adult collectors, and a brand risks \"aging alongside its original audience.\" Pivot too aggressively toward digital trends, and it \"risks diluting what made it distinctive.\"Competitors have been doing the same. For instance, Lego continues to release more brick building sets aimed at adults like flowers, art and collectables based on millennial pop culture favorites such as the 1990s TV hit \"Friends.\" For American Girl, its 40th anniversary offers a natural inflection point to strike a balance between kid and adult fans, Cygielman said.American Girl is releasing modernized versions of its original six characters and publishing its first book for adults, centered on Samantha Parkington and set during her adulthood in the 1920s. At the same time, the brand is working to keep the next generation engaged through contemporary \"Girl of the Year\" storylines and investments in digital platforms, including YouTube, TikTok and \"American Girl World\" on Roblox.\"Nostalgia is an entry point, not the endgame,\" Cygielman said. \"The question is how we extend that emotional equity into new platforms and new audiences.\"",

    "body": "European startup IQM is aiming to build powerful quantum computers to rival the likes of Google and IBM.IQMFinland-based quantum computing startup IQM announced plans Monday to become one of Europe's first publicly listed companies in the sector.IQM will merge with special purpose acquisition company (SPAC), Real Asset Acquisition Corp as part of the listing in New York. The deal, which gives IQM an initial equity valuation of $1.8 billion, is pending shareholders' approval and other regulatory conditions being met, the firm said in a Monday statement.The company is eyeing the transaction being completed around June this year, with the listing to happen shortly after that. It's also considering a dual listing on the Helsinki stock exchange.Founded in 2018, IQM raised $320 million in a Series B funding round in September, which valued the company at $1 billion. The round was led by Ten Eleven Ventures, a U.S. cybersecurity-focused investment firm, while Finnish venture capital firm Tesi also invested.IQM is building full-stack, open-architecture quantum systems that can be deployed on-premise or accessed via the cloud.The merger could provide over $300 million in funding for the company, in the form of private investment in public equity financing and cash held in RAAQ's trust account, assuming no redemptions (when investors in the SPAC withdraw their money from the transaction ahead of the listing). Commercial deploymentQuantum computing promises to run calculations vastly quicker than classical computers can, solving more complex problems and processing larger volumes of data. Proponents of the technology say it could be used to facilitate breakthroughs in areas like medicine, science and finance. While the tech is not yet deployed in commercial environments and still has significant technical obstacles to overcome to become viable, some analysts are particularly bullish on the quantum sector.\"Whilst progress has been slow and there have been many challenges, we are starting to see meaningful breakthroughs in the quantum space,\" UBS analysts wrote in a report in January.\"Quantum computing is a science project no more,\" Jan Goetz, cofounder and CEO at IQM, said. \"It is an industry where customers own, operate and build on advanced quantum computers.\"IQM has sold 21 quantum systems to 13 customers to date, the company said. It made at least $35 million in unaudited revenue in 2025. As some businesses eye commercial deployment of quantum computers by the end of the decade, discussions have begun about how they will integrate with the data center sector.IQM is one of a number of European players in the quantum computing space. U.K.-based Quantinuum raised $800 million across two rounds last year, with Spain's Multiverse Computing picking up 189 million euros in a Series B last year.China is leading in terms of public investment in the sector. The country has funnelled just short of $18 billion in public investment in quantum technology, followed closely by the EU, according to the European Centre for International Political Economy (ECIPE), a think tank.",

Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping will seek a truce in their bruising trade war on October 30, with the US president predicting a \"great meeting\" but Beijing being more circumspect. (Photo by ANDREW CABALLERO-REYNOLDS / AFP) (Photo by ANDREW CABALLERO-REYNOLDS/AFP via Getty Images)          Andrew Caballero-reynolds | Afp | Getty ImagesThe U.S. Supreme Court's decision to strike down President Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs has strengthened China's hand ahead of a summit with his counterpart Xi Jinping, where Beijing is expected to push for reduced U.S. support for Taiwan, analysts said. In a ruling Friday, the court said Trump wrongfully invoked the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to implement broad tariffs. That decision has weakened Trump's negotiating leverage as he prepared for a trip to Beijing in April, said Wendy Cutler, senior vice president at the Asia Society Policy Institute.\"He has effectively had his wings clipped on his signature economic policy,\" said Cutler, who was also a former U.S. trade representative.  Trump will visit China from March 31 to April 2, the first trip by an American president since his last visit in 2017. Xi is also expected to make a state visit to Washington later this year. Analysts said the ruling could change the dynamics around efforts to extend a trade truce negotiated last year and complicate Trump's push for Beijing to buy large quantities of U.S. soybeans, Boeing aircraft and energy exports.\"It limits Trump's ability to deploy tariffs at will, reduces pressure on Beijing to expand soybean purchases or ease rare earth access, and gives China leverage to push for the removal of the remaining 10% tariffs linked to fentanyl,\" said Dan Wang, China director of Eurasia Group. For Beijing's part, it could use the opportunity to press Washington to ease technology export controls, remove certain Chinese entities from U.S. sanctions lists, and cut back arms sales to Taiwan, said Xinbo Wu, director at Fudan University's Center for American Studies.\"[The ruling] certainly helps strengthen China's position in its negotiation with the U.S,\" Wu said.Non-tariff tools While Trump's tariff authority may be somewhat diminished, he could deploy non-tariff measures, such as technology controls and sanctions against Chinese entities, as negotiating tools, experts said. \"The measures with real structural impact remain non-tariff tools,\" said Wang. These include expanded export controls on advanced chips and broader restrictions against Chinese tech firms, Wang said.The U.S. stance on the Taiwan issue, disputes over the South China Sea and security ties with Japan and Korea still rest largely with Trump, he added.  In a statement Monday, China's commerce ministry said it is currently assessing the impacts from the implementation of the ruling, while urging the U.S. to remove all unilateral tariffs against its trading partners. \"China and the U.S. both stand to gain from cooperation and lose from confrontation,\" according to the ministry's statement translated by CNBC. watch nowFollowing the Supreme Court's ruling, Trump responded with a 10% global tariff under Section 122 of the Trade Act of 1974 — before raising it further to 15%, which the president said would be \"effective immediately.\" In a Truth Social post on Saturday, Trump dangled a warning that more tariffs would follow: \"During the next short number of months, the Trump Administration will determine and issue the new and legally permissible Tariffs.\" It remains unclear if any official documents have been signed detailing the timing. A White House fact sheet issued Friday said the original 10% tariffs would go into effect on Tuesday, Feb. 24, at 12:01 a.m. ET. Before the ruling, Washington had imposed an additional 20% tariff on Chinese exports last year —including a 10% reciprocal tariff and a 10% fentanyl-related tariff — citing IEEPA authority. The Supreme Court's ruling implies a net reduction of around 5% in U.S. tariffs on China, according to Goldman Sachs. \"Overall, this development suggests upside risk to our positive outlook on Chinese exports this year,\" Goldman said. A study by the trade monitoring body Global Trade Alert also named China among the top winners under the revised Section 122 tariff regime, with a 7.1 percentage point reduction in tariff rates. John Gong, a former consultant to China's commerce ministry, said that Beijing is not \"betting their strategy on the dispute between the executive and judicial branches of the [U.S.] government, although a lower tariff rate 'is something nice to have.'\" 301 Section investigationStill, China faces an ongoing Section 301 investigation launched last year over its compliance with the Phase One trade deal from Trump's first term. watch nowThe Office of the U.S. Trade Representative said in October last year that China appeared not to have met its commitments to expand market access, lower non-tariff barriers, and ramp up purchases of U.S. goods and services, despite repeated U.S. engagement to address implementation concerns.  \"Once the U.S. has decided that a country is an 'unfair' trade partner, Section 301 comes with substantial flexibilities to use tariffs or other measures,\" said Deborah Elms, head of trade policy at the Hinrich Foundation. China said Monday that it is \"watching closely\" the U.S. move in using trade investigations to maintain higher tariffs, vowing to \"firmly safeguard\" Chinese interests.The ruling may have a limited impact on broader U.S.-China relations, said Scott Kennedy from the Center for Strategic and International Studies, who noted that tensions extend beyond tariffs. \"The [Supreme Court] ruling doesn't upend U.S.-China relations the way it might to U.S. ties with its allies and others, because China had already gained the upper hand,\" he said. watch nowKennedy expects the April summit to yield limited results, such as an extension of the ceasefire and sales of U.S. products, but progress is unlikely on thornier issues such as clear guidelines for export controls or rebalancing China's economy.During a phone call earlier this month, Xi asserted to Trump that Taiwan is the \"most important issue\" in U.S.-China relations — overshadowing the commercial deals Trump touted at the time, including Chinese purchases of American energy and agricultural products.Upcoming talks between the two leaders may prove more political than economic, said Minxin Pei, a professor of political science at Claremont McKenna College. Xi might be \"open to giving Trump a better commercial deal\" in exchange for a statement on Taiwan that Beijing could claim as a victory, Pei said. — CNBC's Elaine Yu contributed to this story. ",

    "body": "U.S. President Donald Trump meets with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen (not pictured), in Turnberry, Scotland, Britain, July 27, 2025. Evelyn Hockstein | ReutersEurope has warned that trade deals struck with the U.S. could now be at risk after President Donald Trump unveiled a new global 15% tariff on all imports at the weekend.Trump's move came after the U.S. Supreme Court on Friday struck down his global tariffs policy, implemented last spring, that had upset the long-standing global trading order.The president reacted to the Supreme Court's judgment by initially announcing a new universal 10% levy, using a different legal framework for the latest tariffs, but then increased the global tariff rate to 15% — the legal maximum which can be in place for 150 days before Congressional approval is required. The new import duties are \"effective immediately,\" Trump said in a Truth Social post on Saturday. Officials in Europe and London expressed alarm and consternation at the latest upheaval in global trade relations, saying Trump's new tariff policy could upend trade deals signed with the U.S. last year. They asked for more clarity from the White House as to what the new tariff policy framework means in practice for their respective trade deals, which saw most EU exports to the States hit with a 15% duty, and those from the U.K. slapped with a 10% levy.watch now\"Pure tariff chaos from the U.S. administration,\" the Chair of the European Parliament's committee on International Trade, Bernd Lange, reacted to the White House on Sunday.\"No one can make sense of it anymore — only open questions and growing uncertainty for the EU and other U.S. trading partners,\" Lange wrote on social media platform X. \"Do new tariffs ... not constitute a breach of the deal? Regardless, no one knows whether the US will adhere to it – or even be able to,\" Lange said, adding that \"clarity and legal certainty are needed before any further steps are taken.\" The European Parliament's trade committee is due to hold an emergency meeting on Monday to discuss Trump's latest trade move, and Lange said he'll propose suspending the implementation of the U.S.-EU trade deal until the bloc has \"a comprehensive legal assessment and clear commitments from the U.S\" regarding the latest tariffs. The European Commission issued a statement Sunday noting that \"a deal is a deal\" and that it expected the U.S. \"to honour its commitments ... just as the EU stands by its commitments.\" CNBC has asked the Commission for further comment.(COMBO) This combination of pictures created in Berlin on January 6, 2026 shows (clockwise, from top L) Germany's Chancellor Friedrich Merz (in Brussels on December 18, 2025), Italy's Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni (in Johannesburg on November 23, 2025), Spain's Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez (in Brussels on December 18, 2025), Poland's Prime Minister Donald Tusk (in Brussels on December 18, 2025), France's President Emmanuel Macron (at the Elysee Palace in Paris, on January 6, 2026) and Britain's Prime Minister Keir Starmer (in London on December 10, 2025). A group of European leaders on January 6, 2026 underlined their support for Denmark after US President Donald Trump again voiced designs on its autonomous Arctic territory of Greenland. Nicolas Tucat,gianluigi Guercia,john Thys,ben Stansall,ludovic Marin | Afp | Getty ImagesGerman Chancellor Friedrich Merz told German broadcaster ARD that there would be \"a very clear European position on this\" ahead of his visit to the White House in early March, but he deferred to the European Commission in Brussels as to how the EU would respond to the tariffs. However, French Trade Minister Nicolas Forissier suggested that Brussels could hit back at Washington. Speaking to the Financial Times, Forissier urged EU members to \"be naive\" and to adopt a united approach against the White House's new trade position.The U.K. has also questioned how the new tariff policy will affect its trade deal with the States, which, given its baseline 10% tariff rate, had put the country at a competitive advantage to its European neighbors.\"Under any scenario, we expect our privileged trading position with the U.S. to continue and will work with the administration to understand how the ruling will affect tariffs for the U.K. and the rest of the world,\" a U.K. government spokesperson said at the weekend.Trade deals on, or off?Europe's bitter reaction to the new tariff policy means U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer has his work cut out to reassure partners that trade deals agreed last summer still stand. Greer defended Trump's tariff stance on Sunday, saying the president's trade policy has not changed fundamentally, and that trade deals still stand.\"The president's policy was going to continue. That's why they signed these deals, even while the litigation was pending. So we're having active conversations with them. We want them to understand that these deals are going to be good deals. We expect to stand by them. We expect our partners to stand by them,\" he told CBS' Face the Nation. \"And I haven't heard anyone yet come to me and say, 'the deal's off.' They want to see how this plays out. I'm in active conversation with them on it,\" he added.watch nowOn the face of it, current U.S. trade tariffs on the EU are not changing, with the new 15% rate the same as the rate under its trade deal. Exclusions still apply too, with pharmaceuticals, critical minerals, fertilizers and certain agricultural products exempt, while other tariffs on auto and steel exports remain the same.  Those with the lowest tariffs to begin with are ostensibly hurt more, however, with the U.K. at a notable disadvantage if its trade deal tariff rate is not honored.On a trade-weighted basis, the U.K. faces a 2.1 percentage point increase in its average tariff rate, while the EU sees a 0.8 point rise, according to analysis from Swiss-based trade watchdog Global Trade Alert. In contrast, Brazil's rate plunges 13.6 points, and China's drops 7.1 points.Tina Fordham, founder of Fordham Global Foresight, told CNBC Monday that the U.S.' closest allies seem to be worst hit by what she described as the latest \"trade chaos\" but agreed more clarity was needed from U.S. officials.\"This is an administration that doesn't think too much about second or third-order effects, and so what we're seeing is that those countries that tried to get in early and do an advantageous deal when the president was first starting to talk about these levies ... are being penalized,\" she told CNBC's \"Europe Early Edition.\"European markets opened lower on Monday, showing investor jitters over the latest tariff move. European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde warned Sunday that the trans-Atlantic business relationship could suffer as a result of trade uncertainty.\"It's critically important that all people in the trade, both outside of the United States, but also in the United States, have clarity about the future of the relationships,\" she told CBS' Face the Nation on Sunday. \"It's a bit like driving. You want to know the rules of the road before you get in the car. It's the same with trade,\" she added.\"If it [the new tariffs policy] shakes the whole equilibrium which people in the trade had got used to ... [it] is going to bring about disruptions in the business for sure,\" she said.",

    "body": "Sam Altman, chief executive officer of OpenAI Inc., at the AI Impact Summit in New Delhi, India, on Thursday, Feb. 19, 2026. Prakash Singh | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesOpenAI CEO Sam Altman on Friday defended the resource demands of artificial intelligence, calling concerns about data centers' water use \"fake\" and comparing the energy used by AI systems to that of humans.Altman was speaking on the sidelines of the India AI Impact summit in an interview with The Indian Express when he was asked to address common criticisms of AI, such as its energy and water consumption. The CEO responded that claims circulating online that ChatGPT uses gallons of water per query were  \"completely untrue, totally insane,\" and have \"no connection to reality.\" Data centers traditionally use large amounts of water to cool electrical components and prevent overheating. While data center cooling technologies have promised reduced consumption, some newer data centers no longer rely on water at all.Still, even with improving efficiency, a report last month from water technology company Xylem and Global Water Intelligence projected that the water drawn for cooling would more than triple over the next 25 years as computing demand rises, putting pressure on water systems.While dismissing fears about water use, Altman said energy consumption remains a fair AI concern. \"Not per query, but in total – because the world is using so much AI ... and we need to move towards nuclear or wind and solar very quickly,\" he said. Asked about previous comments from Microsoft founder Bill Gates — who has suggested that the efficiency of the human brain proves that AI can evolve to also become more energy efficient over time —Altman pushed back.\"One of the things that is always unfair in this comparison is people talk about how much energy it takes to train an AI model ... But it also takes a lot of energy to train a human,\" he said. \"It takes like 20 years of life, and all the food you eat before that time, before you get smart.\" \"The fair comparison is if you ask ChatGPT a question, how much energy does it take once a model is trained to answer that question, versus a human, and probably AI has already caught up on an energy efficiency basis, measured that way,\" he added. The process Altman is referencing is known as inference, which refers to the use of AI models that have already been trained to create new outputs. AI inference is typically much less power-intensive than the training itself. Altman's comments, particularly the AI-to-human comparison, have since sparked some debate online amid growing anxiety about AI's ability to replace human work.Sridhar Vembu, co-founder and chief scientist of Indian software company Zoho Corporation, who was present at the summit, criticized the human-AI equivalence. \"I do not want to see a world where we equate a piece of technology to a human being,\" the billionaire said in an X post. The debate comes as governments and companies pour billions into new data centers to support the computing needs of AI systems.According to a May report by the International Monetary Fund, electricity consumption by the world's data centers in 2023 had already reached levels comparable to Germany or France, soon after the launch of OpenAI's groundbreaking ChatGPT AI model.In response, some governments have been working to speed up approval processes to bring new and cheap energy online, with some environmentalists warning such moves could clash with global net-zero goals.Some local communities in countries like the U.S. have also pushed back on development projects over fears they will strain electricity grids and raise overall electricity costs. Last week, the City Council in San Marcos, Texas, voted down a proposed $1.5 billion data center project after months of public opposition. Amid such pushback, many tech leaders, including OpenAI's Altman, have argued data centers will require more energy production from diverse sources, including renewable and nuclear energy.",

    "body": "Thomas Fuller | SOPA Images | Lightrocket | Getty ImagesInvestors have been grappling with volatility amid fears of artificial intelligence disruption in a range of sectors, but attractive opportunities abound if they can look beneath the surface.Ignoring the ongoing noise, investors with a long-term horizon can track the recommendations of top Wall Street analysts, who take several aspects into account and conduct in-depth research before assigning a buy rating to a stock.  Here are three stocks favored by some of Wall Street's top pros, according to TipRanks, a platform that ranks analysts based on their past performance.DatadogArtificial intelligence-powered observability and security platform Datadog (DDOG) is this week's first pick. Following the company's Investor Day event on Feb. 12, Baird analyst William Power reiterated a buy rating on Datadog stock with a price target of $180. The analyst stated that while Datadog didn't provide any new long-term forecasts at the event, it continues to target an adjusted operating margin of over 25%, reflecting a balanced approach between investing for future growth and near-term profitability. Power noted solid demand for Datadog's existing products and growing opportunities in AI, logs, developer tools and security. He added that given Datadog's notable advantage in contextual data compared to rivals, the company is well-positioned to help enterprises as AI is increasing complexity within IT stacks. The five-star analyst believes that Datadog has the ability to address enterprises' security needs, supported by its broad observability platform and significant data insights. Power highlighted that while the company currently has about 8,500 security customers, including 70% of customers with over $1 million in annual recurring revenue (ARR), security makes up only 2% of total ARR from these large customers, reflecting that vast expansion opportunity.\"We remain positive on the company's leadership position in the observability market, the continued success of its land and expand motion, and long-term opportunities across new products (especially security),\" said Power. Power ranks No. 459 among more than 12,100 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been profitable 55% of the time, delivering an average return of 15.8%. See Datadog Ownership Structure on TipRanks. Vertiv HoldingsAI infrastructure company Vertiv Holdings (VRT) provides power and cooling solutions to data centers. VRT recently rallied after reporting upbeat results for the fourth quarter of 2025, with organic orders surging 252%. Citing solid order growth and insights from Vertiv's 10-K filing, Bank of America analyst Andrew Obin reiterated a buy rating on VRT stock and raised his price target to $277 from $250. Obin highlighted that the company expects the strong momentum in its orders to continue in 2026. \"To grow on top of 2025's $17.8bn in orders (+81% y/y organic) would be an impressive feat,\" said the analyst. He noted CEO Giordano Albertazzi's commentary that the pipeline was not depleted even after many large orders in the fourth quarter of 2025. Obin expects Vertiv's 2026 orders to grow by 5% to $18.6 billion. The analyst explained that even this modest year-over-year growth will result in significantly favorable backlog statistics. Specifically, a 5% order growth would add $5 billion to backlog (up 33% year over year). For Q1 2026, Obin projects $4.3 billion of orders (+52% year-over-year organic growth).Among the key takeaways from the 10-K filing, Obin highlighted that aside from tariff and economic uncertainty, AI, and thermal product expansion, Vertiv mentioned three new trends: strengthening services capabilities, strategic deals with Nvidia (NVDA) and Caterpillar (CAT), and prefabricated product development.Obin ranks No. 87 among more than 12,100 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been profitable 70% of the time, delivering an average return of 19.2%. See Vertiv Holdings Statistics on TipRanks. Arista NetworksFinally, we look at Arista Networks (ANET), which provides networking solutions to large AI and data center environments. The company impressed investors with market-beating Q4 results and issued strong guidance. Following the decline in ANET stock in reaction to the announcement that Nvidia will supply Meta Platforms (META) GPUs, CPUs, and networking solutions, Needham analyst Ryan Koontz said that he expects the deal to have \"little to no impact\" on Arista's solid supplier position with Meta. Koontz reiterated a buy rating on ANET stock with a price target of $185. It is worth noting that the analyst had recently raised his price target for Arista stock to $185 from $165. Koontz highlighted that the Meta Platforms-Nvidia deal sparked concerns as Arista is a major networking supplier to the social media company. The analyst estimates that Meta accounted for 16% of Arista's 2025 revenue. Based on several industry checks following the deal's announcement, Koontz continues to view ANET as a \"dominant\" supplier to Meta Platforms for its AI back-end spine and scale-across applications. \"Our checks indicate that the bulk of NVDA networking sales to Meta have been and will continue to be NICs [network interface cards] that bridge NVDA xPUs to a first layer of Spectrum-X switches, which are backed by the ANET spine and scale-across networks,\" noted Koontz. The five-star analyst added that the announcement doesn't reflect anything notably new in networking, and is in fact a follow-up to a similar announcement in October 2025 from the Open Compute Project (OCP) conference, when Nvidia announced that Meta would deploy Spectrum-X. Koontz ranks No. 277 among more than 12,100 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been profitable 51% of the time, delivering an average return of 24.7%. See Arista Networks Financials on TipRanks. ",

    "body": "A drone view shows the Netflix logo on one of the company's buildings in the Hollywood neighborhood in Los Angeles, California, U.S., Jan. 20, 2026.Daniel Cole | ReutersPresident Donald Trump late Saturday called on Netflix to fire board member Susan Rice or \"pay the consequences,\" after she said Democrats would push for corporate accountability if they regain power in the November midterm elections.In a Truth Social post on Saturday, Trump described Rice, who served as President Joe Biden's domestic policy chief and held top foreign policy posts under President Barack Obama, as \"purely a political hack\" with \"no talent or skills.\"\"HER POWER IS GONE, AND WILL NEVER BE BACK,\" Trump wrote. Rice argued during a podcast last week that \"it is not going to end well\" for corporations, news organizations, and law firms that \"bent the knee\" to Trump, and that their deference is unpopular.\"There is likely to be a swing in the other direction, and they are going to be caught with more than their pants down,\" Rice told Preet Bharara, a former U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York. \"They're going to be held accountable by those who come in opposition to Trump and win at the ballot box.\" She added, \"If these corporations think that Democrats, when they come back in power, are going to play by the old rules, and say, 'Never mind, we will forgive you for all the people you fired and all the policies and principles you violated, all the laws you skirted,' I think they got another thing coming.\"Rice served on Netflix's board from 2018 to 2021, and rejoined in 2023 after leaving the Biden administration. A Netflix spokesperson declined to comment on Trump's remarks, and the White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Trump included a screenshot of an earlier post from far-right activist and Trump ally Laura Loomer, who said Rice's remarks were \"anti-American\" and urged the president to \"kill the Netflix-Warner Bros. merger now.\" Loomer also tagged Federal Communications Commission Chairman Brendan Carr in her post.The comments come after Trump told NBC News earlier this month that the Department of Justice will \"handle\" the deal and that he'll stay out of their review, after previously saying he'd be involved in the process. The DOJ is currently reviewing Netflix's proposed acquisition of Warner Bros. Discovery.Netflix has proposed acquiring WBD in a $72 billion deal that would not include the company's cable networks, including CNN. Paramount Skydance, in response, launched a hostile takeover bid for all of WBD, promising its shareholders $30 per share in an all-cash deal. The DOJ is investigating whether Netflix's proposed deal could hurt competition, and it's also asked how the company's previous acquisitions have affected competition for creative talent, The Wall Street Journal reported earlier this month.As part of its review, the agency is also examining whether the streaming giant uses anticompetitive tactics in negotiations with independent content creators for acquiring programming, Bloomberg reported, citing documents.  Steve Sunshine, Netflix's outside counsel and the head of the global antitrust group at Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom, told CNBC in a statement that the law firm hasn't been given any notice that the DOJ is conducting a monopolization investigation. Netflix's Chief Legal Officer, David Hyman, said in a statement that the company operates in an \"extremely competitive market.\" \"Any claim that it is a monopolist, or seeking to monopolize, is unfounded,\" Hyman said. \"We neither hold monopoly power nor engage in exclusionary conduct and we'll gladly cooperate, as we always do, with regulators on any concerns they may have.\"Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos said last month that he's confident the company will be able to secure regulatory approval \"because this deal is pro-consumer ... pro-innovation, pro-worker.\"",

    "body": "A Secret Service agent guards the Mar-a-Lago home of former President Donald Trump on March 21, 2023 in Palm Beach, Florida.Joe Raedle | Getty ImagesAuthorities fatally shot a man who was carrying a shotgun and a gas cannister as he tried to enter President Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago club in Florida early Sunday morning, the Secret Service said.Trump was at the White House at the time of the incident. The president maintains a residence at Mar-a-Lago, and frequently dines and hosts events at the Palm Beach club.The man was shot by Secret Service agents and a Palm Beach County Sheriff deputy at around 1:30 a.m. ET after entering the secure perimeter around Mar-a-Lago near its north gate and then raising the shotgun at an officer, authorities said.The man who was shot has been identified as 21-year-old Austin Tucker Martin of North Carolina, according to an FBI statement on Sunday. Palm Beach County Sheriff Rick Bradshaw told reporters at a press conference on Sunday that \"a deputy and two Secret Service agents on the detail went to that area to investigate.\"\"They confronted a white male [who] was carrying a gas can and a shotgun,\" Bradshaw said. \"He was ordered to drop those two pieces of equipment that he had with him, at which time he put down the gas can, raised the shotgun to a shooting position.\"\"At that point in time, the deputy and the two Secret Service agents fired their weapons and neutralized the threat,\" Bradshaw said.The FBI is investigating the incident.\"Secret Service acted quickly and decisively to neutralize a crazy person, armed with a gun and a gas canister, who intruded President Trump's home,\" White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a post on X.She also knocked Democrats over the partial government shutdown, which impacted the Department of Homeland Security, which houses the Secret Service. \"It's shameful and reckless that Democrats have chosen to shut down their Department,\" Leavitt said. DHS has been shuttered for more than a week. Democrats are demanding changes to how the department conducts immigration enforcement operations before agreeing to fund the agency, after two U.S. citizens were shot and killed by federal agents in Minneapolis. Trump narrowly avoided assassination in July 2024 when a gunman shot at him from a roof overlooking a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania. A Secret Service sniper killed the gunman, Thomas Matthew Crooks.Two months after that attempt, another would-be assassin, Ryan Routh, was arrested less than an hour after a Secret Service agent fired at Routh as he lay in wait with a rifle outside a golf course where Trump was playing.Routh was convicted of trying to kill Trump. He was recently sentenced to life in prison. ",

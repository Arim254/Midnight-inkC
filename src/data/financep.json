    "body": "Everyone who knows me knows that I can't stand owing money. I pay down my credit cards every month, and I complete Venmo requests the second I get them.The only debt I have left is my student loan, which has been on minimum payment autopilot since I graduated from college in 2013. For many years, I left those payments on the back burner, funneling any extra savings I had toward my investments.Recently, though, my financial strategy changed after my fiancé and I began planning for a wedding in summer 2027. I sold a fair amount of stock and dialed back my retirement contributions in order to build our wedding fund.For the first time in my life, I'm sitting on a pile of cash. And I have to say, I'm very tempted to use a chunk of it to wipe out my loan.Hear me out. My student debt carries an interest rate of 6.55% and is scheduled to be paid off in late 2027. If I paid my loan off now, I could take my monthly loan payment, plus a few extra dollars, tack it on to my regular contributions to the wedding fund, and still hit our funding goal on time. Plus, I'd be debt-free.I chatted with a few certified financial planners, and pretty much everyone agreed that the math works in my favor.\"If you have the funds available, paying off the loans first is a smart move,\" says MaryAnne Gucciardi, a CFP with Wealthmind Financial Planning. \"That's a guaranteed 6.55% 'return,' which is higher than what you're likely earning in even the best high-yield savings account.\"So as you're reading this, I've already paid the loan off, right? Well, no. I actually decided against it. Here's why.My decision to hold off on repaying my loan, for nowThe mathematical principle Gucciardi points out is an important one that applies to a broad array of situations in personal finance. Paying down a loan with a particular interest rate is equivalent to earning an annualized return on an investment.It's a quick and dirty way to decide how to prioritize your financial goals. If you have credit card debt at 20% — currently right around the average, according to Bankrate — paying it down is like earning 20% a year in the stock market. Because that's a figure your portfolio is unlikely to earn on a long-term basis, the thinking goes, you're better off prioritizing the debt.The same logic applies to my loan. The 3.4% annual percentage yield we're earning in our savings account falls short of the 6.55% I owe on my loans.The cost of making such a move, Gucciardi and others pointed out to me, is liquidity. Once I make the lump sum payment, I won't be able to go to my student loan servicer and ask for my money back. Catching up by the time of our wedding date is as easy as redirecting the freed-up cash from my student loan payment to put toward the wedding fund. But a lot could go wrong between now and then.What if I lose my job? Or one of us needs expensive medical treatment? Or elements of our wedding end up costing much more than we budgeted for? I have emergency savings, but a few things going wrong could make what looked really easy on paper into something really hard in real life.So I did some more math. I've paid off 81% of my student debt, meaning that the vast majority of my payment these days goes toward paying down the principal rather than the interest. By my calculations, paying the loan now, instead of continuing with minimum payments, would save me somewhere between $400 and $500 in interest.\"That net difference is the price of financial flexibility,\" says Sean Pearson, a CFP with Ameriprise Financial Services. \"It's the price of doing the things that you want to do that are the most important to you when you need to get them done.\"To be clear, my financial priorities might not be the same as yours, and it's worth discussing your own goals with a financial advisor. Right now, the wedding is the most important thing I'm saving money for. I want it be everything my fiancé and I envision, and I want our (frankly, too many) guests to have an amazing time. Having the extra cash on hand in case anything comes up is worth paying my student loan servicer an extra $400.It's a lesson I'm applying to my broader financial life too. While certain financial strategies are mathematically optimal, they may not fit within my particular set of goals.\"While imperfect, the best solution is often to make a budget that allows you to reach your priorities when they exist on your timeline and remember that the calendar is as important to your financial plan as your calculator,\" Pearson says.Want to level up your AI skills? Sign up for Smarter by CNBC Make It's new online course, How To Use AI To Communicate Better At Work.

    "body": "A recent string of high-profile layoffs have taken up headlines and caused anxiety in the workforce.Companies announced 153,074 layoffs in October, adding up to 1.1 million cut announcements for the year, according to outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas. That makes it the worst year for layoff notices since 2009, CNBC reported.But job experts say they're not in panic mode. Layoff news doesn't paint the whole picture of the job market. Private data around job openings, payrolls and employee sentiment show that hiring is cooling but \"not falling off a cliff,\" says Glassdoor chief economist Daniel Zhao.The Challenger monthly data can be volatile, for one, and layoff announcements haven't yet shown up in state-level weekly filings for unemployment benefits, which are still being released during the shutdown.\"I'm not alarmed,\" says Laura Ullrich, Indeed's director of economic research. The latest available data \"does not seem today to indicate that we're going into a high layoff period for the overall economy.\"Government shutdown and layoffs are hitting worker confidenceWhile economists aren't predicting a recession anytime soon, news of layoffs and the government shutdown is hitting worker confidence.The share of Glassdoor reviews mentioning layoffs is up 22% year-over-year as of October, according to data from the jobs site. Workers' confidence in the job market is down from a small rise in September and is close to a recent record-low set in June, according to Glassdoor data.Senior-level employees saw the biggest drops in confidence over the last year, dropping 4.6 percentage points since October 2024.That's concerning since leadership confidence spreads to other employees through hiring and investment plans. If senior leaders aren't confident their business is doing well, they could decide to reduce hiring or lay people off, Zhao says.Meanwhile, for those on the market, fewer people say they've gotten a job offer and declined it, signaling they have less leverage and might be settling for jobs rather than holding out for better ones, according to Glassdoor data.Health-care openings are making up for losses elsewhereMany workers are additionally competing for a smaller pool of opportunities. As of Oct. 31, job postings on Indeed are at their lowest level since 2021, continuing a declining trend for the last four years.Job postings are lowest in areas hit by the government shutdown, including Washington, D.C., and recent tech layoffs, like California and Washington.Openings are concentrated in health-care sectors, security and safety, and engineering, which on the whole are keeping the job market stable.\"I see it a tale of two economies,\" Ullrich says. \"There are certain fields where jobs are continuing to be added, and there's others that are shedding jobs.\"Health care and private education jobs have propped up the labor economy for some time: They make up about 17% of the jobs nationally but have accounted for 56% of job growth between July 2023 and July 2025.\"If health-care employment started dipping that would ring alarm bells for me,\" Ullrich says.The bigger picture: 'The job market is in a funk'Economists say available datasets can provide a pretty good picture of the job market, but official data from the Labor Department around hiring and unemployment are necessary for a best look at the health of the labor economy.The unemployment rate remained steady 4.3% in August, the last month of available government data.The Bureau of Labor Statistics missed another jobs report Friday due to the government shutdown. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones expect it would have shown a drop in 60,000 jobs and a rising unemployment rate to 4.5%, CNBC reported.The numbers we do have point overall to a continuously slowing job market. Economic uncertainty is weighing on employers' willingness to hire, Zhao says, meaning job-seekers are frozen out of the market and employed workers have less leverage to progress in their careers, win raises and stay engaged in the workplace.Hiring experts say building your network and asking for referrals are the best ways to get a job right now. To stand out in a competitive market, consider sharpening your resume to be outcomes-based, building your personal brand on LinkedIn and doing mock interviews, GrowthLoop senior recruiter Kathleen Nolan previously told CNBC Make It.\"Overall, I would say that the job market is in a funk right now,\" Zhao says. \"Even if unemployment is even [and] some of the top line indicators still point to a job market that is not historically bad, that doesn't necessarily mean that people are happy with where the job market is today.\"Want to level up your AI skills? Sign up for Smarter by CNBC Make It's new online course, How To Use AI To Communicate Better At Work.

    "body": "In 2020, Anita Kinoshita, 28 years old at the time, started looking into buying a house.Kinoshita was living in California and making around $70,000 a year as a software engineer for the Department of Defense.As a first-generation American from a farming family in Mexico, Kinoshita believed the best way to finally achieve the American dream her family had for her was to own property.\"I had my first big girl job and thought the next responsible thing to do would be to buy a house,\" Kinoshita tells CNBC Make It. \"I didn't necessarily want to buy a house. In fact, I was trying to figure out how to finesse the purchase.\"Initially, Kinoshita was seeking a property with the intent to sublet some of the bedrooms and lower her share of the expenses. She had about $20,000 saved for a down payment.\"My vision for the future was to be able to have a family and spend as much time with them and not necessarily have an office job. [But] I still went forward with what made sense for this American Dream path,\" she says.\"I was 28 at the time, so I still kind of cared what my community defined as successful, and homeownership was part of that. At the time, I thought it was the responsible thing to do.\"Kinoshita always believed achieving the American Dream meant owning property.Anita KinoshitaKinoshita wanted to learn as much as she could about the home-buying journey she was embarking on. She enrolled in a nine-week course that teaches people how to manage their money, offered by Financial Peace University.During the retirement module of the online class, Kinoshita used a retirement calculator that helped her realize that if she started contributing a bit more to her 401(k), she could retire around age 55 and buy a house at the same time.\"All of a sudden, the vision I had for the future and the freedom and lifestyle I wanted became possible in my mind for the first time,\" she says.For two years, Kinoshita looked at least a dozen places and put in a total of four offers. She got accepted for one, but then the sellers backed out. She was also approved for a single-family home, but there was a mismatch in the appraisal, so she walked away from the deal.\"I ended up backing out because the only way to be competitive during that time was to invest less and save more for the down payment, and I wasn't willing to do that,\" she says.\"Ultimately, I felt like it wasn't the time for me at the moment, and I was not willing to invest less either. I wasn't satisfied with my career and felt like I was living my dad's dream and not really mine.\"Kinoshita viewed a dozen properties and put in a total of four offers.Anita KinoshitaRedefining successKinoshita switched her focus. Instead of saving for a down payment, she set a goal of having $500,000 invested in her retirement accounts. By April 2022, she had invested $200,000 and reached COAST FIRE — a strategy where you save and invest enough to eventually stop contributing to your retirement accounts and let the compound growth continue rising so you're on track to have a traditional retirement. She decided to quit her job.Kinoshita isn't alone in choosing to wait to buy a house. The median age of a first-time home buyer has gone up in recent years, from 35 in 2023 to 38 in 2024 alone, according to a report from the National Association of Realtors.After quitting her full-time job, Kinoshita started working part-time, creating curriculum for California State University, Monterey Bay and making financial literacy content online. Both of these positions made her more money than when she was working as a software engineer.Kinoshita, now 34, is going to wait until she reaches early COAST FIRE, which, when you have enough invested, lets you stop contributing by the age you decide, versus the traditional retirement age of 67. Kinoshita quit her job and is now making financial literacy content online.Anita KinoshitaHer projected retirement age is now 45, and she expects to have $1.5 million invested by then.\"I value my time and freedom a little bit more than I value home ownership. In retrospect, I think if I had bought the house, I would have felt trapped in my career,\" she says.Kinoshita and her husband recently moved to the California neighborhood where they would one day like to own a home. They pay $4,000 a month in rent and live in a single-family home in a gated community, according to documents reviewed by CNBC Make It.When the couple is ready to buy, she estimates they will have about $300,000 saved to put toward the home. But they still don't know when they will start getting serious about buying.\"I'm not in a rush. I don't want to use it as a financial tool in any way. I'm looking at it more as a luxury and less as an asset these days,\" she says. \"I would rather have my money working for me in the stock market than in real estate.\"Kinoshita and her husband are now renting in the neighborhood they hope to buy one day.Anita KinoshitaKinoshita says her definition of a dream home has also changed.\"I don't want too many bedrooms. I think what I care more about these days is the charming architecture. I don't want it to be overwhelming in terms of square footage. I want it to be in a really beautiful neighborhood where I feel safe. I want to look outside and see nature,\" she says.\"I don't see a reason to settle for something else, so for us it's a as long as it takes kind of thing.\"Want to level up your AI skills? Sign up for Smarter by CNBC Make It's new online course, How To Use AI To Communicate Better At Work.

    "body": "For millions of Americans, it is an uncertain time.Amazon, General Motors and Paramount have all been making layoffs, and U.S.-based employers announced 153,074 job cuts in October altogether, according to research firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas.The government shutdown has also left hundreds of thousands of workers without pay, millions of SNAP recipients without funds to feed themselves and their families, and now thousands of travelers with reduced flight options.There are ways to cope that don't exacerbate the financial anxiety you might be feeling. For example, financial therapist Aja Evans recommends leaning into self-care activities that cost little to no money, like going outside and spending time with family and friends.But there's a mindset shift people can make as well.Instead of experiencing uncertainty as an anomaly, remember that \"uncertainty is fundamental reality,\" says best-selling author and wellness guru Deepak Chopra. \"Every moment we breathe, live and move in uncertainty, pretending that it's certainty.\"Start with the presumption that life is uncertain.Deepak ChopraWellness guru, authorThe 79-year-old recently launched a wellness platform offering various meditations, live digital sessions with him and a Deepak Chopra AI chatbot drawing from his decades of writing and talks that users can interact with directly.Instead of thinking of uncertainty as an inhibitor in your life, think of it as a chance to try something new. \"In every uncertain event,\" says Chopra, \"there is the seed for a greater opportunity and creativity.\"That creativity can lead to fresh problem solving in whatever difficult circumstance you're facing and solutions you haven't considered before.Creativity is \"a new story, a new paradigm, a new way of dealing with relationships, new context and new meaning,\" he says.When you feel that anxiety creeping in about an unclear future, \"start with the presumption that life is uncertain,\" says Chopra. \"When you start with that, you welcome the unknown.\"Want to level up your AI skills? Sign up for Smarter by CNBC Make It's new online course, How To Use AI To Communicate Better At Work.

He is very passionate about shareholder rights and good corporate governance and will go to extreme lengths to fight incompetent boards and over compensated managers. Icahn has invested across all sectors over his more than six-decade long career and has a long history in the automotive parts and services industry. He has been involved in several mergers and acquisitions in this space, acquiring some of his portfolio companies through Icahn Automotive, the automotive-segment business of his conglomerate, Icahn Enterprises. This includes his acquisition of Pep Boys-Manny Moe and Jack in 2016 and Federal Mogul in 2017.What's happeningOn Nov. 5, Carl Icahn filed a 13D with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, disclosing a 14.79% position in Monro.Behind the scenesMonro is engaged in the provision of automotive undercar repair and tire services in the United States, operating more than 1,100 repair shops and tire dealers in 32 states under multiple regional brands. The company has faced several challenges in recent years. Macro factors like lower consumer demand, higher material and labor costs, and a trend in consumer trade-down to lower margin tire products have applied significant margin and growth pressure. As a result, following a 4.9% decrease in sales for fiscal year 2025 — the second year in a row with a meaningful decline in revenue — the company announced that they are closing approximately 145 underperforming locations. Most recently, the company's third-quarter earnings report left a lot of investors disappointed about its strategic transition, with weaker-than-expected revenue and no specific financial guidance for the upcoming fiscal year. Shares fell 16.7% the next day. Lastly, many investors have questioned the company's dividend payout ratio, which has remained relatively large despite these ongoing struggles. Putting all this together, it comes as little surprise that shares have underperformed, down 44.73%, 66.73% and 63.25% over the past 1-, 3- and 5-year periods, respectively, prior to Icahn's announcement.Perhaps this depressed valuation is what caught the eye of Carl Icahn. He disclosed a 14.79% position in the company (67% of which was acquired since the stock's Oct. 29 downturn), immediately sending the stock up over 15%. While there are plenty of cheap stocks, this isn't Icahn taking a flyer on the automotive industry. Icahn has a rich history in the automotive parts and services industry, most notably Icahn Automotive, the automotive segment of his conglomerate, Icahn Enterprises. Icahn knows this industry well and likely sees Monro as a great business that is significantly undervalued. The timing of this public engagement is also very notable. It is not just the stock's recent fall that makes this a good entry point for an investor like Icahn. Monro recently agreed to collapse its dual class share structure, which had previously granted its sole Class C shareholder, Peter Solomon, veto power over any matter brought to a shareholder vote, effectively making this a controlled company. Pursuant to its approval in 2023, this collapse will occur prior to the 2026 annual meeting, which is expected to take place next August. So, what does this mean for the company's shareholders? It effectively sets the stage for the company being converted from a privately run company to a publicly run company for the benefit of its shareholders. With one person having veto power over all material board decisions, the rest of the board becomes somewhat irrelevant. With this conversion, the company has an opportunity to have a real, collaborative, and productive board. This would require its reconstitution, and we know of nobody better or more experienced than Icahn for that endeavor.Solomon is an 87-year-old renowned investment banker and Icahn is, well, Icahn and a contemporary of Solomon. However, there is no evidence that the two have ever crossed paths. Despite this, we would imagine that they have many relationships in common and mutual respect for each other. While there are many different ways this campaign can go down, what we would like to see is the two elder statesmen meeting in a room with an air of civility and cordiality uncommon in the average activist engagement and together coming up with a board that will oversee management, hold them accountable on behalf of shareholders and usher the company through its first real phase as a truly public company. With Solomon already agreeing to give up control, and neither Solomon nor Icahn likely to be on the continuing board, there is no reason why this should get contentious.However, we also must address the elephant in the room. Icahn has built his automotive industry on acquisitions, and Monro appears to fit in very nicely in IEP's automotive business. Icahn has launched activist campaigns at some of the auto companies that he later went on to acquire, including Pep Boys-Manny Moe and Jack in 2016 and Federal Mogul in 2017. When Icahn acquired Pep Boys he also stated: \"We believe that with our abundant resources and knowledge of the industry we will be able to grow this business and take advantage of consolidation opportunities, thereby benefiting customers, manufacturing partners and employees, as well as our shareholders.\" While we sincerely believe that Icahn's main motivation for this investment is to invest in a good company that he believes is at an inflection point and is significantly undervalued, there is always the chance that he might want to own the entire company one day. This is a very small position for him and a good return would not move the needle as much as a synergistic integration into his automative business, but we see no reason why both things cannot be true.Ken Squire is the founder and president of 13D Monitor, an institutional research service on shareholder activism, and the founder and portfolio manager of the 13D Activist Fund, a mutual fund that invests in a portfolio of activist investments.",

The food stamp program, now known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), may run out of funding on November 1st due to the federal government shutdown, which is now entering its second month. In Miami-Dade County, nearly one in six residents receives food assistance. (Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)Joe Raedle | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesThe Supreme Court on Friday night temporarily paused a federal judge's order that directed the Trump administration to pay full SNAP benefits to 42 million Americans for November by the end of the day.The move came hours after the 1st Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals in Boston denied the administration's emergency request to halt the order relating to food stamp benefits to primarily low-income people.But the appeals court also said it would soon rule on whether the administration was entitled to a stay of the order by U.S. District Court in Rhode Island Judge Jack McConnell while its appeal of the order plays out.Supreme Court Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, in the order on Friday night in favor of the administration, pushed the 1st Circuit to quickly determine whether to issue that stay.\"The applicants assert that, without intervention from this Court, they will have to 'transfer an estimated $4 billion by tonight' to fund SNAP benefits through November,\" Jackson wrote.That money was to come from so-called Section 32 funds that the Trump administration said it did not want to use to augment a partial payment of SNAP benefits that federal officials planned to make. The partial benefits payment would come from $4.6 billion in contingency funds set aside by Congress for that purpose.The administration originally planned not to pay any SNAP benefits in November because of the ongoing government shutdown.\"Given the First Circuit's representations, an administrative stay is required to facilitate the First Circuit's expeditious resolution of the pending stay motion,\" Jackson wrote.She said that the Supreme Court's stay \"will terminate forty-eight hours after the First Circuit's resolution of the pending motion, which the First Circuit is expected to issue with dispatch.\"That two-day window would give time for the Trump administration, or plaintiffs in the case, to return to the Supreme Court to challenge any ruling by the 1st Circuit.It is not clear to what extent Jackson's order will affect payments of SNAP benefits.The U.S. Department of Agriculture earlier Friday told states it would begin disbursing full SNAP benefits to comply with McConnell's order, even as the administration appealed the ruling.The USDA's memo did not suggest that the administration would renege on that plan even if a higher court blocked the order.The Associated Press reported late Friday that more than half a dozen states had \"confirmed that some SNAP recipients already were issued full November payments on Friday.\"New York Attorney General Letitia James, in a statement on Jackson's order, said, \"This decision is a tragedy for the millions of Americans who rely on SNAP to feed their families.\"\"It is disgraceful that the Trump administration chose to fight this in court instead of fulfilling its responsibility to the American people,\" said James, whose state is one of the plaintiffs in another pending lawsuit seeking for force full SNAP benefits to be paid.\"Every day the federal government delays is another day that children, seniors, and families face real pain and suffering,\" Read more CNBC government shutdown coverageSenate Republicans reject Democrat deal to reopen governmentDemocratic leader offers deal to reopen government but Republicans sneerTrump admin asks Supreme Court to block order it pay full SNAP benefitsSNAP benefits must be fully paid by Trump administration by Friday, judge ordersDC sandwich thrower Sean Dunn found not guilty of assaulting federal agentJudge dismisses criminal case against Boeing over Max crashes despite skepticismNancy Pelosi announces retirement from CongressTrump bashes Mamdani after Democrats sweep key electionsSupreme Court justices appear skeptical that Trump tariffs are legalCalifornia voters approve new U.S. House map to boost Democrats in 2026Democrats win big on election night in key racesThe administration last week said it would not pay any SNAP benefits in November because of the federal shutdown, which began on Oct. 1 when Congress failed to pass a bill to provide short-term funding for federal programs, including food stamps. Past administrations have paid the benefits during other shutdowns.A group of plaintiffs, comprised of cities, unions, nonprofits, and a retailer, then sued the administration in Rhode Island federal court, asking McConnell to order that full benefits be paid for the month.McConnell on Oct. 31 ordered the administration to disburse at least partial SNAP benefits as soon as possible by tapping the contingency fund.He also ordered the administration to explore whether other pools of previously appropriated money could be used to fully fund SNAP, which costs about $8 billion per month.The administration on Monday said it would pay 50% of SNAP benefits in November by using the contingency funds. But it refused to use another $4 billion from a Section 32 fund that would have made up the difference in the SNAP payments. The administration two days later said a re-calculation found it could pay 65% of the SNAP benefits from the contingency fund.The plaintiffs then urged McConnell to order the administration to make the full SNAP payments from available funds. The judge did so on Thursday, saying at a hearing that the administration's decision to rule out Section 32 funds was \"arbitrary and capricious.\" \"People have gone without for too long,\" McConnell said.\"The evidence shows that people will go hungry, food pantries will be overburdened, and needless suffering will occur\" if SNAP is not fully funded, he wrote in an order.The administration on Friday morning asked the 1st Circuit appeals court to block McConnell's order, even as the USDA issued its memo to states saying that it intended to comply with the ruling.On Friday night, a three-judge panel on that appeals court denied the administration's request.The panel noted that \"the government has not disputed that it may under [federal law] use the Section 32 fund to cover the provision of SNAP benefits for\" November.But the panel also said that the \"government's motion for a stay pending appeal [of McConnell's order] remains pending, and we intend to issue a decision on that motion as quickly as possible.\"",

Samuel Corum | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesMore than 5,000 U.S. flights were delayed on Saturday due to air traffic controller shortages, and the country's airlines will have to cut hundreds more flights next week if Congress can't come to a solution to end the government shutdown — now the longest in U.S. history.Trump administration officials this week ordered airlines to start cutting flights at 40 busy U.S. airports on Friday, blaming \"increased reports of strain on the system from both pilots and air traffic controllers\" in large part due to the shutdown.Late Friday, Senate Republicans rejected a Democrat proposal to reopen the government.Air traffic controllers, along with airport security screeners, are required to work during the shutdown without receiving their regular paychecks. Federal workers will miss their second full paycheck on Monday, according to their union. Some controllers have taken second jobs to make ends meet, union officials have said.Close to 1,650 U.S. flights were canceled on Saturday as of 5:30 p.m. ET, about half that number previously announced by the airlines that had 21,748 scheduled for the day. That share of cancellations was on par with severe thunderstorms, which can be disruptive, though they're routine. Cirium said Friday ranked as the 72nd worst for cancellations since Jan. 1, 2024.Under the FAA's order, the flight cuts will increase to 6% of schedules, 8% by Thursday and 10% next Friday. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy told Fox News on Friday that cuts could eventually reach up to 20% of schedules, although he didn't elaborate. Airlines weren't required to cut international flights.watch nowThe disruptions are occurring at a generally low travel season, but the key Thanksgiving holiday weekend is less than three weeks away. The impact for airlines could quadruple given how fares during that high-demand period spike, Seaport Research Partners airline analyst Daniel McKenzie said in a note on Friday.Airlines this week waived date-change fees for travelers on affected flights and noted they can also request a refund. Airline executives stated that many customers were being rebooked on alternative flights, while last-minute changes sent others scrambling for other arrangements. Hertz, for example, stated on Thursday that, when the FAA made its flight-cut announcement, one-way car rentals increased by 20% over the same two-day period a year earlier.Delays rose throughout the day Saturday, with more than 5,400 late U.S. flights, according to FlightAware. Air traffic control staffing shortages prompted delays at airports including Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport, San Francisco International Airport, John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York, Newark Liberty International Airport in New Jersey, Houston's George Bush Intercontinental Airport and Chicago O'Hare International Airport.Here are the airports where the FAA and DOT cuts apply:Impacted airports:ANC - Anchorage InternationalATL - Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta InternationalBOS - Boston Logan InternationalBWI - Baltimore/Washington InternationalCLT - Charlotte Douglas InternationalCVG - Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky InternationalDAL - Dallas LoveDCA - Ronald Reagan Washington NationalDEN - Denver InternationalDFW - Dallas/Fort Worth InternationalDTW - Detroit Metropolitan Wayne CountyEWR - Newark Liberty InternationalFLL - Fort Lauderdale/Hollywood InternationalHNL - Honolulu InternationalHOU - Houston HobbyIAD - Washington Dulles InternationalIAH - George Bush Houston IntercontinentalIND - Indianapolis InternationalJFK - New York John F.

    "body": "\"Neighbors need food NOW,\" the homepage of Second Harvest Food Bank of South Louisiana reads.Amid uncertainty around SNAP funding, food banks across the U.S. are scrambling to pick up the slack for the 42 million Americans who rely on the program for food assistance.SNAP payments have been paused since Nov. 1 due to the government shutdown. On Thursday, a federal judge ordered the Trump administration to restore full funding for the program by Nov. 7. The administration quickly appealed the ruling and on Friday sought an emergency block on the order.While the larger legal battle continues, several states have said that they've started to process full food stamp payments, the New York Times reports.CNBC Make It spoke with leaders at several food banks about how they're responding to the challenges caused by SNAP cuts and the government shutdown.Brian Greene, the president and CEO of Houston Food Bank, describes the situation as \"a rolling disaster.\"SNAP payments are typically distributed on a staggered monthly schedule in Texas, Greene says, which means that each day since the beginning of November, another 125,000 Texans run out of EBT funds.As the shutdown drags on, a growing number of furloughed federal workers in Houston are turning to food banks for assistance, Greene says.\"Every day that this keeps going, the damage gets worse and worse,\" he says.Facing 'a great increase in need'According to Leslie Bacho, CEO of Second Harvest of Silicon Valley, the effects of the SNAP disruption are already becoming clear.Within its service area of Santa Clara and San Mateo counties, more than 168,000 people rely on CalFresh, the state of California's version of SNAP, Bacho says.On Monday alone, over 1,500 unique users visited the bank's online food locator tool, which connects people to nearby food distribution sites, according to Bacho. That's nearly double the usual volume.Their hotline has also experienced a 200% increase in requests for referrals, she says.\"We're in the process of ordering additional food and really trying to ramp up for what we think will be a great increase in need,\" Bacho says.Jon Toups, the CEO of Second Harvest Food Bank of South Louisiana, says his organization was \"stretched thin\" even before the SNAP delays.The Louisiana legislature has stepped in to help provide reserve funds for SNAP users, he says, but USDA cuts earlier this year had already caused supply shortages for food banks.There's \"no question\" that there's been an uptick in demand for food assistance in the past week, Toups says, and \"we're seeing an awful lot of anxiousness.\"For every meal that food banks provide, SNAP provides nine, Toups says, creating an even larger chasm of need for banks to fill.\"The shutdown is putting an additional strain on the food bank network when we can least afford it,\" he says.How food banks are respondingAbout 425,000 Houston households rely on SNAP, Greene says, and in order to meet their typical level of need, Houston Food Bank would have to double its output.They're currently using all available resources — Greene gave the bank's procurement team the go-ahead to \"spend what [they] need to spend\" — in an effort to increase output by about 50%.Right now, Houston Food Bank is in \"disaster response mode,\" Greene says.They've set up special distribution sites specifically targeting federal employees and SNAP users in parking lots across the city, including at Houston's NRG Stadium.Houston residents line up in their cars for a special free food distribution by the Houston Food Bank at the NRG Stadium in Houston, Texas, on Nov. 1, 2025.Mark Felix | AFP | Getty ImagesIt costs around $15,000 to set up one of these \"supersites,\" according to Greene, and they're \"pulling in more volunteers and paying a lot of extra expenses,\" he says.At Second Harvest Food Bank South Louisiana, Toups requested to use a \"pretty significant\" amount of the bank's reserve funds to purchase more food, he says.He's also working to spread the word about the food bank's situation.\"Our community has really stepped up. We've seen an uptick in donations, not only financially speaking, but with their time, which is a huge piece for us,\" he says.Still, staff are \"overrun right now,\" he says: \"I almost feel like I'm asking them to work 24/7 right now to stay out in front of this.\"\"We will always do the best we can do,\" Toups says, but their current situation \"is not sustainable.\"Second Harvest Silicon Valley is in \"drop everything mode\" working to allocate 15% more food to each of their distribution sites, Bacho says.Crucially, while the charitable food system is already \"very, very strained,\" the last thing Bacho wants is for people in need to worry that banks will run out of food.\"Whether that involves going into our reserves, whether it involves raising more from our community or from our greater partnerships with our counties, we're going to do everything we can to meet that increase in need,\" she says.Still 'just at the beginning' of crisisBoth Toups and Greene liken the current situation to the aftermath of a natural disaster — but in those situations, \"the federal government was there to help,\" Greene says.\"In this case, the federal government is the cause, not the solution,\" he says.Right now, local giving is keeping many food banks and aid organizations afloat, according to Greene.\"If philanthropy holds up, we can keep doing this for quite some time,\" he says, but \"in a crisis, philanthropy shoots up, but it comes right back down.\"There are a few ways that people can support food banks right now, according to Toups.Primarily, food banks need monetary donations. That's the \"most efficient\" way to help, he says, \"because it allows me to actually use that money to go do exactly what's needed at that moment in time.\"Volunteers can also help food banks with tasks like sorting donations, packing boxes and distributing food, he says.At the end of the day, though, \"we've got to get back to some level of normalcy,\" Toups says.Right now, \"we're just at the beginning of this crisis,\" according to Bacho. As more days pass without SNAP funding, the demands on food banks will only increase, she says.\"We need this man-made problem in Washington, D.C. to resolve itself,\" Toups says.Want to level up your AI skills? Sign up for Smarter by CNBC Make It's new online course, How To Use AI To Communicate Better At Work.

    "body": "watch nowFed Governor Stephen Miran on Friday suggested that surging demand for dollar-denominated stablecoins could help push U.S. interest rates lower.In a speech delivered for an audience of economists in New York, the central bank official and appointee of President Donald Trump said the flood of crypto tokens pegged to the dollar could tamp down what economists refer to as \"r-star,\" or the \"neutral\" rate of interest that neither pushes nor impedes growth.If that happens, he said, the Fed might need to lower its own policy rate to avoid unintentionally slowing the economy.\"Stablecoins may become a multitrillion-dollar elephant in the room for central bankers,\" Miran said. \"Stablecoins are already increasing demand for U.S. Treasury bills and other dollar-denominated liquid assets by purchasers outside the United States, and this demand will continue growing.\"Citing prior research, Miran said stablecoin growth could push the Fed's benchmark rate down by 0.4 percentage point.During his short time on the Fed board, Miran has advocated aggressive rate cuts, in part because he thinks the neutral rate is considerably lower than most of his colleagues assume. His latest remarks extend that argument into the world of digital finance, suggesting that the rise of stablecoins could structurally lower borrowing costs for years to come.Previously, his arguments have been focused largely on moderating inflation and the importance of the Fed not impeding economic growth with higher rates. The stablecoin dissertation adds another wrinkle to the case for easier policy.\"Even relatively conservative estimates of stablecoin growth imply an increase in the net supply of loanable funds in the economy that pushes down\" the neutral rate, he said. If neutral is lower, he added, \"policy rates should also be lower than they would otherwise be to support a healthy economy. A failure of the central bank to cut rates in response to a reduction in [r-star] is contractionary.\"Miran is expected to leave the Fed in January, when the unexpired term he is filling runs out.",

    "body": "US President Donald Trump makes an announcement in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington, DC on Nov. 6, 2025. Andrew Caballero-Reynolds | AFP | Getty ImagesPresident Donald Trump on Thursday struck landmark deals with Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk that could mark a turning point in how many people can access their costly blockbuster obesity drugs. Under the agreements, Medicare will start covering GLP-1s for obesity for certain patients for the first time beginning in mid-2026 – a shift that will open access to millions of older adults and could spur more employers and other private insurers to follow suit, some experts said. Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly are also lowering the prices that all state Medicaid programs will pay for GLP-1s, but it's up to states to opt into coverage. Obesity drug coverage among state Medicaid plans, employers and other private insurers remains spotty due to the $1,000 or more monthly list prices of existing GLP-1s, including Eli Lilly's obesity injection Zepbound and Novo Nordisk's competitor Wegovy. The limited insurance coverage has blocked out patients who can't afford their hefty price tags. That lack of access has led to mounting pressure on health plans and the government to expand coverage — and the government agreements with drugmakers could mark a major shift.\"I think it'll start with the government, start with Medicare, and the insurers will quickly follow,\" Nick Fabrizio, an associate teaching professor in Cornell's health policy program, told CNBC. \"I do think that's coming.\"\"This is a great step towards trying to address a chronic and serious issue, and for those patients who may feel like they have no hope,\" he said.Roughly 8 to 9 million people in the U.S. are using GLP-1s, Eli Lilly CEO David Ricks said at a briefing with reporters on Thursday. The added Medicare coverage under the deal could bring in as many as 40 million new eligible patients, and prompt more commercial plans to cover the medicines, he said.The deals could also address the inability of many patients with limited or no insurance coverage for obesity drugs to access them, by offering the treatments at a discount on the Trump administration's direct-to-consumer website, TrumpRx.gov. The monthly out-of-pocket cost of existing injections and upcoming pills could range from $50 to $350 starting next year, depending on the dosage and insurance coverage a patient has. Still, there is a law prohibiting Medicare from covering weight loss drugs, so any changes would have to come from Congress. Eli Lilly's Ricks told reporters Thursday that for now, the government will launch an initial pilot program in the spring of 2026 under a temporary legal mechanism. It would be voluntary for Medicare prescription drug plans, so \"it may be possible that a few plans do not participate, but I would expect almost all do,\" he said. But Ricks said that it will transition into a formal so-called Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation pilot program in 2027, which means it will be mandatory for all Medicare Part D plans.\"So we expect broad coverage in all plans both in 2026 and beyond,\" he said.Medicare coverage could be a sea changeLikely the most notable feature of the deals is Medicare coverage of obesity drugs, as it will allow the treatments to reach new patients in the program and could lead to broader private insurance coverage. Under the deals, Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk agreed to cut the price Medicare and Medicaid pay for GLP-1s to $245 per month. In Medicare specifically, certain patients will pay a copay of $50 per month for all approved uses of injectable and oral GLP-1 drugs, including diabetes and obesity treatment.But the Trump administration is putting some constraints on which Medicare beneficiaries will be eligible to receive GLP-1s for obesity and cardiovascular and metabolic benefits. People who qualify include patients with a body mass index of 27 or above with prediabetes or established cardiovascular disease; people with a BMI of 30 or more with related health conditions; or those with severe obesity, or a BMI of 35 and above. GLP-1s for weight loss are approved for a broader population: people who have obesity or are overweight with one related condition. In a note Thursday, Leerink Partners analyst David Risinger also said it's unclear whether the government will allow patients to stay on a GLP-1 for obesity after their BMI levels drop. Even with those restrictions, \"I think in practice, it's still going to cover a fair number of people,\" said Darius Lakdawalla, chief scientific officer at the University of Southern California's Schaeffer Center.JPMorgan analyst Chris Schott said the eligibility criteria mean 80% of the obese population in Medicare could receive coverage for GLP-1s, despite the limits.\"Today's deal will open up meaningful access to obesity drugs,\" Schott said in a note about Eli Lilly on Thursday. Lakdawalla added that while there isn't clear evidence that private insurers will expand coverage on the heels of government plans, \"it's just optically harder for them to continue to constrain coverage when Medicare and Medicaid are covering them.\" \"That's going to exert some pressure for commercial coverage of these drugs to expand as well,\" Lakdawalla said. Coverage for GLP-1s for obesity has ticked up slightly, but remains sparse: A May survey of more than 300 companies by the International Foundation of Employee Benefit Plans found that 36% provided coverage for GLP-1s for both weight loss and diabetes, up from 34% in 2024. Medicaid, direct-to-consumer offerings could fill gapsLakdawalla said the direct-to-consumer offerings under the deal could be useful for people who are underinsured, uninsured or may not have coverage for obesity medicines. Still, it's unclear how many more patients the drugs will reach due to the offerings. Both Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk have introduced lower cost options for their drugs for people paying in cash and purchasing the drugs directly through their websites. But the deals with Trump will give those patients even bigger discounts.On TrumpRx, the average monthly cost for Wegovy, Zepbound and other injectable GLP-1s will start at $350 and drop to $250 within the next two years, according to senior Trump administration officials. Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk both offered some GLP-1s on their direct-to-consumer platforms for up to $450 to $500 per month.Starting doses of obesity pills from Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk — expected to hit the market next year — will be $149 per month on TrumpRx, Medicare and Medicaid.  Eli Lilly on Thursday said it would lower prices by $50 on its own direct-to-consumer platform, LillyDirect, which already offers Zepbound and other drugs at a discount to cash-paying patients. The multidose pen of Zepbound will be available for $299 per month at the lowest dose, with additional doses being priced up to $449 per month.In terms of Medicaid, Cornell's Fabrizio said states will likely want to start covering obesity drugs at the lower price point, \"but the question is how will they pay for it?\"Around a dozen state Medicaid programs cover obesity drugs, according to 2024 estimates from KFF, a health policy research organization. While GLP-1s offer substantial health benefits to Medicaid beneficiaries, state programs are already facing constrained budgets and administrative demands.Fabrizio added that raising taxes to cover the drugs \"could be a sticky issue.\"Still, JPMorgan's Schott said offering lower prices to Medicaid programs could lead to a \"significant increase in coverage\" in that channel, where Zepbound has very limited uptake. ",

    "body": "U.S. President Donald Trump gestures as he speaks during an event to announce a deal with Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk to reduce the prices of GLP-1 weight‑loss drugs, in the Oval Office at the White House in Washington, D.C., U.S., November 6, 2025. Jonathan Ernst | ReutersPresident Donald Trump proposed a compromise on health insurance payments, calling on Republicans to send federal payments that would go to insurers under the Affordable Care Act directly to Americans to bring an end to the government shutdown.\"I am recommending to Senate Republicans that the Hundreds of Billions of Dollars currently being sent to money sucking Insurance Companies in order to save the bad Healthcare provided by ObamaCare, BE SENT DIRECTLY TO THE PEOPLE SO THAT THEY CAN PURCHASE THEIR OWN, MUCH BETTER, HEALTHCARE, and have money left over,\" he wrote in a Truth Social post on Saturday, without providing any details.The post comes one day after Senate Republicans rejected Democratic Minority Leader Chuck Schumer's deal that would have allowed the U.S. government to reopen after a shutdown that began Oct. 1. The shutdown is now the longest in U.S. history.The plan Democrats put forward on Friday proposed protecting federal ACA subsidies for at least one year, in exchange for dropping their demand that a longer-term extension of Obamacare tax credits be included in a stopgap government funding bill.Those subsidies, which more than 20 million Americans use, will expire at the end of December if Congress does not extend them.Read more CNBC government shutdown coverageSenate Republicans reject Democrat deal to reopen governmentDemocratic leader offers deal to reopen government but Republicans sneerTrump admin asks Supreme Court to block order it pay full SNAP benefitsSNAP benefits must be fully paid by Trump administration by Friday, judge ordersDC sandwich thrower Sean Dunn found not guilty of assaulting federal agentJudge dismisses criminal case against Boeing over Max crashes despite skepticismNancy Pelosi announces retirement from CongressTrump bashes Mamdani after Democrats sweep key electionsSupreme Court justices appear skeptical that Trump tariffs are legalCalifornia voters approve new U.S. House map to boost Democrats in 2026Democrats win big on election night in key racesSenate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., on Friday called the Democrats' proposal a \"non-starter.\"The White House did not immediately respond to a CNBC request for comment or specifics on how Trump's proposed direct payment plan would work.Representatives for Sens. Schumer and Thune did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The D.C. offices for House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., and House Minority Leader Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Congressional lawmakers have been in a stalemate, unable to find a compromise to end the shutdown. Democrats want a funding bill to include health-care subsidies that are due to expire for 24 million Americans at year's end. Republicans, meanwhile, say Congress must first pass a funding bill without strings attached and allow the government to reopen before tackling other issues.In multiple posts on Saturday, Trump also reiterated his calls for terminating the filibuster, the Senate rule requiring 60 of its 100 members to pass most legislation. The GOP holds 53 seats in the Senate. There are 45 Democratic senators, and two independents who caucus with them.Senate Republicans have pushed back on changing the rule, saying earlier this week they would not support a change. Trump had called for his party to exercise what he called \"the Nuclear Option\" on the rule.On Saturday, Trump alleged that he is \"making progress\" with Republicans on changing the rule.\"The Democrats are cracking like dogs on the Shutdown because they are deathly afraid that I am making progress with the Republicans on TERMINATING THE FILIBUSTER! Whether we make a Deal or not, THE REPUBLICANS MUST 'BLOW UP' THE FILIBUSTER,\" he wrote.",

    "body": "Over 95% of international data and voice call traffic travels through nearly a million miles of underwater communication cables.These cables carry government communications, financial transactions, email, video calls and streaming around the world.The first commercial telecommunication subsea cable was used for telegraphs and was laid across the English Channel between Dover, England and Calais, France in 1850.The technology then evolved to coaxial cables that carried telephone conversations, and most recently, fiber optics that ferry data and the internet as we know it.\"About ten years ago, we saw the advent of another big category, which is the webscale players and the likes of Meta, Google, Amazon, etc., who represent now probably 50% of the overall market,\" said Paul Gabla, chief sales officer at Alcatel Submarine Networks.Alcatel is the world's largest subsea cable manufacturer and installer, according to industry trade magazine Submarine Telecoms Forum.Demand for subsea cables is increasing as tech giants race to develop computation-intensive artificial intelligence models and connect their growing networks of data centers.Investment into new subsea cable projects is expected to reach around $13 billion between 2025-2027, almost twice the amount that was invested between 2022 and 2024, according to telecommunications data provider firm TeleGeography.A map of the world's undersea communication cables.CNBC | Jason ReginatoBig Tech, big cables\"AI is increasing the need that we have for subsea infrastructure,\" said Alex Aime, vice president of network investments at Meta. \"Oftentimes when people think about AI, they think about data centers, they think about compute, they think about data. But the reality is, without the connectivity that connects those data centers, what you have are really expensive warehouses.\"In February, the company announced Project Waterworth, a 50,000km (31,000-mile) cable that will connect five continents, making it the world's longest subsea cable project.Meta will be the sole owner of Waterworth, which the company says will be a multi-year, multi-billion-dollar project.Amazon also recently announced its first wholly-owned subsea cable project called Fastnet.Fastnet will connect Maryland's eastern shore to County Cork, Ireland, and capacity will exceed 320 terabits per second, which is equivalent to streaming 12.5 million HD movies simultaneously, according to Amazon.\"Subsea is really essential for AWS and for any connectivity internationally across oceans,\" Matt Rehder, Amazon Web Services vice president of core networking, told CNBC in an interview about Amazon's subsea cable investments. \"Without subsea you'd have to rely on satellite connectivity, which can work. But satellite has higher latency, higher costs, and you just can't get enough capacity or throughput to what our customers and the internet in general needs.\"A ship belonging to Alcatel Submarine Networks deploys a plow to install subsea telecommunications cables.Alcatel Submarine NetworksGoogle is another large player, having invested in over 30 subsea cables.One of the company's latest projects is Sol, which will connect the U.S., Bermuda, the Azores and Spain.Microsoft has also invested in the infrastructure.\"You've seen this huge growth in submarine cables over the past 20 years. And this is driven by just a voracious demand for data,\" says Matthew Mooney, director of global issues at cybersecurity firm Recorded Future.Cut cablesDisruptions due to cable damage can be quite significant, particularly in areas served by few internet connections.\"If you cut a cable, you can cut off multiple countries from internet access, and that includes financial transactions, banking, e-commerce and basic communications,\" said Erin Murphy, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a nonprofit national security research organization.That very thing happened to Tonga, an island nation east of Australia.In 2022, debris from an underwater volcanic eruption severed the island's only subsea communication cable, cutting the island off from the rest of the world.In September, cuts to subsea cables in the Red Sea caused disruptions to Microsoft's Azure cloud service. The company was able to re-route traffic, but users in Asia and the Middle East still faced increased latency problems and degraded performance.Experts have said that the majority of subsea cable damage is accidental, usually due to fishing activity or a ship accidentally dropping its anchor on a cable. But lately, these cables are becoming the suspected targets of sabotage.A subsea cable being manufactured at Alcatel Submarine Networks factory in Calais, France.CNBC\"When you have so many vessels in international waters that are highly trafficked by lots of commercial vessels or fishing vessels, the likelihood of accidents is fairly high,\" Murphy said. \"But if you're a hostile actor, you know that as well. So if you're sending out the so-called Russian ghost fleet, or if you have a Chinese fishing vessel and a cable is accidentally cut, you could just say, 'Oh, well, it was an accident.' But it could be intentional. So it's really hard to discern sometimes when an act of damage is actually intentional or accidental.\"Mooney and Recorded Future have been tracking some of these cases of suspected sabotage.\"I would say that we have seen a significant uptick in what we would consider intentional damages,\" Mooney said. \"In 2024 and 2025, [we] saw a notable increase in incidents that occurred in the Baltic Sea and around Taiwan. And so it is difficult to be able to determine with 100% validity that these are intentional. However, the fact patterns that emerge from these events does give you cause to be suspicious that they could all be considered accidental.\"Mooney said the increase in suspected sabotage has corresponded to increased tensions between Russia and Ukraine and China and Taiwan.Despite there being a lack of concrete evidence of subsea cable sabotage, governments are taking the threat seriously.In January, NATO launched the \"Baltic Sentry\" following several incidents of cable cuts in the Baltic Sea. The operation involves deploying drones, aircraft and subsea and surface vessels to safeguard the subsea infrastructure in the region.\"As a result, I don't believe we've seen any instances of cable severing since late January 2025, in the Baltic Sea,\" Mooney said.A picture taken on February 4, 2025 shows a Helicopter 15 (HKP15) (L) on the flight deck of patrol ship HMS Carlskrona (P04) on open water near Karlskrona, Sweden, as part of the NATO Baltic Sea patrol mission, the Baltic Sentry, aimed to secure critical underwater infrastructure. The patrol ship HMS Carlskrona (P04) set off from the naval port in Karlskrona on February 4, 2025 to become part of NATO's Baltic Sentry operation as one of several Swedish ships that are part of Standing NATO Maritime Group One (SNMG1). This is the first time the ship has hoisted the NATO flag on board. The purpose of NATO's Baltic Sentry operation is to demonstrate presence and secure critical underwater infrastructure.

We also spoke to government officials and tech giants to find out why subsea cables are crucial to keeping us connected and what we can do to protect this critical infrastructure.Watch the video to get the full story.",

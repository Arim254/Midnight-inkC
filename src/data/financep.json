    "body": "Dustin Muskovitz, co-founder and chairman at Asana.Stefanie Keenan | Getty Images Entertainment | Getty ImagesMeta's co-founder Dustin Moskovitz opened up about the pains of leadership and admitted that 13 years of being a CEO was \"exhausting.\"Moskovitz, one of the original founders of Meta, formerly Facebook, co-founded the social platform in 2004 alongside Mark Zuckerberg, Eduardo Saverin, Chris Hughes, and Andrew McCollum.After leaving Facebook in 2008, he retained a stake of just over 8%, making him a billionaire with a net worth of $12 billion, according to the most recent data from Forbes. He went on to become a co-founder and CEO of work management software platform Asana the same year.Moskovitz announced his departure as Asana's CEO earlier this year and has transitioned into the role of chairman, while retaining an ownership of 53% of the company's outstanding shares between Class A and Class B holdings. The billionaire recently opened up about what it was like to be a CEO at Asana, while also having an introverted personality, on an episode of the Stratechery podcast by Ben Thompson, released on Monday.\"I don't like to manage teams, and it wasn't my intention when we started Asana,\" Moskovitz said during the episode.\"I'd intended to be more of a independent or head of engineering or something again. Then one thing led to another and I was CEO for 13 years and I just found it quite exhausting.\"He added: \"I'm an introvert, I had to just kind of put on this face day after day and then in the beginning I was like, 'Oh, it's going to get easier, the company will get more mature,' and then the world just kept getting more chaotic — the first Trump presidency and the pandemic and all the race stuff, it made it just a lot less of the company building, being a CEO is a lot more reacting to problems and doing this sort of thing.\"Many famous leaders are introvertsVarious notable business leaders have described themselves as being introverts, from Meta's Zuckerberg, to Microsoft's co-founder Bill Gates, and chairman and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway Warren Buffett.Susan Cain, author of \"Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking\" said introverts are often passed over for leadership positions and thrive more in quieter and less stimulating environments.She said introverts have some hidden traits that can make them well suited for leadership positions, including taking fewer risks, being more creative, and being better at problem solving.Cain said that introverted leaders can be \"slow\" and \"circumspect\" when making decisions which helps them to avoid impulsive or reckless moves.They also tend to seek out solitude more which is \"a real catalyst to creativity,\" according to Cain.\"This two-tier structure of how we view personality leads to a colossal waste of talent, and of energy and of happiness,\" Cain said. \"We need to be adopting much more of a yin and yang approach of balance between the two styles.\"",

    "body": "People who consistently achieve their goals have a few key traits in common, according to psychologist Angela Duckworth.Duckworth, a University of Pennsylvania professor and bestselling author, has spent more than 15 years studying the concept of \"grit,\" or what pushes someone to stay dedicated to — and eventually meet — their long-term goals. Many people with high levels of grit share these four qualities, she said on an October 13 episode of \"The Mel Robbins Podcast\":They pursue projects they're genuinely interested in.They practice the skills they need for those projects diligently and deliberately.They have a strong sense of purpose, meaning that they feel like they're helping other people — not just themselves.They genuinely hope that their efforts will help them improve in the future.\"When you look at people who are great at what they do ... Their mind comes to this subject and wants to stay there,\" said Duckworth, adding: \"I don't believe you can grow passion without the seed of interest.\"DON'T MISS: The ultimate guide to using AI to communicate betterIf you don't know exactly what you're passionate about or genuinely interested in, take note when the people around you say things like, \"By the way, you spend a lot of time thinking about X, Y and Z,\" said Duckworth. You may not recognize what you're interested in until you actually try something new, so do that, she advised.\"Don't think it, just do it. Stop writing in your journal. Stop asking yourself questions,\" Duckworth said. \"Literally go out and do something. Interests are like food. You've got to taste it to know whether you like it or not.\"Duckworth also highlighted the difference between low-quality practice and actual dedication to improving, using herself as an example. An avid runner, Duckworth went out running regularly, and wondered why she wasn't improving as much as she expected, she said.In response, her late mentor — psychologist Anders Ericsson — asked her some insightful questions, she said: Did she have a specific goal? Was she practicing with complete effort and concentration? Did she seek feedback on areas of improvement?\"Never,\" Duckworth said. \"I was doing low-quality practice.\"The third trait, purpose, is an oft-studied one — and feeling like you have a responsibility to other people can help keep you accountable while trying to meet a long-term goal, Robbins noted. Just be careful: Focusing too much on your big-picture purpose can make you undervalue the path or process it took to get there, author and physician Jordan Grumet wrote for CNBC Make It in April.Focusing on the process of achieving your goal, rather than the outcome, can help you live a more fulfilled life, Grumet noted: \"Unlike big audacious goals that take years or even decades to achieve, the small, more personal types of purpose are ongoing projects that are enjoyable regardless of the results.\"If you struggle with discouragement at any point, you can try a tactic that Duckworth uses herself, she said.\"I take my pen out and I put a to-do list together that is ridiculously simple, like 'Open [a] Google Doc.' Then I open the Google Doc and check it off. Small win,\" said Duckworth. \"If you break down these things that are feeling discouraging to you, you should just think to yourself, 'Too big.' Not that it's impossible.\"Want to level up your AI skills? Sign up for Smarter by CNBC Make It's new online course, How To Use AI To Communicate Better At Work.

    "body": "Laura Brown and Kristina O'Neill were at the top of their games. They had dream magazine jobs as editors in chief, with Brown at Instyle and O'Neill at WSJ. Magazine.Then they got fired.That's the term they prefer, by the way. Not part of a restructure, made redundant or laid off.\"Same s---canning, different day,\" Brown, who was fired from Instyle via Zoom in 2022, tells CNBC Make It. \"Here's an anvil that's smacked you on the head. And then you take another weight of shame [and] weird verbiage and construct some narrative for yourself that isn't even true, when everything [feels like] you're already three feet tall.\"\"It's the same feeling, no matter what you call it,\" says O'Neill, who was let go from WSJ in 2023.After meeting at a Marc Jacobs fashion show in 2001 and spending the next 20-plus years building their careers together, the two friends wrote about the blunter side of losing their jobs within a year of each other in their new book \"All the Cool Girls Get Fired.\"It's the book they didn't have when they were fired, covering severance, health insurance and bouncing back in your career with \"more professional mojo than ever,\" they write — plus personal essays from icons like Jamie Lee Curtis and Oprah about their own firing stories.CNBC Make It spoke with Brown, who's since founded her own company LB Media, and O'Neill, now the head of media at Sotheby's, about everything they learned from getting fired and writing this book:Why you shouldn't spend too much time alone after getting firedLaura Brown: It's really important to rest, but don't retreat. If you spend too much time alone, you just always feel worse. All those bad thoughts compound. So don't do that, but listen to yourself. Have a coffee with someone. Have a breakfast. You don't have to do all of them in a day. We certainly went to things after we both got fired that made us feel funny in our tummies. And we were like, 'Oh, I don't think we should have done that.' Calibrate enough to do the odd thing: Respond to an email, have a phone call, have a Zoom.Oftentimes — breaking news — when you go out of your apartment and into the world, you do feel better because you're reminded there is a whole world out there beyond you and your shrinking bank balance. There's these little options that are going to open up to you. Just be judicious about it. There's not a quota you have to hit. Do what we call 'proof of life.'If you've been good and worked hard, people will show up.Laura BrownKristina O'Neill: I call it 'The Scarlet F.' I think a lot of people feel like they're walking into a room and everyone's going to turn their heads and stare at them, like, 'Oh, she's here.' It's all in your head.Talking about it helps; calling it what it is helps; having your fired crew helps.How to approach networking: 'Take no shame in asking for stuff'LB: Networking is just getting to know people and finding opportunities. But it seems to come with this mercenary scenario: 'I'm going into a corporate party, I'm gonna network, and here's my business card.' It always sounds so aggressive. I think that we're all throughout our careers naturally networking. My husband calls it 'Johnny Appleseed-ing,' where you're slinging out seeds the whole time. And when something like this happens, if you're fired or there's a big change, there's actually an orchard that you've built with your work and your relationships.If you've been good and worked hard, people will show up. Also with the environment that we're in, there's so much more empathy in the workplace and in hiring than there ever was before.No. 1, take no shame in asking for stuff, because everyone is and everyone will. No. 2, understand the way you steer yourself might be different to what you've been grown up with, because there are different options and different schedules and different ways to make money.If you can let yourself just look around the corner and think, 'Oh, there are more and different opportunities to what I grew up with,' and then listen to yourself a little bit.Think: 'Was that my dream job, or did I not really like it that much? Did I feel like myself? Did I feel obliged? Did I feel comfortable? Sometimes you're shocked into this reevaluation that can serve you. Your financial priority is your greatest priority always. But if there's even a tiny bit of time that you can take, sometimes you don't think about these things when you're in this rote job.Disentangling your sense of self from your jobKO: If you put all of yourself into your career, when the job is taken away, everything goes. We had ourselves, each other, our friends, our family. Even if it's just liking to read or going to Pilates, very simple things that just make you feel human, that helps.It's easier said than done. When you're in a high-profile role, the way you're introduced to people is you're so-and-so of so-and-so, and suddenly you're not. The thing that surprised us with our community is so many people said, 'We don't care if you're not working for that place anymore. We still want you to come along with us.' That's a great confidence boost.Getting fired as a bossLB: I was fired with my whole team over Zoom. I kind of launched into this speech about how now, your value lies in you. Everything you achieved is yours. It's not the company's. They didn't take it from you.I remember saying, 'don't give them the power of thinking this has been done to you; don't add this on to yourself. Take everything that you've learned, all your abilities, all your skills, they're yours, and you'll be able to take them somewhere else.'Our hope and our dream for this book is that the takeaway is this level-setting on what it means to be fired and how to come through it and be strong and face what comes next.Kristina O'NeillKO: I was one of one fired. I was the boss of a team of almost 50 people. There was uncertainty around who was replacing me and how that would look, and that created a lot of anxiety for the team. As much as I wanted to hold their hands, at a certain point, I had to look out for myself.I adored my team, and we had a very close-knit relationship. We got to have a party, which was really nice. We did have closure. I think a lot of workplaces, unfortunately, when things are very abrupt, there isn't that moment for everyone to come together and just have that final hurrah. So, I highly recommend that, even if your workplace isn't going to throw the party for you. Try to have that closure when you leave, because I do think it helps you be able to move on.How to deal with everyone telling you to look at a firing as an opportunityLB: Thirty-five people are going to say 'this is the best thing that'll ever happen to you.' You are going to want to choke them all. They are, in the long game, right.I think the best thing you can do as a friend to people in these situations is two things: One's less evolved. Your friends can say, 'They suck. What a bunch of ass-----.' They can defame your employer all day long, in a way you can't. Your friends can be your worst self.And then they can help by keeping your social rhythms as they always were. So much of our employment comes from our social rhythms and keeping up with other people. Being out in the world engenders those opportunities.The biggest lessons of writing a book about being firedKO: Just how needed this conversation is. It should have been really easy to report this book in terms of having the conversations with the women who are in it. It did take us a minute to find women who are willing to be out there talking about what happened to them. Our hope and our dream for this book is that the takeaway is this level-setting on what it means to be fired and how to come through it and be strong and face what comes next.LB: Having women go, 'I just read it. This helped me. It makes me feel like I'm not alone.' That's been absolutely wild. If we can modify how women think about getting fired so there's less shame and more of a 'Yeah, I'm a cool girl' feeling, then that's a victory.This interview has been edited for length and clarity.Want to level up your AI skills? Sign up for Smarter by CNBC Make It's new online course, How To Use AI To Communicate Better At Work.

    "body": "When Rick Senko started re-selling used items on eBay, he was \"flat broke\" — a recently unemployed single father who was desperate to earn enough money to support his 5-year-old son.That was 2008, and the first item he sold — a cell phone he bought for $35 on Craigslist and flipped on eBay for $75 — felt like discovering a \"glitch in the Matrix,\" says Senko, now 41 and based in Fort Lauderdale, Florida.Realizing he could turn a tidy profit by flipping used items online, he went all in. He studied brands and sales trends, exploiting market inefficiencies and often working up to 20 hours a day \"just going to the flea market, going to the thrift store, making relationships, studying my craft, learning, listing [items] every single day,\" he says.DON'T MISS: The ultimate guide to using AI to communicate betterWhat started as a way to make ends meet slowly grew into a reselling empire, bringing in millions of dollars a year in sales as one of eBay's top sellers. In 2023, Senko started a wholesale business called Technsports that sells up to 5,000 items of used clothing per day to other professional resellers. Technsports brought in more than $6.5 million in 2024 revenue, according to documents reviewed by CNBC Make It.Technsports is profitable overall, with a profit margin of roughly 50% per item sold, Senko says.\"I have not taken a day off in almost 20 years,\" says Senko. \"It is not lost on me how fortunate I am. But it also took a tremendous amount of work, a tremendous amount of commitment, and a tremendous amount of sacrifice to get from where I came from to now selling millions of dollars per year and living a very, very fortunate life.\"'You don't need a lot of money to start'After becoming a father at age 18, Senko worked as a CVS photography lab supervisor for five years to make ends meet for himself and his son. He attended a vocational school to earn a computer repair certificate, which landed him a better-paying job at Circuit City in Fall 2008.Two weeks later, Circuit City filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. Senko found himself out of work and unable to find a new job during the Great Recession. Then, his cellphone broke. \"I didn't have a lot of money, so I went onto eBay to get a pre-owned [phone],\" says Senko.He saw one on eBay listed for $75, and then spotted the same model of phone on Craigslist for $35. It was a \"lightbulb moment\" that seemed too good to be true, he says: \"I would double the money. I would get a phone for free, and then I would get my original $35 back.\"Senko bought the Craigslist phone and sold it on eBay for $70, he says. He used the profits to buy another phone on Craigslist, which he flipped on eBay to double his money again. \"I've been doing that ever since, for almost 20 years. Rinse and repeat,\" says Senko, adding: \"You don't need a lot of money to start. You don't need a lot of knowledge to start. You just need to start.\"He initially focused on electronics — from phones to video games, broken or functional, any low-priced item that he could resell within days, he says. As he learned more about which items sold better than others — and where to find in-demand stock — his earnings grew considerably, topping $100,000 in 2010, he says.Around that time, he began shifting his focus to pre-owned clothing, which requires far less \"customer support,\" he says. \"A T-shirt is not going to break in the mail.\" Clothing required a level of research that Senko was willing to do, he notes: While most people understand that electronics can be valuable, \"not everybody knows a particular Polo Ralph Lauren shirt could be worth more [than a gaming console] ... Oftentimes those [clothes] are discarded in a pile on the floor at the flea market.\"Senko started leaving home before dawn and spending most of each day picking through piles of used clothing at South Florida thrift shops, consignment shops, flea markets and garage sales, he says. Reselling gave him freedom and control over his schedule, and tapped into his competitive desire to win at all costs, he adds.'I get after it every single day'Over time, Senko built relationships with sellers at flea markets and thrift stores to ensure he got the first crack at picking through new stock. He listed and sold roughly 250 items per day, or tens of thousands of products each year, and hired up to five contract employees at a time to help him photograph items, list them online and handle shipping.In 2023, he brought in more than $2.5 million in eBay sales, documents show — up from $500,000 in 2017. But he had a feeling that he'd hit a ceiling of how many items he could list and sell per day, he says.So, that same year, Senko decided to switch up his business model. Rather than buying select pieces and selling them each individually online, he began buying clothes in bulk and selling them wholesale to other resellers willing to spend time carefully sifting through each batch. Clients sometimes buy up to 1,000 items per week, he says.\"They process it, they fulfill it and they sell it one at a time on eBay,\" Senko explains, adding: \"The most valuable asset for my business became the inventory. I'm more profitable selling more items at a smaller margin.\"The lesser time commitment also helped Senko fulfill a promise to his wife, who he met during his brief time at Circuit City, he says: that they'd work as hard as they could until his son graduated high school, and then pursue an early retirement. \"[We wanted to] be able to take a 50-year vacation,\" says Senko.He and his wife finally took time off last year to travel the country, visiting places like New York, California and Las Vegas. \"We are starting to enjoy the fruits of the labor,\" he says. But he's reluctant to actually retire, he notes: \"To say that I am mentally on the 50-year vacation? Not even close.\"Senko says it's difficult for him to shut off his competitive drive, especially when he knows there is money to be made and that he has the means and expertise to do it. And if he keeps working on Technsports, he could try to ensure that his current level of financial stability lasts for the rest of his life, he says.\"I get after it every single day. Because when you unlock [that] ability to multiply money, to take $5, put it onto eBay and sell something and get $25 back, how in the world can you rest?\" he says. \"Did I work a lot? Absolutely ... I needed to grow the business. And, ultimately, I needed to be the best.\"Want to level up your AI skills? Sign up for Smarter by CNBC Make It's new online course, How To Use AI To Communicate Better At Work.

    "body": "There are nearly 4 million health and personal care aides in the U.S.In fact, health and personal care aides were the most common job Americans held as of May 2024, earning an annual median salary of $34,000, according to a CNBC Make It analysis of the latest data available from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.Other common occupations held by Americans include retail salespeople, registered nurses, customer service representatives and fast food and counter workers, though the results vary slightly by geography.The most popular job in Chicago, the third-largest U.S. city by population, involves manual labor. Workers who move freight, stock, luggage or perform general labor tasks have an annual median wage of $40,030 in the Windy City. In Los Angeles, manual freight and stock movers are paid a median annual salary of $39,200, and in Phoenix they bring in a marginally higher annual median salary of $39,630.Of the five most common jobs in America's most populous cities, registered nurses and general and operations managers bring in the highest salaries. In New York, annual median salaries for both occupations are over six figures.Here are the five most common jobs in the metro areas of the five most populous cities in the U.S. — and how much they pay.New York1.

    "body": "Don't feel guilty if you can't make it to your kids' after-school sports practices, says two-time Olympic gold medalist Abby Wambach.Leaving your kids with their teammates and coaches — without your supervision — can make them more resilient, conscientious and internally motivated athletes, the former U.S. Women's National Team soccer star said in an Oct. 21 interview on NBC's \"TODAY Show.\" All of those traits can help them grow up to become successful adults, parenting experts say.\"Drop your kids off ... Sit in your car, play on your phone, do whatever you want to do, read a book, go for a walk, but do not go to the practice,\" said Wambach, a member of the National Soccer Hall of Fame who now has three step-children of her own. \"This is a time for your kids to play, to not be looking over their shoulders [to see if a parent is watching].\"If a child looks over and sees their parent looking at them on the sideline, it could \"outsource their motivation\" and make them either nervous or overly driven to impress, Wambach said in a Sept. 23 episode of her \"Welcome to the Party\" podcast.Nothing should \"encumber them from trying something new, taking a risk, making a mistake, trying something, being successful,\" said Wambach, adding: \"We want our kids to be self-starters and internally motivated.\"DON'T MISS: The ultimate guide to using AI to communicate betterInternally motivated children are more likely to become adults who always strive to do their best, no matter who's watching. Encouraging kids to develop a sense of agency can similarly help them become self-motivated and successful adults, neuropsychologist William Stixrud said in a March 28 episode of the \"Raising Good Humans\" podcast. ″[Your] mission is not to make sure that they turn out a certain way or that they always do well, [but] to help them figure out who they want to be, what kind of life they want and how to create the life that they want,\" said Stixrud. \"So that they can ultimately run their own life before they leave home.\"When you do go to your kids' sports games, don't give them pointers on how to run faster or kick harder, Wambach recommended on her podcast. Instead, \"deemphasize the outcomes of winning or losing and overemphasize the acts of leadership\" by pointing out when they or other players are good teammates.Ask your child, \"What did you see out there today that was a special win that had nothing to do with the score line?\" Wambach said. \"Did you see your teammate cheering? Did you pick up the cones for your coach without being asked?\"Disclosure: NBC and CNBC are divisions of NBCUniversal.Want to level up your AI skills? Sign up for Smarter by CNBC Make It's new online course, How To Use AI To Communicate Better At Work.

    "body": "One in seven people have never spoken to their relatives about their family's health history, according to a recent global study from Bupa, a health insurance company. The survey polled 8,000 adults and 169 health professionals from the UK, Australia, Spain and more.Of the respondents, 30% said having a conversation about family health history had never crossed their minds and 20% said their families don't talk about health openly. \"Even though it's one in seven people, that person is connected to a family who hasn't had those conversations. So in some ways, it's kind of like one in seven families,\" says Sherry Pagoto, a licensed clinical psychologist who was involved in the study.About four in five (79%) of healthcare professionals polled agree that \"more lives could be saved if patients had better knowledge of their family health history,\" according to the study.With the knowledge of genetic health risks, doctors can make informed decisions like screening patients for specific conditions that run in their family, Pagoto says. But patients may not understand the importance of having those conversations or they may be uncomfortable to learn about their health histories, she adds.Another issue is \"not really knowing how to bring it up,\" says Pagoto who is also a professor in the department of Allied Health Sciences at the University of Connecticut. Some people may struggle with how to approach the topic and what to do with the information once they have it.Here are Pagoto's tips for starting the conversation about your genetic health risks with your family, and what she suggests for next steps.6 tips for talking to your family about genetic health risksBelieve that loved ones may be open to the conversation: \"People would be surprised at how open they may find family members to be of talking about themselves,\" Pagoto says. \"Particularly elderly family members.\"Check in with them about how they're currently feeling: Start with what's comfortable by asking, \"How are you feeling today?\" she suggests. You can ask about their most recent check-ups and what they discussed with their doctor.Introduce the topic of your family's health history: You can start the conversation with something like, \"I'd love to know more about any health conditions that you've had because those could run in the family,\" she suggests. Or you can ask what caused the death of specific family members to get more context.Take notes and document the information after: Approach this conversation \"almost like you're constructing this family tree, but of health conditions,\" Pagoto says. Having all of the information in one place makes it easy for you to share it with your doctor or with your siblings or your own children.Get other family members on board: If you speak to your maternal grandmother about that side of your family, maybe you can ask your siblings to speak to your paternal side, she notes. Delegating tasks will make it easier for you to get the knowledge you all need.Share what you learn with the right people: Once you know about your genetic health risks, it's important to share what you've learned with your doctor and your family members. Ask your doctor questions like \"Are there any tests or screenings that we should do for me right now?\" or \"What recommendations do you have for [prevention]?\"Remember that what you learn about your family's health history is only context, and not a prediction of what you can expect in your own future, Pagoto says. \"Your genes are not your fate. They're one part of an equation. Your lifestyle and your health care is a big part of that equation,\" she explains.\"It might actually make you feel more motivated to do these healthy lifestyle behaviors that we sometimes feel like 'I'm not motivated for that' or 'I don't have time for that'. It really pops it up on the top of your priority list.\"Want to level up your AI skills? Sign up for Smarter by CNBC Make It's new online course, How To Use AI To Communicate Better At Work.

    "body": "Saying \"no\" is essential in parenting. But setting limits shouldn't start and end with that one word.As a certified child life specialist and licensed therapist, I know that saying \"no\" is meant to help kids feel safe, supported, and understood. I often help kids understand: \"Your parents aren't saying 'no' to control you, they're saying 'no' to support you.\"Boundaries deepen trust and cooperation over time. When we say \"no\" with calm, consistency, and care, we're setting limits. But we're also teaching emotion regulation, self-control, and connection. These are crucial skills our kids will carry far beyond childhood. Here's how to say no in ways that build connection instead of conflict. Turn 'no' into a teachable momentThink about a curious one-year-old who's putting sand in their mouth, pulling the dog's tail, or standing on a chair. If we just say \"no\" or \"stop\" without explaining, we might leave them feeling confusion, shame, or doubt.Instead we might say \"not in the mouth,\" \"gentle hands,\" or \"sit down.\" It's still a boundary but it teaches and guides them in a way they can learn and understand. When kids aren't adhering to limits, they might need firmer boundaries. But those can still help them figure out what to do, rather than just what not to do. For example: \"No helmet, no bike.\" \"It's not safe to ride without a helmet, so I'm going to put the bike away for now.\" \"As soon as you put your helmet on, you can ride your bike.\"Explain the 'why'Kids crave reasoning to make sense of things. Limits work best when kids understand them. With my two young children, I always lead with limits related to safety and kindness. This helps me stay mindful of when and why I'm saying \"no\" in the first place, and whether or not certain limits are negotiable. Recently, my five-year-old asked for emotional support while I was driving. I said, \"I can't hold your hand when I'm driving because it's not safe. But as soon as we get home, I can give you a hug.\" It was still a \"no,\" but it prioritized connection and safety. When kids know why, they're more likely to accept the limit even if they don't like it. This can teach them perspective-taking. For screens, helmets, and more, it might also mean explaining that \"every family has different rules, and these are ours.\" Offer control through choicesWhen kids hear the word \"no,\" they immediately feel stripped of autonomy and control — often when they're trying to explore their world and build their identity.Pair limits with choices. That can sound like:\"The park isn't a choice right now, you can choose to play in the backyard or in the basement.\"\"Choose one more thing to do and then it's time to leave.\"When kids struggle to decide, you can always resort to: \"You can choose or I can choose for you.\"Kids will feel empowered by being able to make a choice within the boundaries you've clearly set. Be consistent Toddlers test every limit, every day. And it doesn't stop after toddlerhood. It's a sign of healthy development, and it looks different at different ages and stages.This is how kids learn what's safe and where the boundaries are. When limits change easily, kids push harder. When limits are consistent, they learn to trust and expect them.Our job as parents is to communicate consistently, calmly, and clearly even when kids melt down or fight back. It teaches them that their world is safe and predictable, even when it's upsetting, and shows them unwavering support in the face of challenges.Repair when you react Sometimes we shout \"no!\" instinctively in moments of stress or fear, like when a child is running toward the street.It's natural to react that way, but it's essential to follow up with an explanation and perhaps even an apology. When my daughter recently tugged on a necklace that's already broken twice, I added: \"I'm worried it will break. It's special to me and costs money to fix.\" She said, \"I'm sorry mama. It was an accident. I won't do it again.\"Repairing and explaining after an emotional \"no\" can teach kids about accountability and empathy in a relationship and demonstrate reflection and correction.Stay firm as they get olderAs kids grow and develop, boundaries may look and sound different but the underlying message is the same.A \"no\" to going to the park after school might sound like, \"I hear you, but that's not an option today. We already have plans.\" Similarly, when it's time to end an activity: \"We're all done now\" or \"It's time to go home.\" You can even validate their feelings while staying firm: \"It's okay to be upset, but it's not going to change the plans. I'm right here with you.\"These honest conversations around limits teach kids that boundaries and connection can exist together — a lesson that will serve them through every stage of life. Kelsey Mora is Certified Child Life Specialist and Licensed Clinical Professional Counselor who provides custom support, guidance, and resources to parents, families, and communities impacted by medical conditions, trauma, grief, and everyday life stress.

    "body": "Company: Fluor Corp (FLR)Business: Fluor is a holding company that provides engineering, procurement, construction, fabrication and modularization, and project management services. The company's segments include energy solutions, urban solutions and mission solutions. The energy solutions segment provides EPC services for traditional oil and gas markets, including the production and fuels, chemicals, LNG and power markets. The segment serves these industries with comprehensive project life-cycle services. The urban solutions segment provides EPC and project management services to the advanced technologies and manufacturing, life sciences, mining and metals, infrastructure industries and professional staffing services. The mission solutions segment provides high-end technical solutions to the United States and other governments. These include, among others, the Department of Energy, the Department of Defense, the Federal Emergency Management Agency and intelligence agencies. The segment also provides services to commercial nuclear clients.Stock Market Value: $7.89 billion ($48.79 per share)Activist: Starboard ValueOwnership: Starboard ValueAverage Cost: n/aActivist Commentary: Starboard is a very successful activist investor and has extensive experience helping companies focus on operational efficiency and margin improvement. They are known for their excellent diligence and for running many of the most successful campaigns. Starboard has initiated activist campaigns at 18 prior industrial companies and their average return on these situations is 50.55% versus an average of 11.73% for the Russell 2000 during the same time periods. Starboard has taken a total of 162 prior activist campaigns in their history and has an average return of 21.13% versus 14.24% for the Russell 2000 over the same period.What's happeningOn Oct. 21, Starboard announced a nearly 5% position in Fluor and stated their intention to unlock value from the company's ~39% holding in NuScale Power, which represents more than 60% of the company's market capitalization, including through a potential separation.Behind the scenesFluor delivers integrated engineering, procurement, construction, and project management services, spanning a diversified set of end markets. Historically, the EPCM market was a highly competitive landscape that led to heavy risk taking, where growth was often prioritized over discipline and profitability. For Fluor, as well as much of the industry, this led to management aggressively increasing their backlog of higher-risk lump-sum and guaranteed minimum contracts, leading to execution risks, thin margins and cost overruns. Ultimately, this industry-wide shift caused many companies to scale back their construction efforts or even enter bankruptcy, and Fluor was no exception, with the company's share price falling below $4 in March 2020.However, this started to change when the company appointed David Constable as CEO at the start of 2021. Under his leadership, Fluor immediately pivoted to lower-risk reimbursable projects, growing from 45% of its backlog to 80%, while exposure to loss-making legacy projects have declined from $1.8 billion to $558 million today, materially reducing its risk profile. Additionally, while largely associated with legacy energy projects, the company has levered into faster growing markets within its urban solutions segment, now 73% of its backlog compared to 37% in fiscal year 2021. As a result, even with this derisking effort, Fluor was still able to maintain a steady backlog and achieve meaningful EBITDA growth, a 14% compound annual growth rate from fiscal year 2021 to fiscal 2024, with analysts projecting a ~9% CAGR from fiscal 2024 to fiscal 2028. With many of the large construction and EPCM players having exited the market, Fluor's operational turnaround has allowed it to come out the other side of this turmoil on top, now operating in a duopoly of global end-to-end EPCM players with Bechtel, while the construction market has grown rapidly, now over $918 billion. As a result of this successful operational overhaul, the market currently values Fluor at 8.9 time its enterprise value to calendar year 2027 estimates for consensus EBITDA, in between its EPCM (13x) and legacy construction peers (6x). So, Fluor appears to be a great business with a great management team operating in a duopoly in a growing industry that is fairly valued with a $6.7 billion enterprise value. However, Fluor also owns a 39% stake in NuScale, a publicly traded small modular nuclear reactor company. Fluor invested in NuScale more than a decade ago, and its $30 million early investment played a pivotal in NuScale becoming the first U.S.-listed SMR company, and the only company of its kind with U.S. Nuclear Reactor Commission design approval. As global power demand continues to rise, particularly alongside the data center boom, nuclear generation will be vital, and SMRs will play an essential role in providing energy to meet this growth. As a result, Fluor's investment in NuScale has been highly lucrative – valued at approximately $4.3 billion ($3.4 billion post tax). That's more than half Fluor's current enterprise value. If you were to back out the NuScale stake from Fluor's valuation, then Fluor's enterprise value would drop to $3.3 billion, implying an extremely depressed discount of just 4.6x, with peers trading from 6 to 13 times. Starboard has amassed a nearly 5% position in Fluor and is urging management to unlock the value from its NuScale holdings. Starboard believes that Fluor has multiple paths to monetize its remaining NuScale stake. These options include simply selling their position through open-market sales, an exchange offer or a mandatory exchangeable bond, with proceeds potentially funding a large share buyback, which would be highly accretive to Fluor's EPS, especially at its currently depressed valuation. Alternatively, Starboard has proposed a tax-free spinoff of Fluor's NuScale position, which could trigger a similar rerating of the core business while providing Fluor shareholders with the option to retain their exposure to NuScale's long-term potential. Thus, assuming Fluor maintains an 8.9x EBITDA multiple, which still could be improved upon given its discount to EPCM peers, the rerating that could come from this separation could yield over 200% of upside. Starboard is a very experienced activist and also has a history in this industry. In June 2019, Starboard engaged another construction player, AECOM, where over the ensuing multiyear engagement, AECOM refreshed its board, appointed a new CEO, exited self-perform construction, and divested management services. This became one of Starboard's most lucrative engagements in its history, returning 147% over its 13D filling versus 26% for the Russell 2000. But more importantly, this is when they met David Constable for the first time. Constable is the executive chairman of Fluor, and until February, was its CEO. So, we expect that the mutual respect between Starboard and Constable will be conducive to an amicable, constructive relationship and beneficial to shareholders.Ken Squire is the founder and president of 13D Monitor, an institutional research service on shareholder activism, and the founder and portfolio manager of the 13D Activist Fund, a mutual fund that invests in a portfolio of activist investments.",

    "body": "Signage for Novartis AG at a building in the company's headquarters campus in Basel, Switzerland, on Monday, Jan. 8, 2023. Bloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesSwiss pharmaceutical giant Novartis has agreed to buy biotechnology company Avidity Biosciences for about $12 billion, the company said Sunday.Novartis will pay Avidity shareholders $72 a share in cash, a premium of 46% to the company's Friday closing price.The deal is expected to close in the first half of 2026, after Avidity spins out parts of its business, including its early-stage precision cardiology programs, the company said in a statement. \"The Avidity team has built robust programs with industry-leading delivery of RNA therapeutics to muscle tissue,\" Novartis CEO Vas Narasimhan said in the statement. \"We look forward to developing these programs to meaningfully change the trajectory of diseases for patients.\"Novartis has raised the forecast for its sales compound annual growth rate between 2024 and 2029 to 6% from 5% as a result of the acquisition.Bloomberg News first reported the companies were nearing a deal, citing a person familiar with the matter. Novartis and Avidity didn't immediately respond to CNBC's requests for comment.Avidity specializes in developing an innovative class of ribonucleic acid (RNA) therapeutics called antibody oligonucleotide conjugates. RNA-based therapeutics are a relatively new class of medications that work by altering how genes are expressed to treat or prevent diseases.The Avidity deal comes as Novartis ramps up its research and development division. The company earlier this year pledged to invest $23 billion to build out its U.S.-based infrastructure, which includes plans to construct a second R&D hub in San Diego.The pharmaceutical giant has also struck two key deals with Anthos Therapeutics and Regulus Therapeutics this year to boost its development and manufacturing of cardiovascular and kidney disease drugs.Avidity shares closed at $49.15 on Friday. The stock, which has a market capitalization of roughly $7.2 billion, is up nearly 70% since the beginning of the year. Novartis shares closed at $130.36 on Friday.",

    "body": "Timothy Mellon, seen outside an inspection train during a property tour in 1981. Exact date and location unknown.AP PhotoThe mystery donor whose $130 million contribution is meant to pay U.S. military troops during the government shutdown is Timothy Mellon, an heir to a renowned Gilded Age banking family, The New York Times reported Saturday.But Mellon's donation works out to only about $100 per service member. It costs nearly $6.4 billion to pay U.S. troops every two weeks.And using his money might run afoul of federal law, according to the Times, which cited two people familiar with the matter in identifying the billionaire railroad magnate as the donor.When President Donald Trump announced the donation at the White House on Thursday, he did not identify the man by name, but described him as a \"great patriot\" and a \"friend of mine.\"\"And he's a big supporter of mine,\" Trump told reporters on Friday night. \"He's a wonderful man, and he doesn't want publicity.\"Mellon has an estimated net worth close to $1 billion, according to Forbes.But in an email to the news outlet in 2024, Mellon wrote, \"Billionaire NOT! ...

Chris Coons told NBC News that the Delaware Democrat is concerned about allowing anonymous donors to fund government spending.\"Using anonymous donations to fund our military raises troubling questions of whether our own troops are at risk of literally being bought and paid for by foreign powers,\" the spokesman said.Read the complete Times report here.",

    "body": "The stock market has been volatile lately as investors study the latest twists and turns in the the U.S.-China trade war as well as earnings of major American companies. Despite those challenges, investors can also choose to focus on stocks of companies that can navigate short-term pressures to deliver strong, long-term returns.Tracking top Wall Street analysts can help investors pick some attractive stocks, as the recommendations of these experts are based on in-depth analysis of a company's business fundamentals, opportunities and challenges.Here are three stocks favored by the Street's top pros, according to TipRanks, a platform that ranks analysts based on their past performance.PinterestThis first stock pick is social media company Pinterest (PINS), scheduled to announce third-quarter results on November 4. Heading into those numbers, TD Cowen analyst John Blackledge reiterated a buy rating on Pinterest and a $44 price target. TipRanks' AI Analyst is also bullish on Pinterest, giving it an \"outperform\" rating and a price target of $40.Blackledge expects Pinterest Q3 revenue grew by 16.6% versus the year-earlier quarter, in line with the Street's consensus estimate and toward the high end of the company's own guidance. \"We expect EBITDA growth of 20% y/y, outpacing rev growth, driven by modest [cost of revenue] and R&D leverage,\" said Blackledge.  The 5-star analyst remains confident about his mid-teens, year-over-year revenue growth estimate through the second half of 2025 and 2026, partly supported by continued adoption by advertisers of PINS' Performance+ campaign tools.Following a digital ad check call with an agency that runs more than $4 billion annually in managed advertising spending, Blackledge noted that ad spend on Pinterest rose 63% year-over-year in Q3 2025, a slight slowdown compared to 66% in the prior quarter. A TD Cowen expert noted that solid uptake continues in PINS' Performance+ campaign types.In fact, some advertisers have shifted all their Pinterest spending to Performance+. Blackledge said Performance+, rolled out in late 2024 with automated creative tools, has expanded to include automated bidding tools and other artificial intelligence (AI)-driven automated features.Blackledge ranks No. 522 among more than 10,000 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been successful 56% of the time, delivering an average return of 12.5%. See Pinterest Statistics on TipRanks.Uber TechnologiesNext up is ride-sharing and delivery platform Uber Technologies (UBER). Recently, Evercore analyst Mark Mahaney reiterated a buy rating on UBER along with a 12-month price forecast of $150 after hosting a quarterly webinar with Harry Campbell, founder of The Rideshare Guy and The Driverless Digest Dude, where they discussed the latest trends across rideshare, delivery and autonomous vehicle (AV) ecosystems. Like Mahaney, TipRanks' AI Analyst is also bullish on UBER stock, with an \"outperform\" rating and a price target of $108.Campbell was constructive about rideshare supply dynamics, given solid and stable driver economics, Mahaney noted. Campbell continues to see consistent demand and strong driver supply, particularly at Uber, which he described as operating near \"all-time highs.\" Despite robust supply, pricing continues to be high, reflecting sustained demand elasticity and limited alternatives for consumers, particularly for airport and nightlife rides. The top-rated analyst also highlighted Campbell's commentary about early-stage shifts in AV partnerships — particularly Alphabet's Waymo's evolving first-party vs third-party strategy and Uber's expanding AV integration roadmap.Mahaney further noted stable driver economics and widening platform margins. Notably, Uber's \"decoupling\" of rider fares and driver payouts is driving incremental profit margin expansion, even with steady driver income.Through incremental feature innovation, Uber is focused on enhancing ecosystem \"stickiness.\" Uber's recent \"Only on Uber\" event rolled out small feature updates, including tip guarantees and safety enhancements. While not transformative, Mahaney said Campbell sees these efforts as part of Uber's \"broader push to create alternative income channels for drivers as AVs grow share over time.\"Mahaney ranks No. 473 among more than 10,000 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been profitable 57% of the time, delivering an average return of 13%. See Uber Technologies Financials on TipRanks.General MotorsGeneral Motors (GM) jumped 15% on Tuesday after the Cadillac and Buick parent beat the Street's revenue and earnings expectations despite a slight decline in sales. GM also raised its forward guidance, citing a lower-than-expected tariff impact.  Following the Q3 results, Mizuho analyst Vijay Rakesh reiterated a buy rating on GM and raised his price target to $76 from $67. By comparison, TipRanks' AI analyst has a price target of $66 and an \"outperform\" rating on GM.\"We remain positive with reduced tariff burden/risk, improved profitability and [internal combustion engine] SUV/pickup onshoring tailwinds through C26E+,\" said Rakesh.The 5-star analyst noted that GM raised its 2025 guidance for earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT), earnings per share (EPS) and adjusted free cash flow, driven by a smaller-than-expected impact from  tariffs, and said GM is rolling back some of its electric vehicle (EV) plans to boost profitability. That involves GM's sale of its Michigan EV battery plant stake to LG Energy, while keeping two battery plants, and transitioning its Orion plant to gas engine production from an EV focus by 2027.Rakesh believes that smaller EV losses, tariff challenges and warranty costs, and a higher combustion engine mix, will support GM's target to return to 8% to 10% EBIT margin in the North America business. Other tailwinds include $5 billion in deferred revenue from OnStar and Super Cruise models, with about 70% gross margins, combined with a stable average selling prices.Rakesh ranks No. 67 among more than 10,000 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been successful 64% of the time, delivering an average return of 24.8%. See General Motors Insider Trading Activity on TipRanks.",

Salwan Georges | The Washington Post | Getty ImagesBig Tech and other publicly traded companies are helping to finance the $300 million White House ballroom planned by President Donald Trump.The White House East Wing has been demolished to make room for the 90,000 square foot ballroom, sparking public anger after Trump promised in July that the building would not be impacted.Trump has said the construction of the ballroom will be financed by his own funds and corporate and individual donors at no cost to the taxpayer. The president said Wednesday the project will cost $300 million, up from an initial estimate of $200 million.Trump has not said how much he is spending. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters on Thursday that the president will disclose his contribution.The White House has released a list of donors that include Amazon, Alphabet, Apple, Microsoft and Meta.Alphabet is contributing $22 million which represents about 7% of the project's estimated cost. Its contribution is the result of a settlement reached with Trump last month over a lawsuit he filed against YouTube for banning him from the platform after a riot by his supporters against Congress on Jan. 6, 2021.The settlement notes that $22 million will be contributed on Trump's behalf \"to the Trust for the National Mall, a 501(c)(3) tax-exempt entity dedicated to restoring, preserving, and elevating the National Mall, to support the construction of the White House State Ballroom.\"Donors also include Palantir, Micron, Coinbase, Lockheed Martin, Continental Resources founder Harold Hamm, and Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, according to the White House list.\"Lockheed Martin is grateful for the opportunity to help bring the President's vision to reality and make this addition to the People's House, a powerful symbol of the American ideals we work to defend every day,\" a company spokesperson said in a statement.Comcast, CNBC's current parent company, is also on the donor list.

    "body": "Canada's Prime Minister Mark Carney waves next to U.S. President Donald Trump at the White House in Washington, D.C., U.S., Oct. 7, 2025. Evelyn Hockstein | ReutersPresident Donald Trump on Saturday said he was slapping an extra 10% tariff on imports from Canada in retaliation for what he says is a misleading TV ad featuring former President Ronald Reagan criticizing tariffs.\"Canada was caught, red handed, putting up a fraudulent advertisement in Ronald Reagan's Speech on Tariffs,\" Trump wrote in a post on Truth Social.\"Because of their serious misrepresentation of the facts, and hostile act, I am increasing the Tariff on Canada by 10% over and above what they are paying now,\" he wrote.Canada generally pays a 35% tariff on goods sold in the U.S., with exceptions for certain products covered under the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, and other specific product exceptions, such as steel and aluminum, which are tariffed at 50%.Trump late Friday blasted the Ontario provincial government in Canada for waiting until after the first two games of the World Series to pause the Reagan ad.\"They could have pulled it tonight,\" Trump told reporters at the White House as he headed to fly to Asia.\"Well, that's dirty play,\" he said. \"But I can play dirtier than they can, you know.\"Trump had cited the ad in his decision on Thursday night to trade negotiations with Canada.Ontario Premier Doug Ford on Friday afternoon said he would pause the ad on Monday so that trade talks could resume.But Ford also said, \"I've directed my team to keep putting our message in front of Americans over the weekend so that we can air our commercial during the first two World Series games.\"Trump said Friday night that he had heard that Ontario was pulling the ad.But he also said he did not know the government was leaving it on until Monday.The ad was shown Friday night during a broadcast to millions of Americans of the first game of the World Series.That game was won 11-4 by Canada's Toronto Blue Jays over the U.S.'s Los Angeles Dodgers.Toronto is in Ontario, and is the hometown of Ford.Ford, in a tweet earlier Friday announcing the ad pause, said, \"Our intention was always to initiate a conversation about the kind of economy that Americans want to build and the impact of tariffs on workers and businesses.\"We've achieved our goal, having reached U.S. audiences at the highest levels,\" Ford said, apparently referring to Trump.\"In speaking with Prime Minister [Mark] Carney, Ontario will pause its U.S. advertising campaign effective Monday so that trade talks can resume,\" he said.Read more CNBC politics coverageTrump pardons convicted Binance founder Changpeng ZhaoChauncey Billups, others arrested in FBI probe linking NBA to Mafia gambling ringTrump to demolish entire East Wing of White House for ballroom: 'Plans changed'Government shutdown becomes 2nd longest in U.S. historyTrump special counsel nominee Paul Ingrassia withdraws after racist texts flapTrump says U.S. cattle ranchers 'don't understand' tariffs, must lower pricesOil jumps 3% after Trump administration sanctions big Russian oil companiesRussia was smug about Trump-Putin talks.

But the ad accurately captures Reagan saying, \"Over the long run, such trade barriers hurt every American worker and consumer.\"The ad also has Reagan, from the same speech, saying, \"When someone says, 'Let's impose tariffs on foreign imports,' it looks like they're doing the patriotic thing by protecting American products and jobs. And sometimes, for a short while, it works — but only for a short time.\"\"High tariffs inevitably lead to retaliation by foreign countries and the triggering of fierce trade wars,\" Reagan said in the speech and in the ad.Ford, who calls himself a \"big Ronald Reagan fan,\" first posted the ad on X on Oct. 16, days after saying that Ontario's government would spend $75 million to run the ad in the United States.\"We're going to repeat that message to every Republican district there is, right across the entire country,\" said Ford.Trump raged about the ad in a Truth Social post on Friday morning.\"CANADA CHEATED AND GOT CAUGHT!!! They fraudulently took a big buy ad saying that Ronald Reagan did not like Tariffs, when actually he LOVED TARIFFS FOR OUR COUNTRY, AND ITS NATIONAL SECURITY,\" Trump wrote.\"Canada is trying to illegally influence the United States Supreme Court in one of the most important rulings in the history of our Country. Canada has long cheated on Tariffs, charging our farmers as much as 400%. Now they, and other countries, can't take advantage of the U.S. any longer. Thank you to the Ronald Reagan Foundation for exposing this FRAUD.\"The Supreme Court in early November is set to hear oral arguments in a case that will determine if Trump had power under the law to impose sweeping tariffs against scores of countries, including Canada, without the consent of Congress.",

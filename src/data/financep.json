    "body": "Shoppers and visitors on London's Oxford Street brave the bad weather using Union Flag umbrellas on 6th May 2024.Mike Kemp | In Pictures | Getty ImagesThe U.K. economy grew a meager 0.1% in the third quarter, according to preliminary figures from the Office for National Statistics, marking one of the last major pieces of economic data to be released ahead of the Autumn Budget.Economists polled by Reuters expected the economy to have grown 0.2% over the July-September period, following an expansion of 0.3% in the second quarter.Month-on-month, the economy shrank by 0.1% in September, following no growth in August (which was revised down from a 0.1% expansion in the ONS' previous data).\"Growth slowed further in the third quarter of the year with both services and construction weaker than in the previous period. There was also a further contraction in production,\" Liz McKeown, director of Economic Statistics at the ONS, said on Thursday.Across the quarter as a whole manufacturing drove the weakness in production, the ONS said, highlighting the cyber attack on Jaguar Land Rover, which halted production for five weeks, as a major source of economic disruption.\"There was a particularly marked fall in car production in September, reflecting the impact of a cyber incident, as well as a decline in the often-erratic pharmaceutical industry,\" McKeown said in comments posted on social media platform X.Budget boost, or blow?The data comes ahead of the British government's highly anticipated Autumn Budget on Nov. 26, at which Finance Minister Rachel Reeves is expected to announce fresh tax hikes in order to fill a fiscal black hole.There are concerns that tax hikes could put a dampener on consumer spending and economic activity, but the economy could get a pre-Christmas boost if the Bank of England cuts interest rates at its last meeting of the year on Dec. 18.Responding to the latest growth data, Reeves said: \"At my Budget later this month, I will take the fair decisions to build a strong economy that helps us to continue to cut waiting lists, cut the national debt and cut the cost of living.\"Rachel Reeves, U.K. chancellor of the exchequer, delivers a speech in London, UK, on Tuesday, Nov. 4, 2025. Bloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty Images\"All eyes will now be on the upcoming Budget with another weak GDP reading only adding to debates around which levers the Chancellor can pull to stimulate growth,\" Scott Gardner, investment strategist at JPMorgan Personal Investing, said in emailed analysis.\"In our view, boosting housing market activity is key to unlocking decent, sustained growth ... That said, with tax rises all but confirmed, consumption and, in turn, services spending could face more headwinds from the second quarter of next year when tax and spend measures could come into place. It remains all to play for,\" he added.Amanda Blanc, chief executive of Aviva, told CNBC's \"Squawk Box Europe\" on Thursday that the budget \"can't come soon enough,\" with businesses and consumers seemingly nervous about what's in store. \"You can deal with certainty, what you can't deal with is speculation,\" she said.Read moreAt its most recent meeting last week, the Bank of England held off trimming rates with BOE Governor Andrew Bailey telling CNBC that he and the bank's monetary policy committee wanted to see another batch of inflation and labor market prints before acting.Rob Wood, chief U.K. economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, was among the economists expecting a Christmas rate cut whether the latest GDP data showed a bounce, or not.\"We believe the MPC [BOE's monetary policy committee) would reduce rates in December even with an upside GDP surprise, as a likely contractionary Budget on November 26 dominates its deliberations,\" Wood said in emailed analysis ahead of the GDP data.\"But growth is proving resilient, running close to the U.K.'s potential of 0.3% quarter-to-quarter despite strong headwinds from fiscal and global uncertainty.\"Wood believed that resilient growth would limit the emergence of spare capacity, making it trickier for the BOE to cut interest rates again in 2026, although some economists predict there could be two rate cuts next year.",

    "body": "White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt speaks during the daily press briefing in the Brady Press Briefing Room at the White House on Nov. 12, 2025 in Washington, DC. Win McNamee | Getty ImagesKey economic reports for October may not be released at all because of the government shutdown, a senior White House official said Wednesday.With the spending impasse appearing to be near an end, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters that part of the fallout could be lasting damage to the government's data collection ability.\"The Democrats may have permanently damaged the Federal Statistical system with October CPI and jobs reports likely never being released,\" Leavitt said. \"All of that economic data released will be permanently impaired, leaving our policymakers at the Fed, flying blind at a critical period.\"Release of important economic data has been at the forefront of Wall Street concerns as the shutdown dragged on for more than six weeks, the longest in history.Among the most important releases are the monthly nonfarm payrolls count and the consumer price index, both of which come from the Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics. Other data impacted includes retail sales, import and export data as well as consumer spending and income.Most Wall Street economists have been expecting all of the data to be released, albeit delayed. However, Leavitt's comments cast doubt on whether that will happen.\"The Democrat shutdown made it extraordinarily difficult for economists, investors and policymakers at the Federal Reserve to receive critical government data,\" Leavitt said.Leavitt added that the shutdown could lower fourth-quarter economic growth by up to 2 percentage points. Earlier in the afternoon, Kevin Hassett, director of the National Economic Council, said the impasse might shave up to 1.5 percentage points from current-quarter GDP.\"For sure, it's going to have an impact on this quarter,\" Hassett said during an appearance at the Economic Club of Washington, D.C.However, most economists expect the impact to be minimal.Goldman Sachs, in fact, raised its estimates for GDP heading into the end of the year. The firm boosted its Q3 outlook slightly to 3.7% and raised its full-year forecast to 1.3%, a change of 0.3 percentage point.On the issue of data collection, Goldman's economists said they expect the shutdown to have \"a limited impact\" on the quality of jobs data.As for timing, Citigroup economists on Wednesday speculated that the September nonfarm payrolls report could be released as early as Friday but more likely in the early part of next week. They said it could take until early December to put together the October count.Jobs report data should be easy to collect belatedly because it involves asking business for hard numbers, according to Jeffrey Roach, chief economist at LPL Financial. In fact, he said the BLS could likely get multiple months' worth of data during one collection period if needed.But he said it's harder to get information from everyday people because it requires asking them about their willingness to work during a period that has already passed.\"It's just the more nuanced qualitative surveys that cannot be replicated,\" Roach said. \"The water has gone under that bridge already.\"Roach said previous shutdowns have mostly only resulted in delays of the release of data that the government had already collected. But he said this closure lasted long enough to also keep agencies closed during what would have been their collection periods for these reports.— CNBC's Alex Harring contributed.",

    "body": "Anthropic announced plans Wednesday to spend $50 billion on a U.S. artificial intelligence infrastructure build-out, starting with custom data centers in Texas and New York.The facilities, which will be designed to support the company's rapid enterprise growth and its long-term research agenda, will be developed in partnership with Fluidstack.Fluidstack is an AI cloud platform that supplies large-scale graphics processing unit, or GPU, clusters to clients like Meta, Midjourney and Mistral.Additional sites are expected to follow, with the first locations going live in 2026. The project is expected to create 800 permanent jobs and more than 2,000 construction roles.The investment positions Anthropic as a major domestic player in physical AI infrastructure at a moment when policymakers are increasingly focused on U.S.-based compute capacity and technological sovereignty.\"We're getting closer to AI that can accelerate scientific discovery and help solve complex problems in ways that weren't possible before. Realizing that potential requires infrastructure that can support continued development at the frontier,\" said CEO Dario Amodei. \"These sites will help us build more capable AI systems that can drive those breakthroughs, while creating American jobs.\"The move comes as Anthropic rival OpenAI pushes forward with an aggressive build-out of its own. The ChatGPT maker has secured more than $1.4 trillion in long-term infrastructure commitments through deals with Nvidia, Broadcom, Oracle and the major cloud providers, including Microsoft, Google, and, most recently, Amazon.The scale of that spending has raised questions about whether the U.S. has the power capacity and industrial backbone to deliver on such promises, and whether the AI sector is drifting into bubble territory.Read more CNBC tech newsAI spending is not all equal.

Internal projections obtained by The Wall Street Journal showed Anthropic expects to break even by 2028, well ahead of OpenAI, which is projecting $74 billion in operating losses that same year.To support that trajectory, Anthropic tapped Fluidstack to build custom facilities optimized for its AI workloads, citing the firm's speed and ability to deliver gigawatts of power on short timelines.In parallel, Amazon has opened a dedicated data center campus for Anthropic on 1,200 acres in Indiana.The $11 billion facility is already up and running, while many competitors are still promising data centers of the future. Anthropic has also expanded its compute deal with Google by tens of billions of dollars.The move also comes as the role of the federal government in financing AI infrastructure becomes a flashpoint.Last week, OpenAI asked the Trump administration to expand a key CHIPS Act tax credit to include AI data centers and grid components like transformers, according to a letter obtained by Bloomberg.That request followed backlash over comments from CFO Sarah Friar, who had floated the idea of a government \"backstop\" for OpenAI's compute deals.Though the company has since walked back the suggestion of federal guarantees, the episode underscored the political and financial uncertainty surrounding how — and by whom — America's AI infrastructure will be funded.WATCH: SoftBank's Nvidia exit fuels OpenAI push despite mounting losses, stiff competition from Anthropicwatch now",

    "body": "U.S. President Donald Trump signs funding legislation to reopen the federal government as he is joined by House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA), House Minority Leader Steve Scalise (R-LA), Republican lawmakers and business leaders, during a ceremony in the Oval Office of the White House on Nov. 12, 2025, in Washington, DC.Win McNamee | Getty ImagesPresident Donald Trump late Wednesday signed into law a funding bill to end the longest federal government shutdown in U.S. history.The measure, which will fund government operations through the end of January, was passed by the House of Representatives earlier Wednesday night in a 222-209 vote.\"The Democrats tried to extort our country,\" Trump said before signing the bill in the Oval Office at the White House to reopen the government after 43 days.Democrats had blocked passage of a funding bill until Sunday, when a bloc of the party's Senate caucus agreed to support a new funding measure in that chamber, despite it not including an extension of Affordable Care Act tax credits.\"Republicans never wanted a shutdown,\" said the president, who was flanked by Republican leaders of Congress.\"People were hurt so badly,\" Trump said, noting the more than 1 million federal workers furloughed, and the effect on government services for Americans. \"We can never let this happen again.\"He reiterated his call for the Senate to end a filibuster rule that effectively requires 60 votes to pass legislation, including short-term funding resolutions.Trump did not take questions from reporters after the signing, despite several of them trying to ask about the release by House Democrats earlier in the day of documents from the estate of his former friend, Jeffrey Epstein, the notorious sex offender. He was asked about, but ignored, a question about emails by Epstein referring to him.Trump has denied knowing about Epstein's sexual abuse of underage girls and young women when they were friends.House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., before Wednesday's vote, in comments backing the bill on the chamber's floor, said, \"My friends, let's get this done.\"Just two Republicans in the House voted against the bill: Thomas Massie of Kentucky and Florida's Greg Steube.All but six Democrats voted against the bill: Adam Gray of California; Maine's Jared Golden; Tom Suozzi of New York; Washington's Marie Gluesenkamp Perez; Don Davis of North Carolina; and Henry Cuellar of Texas.The Office of Management and Budget told federal employees to return to their jobs on Thursday.Earlier Wednesday night, the U.S. Department of Transportation froze the level of flight cuts it imposed in light of shortages of air traffic controllers during the shutdown.As of Tuesday, 6% of scheduled flights were cancelled at U.S. airports, and that level was set to rise to 10% by Friday.The shutdown began on Oct. 1, and government operations had remained shuttered since then because Senate Democrats overwhelmingly refused to vote for a funding measure that did not extend the boosted ACA credits, which reduce the cost of Obamacare health insurance plans for 20 million Americans.The Senate passed the funding bill on Monday night, a day after the Republican majority won support for it from seven Democrats and one independent senator to barely reach the 60-vote minimum.Under the deal, Senate Republicans agreed to allow Democrats a vote in December on a bill of their choice to extend those boosted subsidies, which are due to expire at the end of that month.Without those tax credits, millions of Americans will see sharp increases in the cost of their Obamacare insurance plans.In addition to short-term funding, the deal will also reverse all shutdown-related layoffs of federal government employees and ensure that all federal workers will be paid their normal salaries that they would have received if the government had not shut down.It is not yet known when all federal employees will be paid, but agencies are expected to roughly follow the timeline for paying House staffers, who are set to receive checks on Tuesday.The package also funds the SNAP program, which helps feed 42 million Americans through food stamps. The Trump administration tried to end those food stamp benefits in November, citing the shutdown, and then refused to tap money other than $4.6 billion in a congressionally appropriate contingency fund to fully pay SNAP benefits for the month.The Supreme Court had stayed a federal judge's order mandating that full benefits be paid until Thursday, giving Congress time to effectively moot the case by passing the shutdown bill.The deal also includes provisions for a bipartisan budget process and prevents the White House from using continuing resolutions to fund the government.CRs have been repeatedly used to avoid government shutdowns.Rep. Rosa DeLauro, D-Conn., during remarks on the House floor before the House vote, said some people will see their monthly insurance premiums \"double or even triple\" because of the lack of protection for the added ACA subsidies.In 2026, she said, \"more than 2 million Americans are expected to lose their health plans next year because it is just too expensive.\"DeLauro said that Johnson, the House speaker, \"has shown no interest\" in holding a vote on the ACA subsidies, despite Senate Republicans saying that was the plan.House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, R-La., said, \"We never should have been here.\"\"We tried as Republicans more than a month ago to prevent a government shutdown,\" Scalise said.\"We waited for 42 days where time and time again, Democrats, to appease their most radical base, voted to keep that government shut down.\"Scalise said \"millions of Americans\" have had to endure \"pain and suffering\" because Democrats refused to vote for a funding bill.He accused Democrats of hypocrisy by seeking $200 billion in health spending that would benefit \"illegals,\" while \"advocating to gut the $50 billion Rural Health Care Fund.\"It's insanity,\" Scalise said.",

Allison Joyce | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesToyota Motor on Wednesday said it has started production at a new $13.9 billion battery plant in North Carolina and confirmed plans to invest up to $10 billion more than previously expected over the next five years in the United States.The Japanese automaker did not release details about the increased investment other than Toyota Motor North America CEO Tetsuo Ogawa calling it a \"pivotal moment\" in the company's history along with the new battery plant, according to a release.The facility is Toyota's first in-house battery plant outside of Japan. It was first announced in December 2021 amid the Biden administration's push to onshore production of batteries for hybrids and all-electric vehicles.Since then, market conditions for EVs have soured, while demand for hybrids continues to grow exponentially. Those changes are positive for Toyota, which is the U.S. leader in hybrid sales with a more than 51% market share through the third quarter of this year, according to Motor Intelligence data.It's unclear how much of the investment was already planned but not made previously public, but the announcement follows President Donald Trump last month saying Toyota would invest $10 billion in the U.S.Toyota and the entire automotive industry have been attempting to navigate production plans amid regulatory changes impacting EVs and Trump's litany of tariffs on new vehicles and parts.Toyota's U.S. sales through the third quarter of this year were up 9.9% to more than 1.3 million vehicles sold.",

    "body": "Susan Collins, president and chief executive officer of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, during a Bloomberg Television interview at the Kansas City Federal Reserve's Jackson Hole Economic Policy Symposium in Moran, Wyoming, US, on Friday, Aug. 22, 2025. David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesBoston Federal Reserve President Susan Collins on Wednesday said she will be reluctant to support further interest rate cuts anytime soon with inflation still high and policymakers hampered by a lack of data due to the government shutdown.\"Given my baseline outlook, it will likely be appropriate to keep policy rates at the current level for some time to balance the inflation and employment risks in this highly uncertain environment,\" the central bank official said in remarks delivered in her home district. \"I see several reasons to have a relatively high bar for additional easing in the near term.\"Collins's comments are notable because she is a voting member of the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee. Her remarks put her on the hawkish side of the rate debate, highlighting a fissure among committee members that led Chair Jerome Powell to say in October that a cut at the December meeting is not a foregone conclusion, despite market pricing of a high probability.Collins supported the quarter percentage point rate cut at the October meeting but indicated that further easing could thwart the Fed's efforts to get inflation lower.While Collins said softness in the labor market \"bears watching,\" she added that the risks of inflation staying above the Fed's 2% target warrant caution.\"Against this backdrop, providing additional monetary support to economic activity runs the risk of slowing – or possibly even stalling – the return of inflation to target,\" she said. \"And with resilient demand, the downside risks to employment, while present, do not seem to have increased further since the summer.\"Collins also noted the role that the government shutdown is playing in her decision making. The impasse appears to be over, but White House press secretary said Wednesday that key reports on inflation and employment may not be available at all for October.\"Absent evidence of a notable labor market deterioration, I would be hesitant to ease policy further, especially given the limited information on inflation due to the government shutdown,\" Collins said.The FOMC in October voted 10-2 for the cut. Governor Stephen Miran voted no because he wanted a bigger reduction, while Kansas City Fed President Jeffrey Schmid opposed because he favored no cut.",

    "body": "watch nowAtlanta Federal Reserve President Raphael Bostic said Wednesday he will be leaving his position when his term expires in February.Bostic has been in his current role since June 2017 and is the first Black and openly gay regional president. His term, which also was marked by issues relating to personal investments he made, runs until Feb. 28.\"I'm proud of what we accomplished during my tenure to turn the lofty goal of an economy that works for everyone into more of a reality, and I look forward to discovering new ways to advance that bold vision in my next chapter,\" Bostic said in a statement.The announcement comes ahead of a pivotal year for the Fed and its rate-setting body, the Federal Open Market Committee.Regional presidents serve five-year terms that generally run in sync and are designed to expire on years that end in either 1 or 6, which will be the case next year. While the local boards vote on the presidents, they are subject to approval by the Fed's Board of Governors. Normally a routine process, unusual political dynamics on the board could add a new wrinkle to the procedure.In addition to the reappointments of the regional presidents, Jerome Powell's term as Fed chair expires in May, though his run as governor goes until 2028.Bostic has been seen as more of a centrist during his run, though he's been more cautious about cutting interest rates this year during a time of elevated inflation and a softening labor market. He is not an FOMC voter this year. Atlanta next will get a vote in 2027.Powell said Bostic's \"perspective has enriched the Federal Open Market Committee's understanding of our dynamic economy. And his steady voice has exemplified the best of public service — grounded in analysis, informed by experience, and guided by purpose.\"Until the board names a successor, Cheryl Venable, the first vice president and chief operating officer at the Atlanta Fed, will handle the role of president.Bostic's term has not been without controversy.In October 2022, the Fed announced it was looking at trades Bostic made during blackout periods near policy meetings. An internal report showed there were 154 trades made on his behalf during those times. However, the report also indicated there was no evidence Bostic traded on insider information or had personal conflicts.There also were other issues raised regarding financial disclosure terms and an improper level of Treasury holdings.For his part, Bostic expressed regret over the discrepancies and said the trades were executed by third-party managers over whom he did not have control.The controversy was part of a larger issue with investments from Fed officials that triggered tighter internal controls and rules over what types of securities they are permitted to hold.",

    "body": "A power substation near the LC1 CloudHQ data center in Ashburn, Virginia, on March 27, 2024.Nathan Howard | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesVoter anger at surging electricity prices is fueling political backlash against the artificial intelligence industry's data centers, with Democrats accusing the Trump administration of failing to address the issue as they zero in on affordability ahead of next year's mid-term elections.Abigail Spanberger won last week's governor's race in Virginia, home to the largest concentration of data centers in the world, after promising to make the industry \"pay their own way and their fair share\" of rising electricity costs.New Jersey governor-elect Mikie Sherrill has promised to declare a state of emergency over electric bills on her first day in office and freeze prices in the Garden State. Two Democrats were elected to Georgia's commission that regulates utilities, breaking total Republican control, with one of the candidates arguing that prices are rising in the Peach State in part due to data centers.On the heels of the election victories, Democratic senators in Washington led by Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut and Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont took aim this week at what they described as the White House's \"sweetheart deals with Big Tech companies,\" accusing the administration of failing to protect consumers from \"being forced to subsidize the cost of data centers.\"\"As a result, everyday Americans are already being forced into bidding wars with trillion-dollar companies to keep the lights on at home,\" the senators wrote Monday in a letter demanding solutions from the White House.President Donald Trump promised to cut families' electric bills by 50% in his first year in office. But residential prices in the U.S. increased about an average 6% in August nationwide compared to the same-period in 2024, according to October data from the Energy Information Administration. Prices soared about 21% in New Jersey, 13% in Virginia and about 5% in Georgia in the same period.The reasons for price hikes vary by state and region, said Abraham Silverman, who served as general counsel for New Jersey's public utility board from 2019 until 2023 under outgoing Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy.But data centers are playing the main role in rising bills on the PJM Interconnection electric grid that serves New Jersey and Virginia, Silverman said. PJM is the largest grid in the U.S., reaching more than 65 million people across 13 states in the Mid-Atlantic and parts of the Midwest and South.\"We are basically adding a Philadelphia's worth of new electricity users to the grid every year, starting in 2025 and showing no signs of slowing,\" Silverman said of the national increase in demand. \"Where is that load growth coming from? The answer is data centers.\"Surging pricesThe conditions that led to surging household electricity prices this year, particularly in the PJM region, took root before the second Trump administration entered office, when investment in AI data centers was just starting to ramp up.The amount PJM agreed to pay in late 2022 to secure capacity from power plants, which ensures they are available when electricity use rises, totaled $2.2 billion. In 2024, the bill soared more than 500% to $14.7 billion. This year, it jumped another 9% to $16.1 billion.The independent watchdog that monitors PJM found the main culprit for soaring capacity prices: data centers.\"The current conditions in the capacity market are almost entirely the result of large load additions from data centers, both actual historical and forecast,\" the watchdog Monitoring Analytics concluded in its independent market monitor report published in June.Those capacity prices are ultimately passed down to household electricity bills, Silverman said. \"It is an extremely large component of the affordability crisis we're experiencing right now.\"New Jersey utility PSE&G, owned by Public Service Enterprise Group, acknowledged the impact of exploding capacity prices in a February letter to consumers warning of a 17% increase in their bills, though it didn't call out data centers.\"Utilities do not earn a profit on the electric supply; these costs are passed through directly to customers,\" the company said.The problem could get worse as the data center build out accelerates — at least for now. Power used by data centers in advanced stages of planning in Pennsylvania, for example, jumped more than 40% to 20.5 gigawatts in the third quarter, up from 14.4 gigawatts previously, according to the utility PPL. That's equivalent to the power consumption of about 17 million U.S. homes.\"I want to be clear that these load additions are real, they are coming fast and furious,\" PPL CEO Vincent Sorgi said on its latest earnings call. \"The bottom line is that we need to start building new generation as soon as possible.\"It is unlikely that residential utility bills will come down this decade as demand is expected to remain high and supplies tight, said Rob Gramlich, president of Grid Strategies, a power sector consulting firm.Political blame gameThe Democratic senators accused the Trump administration of making the affordability problem worse with its attacks on renewable energy. Trump has tried to halt the expansion of wind power, particularly offshore wind projects, and his signature piece of domestic legislation, the One Big Beautiful Bill, phases out tax credits for renewable energy.Renewables are the most readily available source of generation to meet new demand, with solar, battery storage and wind making up more than 90% of the projects that are waiting to connect to the grid, according to August data from the consulting firm Enverus. Sherrill and Spanberger campaigned on expanding renewable energy in New Jersey and Virginia not to lower carbon emissions, but to help bring down energy costs.The White House blames the Biden administration and its renewable energy policies for driving up electricity prices. Trump \"declared an energy emergency to reverse four years of Biden's disastrous policies, accelerate large-scale grid infrastructure projects, and expedite the expansion of coal, natural gas and nuclear power generation,\" White House spokeswoman Taylor Rogers said in a statement.The AI industry should pay for the new generation and transmission that is needed to support their data centers, Silverman said. \"If we do that, then we are really going a long way to insulate mom and pop consumers from the higher costs,\" he said.The Data Center Coalition, a lobbying group, said in a statement that \"the industry is committed to paying its full cost of service for the energy it uses.\"",

The stock rose more than 7% in extended trading.Here's how the company did in comparison with consensus estimates from LSEG:Earnings per share: $1 adjusted vs. 98 cents expectedRevenue: $14.88 billion vs. $14.77 billion expectedRevenue increased 8% from $13.84 billion in the same period a year earlier, Cisco said in a statement. Net income climbed to $2.86 billion, or 72 cents per share, from $2.71 billion, or 68 cents per share, a year ago.It's the fourth straight quarter of growth for Cisco following a stretch of four consecutive year-over-year revenue declines, as the company contended with economic uncertainty and delayed spending from government agencies.Cisco's networking business, its biggest unit, saw sales climb 15% to $7.77 billion. Analysts were expecting revenue for that segment of $7.47 billion, according to StreetAccount.Most of the growth in data center spending is focused on artificial intelligence, as companies bolster their investments in servers packed with graphics processing units, primarily from Nvidia. Cisco is trying to tie itself more closely to the AI boom, and last month introduced a new Ethernet switch based on Nvidia silicon.Cisco said that AI infrastructure orders from \"hyperscaler customers\" reached $1.3 billion, \"reflecting a significant acceleration in growth.\"\"Our relevance in AI continues to build,\" CFO Mark Patterson said in the press release. \"We have a multi-year, multi-billion-dollar campus refresh opportunity starting to ramp, with strong demand for our refreshed networking products.\" For the fiscal second quarter, Cisco said it expects revenue of $15 billion to $15.2 billion, topping the $14.6 billion average estimate, according to LSEG. Adjusted earnings will be $1.01 to $1.03 per share, exceeding the 99-cent average estimate.Revenue for the full fiscal year will be between $60.2 billion and $61 billion, with earnings per share of $4.08 to $4.14, Cisco said. Analysts expect sales of $59.7 billion and EPS of $4.04.While networking is growing and performing better than expected, Cisco's other two main segments saw revenue declines and missed Wall Street's expectations.Sales in the company's security unit fell 2% from a year earlier to $1.98 billion, missing the average estimate of $2.16 billion, according to StreetAccount. And collaboration sales slipped 3% to $1.06 billion, trailing the $1.09 billion average estimate.Cisco shares are up 25% this year as of Wednesday's close, topping the 21% gain for the Nasdaq.WATCH: Cisco's product chief on AI agentswatch now",

Michael Nagle | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesFirefly Aerospace's stock surged 15% on Wednesday after the space technology company issued better-than-expected third-quarter results and lifted its guidance.Revenues in the third quarter jumped nearly 38% to $30.8 million from $22.4 million in the year-ago period and nearly doubled from the previous quarter.Firefly's net loss totaled $140.4 million, or $1.50 per share. The company said net loss included costs tied to its IPO, foreign exchange and executive severanceThe company also lifted its outlook for the year, saying it now expects revenues to range between $150 million and $158 million. That's up from previous guidance in the range of $133 million and $145 million.This is Firefly's second quarterly report as a public company. Last quarter, shares slumped after it posted a bigger loss and lower revenues than analysts were expecting. The Cedar Park, Texas, company went public on the Nasdaq in August during a period of heightened enthusiasm toward space technology. The U.S. government and NASA have leaned on more contracts with companies like Firefly and Elon Musk's SpaceX to support moon missions.But shares of Firefly have lost 70% of their value since their opening day close, and the company's market capitalization has plummeted from about $8.5 billion to about $2.7 billion on Wednesday.In September, Firefly shares sank after a rocket exploded during a ground test at the company's Texas facility, days after receiving clearance from the Federal Aviation Administration over a separate incident. Firefly has since put \"corrective measures\" in place, the company said on Wednesday. Shares dropped 35% in September and are down 24% this month.Firefly in July won a nearly $177 million contract with NASA for an upcoming moon mission, and in October, it announced its acquisition of defense tech firm SciTec to boost its national security portfolio.",

    "body": "A protester holds a sign related to the release of the Jeffrey Epstein case files outside the US Capitol in Washington, DC, Nov. 12, 2025. Saul Loeb | AFP | Getty ImagesA petition in the House of Representatives to force a vote to compel the Justice Department to release the so-called Jeffrey Epstein files on Wednesday secured the last signature required to trigger that action.House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., within hours said that a full House vote on that effort will be held next week.Rep. Adelita Grijalva, D-Ariz., provided the 218th signature needed to approve the so-called discharge petition shortly after she was sworn in as a House member, after a seven-week delay. Griljalva won a special election to fill the seat vacated due to the death of her father, Rep. Raúl Grijalva, in March.The Trump administration has been under fire for months for reneging on promises to release investigative files related to Epstein, a convicted sex offender who killed himself in 2019 after his arrest on child sex trafficking charges.Epstein had been a friend of President Donald Trump for years before they had a falling out in the early 2000s.Even if the effort passes in the House, it is unlikely to become law. The bill would have to pass in the Republican-controlled Senate, and Trump could veto it even if it survived a vote in that chamber.The New York Times reported Wednesday that Rep. Lauren Boebert, a Colorado Republican, was summoned to the White House to meet with top Justice Department and FBI officials as Trump tries to head off the House vote, The New York Times reported.Boebert is just one of four GOP House members who signed the discharge petition on the Epstein files. files.Jennifer Freeman, an attorney for Epstein victim Maria Farmer, in a statement to MSNBC, said, \"For decades, survivors of Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell have been left in the dark, the government ignored or cast aside survivor reports of Epstein and Maxwell's crimes, and the vast majority of people who were implicated have yet to be held responsible.\"\"There's no time to waste – we urge lawmakers to do their part and vote on releasing the Epstein files once and for all,\" Freeman said.House Democrats earlier Wednesday released more than 20,000 documents obtained from Epstein's estate under a subpoena.The documents include emails and text messages in which Epstein talked about Trump.\"I know how dirty donald is,\" Epsten wrote in a 2018 email thread for Kathryn Ruemmler, who served as former President Barack Obama's White House counsel, after she sent Epstein an article about Trump's ex-personal lawyer and fixer Michael Cohen's pleading guilty to campaign finance violations and agreeing to cooperate in a federal investigation of the president.In a separate April 2019 email released by Democrats, Epstein told author Michael Wolff that Trump \"knew about the girls.\" It is unclear what the phrase \"knew about the girls\" meant.In another newly released email that Epstein wrote to his now-convicted accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell in April 2011, Epstein wrote, \"I want you to realize that the dog that hasn't barked is trump.\"Epstein added in that same email that a person whom the Democrats identified as a victim of his, whose name was redacted in the email, \"spent hours at my house with\" Trump.\"He has never once been mentioned,\" Epstein added in that message.It is not clear what Epstein was referring to in the email that said \"the dog that hasn't barked.\"CNBC has not independently verified the documents released by the Democrats.Trump has denied having known about Epstein's sexual abuse of underage girls and young women when they were socializing with each other. The president has never been charged with wrongdoing in connection with Epstein.Trump blasted the Democrats in a Truth Social post that accused them of using the Epstein documents to distract Americans from the cost of the U.S. government shutdown.\"The Democrats are trying to bring up the Jeffrey Epstein Hoax again because they'll do anything at all to deflect on how badly they've done on the Shutdown, and so many other subjects,\" Trump wrote.\"Only a very bad, or stupid, Republican would fall into that trap,\" he wrote.\"The Democrats cost our Country $1.5 Trillion Dollars with their recent antics of viciously closing our Country, while at the same time putting many at risk — and they should pay a fair price,\" Trump said.\"There should be no deflections to Epstein or anything else, and any Republicans involved should be focused only on opening up our Country, and fixing the massive damage caused by the Democrats!\"",

Aaron Schwartz | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesThe Supreme Court said Wednesday that it will hear oral arguments in the case challenging President Donald Trump's authority to fire Federal Reserve Gov. Lisa Cook on Jan. 21.Trump said on Aug. 25 that he was firing Cook, one of seven Fed governors, citing claims that she committed mortgage fraud in connection with two residences that she owns.Cook, who denies any wrongdoing, filed a lawsuit seeking to block her removal.A federal district court judge in Washington, D.C., in early September ruled that Cook could not be fired from the board while her suit was pending. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia soon after upheld that ruling, leading Trump to ask the Supreme Court to rule on his power to fire her.Read more CNBC politics coverageDemocrats win big on Election Night in key racesZohran Mamdani wins New York City mayor's race, NBC News projectsDemocratic candidate Mikie Sherrill wins New Jersey governor's race, NBC News projectsDemocrats win Virginia governor, attorney general races, NBC News projectsSNAP update: Trump admin will pay 50% of food stamp benefits in November amid shutdownTrump says he has 'no idea who' Binance's CZ is after pardoning himTrump backtracks on attending Supreme Court tariffs case argumentsIn the initial ruling blocking Cook's removal, District Court Judge Jia Cobb wrote, \"Cook has made a strong showing that her purported removal was done in violation of the Federal Reserve Act's 'for cause' provision.\"\"The best reading\" of that provision is that legal cause for removing a Fed governor is limited to actions related to their \"behavior in office,\" Cobb wrote.The allegations against Cook relate to conduct that predates her serving on the Fed.Solicitor General D. John Sauer, who is representing the Trump administration in the case, has argued in a filing with the Supreme Court that the president should be allowed to remove her while her suit is pending because she does not have \"a Fifth Amendment property interest in her continued service as a Governor of the Federal Reserve System.\"Sauer also wrote that although the Federal Reserve Act rules out removal for \"no reason at all, or for policy disagreement ... so long as the President identifies a cause, the determination of 'some cause relating to the conduct, ability, fitness, or competence of the officer' is within the President's unreviewable discretion.\"Trump tried to fire Cook, who is the first Black woman to serve on the Fed's Board of Governors, after months of unsuccessfully pressuring the board and Fed Chair Jerome Powell to lower interest rates.",

    "body": "Skims underwear is displayed on a shelf at a Nordstrom store on March 25, 2025 in Corte Madera, California. Justin Sullivan | Getty ImagesKim Kardashian's Skims brand has raised $225 million in new funding led by Goldman Sachs Alternatives, valuing the shapewear and apparel company at $5 billion — up from roughly $4 billion after its 2023 round.The deal comes as Skims nears $1 billion in annual net sales, six years after its 2019 launch, and marks one of the largest private raises for a U.S. consumer brand this year. BDT & MSD Partners' affiliated funds also joined the round, Skims said Wednesday.Skims plans to use the new capital to accelerate brick-and-mortar and international expansion, as well as product innovation and category diversification. The company has 18 stores across the U.S. in cities including New York, Los Angeles, Austin and Atlanta and one in Mexico, with plans to open additional stores overseas in 2026.Skims said it's laying the groundwork to become a \"predominantly physical business\" in the coming years, a pivot for a company that built its reputation as a digital-first direct-to-consumer brand.\"This milestone reflects continued confidence in our long-term vision and coupled with disciplined execution, positions Skims to unlock its next phase of growth,\" CEO and co-founder Jens Grede said in a statement.The new funding follows the debut of NikeSkims, a partnership with Nike that launched earlier this year and sold out within hours. The collaboration signals Skims' ambitions to scale beyond its core shapewear products and into activewear, apparel and performance categories, pushing the brand further into the mainstream athleticwear market dominated by Lululemon, a handful of upstarts and Nike itself.The new capital infusion could further delay an IPO from Skims. The company has been eyeing a public debut since at least 2024, based on statements by Grede.The consumer IPO market has been largely stagnant in 2024 and 2025, with few fashion or beauty brands debuting as investors turn cautious on discretionary retail. By raising new private funding, Skims can continue to scale without immediate pressure to list.\"Skims stands as a solutions-driven apparel innovator, pioneering new categories and redefining everyday wear,\" said Beat Cabiallavetta, global head of hybrid capital at Goldman Sachs Alternatives. \"We look forward to partnering with management to pursue significant opportunities and deliver disruptive, sustained growth.\"Since its launch, Skims has built a cult following with its inclusive sizing, minimalist aesthetic and high-profile campaigns featuring global athletes and celebrities. Kardashian, who serves as chief creative officer, said the new funding marks \"an exciting new chapter\" for the company.\"We can't wait to take Skims to the next level as we continue to innovate and set the standard for our industry,\" Kardashian said.",

Steve Scalise, R-La., said.\"We'll start the process probably around 4, 5 o'clock.

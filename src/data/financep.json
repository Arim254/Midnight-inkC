    "body": "Paramount Skydance CEO David Ellison speaks during the Bloomberg Screentime conference in Los Angeles on October 9, 2025.Patrick T. Fallon | Afp | Getty ImagesThis isn't exactly what David Ellison had planned in September. Just a few months ago, the Paramount Skydance CEO sent a letter to the Warner Bros. Discovery board of directors arguing a combination of the two media and entertainment companies made sense. That letter was the first of several that offered increasingly higher prices to acquire the company along with arguments of why the assets were better together.Paramount's interest spurred a formal sale process — bringing Comcast and Netflix into the mix — which ultimately doubled the value of Warner Bros. Discovery shares and culminated, at least for the moment, in Paramount losing out in the bidding war it started.  On Friday, Netflix announced a deal to acquire HBO Max and the famed Warner Bros. film studio for $27.75 per share, or an equity value of $72 billion. WBD will move forward with a plan to separate out its pay-TV networks, such as CNN and TNT Sports, before the deal closes. Instead of supercharging Paramount, just months after gaining control of the company through a merger with Skydance, Ellison effectively handed a prized jewel of the media and entertainment industry to its most dominant player, strengthening Netflix's reach and stripping Paramount and Comcast's NBCUniversal of an obvious merger target. \"It wasn't for sale before, and they certainly hadn't cleaned up the assets or separated the assets in the way they have right now,\" said Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos in a conference call Friday morning after announcing the deal. \"I think that kind of goes to the 'why now.'\"Ellison jump-started a process that has made a lot of money for Warner Bros. Discovery CEO David Zaslav, WBD's executive team and its shareholders. Zaslav's shareZaslav currently owns more than 4.2 million shares of Warner Bros. Discovery, with another 6.2 million shares that would be delivered to him in the future via previously granted stock awards, according to Equilar. Zaslav also has a grant of almost 20.9 million options with an exercise price of $10.16, Equilar found.Based on the Netflix-WBD transaction price of $27.75 per share, all of that adds up to more than $554 million for the WBD CEO. Factoring in another 4 million shares that Zaslav is set to receive in January, according to a person close to the situation who declined to be named speaking about the executive's holdings, the true total is closer to $660 million.For shareholders, the sale process has brought a similar windfall. Warner Bros. Discovery stock closed at $12.54 on Sept. 10, the day before The Wall Street Journal reported Paramount was preparing a bid for the company. On Friday morning, Warner Bros. Discovery shares were up almost 3% to more than $25 apiece. That's more than double Warner Bros. Discovery's unaffected sale process price and a return to 2022 levels when WarnerMedia and Discovery first merged. That's vindication for Zaslav, who has spent nearly four years coming under fire from Hollywood and investors for failing to deliver for shareholders. With Friday's announcement, he's effectively pulled victory from the jaws of defeat. And still, Paramount is likely not done with its pursuit of buying all of Warner Bros. Discovery.Paramount's hostile playEllison has wasted no time at the helm of Paramount Skydance, transforming the company through deals and acquisitions.Since the merger closed in August, Paramount has brought on C-suite executives and high-profile Hollywood talent such as the Duffer Brothers. It secured the rights to develop a live-action feature film based on Activision's Call of Duty video game franchise and struck a $7.7 billion deal for UFC rights. Ellison's hunt for Warner Bros. Discovery was his biggest endeavor since taking control of the company.Paramount's lawyers sent a letter to Warner Bros. Discovery this week, first reported by CNBC, claiming the sale process had been rigged in Netflix's direction. Paramount has accused Warner Bros. Discovery of failing to properly consider its offer of $30, all-cash, and instead selling to Netflix as a predetermined outcome. Netflix made an initial bid for WBD's studio and streaming assets of $27 a share, according to a person familiar with the matter. That trumped Paramount's offer at the time and turned the trajectory of the sales talks in Netflix's direction, said the person, who asked not to be named because the discussions were private.Paramount was the only bidder interested in acquiring all of WBD's assets — the film studio, streaming service and TV networks. It has maintained that its offer is superior. Paramount's executives and advisors valued the Discovery Global networks portfolio at close to $2 a share, based on its predicted trading multiple and estimated leverage ratio, according to people familiar with the matter, who asked not to be named because the discussions were private. Discovery Global would include the CNN, TNT Sports and Discovery channels.Warner Bros. Discovery believes Discovery Global could have a value of $3 per share or more if it trades well in the public markets, according to other people with direct knowledge of the matter.Paramount has also argued there are tax efficiencies for shareholders in acquiring the whole company rather than buying only a portion of it, and that Netflix's bid comes with steeper regulatory risk. The Trump administration's view of the proposed combination is one of \"heavy skepticism,\" CNBC reported Friday.Paramount offered a break-up fee of $5 billion if the proposed deal didn't get regulatory approval, according to the people familiar.  Netflix's bid included a $5.8 billion break-up fee in case the deal doesn't get regulatory approval, according to a Securities and Exchange Commission filing Friday. Paramount is now weighing its options about whether to go straight to shareholders with one more improved bid — perhaps even higher than the $30-per-share, all-cash offer it submitted to WBD this week. If it does, Netflix would have a chance to match that bid. The end result would mean even more money for WBD shareholders — and more money for Zaslav.— CNBC's Nick Wells contributed to this report.

    "body": "Dr. Vicky Pebsworth, from left, Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor Retsef Levi, Case Western Reserve University Professor Catherine Stein and Dr. Raymond Pollak, listen to presentations during an Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) meeting to discuss childhood vaccine schedule changes at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, Georgia, U.S., December 4, 2025.Alyssa Pointer | ReutersHealth and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s handpicked vaccine committee voted on Friday to do away with the long-standing, universal recommendation that all babies receive a hepatitis B shot at birth, issuing weaker guidance for certain infants. The group, called the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, or ACIP, recommended that parents use individual decision-making in consultation with a health-care provider to determine when or if to give the hepatitis B birth dose to a baby whose mother tested negative for the virus. For babies who don't receive the birth dose, the committee recommended that they wait to receive a first vaccine until they are at least 2 months old. The acting director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention still has to sign off on that new recommendation. The CDC currently recommends that every baby get vaccinated against hepatitis B within 24 hours of birth, regardless of their mother's testing status. The move overturns that guidance, which has been credited with driving down infections in children by 99% since it was first introduced three decades ago and is widely considered to be a public health success story. Some committee members and public health experts warn that the change could have wide-ranging consequences, such as an increase in infections among kids. The vote only affects the timing of the first dose of the hepatitis B vaccine series. The second would still be given one to two months after birth, with a third dose between 6 and 18 months of age. All pregnant people are supposed to be tested for hepatitis B during pregnancy. During previous meetings, some advisors questioned the need for babies to receive a shot if their mothers test negative. But test results can produce false negatives, some people become infected later in pregnancy after being tested and babies can get infected by other members of their household. The panel's closely watched two-day meeting in Atlanta comes after Kennedy gutted the committee and appointed 12 new members, including some well-known vaccine critics. ACIP sets recommendations on who should receive certain shots and which vaccines insurers must cover at no cost. Eight members voted yes, while three voted no. Some advisors strongly pushed back on the new guidance ahead of the vote. \"This has a great potential to cause harm, and I hope that the committee accepts the responsibility when this harm is caused,\" said Dr. Joseph Hibbeln, psychiatrist and voting member. Dr. Cody Meissner, voting member and professor of pediatrics at the Dartmouth Geisel School of Medicine, said he hopes that pediatricians will continue to administer the birth dose within the first 24 hours of delivery and before discharge from the hospital. \"To follow any other course is not in the interest of infants,\" he said. Meissner added that more children will be injured and will catch hepatitis B infections. Hepatitis B, which can be passed from mother to baby during childbirth, can lead to liver disease and early death. Infants are more vulnerable to developing chronic hepatitis B infections, which have no cure. \"We will see hepatitis B come back,\" he said. \"The vaccine is so effective. It does not make sense in my mind to change the immunization schedule.\"In a statement Friday, the American Medical Association said the vote is \"reckless and undermines decades of public confidence in a proven, lifesaving vaccine.\" The group added that the decision was not based on scientific evidence and \"creates confusion for parents about how best to protect their newborns.\"Meanwhile, Retsef Levi, a voting member and Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor, falsely claimed during meetings that experts have \"never tested\" the hepatitis B vaccine \"appropriately.\" Some committee members raised concerns about vaccinating during the so-called neonatal period, which is a critical window of development for the brain and immune system. But decades of evidence show that the hepatitis B shot has been safely administered to newborns. Other advisors said there is no evidence supporting the two-month delay to the birth dose.\"We have to make decisions with the data that we have, and we must use only the credible data to make the decisions, and not speculations and not hypotheses,\" said Hibbeln. A 2024 CDC study showed that the current vaccination schedule has helped prevent more than 6 million hepatitis B infections and nearly 1 million hepatitis B-related hospitalizations.Merck and GSK manufacture the hepatitis B vaccines used starting at birth. Neither of the shots are significant revenue drivers for the companies, so the new recommendations should not have a material impact on their businesses. Still, Merck said in a statement Friday that it is \"deeply concerned\" by the vote, which it said risks \"reversing this progress and puts infants at unnecessary risk of chronic infection, liver cancer and even death.\" The company added that \"there is no evidence delaying it provides any benefit to children.\" In a statement, GSK said, \"we await additional information and an official adoption of today's recommendations by CDC to fully understand the potential impact.\"The panel's vote will not affect insurance coverage for the shots, including under Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program, Andrew Johnson, principal policy analyst for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid, told the members during the meeting.

The stock climbed 13% over the past five days, its best weekly performance since December 2023.The company reported adjusted earnings per share of $3.25, topping Wall Street's estimates of $2.86 per share. Revenue increased 8.6% year over year to $10.26 billion but just missed analyst projections of $10.27 billion.Although the artificial intelligence boom has pushed several tech companies into record surges, cloud software firms have seen a rocky year as investors wonder whether AI will render the industry obsolete.Salesforce is hoping to persuade Wall Street that AI will be able to bolster its products rather than replace them. Investors \"somehow think software companies are under arrest from AI, when the opposite is true,\" Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff told CNBC's Jim Cramer on Thursday.During the third quarter, the company acquired startups Regrello and Waii, which uses AI to generate code with natural language instructions.Despite Salesforce's shares being down 22% year to date, compared with the Nasdaq's 22% gain, analysts are more optimistic for 2026. \"CRM [Salesforce] continues to be levered to digital transformation, and we expect the company to grow at a solid rate going forward,\" Mizuho analysts wrote. \"At the same time, we believe CRM will remain fiscally disciplined and that it can continue to drive higher operating and FCF margins.\"Analysts highlighted Salesforce's AI platform Agentforce, which builds agents that automate business tasks and streamline workflow. Despite initial investor skepticism over the platform, Cantor analysts were encouraged by its strong adoption in the customer service space.\"We think CRM is starting to formalize and mature the strategy, which should make it easier for customers to understand, and therefore adopt, Agentforce,\" the Cantor analysts wrote.Annual recurring revenue of Agentforce jumped 330% year over year to $540 million.\"Why everyone is so excited about Agentforce is because this is what AI was meant to be,\" Benioff said. \"It brings together humans and data and AI and apps, and delivers an incredible experience for companies.\"WATCH: Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff goes one-on-one with Jim Cramer",

    "body": "The logo for Google LLC is seen at the Google Store Chelsea in Manhattan, New York City, U.S., November 17, 2021. Andrew Kelly | ReutersA U.S. judge on Friday added new details to the remedies resulting from Google's antitrust case, finalizing the consequences the company faces after its defeat last year.In mid-2024, Google was found to hold an illegal monopoly in its core market of internet search, and in September of this year, U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta ruled against the most severe consequences that were proposed by the Department of Justice, including a forced sale of Google's Chrome browser.Google was, however, ordered to loosen its hold on search data.Mehta on Friday issued additional details for his ruling. \"The age-old saying 'the devil is in the details' may not have been devised with the drafting of an antitrust remedies judgment in mind, but it sure does fit,\" Mehta wrote in one of the Friday filings. Mehta wrote that Google can't enter into any deal like the one it's had with Apple \"unless the agreement terminates no more than one year after the date it is entered.\" Google pays billions of dollars per year to Apple to be the default search engine on the Safari browser on iPhones, Macs and iPads.The judge's ruling includes deals involving generative artificial intelligence products, and any \"application, software, service, feature, tool, functionality, or product\" that involve or use genAI or large language models.GenAI \"plays a significant role in these remedies,\" Mehta wrote.Mehta on Friday also included requirements on the makeup of a technical committee that will determine with whom Google must share its data. Committee \"members shall be experts in some combination of software engineering, information retrieval, artificial intelligence, economics, behavioral science, and data privacy and data security,\" the filing says.The judge went on to say that no committee member can have a conflict of interest, such as having worked for Google or any of its competitors in the six months prior to or one year after serving in the role.Mehta said the committee must \"have access to Google's source code and algorithms, subject to a confidentiality agreement,\" and reiterated the web index data it will require Google to share with certain competitors. Google has to share some of the raw search interaction data it uses to train its ranking and AI systems, but not the actual algorithms. In September, Mehta said those data sets represent a \"small fraction\" of Google's overall traffic, but argued the company's models are trained on data that contributed to Google's edge over competitors.In August 2024, Mehta ruled that Google violated Section 2 of the Sherman Act and held a monopoly in search and related advertising. The antitrust trial started in September 2023.Google did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The company has previously said it will appeal the judge's monopoly ruling.WATCH: Judge Issues final remedies in Google antitrust casewatch now",

The Commission on Friday said breaches include \"the deceptive design of its 'blue checkmark', the lack of transparency of its advertising repository, and the failure to provide access to public data for researchers.\"The ruling follows a two-year investigation under the Digital Services Act (DSA), which was adopted in 2022 to regulate online platforms. The Commission said that failure to comply with the decision may lead to penalty payments.\"Deceiving users with blue checkmarks, obscuring information on ads and shutting out researchers have no place online in the EU,\" said Henna Virkkunen, executive vice president for tech sovereignty, security and democracy.\"With the DSA's first non-compliance decision, we are holding X responsible for undermining users' rights and evading accountability.\"X didn't respond to CNBC's request for comment. In a reply on X to a post from the European Commission, Musk wrote, \"Bulls---.\"Musk's social network now has 60 days to tell the Commission how it plans to address the issues with \"deceptive\" blue checkmarks, and 90 days to submit a plan to resolve the issues with its ads repository, and access to its public data for researchers.\"Failure to comply with the non-compliance decision may lead to periodic penalty payments,\" the Commission said in a statement.The fine comes a day after the commission announced it would investigate whether Meta breached antitrust rules around a new policy on allowing AI providers' access to WhatsApp.In recent months, the US has been pressuring Europe to soften, or abandon, its rules for big tech companies, including the Digital Services Act, Digital Markets Act and other AI regulations that are under consideration.",

Musk, who is the CEO of both companies, said he doesn't love running publicly traded businesses, in part because they draw \"spurious lawsuits,\" and can \"make it very difficult to operate effectively.\"However, Musk said during the meeting that he wanted to \"try to figure out some way for Tesla shareholders to participate in SpaceX,\" adding, \"maybe at some point, SpaceX should become a public company despite all the downsides.\"WATCH: What retail investors should know about OpenAI and SpaceXwatch now",

    "body": "Logos of Netlfix and Warner Bros.ReutersThe Netflix and Warner Bros. Discovery deal came together quickly — but its path to regulatory approval may not be so speedy. Netflix stunned the media industry on Friday when it announced its proposed $72 billion deal to acquire the iconic Warner Bros. film studio and streaming service HBO Max. The combination brings together two of the most popular streaming platforms in the business. Netflix reported 300 million global subscribers as of late 2024, the last time it reported the metric. HBO Max had 128 million customers as of Sept. 30.  Netflix currently claims 46% of mobile app monthly active users in global streaming, according to data from market intelligence firm Sensor Tower. Combined with HBO Max, that share would rise to 56%, it found. \"This deal cements Netflix's position as the premier streaming service for original content,\" according to a research note from analysts at William Blair on Friday.The size of the deal makes it ripe for scrutiny, from both industry insiders and U.S. lawmakers. The Trump administration is viewing the merger with \"heavy skepticism,\" CNBC reported Friday, and Sen. Elizabeth Warren has already called for an antitrust review. \"This deal looks like an anti-monopoly nightmare. A Netflix-Warner Bros. would create one massive media giant with control of close to half of the streaming market — threatening to force Americans into higher subscription prices and fewer choices over what and how they watch, while putting American workers at risk,\" Warren, a Democrat from Massachusetts, said in a statement. The merger would also give Netflix control over the famed Warner Bros. film studio, further consolidating the cinematic space and raising concerns that the number or typical windowing of popular releases could shrink. It's typical in the days and weeks following a deal announcement of this scale for interest groups, politicians and corporate competitors to call foul on antitrust grounds. The Department of Justice is most likely to review the deal, as it has other media mergers in the past, and it could take some time. DOJ reviews can take anywhere from months to more than a year. Netflix said Friday it expects the transaction to close in 12 to 18 months, after Warner Bros. Discovery spins out its portfolio of cable networks into Discovery Global. Netflix confidenceTed Sarandos, co-chief executive officer of Netflix , attends the annual Allen & Co. Media and Technology Conference in Sun Valley, Idaho on July 11th, 2025.David A. Grogan | CNBCNetflix executives on Friday said they were \"highly confident\" the deal would win regulatory approval.\"You know, this deal is pro-consumer, pro-innovation, pro-worker, it's pro-creator, it's pro-growth,\" Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos said during an investor call following the acquisition announcement. \"Our plans here are to work really closely with all the appropriate governments and regulators, but [we're] really confident that we're going to get all the necessary approvals that we need,\" Sarandos added. As part of the deal, Netflix has agreed to pay a $5.8 billion breakup fee to Warner Bros. Discovery if the deal were to get blocked by the government. Netflix's bid won out over competing offers from Paramount Skydance and Comcast. Analysts at Deutsche Bank and William Blair were at least minimally convinced Friday of the potential for the deal to go through. \"A merger of Warner Bros. Discovery and any of the three bidders would probably succeed, even if the DOJ were to sue to block a proposed combination,\" Deutsche Bank analysts wrote in a note on Friday, citing insights from a Department of Justice veteran who the analysts said \"does not see any significant antitrust problems with any of the three scenarios.\" \"However ... we don't know all of the detailed facts that will be collected and analyzed by the DOJ, nor do we know who the judge hearing the case will be, and both of these factors can have an impact on the outcome,\" the Deutsche Bank analysts noted.  Paramount, for its part, has been fanning the flames. Paramount's lawyers sent a letter to Warner Bros. Discovery this week, first reported by CNBC, in which it argued the sale process had been rigged in Netflix's direction. The Wall Street Journal reported that in a separate letter, Paramount said a Netflix transaction would likely \"never close\" because of regulatory headwinds. Paramount was the only bidder looking to buy WBD's massive portfolio of pay-TV networks — and it's unlikely to walk away from the process quietly. Not so fastOracle co-founder, CTO and Executive Chairman Larry Ellison (C), U.S. President Donald Trump, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman (R), and SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son (2nd-R), share a laugh as Ellison uses a stool to stand on as he speaks during a news conference in the Roosevelt Room of the White House on January 21, 2025 in Washington, DC. Trump announced an investment in artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure and took questions on a range of topics including his presidential pardons of Jan. 6 defendants, the war in Ukraine, cryptocurrencies and other topics.Andrew Harnik | Getty ImagesWall Street expected President Donald Trump's second term to usher in a windfall of dealmaking. However, economic uncertainty has slowed the process for some companies, and regulatory holdups have played a bigger role than anticipated.  \"Under Donald Trump, the antitrust review process has also become a cesspool of political favoritism and corruption,\" Warren said in Friday's statement. \"The Justice Department must enforce our nation's anti-monopoly laws fairly and transparently — not use the Warner Bros. deal review to invite influence-peddling and bribery.\" Paramount's merger with Skydance was left in limbo for more than a year before it finally won federal approval in July. The Federal Communications Commission (which is unlikely to review the Netflix-WBD tie-up since it doesn't involve a broadcaster) signed off on the $8 billion merger shortly after Paramount agreed to pay $16 million to Trump to settle a lawsuit over the editing of a \"60 Minutes\" interview with former Vice President Kamala Harris. Paramount had also ended its diversity, equity and inclusion policies earlier in the year after the FCC said it would investigate the company over its DEI programs. In September, the newly combined Paramount Skydance, run by David Ellison, set its sights on Warner Bros. Discovery. The company is now considering whether to take a hostile bid straight to WBD shareholders and try to unseat Netflix as the would-be buyer, CNBC reported Friday. Ellison's billionaire father, Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison, is known to be close with Trump. The argument for whether to clear Netflix's proposed takeover of Warner Bros. would likely come down to questions around streaming — first, on pricing for consumers, and second, on how to define Netflix's audience. The pricing of streaming subscriptions has risen across the board in recent years. In 2022 Netflix instituted a cheaper, ad-supported model after years of resistance in an effort to beckon more customers. The following year, Disney followed with its own more-affordable plan. Netflix is used to upending the legacy media industry. The company ended its DVD rentals business in 2023 and went all in on streaming. It's since found massive scale and has taken over the zeitgeist with original series like \"Squid Game,\" \"Wednesday,\" \"Stranger Things,\" and \"Bridgerton.\" Its maverick approach to media and its broadening foothold in the industry may be its saving grace in the eyes of regulators. \"My expectation on the regulatory side is Netflix is going to advocate and argue with their advisors for a very expansive definition of what their market is ... so that would include broadcast, cable, subscription and ad-supported streaming,\" said said Jeff Goldstein, a partner and managing director at AlixPartners, and co-lead of the U.S. Media group. \"And really, really, really importantly, that would include YouTube,\" he said.YouTube has come to dominate the industry when it comes to viewership. Nielsen once again reported in October than YouTube had the largest share of TV usage, with Netflix in sixth place and Warner Bros. Discovery in seventh place. Traditional media companies with linear networks — Disney, NBCUniversal, Fox and Paramount — filled the spots in between. Critics of the deal will define Netflix's reach more narrowly to try to demonstrate outsized dominance, said Goldstein. \"I believe that streaming is not a category. Television viewership is a category ... you know, eyeballs might be a category,\" media industry titan John Malone told CNBC in November when asked about antitrust questions surrounding the WBD sale process. \"But if you're going to broaden the category to that, you got to take in YouTube and Facebook and the social networks, TikTok,\" he said. \"I mean, that's really the question, is streaming a category? ... Are studios a category ... and is that going to get looked at hard? These regulatory things are a little bit difficult to predict.\" — CNBC's Julia Boorstin contributed to this report.

    "body": "watch nowNetflix announced Friday it's reached a deal to buy pieces of Warner Bros. Discovery, bringing a swift end to a dramatic bidding process that saw Paramount Skydance and Comcast also vying for the legacy assets. The transaction is comprised of cash and stock and is valued at $27.75 per WBD share, the companies said. That puts the equity value of the deal at $72 billion, with a total enterprise value of approximately $82.7 billion. Netflix will acquire Warner Bros.' film studio and streaming service, HBO Max. Warner Bros. Discovery will move forward with its previously planned spinout of Discovery Global, which includes its massive portfolio of pay TV networks, such as TNT and CNN. The blockbuster deal brings together the streaming giant Netflix, which has upended the media industry in recent years, and the storied Warner Bros. film studio, known for its library including \"The Wizard of Oz,\" the Harry Potter franchise and the DC comics universe. It will also include the content of HBO Max, including \"The Sopranos\" and \"Game of Thrones.\"\"I know some of you're surprised that we're making this acquisition, and I certainly understand why. Over the years, we have been known to be builders, not buyers,\" Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos said on an investor call Friday morning. \"We already have incredible shows and movies and a great business model, and it's working for talent, it's working for consumers and it's working for shareholders. This is a rare opportunity,\" he said. \"It's going to help us achieve our mission to entertain the world and to bring people together through great stories.\"Netflix's initial bid for WBD's studio and streaming assets was for $27 a share, according to a person familiar with the matter. That trumped Paramount's offer at the time and turned the trajectory of the sales talks in Netflix's direction, said the person, who asked not to be named because the discussions were private.The acquisition is expected to close after the TV networks separation takes place, now expected in the third quarter of 2026. The companies estimated the transaction would close in 12 to 18 months. CNBC has reached out to Comcast and Paramount for comment.As part of the deal, every Warner Bros. Discovery shareholder will receive $23.25 in cash and $4.50 in shares of Netflix common stock for each share of WBD common stock outstanding following the close of the deal. Netflix and Warner Bros. Discovery said each of their boards of directors unanimously approved the deal, which is subject to regulatory approval as well as approval of WBD shareholders. Netflix has agreed to pay a $5.8 billion reverse break-up fee if the deal is not approved, according to a Securities and Exchange Commission filing. Warner Bros. Discovery would pay a $2.8 billion breakup fee if it decides to call off the deal to pursue a different merger.Edging out ParamountThe merger could invite regulatory scrutiny given the size of the expansive streaming businesses for each company. Netflix said it surpassed 300 million global streaming subscribers at the end of 2024, the last time it publicly reported its customer count. Warner Bros. Discovery said it had 128 million global subscribers as of Sept. 30. Paramount raised the potential for antitrust concerns earlier this week in a letter to Warner Bros. Discovery management as second-round bids came in, The Wall Street Journal reported. The newly merged Paramount Skydance made its initial run at Warner Bros. Discovery in September, submitting three bids before WBD launched a formal sale process. The David Ellison-run company was the only suitor bidding for the entirety of WBD's portfolio — the film studio, streaming business and TV networks.Paramount's final bid, received Thursday evening, was for $30 per share, all cash, people close to the matter told CNBC, speaking on the condition of anonymity about confidential dealings. Paramount's offer included a $5 billion breakup fee if the transaction didn't win regulatory approval after roughly 10 months, the people said. Earlier this week, Paramount raised questions about the \"fairness and adequacy\" of the sale process, contending Warner Bros. Discovery favored Netflix.\"It has become increasingly clear, through media reporting and otherwise, that WBD appears to have abandoned the semblance and reality of a fair transaction process, thereby abdicating its duties to stockholders, and embarked on a myopic process with a predetermined outcome that favors a single bidder,\" Paramount attorneys said in a letter to Warner Bros. Discovery management.— CNBC's David Faber, Kasey O'Brien and Laya Neelakandan contributed to this report.Disclosure: Comcast is the parent company of NBCUniversal, which owns CNBC.

Shares rebounded on Friday, closing 1.88% higher.HPE beat earnings expectations for Q4, with adjusted earnings of 62 cents per share coming in above the 58 cents per share expected by LSEG.CFO Marie Myers said on the earnings call with analysts that the adjustments came from the \"amortization of intangible assets, Juniper-related acquisition costs, stock-based compensation expense and cost reduction plan expense, partially offset by adjustments for taxes and other adjustments.\"The company reaffirmed the fiscal year 2026 revenue outlook range of 17% to 22%, but issued weak guidance for the first quarter.The company said it expects fiscal 2026 first-quarter revenue in the range of $9 billion to $9.4 billion, which was short of the $9.87 billion expected by FactSet analysts.Rising costs, seasonality and the timing of AI server deals were all factors in the guidance.Read more CNBC tech newsElon Musk's X fined $140 million by European Commission over 'deceptive' blue checkmark and lack of transparency'China's Nvidia' Moore Threads surges over 400% on trading debut after $1.1 billion listingApple announces departure of general counsel and policy chiefMicrosoft will raise prices of commercial Office subscriptions in JulyThe revenue dip from Q4 is \"in line with historic seasonality,\" Myers told analysts. She also noted continued cost increases in DRAM, dynamic random access memory, and NAND memory, a flash memory typically used in memory cards.She told analysts the majority of those costs are expected to be passed along.AI system orders reached $1.9 billion in the fourth quarter, and Myers said the company expects AI demand to be \"uneven,\" with larger sovereign customers making orders with extended lead times that can defer shipments to future quarters.Neri said on the analyst call that the company expects the biggest part of the AI revenue conversion to land in the back half of FY2026.Revenue for HPE's server segment during Q4 came in at $4.46 billion, down 5% from the $4.68 billion a year ago. The fourth-quarter number missed StreetAccount analyst expectations of $4.58 billion.Myers addressed the shortfall on the earnings call, attributing it to the timing of AI service shipments and lower-than-expected government spending.\"Despite these headwinds, we were encouraged by robust server order growth across both traditional server and AI offerings, with demand significantly outpacing revenue in this period,\" she said.Server revenue declined 10% from the third quarter.Networking revenue of $2.81 billion during Q4 was a bright spot, and saw a boost from the completed acquisition of Juniper Networks in July.Neri told CNBC Friday that the acquisition makes HPE \"a networking-centric company.\"HPE reported net income of $146 million during the fourth quarter, or 11 cents per share, which was much lower than the net income of $1.34 billion, or 99 cents per share, from a year ago.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconHPE one-day stock chart.",

I buy them mostly out of vanity: The pens make my my twirly handwriting look neater, and the ink is smear-proof (even for a lefty like me). They're also comfortable to write with, so much so that I get cranky when I have to use any other kind of pen. A pack of 12 lasts me the entire year — I use every pen until the ink runs out.— Megan Sauer, Success Reporter3. Weekly meal plannerPrice: $17.50After years of scrawling grocery lists on notepads and Post-It notes, I purchased a meal planner from Rifle Paper Company on a whim. I've always been the type of person who believes buying a new notebook will magically improve my life, despite knowing it's, well, just paper. But this pad has definitely made things easier. I'm able to visually plan out my meals for the week while simultaneously making a grocery list. Perforated edges make it easy to separate the list from the rest of the page, so I can hang my plan on the fridge. Plus, it's pretty, which never hurts in making chores more palatable.— Emmie Martin, Money Editor4. Gentle dog shampooPrice: $24I've been using the Lagenu Oatmeal Shampoo from Pup Studio NYC for my maltipoo, and it's worth every penny. The results are salon-level. The natural ingredients, like biotin and aloe vera, are gentle enough for sensitive skin, and there are no harsh chemicals. After every bath, his coat is soft, fluffy and smells heavenly!— Vanna Ben'Ous, Senior Editor, Contributors5. Affordable sunglassesPrice: $25A definite must-have for me for the summer (or really any sunny day) is Goodr sunglasses. Finding a decent pair of sunglasses has always been a pain for me. They're either ridiculously expensive or have cheap non-polarized lenses. Goodrs are affordable, fun and stylish, and they actually stay on my head without feeling like they're cutting off the circulation to my brain.— Zach Green, Video Producer6. Kitchen scalePrice: $25As someone whose job involves sitting down and staring at a screen approximately 90% of the time, futzing around the kitchen and doing something with my hands besides typing and clicking feels like an epiphany. It's probably why I find cooking and baking so therapeutic. But baking in particular also rewards precision and care. So, I bought myself a kitchen scale, the same top pick from Wirecutter my parents and brother already owned. I can now measure the exact number of grams of flour, sugar and anything else going into the bowl rather than hope that what I scooped, leveled or packed is close enough. It helps me get the right consistency and results I feel more confident sharing.— Stav Ziv, Contributors Editor7. Foldable blanketPrice: $30I take my Matador pocket blanket with me everywhere in the summer. It's about the size of an iPhone, but unfolds into a tarp large enough for two adults to sit on. The small size makes it easy to throw into my bag and have ready for a spontaneous park hang or bring along for a dry place to sit during a hike. Plus, it's super easy to clean.— Emmie Martin, Money Editor8. On-the-go neck fanPrice: $32Hot summers in New York City are bad enough, but it's somehow worse on the subway platforms, where poor air circulation and a lack of air conditioning routinely push temperatures past 100 degrees. Tired of the sweaty commutes, I finally picked up a portable neck fan this summer — and I've got to say, it actually works. The model I use has a strong, quiet motor that keeps my neck cool and my hair dry. It's less effective once temperatures top 100 degrees, but still a big improvement over the handheld electric fan I was using and much better than nothing at all. These days, I use it often when I'm outside in the heat.— Mike Winters, Money Reporter9. Spiral-bound plannerPrice: $35The one desk item that I'm willing to splurge on is my planner. I am very picky. I need a planner that has plenty of space for my daily to-do list — a monthly calendar just isn't enough. It also has to be big enough for normal handwriting and a pretty cover is the cherry on top. This spiral-bound planner from Paper Source has helped me stay organized all year.— Sophie Caldwell, Associate Work Reporter10. Dry shampooPrice: $48I balked at the price of the K-18 AirWash Dry Shampoo when I first saw it — $48 is a lot of money to spend on a hair product like that. But now that I've tried it, I'm never going back to regular dry shampoo. To put it simply, the K-18 AirWash is magical. It's damp when it sprays onto your hair, but within about 30 seconds, any oil that was there is completely gone. My hair feels fresh and clean every time I use it and it doesn't leave a chalky residue like other dry shampoos.Also, it lasts a really long time. I've used this product every other day for months and there's still a lot left in the bottle.— Ashley Turner, Director of Social Media11. Fleece-lined glovesPrice: $50After two years of of searching, I finally found my Holy Grail of gloves. My qualifications are twofold: Warm enough for hourlong winter walks, particularly in the fingertips.Thin enough to maintain dexterity, so I can tie up my dog's poop bags without having to take my gloves off. The Craft Sportswear ADV Lumen Hybrid Gloves have optional mitten covers — warm, fleece-lined ones — which helps them check my first box. I stow the mitten covers away, quickly popping them into a pocket on the backs of the hands, when I need to clean up after my dog or give her a treat. An unexpected bonus: They're available at REI, so you can try them on before you buy them, an oft-forgotten perk in today's e-commerce age.— Cameron Albert-Deitch, Success EditorCNBC Make It independently determines what we cover and recommend in the \"Worth the Money\" section.

    "body": "Jocelyn Elizabeth was a new mom working part-time as a marketing administrator when her dad brought home a $5 lamp from a church yard sale in Dillsburg, Pennsylvania.It was 2011, Elizabeth says. Though the lamp wasn't fancy or new, her dad was sure he'd made a good investment, and found a cleaned-up version of the same lamp listed at $70 on eBay. Elizabeth says she promptly went thrifting the next weekend, intending to flip her finds for a profit online, her baby son tagging along in a stroller.Elizabeth, who uses her middle name professionally and asked not to share her last name, now makes her full-time living from her thrifting-centric YouTube channel Crazy Lamp Lady and her online thrifting marketplace NikNax, she says. NikNax hosts more than 5,000 other sellers listing resale items ranging from mugs and glassware to jewelry, books, trading cards and local snacks.NikNax has brought in more than $5.2 million in 2025 revenue, as of Oct. 31, according to documents reviewed by CNBC Make It. Elizabeth, 37, keeps a 5% cut of each sale, meaning she's personally received at least $260,000 from the marketplace so far this year. District, the online platform that hosts NikNax, also takes a 5% cut of each sale.DON'T MISS: The ultimate guide to starting a business—everything you need to know to be your own bossElizabeth also sells her own thrift finds on NikNax, and her store is responsible for about 5% of NikNax's total sales, she says. Her YouTube channel has also brought in roughly $298,000 in 2025 advertising revenue as of Oct. 15, documents show.Both NikNax and the YouTube channel are profitable, says Elizabeth. She employs two other people who help with listing and shipping her thrift finds, she adds. She works about three days per week on NikNax, and two or three days on her YouTube channel — and her working hours vary significantly, she says.\"These days, I spend anywhere from 50 to 100 hours a week working. It really depends on what's going on. Some weeks I'm doing more thrifting trips, and other weeks I'm focused on selling,\" says Elizabeth, a mom of three. \"NikNax has become such a big part of my daily life that even when I'm not actively selling, I'm usually watching other shows, chatting, or listing items. It's technically work, but a lot of it just feels like part of my everyday routine.\"Here's how she built her YouTube channel side hustle and turned thrifting into her full-time job.'It was definitely risky'When Elizabeth first discovered thrift flipping in 2011, she was making $14 per hour at a part-time corporate marketing job, she says. Soon, she started traveling to antique shows and stores across the U.S., studying the vintage and collectible secondary market and developing an eye for items with a higher resale value.By April 2016, she felt unfulfilled sending marketing emails to clients every day, she says — so she decided to launch a YouTube channel dedicated to her thrifting. Her first inkling that this could become a real money-making business was the first time she made $600 in advertising revenue in one day, she says.\"I remember having to pull over my car and just be like, 'What in the world is happening?'\" says Elizabeth.By the end of 2018, Elizabeth was \"consistently earning more from YouTube than from my part-time job,\" she says — so she quit her marketing gig that December. \"I was like, 'You know what? I don't want to be here anymore' ... It was definitely risky, and it was scary.\"Roughly six months later, Elizabeth had a house full of antiques and five employees, two who listed items on eBay and three who packed and shipped them. Elizabeth says she brought on three more employees during the Covid-19 pandemic, as declining ad revenue pushed her to try selling more on eBay. She also grew dissatisfied with seller fees on the platform, she says.In October 2023, she launched a marketplace on District — an internet platform founded in 2022 — after being invited by a company representative who'd seen her YouTube channel. District currently hosts 98 marketplaces, according to its website, including NikNax.Elizabeth also rents a commercial space to store her own thrift finds, and a separate operating space for day-to-day responsibilities like listing and shipping orders. Combined, those spaces roughly cost $2,000 to $3,000 per month including utilities, she says.The challenges of owning a marketplaceOwning a marketplace — rather than just being a seller — presents a new set of challenges, Elizabeth says. Online trends shift quickly, and staying on top of them can be difficult. Livestream sales, where you sell items in real time to buyers actively watching your live video feed, are a major sales driver for NikNax, but Elizabeth wasn't initially comfortable in front of a live camera, she says.She's also responsible for enforcing platform rules, like removing people who make rude comments or determining whether a buyer is falsely claiming that an item wasn't shipped to get an illicit refund.Building a community of buyers and sellers, on the other hand, was fairly easy, she says: She brought some of her YouTube audience with her, and now casts many of her NikNax livestreams on YouTube and other social channels to market the platform.Elizabeth has used some of her earnings to invest in real estate, purchasing an Airbnb rental property and a separate rental home in Pennsylvania. Each three-bedroom house cost around $300,000, she says. The Airbnb runs guests roughly $300 per night, including fees, according to the rental platform.Anyone can replicate her experience — from thrift flipping to YouTube and NikNax — to a certain degree, as long as you have the \"drive\" and dedication, she says. She travels the country at least once a month looking for thrift items to flip, while filming and editing online content and livestreaming multiple times per week, she says.Still, even if you only have a few dollars in your pocket, you could turn that into a profit if you know what to look for, she notes.\"I think anyone can do it if they put the work in,\" says Elizabeth. \"Anyone could go to Goodwill and pick something up and be like, 'Oh my gosh, how much is this worth?' And find out it's worth $50 ... If you're willing to put in the work, if you're willing to learn, I think anyone can really accomplish this.\"Earn more and get ahead with CNBC's online courses.

    "body": "US President Donald Trump makes an announcement from the Oval Office of the White House in Washington, DC on December 3, 2025. Andrew Caballero-reynolds | Afp | Getty ImagesPresident Donald Trump may remove members of the National Labor Relations Board and the Merit Systems Protection Board at will, a federal appeals court ruled Friday.The 2-1 decision from a panel of judges in Washington, D.C., reverses lower-court rulings blocking Trump's attempts to fire members of the key labor and employment panels.\"Congress may not restrict the President's ability to remove principal officers who wield substantial executive power,\" the two-judge majority wrote, citing a 2020 case known as Seila Law LLC v. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.They determined that another key court precedent, which was cited in the prior rulings that favored the fired board members, did not apply to the NLRB and MSPB.Those boards \"wield substantial powers that are both executive in nature and different from the powers\" that are covered by the removal protections laid out in the 1935 case known as Humphrey's Executor, the majority wrote.\"So, Congress cannot restrict the President's ability to remove NLRB or MSPB members,\" ruled Judges Gregory Katsas and Justin Walker, who were both appointed to the D.C. circuit by Trump.The Trump administration is challenging the 90-year-old precedent set by Humphrey's, which limits the president's ability to unilaterally remove the heads of certain independent government agencies. The Supreme Court on Monday is set to hear oral arguments in a case that could determine whether Humphrey's is overturned. The third judge on the appellate panel, Florence Pan, warned in a strongly worded dissent that Friday's ruling significantly increases the president's power.\"Today, my colleagues make us the first court to strike down the independence of a traditional multimember expert agency,\" Pan, an appointee of former President Joe Biden, wrote.\"Under my colleagues' reasoning, it appears that no independent agencies may lawfully exist in this country,\" she wrote. \"Their determination that the MSPB cannot be independent ... suggests that no agencies can be independent.\"Pan added that her colleagues \"redefine the type of executive power that must be placed under the exclusive command of the President, and effectively grant him dominion over approximately thirty-three previously independent agencies.\"Katsas and Walker noted that their opinion does \"not address whether Congress may restrict the President's ability to remove members of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.\"They pointed to a Supreme Court ruling from May, which, while allowing Trump to temporarily fire two NLRB and MSPB members, identified \"a 'distinct historical tradition' regarding the treatment of congressionally chartered banks, which may bear on Congress's ability to restrict the removal of their officials.\"Trump has tried to remove Fed Governor Lisa Cook, a Biden nominee, while urging the central bank and its chairman, Jerome Powell, to quickly slash U.S. interest rates. Cook sued to block her removal; the Supreme Court is set to hear oral arguments in the case on Jan. 21.Friday's ruling also does not touch on whether Congress can restrict the president's ability to fire members from certain agencies that have \"solely adjudicatory functions,\" Katsas and Walker noted.They cited the \"War Claims Commission,\" a temporary agency established after World War II to adjudicate compensation claims from American prisoners of war, as an example.Katsas and Walker additionally did not weigh in on \"whether wrongfully removed principal officers may obtain declaratory, equitable, or mandatory relief against the President or other government officials,\" they wrote.",

    "body": "Hampton Dumpty is the new corporate mascot for Willow Wealth, formerly known as Yieldstreet. The company is rebranding as its customers reel from investment losses.Source: Willow WealthAs Yieldstreet tries to distance itself from a rocky past with a new name and ad campaign, its customers are dealing with a present reality that is increasingly dire.The private markets investing startup, freshly rebranded as Willow Wealth, last week informed customers of new defaults on real estate projects in Houston and Nashville, Tennessee, CNBC has learned.The letters, obtained and verified by CNBC, account for about $41 million in new losses. They come on the heels of $89 million in marine loan wipeouts disclosed in September and $78 million in losses revealed by CNBC in an August report.In total, Willow Wealth investors have lost at least $208 million, according to CNBC reporting.Willow Wealth also removed a decade of historical performance data from public view in recent weeks. A chart on the company's website showing annualized returns of negative 2% for real estate investments from 2015 to 2025 — down from 9.4% gains just two years prior — has been taken down.\"They had to change their name,\" said Mark Williams, a professor at Boston University's Questrom School of Business. \"Their old name had negative value to it, so they're trying to do a 2.0 to restart things. They're also making it harder to uncover their poor performance by removing the stats, which is alarming.\"The high-stakes rebranding is the latest chapter for a company that sought to empower retail investors, but instead left some of them saddled with deep losses and years of uncertainty.Under its former name, Willow Wealth — backed by prominent venture firms and buoyed by aggressive online marketing — had been the best known of a wave of American startups that promised to broaden access to the alternative investments that are the domain of institutions and rich families.But the still-unfolding collapse of its real estate funds demonstrates the risks the private markets hold for retail investors. By their very nature, private investments don't trade on exchanges and lack standardized disclosures. That leaves investors especially reliant on private fund managers, both for information and to safeguard their interests for years while their money is locked up in deals.Private markets have gained in prominence this year after President Donald Trump signed an executive order to allow the investments in retirement plans.While critics say that opaque, illiquid investments with high management fees aren't appropriate for ordinary investors, asset managers including BlackRock and Apollo Global Management see retail as a vast untapped pool of capital. Retirement giant Empower said in May that it would allow private assets into the 401(k) plans of participating employers with help from firms including Apollo and Goldman Sachs.New mascot, same pitch Against this backdrop, Willow Wealth CEO Mitch Caplan, a former E-Trade chief who took the helm in May, said the company was heading toward a new model. Instead of only offering deals sourced by the startup, it would also sell private market funds from Wall Street giants including Goldman and Carlyle Group.The company no longer provides the historical performance of its offerings because of the pivot to third party-managed funds, according to a person with knowledge of the situation who asked for anonymity to discuss internal strategy.\"Transparency is paramount to us, and we consistently provide strategy-specific performance information for each manager at the offering level to support informed decision making,\" said a Willow Wealth spokeswoman.As for CNBC's reporting on the new real estate defaults and rising tally of losses, the Willow Wealth spokeswoman called it a \"rehash\" of news on \"investments from five years ago.\"\"The investments in question represent a very small portion of our overall portfolio and do not reflect the current nature of our offerings or business focus,\" she said.The firm declined to say how much it manages in assets.The startup — founded in 2015 by Michael Weisz and Milind Mehere, who remain on Willow Wealth's board of directors — told customers that private investments would provide both higher returns and lower volatility than traditional assets.Willow Wealth's pitch hasn't changed much, despite the rebrand.In a new ad campaign, a character called Hampton Dumpty says that he's \"learned a thing or two about crashes\" and therefore uses Willow Wealth to diversify his portfolio with private market assets including real estate.The mascot, a play on the Humpty-Dumpty nursery rhyme, tells viewers that \"portfolios including private markets have outperformed traditional ones for the past 20 years.\"Compounding feesOn its revamped website, the firm has a chart showing a hypothetical portfolio made of private equity, private credit and real estate outperforming traditional stocks and bonds over the decade through 2025.But the chart doesn't include the impact of fees, which are typically far higher for private investments than for stock ETFs and mutual funds. The company also notes in a disclosure that customers can't actually invest in the private market indexes listed.While most stock ETFs carry fees below 0.2%, Willow Wealth typically charges 10 times more than that, or 2% annually on unreturned funds, for its real estate offerings, according to product documents.Willow Wealth also charged an array of one-time fees associated with the creation of the funds, including for structuring the deal and arranging the loans.Fees for Willow Wealth's new products are even higher. The company charges about 1.4% annually for access to portfolios made up of private funds from Goldman Sachs, Carlyle and the StepStone Group, according to its website.Those firms also charge their own fees, leading to all-in annual costs ranging from about 3.3% to 6.7% per fund, according to the providers' documents.That makes Willow Wealth's products among the most expensive in the retail investing universe.'Difficult news'For customers still coming to terms with their losses and who remain in limbo on funds that the firm says are on \"watchlist\" for possible default, Yieldstreet's transformation into Willow Wealth looks like an effort to evade accountability, the customers told CNBC.After last week's disclosures, nine out of the 30 real estate deals reviewed by CNBC since August are now in default. That 30% failure rate is high, even by the standards of the private assets world, said Boston University's Williams.Though the realm of private credit is more opaque, making average default rates difficult to pinpoint, some in the industry estimate typical failure rates of between 2% and 8%.Whether they were apartments in hot downtown areas or established cities, or single-family homes scattered across Southern boomtowns, projects that Willow Wealth put its customers into struggled to hit revenue targets and fell behind on loan payments.Willow Wealth has blamed the failures on the Federal Reserve's interest rate hiking cycle in 2022, which made repaying floating-rate debt harder.Among newly disclosed defaults are a pair of funds tied to a 268-unit luxury apartment building in East Nashville called Stacks on Main.Investors hoping to earn the advertised 16.4% annual return put a combined $18.2 million into the two funds, according to documents reviewed by CNBC. They later added another $2 million in a member loan meant to stabilize the deal.Stacks on Main apartment complex in Nashville, Tenn.Courtesy: Google Maps\"Your equity investment is expected to incur a full loss\" after selling Stacks on Main on Nov. 25, Willow Wealth told customers in a letter dated that same day. Investors in the member loan will lose up to 60%, the company said.\"We understand this is difficult news to receive,\" Willow Wealth told customers. \"We share in your disappointment.\"Documents for the 2022 transactions listed Nazare Capital, the family office of former WeWork CEO Adam Neumann, as the sponsor for the deal. Real estate sponsors typically source, acquire and manage deals on behalf of investors.In 2022, after his WeWork tenure ended, Neumann founded property startup Flow, which took on some of the real estate deals from his family office.In public comments to news outlets over the past year, representatives from Flow have sought to distance the company from the travails of then-Yieldstreet.But according to the 2022 investment memo, Nazare purchased Stacks on Main in July 2021 for $79 million and then offloaded a majority stake to Yieldstreet members through a joint venture.Crucially, the transaction saddled the joint venture with $62.1 million in debt, a burden which would later prove instrumental in the deal's failure, CNBC found. Israeli-American businessman Adam Neumann speaks during The Israeli American Council (IAC) 8th Annual National Summit on January 19, 2023 in Austin, Texas.Shahar Azran | Getty Images\"This building was majority-owned by YieldStreet and the property was never operated either by Flow or anyone associated with Adam,\" a spokeswoman for Neumann told CNBC. \"In any event, the building has been sold and Flow no longer has a minority interest nor any involvement in this property.\" Nazare was also listed as sponsor for another Nashville project that went sideways for retail investors, an apartment complex at 2010 West End Ave. That project resulted in $35 million in losses across two funds, wipeouts that were previously reported by CNBC.Besides the deals tied to Nazare, there were other defaults.A project called the Houston Multi-Family Equity fund, made up of apartments across suburban Texas, resulted in a loss of all $21 million of customer funds, the startup told investors in a Nov. 25 letter. \"The property was unable to generate sufficient revenue to pay monthly debt service and operating expenses\" and went into foreclosure, resulting in a \"full loss of the equity,\" Willow Wealth said.A 'high-risk' trapThe tally of Willow Wealth's investor losses is likely to rise further.For instance, an $11.6 million loan made by Willow Wealth customers for a Portland, Oregon, multifamily project is \"currently in default\" after an appraisal found that the borrower owed more than the real estate was worth, the company told investors.Willow Wealth is trying to restructure the borrower's loan to avoid selling the property for a loss, the company said in a letter to investors.The company has also warned investors that a Tucson, Arizona, apartment complex and two projects made up of single-family rental homes across Southern states were likely to result in future losses of unspecified amounts, according to separate letters. Investors put more than $63 million combined into those deals.Williams, the Boston University professor and a former Federal Reserve bank examiner, said he taught a class this fall on how Willow Wealth and other fintech firms failed to protect their customers.\"They claimed they were going to democratize access to the types of deals only the rich had,\" Williams said. \"In reality, they created a high-risk trap for investors.\"watch now",

    "body": "People hold a sign as they participate in a protest outside the U.S. Supreme Court over President Donald Trump's move to end birthright citizenship as the court hears arguments over the order in Washington, May 15, 2025.Drew Angerer | Afp | Getty ImagesThe Supreme Court on Friday said it will hear arguments in a case that will determine if President Donald Trump can undo automatic citizenship for people born in the United States.Trump, on his first day back in the White House on Jan. 20, issued an executive order that said babies born in the U.S. more than 30 days after that order were not entitled to be issued citizenship documents if their parents were temporary visitors or illegal immigrants.Before Trump's order, there was little dispute that the U.S. Constitution's 14th Amendment, with rare exceptions, meant that children born in the country were automatically U.S. citizens, regardless of their parents' status.The Citizenship Clause in that amendment says, \"All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States.\" The Supreme Court, which is expected to rule next year, will determine if Trump's executive order complies with that amendment.The order told federal agencies to refuse to recognize the citizenship of children born in the U.S. if their mother \"was unlawfully present in the United States and the person's father was not a United States citizen or lawful permanent resident at the time of said person's birth,\" or when the baby's \"mother's presence in the United States was lawful but temporary, and the person's father was not a United States citizen or lawful permanent resident at the time.\"Several federal district court judges have found that Trump's order violated the Constitution, and two federal circuit courts of appeals upheld injunctions blocking the order from taking effect.",

    "body": "Tarek Adieh, of Tampa, Florida, looks at cannabis flower from wholesaler Dep Kings at Champs Trade Show at the Palmer Events Center, Sept. 11, 2025.Jay Jannar | Hearst Newspapers | Getty ImagesPresident Donald Trump is expected to sign an executive order this week that would broadly expand access to cannabis. Industry advocates, executives and researchers who spoke to CNBC said the changes would come with big implications for both consumers and the health care industry. Trump said Monday he's \"strongly\" considering an executive order that would reclassify pot as a Schedule III drug under the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency, which would place cannabis alongside Tylenol with codeine, rather than Schedule I with the likes of heroin and LSD, as it's classified now. The order would also authorize a pilot program allowing Medicare to cover cannabis products for seniors. The proposal is expected to apply specifically to cannabidiol products, better known as CBD, aimed at treating chronic pain, sleep deprivation, and other age-related ailments, said Shawn Hauser, a partner at cannabis-focused law firm Vicente LLP.CBD has spiked in popularity in recent years, moving into the mainstream via canned cocktails and body lotions, but has yet to win full-throated backing from federal drug regulators. \"I expect the executive order will make clear what kind of cannabinoids are covered, that they have to come from a federally legal source,\" Hauser told CNBC. While many in the cannabis industry view the shift to Schedule III as a done deal, the inclusion of a controversial Medicare provision adds an extra wrinkle that could embed cannabis-derived products into the U.S. health-care system, despite limited clinic evidence of their efficacy, some experts told CNBC. Insiders like Hauser expect the final order to define legal cannabinoids, administrative methods and a framework for Food and Drug Administration oversight.\"A lot of people want to see it, the reclassification, because it leads to tremendous amounts of research that can't be done unless you reclassify,\" Trump told reporters Monday. \"So we are looking at that very strongly.\"Rescheduling and Medicare coverage are likely to trigger new investments from institutional capital and investors that typically follow federal insurance coverage to big pharmaceutical companies, said Timothy Seymour, founder and chief investment officer of Seymour Asset Management and a CNBC contributor. \"The valuation of the sector will be worth a lot more because institutional investors will be allowed in, will have access and will have liquidity, and exchanges will trade them,\" Seymour told CNBC. \"That immediately could double or triple the sector.\"The push for reclassification comes as a 2024 report found that more Americans reported using marijuana daily, or near-daily, than reported drinking alcohol at the same frequency. It was the first time the share of daily use had flipped in marijuana's favor, based on analysis of 40 years of data from Carnegie Mellon University.A budtender organizes and inventories marijuana flower at The Health Center, a medical cannabis and recreational marijuana dispensary in Denver.Vince Chandler | Denver Post | Getty ImagesMedicare disagreementsThe Medicare initiative is being championed by billionaire Howard Kessler, a financier and longtime Trump ally who founded The Commonwealth Project in 2019. The organization says it advocates for senior care, including through cannabis use. Kessler and advocates like Hauser have urged the administration to bypass typical FDA hurdles — like yearslong clinical trials — and use a pilot program to gather real-world data on the safety and outcomes of cannabinoids in the senior population.Kessler did not respond to a request for comment. The White House also did not respond to a request for comment. In September, cannabis companies' stocks rallied on optimism that Trump would soon weigh in after he shared a Commonwealth Project video on Truth Social that branded CBD coverage as \"the most important senior health initiative of the century.\"However, the Medicare proposal has drawn scrutiny, even from other Trump allies. House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., has raised concerns about the cost and liability of such a program, the Washington Post first reported, while FDA officials argue that reimbursing Americans for non-agency-approved treatments would be unprecedented.Beyond the politics, the scientific case for medical cannabis remains contentious. Research shiftsThe FDA has so far only approved CBD-based drug Epidiolex to treat rare forms of epilepsy. This narrow approval reflects both regulators' caution and the fact that high-quality clinical trials are still limited for most of the other conditions where cannabis is being promoted.Critics warn that a Medicare pilot program could endanger seniors, a demographic that often takes multiple daily medications. A recent FDA-funded study suggested that prolonged CBD use may cause liver toxicity and interfere with other life-saving medications. \"It's not at all based on science. This is all based on money, and it's egregious. That's not the way we make medical decisions,\" said Meg Haney, director of the Cannabis Research Laboratory at Columbia University. \"[Kessler], who's a buddy with the president ... can make a lot of money selling something that has no evidence behind it.\"Other research has cast doubt on cannabis' efficacy entirely, suggesting it may not be effective for many of the conditions targeted by the proposed pilot, Haney said. For example, a 2023 review of 134 studies involving adults age 50 and older found medical cannabis to have inconsistent outcomes for improving conditions like end-stage cancer and dementia. The review also found more frequent links to harms including depression, anxiety, cognitive impairment and injury.Rescheduling cannabis would, however, ease barriers to conducting clinical trials that experts say have historically stifled scientific research.\"Medical research has effectively been under lock and key,\" said Ryan Vandrey, a Johns Hopkins University professor who helps run its Cannabis Science Lab. \"Schedule I makes large, placebo-controlled trials incredibly difficult. Without that data, policymakers are being asked to make decisions in the dark.\"Investing potentialFor investors, the specific terms of rescheduling are critical. Rescheduling would improve growers' access to banking and financial services because it would lift certain IRS tax restrictions, which bar cannabis businesses from deducting standard expenses. The economic backdrop is already shifting: The annual value of the U.S. cannabis production jumped 40% last year from the previous year, according to the Department of Agriculture. The global market for cannabis-derived products is projected to hit $160 billion global market by 2032, according to Grand View Research.Rumors of rescheduling and a possible pilot program helped shares of weed producers Tilray Brands and Canopy Growth jump 44% and 52%, respectively, on Friday.  As Seymour described it, Medicare coverage and federal insurance involvement is the \"holy grail\" that could unlock institutional capital.A Schedule III classification could also help legitimize the sector for institutional investors who have been hesitant to wade in, paving the way for more stocks to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq and shifting valuations from retail sentiment to fundamental cash flows.\"The Schedule I classification is what has held back a lot of institutional investors,\" Seymour said. \"Having to go out and tell their shareholders ... that they own a company who's selling something that is on a par with heroin, LSD or cocaine ... is kind of a tough thing to swallow.\"Stock Chart IconStock chart iconStocks of largest market cap cannabis companies in the U.S. Business risksIf cannabis shifts to a reimbursable prescription drug model or federal legality, the category could attract interest from major pharmaceutical companies and distribution could eventually migrate from state-licensed dispensaries to national pharmacy chains like CVS and Walgreens. That could spell trouble for smaller weed businesses.Already, large pharmaceutical companies have the deep pockets needed to fund the multi-year, double-blind clinical trials required for FDA-approved drugs — a barrier to entry that few current cannabis operators can surmount.However, Seymour views Medicare coverage as a catalyst for merger and acquisition activity rather than an immediate death knell.\"You are going to see more consolidation in the sector,\" Seymour said. \"Smaller companies that have good businesses, that are profitable ... are probably going to be seen as targets.\"Meanwhile, Green Thumb Industries CEO Ben Kovler foresees more competition among pharmaceutical companies and cannabis companies to achieve medical breakthroughs.\"The pharma sector, in the past, has been a major lobbyist against [cannabis] because it is a threat,\" Seymour added. \"Therefore, yes, it's a huge opportunity for pharma.\"— CNBC's Brandon Gomez contributed to this report.

    "body": "Susie Wiles, White House chief of staff, in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington, June 27, 2025.Yuri Gripas | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesPresident Donald Trump on Tuesday defended White House chief of staff, Susie Wiles, after she told a reporter that Trump has an \"alcoholic's personality.\"Trump, in an interview with the New York Post, said he stood by Wiles after Vanity Fair published her surprisingly candid — and occasionally critical — remarks about the administration from a series of interviews this year.\"Oh, she's fantastic,\" Trump said.Wiles, a spotlight-averse figure who enjoys unparalleled influence and power in Trump's orbit, offered blunt descriptions of many of the administration's highest-profile officials over 11 interviews with Vanity Fair's Chris Whipple.Wiles — the daughter of New York Giants kicker Pat Summerall, who is described by Vanity Fair as an alcoholic and an absentee parent — told Whipple her difficult upbringing made her \"a little bit of an expert in big personalities.\"Trump does not drink, but he has \"an alcoholic's personality\" in that he \"operates [with] a view that there's nothing he can't do,\" Wiles said. \"Nothing, zero, nothing.\" In his interview with the Post, Trump said Wiles \"meant that I'm — you see, I don't drink alcohol. So everybody knows that — but I've often said that if I did, I'd have a very good chance of being an alcoholic.\"\"I have said that many times about myself, I do. It's a very possessive personality,\" Trump said.\"I've said that many times about myself. I'm fortunate I'm not a drinker. If I did, I could very well, because I've said that — what's the word? Not possessive — possessive and addictive type personality,\" the president said. \"Oh, I've said it many times, many times before.\"Trump also attacked Vanity Fair, saying, \"I think from what I hear, the facts were wrong, and it was a very misguided interviewer, purposely misguided.\"Wiles, and much of Trump's Cabinet, had already pushed back on the Vanity Fair articles.In an X post, Wiles called them \"a disingenuously framed hit piece on me and the finest President, White House staff, and Cabinet in history.\"\"Significant context was disregarded and much of what I, and others, said about the team and the President was left out of the story. I assume, after reading it, that this was done to paint an overwhelmingly chaotic and negative narrative about the President and our team,\" she wrote. She added that she has been \"honored\" to work for Trump for nearly a decade, and declared, \"None of this will stop our relentless pursuit of Making America Great Again!\"White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt, in a statement to CNBC, added that Wiles \"has helped President Trump achieve the most successful first 11 months in office of any president in American history.\" \"President Trump has no greater or more loyal advisor than Susie. The entire administration is grateful for her steady leadership and united fully behind her,\" Leavitt said.What Wiles told WhippleWiles told Vanity Fair that Trump has engaged in legal \"retribution\" against his enemies since his return to office.Wiles said in March that she and Trump had a \"loose agreement that the score settling will end before the first 90 days are over.\"Around five months later, she initially denied that Trump was \"on a retribution tour,\" contending that he was motivated by getting \"people that have done bad things\" out of the government.But she admitted, \"In some cases, it may look like retribution. And there may be an element of that from time to time.\"And she said that the administration's attempted prosecution of New York Attorney General Letitia James — who helmed a business fraud case against Trump and was seen as one of his most reviled political foes — \"might be the one retribution.\"The case against James on mortgage fraud-related charges was dismissed in November, after a judge ruled Trump's pick of prosecutor was invalidly appointed. The Department of Justice has so far failed to convince subsequent grand juries to reindict her.She also spoke about the behind-the-scenes maneuvering behind some of Trump's biggest agenda items, including his global \"reciprocal\" tariff policy.The early April tariff rollout, which Trump touted as America's \"Liberation Day,\" was the product of what Wiles described as a divided White House that could not agree on the policy's impact.\"So much thinking out loud is what I would call it,\" Wiles said in an interview at the time, recalling that she urged advisers who doubted the tariff plans to get on board, but \"they couldn't get there.\"Wiles said she believed a middle ground on tariffs would ultimately succeed, Whipple reported. \"But it's been more painful than I expected,\" she said.Read more CNBC politics coverageTrump sues BBC for $10 billion, claims defamation from Panorama documentaryPentagon takes big stake in new Korea Zinc refinery in Tenn., gets 10% of companyNew Trump tariffs collection hits $200 billion, Customs saysFormer Instacart employee says she was fired over her Democratic congressional campaignUkraine peace talks progressing, Russia open to EU membership, U.S. officials sayNew York AG sues UPS for allegedly shorting Christmas season workers' wagesTrump admin to hire 1,000 specialists for 'Tech Force'Trump doubles down on Rob Reiner criticism after killing; director's son in custodyTSA is giving airline passenger data to ICE for deportation push: NYTTrump's AI order may be 'illegal,' Democrats and consumer advocacy groups claimTrump sued by preservation group seeking to halt White House ballroom projectTrump says 'no big deal' after new Epstein photos showing him releasedPutin can fund war for years, ex-official says as Trump's resolve is testedIndiana redistricting bill that Trump demanded defeated in state SenateHouse passes INVEST Act to ease investment standards, boost capital in marketsDOJ fails again to indict New York AG James, a Trump target: ReportsTrump 'sells out' U.S. national security with Nvidia chip sales to China: WarrenTrump pushes for top prosecutor nominee Halligan after Comey, James cases tossedTrump willing to seize more oil tankers off Venezuela coast: White HouseSeized tanker will go to U.S. port, Trump admin intends 'to seize the oil'GOP lawmakers seek Trump aid for agricultural equipment after tariff pressureTrump says Fed could have 'at least doubled' latest interest rate cut'Spoof' ship: Seized oil tanker hid location, visited Iran and VenezuelaTrump admin touts pulling 9,500 truckers off road for failing English testsSwiss government says new 15% U.S. tariff ceiling retroactive to mid-NovemberHomeland Security Dept. buying Boeing 737s for ICE deportationsTrump officials move to end student loan payment pause for millions of borrowersJudge unseals Ghislaine Maxwell grand jury materials, citing Epstein files actUkraine at 'critical moment' in war as European allies ramp up pressure on RussiaDemocrats establish AI working group as industry bolsters DC presenceEx-Trump lawyer Habba resigns as NJ U.S. attorney after disqualificationWhipple also reported Wiles saying that Vice President JD Vance, a onetime Trump critic who became a leading figure of the MAGA movement, had \"sort of political\" motivations for changing his views. He has been \"a conspiracy theorist for a decade,\" she added.Vance, asked about the comments later Tuesday, said he only believes \"in the conspiracy theories that are true.\" He listed his concerns about putting masks on children during the Covid-19 pandemic and about former President Joe Biden's health during his time in office as examples.\"If any of us have learned a lesson from that Vanity Fair article, I hope that the lesson is we should be giving fewer interviews to mainstream media outlets,\" Vance added.Wiles said Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought, an author of the government-reform  guidebook known as Project 2025, was \"a right-wing absolute zealot.\"Attorney General Pam Bondi, meanwhile, \"completely whiffed\" on her early handling of government records related to notorious sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, Wiles said.Trump said on the 2024 campaign trail that he would support declassifying files from the federal investigations of Epstein, a well-connected money manager who died in jail in 2019 while facing sex trafficking charges. But the Trump administration later said it determined that no more disclosures were warranted, sparking outrage from many MAGA supporters.Bondi, who in February gave binders with old information labeled \"The Epstein Files: Phase 1\" to a group of conservative influencers, failed to appreciate that those people were \"the very targeted group that cared about this,\" Wiles said.\"First she gave them binders full of nothingness. And then she said that the witness list, or the client list, was on her desk,\" Wiles said, adding, \"There is no client list, and it sure as hell wasn't on her desk.\" As for Elon Musk, the Tesla and SpaceX chief who briefly ran Trump's controversial government-slashing group known as DOGE, Wiles accused him of being \"an avowed ketamine [user]\" and \"an odd, odd duck, as I think geniuses are.\"She said that she \"was initially aghast\" when DOGE moved to dismantle the United States Agency for International Development, which Musk has claimed was rife with fraud.\"I think anybody that pays attention to government and has ever paid attention to USAID believed, as I did, that they do very good work,\" she said.\"Elon's attitude is you have to get it done fast. If you're an incrementalist, you just won't get your rocket to the moon,\" Wiles said. \"And so with that attitude, you're going to break some china. But no rational person could think the USAID process was a good one. Nobody.\"",

In Roslansky's view, having a five-year plan is \"a little bit foolish,\" he said: given how rapidly technology and the workplace are changing, it's not realistic to \"chart out what the next five years of your life are going to look like.\"Instead, Roslansky advised workers to focus on what they want to learn and what experiences they want to have.\"I think that's the right mental model in this environment,\" he said. \"If you focus on those shorter steps, gaining learning, gaining experience, a lot of your career path will open up for you.\"According to Roslansky, having a linear career path isn't realistic anymore. Many people think \"you graduate high school and then go to a certain college and then become a consultant and then get an MBA,\" he said – but \"that's not how it happens at all for most people.\"Once you let go of that idea, \"you can take your own career into your own hands,\" he said. \"No one is trying to figure this out for you. You have to take care of it yourself.\"His advice for young professionalsRoslansky also shared his best advice for young people navigating their careers right now.His first tip is to \"learn the tools\" and experiment with using AI at work, he told McGoff.\"Try and figure out how to create a PowerPoint presentation out of chat,\" he said. \"You know, figure out how this can help you with a better marketing message.\"\"Whether or not you like it, whether or not it's a good fit for what you're trying to do, that mental model – like, 'I'm going to use this tool and learn it to help me do something' – I think is the most important thing,\" he continued.Still, \"it's not just about the tools and technology,\" Roslansky said: skills like empathy, judgment and communication are still \"critical\" in the modern workplace.\"In a world where everyone is kind of, you know, focused more on the technology, if you really work on a lot of those human skills, it can be a great differentiator for you,\" he said.Want to give your kids the ultimate advantage?

    "body": "A job seeker speaks with a recruiter at the KeySource booth at the Mega JobNewsUSA South Florida Job Fair held in the Amerant Bank Arena in Sunrise, Florida, on April 30, 2025.Joe Raedle | Getty ImagesNonfarm payrolls grew slightly more than expected in November but slumped in October while unemployment hit its highest in four years, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported Tuesday in numbers delayed by the government shutdown.Job growth totaled a seasonally adjusted 64,000 for the month, better than the Dow Jones estimate of 45,000 and up from a sharp decline in October.The unemployment rate rose to 4.6%, more than expected and its highest level since September 2021. A more encompassing measure that includes discouraged workers and those holding part-time jobs for economic reasons swelled to 8.7%, its peak going back to August 2021.In addition to the November report, the BLS released an abbreviated October count that showed payrolls down 105,000. While there was no official estimate, Wall Street economists were largely expecting a decline following a surprise increase of 108,000 in September. The October slump came from a steep fall in government employment as deferred layoffs instituted earlier this year took effect. Government payrolls were off 162,000 for the month, and fell an additional 6,000 in November.The October decline marked the third time in six months that payrolls saw a net negative level. The BLS report also showed that August's numbers were revised down 22,000 to show a steeper loss of 26,000, while September's initial count was pushed lower by 11,000.The BLS had cautioned that the household survey, which is used to calculate the unemployment rate, will be affected for several months by impacts of the shutdown. Challenges in capturing the October numbers led to the cancellation of both the jobs report and the closely watched consumer price index.Despite the complications, the report painted a familiar picture of the labor market. The jobs climate continues to be one of low hiring and low firing, affected as well by stringent border practices under President Donald Trump that have drained the workforce of the usual influx of immigrants. The establishment numbers showed most of the gains in November came from a familiar source — health care added 46,000 jobs, accounting for more than 70% of the total net increase. Construction rose by 28,000, while social assistance contributed 18,000.On the down side, transportation and warehousing was off 18,000, part of a continuing trend in job losses for the sector. Leisure and hospitality also posted a loss of 12,000. \"The U.S. economy is in a jobs recession,\" said Heather Long, chief economist at Navy Federal Credit Union. \"The nation has added a mere 100,000 in the past six months. The bulk of those jobs were in healthcare, an industry that is almost always hiring due to America's aging population.\"However, the White House put a positive spin on the report.\"The strong jobs report shows how President Trump is fixing the damage caused by Joe Biden and creating a strong, America First economy in record time,\" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement. \"Workers' wages are rising, prices are falling, trillions of dollars in investments are pouring into our country, and the American economy is primed to boom in 2026.\"From a policy perspective, the Federal Reserve has had to work a difficult line between trying to head off further weakness in the labor market and guarding against making stubbornly high inflation worse.At its most recent meeting, the central bank lowered its key interest rate by a quarter percentage point but signaled that the bar is higher for additional cuts. The Fed has approved three consecutive reductions since September, taking its benchmark funds rate down to a target range of 3.5%-3.75%.\"The Fed is unlikely to put much weight on today's report given data disruptions,\" said Kay Haigh, global co-head of fixed income and liquidity solutions at Goldman Sachs Asset Management. \"The report on December's employment data, released in early January ahead of the next meeting, will likely be a much more meaningful indicator for the Fed when it comes to deciding the near-term policy trajectory.\"Markets continued to put low odds on another rate cut in January. The probability was around 24.4% following the jobs report, unchanged from Monday, according to the CME Group's FedWatch.Fed officials have maintained that the labor market is not a source of inflation, and Tuesday's jobs report backed up that assertion.Average hourly earnings rose just 0.1% for the month, below the estimate for 0.3%, and were up 3.5% from a year ago, the smallest annual gain since May 2021.The 0.1 percentage point increase in the unemployment rate was largely a function of labor force growth.Over the two-month period, household employment actually increased by 407,000. However, that was offset partially by a rise of 323,000 in the labor force as the participation rate edged higher to 62.5%.In other economic news Tuesday, the Commerce Department reported that retail sales were flat in September, against a forecast for a 0.1% increase, according to numbers adjusted for seasonality but not inflation. Excluding autos, however, sales increased 0.4%, better than the 0.2% estimate.",

    "body": "Paul Putnam, 53, a rancher and independent contract pumper walks past a pump jack in Loving County, Texas, November 25, 2019.Angus Mordant | ReutersU.S. crude oil prices fell nearly 3% on Tuesday to close at the lowest level since early 2021, as a looming surplus and possible peace agreement in Ukraine weigh on the market.  West Texas Intermediate fell 2.73%, or $1.55, to close at $55.27 per barrel, the lowest since February 2021 during the Covid-19 pandemic. Global benchmark Brent lost 2.71%, or $1.64, to settle at $58.92. U.S. crude has shed about 23% this year in its worst performance since 2018, while Brent is down about 21% for its worst year since 2020.U.S. gasoline prices have fallen below $3 per gallon to the lowest level in four years in a boost to consumers ahead of the holidays, according to the drivers' association AAA. Falling oil prices could signal a slowing economy. U.S. job growth totalled 64,000 in November but declined by 105,000 in October. The unemployment rate hit a four-year high of 4.6%.The oil market is under pressure this year as OPEC+ members have rapidly ramped up production after years of output cuts. Investors are also pricing in the possibility of lower geopolitical risk as President Donald Trump pressures Ukraine to accept a peace agreement with Russia. The threat of supply disruptions has loomed over the oil market since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Kyiv has launched repeated drone strikes on Russian oil infrastructure this year. The U.S. and its European allies, meanwhile, have targeted Russia's crude industry with sanctions. Ukraine's attacks on oil infrastructure and U.S. sanctions on Russian oil companies would likely be lifted relatively quickly in the event of an agreement, said Jorge Leon, Rystad Energy's head of geopolitical analysis, in a note to clients. \"This would significantly reduce the risk of near-term Russian supply disruptions and allow a sizeable volume of Russian oil currently stored on water to return to the market,\" Leon said. Russian oil stored on water is currently estimated at around 170 million barrels, according to Rystad.The end of U.S. sanctions on Russia would also change the incentives for OPEC+, Leon said. The group would likely resume a strategy to retake market share through higher production after recently pressing pause on that approach, he said. ",

    "body": "Amazon gift cards are offered for sale at a Walgreens store on December 03, 2025 in Chicago, Illinois. Scott Olson | Getty ImagesSlope, a lending startup that uses artificial intelligence to vet businesses, is partnering with Amazon starting Tuesday to provide a reusable line of credit to Amazon sellers, backed by a JPMorgan Chase credit facility, the company told CNBC exclusively. The new relationship means eligible U.S. Amazon vendors can apply for and access capital directly through their Amazon Seller accounts with real-time approvals. Slope was co-founded by CEO Lawrence Lin Murata, who said said he saw the ups and downs of running a small business while he was growing up in São Paulo.Lin Murata helped his parents at their family's toy shop, which they've been running for more than three decades. As he gained more insight into the finances of the business, he said he realized that cash flow was a large pain point for his parents and other small businesses. That led him to start Slope, an AI-powered lending platform backed by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and JPMorgan Chase, with co-founder Alice Deng.\"Leveraging AI, we're able to underwrite these businesses, and we're able to handle all the complexity of assessing the risk for a business,\" Lin Murata said. \"At the same time, [we're] providing a very easy, real-time experience to them.\"The lines of credit will start at an 8.99% APR, according to Slope, and require  vendors to be in business for at least one year with more than $100,000 in annual revenue. Once approved, Amazon sellers can draw from the line as needed and choose a term ranging from three months to a year to align repayment with their inventory cycle. Slope did not disclose the financial aspects of its deal with Amazon.\"Most people don't realize that sellers, independent sellers, are kind of the backbone of Amazon and e-commerce in general,\" Deng told CNBC. \"More than 60% of Amazon's sales are driven by independent sellers.\"Deng said Slope is filling a gap with the new partnership. Currently, Amazon sellers can use some third parties to access capital, though Deng said those initiatives are more focused on smaller sellers, while Slope is focused on mature sellers, some of whom reach hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue and require bank-grade financing. Deng said when Amazon did its own lending around four years ago, the total addressable market was between $1 billion and $2 billion. With Slope taking over the program, the company expects that number to grow. \"We're excited about our work with Slope, which expands the financing tools available to Amazon selling partners,\" an Amazon spokesperson told CNBC. \"Whether they are just starting out or looking to grow, access to sufficient capital is a critical need for small business owners, and we're always evaluating new ways to empower sellers to thrive in the Amazon store.\"With Slope's new deal, sellers can take a few minutes directly on Amazon Seller Central to apply for capital and get approved almost instantly, using proprietary Amazon performance data and Slope's in-house large language model, Lin Murata said.\"That is one of the reasons why we're able to give a more compelling offer than if you were outside of the Amazon dashboard,\" Lin Murata said. \"And then we give real-time decisions, so we analyze Amazon performance, data, and cash flow in real time.\"It's a process that the Slope co-founders said is easier, faster and more integrated than having to apply for loans at banks as a small business. With the granular data that Amazon provides, like a breakdown of sales by product, they said the AI model is able to make a more informed decision on financing than a bank would based on overall financial documents.With the new deal, Amazon joins a growing slate of Slope's customers, which already include Samsung, Alibaba, Ikea and more. Deng and Lin Murata said the company has trialed the new Amazon integration, and though the trial has been live for just a few weeks, the pair said it's seen significant demand and applications growing 300% week over week.\"Going back to the initial inspiration of my parents, I think we want to be the credit intelligence layer for these businesses,\" Lin Murata said. \"Ultimately, what we're really doing is helping these businesses grow by giving them fair, affordable, fast and very easy access to different forms of financing.\"",

    "body": "Brian Glaser became a first-time manager about 20 years ago when he says he was promoted \"overnight\" into a leadership position at JetBlue.He had a lot to learn as a boss and now, two decades later, is the chief learning officer at Google, where he oversees teams in charge of onboarding and training for some 150,000 employees worldwide.One of the biggest lessons he learned while moving from an individual contributor to overseeing others' work was \"trusting others to get the work done,\" Glaser tells CNBC Make It.\"I remember so much of what gave me fulfillment was getting the job done right, really tackling the project, meeting the deadline, and knowing that I was single-handedly able to contribute to the goal,\" he says.Becoming a manager, though, he had to realize it wasn't about doing the work and getting credit for it. Rather, \"it's about getting work done effectively through others, which means you have to really understand their styles or motivations and work to bring out the best so that they can really deliver excellent outcomes.\"He heard it put once that as an individual contributor, you're trying to make lightning strike; as a manager, you have to create the conditions for lightning to strike.Google chief's 3 secrets to good leadershipGlaser says he's constantly working on the balancing act of setting long-term goals for his teams and charting the paths to achieve them.He's learned from his past mistakes: \"I think where I've messed up over the years [is] I've indexed more on the vision and the future\" rather than being concrete in the smaller steps and benchmarks to get there. Without that path, \"It's very easy for the team to burn out.\"Glaser says bosses should keep three pillars in mind as they lead their teams:Set a direction rather than a destination. The time of spending years on building a long-term strategy is \"over,\" Glaser says. He advises pointing teams in a direction and encouraging them to be agile and pivot when challenges arise, even if that means landing in a slightly different place than originally planned, rather than focusing solely on one potential outcome.Be willing to be wrong. Glaser says this mindset is crucial to be innovative and try things for the first time; it's also important to be able to course-correct when things aren't working out as planned. As leaders, \"we have to move from being a know-it-all to being more of a learn-it-all, which means we have to ask better questions,\" Glaser says. \"We have to be willing to take multiple perspectives and admit to people when we don't know the answer.\"Pay attention to the human side of change. AI is impacting businesses faster than ever, and Glaser says a good leader will pay attention to how those changes influence their teams socially, emotionally and cognitively. It comes down to leading with empathy, he says: \"How do we really help meet them where they are, so that we can come through whatever it is that we're going through as a team together?\"His best advice for a first-time managerFor anyone else leading a team for the first time, Glaser says \"the most important thing\" is to focus on building connections with your reports to understand \"the experiences, the interests, the aspirations of your people.\"Doing so builds trust, he says, which is a foundational part of what makes a high-performing team and helps them move through challenges and ultimately succeed.\"If nothing else,\" Glaser says, \"really invest time in getting to know your people, building those relationships, and all else will follow.\"Want to give your kids the ultimate advantage? You teach them to read and ride a bike, but often skip money management.

    "body": "Barry Biffle, president and CEO of Frontier Airlines, prior to a Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Antitrust, Competition Policy and Consumer Rights hearing in Washington, Sept. 30, 2025.Kent Nishimura | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesFrontier Group Holdings, the parent company of budget airline Frontier, replaced its nearly decade-long CEO, Barry Biffle, with the carrier's president, the company said Monday.James Dempsey took over as interim CEO, effective immediately.\"Jimmy has been an invaluable member of Frontier's senior leadership team for more than 10 years and has played an instrumental role in the company's evolution and growth during that time,\" Board Chair Bill Franke, a longtime budget airline investor and executive, said in a news release. \"We believe Jimmy is uniquely qualified to guide our airline into the future.\" Biffle and Frontier declined to comment. Frontier said Biffle would stay on in an \"advisory capacity\" until the end of the year. Frontier's shares were down 11% in morning trading on Tuesday after the announcement.Biffle had been Frontier's chief executive since March 2016 and has a more than three-decade career in airlines, including at the country's longtime top budget carrier, Spirit, which is currently in its second bankruptcy in less than a year.Frontier lost $190 million in the first nine months of the year, compared with net income of $31 million a year earlier.Frontier had been in talks to merge with Spirit several times since early 2022, but none have solidified thus far. Spirit won another lifeline on Monday, saying it amended its debtor-in-possession credit agreement to get access to $100 million in funding, with $50 million available immediately. The rest will be accessible through previously agreed upon terms tied to its progress of a standalone reorganization plan or a \"strategic transaction,\" Spirit said, adding that it's in negotiations for both possibilities.watch nowSmaller budget airlines like Frontier have struggled to produce steady profits in the wake of the pandemic, as higher labor and other costs, consumer tastes shifting to international travel and higher-end seats, and an oversupply of domestic capacity have hurt financial results.Biffle led some of Frontier's initiatives in recent months to cater to customers seeking more space on board. Frontier's shares are down nearly 19% so far this year, while the NYSE Arca Airline Index, which tracks mostly U.S. airlines, is up more than 6%.",

That will be followed by $5.5 billion in cash to be charged through 2027, and the majority of that chunk will be paid next year, Ford said.The charges will impact the automaker's net results but not its adjusted earnings. The automaker said Monday it was increasing its guidance of adjusted earnings before interest and taxes to about $7 billion in 2025. That's in line with a target from earlier this year, before the company lowered expectations to between $6 billion and $6.5 billion in adjusted EBIT in October.The charges announced Monday, including $8.5 billion in write-downs of EV assets, are connected to major changes to Ford's business plans. The new plans include refocusing investments on hybrid vehicles, including plug-in models rather than pure EVs; canceling a next generation of large all-electric trucks in exchange for smaller, more affordable EVs; and a rebalancing of its investments in core products such as trucks and SUVs.The changes are the latest under Ford CEO Jim Farley and his \"Ford+\" restructuring plan that has taken on many different forms since he initially announced it as an EV growth plan in 2021. \"We evaluated the market, and we made the call,\" Farley told CNBC's \"Closing Bell Overtime\" on Monday. \"We're following customers to where the market is, not where people thought it was going to be, but where it is today.\"Stock Chart IconStock chart iconFord, GM and Stellantis stocks.The EV segment has experienced a sales slump domestically after the Trump administration put an early end in September to a $7,500 federal tax credit previously available for EV buyers in the U.S. Farley said on CNBC that policy \"wasn't the only reason why we made this choice,\" but he acknowledged it did play a role. Ford also said Monday that its all-electric F-150 Lightning pickup will transition to an extended-range EV, or EREV, that includes an electric powertrain as well as a gas-powered generator, and it announced plans to use battery plants in Kentucky and Michigan for a new stationary energy storage business.\"The last couple of months have been really clear to us,\" Farley told CNBC's Phil LeBeau. \"The very high-end EVs — the $50,000, $70,000, $80,000 vehicles — they just weren't selling.\"Ford said the changes are expected to provide \"a path to profitability\" for its Model e electric vehicle business by 2029, targeting annual improvements beginning in 2026. The automaker also said it expects the changes to improve profits in its traditional Ford Blue unit and Ford Pro commercial and fleet business \"over time with early signs of benefits in 2026.\"The automaker said it expects approximately 50% of its global volume by 2030 will be hybrids, EREVs and fully electric vehicles, up from 17% in 2025.\"These are big decisions that we believe will pay off for years to come for our customers, our employees, American jobs and manufacturing,\" Andrew Frick, president of the Model e and Blue businesses, said Monday during a media call. \"Ford is following the customer. We are looking at the market as it is today, not just as everyone predicted it to be five years ago.\"Ford said it will concentrate its North American electric vehicle development on its new, low-cost, flexible Universal EV Platform that's expected to underpin a \"high-volume family of smaller, highly efficient and affordable electric vehicles.\"The first vehicle from the new platform will be a \"fully connected midsize pickup truck\" assembled at the company's Louisville Assembly Plant starting in 2027.The company also expects its new storage business to be producing and shipping units by 2027 for things such as \"data centers, the electric gird and much more,\" Frick said.\"This is a compelling opportunity. It's a market with huge potential and strong demand,\" he said. \"We will have 20 gigawatt hours of annual capacity for this market.\"Ford stock rose about 2% in after-hours trading Monday.Shares of Ford closed Monday at $13.65, down less than 1%. Ford stock as of Monday's close was up nearly 40% this year.",

    "body": "The House of Representatives on Tuesday voted to advance legislation favored by Big Tech heavy hitters such as OpenAI, Meta, and Microsoft to reform the process for obtaining federal permits for projects to build out artificial intelligence infrastructure in the United States.Backers of the bill, the SPEED Act, argue it is key to helping the U.S. beat out China and other global competitors for leadership in AI. The bill cleared a crucial procedural vote 215-209 on Tuesday in the House. A final vote by the House on the bill could take place later this week.\"For companies like OpenAI that are investing in data centers, networking, and supporting infrastructure across the United States, a more efficient and predictable permitting process is essential,\" Chan Park, head of OpenAI's U.S. and Canada policy and partnerships, wrote in a letter supporting the bill.  The SPEED Act would blunt the 1969 National Environmental Policy Act, which mandates federal reviews for projects that could affect the environment before permits are issued. Efforts over the years to reform NEPA have been thwarted by Democrats who have sided with environmental advocates against Republican lawmakers aligned with business interests.OpenAI CEO Sam Altman attends an event to pitch AI for businesses in Tokyo, Japan February 3, 2025. Kim Kyung-hoon | ReutersBut recently, as AI has been seen as an increasingly important sector, support has grown among Democrats for easing the permitting process. And pressure has increased on Congress as China laps the U.S. in building out AI infrastructure, and as energy-hungry AI data centers stress an aging electric grid. \"We've made it entirely too difficult to build big things in this country, and if we do not reform that, that will be a powerful gift that we are giving to China,\" said Rep. Dusty Johnson, R-S.D., a member of the House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party, in an interview with CNBC.\"Absent a meaningful reform of NEPA, it's going to be difficult for us to get where we need to go,\" Johnson said. In a sign of bipartisan support for reform efforts, the SPEED Act was co-sponsored by House Natural Resources Committee Chair Bruce Westerman, R-Ark., and Rep. Jared Golden, a Maine Democrat.The Data Center Coalition, a group representing major tech companies that are building data centers, said that \"comprehensive permitting reform is a must-have to win the AI race, grow the U.S. economy and secure America's continued global leadership.\"\"Unfortunately, transmission and generation constraints across the country are restricting economic growth, including the development of the U.S. data center industry,\" said Cy McNeill, the group's director of federal affairs.McNeill said that industry \"is seeking to continue investing hundreds of billions of dollars in the U.S. annually to build America's digital infrastructure.\"The SPEED Act would tighten the timelines for federal agencies to conduct reviews under NEPA and limit the law's ability to hamstring a project. The bill also shrinks the current six-year statute of limitations for challenging a permit decision to 150 days. That reform, proponents say, will reduce the number of lawsuits that can stall projects for years. \"Anybody that wants to stop something under NEPA has an upper hand,\" Westerman, the bill's co-sponsor, said in an interview. \"Data centers use a lot of energy, and we've got to build more energy infrastructure, more energy generating capacity, and the hurdle to doing that is getting these projects permitted,\" Westerman said.He warned that data centers could get mired in NEPA litigation if they receive federal funding, such as money from the CHIPS and Science Act for semiconductor production projects.The semiconductor giant Micron, in a letter, said that the SPEED Act would \"accelerate the implementation of economic development investments, such as those by Micron, and would ensure every federal dollar is used efficiently and effectively.\"Despite bipartisan agreement on the need for reforming the permit process, the SPEED Act is running into hurdles on Capitol Hill.The ultra-conservative House Republican Freedom Caucus opposes an amendment that Golden added to the bill, which would limit a president's ability to revoke permits for energy projects that he does not like. President Donald Trump this year has done just that with offshore wind permits. Freedom Caucus Chair Andy Harris, R-Md., threatened to tank the bill before it reaches the floor of the House if Golden's amendment remains in the bill.\"The Golden amendment has to be taken out, and that's a minimum,\" Harris said. \"If that's in there, that rule is not going to succeed.\" It is unclear if enough Democrats will back the SPEED Act to cancel out the effect of any opposition to it from the Freedom Caucus's members.Republicans hold a very slim majority in the House, and the party's leadership can only afford to lose three votes, at most, from the GOP caucus to pass legislation without Democratic support.Read more CNBC politics coverageTrump sues BBC for $10 billion, claims defamation from Panorama documentaryPentagon takes big stake in new Korea Zinc refinery in Tenn., gets 10% of companyNew Trump tariffs collection hits $200 billion, Customs saysFormer Instacart employee says she was fired over her Democratic congressional campaignUkraine peace talks progressing, Russia open to EU membership, U.S. officials sayNew York AG sues UPS for allegedly shorting Christmas season workers' wagesTrump admin to hire 1,000 specialists for 'Tech Force'Trump doubles down on Rob Reiner criticism after killing; director's son in custodyTSA is giving airline passenger data to ICE for deportation push: NYTTrump's AI order may be 'illegal,' Democrats and consumer advocacy groups claimTrump sued by preservation group seeking to halt White House ballroom projectTrump says 'no big deal' after new Epstein photos showing him releasedPutin can fund war for years, ex-official says as Trump's resolve is testedIndiana redistricting bill that Trump demanded defeated in state SenateHouse passes INVEST Act to ease investment standards, boost capital in marketsDOJ fails again to indict New York AG James, a Trump target: ReportsTrump 'sells out' U.S. national security with Nvidia chip sales to China: WarrenTrump pushes for top prosecutor nominee Halligan after Comey, James cases tossedTrump willing to seize more oil tankers off Venezuela coast: White HouseSeized tanker will go to U.S. port, Trump admin intends 'to seize the oil'GOP lawmakers seek Trump aid for agricultural equipment after tariff pressureTrump says Fed could have 'at least doubled' latest interest rate cut'Spoof' ship: Seized oil tanker hid location, visited Iran and VenezuelaTrump admin touts pulling 9,500 truckers off road for failing English testsSwiss government says new 15% U.S. tariff ceiling retroactive to mid-NovemberHomeland Security Dept. buying Boeing 737s for ICE deportationsTrump officials move to end student loan payment pause for millions of borrowersJudge unseals Ghislaine Maxwell grand jury materials, citing Epstein files actUkraine at 'critical moment' in war as European allies ramp up pressure on RussiaDemocrats establish AI working group as industry bolsters DC presenceEx-Trump lawyer Habba resigns as NJ U.S. attorney after disqualificationAt the same time, some Democrats in the House want further concessions than Golden's amendment to ensure that clean energy projects cancelled by Trump will resume.\"I imagine there will be, as there were in committee, a handful of Democrats who are willing to vote for it in its current version, but certainly not a critical mass,\" said Rep. Seth Magaziner, D-R.I.\"Almost every Democrat that's open to permitting reform is going to need some assurances that clean energy is gonna be a part of it,\" said Magaziner, who has signalled interest in reforming the permitting process.Other Democrats think the bill goes too far in undercutting the environment.\"This is standard fare, fossil fuel industry wish list stuff,\" said House Natural Resources Committee Rep. Jared Huffman of California, that panel's top Democrat.Even if the House passes the bill, it will be just the first piece of a planned larger package to reform additional parts of the complex federal permitting apparatus. Lawmakers are eyeing the removal of hurdles to building out interstate energy transmission projects.The Senate has yet to present its own bill for permitting reform, although there are discussions behind closed doors about such a measure.Democrats will have more leverage in the Senate on such legislation because a permitting reform bill will need 60 votes to break the filibuster. There are only 53 Republican senators.\"I think both our teams are figuring out, you know, what's important to the two different caucuses on the committee, and, you know, I hope to be trading paper with Chairman [Mike] Lee very soon,\" Sen. Martin Heinrich, a New Mexico Democrat, said at a recent Semafor event. Lee, R-Utah, is chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, where Heinrich is the ranking member.— CNBC's Emily Wilkins contributed to this report.",

Meta said Tuesday that the company will begin testing its Instagram for TV app in the U.S. via Amazon Fire TV streaming devices, underscoring the photo-sharing app's effort to become a major video platform beyond smartphones, taking on TikTok and YouTube. The Instagram for TV app features the company's TikTok-like Reels videos that are often produced by individual creators to be viewed, shared and algorithmically recommended to users on the platform.Tessa Lyons, Instagram vice president of product, told CNBC in an interview that Meta plans to expand the new TV app to other device makers, though she didn't name them. She said the company is currently prioritizing \"a great experience\" rather than the immediate expansion of its giant ad business on TV.\"We think we probably have a lot more work to do to really make sure that we're bringing people the content they love on mobile in a way that really makes sense for them and feels designed for TV,\" Lyons said. \"That's where we're going to be focused in 2026 as well as bringing it to more people and more devices, and, down the line, we'll certainly think more about monetization.\"Read more CNBC tech newsRobotaxis have had a breakout year: Here's where you can ride in 2026The AI-fueled chip shortage could raise smartphone prices — new research spells out by how muchMerriam-Webster declares 'slop' its word of the year in nod to growth of AIPayPal applies to form bank that can offer small business loans and savings accountsThe Reels displayed on the TV app \"will still continue to be vertical videos\" instead of being reformatted to accommodate a television's more horizontal design, Lyons said.Lyons said the new Instagram TV app will stick with short form, showing Reels videos \"that are three minutes or less.\" Meta previously debuted a separate, video-specific variant of Instagram, dubbed IGTV, in 2018 that let people upload long-form videos. The company shut the mobile app down in 2022, when it began heavily pushing Reels as TikTok's popularity soared.\"Down the line, we'll think about if we want to move into slightly longer content,\" Lyons said.App users will be able to see a selection of Reels that have been collected into channels that are based on specific interests like sports, music, travel and other topics.Customers can add five individual Instagram accounts to a single, shared TV-specific Instagram account, but the company said it would \"apply content standards suitable for a broad audience,\" which would likely keep teenagers from being recommended Reels containing videos related to drugs, alcohol and sexualized content.WATCH: There's no way to relate Meta to interest rates, says Jim Cramer.watch now",

    "body": "Key tax credits that reduce the cost of Affordable Care Act health insurance coverage for millions of Americans looked likely to expire by the end of the year after House Speaker Mike Johnson said Tuesday that there would be no vote on extending those subsidies this week.The House is not in session next week, meaning that Johnson was not leaving the door open for a later vote before the boosted ACA premium assistance expires.There remains a chance that enough Republicans in Johnson's majority caucus agree to back a Democrat-led effort to force an effective vote on extending the tax credits for Obamacare health plans.The tactic, a discharge petition, is identical to one recently used to force a vote on a bill compelling the release by the Department of Justice of investigative files related to sex predator Jeffrey Epstein.Read more CNBC politics coverageTrump sues BBC for $10 billion, claims defamation from Panorama documentaryPentagon takes big stake in new Korea Zinc refinery in Tenn., gets 10% of companyNew Trump tariffs collection hits $200 billion, Customs saysFormer Instacart employee says she was fired over her Democratic congressional campaignUkraine peace talks progressing, Russia open to EU membership, U.S. officials sayNew York AG sues UPS for allegedly shorting Christmas season workers' wagesTrump admin to hire 1,000 specialists for 'Tech Force'Trump doubles down on Rob Reiner criticism after killing; director's son in custodyTSA is giving airline passenger data to ICE for deportation push: NYTTrump's AI order may be 'illegal,' Democrats and consumer advocacy groups claimTrump sued by preservation group seeking to halt White House ballroom projectTrump says 'no big deal' after new Epstein photos showing him releasedPutin can fund war for years, ex-official says as Trump's resolve is testedIndiana redistricting bill that Trump demanded defeated in state SenateHouse passes INVEST Act to ease investment standards, boost capital in marketsDOJ fails again to indict New York AG James, a Trump target: ReportsTrump 'sells out' U.S. national security with Nvidia chip sales to China: WarrenTrump pushes for top prosecutor nominee Halligan after Comey, James cases tossedTrump willing to seize more oil tankers off Venezuela coast: White HouseSeized tanker will go to U.S. port, Trump admin intends 'to seize the oil'GOP lawmakers seek Trump aid for agricultural equipment after tariff pressureTrump says Fed could have 'at least doubled' latest interest rate cut'Spoof' ship: Seized oil tanker hid location, visited Iran and VenezuelaTrump admin touts pulling 9,500 truckers off road for failing English testsSwiss government says new 15% U.S. tariff ceiling retroactive to mid-NovemberHomeland Security Dept. buying Boeing 737s for ICE deportationsTrump officials move to end student loan payment pause for millions of borrowersJudge unseals Ghislaine Maxwell grand jury materials, citing Epstein files actUkraine at 'critical moment' in war as European allies ramp up pressure on RussiaDemocrats establish AI working group as industry bolsters DC presenceEx-Trump lawyer Habba resigns as NJ U.S. attorney after disqualification\"We looked for a way to try to allow that pressure release valve, and it just was not to be,\" Johnson, R-La., said at a press conference, referring to the looming expiration date for the aid.\"We worked on it all the way through the weekend, in fact, and in the end, an agreement wasn't made,\" he said.Republican leadership in the House is continuing to push for a novel cost-sharing plan that would make it easier for small employers to provide their own health-care plans. A vote on that proposal remains set for Wednesday.\"It offers commonsense solutions to lower premium costs for everybody, all Americans,\" Johnson said. \"It expands access to quality care, provides every American with more options and flexibility to choose coverage that works for them and it brings greater transparency to America's health-care system.\"But Democrats and some moderate Republicans are continuing to push for votes on an extension of the enhanced Obamacare premium credits.The health policy research group KFF has said that about 22 million Americans, or more than 90% of total enrollment in ACA insurance coverage, receive enhanced subsidies, which were made available during the Covid-19 pandemic to increase the pool of people who are eligible for reduced health coverage premiums.KFF has estimated that when the boosted subsidies expire, people's premiums would more than double in 2026 on average.The deadline for signing up for ACA plan coverage on Obamacare marketplaces for 2026 was this past Monday.Moderate Republicans who want the credits extended are pushing a pair of bipartisan discharge petitions from Reps. Brian Fitzpatrick, R-Pa., and Josh Gottheimer, D-N.J., to force Johnson to hold a vote on their health-care bills to extend the credits with other reforms. That effort now appears to be on life support after Johnson's statement Tuesday.House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., who has has yet to back either of the bipartisan options, is pushing his own discharge petition that has the signatures of all 214 House Democrats. Only four Republicans need to break ranks and sign his petition to force a vote on his bill that would extend the credits. So far, Republicans have not done so, in the hopes that Jeffries will endorse one of the bipartisan proposals.\"I am pissed for the American people, this is absolute bulls---,\" said Rep. Mike Lawler of New York, a moderate Republican who is pushing for an extension of the credits, after he emerged from a GOP conference meeting Tuesday morning. \"If Hakeem Jeffries was serious about this, he would actually tell his conference, go sign the discharges and let's force a vote,\" Lawler said. \"But he's not, and that's the problem.\"Rep. Kevin Kiley, R-Calif., a supporter of the discharge petitions, said, \"Leadership of both parties are failing to take reasonable steps to support the compromise measure.\"Kiley said that Jeffries \"is instead insisting the only way to go is this three-year clean extension\" of the tax credits, with \"no reforms, which has already failed the Senate and so wouldn't become law if it passed the House anyway.\"Fitzpatrick's proposal would extend the credits through 2027. His petition has 24 signatures, well short of the 218 signatures needed to force a vote.Fitzpatrick said on Tuesday that he expects Jeffries' discharge petition will obtain 218 signatures.",

    "body": "Smith Collection | Archive Photos | Getty ImagesPfizer on Tuesday forecast modest 2026 guidance as it looks to longer-term investments in its pipeline to counter waning Covid product sales and declines from older drugs.Those hurdles aren't surprising or new for Pfizer, which has seen a dramatic decline in Covid vaccine and antiviral sales after raking in record-setting revenue during the pandemic. The drugmaker has pursued deals of all sizes in recent years to build new revenue streams, such as its recently closed $10 billion acquisition of the obesity biotech Metsera and the whopping $43 billion tie-up for cancer drugmaker Seagen in 2023. But the guidance underscores that those investments are still some distance from paying off. Metsera, for example, brings a pipeline of drugs that are still in early-stage development. Shares of the company slid nearly 5% on Tuesday. The stock is also down about 5% for the year.The drugmaker expects adjusted profit to come in between $2.80 and $3 per share next year. That's slightly below analysts' consensus estimate of $3.05 per share for the year, according to LSEG. Revenue is expected to total $59.5 billion to $62.5 billion, which would largely be flat compared to Pfizer's new 2025 sales guidance of $62 billion. Analysts were expecting 2026 sales of $61.59 billion, LSEG estimates said. The company said the lackluster revenue outlook comes in part from declining sales of its Covid vaccine and antiviral pill Paxlovid. Pfizer forecasts 2026 sales from these products will fall by about $1.5 billion year-over-year to $5 billion. Pfizer also pointed to another roughly $1.5 billion year-over-year expected drop in sales due to certain products losing their market exclusivity. Some blockbuster drugs, such as the company's pneumonia vaccine Prevnar, are facing more competition from rivals.Pfizer's patent expirations are primarily expected to occur in 2026 and 2028, the company's CFO Dave Denton said on an investor call Tuesday. He said the drugmaker expects $17 billion in revenues to be impacted by patent and regulatory exclusivity expirations. The blood thinner Eliquis, among the company's top sellers, will also have lower prices in Medicare starting next year after negotiations with the government as part of the Inflation Reduction Act. Some analysts also noted that the guidance likely reflects costs tied to the company's recent acquisitions, including Metsera. In a note Tuesday, JPMorgan analyst Chris Schott called the outlook \"largely expected.\" He said the Covid headwinds and research and development investments will be partially offset by ongoing restructuring at the company. On an investor call Tuesday, Pfizer said it exceeded its cost-saving goals for 2025. The company is targeting more than $7 billion in cost cuts by 2027, and said Tuesday that it expects to deliver the majority of those savings by next year.Meanwhile, BMO Capital Markets analyst Evan Seigerman said the slightly lower 2026 outlook \"leaves room [for] adjustments in light of vaccine policy uncertainty.\" Pfizer and other drugmakers have had to grapple with changes to U.S. vaccine policy under Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a prominent shot skeptic. \"Given uncertainty with HHS policy, and infection rates we appreciate conservative estimates and cost-savings … heading into the new year,\" Seigerman said. On the call, Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla said comments by the Food and Drug Administration around shots \"don't have merit\" and are \"not going to change the way we are looking at our long term investments in vaccines.\" Bourla did not point to specific remarks, but said he believes \"this anomaly will correct itself.\" Earlier this year, Pfizer struck a landmark drug pricing deal with the Trump administration, which includes selling its existing drugs to Medicaid patients at the lowest price offered in other developed nations. Pfizer will also guarantee the same \"most-favored-nation\" pricing on its new drugs for Medicare, Medicaid and commercial payers.In return, the company will get a three-year exemption from President Donald Trump's pharmaceutical-specific tariffs. Denton said there is \"price compression and margin compression baked into\" the company's 2026 guidance as it plans to provide \"deeper discounts\" in its Medicaid business as part of the deal with Trump. ",

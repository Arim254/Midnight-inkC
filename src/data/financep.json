    "body": "Amid high-profile job cuts at major companies like Meta, Amazon and Target, many workers are undoubtedly anxious about future downsizing.According to Jason Walker and Rey Ramirez, co-founders of Thrive HR Consulting, a significant portion of these recent job cuts can be credited to AI.\"Companies are seeing their ability to be more efficient and use less staff with AI, and so they're taking the opportunity right now to reduce staff,\" Walker says.Another reason could be that toward the end of the year, companies \"start to look at head count, they start to look at cost, and there's just general trimming of employees based upon that,\" he says.From an employee's perspective, these job cuts may feel sudden, but there are a few signs workers should pay attention to that could indicate a coming layoff, according to Walker, Ramirez and other experts.Hiring and spending slow downAccording to Jalonni Weaver, a high-volume recruiter based in Dallas, the number one portent of an upcoming layoff is a \"slowdown in hiring.\" It's a red flag when a company stops posting new roles, or when roles remain open for months, Weaver says.That may signal that the company could be in financial trouble — and for Weaver, a decrease in recruiting work meant that her own job was in jeopardy.A hiring freeze doesn't necessarily mean that layoffs are imminent, but \"it's never a good sign that you're doing well financially,\" Walker says.Similarly, she advises workers to keep an eye out for sharp decreases in company spending. When a company is having money troubles, perks like free snacks and ping-pong tables \"go away\" she says, and year-end bonuses could shrink or vanish entirely.With these changes, \"the culture usually shifts,\" Weaver says, and \"nobody's really happy.\"Corporate messaging changesPay attention to what leaders are saying about the future of the business, Ramirez says.Phrases like \"We need to be more efficient\" are potential red flags that the company is looking to cut headcount, according to Ramirez.When a company begins to emphasize operations over innovation, \"that's usually a sign that change is coming, and that people will be impacted,\" according to Rosie Nestingen, an organizational transformation consultant.\"If one quarter you're focused on innovation and impact, and then the next quarter on 'buckling down,'\" that could be a sign of impending layoffs, she says.\"There's a lot of language that starts to [plant] the seeds and set the foundation for what is coming,\" she continues.People trickle outThe last major sign of impending layoffs is \"quiet firing,\" Weaver says, which she defines as companies \"finding ways to push people out, regardless of their performance,\" without conducting formal layoffs.For example, hourly employees may find that their typical weekly hours have been cut in half, Ramirez says.\"Employees can't afford to live on 30 or 40 or 50% less pay, so that almost by design starts to push people out of the organization,\" he says.RTO mandates can be used as another method to reduce headcount, according to Walker: after working remotely for years, studies show that many employees would rather look for another job than return to the office.If co-workers and higher-ups start leaving the company of their own accord, it might be a good idea to follow their example, Weaver says.They may be aware that the company isn't doing well, or they could be stifled by a lack of growth opportunities.How employees can prepareIf you notice red flags that could indicate impending layoffs, \"don't just ignore it or think 'it'll never happen to me,'\" Weaver says.Her biggest piece of advice for employees is to \"always keep your resume up to date,\" she says.Staying abreast of market trends is key, according to Weaver. She advises workers to peruse job descriptions for similar roles and pay attention to which skills are on the rise.Weaver recommends asking yourself, \"What has changed, what are they looking for in newer people, and how can I get that experience in my current role?\"She also suggests that employees periodically apply to other roles, \"even if you are happy at your job,\" to make sure that their resumes remain competitive.Walker has similar advice. \"Your resume should be ready to go,\" he says. \"It should look the best it's ever looked, and if you're getting an inkling of the fact that you think you're going to go, start sending it out in advance, start sending it out right away.\"In today's job market, \"you're not going to be successful with the traditional methods,\" Walker says.Instead of just sending over an application, Walker recommends connecting directly with the hiring manager for the roles you want.\"The ability to get in front of people more personally is really important right now,\" he says.Above all, don't get complacent at your job, Weaver says: \"It's okay to love where you work, but don't get too comfortable to where you miss signs that things are going on.\"\"At the end of the day, businesses are going to do what they need to do for themselves,\" she continues.Want to level up your AI skills? Sign up for Smarter by CNBC Make It's new online course, How To Use AI To Communicate Better At Work.

    "body": "Signage outside the Chevron Corp. headquarters in Houston, Texas, US, on Wednesday, Oct. 8, 2025. Mark Felix | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesChevron on Friday reported third-quarter financial results that beat Wall Street estimates, as the company achieved record production due in part to its acquisition of Hess Corp.The oil major's net income declined 21% to $3.54 billion, or $1.82 per share, compared with $4.49 billion, or $2.48 per share, in the same period last year. Its earnings decreased year over year due to falling oil prices and a $235 million loss on transaction costs associated with the Hess acquisition.Excluding costs associated with Hess and foreign currency impacts, Chevron earned $1.85 per share, beating Wall Street estimates of $1.68 per share. It reported revenue of $49.73 billion in the quarter, down about 2% from the $50.67 billion in the year-ago period.Chevron's shares were trading more than 3% higher.Here is what Chevron reported for the third quarter compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:Earnings per share: $1.85 adjusted vs. $1.68 expectedRevenue: $49.73 billion vs. $49.01 billion expectedU.S. crude oil prices have fallen about 16% this year as OPEC+ increases production and President Donald Trump's tariffs have the market worried about an economic slowdown.Even with lower prices, Chevron pumped a record 4.1 million barrels per day, a 21% increase compared with the same period last year. Higher production came from the Hess acquisition, the Permian Basin, the Gulf of Mexico and Kazakhstan, according to the company.Chevron's U.S. production business posted a profit of $1.28 billion, down 34% compared with $1.95 billion in the third quarter of 2024. It pumped 2 million barrels per day, up 27% from 1.6 million bpd in year-ago period.International production recorded earnings of $2 billion, down 24% compared with $2.64 billion in the same quarter last year. Production increased 16% to 2 million bpd compared with 1.76 million bpd in the year-ago period.Profit increased more than 300% to $638 million in Chevron's downstream U.S. refining business, compared with $146 million in the third quarter of 2024. Refining profits increased year over year due to higher margins on product sales. International refining posted earnings of $499 million, up 11% from $449 million in the year-ago period.Capital expenditures increased 7% to $4.4 billion over the year-ago quarter because of spending on legacy Hess assets. Chevron's adjusted free cash flow rose about 50% to $7 billion over the year-ago period.Correction: Chevron reported earnings of $1.85 per share compared with $1.68 expected by an LSEG survey of Wall Street analysts. An earlier version misstated the estimate.",

    "body": "Shoppers carry Macy's and Nordstrom bags at Broadway Plaza in Walnut Creek, California, US, on Monday, Dec. 16, 2024. The Bureau of Economic Analysis is scheduled to release personal spending figures on December 20.David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesWhile the impact so far this year has been muted, tariffs are expected to catch up with prices consumers pay just in time for the holiday shopping season.President Donald Trump's tariffs on a plethora of items and individual countries, which started in April, have coincided with common inflation measures trudging along between 2.5% and 3% this year.While economists don't see a major spike coming in common measures such as the consumer price and the personal consumption price indexes, they expect the tariffs will keep those gauges elevated at a time when they otherwise would be moving lower.\"There have been some questions in recent months as to whether tariffs have led to higher inflation for consumers,\" Bank of America economist Aditya Bhave said in a note. \"We think there's no debate — tariffs have pushed consumer prices higher.\"Tariff impacts have been muted so far as companies built up inventories ahead of the duties and absorbed some of the impact through compressed profit margins.Bank of America, though, expects that tariffs will be adding about half a percentage point to the core PCE measure the Federal Reserve uses when assessing inflation. With tariffs, BofA estimates that the inflation rate would be 2.9% in September, so without them that would mean a measure closer to 2.4%. The numbers are similar to ones Fed Chair Jerome Powell cited Wednesday. The core PCE on an annual basis was 2.9% in August.These percentage point differences matter to the Fed, which tries to keep core inflation, excluding food and energy, at 2%, a level it has been above since March 2021. Two Fed officials — regional presidents Jeffrey Schmid of Kansas City and Lorie Logan of Dallas — said Friday they did not agree with their colleagues' decision Wednesday to lower the central bank's key interest rate.For consumers, they also matter. Bhave estimates that shoppers are bearing about 50%-70% of total tariff costs, with businesses bearing the rest.Impact at the cash registerIn real-world terms, that's meant higher prices for things such as coffee, furniture and, recently, clothing prices, which jumped 0.7% in September, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Even though they are minor components of the price indexes, they are items consumers buy frequently and can create perceptions about inflation, which can produce a self-reinforcing cycle that drives prices higher.\"Inflation in certain goods can have an outsized impact on consumer confidence, even if those items carry a negligible weight in the CPI basket,\" TD Cowen analysts said in a note. Price increases in items such as eggs create \"a constant, tangible feedback loop every week at the grocery store. Such items shape perception more than their statistical significance would suggest.\"The firm noted that this holiday season could see more of that sort of thing as artificial Christmas trees are almost all imported from China, which faces heavy costs under the Trump tariffs.\"While Artificial Christmas trees are not unique, they serve as a clear example of how high-tariff, seasonal goods can shape consumer perceptions of inflation,\" Cowen said.Had the duties been in place during the 2024 holiday season, shoppers would have spent an additional $40.6 billion, according to LendingTree estimates using data from multiple government and private sources.LendingTree's Budget Lab further estimates that some 70.5% of new tariffs were passed onto consumers in June 2025.\"That means that even more Americans would have had to fall back on credit cards and personal loans to help cover gift-buying expenses,\" said Matt Schultz, the firm's chief consumer finance analyst. \"That's the unfortunate reality that many people would have faced.\"Using the same estimates, LendingTree said the tariff cost comes to $132 per shopper.",

Earnings per share totaled 80 cents, surpassing an estimate of 51 cents.Reddit also released a better-than-expected sales outlook for the fourth quarter. The company projects between $655 million and $665 million, topping the $638 million forecast from Wall Street.These results \"speak to the company's continued progress across its ad and platform initiatives,\" wrote Morgan Stanley analyst Brian Nowak. \"We see a long runway for growth across both active advertisers (+75% y/y in 3Q) as well as greater penetration within existing advertisers.\"Reddit said that nine of its top 15 advertiser verticals grew more than 50%.

The oil major is talking with power companies to decarbonize their plants, he said. \"We're pretty advanced in the conversations,\" the CEO said.The tech sector has mostly secured renewable energy to offset the emissions from their data centers, though they are now making major investments in nuclear power as well.Some companies are turning to natural gas as well as they search for reliable power. Meta, for example, signed an agreement with the utility Entergy in Louisiana to power a data center campus with natural gas.\"We secured locations.

    "body": "White House Lincoln Bathroom Renovation.Source: @realdonaldtrump | Truth SocialFirst it was the Oval Office,  then the East Wing — now it's the Lincoln Bedroom's bathroom.President Donald Trump on Friday proudly showed off the latest project in his inside-and-out remodel of the White House — as critics slammed him as \"tone deaf\" for touting glitzy renovations during the costly government shutdown.Trump shared two dozen photos of the newly refurbished bathroom, which is now covered from floor to ceiling with what he described as \"black and white polished Statuary marble.\"Renovated Lincoln Bathroom in the White House.Source: @realdonaldtrump | Truth Social\"This was very appropriate for the time of Abraham Lincoln and, in fact, could be the marble that was originally there!\" Trump wrote in one of seven Truth Social posts containing photos of the renovation.The bathroom also sports gold-colored fixtures and accents — including the bath and sink faucets, wall sconces and trash bin — as well as a crystal hanging chandelier, the photos show.Trump told NBC News in July that he planned to update the bathroom of the historic Lincoln Bedroom in a style that is truer to the era of the 16th president, who held office from 1861 until his assassination in 1865.The previous decor, an art deco green tile style, was \"totally inappropriate for the Lincoln Era,\" Trump wrote in Friday's post.The Lincoln Bathroom in the White House before renovation.Source: @realdonaldtrump | Truth SocialTrump's Democratic critics pounced on the construction updates, slamming him for focusing on the bathroom remodel while a government shutdown, now in its 31st day, threatens access to crucial federal services.\"Donald Trump actually cares more about his toilet than he does about fixing your healthcare,\" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., wrote in an X post.\"Millions of people are being kicked off of food assistance and millions can't afford health care anymore. But don't worry everyone! Trump got a new bathroom,\" Democratic commentator Harry Sisson wrote on X.\"So tone deaf, out of touch, and disgusting,\" Sisson added.\"We are in a serious govt shutdown, but instead of negotiating, Trump posted several pics of his WH bathroom remodel today and now this,\" wrote Ron Filipowski, editor in chief of the anti-Trump media outlet MeidasTouch.Asked for a response to those critiques, White House spokesman Davis Ingle told CNBC, \"Democrats are more concerned with President Trump's historic beautification of the White House than they are for American citizens they are hurting because of their reckless government shutdown.\"In another Truth Social post Friday, Trump announced that he had inspected construction taking place at the Kennedy Center, where, months earlier, he had fired several board members and installed himself as chair.\"It is really looking good!\" he wrote. \"The exterior columns, which were in serious danger of corrosion if something weren't done, are completed, and look magnificent in White Enamel — Like a different place!\"\"Marble is being done, stages are being renovated, new seats, new chairs, and new fabrics will soon be installed, and magnificent high end carpeting throughout the building,\" Trump wrote.The update came hours after The Washington Post reported that ticket sales at the Kennedy Center have plummeted in recent months.Read more CNBC politics coverageShutdown cost government contractors $12B so far: U.S. Chamber of CommerceThe big takeaways from the Trump-Xi meeting — what the truce coversShipping sector skeptical Trump's latest trade truce with China will reverse import declineTrump-Xi meeting nears with high stakes and hopes, but few detailsGovernment shutdown could cost U.S. economy up to $14 billion, CBO says",

    "body": "Drone view of damage to coastal homes after Hurricane Melissa made landfall, in Alligator Pond, Jamaica, Oct. 29, 2025. Maria Alejandra Cardona | ReutersHurricane Melissa, the most powerful Atlantic hurricane of the year, made landfall this week as a Category 5 storm in Jamaica. The strength of the storm means it will likely trigger a full payout from a catastrophe bond designed to provide funds to the island in the event of catastrophic weather events.The $150 million catastrophe bond, structured by Aon, is intended to help the island's people rebuild after natural disasters by providing Jamaica parametric coverage against losses from named storms. The policy took effect this year and lasts through 2027.The government of Jamaica is the first government in the Caribbean region, and the first of any small island state, to independently sponsor a cat bond, according to Aon. Its likely payout demonstrates the value of a unique type of backstop funded by the private markets.watch nowIn order to trigger the full payment, the storm has to meet a particular strength criteria. The central pressure of the storm must be at or below 900 millibars as its makes landfall and crosses the island nation.Early data from the National Hurricane Center shows Hurricane Melissa's pressure stayed below 900 millibars in several areas. Those readings are in the process of being verified by an independent calculation agent.\"While the final numbers are still being verified, the early signs suggest the transaction is doing what it was designed to do: getting critical funds to the country quickly after a major disaster,\" Chris Lefferdink, Aon's head of insurance-linked securities for North America, said in a statement.  The review process typically takes 2 to 3 weeks, and the earliest possible payout to Jamaica could come in approximately 1 month, according to a spokesperson from Aon.A drone view shows an affected area after Hurricane Melissa made landfall, in Crane Road, Black River, Jamaica, October 30, 2025. Maria Alejandra Cardona | ReutersPrevious parametric transactions payouts have taken 3 months or more, but for this event Aon used an innovative data source to enable faster payments.The catastrophe bond was placed using the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development's \"capital at risk\" program, which is used to transfer the risks associated with natural catastrophes to the capital markets, allowing the country to access funds quickly after a major event.\"What you have is a capital provider putting funds in the pool, an insurer putting the coupon for those funds in the pool [and] if the storm hits that criteria, they get the money in a much quicker fashion,\" Aon CFO Edmund Reese told CNBC's Contessa Brewer in an interview.Damaged furniture and debris after Hurricane Melissa made landfall, in Black River, Jamaica, Oct. 30, 2025. Octavio Jones | ReutersCatastrophe bond and insurance-linked securities were created in the mid 1990s in the wake of Hurricane Andrew's destruction. They've since grown in popularity, with the cat bond market growing by over 50% since the end of 2022 to nearly $55 billion.\"Public-private partnerships like Jamaica's continue to highlight how parametric insurance can deliver rapid, transparent relief in the wake of severe storms,\" Lefferdink said.Jamaica very narrowly missed the requirements necessary to receive a payout from a separate cat bond when Hurricane Beryl battered the island in 2024, resulting in $995 million in damages to homes, crops and infrastructure, according to the National Hurricane Center.",

    "body": "A customer shops for Halloween candy at a Walmart Supercenter on October 16, 2024 in Austin, Texas. Brandon Bell | Getty ImagesThe scariest thing haunting Halloween this year isn't a ghost, goblin or ghoul — it's the price of chocolate.From Snickers to Reese's to Twix, one of America's favorite indulgences is getting more expensive, as tariffs, inflation and high cocoa prices squeeze profit margins and customers' pocketbooks, possibly leading to fewer chocolate bars landing in trick-or-treat buckets this year.Chocolate prices have surged nearly 30% since last Halloween and almost 78% in the past five years, according to data from research firm Circana and the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. A 100-piece variety bag of candy now costs $16.39, up from $7.20 in 2020, FinanceBuzz found.That spike is showing up on store shelves. Variety packs from Hershey — maker of Reese's, KitKats and Heath bars — are up about 22%, while Mars, the company behind M&M's and Milky Way, raised prices about 12%, according to the Century Foundation, a progressive, independent think tank, and the Groundwork Collaborative.\"The season did get off to a slow start,\" Hershey CEO Kirk Tanner told investors on an earnings call Thursday, warning that holiday sales could be softer this year.About 4 in 5 Americans buy candy for the Halloween holiday, according to YouGov. This time of year makes up about 18% of annual U.S. confectionery sales — second only to Christmas, according to the National Confectioners Association.But chocolate's dominance is slipping. Circana found it made up 52% of Halloween candy sales last year, compared with 44% this year, as shoppers shift toward cheaper, trendier sweets.\"Macroeconomic headwinds\" are among the culprits, said Sally Wyatt, who works for Circana analyzing global consumer packaged goods and as a food-service industry advisor. \"It's the compounded impact on top of the fact that we've outpaced wage growth. So consumers have started to ... [make] very specific choices on discretionary items.\"Sector-wide, candy prices are outpacing the national inflation rate, marking a roughly 10% increase compared with last year, according to the Century Foundation. Still, the National Retail Federation said 2025 is expected to be a record year for candy sales in the U.S., with about $3.9 billion spent on Halloween candy alone.\"Even as consumers face higher prices for food, they continue to leave room in their budgets for chocolate and candy, meaning that the category is strong, vibrant and growing,\" Carly Schildhaus, a spokesperson for the National Confectioners Association, told CNBC.Much of the chocolate filling U.S. shelves this fall was made from cocoa beans purchased at record prices last December, when futures peaked above $12,000 per ton, experts said. Prices have since cooled to around $6,000, but that's still more than double the pre-pandemic average.A cocktail of rising temperatures, erratic rainfall, drought and crop disease for the past three years has devastated harvests in West Africa, which produces roughly 70% of the world's cocoa. The result: the largest global cocoa deficit in 60 years, with supply falling half a million tons short of demand.Prices could stabilize, but not decrease, by next year as crop yields have increased, said David Branch, a sector manager at Wells Fargo Agri-Food Institute.\"It's not just the cost of manufacturing cocoa and other ingredients,\" Branch told CNBC. \"It's also a combination of labor, transportation, fuel, overhead [and] all of those factors, and, given the inflationary rate we've been in, those came up and haven't really come down.\"Hershey said Thursday that tariff expenses will cost the company $160 million to $170 million this year. In July, it also announced a \"low double-digit\" price hike, though executives said those increases weren't tied to tariffs or Halloween pricing.Chocolate makers have lobbied the Trump administration for tariff exemptions on cocoa and other agricultural imports, arguing they have little ability to source those ingredients domestically.Sweet varietyAs chocolate becomes more expensive, fruity, sour and chewy candies have gotten more popular. More than half of shoppers said they planned to prioritize gummy candies for Halloween this year, NielsenIQ found.On average, the price per pound of chocolate rose nearly 14% in the 12 weeks ending Oct. 5, while sales volumes fell 6%, Circana data show. Non-chocolate Halloween candy such as Jolly Ranchers and Skittles saw sales climb 8.3% in that same period.Younger adults, especially Gen Z, are also fueling growth in non-chocolate categories — gravitating toward gummies, freeze-dried sweets and TikTok-friendly flavor mashups.\"It's that experiential [aspect] because you can have it [non-chocolate items] with chewy, with sweet flavors, with hot and sweet, spicy flavors,\" Wyatt told CNBC. \"Some candies you get this big explosion in your mouth of flavors. We've seen it popular with different cohorts.\"Chocolate makers are responding in kind. Hershey has expanded its gummy lineup, including a partnership with Shaquille O'Neal, and rolled out ghost-shaped Twizzlers and mismatched \"Trickies\" Jolly Rancher gummies.Mondelez International, maker of Cadbury and Toblerone, said it's also prioritizing gummies in the U.S. market. CEO Dirk Van de Put said on an earnings call Tuesday, however, that the U.S. market in particular \"is slower than we've seen in quite a while\" and the company's promotional strategy earlier this year \"was not giving us the volume effect that we were hoping for.\"Manufacturers are also experimenting with smaller bars, new fillings and cocoa-free options such as crème or nut-based confections to offset rising ingredient costs, Branch said.\"Companies have got to be very aware of if they can keep their prices in line. They can't just keep increasing their prices and expect sales to continue to go up,\" Branch said. \"But customers have not lost their appetite for chocolate. It's going to remain an indulgence that people will always have and can't really do without.\"",

    "body": "Photo illustration of the YouTube TV logo displayed on a smartphone, with the YouTube logo in the background.Nurphoto | Nurphoto | Getty ImagesDisney content, including channels like ABC and ESPN, was removed from Google's YouTube TV overnight after the two companies failed to renew a streaming contract. \"Despite our best efforts, we have not been able to reach a fair deal, and starting today, Disney programming will not be available on YouTube TV,\" the platform said in a statement.More than 20 channels would be removed from YouTube TV, the company said, adding if the content is unavailable for an extended period of time, the company would offer users a $20 credit. Affected networks include ESPN and its sister sports networks, ABC, FX, NatGeo, Disney Channel and Freeform. Disney said in a statement, \"Google's YouTube TV has chosen to deny their subscribers the content they value most by refusing to pay fair rates for our channels, including ESPN and ABC.\"Disney Entertainment Co-Chairs Dana Walden and Alan Bergman and ESPN Chairman Jimmy Pitaro sent a memo to all Disney employees Friday, noting that YouTube TV also \"deleted all [Disney] previously recorded shows and events from their subscribers' libraries\" in addition to failing to strike a deal.\"Their actions make clear how little regard they have for their customers and are consistent with an attitude which has been prevalent throughout our negotiations — YouTube TV and its owner, Google, are not interested in achieving a fair deal with us,\" wrote Walden, Bergman and Pitaro. \"Instead, they want to use their power and extraordinary resources to eliminate competition and devalue the very content that helped them build their service.\"The two sides had been engaged in negotiations but were unable to reach a new distribution agreement before their existing contract expired Oct. 30 at 11:59 p.m. ET. YouTube TV subscribers risk losing access to college football if a deal isn't struck by Saturday morning and \"Monday Night Football\" if programming isn't returned by the start of next week.Disney warned last week it could result in a content blackout.In a Thursday statement on its official blog, YouTube argued Disney had \"used the threat of a blackout on YouTube TV as a negotiating tactic to force deal terms that would raise prices on our customers,\" and that Disney was now following through on that threat.\"We will not agree to terms that disadvantage our members while benefiting Disney's own live TV products,\" YouTube TV said in a post on its help center webpage. Disney's live TV offerings include Hulu + Live TV and Fubo.\"We know how disruptive it is to lose channels you enjoy, and we're committed to continuing to work with Disney to reach an agreement,\" YouTube said in its statement.YouTube TV pays broadcasters to stream their channels and has been engaged in several tense negotiations over contract renewals in recent months.Last month, NBCUniversal content was nearly removed from YouTube TV before the companies reached an agreement after a temporary extension, preventing shows like \"Sunday Night Football\" and \"America's Got Talent\" from being pulled.CNBC reported last week that Disney was willing to offer YouTube TV a distribution agreement that would give some subscribers access to Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+ for no extra charge. Disney has previously offered similar terms to Charter, the largest U.S. pay TV provider by subscribers.However, YouTube asked for Disney's streaming content to be ingested into YouTube TV, giving customers the ability to view programming on Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+ without leaving the platform, according to a source familiar with the negotiations.Disney had rejected that proposal and had no plans to budge on the request, people familiar with the company's thinking told CNBC. Disney has no interest in adding its streaming services to YouTube Primetime Channels, the people said.The recent clash between Disney and YouTube has an added twist, after YouTube hired former Disney distribution executive Justin Connolly earlier this year, prompting Disney to file a breach-of-contract lawsuit.Connolly has recused himself from the discussions, CNBC previously reported, according to the people familiar with the process. Disney and YouTube reportedly settled the lawsuit.YouTube is the top U.S. media distributor by audience engagement, capturing over 13% of TV watch-time in July, according to Nielsen. It is also on track to be the biggest media company by revenue in 2025, beating Disney, analysts at MoffettNathanson told CNBC.— CNBC's Alex Sherman contributed to this report.Disclosure: Comcast is the parent company of NBCUniversal, which owns CNBC. Versant would become the new parent company of CNBC upon Comcast's planned spinoff of Versant.Clarification: This article has been updated to clarify that NBCUniversal content was nearly removed from YouTube TV last month before those companies reached an agreement.",

    "body": "Jerome Powell, chairman of the US Federal Reserve, during a news conference following a Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting in Washington, DC, US, on Wednesday, Oct. 29, 2025. Al Drago | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesFederal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell faces if not the most difficult challenge of his time in office at least the trickiest in his final months as head of the all-powerful U.S. central bank.Fresh off his surprisingly tough talk Wednesday on the potential for another interest rate cut in December, Powell will have to steer his way through a suddenly contentious atmosphere among policymakers that will make whichever direction the Fed chooses divisive.While it's not the existential economic threat posed by the Covid pandemic in 2020, it nevertheless indicates a level of peril uncommon for the institution.\"December could get messy,\" Bank of America economist Aditya Bhave said in a client note. \"We still think the Fed won't cut rates again under Chair Powell. But barring a clear signal in either direction from the data, the December decision will likely be even more contentious than October.\"The Fed on Wednesday approved a widely anticipated quarter percentage point rate reduction that took its benchmark rate down to 3.75%-4%. However, Powell warned that another cut in December \"is not a foregone conclusion,\" something the market was not expecting.While Wall Street economists and strategists were split over whether the committee will in fact approve another reduction at the Dec. 9-10 meeting, they were in agreement that this is a pivotal moment for Powell and the legacy he ultimately will leave when his term runs out in May.\"Even in a situation without much additional data due to the shutdown, it can actually make sense to push against market pricing to keep optionality going forward,\" wrote Michael Gapen, chief U.S. economist at Morgan Stanley. \"A 95% probability assigned to a December cut does not seem consistent with a data-dependent Fed.\"Markets reactFor their part, traders weren't buying the hawkish rhetoric. Fed fund futures pricing Thursday still indicated a 75% probability of a cut in December, though that was down from around 90% the day before, according to the CME Group's FedWatch.But Powell went to great lengths in his post-meeting news conference Wednesday to dispel the notion that the reduction, which would be the third since September, is a slam dunk.The thrust of his argument was multi-pronged: What data there is available during the government shutdown blackout has largely showed a stable economy though the labor market is a risk; inflation is still above target; and, in an unusual development, there are \"strongly differing\" views on the FOMC for where policy should move.Markets were clearly caught off guard by the move, with stocks slipping and Treasury yields surging. The 10-year Treasury yield was solidly above 4% Thursday while the policy-sensitive 2-year note climbed over 3.6% to its highest level in about a month.\"The reaction of the bond market should certainly give Fed officials pause,\" wrote Ed Yardeni, head of Yardeni Research and coiner of the term \"bond vigilantes\" to describe buyers' strikes in the fixed income markets. \"The bond market isn't buying the Fed's cover story that interest rates were too restrictive.\"For Powell, the statement regarding December was an unusual step considering markets had been expecting a more neutral tone. Asked whether he was bothered by the strong anticipation of another cut, Powell said markets should take his statement that a reduction \"is not a foregone conclusion\" should be \"taken on board.\"\"You've got get right in front of that, because you don't want to surprise the market a couple weeks down the road. Now is the time to do it,\" said Dan North, senior economist for North America at Allianz Trade. \"He doesn't usually use words quite so forcefully. So that was interesting, and he's clearly trying to squash speculation about December. We feel the same way, December is going to be a pause.\"Political overhangThe developments come at a ticklish time for the Fed.Powell, a favorite target for President Donald Trump's criticism, has only seven months or so left in his term. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has been busy interviewing potential successors — among them current Governors Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman, both of whom voted in favor of the cut.In addition, Governor Stephen Miran, a hand-picked Trump appointee who will only serve through January, again dissented from the vote in favor of a half-point.At the other end of the spectrum, Kansas City Fed President Jeffrey Schmid voted \"no\" as well, but because he wanted to not cut. Between them run a range of views on the normally consensus-driven FOMC.Whether Powell's tip of the hat to the doves reflects merely a courtesy or deeper misgivings about cuts will be central to Fed analysis in the coming weeks.\"While the press conference played out somewhat differently than we expected, we have not changed our Fed forecast and continue to see a December cut as quite likely,\" Goldman Sachs economist David Mericle wrote. \"We suspect that there is substantial opposition on the FOMC to the risk management cuts and that Powell thought it was important to voice other participants' concerns today in his press conference. But we still think that the arguments for a December cut remain intact.\"",

    "body": "Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang listens to a reporter's question during a press conference at the APEC CEO summit on October 31, 2025 in Gyeongju, South Korea. Ezra Acayan | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesNvidia CEO Jensen Huang doesn't buy the national security concerns over his firm selling its most advanced semiconductors to China, claiming collaboration is in everyone's best interest.Speaking to reporters in South Korea, Huang said he will keep campaigning for access to the Chinese market and is \"optimistic\" the country will continue to want U.S. chips as it positions itself as an AI leader.\"The way to think about the China market is, it's a singular, vital, important, dynamic market, and nobody can replace that,\" he said.\"It's in the best interest of America to serve that China market. It's in the best interest of China to have the American technology company bring ... technology to the China market ... It's in the best interest of both countries, and I hope that policymakers will ultimately come to that conclusion.\"watch nowHis comments come amid U.S. export curbs that restrict Chinese firms from buying advanced semiconductors used in the development of AI.President Donald Trump said Thursday that he had discussed the export of Nvidia chips with Chinese President Xi Jinping when the leaders met, but the discussions did not cover the most advanced Blackwell graphics processing units. \"I said that's really between [China] and Nvidia, but we're sort of the arbitrator,\" Trump said after the meeting.The U.S. says its chip curbs are designed to restrict both China's \"access to the technologies and ability to produce advanced chips\" and curtail its access to \"related computing and AI applications.\"But Huang indicated these concerns are misplaced.\"China makes plenty of AI chips themselves, and the Chinese military surely have plenty of access to chips that are created in China. So, whatever national security concerns, have to take into consideration the fact that China has blocked H20 [an Nvidia chip] and, so, in a lot of ways, China is saying that, 'listen, we have plenty of AI technology ourselves',\" Huang told CNBC's Eunice Yoon on Friday.watch now\"And so the national security concern, from that perspective, I think, is really answered by the fact that China doesn't want H20 or any American chips.\"'Foolish to underestimate Huawei'Chinese telecoms giant Huawei is also at the center of tech tensions between the U.S. and China.The federal use of Huawei products is banned in the U.S. over fears they could be used for spying by the Chinese government, while U.S. firms are also restricted from doing business with the firm. The bans came into force under Trump's first term.Huang said Nvidia is \"miles ahead\" in the chips race, but stressed, \"it is foolish to underestimate the might of China and the incredible, competitive spirit of Huawei.\"\"This is a company with extraordinary technology. They dominate the world's 5G telecommunication standards and technology. They build amazing smartphones, they build amazing chips, they're incredible at networking and so when they announced CloudMatrix, I was not surprised that they were able to create such an amazing thing,\" Huang said, referring to Huawei's large-scale AI supercomputing system.\"It's deeply uninformed to think that Huawei can't build systems. We take competition very seriously. We respect the competition, we respect deeply the capabilities of China. That's why we run so fast, and that's why we dedicate ourselves to inventing the future so we can get there before anybody else,\" he added.— CNBC's Eunice Yoon, Spencer Kimball and Arjun Kharpal contributed to reporting.",

    "body": "Jetcityimage | Istock | Getty ImagesThe U.S. Department of the Treasury has announced new rates for Series I bonds. Newly purchased I bonds will pay 4.03% annual interest from Nov. 1 through April 30, which is up from the 3.98% yield offered through Oct. 31.The new rate includes a variable portion of 3.12%, based on inflation data, and a fixed portion of 0.90%. The combined rate is 4.03% after rounding, according to the Treasury. The fixed rate is down from 1.10% announced in May.Read more CNBC personal finance coverageStudent loan class action effort: Trump official, credit agencies hurt borrowers' scoresTreasury Department: Series I bond rate of 4.03% through April 2026Taxpayers may see 'record tax refund season' in 2026, analysts sayMillions face 'huge sticker shock' when ACA open enrollment starts Nov. 1Here's the maximum 2026 Social Security full retirement benefit, after 2.8% COLAStudent loan forgiveness for public servants to be limited under TrumpDemocrats propose increasing VA, Social Security benefits by $200 a monthAdjustable-rate mortgages are 'underappreciated,' top advisor saysHow the 2026 Social Security payroll tax cap could impact your paycheckWhat this Fed rate cut means for your credit card, mortgage and savings accountHow the Fed's decision to lower rates could widen the generational wealth gapThis investing move is the 'holy grail of retirement planning,' advisor saysWhat another Fed cut could mean for borrowers — some rates may barely budgeWhat student loan borrowers need to know, as forgiveness resumes under two plansAmericans face a retirement 'confidence paradox': How to gauge readinessCNBC's Financial Advisor 100: Best financial advisors, top firms for 2025 rankedIn May 2022, the I bond rate hit a record high of 9.62%, and many investors flooded into the government-backed, nearly risk-free asset. Since then, some shorter-term investors have redeemed holdings amid falling inflation and rates. But other long-term investors have purchased I bonds over the past couple of years to lock in the higher fixed rate.How I bond rates workI bond rates have a variable and fixed portion, which the Treasury adjusts every six months, in May and November. The combined yield is known as the \"composite rate,\" which is paid to investors for a six-month period.   The variable rate is tied to inflation, and stays the same for six months after your purchase date, regardless of the Treasury's next adjustment. Meanwhile, the fixed rate stays the same for the life of your I bond after purchase. The fixed portion can be harder to predict, and the Treasury doesn't disclose how it calculates the change.watch nowHow the change impacts current I bond investorsIf you currently own I bonds, there's a six-month timeline for rate changes, which shifts depending on your original purchase date.After the first six months, the variable yield changes to the next announced rate. But the fixed rate stays the same for the entirety of your holding.For example, let's say you purchased I bonds in March. Your variable rate would be 1.90% and shifts to 2.86% in September. Your fixed rate remains at 1.2%. At that point, your new composite rate would be 4.06%.You can earn I bond interest for up to 30 years, or less if you redeem the assets before that. However, you can't cash in I bonds for at least one year after purchase. If you redeem within five years, you lose your last three months of interest.",

    "body": "US President Donald Trump (R) speaks during a meeting with Australia's Prime Minister Anthony Albanese in the Cabinet Room at the White House in Washington, DC, on Oct. 20, 2025. Saul Loeb | AFP | Getty ImagesA federal judge in Rhode Island on Friday blocked the Trump administration from ceasing to pay SNAP benefits that help feed 42 million Americans during the U.S. government shutdown.The oral ruling by Judge Jack McConnell, which directed that those food stamp benefits be paid out of emergency funds \"as soon as possible,\" came a day before the administration was set to cut off the aid.\"There is no doubt, and it is beyond argument, that irreparable harm will begin to occur if it hasn't already occurred in the terror it has caused some people about the availability of funding for food for their family,\" McConnell said.McConnell's ruling came minutes after another federal judge in Boston, who is overseeing a separate but similar lawsuit, said that the group of states that are plaintiffs in that case is likely to prove that the suspension of Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits was \"unlawful.\"That judge, Indira Talwani, gave the administration until Monday to tell her if it will authorize at least reduced SNAP benefits for November.President Donald Trump, in a statement on social media later Friday, said, \"Our Government lawyers do not think we have the legal authority to pay SNAP with certain monies we have available, and now two Courts have issued conflicting opinions on what we can and cannot do.\"\"I do NOT want Americans to go hungry just because the Radical Democrats refuse to do the right thing and REOPEN THE GOVERNMENT,\" Trump wrote on Truth Social. \"Therefore, I have instructed our lawyers to ask the Court to clarify how we can legally fund SNAP as soon as possible.\"\"If we are given the appropriate legal direction by the Court, it will BE MY HONOR to provide the funding, just like I did with Military and Law Enforcement Pay,\" he said.Lawyers for the plaintiffs in the case before McConnell argued at a court hearing Friday that the cutoff of SNAP benefits was an \"arbitrary and capricious act\" that had caused \"a crisis\" for the Americans who need food stamps to eat.A Justice Department lawyer argued that SNAP did not exist anymore because there were no congressionally appropriated funds for it as a result of the shutdown.The lawyer, Tyler Becker, also argued it was the administration's discretion whether to use up to $6 billion in contingency funds already set aside by Congress to continue issuing SNAP benefits.\"There is no SNAP program and, as a result, the government cannot just provide SNAP benefits,\" Becker said.\"A shutdown is not an emergency,\" said Becker, adding that if there was an emergency, it had been created by Congress in failing to appropriate money to keep the government operating.But McConnell told the administration to use the available contingency funds to maintain at least some of the SNAP benefits that are normally paid.The judge also said the administration needed to examine whether other federal funds would be available to keep the program operating in the absence of a funding bill by Congress.McConnell's ruling granted a temporary restraining order to plaintiffs who filed a lawsuit on Thursday in U.S. District Court in Providence against the Trump administration to maintain the benefits.White House National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett, during an interview Friday afternoon with NBC News' \"Meet the Press Now,\" would not say whether the Trump administration would comply with either court ruling. Read more CNBC government shutdown coverage Government shutdown could cost U.S. economy up to $14 billion, CBO

Senate procedural vote\"Today's ruling is a lifeline for millions of families, seniors, and veterans who depend on SNAP to put food on the table,\" the coalition of plaintiffs said in a statement.\"It reaffirms a fundamental principle: no administration can use hunger as a political weapon,\" the coalition said. \"This victory is about more than one program — it's about the American values of fairness, compassion, and accountability that hold our democracy together.\"The plaintiffs include a group of cities, charitable and faith-based non-profit groups, unions and business organizations.The Boston judge, Talwani, in her separate order on Friday, said she was still considering the plaintiffs' request for a temporary restraining order to maintain the benefits.But she also ordered the administration to tell her by Monday if it would \"authorize at least reduced SNAP benefits for November, and, if so, their timeline for determining whether to authorize only reduced SNAP benefits using the Contingency Funds or to authorize full SNAP benefits using both the Contingency Funds and additional available funds.\"Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., praised both rulings.\"Good,\" Schumer wrote in a post on the social media site X.\"Trump's decision to cut off SNAP was vindictive and heartless,\" Schumer wrote.\"He was trying to manufacture a hunger crisis so he wouldn't have to fix healthcare. No president in American history has cut off SNAP during a shutdown, including Trump during his own first term.\"Hassett, the National Economic Council director, blasted the rulings.\"We're about to use emergency funds from the Department of Agriculture because of a liberal judge ruling that we disagree at the law on,\" Hassett said in an interview on Fox News.\"But then we don't have our emergency funds in case we have a hurricane or we have an emergency -- a food emergency,\" Hassett said. \"And so we've got to get the government open. We've got to do it as soon as possible. And the Democrats really don't have a plan.\"The Trump administration blames Senate Democrats for the shutdown, given their refusal to vote for a short-term funding bill proposed by House Republicans, which does not include an extension of enhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies that Democrats insist on.",

Kent Nishimura | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesKorean semiconductor giant Samsung said Thursday that it plans to buy and deploy a cluster of 50,000 Nvidia graphics processing units to improve its chip manufacturing for mobile devices and robots.The 50,000 Nvidia GPUs will be used to create a facility Samsung is calling an \"AI Megafactory.\" Samsung didn't provide details about when the facility would be built.It's the latest splashy partnership for Nvidia, whose chips remain essential for building and deploying advanced artificial intelligence.The agreement with Samsung comes after Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang on Tuesday announced in Washington, D.C., that Nvidia was collaborating with companies including Palantir, Eli Lilly, CrowdStrike and Uber.Shortly after the speech, Huang was spotted in South Korea drinking beer with Samsung Chairman Lee Jae-yong and other business leaders, according to local media. Other Korean companies, including SK Group and Hyundai, are also deploying similar amounts of GPUs, Nvidia said.\"We're working closely with the Korean government to support its ambitious leadership plans in AI,\" Raymond Teh, Nvidia's senior vice president of Asia-Pacific, said on a call Wednesday with reporters.The partnerships support Huang's claim on Tuesday that Nvidia has a book of business that totals $500 billion from its current generation GPU, called Blackwell, in addition to its next-generation GPU, called Rubin.The forecast helped boost Nvidia's stock, making the company the first to reach a market cap of $5 trillion.On Thursday, Nvidia representatives said they will work with Samsung to adapt the Korean company's chipmaking lithography platform to work with Nvidia's GPUs. That process will results in 20 times better performance for Samsung, the Nvidia representatives said. Samsung will also use Nvidia's simulation software called Omniverse. Known for its mobile phones, Samsung also said it would use the Nvidia chips to run its own AI models for its devices.In addition to being a partner and customer, Samsung is also a key supplier for Nvidia.Samsung makes the kind of high-performance memory Nvidia uses in large quantities, alongside its AI chips, called high bandwidth memory. Samsung said it will work with Nvidia to tweak its HBM4 memory for use in AI chips.WATCH: Night out in Seoul: Nvidia, Samsung, and Hyundai bosses bond over fried chicken and sojuwatch now",

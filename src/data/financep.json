Bolton's attorney, Abbe Lowell, said that the former national security advisor did not share or store any information unlawfully.\"The underlying facts in this case were investigated and resolved years ago,\" Lowell said in a statement Thursday.Bolton in his own statement said he was being targeted because of his opposition to Trump.The charges, he said, are about Trump's \"intensive effort to intimidate his opponents, to ensure that he alone determines what is said about his conduct.\"",

    "body": "watch nowDespite worries over bad loans at midsize U.S. banks, there's little evidence of a systemic problem, according to a senior analyst at Moody's Ratings.Marc Pinto, the agency's head of global private credit, acknowledged in a interview on CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" that there are concerns over loose lending standards and some slack in the conditions that institutions attach to loans.However, he said when looking at the system as a whole, contagion the likes that could trigger a broader financial crisis is not evident.\"When we dig deeper here and look to see if there's a turn in the credit cycle, which is effectively what the market seems to be focusing on, we can find no evidence,\" Pinto said. \"Now that's what we're seeing today. That could always change. But if we look at the asset quality numbers that we've seen over the last several quarters, we're seeing very little deterioration at all.\"Bank stocks sold off aggressively across the board Thursday after Zions and Bancorp and Western Alliance Bancorp disclosed holding bad loans related to the bankruptcies of two auto lenders. The worries have dragged down shares of investment bank Jefferies this month since it disclosed some exposure to bankrupt auto parts maker First Brands.Losses swept across the sector Thursday as worries grew that the danger could be more widespread. JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon raised some eyebrows earlier this week when he said on the bank's earnings conference call that \"when you see one cockroach, there are probably more.\"\"One cockroach does not a trend make,\" Pinto said.In fact, Pinto said default rates on high-yield debt this year have been relatively low, holding under 5%, and are expected to drift down to below 3% in 2026. By comparison, during the 2008 financial crisis, defaults in high-yield debt were in low double digits.At the same time, the U.S. economy has proven stronger than thought, Pinto added, despite persistent worries about labor market weakness and the impact that President Donald Trump's tariffs might have on inflation and consumer demand.Pinto said he is at a conference this week with about 2,000 bankers \"and one of the words that I keep hearing is resilience.\"\"With respect to GDP growth, we're doing much better than many people thought just six months ago,\" he said. \"So again, the credit conditions, looking at GDP growth as well as an expected decline in interest rates, we feel the credit quality is in a pretty good place today and potentially may improve.\"Market sentiment appeared to improve Friday after a sell-off Thursday.The SPDR S&P Regional Banking exchange-traded fund, which tracks the mid-market leaders, tumbled 6.2% Thursday but rose 2% in premarket trading Friday.",

Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY) (L) brief members of the press during a news conference on the government shutdown at the U.S. Capitol on October 16, 2025 in Washington, DC. Alex Wong | Getty ImagesCapitol Hill remains locked in a stalemate as the government shutdown trudges into its third week — and Democrats say their lack of trust in President Donald Trump is a major obstacle to negotiations.In past legislative disputes, bipartisan coalitions known as \"gangs\" have formed to break the logjams. The groups have helped lay the early framework for major deals before getting buy-in from leadership and other lawmakers.In the current funding lapse — which is already longer than most previous government shutdowns — those gangs are nowhere to be found.\"What good is an agreement by a gang of four or eight or 12, when the president of the United States regards himself as his own law and disregards the norms and rules?\" Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., told CNBC.There have been some bipartisan talks around Democrats' key demand: an extension of enhanced premium tax credits for Affordable Care Act health insurance premiums, which are set to expire at year's end.But no specific group has convened to hash out those details, or more broadly negotiate an end to the shutdown.Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., who supports extending the tax credits, said he's had conversations with multiple Democratic senators, but no set group has formed.Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., holds up the continuing resolution to fund the government during a news conference with Speaker of the House Mike Johnson, R-La., on the shutdown in the U.S. Capitol on Friday, Oct. 10, 2025. Tom Williams | CQ-Roll Call, Inc. | Getty Images\"What's different about this is I don't sense any coalescing,\" Hawley said. \"There doesn't seem to be any sort of momentum around people saying, like, 'OK, really, we need to make a deal.'\"Trump, Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., and Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., have maintained that no negotiations can happen until the government has reopened. They need support from around eight Senate Democrats to pass a stopgap bill that will temporarily resume federal funding at current levels.Thune told MSNBC on Wednesday that he has offered Democratic leaders a vote on extending the Obamacare subsidies in exchange for opening the government.But Democrats have expressed strong doubts about any handshake deal with Republicans.\"We need an ironclad path forward that decisively addresses the Republican health-care crisis.\" House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., said Thursday on MSNBC's \"Morning Joe.\"\"They can't be trusted on a wing and a prayer,\" Jeffries said.Read more CNBC government shutdown coverageBill to fund military during government shutdown fails in Senate procedural voteGovernment shutdown: Senate bill fails for 10th time, Kelly tells Trump to get involvedJudge blocks Trump from firing federal workers during government shutdown for nowKristi Noem's shutdown airport video may violate Hatch Act, Sen.

A bipartisan immigration reform proposal introduced last year, for instance, collapsed after Trump publicly opposed it.Some Democrats are now calling on Trump to participate in negotiations himself.\"They seem to follow his lead on everything,\" Sen. Mark Kelly, D-Ariz., said of his GOP colleagues on CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" on Thursday.\"That's the way this ends,\" Kelly said.Further eroding trust is the Trump administration's willingness to cancel billions of dollars in funding approved by a bipartisan group of lawmakers, Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., told reporters.\"There's been a loss of trust between Senate Democrats and the Administration and the House because of what's happened over the last six to nine months in terms of respecting bipartisan spending bills that were signed into law last year,\" Coons said.Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, accused Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., of avoiding negotiations in order to appease progressives in his party, who excoriated him after he previously voted to fund the government in March.\"I think he's afraid to reach some sort of deal like we typically do in these circumstances, because he'll be attacked by his progressive, radical base,\" Cornyn said of Schumer.Schumer was part of the \"Gang of Eight\" that helped pass a bipartisan immigration reform bill in the Senate in 2013.Hawley said Democrats were comfortable keeping the standoff going.\"I just think that folks seem to be pretty content, particularly Democrats, with leaving the government shut down,\" he said.Democrats have a reason to feel secure, at least for now: multiple polls show more Americans are blaming Republicans for the shutdown.The latest CNBC All-America Economic Survey found that 53% of respondents would blame Trump, congressional Republicans or both if the shutdown caused significant economic harm, versus 37% who would blame Democrats.The survey, which polled 1,000 adults nationwide from Oct. 8-12, carries a margin of error of plus or minus 3.1%.",

    "body": "Boeing 737 Max aircraft are assembled at the company’s plant in Renton, Washington, U.S. June 25, 2024.Jennifer Buchanan | Via ReutersBoeing has won regulator approval to ramp up production of its best-selling 737 Max jetliners to 42 a month, a milestone for the manufacturer nearly two years after the Federal Aviation Administration capped its output after a midair near-catastrophe.In January 2024, the FAA restricted Boeing to building the planes at a rate of no more than 38 a month — though it had been below that level at the time — after a door plug from a nearly new 737 Max 9 blew off from an Alaska Airlines flight as it climbed out of Portland, Oregon.Boeing failed to reinstall key bolts on the door plug before it left the factory, a National Transportation Safety Board report found. The 737 Max returned and landed safely, but it put the company back into crisis mode just as leaders were expecting a turnaround year.The FAA said Friday that it would still oversee Boeing's production. \"FAA safety inspectors conducted extensive reviews of Boeing's production lines to ensure that this small production rate increase will be done safely,\" the agency said in a statement.Boeing said it would work with its suppliers to increase production.\"We appreciate the work by our team, our suppliers and the FAA to ensure we are prepared to increase production with safety and quality at the forefront,\" Boeing said Friday in a statement.Read more CNBC airline newsAir traffic control shortages add to U.S. flight delays, FAA saysSpirit Airlines on track for a $475 million bankruptcy lifeline'Seconds count': Avoiding airplane collisions at airports could come down to cockpit alertsU.S. startup airline Breeze Airways plans first international flightsAn increase in output is key to the company's turnaround after years of problems, since airlines and other customers pay for the bulk of an aircraft when they receive it. CEO Kelly Ortberg, named last year to stabilize the top U.S. manufacturer, said last month he expected to soon win FAA approval to raise output to 42, with other increases planned for down the line.\"We'll go from 42 and then we'll go up another five, and we'll go up another five,\" Ortberg told a Morgan Stanley investor conference in September. \"We'll get to where that inventory is more balanced with the supply chain, probably around the 47 a month production rate.\"The change shows the FAA's softening tone and increased confidence in Boeing after years of restrictions. Last month, the agency said it would allow Boeing to again sign off on some of its aircraft itself before they're handed over to customers, instead of that responsibility falling solely with the FAA.The Max program was crippled following two crashes of the planes in 2018 and 2019, which killed all 346 people on the two flights. The aircraft was grounded for nearly two years. Covid also hurt production, followed by supply chain problems and, last year, a labor strike at Boeing's main factories in the Seattle area.Boeing hasn't posted an annual profit since 2018. But it has increased output, and its deliveries of new planes are on track to hit the highest rate since that year.Boeing is scheduled to release quarterly results on Oct. 29.— CNBC's Phil LeBeau and Meghan Reeder contributed to this report.",

    "body": "Elon Musk, CEO of SpaceX and Tesla, attends the Viva Technology conference at the Porte de Versailles exhibition center in Paris on June 16, 2023.Gonzalo Fuentes | ReutersTop proxy advisor Institutional Shareholder Services is recommending that Tesla investors vote against a pay plan for CEO Elon Musk that would grant him nearly $1 trillion more in stock.The \"mega performance equity award\" to Musk, designed to retain the CEO long-term, \"has an astronomical grant value conditioned upon far-reaching performance targets that, if achieved, would create enormous value for shareholders,\" ISS wrote on Friday.Tesla's 2025 annual shareholder meeting and proxy vote is scheduled for Nov. 5. The company is scheduled to report third-quarter results on Wednesday. ISS said that while some shareholders may support the pay plan, \"there are unmitigated concerns surrounding the special award's magnitude and design.\"Musk's plan, if approved, would be the largest ever awarded to a public company CEO. It could could net Musk up to an additional 12% stake in Tesla, should the company hit a market cap of $8.5 trillion and achieve other goals.Tesla disagreed with the ISS recommendations.In a post on X, which is owned by Musk, the automaker accused ISS of missing \"fundamental points of investing and governance,\" and complained that the advisors had previously \"recommended against compensation that shareholders have voted on twice before (and that Elon has already earned), as well as the 2025 CEO Performance Award (where Elon receives nothing unless shareholders win big).\"The company urged shareholders to vote with the board's recommendations on all proposals on the 2025 proxy.ISS previously advised investors to reject a \"ratification\" of Musk's 2018 CEO pay package, which was worth an estimated $56 billion at the time.The Delaware Court of Chancery ruled early last year that the 2018 pay plan had been improperly granted by the Tesla board and must be rescinded. The ruling said Tesla hid crucial details from shareholders that they were entitled to before voting, and that Musk had controlled the board.Musk has appealed that court's decision to the Delaware State Supreme Court, with opening arguments in the appeal heard by a panel of judges this week.Representatives for ISS declined to comment beyond the report.ISS, along with Glass Lewis and smaller peers, can influence how shareholders decide to cast their votes at annual elections. Musk accused ISS and Glass Lewis in 2023 of effectively controlling the stock market because of their influence with passive or index funds in some matters. He also baselessly compared ISS to a terrorist organization.Musk will be able to vote his own shares in the vote concerning his future pay. He holds at least 13.5% of Tesla's voting power, according to the most recent available disclosures on his stake. Those holdings alone could be enough to secure approval for the nearly $1 trillion pay package.In September, Musk added to his ownership of Tesla stock buying another $1 billion worth of shares.Among other ISS recommendations, the firm also suggested that shareholders should vote against giving Tesla's board authorization to invest in xAI, the AI company that Musk started in March 2023 but only disclosed publicly in July that year. Tesla has sold tens of millions of dollars worth of its Megapack battery energy storage systems to xAI.ISS also recommended against voting to reinstate Tesla board member Ira Ehrenpreis, a longstanding and close friend of Musk.In May, Tesla changed its corporate bylaws to limit shareholders' ability to sue for a breach of fiduciary duties so that only a shareholder that owns at least 3% of the company's stock can bring what's called a \"derivative\" action. Ehrenpreis presided over Tesla's governance committee at the time that change was made without a shareholder vote.WATCH: Former Tesla board member says it's hard to argue with valuationwatch now",

The tool allows users to create AI-generated short videos using a text prompt. Sora head Bill Peebles said the tool amassed over 1 million downloads in less than five days, hitting the milestone faster than ChatGPT.Its ascent and the rise of AI-generated videos have also raised questions and concerns over the spread of misinformation, copyright infringement and the proliferation of AI slop — a term used to refer to quickly produced videos that flood social feeds.watch now",

    "body": "watch nowOracle's extended rally, which has been driven by the company's increasingly central position in the artificial intelligence boom, hit pause on Friday, with the stock tumbling 7%, its worst day since January.The slide came a day after the software company revealed a long-term outlook, boosted by AI, at an analysts' meeting that was part of the Oracle AI World conference in Las Vegas.Oracle said on Thursday that it expects $166 billion in cloud infrastructure revenue in the 2030 fiscal year, up from $18 billion in fiscal 2026. The company now sees $21 in adjusted earnings per share on $225 billion in total revenue in fiscal 2030, which represents annualized sales growth of over 31%.The initial reaction was positive. Oracle shares rose 3.1% on Thursday, continuing a rally that's boosted the company's market cap by more than 160% in two years.But a hint of skepticism emerged on Friday, with some analysts questioning Oracle's ability to reach its lofty targets.\"It feels like the stock may take a bit of a breather here as investors digest those numbers and try to get comfort around the achievability of long-term numbers,\" Rishi Jaluria, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets, told CNBC's Seema Mody in an email. Jaluria recommends holding the stock.Oracle didn't respond to a request for comment.Read more CNBC tech newsBenioff's backing of Trump, troops in SF leads Salesforce Foundation director Conway to quitRay-Ban maker EssilorLuxottica says Meta smart glasses are boosting growthChinese robotaxi company Pony.ai to work with Stellantis on Europe expansionSpotify moves further into AI music with Sony, Universal, Warner partnershipOracle has emerged as one of the biggest beneficiaries of the AI infrastructure boom. It recently announced a five-year deal with OpenAI, worth more than $300 billion, to provide access to AI chips. Following its earnings report in September, the stock had its best day since 1992 as the company said it had $455 billion in remaining performance obligations, up 359% from a year earlier.On Thursday, Oracle confirmed that it had a cloud deal with Meta, and said it signed up $65 billion in cloud infrastructure commitments in the current quarter. Oracle also said that its adjusted gross margins on AI infrastructure would be between 30% and 40%, higher than some analysts had expected.Karl Keirstead, an analyst at UBS, raised his price target to $380 from $360 in a note on Friday, and said the stock price doesn't reflect the entire upside of the company's AI-powered acceleration. The shares closed on Friday at $291.31.While he recommends buying the stock, Keirstead noted several things that \"more cautious voices\" will look at in his \"bear case\" scenario. They include the risk of concentrating business with OpenAI and \"various unforeseen go-live bottlenecks\" that could come with such an aggressive buildout, he wrote.Oracle's tone remains extremely optimistic. Clay Magouyrk, who was named one of Oracle's two CEOs last month, said at the conference that this quarter's commitments have come \"across seven different contracts from four different customers.\"\"None of those customers are OpenAI,\" Magouyrk said. \"I know some people are questioning sometimes, 'Hey, is it just OpenAI?' The reality is, we think OpenAI is a great customer, but we have many customers.\"WATCH: Oracle's cloud could catch upwatch now",

    "body": "Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff apologized on Friday for making comments in support of President Donald Trump potentially sending federal troops to San Francisco, where his company is based. \"Having listened closely to my fellow San Franciscans and our local officials, and after the largest and safest Dreamforce in our history, I do not believe the National Guard is needed to address safety in San Francisco,\" Benioff wrote in a post on X.The Trump administration recently deployed the National Guard to Portland, Oregon and Chicago, sparking protests and lawsuits and resulting in citizens and immigrants being detained without legal representation.In a story published late last week in The New York Times, Benioff indicated that he would welcome troops to San Francisco. The company's annual Dreamforce conference was held in downtown San Francisco from Tuesday through Thursday of this week.\"We don't have enough cops, so if they can be cops, I'm all for it,\" Benioff told the Times.Benioff faced blowback for his comments from local politicians and other leaders. California Governor Gavin Newsom and San Francisco politicians on Wednesday issued statements and held press conferences to deliver the message that federal troops are not welcome in the city, and that crime is coming down.Prominent startup investor Ron Conway, who backed companies including Google, Airbnb and Stripe, resigned from the board of the Salesforce Foundation on Thursday. According to the New York Times, Conway told Benioff in an email that their \"values were no longer aligned.\" Conway is a longtime Democratic donor who was a member of VCs for Kamala, and donated around $500,000 to at least two funds tied to Kamala Harris' unsuccessful 2024 election campaign. While Benioff has donated to members of both parties, he has supported Democrats for president, including Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton and Kamala Harris.Venture capitalist David Sacks, who is now Trump's AI and crypto czar, said after the news about Conway that Benioff could join the Republicans. On Tuesday, Sacks, a longtime friend and associate of Elon Musk, was featured with Benioff in an onstage interview at Dreamforce. \"Dear Marc @Benioff, if the Democrats don't want you, we would be happy for you to join our team,\" Sacks wrote on X. \"Cancel culture is over, and we are the inclusive party.\"Following Benioff's initial comment to the Times, Benioff appeared to walk back his comments, writing on X that safety is \"first and foremost, the responsibility of our city and state leaders.\" However, by that point,  Musk and other right-wing figures had seized on his original comments, amplifying them to their audiences.Musk, who has drawn criticism for his personal drug use, characterized downtown San Francisco as a \"drug zombie apocalypse.\" And on Wednesday, Trump called San Francisco \"a mess,\" and suggested possibly sending in the National Guard.\"My earlier comment came from an abundance of caution around the event, and I sincerely apologize for the concern it caused,\" Benioff wrote in his Friday post. \"It's my firm belief that our city makes the most progress when we all work together in a spirit of partnership.\"Opposition to Benioff's initial suggestion also came from Garry Tan, CEO of startup incubator Y Combinator. He wrote on X that \"We don't need the National Guard,\" but he used his post to go after liberal local officials and judges perceived as too lenient.— CNBC's Lora Kolodny contributed to this report.

    "body": "watch nowShares of Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk dropped Friday, after President Donald Trump said his administration aims to cut the cost of brand name GLP-1 weight loss drugs to $150 per month, a fraction of their current list price.\"In London, you'd buy a certain drug for $130 and even less than that ... $88 as of... a month ago. And in New York, you pay $1,300 for the same thing,\" Trump said during a Thursday afternoon event about in vitro fertilization at the White House. \"Instead of $1,300 you'll be paying about $150 and they'll be paying $150 so we're going to pay the same thing.\"Asked by a reporter what drug he was referring to, Trump replied, \"I was referring to Ozempic or ... the fat loss drug.\"At that point, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Administrator Dr. Mehmet Oz interjected and stressed that the administration has not yet agreed to GLP-1 price reductions with drugmakers.\"We have not negotiated those yet ... We're going to be rolling these out over time, the GLP category of drugs, which includes Ozempic have not been negotiated yet,\" Oz said.Just a week ago, Oz had said that the administration was \"in the middle of a lot of action\" with price discussions with weight loss drugmakers.watch nowEli Lilly shares closed 2% lower Friday, while Novo Nordisk's stock fell 3% in U.S. trading. Meanwhile, shares of Hims & Hers Health — which sells much cheaper compounded GLP-1s — plunged more than 15%.Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk were among 17 of the largest U.S. pharmaceutical companies that received letters from the Trump administration following the president's executive order on so-called most-favored nation pricing, demanding that businesses bring U.S. drug prices in line with those in other developed nations.Pfizer and AstraZeneca have signed on to the president's initiative, striking drug pricing deals with the administration. But Trump and Oz's comments make it clear the administration is looking to get the weight loss drugmakers on board.$150 GLP-1 would be cheaper than compoundersWhile demand for weight loss drugs has grown, price has remained an obstacle for consumers and employers.Only about one in five large employers currently offer GLP-1s for weight loss, according to a new survey from the Kaiser Family Foundation. Of those who do, two-thirds say the high cost drugs have had a \"significant\" impact on their prescription drug spending.Workers who don't get coverage through health insurance have increasingly turned to the cash market to buy the drugs on their own.Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk sell discounted versions of their diabetes and weight loss medications on their direct-to-consumer sites at roughly $500 a month. Telehealth providers like Hims & Hers offer compounded versions of GLP-1s for less than half that price, anywhere between $130 to $200 per month.If the administration could bring the cash price for popular weight loss drugs like Lilly's Zepbound and Novo Nordisk's Wegovy down to $150, that would be competitive with compounded options and could have a major impact on the current cash market.",

    "body": "President Donald Trump listens during a Cabinet meeting at the White House on April 30, 2025 in Washington, DC. Andrew Harnik | Getty ImagesViresh Varma can't sleep. The CEO of AV Universal Corp., a small footwear company that sells through retailers like Macy's, Nordstrom and DSW, said he needed to take out a $250,000 loan to pay his tariff bill on a container of shoes he imported from India for the holiday shopping season. Varma didn't have the cash on hand to pay the duties, which he said used to be around $7,500 for a similar-sized container before President Donald Trump's new tariffs. But without the financing, he wouldn't have anything to sell during the holidays.So the 64-year-old said he was faced with a choice: take on the line of credit— which came with onerous terms like weekly payments and a 32% interest rate — and raise prices to pay it back, or close the business he's spent the last nine years building. He decided to take out the loan.\"Everybody believes that I'm a fighter, so I'm fighting it,\" Varma told CNBC in an interview. \"We've reduced some salaries. We had planned to hire some people we're not going to hire anymore. … If things don't look good, especially after increasing the prices, and we don't get the sales, then obviously we may lay off some people, as well.\" AV Universal is just one of the many small businesses that are buckling under Trump's global trade war, struggling to pay the sudden increase in duties and forecast what's ahead as policy evolves. Businesses of all sizes have raised prices and negotiated with vendors to weather the tariff storm and many larger retailers have so far proven resilient, with minimal impact to their profitability and future growth outlooks. Better-than-expected quarterly reports have led investors to largely shrug off the tariff threat, as the S&P 500 hovers near record highs.But the higher costs have hit smaller companies harder because they have fewer levers to pull than their larger competitors. Their margins are slimmer, their supply chains less diverse and their negotiating power with vendors dampened by the smaller sizes of their orders.Small businesses owners interviewed by CNBC said they largely expect to be able to manage higher costs from tariffs by raising prices, but only if it doesn't cause shoppers to buy less — which most are already starting to see.Often called the backbone of the U.S. economy, small businesses routinely represent more than 40% of the nation's GDP and employ nearly half of the American workforce, according to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. Trump says his tariffs allow the U.S. to reduce its trade deficits with other nations and encourage domestic manufacturing, but some of the small business owners who spoke to CNBC said that's happening partially at their expense.The struggles they're facing could be a warning sign for the rest of the economy and bigger businesses in 2026, said Kent Smetters, a professor of business economics and public policy at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School.\"The small businesses … they're kind of like the canary in the coal mine here,\" said Smetters, the faculty director of the Penn Wharton Budget Model. \"They're going to get hit first, and then I think you're going to see more of an impact with some delay on larger businesses.\" Larger retailers have been able to manage higher tariff costs in part because they had the foresight and ability to order extra inventory before the new duties went into effect, said Smetters. At a certain point, that stock will run out and push costs higher, and those companies only have so many low-tariff countries where they can produce goods.The fate of many of Trump's tariffs is unclear after a federal court ruled them illegal, prompting an appeal from the White House that the Supreme Court is now reviewing. The nation's highest court, which includes three Trump appointees and has a 6-3 conservative majority, agreed to hear the appeal on a faster-than-normal timeline with arguments scheduled for the first week of November. It's unclear how fast the justices will issue a ruling, and the tariffs remain in effect during the appeal.CNBC spoke with around a dozen business owners to better understand how tariffs are affecting them. Here's how much the duties are costing some of those companies — and what the businesses are doing to offset them.AV Universal Corp.Total tariffs paid in 2024: $45,000Total tariffs expected in 2025: $353,125Employees: 10Supply chain: India 80%, Vietnam 15%, Europe 5% Varma, AV's CEO, spent much of his career in corporate America before deciding to get into the footwear business about a decade ago. He built three brands from scratch that are now sold online by Amazon, Macy's, DSW, Nordstrom and other retailers. Varma was in the process of sending orders for the 2025 holiday season — which typically accounts for about 40% of AV's annual revenue — when Trump announced tariffs on dozens of trading partners on April 2.Thinking the president was bluffing, Varma placed an order for 20,000 pairs of shoes from his manufacturer in India, but ultimately only shipped half because he couldn't line up the financing necessary to pay the expected tariff bill on the entire order. Varma expects holiday sales to drop about 30% because he'll have less inventory to sell, but that decline could get worse if consumers balk at the higher prices he implemented. Since he increased prices earlier this year, sales fell about 30% in August and September.Varma has searched across the globe to escape the Trump administration's 50% tariff on Indian goods and is now considering moving his manufacturing to China, as long as Trump walks back his latest threat to raise tariffs on Chinese imports to 100%.Talus ProductsTotal tariffs paid in 2024: ~$223,000*Total tariffs expected in 2025: ~$499,000*Employees: 9Supply chain: primarily China  *The figures are adjusted for order volumeTalus Products co-founder and CEO David McClees (middle left) pictured with his team during the holidays. HandoutDavid McClees, co-founder and CEO of Talus Products, opened his business 38 years ago with a single product: an inflatable travel pillow. The company has since expanded into a range of items, including car organizers and other travel accessories, that it distributes through retailers like The Container Store, Amazon and airport gift shops. McClees said he's not worried about having to shut down operations, but said he expects tariffs to put a \"severe crimp\" in his annual profitability. The company raised prices on certain products to offset tariffs, but is waiting until January to hike again, partially over concerns it could dampen consumer demand during the holiday shopping season. Sales on Amazon, which account for more than half of Talus' revenue, have already been \"soft\" in recent weeks, he said.\"We're nervous,\" said McClees. \"We don't typically offer huge discounts on Prime Day, but we do see a bump from their increased traffic, and that was smaller than what we would normally see. It seems like buyers are being very cautious.\" McClees attempted to move some of Talus' production to Mexico and Vietnam, but said he ultimately decided it was too expensive.Village LightingTotal tariffs paid in 2024: less than $50,000Total tariffs expected in 2025: at least $1 million Employees: between 11 and 17, depending on seasonSupply chain: 50% spread across Vietnam, Cambodia, Indonesia, Myanmar and Thailand, the other 50% in China  Village Lighting CEO Jared Hendricks (center, pictured in white) with his wife, children and son-in-law. HandoutJared Hendricks, founder and CEO of Village Lighting, started his business 20 years ago making Christmas lighting and decorations before expanding into holiday storage, selling directly to consumers via his website and through big-box stores like Walmart and Target. Since his business is centered around the holidays, his buying and cash flow needs are unique compared with others in the retail industry.Every year, just before Christmas, he said he uses a $2 million line of credit he took out against his home to buy the inventory he needs for the following year's holiday and then uses that eventual revenue to pay back the debt. This year, he had to use that line of credit to pay his tariff bill.\"Hopefully I can turn around and mark things up enough for people to buy them from me so I can pay back my tariff debt,\" said Hendricks. \"It's to the point now where it could kill us, it could take us down, and I could lose everything. I can't afford to not bring stuff in because I'll have nothing to sell. So that's a game over scenario.\"Because of Village Lighting's unique buying schedule, the company had to take a loss on about 40% of its annual sales because the orders and pricing were already contractually agreed upon when many of the new duties went into effect. Hendricks said he hopes to make it up by raising prices on his website and wholesale customers. Sales so far this season have been down between 8% and 10% and he owes millions of dollars to his suppliers, who have agreed to accept late payments. Hendricks said the situation has created massive stress for him and his wife, adding that the challenges the Covid-19 pandemic posed to his business feel like \"a piece of cake\" compared with now.\"I call them my demons. They're my two or three o'clock in the morning demons, where they just wake me up in a panic, like, 'how am I going to pay for this? Or how am I going to make this work? What have I done? Should I have quit last April and just cashed in?'\" said Hendricks. \"Being a small business owner isn't worth it when your country turns on you.\" Picnic TimeTotal tariffs paid in 2024: $950,000Total tariffs expected in 2025: $2.25 millionEmployees: 75Supply chain: 85%-90% in China, the remainder in India Picnic Time CEO Paul Cosaro, shown in a gray shirt, with his family outside of the company's headquarters. HandoutPaul Cosaro's family business, Picnic Time, was started 43 years ago by his father, an Italian immigrant on a mission to sell high-quality picnic baskets. The company now sells a wide range of products, from coolers to beach chairs, to major retailers like Kohl's, Target and Macy's. Since Trump's new tariffs went into effect, Picnic Time had to freeze hiring and capital expenditures, limiting its ability to produce and release new products, Cosaro said.\"It absolutely has stifled innovation,\" he said. \"You don't want to take risks anymore ... there's no room for error.\"Cosaro said he attempted to move his supply chain to other countries during Trump's first term, hiring additional staff and conducting sourcing missions in India and Mexico. But years later, he was only able to move about 10% of production. He said he raised his prices earlier this year to account for the new tariffs and the third quarter has so far been \"very, very, very soft.\" Sales are down about 20% and key retailers have pulled back on orders. The holiday season is always important to Picnic Time, as it accounts for about 35% of annual revenue, but this year it feels like the company is putting \"all of our eggs in one basket,\" said Cosaro.\"For us, it's critically important,\" he said. \"We're literally going to be waiting until the last day of the year to find out if this is going to be a profitable year or not.\" For now, Cosaro said he will keep his supply chain primarily in China. He's considered moving some of it to the U.S., but said he doesn't have the budget available to take the risk. CitibinTotal tariffs paid in 2024: $67,883Total tariffs expected in 2025: $380,000Employees: 8Supply chain: 90% Vietnam, 5% China, 5% U.S. Frank Picarazzi, the chief operating officer of Citibin (left) with his wife Liz Picarazzi, the company's founder and CEO (right).Courtesy: Frank PicarazziWhen Liz Picarazzi first started Citibin, which makes rat-proof trash enclosures for cities, parks and homes, the company manufactured in the U.S. After a few years, she said she found U.S. producers couldn't meet her expectations on price, quality or lead time. She moved production to China and for several years, the business enjoyed manageable tariffs and reliable partners. However, in the lead-up to the 2024 election, she and her husband Frank Picarazzi, Citibin's COO, started looking for other options over concerns that either candidate would raise tariff rates.\"I told Frank two days after the election, 'we're going to Vietnam, like, as soon as we can,'\" Liz Picarazzi said.The couple spent the next few months moving most of their production to Vietnam, only to learn of Trump's decision to raise tariffs on all aluminum and steel imports to 50%. That raised costs for just about every product Citibin sells. Though her supply chain is now more diversified, Liz Picarazzi said that moving to Vietnam was \"somewhat pointless\" as a result.Meanwhile, she said higher costs are affecting talent retention, research and development, and revenue. The company has added a 15% tariff surcharge to products to offset the cost of tariffs. Frank Picarazzi said it has contributed to a 25% decline in sales to homeowners, which the company expects will account for about 50% of overall revenue this year. Reekon ToolsTotal tariffs paid in 2024: $65,000Total tariffs expected in 2025: more than $400,000Employees: 20Supply chain: Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam and China Christian Reed, founder and CEO of Reekon Tools, on a job site holding the T1R Hybrid Laser Tape MeasureHandoutResearch and development is critical for Christian Reed's tool startup Reekon. He said the company had to cut back R&D spending by 20% because of tariffs.\"This certainly put a thorn in the side of our hiring plan for the rest of the year around engineers for R&D activities,\" said Reed. \"That's something that will continue to have to either be paused or completely canceled if nothing changes.\"The hundreds of thousands of dollars Reed planned to use to hire between three and five designers and engineers is now going to tariffs instead, he said. The company, which makes innovative products like digital tape measures for tradespeople, needs to ensure every tool it produces is effective and able to withstand tough conditions on worksites.\"There's a unique combination of making a product that you can feed up, throw on the concrete, you know, slam around and not break, and at the same time add this digital aspect,\" said Reed. \"So that puts a very high burden on the testing, the research we have to do … it's a very costly product as most of the products we're making are new to [the] world.\"Reed said he's avoided raising prices on most items, choosing to take the hit to profit margins, but recently increased the price of a new tool – a smaller version of its digital tape measure. Initially, Reekon wanted to price it at $99 and while the margins would've been slim, the company expected to be able to make it up in volume, Reed said. However, after tariff rates rose, the company priced it at $119 when it launched in September to help it offset losses in other parts of the business. While the product has been well received, sales so far have fallen short of the company's projections. ",

    "body": "watch nowBig banks including JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs had just finished taking victory laps after a blockbuster quarter when concerns emerged from an obscure corner of Wall Street, sending a collective shiver through global finance.Regional bank Zions late Wednesday disclosed a near total wipeout on $60 million in loans after finding \"apparent misrepresentations\" from the borrowers. The next day, peer Western Alliance said that it had sued the same borrower, a commercial real estate firm called the Cantor Group, for alleged fraud.The result was a sudden and deep selloff among regional banks, drawing comparisons to the churn of the 2023 banking crisis that consumed Silicon Valley Bank and First Republic. This time around, investors are focused on a specific type of lending made by banks to non-depository financial institutions, or NDFIs, as the source of possible contagion.\"When you see one cockroach, there are probably more,\" JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon said this week. \"Everyone should be forewarned on this one.\"Concerns over credit quality had been simmering for weeks after the September collapse of two U.S. auto-related companies. JPMorgan, the biggest U.S. bank by assets, this week reported a $170 million loss tied to one of them, the subprime auto lender Tricolor.But it wasn't until a third case of alleged fraud around loans made to NDFIs that investors were jolted into fearing the worst, according to Truist banking analyst Brian Foran.\"You now have had three situations where there was alleged fraud\" involving NDFIs, Foran said.Dimon's comments \"really resonated with people who were like, 'Oh, man, the tide went out a little bit, and now we're seeing who was lacking their swim trunks,\" Foran said.watch nowWhat are NDFIs?The episode cast a spotlight on a fast-growing category of loans made by regional banks and global investment banks alike. Rules put into place after the 2008 financial crisis discouraged regulated banks from making many types of loans, from mortgages to subprime auto, leading to the rise of thousands of non-bank lenders.Moving riskier activities outside of the regulated bank perimeter, where failures are backstopped by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, seemed like a good move.But it turns out, banks are a major source of funding for non-bank lenders: commercial loans to NDFIs reached $1.14 trillion as of March, per the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.Bank loans made to non-bank financial firms were the single fastest-growing category, rising 26% annually since 2012, according to the St. Louis Fed.\"The surge in NDFI lending was really because all these different regulations added up to say there are a bunch of loans banks can't do anymore, but if they lend to someone else who does them, that's OK,\" Foran said.\"We really don't know much about these NDFI books,\" Foran said. \"People are saying, 'I didn't know it was so easy for a bank to think they had $50 million in collateral and find out they had zero.'\"'Overreaction' or early?Part of what's spooking investors is that, while some of the loan losses disclosed have been relatively small, they've been near total wipeouts, said KBW bank analyst Catherine Mealor.\"NDFI lending, because of the collateral involved, typically has a higher loss rate, and the losses can come very quickly and out of nowhere,\" Mealor said. \"It's really hard to wrap your mind around these risks.\"Mealor said investors have been inundating her with questions around the level of NDFI exposures in her coverage universe, the analyst said. Firms including Western Alliance and Axos Financial are among those with the highest proportion of NDFI loans, according to an August research note from Janney Montgomery.Still, regional banks are benefitting from an improving interest rate environment and rising mergers activity, which underpin valuations, Mealor said, adding she thinks this week's stock selloff was an \"overreaction.\"\"You want to avoid companies that show up high in the screen for NDFI loans,\" she said. \"There are plenty of high-quality companies in the KRX that are trading at a massive discount.\"Correction: This article has been updated to remove an incorrect mention of losses at one of the regional banks tied to the alleged loan fraud.

    "body": "watch nowElectricity companies across the U.S. are struggling to figure out how much demand will actually materialize from the artificial intelligence boom, as the stock market speculates that vast sums of money will be spent on infrastructure to support a big data center buildout.\"There is a question about whether or not all of the projections, if they're real,\" Willie Phillips, who served as chairman of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission from 2023 until April 2025, told CNBC. \"There are some regions who have projected huge increases, and they have readjusted those back.\"The AI companies are rolling out ambitious plans to build server farms that in some cases would consume as much electricity as entire cities. But the tech industry is shopping the same big projects around to multiple utilities as they look for the quickest access to power.\"We're starting to see similar projects that look exactly to have the same footprint being requested in different regions across the country,\" GridUnity CEO Brian Fitzsimons told CNBC. GridUnity uses software to give utilities and transmission operators a clearer picture of where power projects are requesting connections across the patchwork U.S. electric grid.This data center shopping is making it difficult for utilities to determine how much power generation they will need to ensure the reliability of the electric grid. Electricity prices, meanwhile, are rising for consumers because power supply is already struggling to keep pace with demand.FERC Chairman David Rosner warned in September that the difference of a few percentage points in electricity load forecasts \"can impact billions of dollars in investments and customer bills.\"\"Put simply, we cannot efficiently plan the electric generation and transmission needed to serve new customers if we don't forecast how much energy they will need as accurately as possible,\" Rosner said.Constellation Energy CEO Joe Dominguez warned of the problem on the nuclear power operator's May earnings call: \"I just have to tell you, folks, I think the load is being overstated. We need to pump the brakes here.\"AI bubble fearsThe stock market, however, is not really pumping the brakes. The steady pace of big data center announcements is fueling one of the biggest rallies in power company stocks in two decades.The utility sector has gained about 21% this year after rallying more than 19% in 2024. The companies that supply the U.S. with electricity have gained nearly $500 billion in value over that two-year period. The last time utilities advanced more than 40% in consecutive years was in 2003 and 2004.OpenAI CEO Sam Altman warned in August that the stock market is facing an AI bubble, cautioning investors that they were getting \"overexcited.\"While the exact magnitude of the coming demand is uncertain, experts generally agree that the U.S. is facing a historic increase in electricity consumption after a long period of flat growth. Existing data centers point to what is coming, Rob Gramlich, president of Grid Strategies, said.watch now\"We can see it. Data centers exist,\" he said. \"They're operating day in and day out, using a lot of electricity. It used to be the case a 50 megawatt data center was pretty big. Now, it's very common to have data centers that are 20 times that size — that are a gigawatt.\"Grid Strategies, a power sector consulting firm, estimates 120 gigawatts of additional electricity demand by 2030. This includes 60 gigawatts from data centers based on forecasts from the utilities. To put that in perspective, 60 gigawatts is roughly equivalent to the 2024 peak hourly power demand of Italy, the world's eighth-largest economy.\"This is not a bubble,\" Fitzsimons said. \"It's going to transform our nation completely. It's going to continue to grow. We need a 50-year energy policy.\"But the utilities need to get firm financial commitments from the data centers, Gramlich said.\"That is going to help us rationalize all these requests and get a better handle on the total estimate,\" he said. \"But the industry's got to plan based on the best information we have at the moment.\"The uncertainty about demand forecasts has raised concerns that utilities could spend billions of dollars on infrastructure that is not needed in the end. The utilities spent $178 billion on grid upgrades last year and are forecasting $1.1 trillion in capital investments through 2029, according to the Edison Electric Institute.Fitzsimons said the risk of the utilities overbuilding is lower than it was two decades ago due to constraints in the market.\"They're in a very different environment where we have massive supply chain problems,\" Fitzsimons said. \"We have inflation running off the hook for quite a long time now. They can't afford to overbuild. It's going to come down to better planning.\"Infrastructure constraintsA month after warning of a bubble, Altman struck a deal with Nvidia in which OpenAI would build 10 gigawatts of data centers with the chipmaker's graphics processing units. The plan requires as much electricity as New York City during the energy intensive summer days, raising questions about whether they can actually secure the power needed.It may be possible to secure that much electricity but the AI industry is facing constraints as their plans grow larger, Gramlich said. The companies are competing for scarce infrastructure, he said, which is increasing prices for essential electrical equipment like transformers, switches and breakers.\"We really don't have the electrical infrastructure to meet the aggressive targets,\" the analyst said. \"We don't have enough generation or transmission infrastructure to meet even the modest midpoint targets.\"The question is how fast new generation can be built, he said. Natural gas turbines are largely sold out through the end of the decade. The tech industry is investing in advanced nuclear power, but these technologies are not expected to reach commercial scale until the 2030s at the earliest.Renewable energy, meanwhile, can be deployed at the quickest speed, particularly solar and battery storage. More than 90% of the power projects waiting for a grid connection right now are solar, battery storage or wind, according to August data from energy consulting firm Enverus.\"For the past 10 years, our interconnection cues have been filled with a massive percentage of renewables,\" Fitzsimons said. \"The renewables are the fastest way to build out new capacity. There's no doubt in that because of the supply chain issues we have around natural gas turbines.\"But President Donald Trump opposes solar and wind while promoting coal, natural gas and nuclear power, raising uncertainty about whether enough new generation can be built. Utilities will turn data centers away if they do not have enough power available, Gramlich said.\"If they literally do not have the power to serve a customer, they're not going to sacrifice reliability,\" Gramlich said. \"That's their core job.\"Some AI companies believe they have found a solution — just build the power at the data center off the grid, called \"behind the meter\" in industry lingo.\"We should invest in just about every possible way of generating energy,\" Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang told CNBC in an interview on Oct. 8. \"Data center self-generated power could move a lot faster than putting it on the grid and we have to do that,\" he said.",

    "body": "A demo setup of racks of AI servers connected with Credo cables, displayed at the Open Compute Summit in San Jose, California.CredoIn July, Elon Musk posted photos from inside an xAI data center called Colossus 2, which the artificial intelligence startup aims to turn into a massive supercomputing facility in Memphis, Tennessee.Musk's pictures, posted to his X feed, didn't show off the pricey Nvidia racks that are filled with powerful graphics processing units. Rather, he focused on the wires behind the servers, including one image with thousands of neatly organized purple cables connecting the computers together.Those purple cables are the signature offering of Credo, a 17-year-old Silicon Valley-based semiconductor company whose name rarely gets mentioned alongside the leaders of the AI boom.But Wall Street has taken notice.Credo shares have more than doubled this year to $143.61 after soaring 245% in 2024. The company's market cap, which was about $1.4 billion at the time of its IPO in 2022, now sits at close to $25 billion. Credo is angling to position itself as a key supplier in the trillion-dollar AI infrastructure expansion, and is benefiting as the money flows downstream.The stock jumped 5% on Friday after analysts at JPMorgan Chase initiated coverage with the equivalent of a buy rating and a $165 stock price. They said the active electrical cable (AEC) market, which Credo pioneered, is on pace to hit $4 billion by 2028, as all the major hyperscalers invest in data center buildouts.\"The industry outlook is supported by increasing deployments from major companies such as Amazon, Microsoft, and xAI as well as broadening adoption, including Meta and more,\" the analysts wrote. They predict annualized revenue growth for Credo of at least 50% through 2028.watch nowRevenue in fiscal 2025, which ended in early May, more than doubled to $436.8 million. The company also turned profitable, recording net income of $52.2 million after losing $28.4 million the prior year. Analysts are expecting sales to more than double again in fiscal 2026 to almost $1 billion, according to LSEG.Credo's purple AECs cost between $300 and $500 each, depending on bulk discounts and other negotiations, according to an estimate from the 650 Group, an industry researcher. They are sturdy, moderately thick copper cables wrapped in a braided covering with big connectors containing chips on each side.Much of the excitement around Credo is driven by the AI boom, which to this point has been driven by a handful of hyperscalers that are rapidly building data centers for future expected workloads. Analysts expect $1 trillion in spending on AI data centers by 2030, but any pullback from the major cloud providers or scaling back in OpenAI's plans could hurt many suppliers, including Credo.For now, projections are way up and to the right.Expanding opportunityPrevious servers typically had one or two processors on a motherboard. Individual servers today can have up to eight, and the most powerful AI models require potentially millions of GPUs all working together as one.Each GPU needs its own connection to the switch, the term for a computer that routes data around the cluster, often mounted on the top of a server rack.Nvidia's latest products slot several of these boards together to comprise a system with 72 GPUs. Next year's fastest racks will have twice as many, and the following year, a Kyber rack will have 572 GPUs, Nvidia says.\"In the past, Credo's opportunity was one cable per server, but now Credo's opportunity is nine cables per server,\" said Alan Weckel, an analyst at 650 Group. He estimates that Credo has 88% of the market for AECs, which are also made by Astera Labs and Marvell.Many GPUs are connected by fiber optic cables powered by components made by companies like Broadcom and Coherent. AECs offer an alternative to fiber optic cables. They have chips called digital signal processors on both sides that use sophisticated algorithms to pull data out of the cable, enabling much longer lengths than traditional copper cables. Credo's longest AEC is seven meters long.Credo CEO Bill Brennan, who joined the company in 2013, told CNBC that hyperscalers are choosing his company's cables because they're more reliable than fiber optic cables. He said customers are trying to avoid what's called a \"link flap,\" where one part of an AI cluster goes offline because the optical cable connecting them fails, costing hours of pricey GPU time.\"It can literally shut down an entire data center,\" Brennan said.He said Credo is increasingly working with hyperscalers in the early stages of planning large AI clusters, especially as some designs become denser, allowing more servers to be connected by shorter cables.\"When you connect with these hyperscalers, the numbers are very large,\" Brennan said.Credo's AEC leadership team, Hal Hawthorne, Don Barnetson, Ameet Suri, and Ryan Cai.Corey Bentley, CredoThe company doesn't name its hyperscaler clients, but analysts have cited Amazon and Microsoft as customers. Amazon Web Services CEO Matt Garman posted an image on LinkedIn of the company's Trainium AI chip racks on Friday that appeared to show Credo's purple cables.Credo says it expects three or four customers to make up more than 10% of revenue each in the coming quarters, including two new hyperscale customers this year.Amazon and Microsoft declined to comment. Meta and xAI didn't respond to requests for comment.At a conference for data center professionals in San Jose this week, Credo presented alongside a representative from Oracle Cloud. An example rack of Nvidia GPUs designed by Meta displayed at the show prominently featured Credo's purple cables.\"Every time you see a new announcement of a gigawatt data center, you can rest assured that we view that as an opportunity,\" Brennan told investors on an earnings call in September.It's a market that everyone in AI networking is targeting.Analysts at TD Cowen estimated earlier this month that the market for AI networking chips could be worth $75 billion per year by 2030. Major players include Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices, which both have their own networking businesses and have the power to dictate which technologies are part of their broader systems.'Insatiable demand'Credo was founded in 2008 by a group of ex-Marvell engineers, who developed chips for a relatively arcane technology called SerDes, which is used for high-speed chip-to-chip connections.Brennan's job, when he joined in 2013, was to commercialize the technology. The company raised its first round of venture funding in 2015 from investors including Walden International, which was run by Lip-Bu Tan, now Intel's CEO.Christina Locopo | CNBCThe AEC business didn't take off until the AI boom in the early 2020s, because data centers didn't yet need its technology, Brennan said.However, there was early excitement in the air when Musk's car company came knocking in 2017. Tesla wanted help with its Dojo AI supercomputer and needed chips with more bandwidth than what was available at the time.Now, Credo is hoping to use its foothold with its active copper cables to branch out into additional product lines, including intra-rack connections, or what's called \"scale-up\" networking. The company announced new transceivers and software for optical cables this week.\"You've got this market pull like we've never had before,\" Brennan said. \"If you could deliver the next generation right now, it would be consumed. Generation after that, it would be consumed. You've got this insatiable demand from the AI cluster world.\"WATCH: OpenAI in Abilene, Texaswatch now",

I hadn't heard that.\"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said he was \"not happy\" with the idea following Trump's response.Kirill Dmitriev, an investment envoy for Russian President Vladimir Putin, suggested in posts on Musk's social media platform X that the project would be partly funded by Moscow.Dmitriev said it would be \"a 70-mile link symbolizing unity.\"A tunnel like this would traditionally cost an estimated $65 billion to build, said Dmitriev, who is head of Russia's sovereign wealth fund, adding that The Boring Company and its technology could potentially reduce those costs to $8 billion and complete the project within eight years.\"Let's build a future together!\" he wrote.Read more CNBC tech newsBenioff's backing of Trump, troops in SF leads Salesforce Foundation director Conway to quitRay-Ban maker EssilorLuxottica says Meta smart glasses are boosting growthChinese robotaxi company Pony.ai to work with Stellantis on Europe expansionSpotify moves further into AI music with Sony, Universal, Warner partnershipDmitriev's suggestion followed a call between Putin and Trump on Thursday, during which plans were made to discuss possible resolutions to the Ukraine War.Trump said Secretary of State Marco Rubio and other high-level advisors will meet next week with a Russian delegation before Trump and Putin meet in Budapest, Hungary, at a future date.Musk did not respond to a request for comment about the proposal.Construction of an undersea tunnel in the Bering Strait would require Musk's Boring Company to work through below-freezing temperatures in a region without existing infrastructure and with deep and frequent earthquakes.The Boring Company has no track record of working through such conditions.Its previous tunneling efforts were completed in hot, dry locations with plenty of infrastructure and services nearby.The Boring Company was recently fined and cited by environmental regulators in the state of Nevada for an \"extraordinary number of violations,\" ProPublica reported, citing public records. Those violations included: digging without approval, releasing untreated water onto city streets and spilling waste from trucks.The Boring Company is now working on a 10-mile tunnel project from downtown Nashville, Tennessee, to its airport, dubbed the Music City Loop. Residents protested, in part, due to the lack of planning before The Boring Company project was authorized in the flood-prone city.U.S. President Donald Trump (R) walks with Russian President Vladimir Putin as they arrives at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson on August 15, 2025 in Anchorage, Alaska.

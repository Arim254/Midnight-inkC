    "body": "In the U.S., postings for entry-level jobs have declined about 35% since January 2023, per data from labor research firm Revelio Labs.Cemile Bingol | Digitalvision Vectors | Getty ImagesAs more companies brazenly declare AI-driven layoffs in 2025, the first jobs on the chopping block appear to be junior positions and entry-level jobs.Graduate schemes and internships are at risk of becoming a thing of the past as major firms slash headcount in a push to deploy AI. Recently, Amazon laid off 14,000 corporate employees as it aims to invest in its \"biggest bets\" which includes generative AI.Other companies that are leaning on AI and cutting jobs include Accenture, Salesforce, Lufthansa and Duolingo.Now, concerns are mounting over whether AI can do the work of entry-level workers and graduates, thereby raising the barrier for entry.In fact, 62% of U.K. employers expect that junior, clerical, managerial and administrative roles will most likely be lost to AI, according to a new survey of 2,019 senior HR professionals and decision makers by the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development (CIPD.)And further data shows that the number of graduate roles available has declined in the past year. In the U.S., postings for entry-level jobs have declined about 35% since January 2023, per data from labor research firm Revelio Labs.In the U.K., the Institute for Student Employers found in its annual Student Recruitment Survey that just under 17,000 graduate vacancies in the U.K. had received 1.2 million applications highlighting the intense competition and the limited positions available to young people.As companies cut back on hiring junior workers, Fabian Stephany, assistant professor of AI and work at Oxford Internet Institute, pointed out that recruiting entry-level workers is actually an \"investment\" in the future.Although they tend to make mistakes and require hands-on training, experts told CNBC why replacing junior workers with AI will actually backfire on companies in the long-term.'Leadership of the future'Healthy organizations cultivate their own talent and it's not feasible to hire for all positions externally, according to Chris Eldridge, UKI and North America CEO of tech recruitment firm Robert Walters\"If you remove too many junior roles, you can starve the internal talent pipeline,\" Eldridge said.\"Entry-level, junior-level roles are the breeding ground for the leadership of the future. I think if you overcut that junior layer, you will have a talent bottleneck at some point in the business that leads invariably to an increase in hiring costs.\"If a company doesn't have enough young talent, it will be forced to hire from the outside in the future and will create a \"talent doom cycle\" which will result in increased costs, salary inflation, and a dependency on the external talent market.\"I represent a talent consultancy, however, we would advise every organization to have several routes to talent in the market, and one of them is to create your own,\" Eldridge said.\"Also talent retention is very important through the training development and opportunities you can give people… but you're missing a significant aspect of growth if you shut down the pipeline on bringing junior or entry-level talent into an organization,\" he added.'Generational bridge'Companies that don't nurture young talent will eventually lose touch with consumers and mainstream culture, according to Oxford Internet Institute's Stephany.\"A firm is part of society, and if it doesn't reflect society adequately, it's very hard for me to imagine a business model or product that doesn't need this generational bridge…and young people bring in fresh ideas that bring a new perspective,\" Stephany said to CNBC Make It.Firms that fail to adapt and hire junior employees will become \"like an elderly homes company,\" Stephany said. \"It's like a company of soon to be retired people because… they might not have the edge and the vibe that you need to bring in a new product to the market.\"Eldridge agreed noting that there's a stereotype that all good ideas come from the top but \"a very healthy percentage of great ideas in the company come from people within their first two or three years in an organization because they see it with fresh eyes.\"An additional bonus of having young people in an organization is the opportunity for reverse mentoring, particularly as young people bring a crucial knowledge of technology, and losing that would be a \"genuine threat\" to organizations.\"If anything erodes that opportunity for mentorship both ways and that knowledge transfer both ways, it will drive down institutional knowledge or create institutional gaps,\" he said.Matthew Prince, co-founder and CEO of Cloudflare, told CNBC's \"Worldwide Exchange\" last week that the tech firm plans to hire 11,000 interns in the age of AI in order to upskill the next generation but also bring fresh new ideas.\"50-year-old CEOs like myself aren't going to be the ones to teach companies how to take advantage of AI. We need to learn from the next generation,\" Prince said.'Culture carriers'\"Tacit knowledge\" is an important element to keeping an organization healthy, according to Stephany. It refers to the implicit and unspoken information about a company's culture that colleagues' share.\"There are so many things that make a company work that are nowhere to be written down,\" he said. \"They emerge from the network of people, those people that sit sometimes in the cafeteria that say 'I've been with the company for 25 years, I can explain you what what's going on, why X has a problem with Y.\"That's the type of company wisdom of tacit knowledge that's a lubricant for the economic wellbeing of the company,\" he said.Robert Walters' Eldridge added that young people are sponges and \"absorb the best of a business\" including this type of tacit knowledge that can only be passed on through people.\"They're the culture carriers of the future as well so if you're not bringing that cohort in that what does that mean down the road in terms of culture?\"\"I think businesses rely on that upwards pressure, where you bring in a cohort of inexperienced people, they are hungry, they want to learn. They ask an awful lot to organizations, which sometimes test them and keeps a company on its toes. if you don't have that it could potentially end up being a detriment to the culture and to the performance of an organization,\" Eldridge added.",

On Monday, markets are pricing in a 56.1% chance that the Fed stands pat on rates at its next meeting, according to CME Group's FedWatch tool. A month ago, the market had assigned a 95% probability to an end of year cut.Stateside overnight, stock futures were little changed following a choppy week in which valuation fears, a rotation within the market and a recalibration of Federal Reserve rate cut expectations pressured the artificial intelligence trade.Meanwhile, Asia-Pacific markets traded mixed on overnight as investors assessed rising friction between Japan and China after Beijing warned its citizens about travel and study plans in Japan.There are no major European earnings or data releases Monday.— CNBC's Fred Imbert and Lee Ying Shan contributed to this market report.",

    "body": "U.S. President Donald Trump speaks to reporters before boarding Air Force One at Palm Beach International Airport on November 16, 2025. Roberto Schmidt | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesU.S. President Donald Trump on Sunday called on Republicans in Congress to vote to release files related to deceased convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, a sharp reversal from previous resistance within his inner circle.\"House Republicans should vote to release the Epstein files, because we have nothing to hide,\" Trump said in a lengthy post on his Truth Social account. \"And it's time to move on from this Democrat Hoax perpetrated by Radical Left Lunatics in order to deflect from the Great Success of the Republican Party, including our recent Victory on the Democrat 'Shutdown',\" he added. The president went on to say that the Department of Justice has already turned over \"tens of thousands of pages\" to the public on Epstein, and that officials were examining \"various Democrat operatives,\" such as former President Bill Clinton and his former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers.A Clinton spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment, following Trump's late-night Truth Social post.Trump's statement comes as he faces growing pressure regarding his past ties to Epstein, who died by apparent suicide in August 2019 after being arrested on child sex trafficking charges.The full House of Representatives is set to vote on a measure — pushed by Republican representative Thomas Massie and Democrat Ro Khanna — demanding the release of criminal investigative files about Epstein, which is reportedly set to occur on Tuesday.Read more CNBC politics coverageU.S. and Switzerland reach trade deal to lower tariffs to 15%Goldman Sachs stands by top lawyer after her emails with Jeffrey Epstein exposedGovernment shutdown back pay headed to federal workers in coming daysJeffrey Epstein files: House speaker announces vote next week on release of docsSupreme Court to hear arguments on Trump bid to fire Fed Gov. Lisa Cook on Jan. 21The DOJ had refused to make the investigative materials public, despite prior promises by Attorney General Pam Bondi and other Trump administration officials to do so.However, a petition in the House garnered enough support, including from Trump allies such as Representative Nancy Mace and Lauren Boebert, to force a vote on the measure.Former Trump ally and Republican representative Marjorie Taylor Greene has also signed the petition and criticized Trump's reluctance to release more Epstein case materials, leading to a major rift with the president over the weekend.In his latest message on Truth Social, Trump argued that some \"members\" of the Republican Party were being \"used,\" and that the party needed to \"get BACK ON POINT.\"In a separate post late Sunday, Trump singled out Greene, referring to her as a \"Traitor.\" On Saturday, Greene had accused the president of attacking her as part of efforts to \"make an example\" of her and \"scare all the other Republicans\" ahead of the House vote on the Epstein files.Trump has denied having known about Epstein's decades-long abuse of underage girls and young women and has stated the two had a falling out in the early 2000s.However, the House Oversight Committee last week released thousands of emails that showed Epstein and others talking about Trump. However, in the email files, Epstein did not explicitly accuse Trump of any wrongdoing or illegal activity.CNBC's Emily Wilkins and Dan Mangan contributed to this report. Clarification: This story has been updated to clarify that reports indicate the vote is planned for Tuesday, but has not been officially scheduled.",

    "body": "Visitors in front of the Cinderella Castle at Tokyo Disneyland in Tokyo, Japan on Jan. 17, 2023.Bloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesJapan on Monday said it dispatched a senior foreign ministry official to China to ease rising tensions, public broadcaster NHK reported, as tourism-exposed stocks in Tokyo slumped amid the diplomatic feud.Masaaki Kanai, a director-general at Japan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, is expected to meet his counterpart Liu Jinsong on Tuesday, according to media outlet Kyodo.Japan's tourism-exposed stocks fell Monday after Beijing issued a travel and study alert for its citizens considering going to Japan.Beauty and cosmetics firm Shiseido, which relies heavily on Chinese spending, plunged 9.08%. Isetan Mitsukoshi Holdings, the parent company of the Mitsukoshi and Isetan department-store chains, lost more than 11%.Oriental Land, operator of Tokyo Disney Resort, declined 5.68%. Shares of airline operator ANA Holdings fell 3.35%. Hankyu Hanshin Holdings, a rail, retail and hotel operator, was 1.99% lower.China on Thursday accused Japan of intervening in its internal affairs after Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi said earlier this month that the use of military force in any Taiwan conflict could be deemed a \"survival-threatening situation\" for Tokyo. Beijing called the remarks \"egregious\" and demanded a retraction.Takaichi has refused to walk back her comments, although she acknowledged she would adopt a more cautious tone when addressing such matters in parliament.Beijing on Friday issued a travel advisory, saying Takaichi's remarks had raised risks for Chinese nationals in Japan. Chinese airlines responded by offering full refunds or free itinerary changes for flights to Japan.China's foreign ministry said Takaichi's remarks amounted to a provocation. \"These actions by Japan have inevitably raised strong questions and concerns among its Asian neighbors and the international community,\" China's Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Lin Jian said, according to a Google translation of his Mandarin remarks.Japan was the fourth-most popular outbound destination for Chinese travelers in the first 11 months of 2024, accounting for more than 5% of all overseas trips, according to a Citibank report, citing data from the China Tourism Academy. Almost one-fifth of international visitors to Japan in 2024 came from China, or around 7 million people, according to provisional data from the Japan National Tourism Organization.Tokyo on Saturday urged Beijing to keep its response measured, Japan's top government spokesperson, Minoru Kihara, was quoted by Kyodo as saying, adding that China should take \"appropriate measures,\" without offering details.These flare-ups come amid a history of nationalist-driven backlash against Japanese businesses in the mainland. In 2023, Chinese consumers, angered by Japan's release of treated Fukushima nuclear-plant wastewater, mounted a boycott of Japanese cosmetics and household-goods brands.",

    "body": "Tokyo, Japan skyline with the Tokyo TowerChunyip Wong | E+ | Getty ImagesJapan's economy contracted by a smaller-than-expected 1.8% in the third quarter on an annualized basis, with growth in private and government consumption limiting the decline.On a quarter-on-quarter basis, GDP in the three months to September contracted for the first time in six quarters, falling 0.4%, government data released Monday showed.The fall in growth, however, was softer than Reuters poll estimates of a 2.5% annualized contraction and a 0.6% sequential drop.Public demand grew 2.2% annualized, supported mostly by government consumption, while private demand fell 1.8%, dragged lower by a more than 32% drop in residential investments.Exports shrank 4.5% in the third quarter on an annualized basis and 1.2% compared to the second quarter when they had risen by 2.3%.The yen weakened marginally against the dollar, while the Nikkei 225 was down 0.29%. Yields on 10-year Japanese government bonds inched up 3 basis points to 1.73%.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconJapan's exports had seen contractions for four straight months since May as U.S. tariffs hurt shipments, although September saw a rebound to growth. Tokyo in July clinched a trade deal with Washington, bringing down tariffs on its exports to the U.S. to 15% from 25%, effective Aug. 7.Domestic consumption helped slow the economic contraction, with government and private consumption up 0.5% and 0.1%, respectively, compared to the second quarter. Public demand was a bright spot, growing 0.5% quarter on quarter and contributing 0.1 percentage point growth to the Japanese economy.Private demand proved to be the largest drag on GDP this quarter, declining 0.4% compared to the quarter before and pulling the economy down by 0.3 percentage point, as residential investments plunged 9.4%.Harumi Taguchi, principal economist at S&P Global Market Intelligence, said he expects GDP growth to rebound going forward, adding that the impact of new housing rules is expected to diminish. In 2024, Japan mandated stricter energy conservation standards for all new projects starting April 1 this year.Taguchi said that easing uncertainties surrounding U.S. tariffs, as well as the agreement between Washington and Beijing to lower reciprocal duties appear to be influencing orders from Japan positively.The weak quarterly growth is likely to bolster Japan's newly elected Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi's plans to stimulate the economy.Japan's government has reportedly called for \"bold and strategic\" investment in crisis management and growth areas in its upcoming stimulus package by Takaichi's administration.Citing a draft, Reuters reported that \"Japan's government will pledge to increase spending 'without hesitation' to support an economy on the cusp of emerging from stagnation.\" The government will also promote investment in \"key growth areas,\" including artificial intelligence, semiconductors and shipbuilding.Earlier this month, Nikkei reported that the package was over 10 trillion yen ($64.63 billion), including subsidies for electricity and gas bills, as well as help for small and medium companies to help increase wages.",

    "body": "I'd imagine people usually feel anxious about making a drastic life change like picking up and moving to a new country. But I remember sitting in the airport in Los Angeles, Tony Tony Chopper water bottle in hand, feeling excited and eager to start my new life. All I could think about was finding a favorite matcha cafe to spend my mornings in after touching down in Tokyo. Growing up in Southern California, I had always been interested in Japanese culture and cuisine. During the pandemic, I became obsessed with anime: the characters who never gave up, the friendships, the quiet slice-of-life moments. I was infatuated with the sound of the language and the minimalist aesthetic. The shows made me want to experience it all for myself. In January 2025, a little less than a year after I graduated from UC Irvine, I boarded that flight to move to Japan. Escaping financial pressureI've never been someone who followed the \"safe path.\" Even in college, where I studied business administration and management, I avoided internships that would lead to a 9-to-5 corporate career. Deep down, I knew I wanted more freedom than that.But freedom is expensive in America. I was working four jobs after graduation — as a full time visual merchandiser at Lululemon, owner of a small sticker business, real estate sign manager, and organizational manager at a lacrosse club. I felt weighed down by the financial pressure of just existing. It felt impossible to be able to afford rent, health care, and other basics without getting a corporate job.So when I stumbled across an ad in June 2024 about teaching English in Japan with an Eikaiwa, or conversation school, I applied on a whim. I went through an all-day interview process and got the job. I didn't hesitate. Marc Aziz Ressang for CNBC Make ItAlthough they were supportive, everyone around me thought I was crazy for leaving behind a seemingly stable life in California. Why wouldn't I want to be close to family and a long-term boyfriend? But Japan had been calling me for years, and this felt like my chance. Six months of paperwork, packing, and goodbyes later, I was on my way. Living in JapanWhen I arrived in Japan, something about it immediately felt right. Best of all, I could afford to live alone. For 74,460 yen (or $483 a month), I ended up in an apartment in Nakahara-ku, which is part of Kawasaki City and about 15 minutes by train to Tokyo. Marc Aziz Ressang for CNBC Make ItMy apartment has plenty of natural light and even a tatami room (a traditional room with straw mat flooring for tea ceremonies), just like the ones I'd seen in anime. In the U.S., I'd never be able to afford something like this on my own. In Japan, it felt attainable, even comfortable, on my 277,500 yen (about $1,800) a month teaching salary.The cost of living surprised me in other ways, too. A filling meal in Tokyo — like a traditional teishoku (meal set) with a beef rice bowl, miso soup, eggs, and a drink  — could cost just 1,000 yen (about $6), compared to the $20 I was used to paying in California. My company covered my commuting costs and groceries didn't break the bank. For the first time, my basic needs were covered without me constantly worrying. Marc Aziz Ressang for CNBC Make ItTeaching was never my passion, though. It was an \"in\" that allowed me to move to Japan, and for that I'll always be grateful. But after about six months, I realized I wanted something different.Now I make social media content for a language app for $175 a week and work as a freelance digital marketing assistant for $25 an hour. The number of hours for the latter has varied so far from about 50 in August to three in September when we were in between clients to 22 in October, since I traveled to Hawaii and Okinawa that month.Being here has freed up not just money, but mental space. I can focus on pursuing hobbies like creating content about moving abroad, going to the gym, studying Japanese, and connecting with locals, instead of always stressing about how to make ends meet.Dealing with downsidesMoving hasn't been without challenges. Sometimes the language barrier feels frustrating and overwhelming, like when I need to go to the bank or post office, call my phone carrier, or navigate a doctor's appointment. I often rely on AI to translate or ask a friend to help. This, in part, is what motivates me to learn the language better. Marc Aziz Ressang for CNBC Make ItAnd I miss my friends and family back in California. There are days when I feel the sting of loneliness despite being surrounded by millions of people. I'm an extrovert, but even for me it can get tiring to go out of my way to overcome the language barrier and make friends. These struggles have made me more independent and patient, though. And when I slide the door shut on my tatami room and step out of my apartment each morning, I feel a mix of belonging and gratitude. This is my chance to live the life I dreamed about while watching anime as a teenager. I don't know how long I'll stay in Japan. But for now, I'm cherishing every moment. I feel like I'm exactly where I'm supposed to be.Ashley Peters is a digital creator and marketing assistant based in Japan, sharing stories about life abroad, language learning, and creative growth.

    "body": "Adriana Kugler testifies before a Senate Banking Committee hearing on her nomination to be a member of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, on Capitol Hill in Washington, U.S., June 21, 2023. Jonathan Ernst | ReutersFormer Federal Reserve Board Gov. Adriana Kugler last year broke the central bank's rules barring trading of individual stocks and executing financial transactions close to meetings where interest rates are set, actions that led up to her abrupt resignation, according to a report by the U.S. Office of Government Ethics released Saturday.The report comes three months after Kugler mysteriously left from the Fed's Board of Governors without giving a reason. Kugler joined the Fed in September 2023 after being appointed by then-President Joe Biden.Kugler's resignation came after she requested and was denied a waiver by Chair Jerome Powell on a disclosure form that showed she had impermissible holdings, Fed officials familiar with the matter told CNBC.com.An official said that concerns related to trading activity by Kugler or her husband date to at least September 2024, when she began working with ethics officials to resolve violations of trading policies.A financial disclosure report that Kugler filed with the OGE this year on Sept. 11 — which contains details of securities transactions by either her or her husband — notes that an Ethics Office official declined to certify the report.In a note on Friday's disclosure, an Ethics official says, \"Matters related to this disclosure were referred earlier this year\" by the office to the independent Office of Inspector General for the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. An inspector general is an internal ethics watchdog for federal departments and agencies.Another note on the report says, \"Consistent with her September 15, 2024, disclosure, certain trading activity was carried out by Dr. Kugler's spouse, without Dr. Kugler's knowledge and she affirms that her spouse did not intend to violate any rules or policies.\"Troubles with tradesKugler is married to Ignacio Donoso, who is an immigration lawyer.Her disclosure shows two kinds of violations of Fed rules regarding financial transactions by senior officials at the central bank: purchases of stock shares of individual companies, as opposed to mutual funds; and purchases of securities during so-called \"blackout periods\" leading up to and after meetings of the Federal Open Market Committee.The FOMC meetings set key interest rates. Speculation about those meetings and their actual outcome can significantly affect the prices of stocks and bonds.Kugler's violations were related to purchases of stock in companies including Apple, Southwest Airlines, Caterpillar and Cava Group, the report indicates.Kugler participated in FOMC meetings during her tenure at the Fed. But she missed the FOMC's meeting this past July due to what the Fed had publicly said was a personal matter.Shortly before the July meeting, Kugler requested a waiver of the Ethics disclosure filing deadline to address the issue of impermissible holdings within her investment portfolio, according to Fed officials who spoke with CNBC.Two months earlier, she had asked for and received a standard extension for filing annual ethics disclosures, officials said.Powell, given the repeated efforts to deal with Kugler's issues, denied her request for another waiver, which led to her not participating in the FOMC meeting in July.Shortly afterward, on Aug. 1, Kugler announced her intention to resign on Aug. 8In another disclosure filed in October 2024, Kugler likewise pointed a finger at her husband Donoso for four stock purchases — three of Apple shares in July that year, and one of Cava shares that September — which violated Fed trading rules.\"These four purchases were carried out by my spouse, without my knowledge, and I affirm that my spouse did not intend to violate any rules,\" Kugler said at the time.\"Upon learning about the purchases, I immediately notified ethics officials, and at their direction, I initiated divestiture of these assets as soon as possible under FOMC ethics policies.\"CNBC has reached out to Kugler for comment on the new Ethics disclosure report, which also discloses that Kugler received more than $41,000 worth of \"pro bono legal services\" from the law firm Arnold & Porter.Pro bono means for free.CNBC has also requested comment from Donoso.Rule changesAfter she resigned from the Fed, Kugler returned to Georgetown University in Washington, D.C., where she is a professor at the McCourt School of Public Policy and Economics.In early 2022, the Fed adopted new rules that banned officials from trading in individual stocks and bonds, as well as cryptocurrencies.That move came after revelations that then-regional Fed presidents Eric Rosengren of Boston and Robert Kaplan of Dallas traded stocks and stock funds shortly before the central bank adopted broad measures to support the U.S. economy during the first weeks of the Covid-19 pandemic.Rosengren and Kaplan were cleared of any legal wrongdoing, but both of them left their positions amid questions about the propriety of Fed officials possibly using privileged information for financial gain. Other trades from Fed officials, including Powell, also faced scrutiny and drew intense criticism from the public and on Capitol Hill.Kugler's surprise resignation allowed President Donald Trump to appoint Stephen Miran to replace her for the remainder of her term on the Fed Board of Governors.Miran, whose current term ends on Jan. 31, took an unpaid leave of absence as chair of the White House Council of Economic Advisors.In 2024, the Fed's inspector general found that Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic, who is retiring in February, violated trading rules.",

    "body": "A street sign is seen near the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York City, New York, U.S., August 7, 2025.  Eduardo Munoz | ReutersNew York Federal Reserve President John Williams met with Wall Street's dealers last week about a key lending facility, the Financial Times reported, citing three individuals familiar with the matter.The meeting, which took place on the sidelines on Wednesday at the Fed's annual Treasury market conference, included representatives from many of the 25 primary dealers of banks that underwrite the government's debt, according to the report. The meeting participants were members of banks' teams that specialize in fixed income markets, the report said.CNBC has confirmed the meeting took place.Williams sought feedback from these dealers on the use of the Fed's standing repo facility — a permanent lending tool that allows eligible financial institutions to borrow cash from the central bank in return for high-quality collateral such as Treasury bonds. The tool would allow institutions to sell securities to the Fed with an agreement to repurchase them at a later time, essentially acting as a backstop for markets.\"President Williams convened the New York Fed's primary trading counterparties [primary dealers] to continue engagement on the purpose of the standing repo facility as a tool of monetary policy implementation and to solicit feedback that ensures it remains effective for rate control,\" a spokesperson for the New York Fed told the Financial Times, which reported the news on Friday.The meeting took place amid brewing concerns about stress in parts of the U.S. financial system and signs of tighter market liquidity.Roberto Perli, who manages the Fed's System Open Market Account, which is the central bank's bonds and cash holdings, said Wednesday that firms in need of the central bank's standing repo facility should \"be used whenever it is economically sensible to do so.\"The New York Fed did not immediately respond to a CNBC request for comment.Read the complete Financial Times report here.",

    "body": "The exterior of the main entrance of Ford Motor's new world headquarters in Dearborn, Michigan.FordDEARBORN, Mich. — Ford Motor is swapping its 1950s \"Glass House\" headquarters for a new, modern industrial facility to promote collaboration and better appease thousands of employees who have returned to offices in recent years after remote working.The new 2.1-million-square-foot facility in Dearborn, Michigan, is ceremoniously opening Sunday, although construction is expected to continue into 2027.It replaces a 12-story, rectangular-shaped headquarters roughly three miles away in the city that is expected to be demolished. The new building marks Ford's sixth headquarters since its founding in 1903.Currently nicknamed \"The Hub,\" the new headquarters will consolidate thousands of employees and several prior locations under one — albeit very large — roof. It is eventually expected to be home to up to 4,000 executives and employees involved with daily business operations, design and product development.Ford Motor's new world headquarters in Dearborn, Michigan, will function as corporate offices as well as a design and product development center.FordFrom an operational basis, the new headquarters is roughly split evenly between office functions and design and industrial operations. Design includes massive studios with hidden courtyards and a large showroom. The other half is set to be used for general business operations such as executive offices and common work and meeting areas.There are very few actual offices outside of those for top executives, according to the company. The idea is for employees to be able to work as they choose in different areas, or \"neighborhoods,\" depending on what they're working on that day, officials said. Domain staking, where employees attempt to make a space their permanent workplace, will be discouraged, said Jennifer Kolstad, global design and brand director for Ford Land, the automaker's property management group.\"It's not just a building. This is a space that is a tool for our employees to be more productive, to be more collaborative, and really help deliver the Ford+ plan,\" said Jim Dobleske, Ford Land chair and CEO, during a tour of the building.The Ford+ plan was introduced by CEO Jim Farley as a turnaround and efficiency plan for the automaker in 2021.A coffee bar in Ford Motor's new world headquarters in Dearborn, Michigan.FordAs of the end of last year, Ford employed roughly 30,500 white-collar salaried workers in the U.S. The company continues to own or utilize other properties throughout the U.S., including large bases in Dearborn and surrounding areas.Many salaried employees are expected in offices at least four days a week, as of earlier this year, after many of them had a more loose hybrid office-home schedule following the end of the pandemic.\"We're inviting them back into a space that is a tool to help them do their best work. And that best work tends to come with collaboration with other teams,\" Dobleske said.Scratch kitchensSome of that collaboration is expected to occur over food.The new headquarters includes a 160,000-square-foot dining area with eight \"kitchen concepts\" that will feature rotating menus as well as take-home options such as pizza and $6 whole rotisserie chickens, decadent desserts and a juice bar complete with a herb garden.A worker takes out a batch of rotisserie chickens inside Ford Motor's new world headquarters on Nov. 10, 2025, in Dearborn, Michigan.Michael Wayland / CNBC\"We have guests coming in from all over the world, so we wanted to make sure we have designed our menus to kind of play homage to that diversity,\" said Grant Vella, executive chef for the new ]headquarters. \"We wanted to do something different, push the boundary of business dining.\"Outside of the kitchens and dining areas, vegetation and outdoor spaces are meant to make for a more walkable-friendly campus compared with the automaker's prior, largely street- and parking lot-locked facility.\"This headquarters is the cornerstone of our campus redevelopment, but there's been a tremendous amount of work that we have done throughout the campus to really connect it and make it much more walkable for our employees,\" Dobleske said, pointing to several facilities and areas, including a test track and 18-acre \"Horsepower Park,\" surrounding the building.An herb garden inside the dining and kitchen area of Ford Motor's new world headquarters on Nov. 10, 2025 in Dearborn, Michigan.Michael Wayland / CNBCInside the building are six courtyards, including a dual-level one at the center of the company's new design studios to allow designers to take products outside to view them outdoors in natural light.

There's also a coffee bar on a large landing above the main lobby.Ford Bronco parts painted white in the American Road Lobby of the automaker's new world headquarters in Dearborn, Michigan.FordThe coffee bar overlooks a white artwork that features vehicle parts — one of many prominent pieces of art Ford purchased or has curated for the new facility. Others are photos or drawings of vehicles, while some are simply non-automotive artistic pieces.Inside the company's design operations are large studios with advanced clay milling machines, a spacious showroom that will operate as a modern design dome and a 64-foot screen showing virtual reviews and testing.What employees will not see much of is the company's logo, the well-known blue oval surrounding the \"Ford\" name. There will be a massive Ford blue oval logo on the outside of the building but not on its interior. Unless you look closely.On some exterior glass walls, such as the company's design operations, there's a glass pattern that features the ovals accompanied by hidden numbers that represent Ford patents.Ford's signature blue oval design can be seen in glass on the outside of its new world headquarters, in addition to numbers representing patents held by the company.FordFord declined to discuss the capital spent to build its new headquarters and design center, which was part of a previously announced $1 billion campus transformation that began under former CEO Jim Hackett, who previously led furniture company Steelcase.Here's a look inside the new world headquarters:Workers prepare to raise a large Ford Motor blue oval onto the company's new headquarters on Nov. 10, 2025 in Dearborn, Michigan.

These experts assign their ratings after in-depth analysis of a company's financials and growth potential.Here are three dividend-paying stocks, highlighted by Wall Street's top pros, as tracked by TipRanks, a platform that ranks analysts based on their past performance.Diamondback EnergyFirst on this week's list is Diamondback Energy (FANG), an independent energy company focused on onshore oil and natural gas reserves in the Permian Basin in West Texas. The company recently reported better-than-expected third-quarter results. Diamondback returned $892 million of capital to shareholders (50% of adjusted free cash flow) via share repurchases and dividends in the third quarter. It declared a base cash dividend of $1.00 per share for the period, payable on Nov. 20. At an annualized dividend of $4 per share, FANG offers a yield of 2.8%.In reaction to the third-quarter print, RBC Capital analyst Scott Hanold reiterated a buy rating on Diamondback stock with a price forecast of $173. Interestingly, TipRanks' AI Analyst is also bullish on FANG stock with an \"outperform\" rating and a price target of $156.Hanold continues to view Diamondback as a core long-term holding in the energy space, given that it stands out with one of the top core inventory durations in the Permian Basin and the lowest breakeven levels of $37 to $38 per barrel (WTI, unhedged, and inclusive of capitalized costs).\"FANG remains among the most resilient E&P, with leading edge operational, capital, and production performance,\" said Hanold.The 5-star analyst expects Diamondback to gain from the renewed gas-fired power prospects in the Permian Basin, supported by its strong footprint and natural gas exposure. Hanold noted that FANG is a part of the Competitive Power Ventures project, where the company has agreed to supply 50 million cubic feet per day to a 1,350-megawatt combined cycle gas turbine. He added that management is optimistic about securing more power/data center deals.Hanold ranks No. 69 among more than 10,000 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been profitable 64% of the time, delivering an average return of 26.2%. Permian ResourcesHanold is also bullish on another dividend-paying energy company, Permian Resources (PR). The independent oil and gas company delivered upbeat earnings for the third quarter, citing its dominance in the Delaware Basin. Permian declared a base dividend of 15 cents per share for the fourth quarter, payable on Dec. 31. At an annualized dividend of 60 cents per share, PR stock offers a yield of 4.5%.Impressed by the results, Hanold reaffirmed a buy rating on Permian Resources stock with a price target of $18. TipRanks' AI Analyst has an \"outperform\" rating on PR stock with a price target of $14.50.The top-rated analyst stated that continued \"proficient operational and financial performance has become a hallmark\" for Permian, which he believes the company can continue in the years ahead. Hanold highlighted PR's robust operational performance that reflected a solid growth in organic production with no increase in spending.Hanold noted that the implied fourth-quarter oil guidance is up 2% to 3% from the prior consensus forecast. Accordingly, he now expects 188 Mb/d (oil) for the fourth quarter, which is 3% above his previous estimate. The analyst added that management seems confident about keeping capital spending steady at current levels while generating solid free cash flow, with dividend payment supported even at around $40 per barrel.Additionally, Hanold sees the possibility of an increase in Permian's fixed dividend in early 2026. He also expects the company to make opportunistic stock buybacks. The analyst expects Permian to use the remaining free cash flow to further bolster an already solid balance sheet (0.8x leverage ratios). Duke EnergyFinally, let's look at Duke Energy (DUK), an energy holding company that generates and distributes electricity and natural gas. The company recently reported better-than-anticipated adjusted earnings per share for the third quarter, citing the implementation of new rates and riders, along with increased retail sales volumes.Last month, Duke Energy declared a quarterly cash dividend of $1.065 per share, payable on Dec. 16. At an annualized dividend of $4.26 per share, DUK stock offers a yield of 3.4%.Noting the third-quarter performance, Evercore analyst Nicholas Amicucci reaffirmed a buy rating on DUK stock with a price target of $143. In comparison, TipRanks' AI Analyst has a \"neutral\" rating on Duke Energy stock with a price target of $135.Amicucci noted Duke Energy's strong third-quarter results and an early look into its updated capital plan expected to be announced in February 2026. Notably, the company mentioned a $95 billion to $105 billion plan for 2026 to 2030, with an equity funding target of 30% to 50%.Furthermore, the 5-star analyst highlighted that management sees continued momentum into the next year, expecting to turn large load economic opportunities into tangible projects with signed energy service agreements. Amicucci added that Duke Energy is well-positioned to add at least 8.5 gigawatt of new dispatchable generation across its service areas, including about 1 GW of uprates and 7.5 GW of new natural gas assets.Overall, Amicucci remains bullish on Duke's future growth, driven by its premium service areas, solid pipeline of new projects, and the fact that about 90% of its electric capital spending qualifies for efficient-recovery mechanisms, \"alleviating seemingly all regulatory lag.\"Amicucci ranks No. 693 among more than 10,000 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been successful 79% of the time, delivering an average return of 48.1 %. ",

    "body": "U.S. President Donald Trump gestures during an announcement from the State Dining Room at the White House in Washington, D.C., U.S., Oct. 23, 2025.Jonathan Ernst | ReutersPresident Donald Trump on Friday exempted key agricultural imports like coffee, cocoa, bananas and certain beef products from his higher tariff rates.The move comes as Trump faces political blowback for high prices at U.S. grocery stores. Some distributors of beef, coffee, chocolate and other common food items have raised prices as Trump's tariffs took hold this year, adding to pressure on household budgets created by decades-high inflation in recent years.Trump's action Friday also exempts a range of fruits including tomatoes, avocados, coconuts, oranges and pineapples. Along with coffee, the tariff reductions extend to black and green tea, and spices like cinnamon and nutmeg.The move marks a reversal for Trump, who has insisted tariffs are necessary to protect U.S. businesses and workers. He has contended U.S. consumers will not ultimately pay for the higher duties.The exemptions come just a day after Trump reached trade framework agreements with four Latin American countries – including 10% tariffs on most goods from Argentina, Guatemala, and El Salvador, and 15% from Ecuador. It also removes duties specifically on products not grown or produced in the U.S. in sufficient quantities, like bananas and coffee.Rising food prices have hampered U.S. households for several years. Consumer Price Index data show food-at-home prices increased approximately 2.7% year-over-year in September. (More recent data was delayed because of the government shutdown).The tariff exemptions aim to help moderate these grocery price increases, although experts caution that other factors such as global supply shortages also influence prices, especially for coffee and beef.Here's more background on how industries like beef, coffee and cocoa have reacted to tariffs and rising prices.BeefA customer shops for meat at a Costco store on Nov. 11, 2025 in Novato, California. Justin Sullivan | Getty ImagesThe tariff exemption for beef comes after months of rising prices tied in part to Trump's own tariff policy.Over the past year, the U.S. imposed steep duties on major suppliers including Brazil, Australia, New Zealand and Uruguay. Brazil – the world's second-largest beef producer – has faced effective tariff rates topping 75%, driving down imports into the U.S. just as the cattle herd in the country hit a near 75-year low.Ranchers have struggled to rebuild herds amid drought, higher feed costs and tariffs on fertilizer, steel and aluminum that have made equipment and repairs more expensive.The supply squeeze has fueled a spike in prices at the grocery store: uncooked beef products rose 12% to 18% year over year in September, according to the most recent consumer price index report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.Producers told CNBC earlier this month that policy whiplash, from changing tariff rates to the recent expansion of Argentina's beef quota, has further chilled long-term investment, keeping supplies tight and sentiment fragile.CoffeeCoffee beans are displayed at a grocery store on Nov. 13, 2025 in San Anselmo, California.Justin Sullivan | Getty ImagesGround roast coffee prices in the U.S. reached $8.41 per pound in July, a record high and a 33% increase from the prior year, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data.Trump's 50% tariff on Brazilian coffee –  which supplies roughly a third of U.S. imports – drove up costs across the roasting and retail supply chains. Vietnam, Colombia and other major exporters have also been swept up in the administration's food tariffs.Roasters and cafés say they have no way around the duties because the U.S. produces none of the beans it consumes, leaving importers exposed to higher costs regardless of origin. The September CPI report found that coffee prices climbed nearly 21% in August from the prior year. That was the largest jump since the 1990s.Retailers have warned the impact could have spread if tariffs stayed in place. The Tax Foundation estimated in August that 74% of U.S. food imports faced tariffs, already hitting tea, spices and other products that, like coffee, have no domestic supply chain.Many of those products that have little or no U.S. production were on the list of items Trump exempted from higher tariffs Friday.Global coffee prices are hovering near a 50-year high reached in February.CocoaCocoa has faced similar price pressures.Even after a sharp selloff this fall, futures are still more than double pre-pandemic levels, costing roughly $5,300 today, following tariffs and three years of weather-driven crop failures in the Ivory Coast and Ghana.In October, Hershey executives said they expected $160 million to $170 million in tariff expenses this year, on top of record-high bean costs that pushed retail chocolate prices nearly 30% higher from the prior year heading into Halloween, according to research firm Circana.",

The memo alleged \"Alibaba provides tech support for Chinese military 'operations' against targets in the U.S.,\" according to the FT. The FT said it could not independently verify the claims, and did not publish a full version of the memo. It was not clear when the memo was released. The White House did not respond to requests for comment, while the FT said it stood by its reporting.\"The assertions and innuendoes in the article are completely false,\" Alibaba said in a statement to CNBC on the FT report. \"We question the motivation behind the anonymous leak, which the FT admits that they cannot verify,\" Alibaba said. \"This malicious PR operation clearly came from a rogue voice looking to undermine President Trump's recent trade deal with China.\"watch nowU.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping met in South Korea last month for the first time since Trump began his second term in January. The leaders agreed to a rollback of tariffs and export controls for 12 months, easing bilateral tensions that have escalated this year.The lack of details in the FT report \"does raise the question of whether some of the China hawks in the administration are trying to undercut the President's deal with Xi Jinping,\" Andy Rothman, founder of consulting firm Sinology, said Monday on CNBC's \"Squawk Box Asia.\"He pointed out that Trump had not said anything about the FT report, while noting that all the major U.S. cloud computing companies have contracts with the U.S. government.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tWeekly analysis and insights from Asia's largest economy in your inbox\n\t\t\tSubscribe now\n\t\t\n\tThe U.S. has ramped up efforts over the last few years to restrict China's access to advanced semiconductors for training artificial intelligence models.\"The fact that Alibaba's stock price dropped so rapidly in response [to the FT report] shows how much China's AI industry is on edge over possible new sanctions,\" said Kyle Chan, a Brookings fellow who focuses on China tech.Alibaba shares had closed 3.78% lower in the U.S. on Friday following the report, but were up more than 1% in Hong Kong on Monday.  Chan pointed out the FT report comes as Alibaba's open-source Qwen AI model is growing in popularity in Silicon Valley, increasing the threat to the pay-to-use models from U.S. AI companies OpenAI and Anthropic — while investors are increasingly worried about a possible AI bubble.Alibaba is set to release quarterly results on Nov. 25 ahead of the U.S. market open.—CNBC's Eamon Javers and Elaine Yu contributed to this report.",

    "body": "Nikolas Kokovlis | Nurphoto | Getty ImagesAlphabet and Disney on Friday announced that they've reached a deal to restore content from ABC and ESPN onto Google's YouTube TV.The deal comes after a two-week standoff between the two companies that started on Oct. 31. The stalemate resulted in numerous live sporting events, including college football games and two Monday Night Football games, being absent from the popular streaming service.\"We're happy to share that we've reached an agreement with Disney that preserves the value of our service for our subscribers and future flexibility in our offers,\" YouTube said in a statement. \"Subscribers should see channels including ABC, ESPN and FX returning to their service over the course of the day, as well as any recordings that were previously in their Library. We apologize for the disruption and appreciate our subscribers' patience as we negotiated on their behalf.\"Disney Entertainment's co-chairs Alan Bergman and Dana Walden, along with ESPN Chairman Jimmy Pitaro, said in a statement that said the agreement reflects \"how audiences choose to watch\" entertainment.\"We are pleased that our networks have been restored in time for fans to enjoy the many great programming options this weekend, including college football,\" they said.More than 20 Disney-owned channels were removed from YouTube TV, which offered its subscribers $20 credits this week due to the dispute. In addition to ABC and ESPN, other networks that were unavailable included FX, NatGeo, Disney Channel and Freeform. The main sticking point between the two companies was the rate Disney charges YouTube TV for its networks. Disney's most valuable channel, ESPN, charges carriage of more than $10 a month per pay-TV subscriber, a higher fee than any other network in the U.S., CNBC previously reported.It's not the first conflict this year between YouTube and legacy media.NBCUniversal content was nearly removed from YouTube TV before the companies reached an agreement in October, preventing shows like \"Sunday Night Football\" and \"America's Got Talent\" from being pulled.YouTube TV also found itself in a standoff with Fox in August that almost resulted in Fox News, Fox Sports and other Fox channels going dark on the service just before the start of the college football season. The two sides were able to strike a deal to prevent a blackout.YouTube said it has the option for future program packages with Disney and other partners.Disney said that access to a selection of live and on-demand programming from ESPN Unlimited, which includes content from ESPN+ and new content on its all-inclusive digital service coming later this year, will be available on YouTube TV to base plan subscribers at no additional cost by the end of 2026.Here's the memo that Disney executives sent to employees:Team,We're pleased to share that we've reached a new agreement with YouTube TV, and all of our stations and networks are in the process of being restored to the service.While this was a challenging moment, it ultimately led to a strong outcome for both consumers and for our company, with a deal that recognizes the tremendous value of the high-quality entertainment, sports, and news that fans have come to expect from Disney.Over the past few years, we've led the way in creating innovative deals with key partners –each one unique, and each designed to recognize the full value of our programming. This new agreement reflects that same creativity and commitment to doing what's best for both our audiences and our business.We're proud of the work that went into this deal and grateful to everyone who helped make it happen — especially Sean Breen, Jimmy Zasowski, and the Platform Distribution team for their tireless commitment throughout this process.Thank you all for your patience and professionalism over the past several weeks. As you all know, the media landscape continues to evolve quickly, which makes these types of negotiations complex. What hasn't changed is our focus on the viewer. Our priority is — and will always be — delivering the best experiences and the best value to fans, and we'll continue working closely with our partners to ensure we're fulfilling that mission for our audiences.We're incredibly optimistic about what's ahead and grateful to all of you for continuing to set the standard for entertainment around the world.Alan, Dana & JimmyDisclosure: Comcast is the parent company of NBCUniversal, which owns CNBC.

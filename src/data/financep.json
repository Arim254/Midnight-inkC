It has attracted commitments from a growing list of wealthy individuals, from billionaires such as Michael and Susan Dell and Ray Dalio to rap artist Nicki Minaj. \"JPMorgan Chase has demonstrated a long-term commitment to the financial health and well-being of all of our employees and their families around the world, including more than 190,000 here in the United States,\" CEO Jamie Dimon said in a release. \"By matching this contribution, we're making it easier for them to start saving early, invest wisely, and plan for their family's financial future.\"In a memo sent to employees Wednesday first reported by Reuters, Bank of America said it applauded the government's \"innovative solutions\" for employee savings. Financial firms dominate the list of companies that are matching contributions for the new accounts. Besides JPMorgan and Bank of America, the two largest U.S. banks by assets, BlackRock, BNY, Robinhood, SoFi and Charles Schwab have made similar announcements.watch now",

    "body": "U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell holds a press conference after the Fed cut interest rates by quarter of a percentage point, in Washington, D.C., U.S., October 29, 2025. Kevin Lamarque | ReutersThis week's Federal Reserve meeting offers little suspense and probably not much action, even as massive changes loom over the central bank's longer-term direction.Judging by market expectations and policymakers' comments, there's virtually no chance the Fed will change its benchmark interest rate when the meeting ends Wednesday.Despite a recent spate of disagreements among Federal Open Market Committee members about the longer-term trajectory of monetary policy, the near-term stance likely will be one of patience as a series of cuts made last year work their way through the economy.\"Overall, the Fed just wants to stand pat. They feel they've got time to wait and see,\" former Fed Vice Chair Roger Ferguson said in a CNBC interview Monday. \"This feels like a wait-and-see meeting, and we should all be listening to see if there's any hint or a bias towards a future action.\"watch nowIndications of where the FOMC heads from here would come from the post-meeting policy statement as well as Chair Jerome Powell's news conference afterward. Markets currently expect the Fed to cut once or twice this year — most likely in June and December, according to futures market pricing gauged by the CME Group's FedWatch tool.However, the focus most certainly will lie beyond the interest rate decision and future guidance and into an unprecedented web of intrigue that surrounds the meeting.Storm around PowellFor one, President Donald Trump told CNBC last week that he may have narrowed down his search for Powell's successor to a single candidate, a nomination that could be announced this week and perhaps even timed to coincide with the Fed rate decision.\"If there is a single most likely window, it's during the January FOMC — particularly if Trump is lookingto redirect attention away from a Fed that didn't cut,\" Stephanie Roth, chief economist at Wolfe Research, said in a note. \"More broadly, the decision could come as soon as this week, or within the next couple of weeks.\"Also operating in the background: The Justice Department has served Powell with a subpoena seeking information on the Fed's massive renovation project on its Washington, D.C., headquarters. In an unusually candid videotaped statement, Powell called the probe a \"pretext\" for Trump's desire to bully the Fed into cutting rates even more aggressively than it has in recent months.There's uncertainty elsewhere, too, with Trump's effort to unseat Fed Governor Lisa Cook over mortgage fraud allegations in front of the U.S. Supreme Court last week, and Trump appointee Stephen Miran's term expiring Saturday. Fed governors can serve until they are replaced, so it's not clear how much longer Miran will stay on the board. He dissented from each of last year's three, quarter percentage point rate cuts, favoring even larger moves.So while the market will pay close attention to interest rate developments and indications, much of the scrutiny will go toward the ancillary events that have rocked the central bank.Political pressures\"While the Fed has been politically pressured to cut rates, it is not pressed by the data,\" wrote Gregory Daco, chief economist at EY-Parthenon. However, Powell \"is likely to refrain from commenting directly on the Department of Justice probe involving himself and the Fed, as well as the Supreme Court's pending ruling related to Governor Cook.\"That won't stop media members from asking, though.\"Powell will be asked about his video warning that Trump DoJ subpoenas and other actions seekto subject monetary policy to the 'preferences of the president,'\" Krishna Guha, head of global policy and central bank strategy at Evercore ISI, said in a note. \"We think he will stand by everything he said and express faith in the Supreme Court as the final arbiter of Fed independence.\"Absent further political developments, that will bring the focus back to policy.Markets will look to decipher whether the hold this month is hawkish, the precursor of an extended period of no cuts, or dovish, in which Powell and the committee indicate that more cuts are likely, just not now.Morgan Stanley's chief economist, Michael Gapen, expects to see a tilt toward dovish.\"We think recent stabilization in the labor market and solid activity data will be the main drivers behind the decision to pause rate cuts, while incoming data on inflation will keep the Fed confident enough about disinflation later this year to retain an easing bias,\" Gapen said in a note. \"We do not believe committee members are ready to signal an end to the cutting cycle.\"Gapen is also looking for several changes in the post-meeting statement, likely reflecting an upgrade to economic growth and a removal of language on increased downside risks to employment.

    "body": "watch nowNew York City Mayor Zohran Mamdani on Wednesday said the city's wealthiest must pay more in taxes to help fill the staggering budget deficit of more than $12 billion that he was left by his predecessor.\"This is at a scale that's actually greater than what we saw here in New York City during the Great Recession,\" Mamdani said of that budget hole during an interview with CNBC \"Squawk Box\" co-anchor Andrew Ross Sorkin at City Hall.The Democrat, who took office on Jan. 1 after campaigning on a platform of hiking taxes on the rich, attributed the big deficit to \"gross fiscal mismanagement.\" He pointed to actions taken by former Mayor Eric Adams, and by ex-New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, whom he soundly defeated in the November general election, for causing that budget gap.Mamdani vowed that his administration will be up front with New Yorkers about budget issues that have been \"hidden from them for far too long.\"City Comptroller Mark Levine earlier this month said the new mayor faces a budget shortfall that is projected to total $12.6 billion over the next two fiscal years. That comprises a $2.2 billion projected deficit on the city's nearly $116 billion budget for fiscal 2026, which ends on June 30, and a $10.4 billion gap in fiscal 2027.Mamdani on Wednesday said that his plan to address the deficit will also include finding savings in the budget.He gave the example of the Adams administration launching a \"basically unusable\" artificial intelligence chatbot that reportedly cost about $600,000 to develop.\"I think the scale of this crisis is one where we have to pursue all of these things,\" Mamdani said.\"I have to show that the city government is not just serious about public goods, but also public excellence and public efficiency, and so we have to make sure every dollar that's being spent is actually being spent in a worthwhile way,\" he said.watch nowThe 34-year-old former state assemblyman, while campaigning for mayor last year, vowed to raise the city's corporate tax rate to 11.5%, matching New Jersey's rate.He also promised to impose a flat 2% tax on New Yorkers who earn more than $1 million per year.Mamdani's sudden rise to prominence after his stunning upset victory over Cuomo in the 2025 Democratic mayoral primary, and his self-identification as a democratic socialist, has caused consternation among some of the city's business elite.  A number of those leaders warned that his redistributionist agenda could hobble the city, which is the nation's financial capital.Read more CNBC politics coverageTrump says he wants 'very honorable and honest investigation' of Alex Pretti killingDemocrats to Trump: Fire Kristi Noem or risk her impeachmentThe government is barreling toward a partial shutdown over DHS funding.

He noted that the number of millionaires in New York has increased since the state raised taxes on the wealthy in 2021. And Mamadni stressed that his revenue plans are aimed at increasing the quality of city services.\"We're sitting here right now in one of the coldest stretches in New York City weather history,\" the mayor noted.\"One of the reasons why the city could start to get back on its feet was because we had a Sanitation Department that was staffed by thousands of people,\" he said. \"That's only possible when you're actually investing in public service.\"watch now",

By exiting these remaining unprofitable doors, we are taking actions to reduce costs and support the long-term health of the business.\"Allbirds said it will continue to operate two outlet stores in the U.S. and two full-price stores in London.The sustainable shoe company got its start in Silicon Valley and flourished during the direct-to-consumer boom, making its initial public offering in 2021. It joined a number of DTC companies that sought to build their customer bases through physical retail and banked on opening stores to boost balance sheets.Now, as rents rise, physical retail loses its shine and being digitally native becomes more important, Allbirds and other DTC companies have begun to shift their focus. The sneaker company has previously announced gradual store closures across the country.In its third-quarter earnings report, in November, the company said its net revenue took a 23.3% hit from the same period a year ago, primarily due to impacts from international distributor changes and physical store closures. Compared with last year, net revenue from stores in the U.S. decreased by roughly 20%. Allbirds has a $32 million market cap but has seen its stock plunge more than 80% over the past two years. ",

Thousands of people died after the Islamic Republic cracked down on the unrest. But the U.S. president has held back from military intervention so far.Trump said the fleet deployed to the Middle East is larger than the forces he ordered to the Caribbean before the U.S. captured former Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro. \"Like with Venezuela, it is, ready, willing, and able to rapidly fulfill its mission, with speed and violence, if necessary,\" Trump said of the carrier strike group Tuesday in the social media post. He called for Tehran to make a deal on its nuclear program. \"Time is running out, it is truly of the essence! As I told Iran once before, MAKE A DEAL!,\" Trump said. The president warned Iran that a possible attack would be worse than the bombing campaign he ordered last June on the Islamic Republic's nuclear facilities. \"The next attack will be far worse! Don't make that happen again,\" he said.",

It is a larger fleet, headed by the great Aircraft Carrier Abraham Lincoln, than that sent to Venezuela,\" Trump posted on Truth Social. \"Like with Venezuela, it is, ready, willing, and able to rapidly fulfill its mission, with speed and violence, if necessary,\" he added.Trump said he hoped Iran would come to the table to negotiate \"a fair and equitable deal\" regarding its nuclear weapons program.\"Time is running out, it is truly of the essence,\" Trump said.\"As I told Iran once before, MAKE A DEAL! They didn't, and there was \"Operation Midnight Hammer,\" a major destruction of Iran. The next attack will be far worse! Don't make that happen again,\" the president added.'Operation Midnight Hammer' refers to a U.S.-led operation in June 2025 to destroy several key Iranian nuclear facilities that the U.S. said were being used to enrich uranium for use in nuclear weapons.It's not the first warning to Tehran that U.S. military assets were being moved toward the Middle East. Last week, Trump said an \"armada\" was heading toward Iran but that he hoped he didn't have to use it. That warning came after authorities' brutal clampdown on nationwide protests in Iran.Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi said Wednesday that he had not been in contact with U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff in recent days or requested negotiations, Reuters reported, citing Iranian state media.The U.S. has used a variety of sanctions targeting Iran's illicit oil trade, as well as military threats and action, to try to bring Tehran to the negotiating table to halt its nuclear program. Trump pulled the U.S. out of an Obama-era nuclear deal in 2018, during his first term in office, saying the deal was \"decaying and rotten.\"Trump said in March 2025 that he wanted to renegotiate a nuclear deal with Iran after reimposing a \"maximum pressure\" campaign on the Islamic Republic but efforts to renew talks appear to have failed.Iran was back on the president's radar last month, however, after public unrest erupted over ongoing economic hardship in the country and its religious-conservative leadership.Iran's security services' crackdown on the protests, mass arrests and threatened executions prompted Trump to warn Iran that he would use military action against the country if it \"violently kills\" protestors. He then suggested the threat had worked, leading to a temporary de-escalation of tensions with the White House. Some reports suggest that the death toll during the unrest could top 30,000 people, but Iranian-focused human rights group HRANA says 6,221 people are confirmed to have died, while over 17,000 deaths are still under investigation. The total number of arrests has reached 42,324, HRANA reported Tuesday.",

Appearing together at a forum in the French capital as they seek to shore up support from European allies, the political leaders sought to portray a united front amid U.S. President Donald Trump's Greenland threats. \"The world order as we know it that we have been fighting for 80 years is over and I don't think it will return,\" Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said at Science Po University in Paris, according to Reuters.\"The best way forward for the U.S, Europe is to stick together … We will try to find a way forward with U.S. We share concerns on Arctic security. Russia does not want peace with Europe,\" she added. Greenland's Nielsen, meanwhile, said the self-governing Danish territory agrees that there is a need for more surveillance and security in the Arctic \"because of the way Russia acts now.\" He added that Greenland would not give in to foreign pressure.\"What we are dealing with as a government is trying to push back from outside and handle our people who are afraid and scared,\" Nielsen said.The comments come shortly after Nielsen and Frederiksen held talks with German Chancellor Friedrich Merz in Berlin on Tuesday. Trump, who has long advocated for control of Greenland, said in a surprise development last week that he had secured a framework of a future deal with respect to Greenland. The U.S. president did not give further details at the time, although he said talks would continue to reach an agreement.Opinion polls have shown that Greenlanders overwhelmingly oppose U.S. control, while a strong majority support independence from Denmark.Nielsen and Frederiksen are both expected to meet with French President Emmanuel Macron at the Élysée Palace in Paris later in the day.",

    "body": "People walk onto an escalator under a Starbucks coffee sign in Manhattan on Dec. 2, 2025 in New York City. Spencer Platt | Getty ImagesStarbucks on Wednesday reported mixed quarterly results as the company's turnaround propels traffic growth for the first time in two years but weighs on its bottom line.\"Our Q1 results demonstrate our 'Back to Starbucks' strategy is working and we believe we're ahead of schedule,\" CEO Brian Niccol said in a statement. \"It's great to see the sales momentum driven by more customers choosing Starbucks more often, and this is just the beginning.\"The company also shared its first financial outlook since suspending its forecast in October 2024. For fiscal 2026, Starbucks is projecting adjusted earnings per share in a range of $2.15 to $2.40, on the lower end of Wall Street's estimates of $2.35 per share, according to LSEG. The company is also expecting global and U.S. same-store sales growth of at least 3%.Shares of Starbucks rose nearly 5% in early trading.Here's what the company reported for the quarter ended Dec. 28 compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:Earnings per share: 56 cents adjusted vs. 59 cents expectedRevenue: $9.92 billion vs. $9.67 billion expectedThe coffee giant reported fiscal first-quarter net income attributable to Starbucks of $293.3 million, or 26 cents per share, down from $780.8 million, or 69 cents per share, a year earlier. In addition to costs related to the turnaround, higher coffee prices and tariffs weighed on the company's margins during the quarter.Excluding restructuring costs, impairment charges and other items, Starbucks earned 56 cents per share.Net sales rose 6% to $9.92 billion, driven by the company's second straight quarter of same-store sales growth.\"We're seeing exactly what we want to see in our top line at this point in our turnaround,\" CFO Cathy Smith said on the company's earnings conference call.Global same-store sales increased 4%, topping StreetAccount estimates of 2.3%. Traffic grew 3%, marking the first time that the company's transactions have grown in two years. Moreover, Starbucks saw transaction growth from both loyalty program members and nonmembers for the first time since the second quarter of fiscal 2022, according to Niccol.The company's same-store sales growth has continued into January, according to Smith.U.S. same-store sales also rose 4%, fueled by demand for its holiday offerings, like its viral \"Bearista\" cup and classics menu items like the peppermint mocha. In November, Niccol said the holiday menu launch was the best-ever day for the company's North American business.Niccol also credited the company's \"Green Apron Service\" program, which focuses on hospitality and efficiency inside its cafes to improve the customer experience. Outside the U.S., Starbucks' international same-store sales increased 5%.China, the company's second-largest market, saw same-store sales grow 7%. During the quarter, Starbucks announced its plans to form a joint venture with Boyu Capital to run its business in China. \"This partnership will help us expand into more cities, deliver exceptional coffee experiences, create new career opportunities for partners, and strengthen Starbucks' position as a global brand for long-term growth,\" Niccol said on the company's earnings conference call.The deal is expected to close in the second quarter of fiscal 2026, pending regulatory approval. Starbucks' fiscal 2026 forecast assumes that the company will keep operating Starbucks China's retail stores in the second half of the fiscal year.The company also opened 128 net new locations during the quarter.In fiscal 2026, Starbucks plans to open 600 to 650 net new company-owned and licensed cafes. The development comes on the heels of the company shuttering roughly 400 U.S. locations last year.Investors are expecting to hear more details about Niccol's strategy on Thursday at an investor day held in New York City. Executives will also share the company's new long-term financial targets.",

    "body": "A five-month process of finding the next Federal Reserve chair appears to be down to its final days, with one candidate emerging as the betting favorite even as others remain in the mix.BlackRock fixed income chief Rick Rieder is seen by prediction markets as the frontrunner to replace Jerome Powell at the helm of the central bank. Kalshi has the Wall Street veteran holding a 48% chance, well ahead of the next-closest competitor, former Governor Kevin Warsh, at 31%.But sentiment has been volatile, and it was Warsh who held a decided advantage less than a week ago.What has swung the pendulum seems tenuous: In a CNBC interview at the World Economic Forum, Trump called Rieder \"very impressive,\" and a Bloomberg News report, citing unnamed sources, said White House officials generally liked Rieder.While that was enough to sway wagers on sites like Kalshi and Polymarket, some on Wall Street are less convinced and still see it as a competitive race yet to be decided by a notoriously fickle president. With Warsh still well in the mix, some analysts also think the market's move away from National Economic Council (NEC) director Kevin Hassett is at least too hasty.The Kevins are still aliveWhile acknowledging market sentiment about Rieder, Tobin Marcus, head of U.S. policy and politics at Wolfe Research, said in a note that \"we remain unconvinced\" on the money manager, adding, \"We think both Kevins are still strong possibilities.\"\"Just last week, Trump was continuing to strongly emphasize 'loyalty' as a criterion, which is an obstacle for Rieder,\" Marcus added. \"If this is still the President's mindset, that seems like an obvious problem for Rieder, who is in no way a loyalist ... We also continue to think betting markets are misinterpreting Trump's comments on Hassett.\"That's a reference to Trump, in a recent White House conversation with reporters, emphasizing that he would miss Hassett at the NEC and would prefer to see him stay in that role. However, neither Trump nor any White House officials who have spoken about the matter have dismissed Hassett as a contender. Marcus wrote off the Trump comment about Hassett as \"a cheeky quip\" that may not represent his feelings about filling the Fed chair.Former Fed Vice Chair Roger Ferguson voiced similar views in a CNBC interview Monday, saying he still thinks the decision comes down to \"one of the Kevins.\"\"Only one person knows, and the rest of us are speculating,\" Ferguson added. He called Rieder a \"qualified person [and] Wall Street favorite ... but I really think it's unlikely that he'll be the first one across the finish line.\"There's also the possibility that Trump could play a wild card in the form of hiring someone not thought to be among the finalists. He has stated previously that he would like to name Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent to the job but that the former hedge fund manager doesn't want it.Neither Rieder nor White House officials returned a request for comment.Looking at RiederShould he look Rieder's way, Trump would get someone who fits his views in many ways, including a desire for lower interest rates and a willingness to use the Fed's balance sheet to guide the economy.After the Fed approved a quarter percentage point cut in December, the third such move in a row, Rieder wrote, \"rates are still too high for the housing market to [recover] its buoyancy, and small businesses (important providers of new jobs) and young households are still struggling.\" He noted that the fed funds rate \"is excessively blunt to deal with issues better resolved through fiscal channels.\"Rieder would be an interesting choice for a number of reasons, not least because he represents a firm that is the face of globalist finance and would serve under a president known for his anti-globalist views. Though Trump has many times expressed his distaste for Powell and threatened to fire him more than once, Rieder would carry a huge similarity to the current chair in that neither has a PhD in economics, instead holding market-rich backgrounds. In Rieder's case, that meant a long stint at Lehman Brothers before the Wall Street investment banking titan imploded in 2008, an event associated with the beginning of the global financial crisis.At BlackRock, Rieder engineers a $2.5 trillion bond portfolio that includes the $14.5 billion iShares Flexible Income Active exchange-traded fund. The entire firm manages $14 trillion in client money and runs the government's Thrift Savings Plan, a federal employees' retirement fund. Moreover, the Fed called on BlackRock during the Covid crisis in 2020 to manage its controversial purchases of corporate bonds aimed at steadying capital flows at a time of extreme economic peril. Like other major financial firms and primary dealers, BlackRock officials, including its influential CEO Larry Fink, are in continuous contact with the Fed.Fed independencePotential downsides, at least from Trump's view, might be that Rieder has stated he'd like to see the Fed's key interest rate around 3%, only about half a percentage point below its current level and above desired by the president and other White House officials. He has also expressed support for Fed independence and seems unlikely to take marching orders from Trump.In a separate appearance at the World Economic Forum — held each year in Davos, Switzerland, where BlackRock plays a huge role — Trump mused about the difficulty in finding a Fed chair who would do his bidding. Few if any presidents in U.S. history have been so open about trying to influence monetary policy.\"They get the job, they're locked in for six years. They get the job and all of a sudden, 'let's raise rates a little bit,'\" Trump said, misstating the length of the four-year terms for chairs. \"It's amazing how people change once they have the job. It's too bad. It's sort of disloyalty. But they've got to do what they think is right.\"While Trump may again become dissatisfied with the next Fed chair, markets likely will welcome whomever Trump chooses, including Rieder, at least among those considered in the running.\"The BlackRock fixed income CIO, who has not worked in a policy position before, would bring a perspective grounded in deep granular bottoms-up analysis of corporate data rather than economic theory and models,\" wrote Krishna Guha, head of global policy and central bank strategy at Evercore ISI. \"The market would likely welcome Rieder as one of its own.\"",

    "body": "Homes in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida, US, on Sunday, Jan. 11, 2026. Zak Bennett | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesAfter dropping sharply, mortgage interest rates rose last week for the first time in a month. That pushed total mortgage demand down 8.5% compared with the previous week, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association's seasonally adjusted index. The average contract interest rate for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages with conforming loan balances, $832,750 or less, increased to 6.24% from 6.16%, with points rising to 0.55 from 0.54, including the origination fee, for loans with a 20% down payment. That was the highest rate in three weeks.As a result, applications to refinance a home loan dropped 16% for the week, but they were still 156% higher than the same week one year ago. That is because rates a year ago were 78 basis points higher.  \"FHA refinance activity bucked the overall trend and increased, as FHA rates remained almost 20 basis points lower than conforming rates,\" said Joel Kan, MBA's vice president and deputy chief economist, in a release. \"With rates holding in the 6 percent range, the refinance market is likely to remain sensitive to week-to-week rate movements.\" Get Property Play directly to your inboxCNBC's Property Play with Diana Olick covers new and evolving opportunities for the real estate investor, delivered weekly to your inbox.Subscribe here to get access today.Applications for a mortgage to purchase a home were essentially flat, down 0.4% from one week earlier and 18% higher year over year. Homebuyers are still facing a very pricey market. There is more supply than last year, but most of it is on the high end.\"The average loan size stayed at its highest level since September 2025,\" Kan added.Mortgage rates moved slightly lower to start this week, according to a separate survey from Mortgage News Daily. The next chance for a sizeable move in rates in either direction comes Wednesday with the latest meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee. Most expect it to keep its benchmark interest rate unchanged, but markets will be ready to react to commentary from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell.",

    "body": "watch nowPresident Donald Trump has \"brought down the temperature\" on Minnesota, the site of major civil unrest over aggressive federal immigration efforts, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Wednesday.Trump is now \"urging\" Congress to take action to avoid triggering a partial government shutdown amid disputes over federal funding for the Department of Homeland Security, Bessent told CNBC's \"Squawk on the Street.\"The shutdown could begin at 12:01 a.m. ET on Saturday unless lawmakers come to a resolution on the DHS funding, which a slew of Democrats have rejected in light of the recent killing of nurse Alex Pretti by federal agents in Minneapolis.Trump is \"in constant contact\" with lawmakers \"and he is urging them not to shut down the government,\" Bessent told CNBC.The Cabinet secretary declined to make a prediction about whether a shutdown — the second in less than four months — will be averted.\"I don't know what to expect. The Democrats can become unhinged like they were last time, and they don't care. Like, they think this is a way to stop President Trump,\" he said.He also warned that another shutdown could cause further economic harm. \"Especially on the service side, when the government shut down, that never comes back. So, there's a big permanent loss,\" Bessent said.The House of Representatives last week passed a more-than-$1.2 trillion spending package that includes funding for DHS, the agency in charge of federal immigration enforcement.The package, which accounts for the bulk of government spending for the fiscal year ending Sept. 30, requires Democratic support to clear the Senate's 60-vote filibuster threshold.But opposition rapidly grew after Pretti's killing on Saturday morning. Senate Democrats now say they will vote against the package unless the DHS portion is stripped out, something Republicans have signaled they will not do.Pretti's killing came just weeks after another U.S. citizen, Renee Nicole Good, was fatally shot by federal agents in Minneapolis.In both cases, the Trump administration initially came out in full-throated defense of its officers' actions while accusing the slain citizens of domestic terrorism. After widespread blowback — and after new polls showed Trump's immigration approval rating plummeting — the administration has dialed back its tone.Trump said Tuesday, \"we're going to de-escalate a bit\" in Minnesota.But Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., has suggested that that pivot is not enough for Democrats to drop the shutdown threat.\"The fix should come from Congress; the public can't trust the administration to do the right thing on its own,\" Schumer said on the Senate floor.\"In the meantime, I will vote no on any legislation that funds [U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement] until it is reined in and overhauled, and Senate Democrats are overwhelmingly united on this issue,\" Schumer said.This is breaking news.

    "body": "Illustration of the SK Hynix logo displayed on a phone screen. Jakub Porzycki | Nurphoto | Getty ImagesSouth Korean memory giant SK Hynix announced Wednesday that it will set up a new U.S.-based company focused on artificial intelligence solutions, committing at least $10 billion as it seizes on new AI growth engines.The new U.S. entity, tentatively named \"AI Company or AI Co.,\" will serve as a hub for SK Group's AI strategies and work to accelerate the technology in global markets, the company said.SK Hynix has emerged as a major AI player in recent years due to its leadership in high-bandwidth memory (HBM) chips, a type of memory used in AI chipsets like those from Nvidia.The company's U.S. expansion comes as other tech giants intensify investments in AI, driving intense demand for memory chips.SK Hynix said that it will create the new \"AI Company\" by restructuring its California-based subsidiary Solidigm, an enterprise solid-state drive (SSD) manufacturer created in 2021. Solidigm's operations will then be transferred to a new entity named Solidigm Inc.The planned investments in AI Co. are expected to be deployed on a capital-call basis, with plans for further strategic investments in American AI firms to boost synergies across SK Group affiliates.watch nowThe announcement follows SK Hynix's forecast-beating fourth-quarter also announced Wednesday, with profits boosted by ongoing shortages across the memory supply chain that have pushed up prices.To capitalize on this surging AI demand, SK Hynix has been accelerating investments and has also committed nearly $13 billion to build an advanced chip packaging plant in South Korea.The plans for a new entity based in the U.S. also align with the priorities of the Trump administration, which has threatened tariffs on semiconductor manufacturers unless they heavily invest in the U.S.SK Hynix is already in the process of building a $3.87 billion advanced chip packaging fabrication and R&D facility in Indiana, announced back in 2024. The facility will produce high-bandwidth memory (HBM) for AI applications, with operations slated to begin in 2028.U.S. President Donald Trump has also been engaged in broader tariff negotiations with South Korea in recent months. However, the president said on Tuesday that Washington would \"work something out\" with South Korea following his recent tariff threats, signaling a potential easing of trade tensions.",

    "body": "Jensen Huang, chief executive officer of Nvidia Corp., speaks during the 2026 CES event in Las Vegas, Nevada, US, on Tuesday, Jan. 6, 2026. Siemens and Nvidia announced an expansion of their strategic partnership to develop industrial and physical AI solutions to bring AI-driven innovation to industrial workflow. Photographer: Bridget Bennett/Bloomberg via Getty ImagesBloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesChip stocks jumped on Wednesday thanks to strong earnings from heavyweights ASML and SK Hynix and a report that China has approved the sale of Nvidia's H200 chips.The VanEck Semiconductor ETF was up more than 3% in premarket trade.In Europe, ASML was 5% higher in morning trade with other semiconductor firms, including Infineon and STMicro, also in the green.Dutch chipmaker ASML on Wednesday reported bumper fourth-quarter earnings with orders above analyst expectations, while its 2026 sales forecast was also ahead of estimates.South Korea's SK Hynix shares closed more than 5% higher after it reported record full-year profit for 2025. Meanwhile, Reuters reported on Wednesday that China has approved domestic tech giants ByteDance, Alibaba and Tencent to buy Nvidia's H200 system, a critical development in the long-running saga of Nvidia's position in China, a huge market for the company.While the U.S. had said earlier this year it would authorise H200 sales, China was reportedly pushing its companies to buy domestic alternatives. In May, Nvidia said export restrictions to China would cost it $8 billion in lost sales.Nvidia shares were up around 1.6% in premarket trade.watch nowWhat drove earnings?Broader market dynamics helped ASML and SK Hynix's earnings. There is a major shortage of memory chips, which are key components for consumer electronics and data centers. This has led to an unprecedented rise in prices for the components which helped SK Hynix, one of the world's largest memory players.Meanwhile, chip manufacturers are expected to expand production to meet demand for memory and other types of AI-related chips, such as Nvidia's. ASML is the producer of so-called extreme ultraviolet lithography machines which are critical tools to manufacture the most advanced chips in the world. As chipmakers look to expand production, they will require ASML's machines. This demand helped the company report 13.2 billion euros ($15.8 billion) worth of bookings, a key metric for investors.ASML and SK Hynix's financials add to the positive signs in the semiconductor industry in the past few days.Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., the world's largest contract chipmaker, reported record fourth quarter profit earlier this month.",

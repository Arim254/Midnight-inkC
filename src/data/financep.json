    "body": "For many Americans, buying your first home feels like a rite of passage. And while rising home prices and high mortgage rates may make it more difficult to put down roots, there are still favorable markets for first-time buyers that are close to major metropolitan areas like Washington, D.C., and Cleveland, Ohio.A recent report from Realtor.com ranks the best markets for first-time homebuyers. To determine the top markets, the report analyzed over 10,000 locations within the 100 largest metropolitan areas in the U.S., giving each a score out of 10 based on the following components: Affordability (25%)Local amenities (25%)Housing availability (10%)Young peers (10%)Commute quality (10%)Economic health (10%)Housing outlook (10%) Realtor.com then determined the 10 highest-ranking markets with at least 500 active for-sale listings from December 2024 to November 2025. Many of the markets from last year's ranking performed well this year and remain good options for first-time buyers, including Granite City, Illinois, and Birmingham, Alabama, Joel Berner, senior economist at Realtor.com, tells CNBC Make It. \"Affordability remains good, the amenities in the cities remain good and the fact that these prices are remaining attainable for younger owners or would-be owners is really impressive,\" Berner says. On the other hand, this year's ranking saw all Florida markets drop out of the top 10 best places for first-time homebuyers. Berner says the overall Realtor.com forecast for 2026, in terms of price and sales growth, is weak in Florida markets. \"We're expecting a pretty slow year in 2026 in Florida,\" Berner says. \"Even though there are good options there, we don't recommend those this year because we anticipate those homes actually falling in value.\" The report states that the fall in the value of Florida homes is due to softer prices and home sales projections. \"The main driver of price softness in Florida over the past several years is a growing supply of homes for sale at the same time that demand for those homes has weakened a bit,\" Berner said in a 2025 report. Rochester, N.Y., is the No. 1 market for first-time homebuyers Rochester, New York.Copyright Matt Kazmierski | Moment | Getty ImagesRochester, New York, ranked as the top market for first-time homebuyers with a score of 9.3. The median listing price for a home in the New York city is $139,900, which is below the national median of $399,950, according to Realtor.com. Realtor.com forecasts that in 2026, 25- to 34-year-olds will make up 21.3% of homeowners in Rochester. \"Rochester has quite a fair share of listings on the market, so there are a lot of options for buyers,\" Berner says. \"It's a nice town that is also a good place to raise a family.\"The best markets for first-time homebuyersRochester, N.Y.Harrisburg, Pa.Granite City, Ill.Birmingham, Ala.North Little Rock, Ark.Syracuse, N.Y.Baltimore, Md. St. Louis Park, Minn.Pittsburgh, Pa.Garfield Heights, OhioHarrisburg, Pennsylvania, ranked second among the top markets for first-time homebuyers in 2026 with a score of 9.3. The median listing price for a home in Harrisburg is $151,999.Harrisburg, PennsylvaniaRichard T. Nowitz | The Image Bank | Getty ImagesSimilar to Rochester, Berner says Harrisburg is seeing significant growth and offers options for buyers. \"They have more inventory than most places in that part of the country,\" he adds. Having so many midsize markets in the top 10, Berner says, points to the fact that these markets are becoming more popular than really big cities, but aren't necessarily totally rural areas. \"There are a lot of opportunities for young homebuyers to be part of that trend and build up some of these cities even further with young families,\" he says.

    "body": "About a decade ago, Andy Hill was looking for a change.  Hill, now 44, was feeling burnt out at his job in corporate events marketing. While the frequent travel and weekend events were fun while Hill was in his 20s, the gig had begun to lose its luster after he got married and started a family.In 2016, Hill started a side gig hosting the \"Marriage Kids and Money\" podcast, where he and his guests discussed their journeys and stories around family finances. It was around this time that he became interested in FIRE, which is short for \"financial independence, retire early.\"The strategy generally involves saving a high percentage of your income in service of aggressively investing. Save enough, and you can either buy income-producing investments, such as real estate, or begin withdrawing from your stock portfolio to replace income from a 9-to-5 job. Hill was all in. \"I was very interested in FIRE, like traditional FIRE, hard-charging, get me out of here,\" Hill tells CNBC Make It, referring to an early model of FIRE that prioritized slashing expenses to maximize savings and retire quickly. \"I want to save as much as possible, and I don't care what happens now. That did not work well for my life.\"Hill and his wife were saving upwards of 50% of their dual income, often cutting out many of life's niceties to do it. They shopped at lower-cost grocery stores and sold anything around the house they determined they didn't need. If family, friends or colleagues invited them to events that didn't align with a strict budget, they said, \"no thanks.\"In many ways, it worked — the couple wiped out $50,000 in debt and built a portfolio worth $500,000. But when Hill suggested saving even more in order to retire as quickly as he could, money discussions started turning into money fights, he says. \"We did the 'super saver' thing for a while, and that led us into marriage counseling,\" Hill says.Talking in counseling gave Hill and his wife a new approach to managing their marriage — one built on compromise, communication and empathizing with each other's feelings. They also took on a new approach to money, what he and some other financial pros call \"Coast FIRE\": Once you save enough such that your portfolio can grow to where you want it in retirement, you take your foot off the gas, savings-wise, and \"coast.\" It's a philosophy he shares in his new book, \"Own Your Time: 10 Financial Steps to Put Your Family First and Escape the Corporate Grind.\" For couples in particular, he says, taking this approach allows you spend more money — or time — pursuing the things you value in life together. \"[It's about] starting from that position of dreaming personally and then sharing those dreams with your spouse, asking them to do the same, so that you can come together for some cool family goals that work for both of you,\" Hill says. Finding middle groundHill discovered that his aggressive FIRE strategy meant sacrificing on both ends. Not only was the pressure to cut back on spending limiting what the family could do, but his hope to bank as much money as possible meant that work was taking him away from the people he loved.\"I was traveling during my children's birthdays, working with supervisors that graded my performance on how late I could stay at the office and overall, I was giving a lot more time to work than to my health or my family,\" he says.Still, abandoning the strategy seemingly threw a wrench into Hill's hopes of leaving his job for good — his plan was to save enough to invest in rental properties for passive income, he says. Hill's wife suggested that he take the money he'd been saving for rental property and use it to turn his side hustle — something he enjoyed much more than his day job — into a full-fledged business. \"It was this epiphany moment,\" he says. Rather than waiting for the early retirement finish line, he could use some of his savings to buy time and space to pursue his passion. Hill kept his podcast and added financial coaching and speaking engagements, going into business for himself full time in 2020. When he left his job, he was making about $180,000 a year working 40 to 50 hours a week. These days, he pays himself about $100,000, but works about 20 to 25 hours a week. As for his savings rate, \"We found a middle ground,\" Hill says. \"We said, 'Well, we can continue to save and invest, but maybe let's dial it back by like a cool 20, 25% and then dial some of that back into our lifestyle.'\"Unlocking time freedomHill says his shift to a Coast FIRE lifestyle allowed him and his wife to focus on time freedom. If you can build enough of a retirement nest egg, the thinking goes, you can let it grow on the back burner and use money you would have been socking away to enrich your life, either in the form of spending more or finding a different approach to work. \"Do we want to inflate our lifestyle and just have more fun, or do we both want to work less?\" Hill says. \"Wouldn't it be cool to work 20 to 25 hours a week until we're in our 60s and then just enjoy more time now?\"Hill and his wife have both taken the latter approach. The couple had about $500,000 saved by age 40, and have since pumped their net worth up to over $1 million. They've used their financial flexibility to scale back at work. While Hill built his business, his wife realized that she was tired of working for clients at all hours at her marketing agency. \"She said, 'I've always wanted to work with my hands. I've always wanted to do something where when the work day was done, I was done,'\" Hill says. So she went back to school to become an esthetician. Now she works part-time at a dermatologist's office and goes back to her own life when the office closes. The goal, Hill says, is to find the balance between saving for the future and living a fulfilling life now. The two spend Mondays sipping coffee after sending the kids to school and exercising together. Hill cooks family dinner twice a week. They've taken dance classes together and are learning pickleball. \"With that extra 20 to 25 hours that we're not working, we can take care of our health,\" Hill says. \"We can invest time in our marriage so that we're actually having conversations with each other and not being surprised by arguments. We can be more present parents and be there for the important moments for our kids.\"Want to get ahead at work with AI?

    "body": "US President Donald Trump speaks to the press upon returning to Joint Base Andrews in Maryland on January 13, 2026. Mandel Ngan | Afp | Getty ImagesPresident Donald Trump on Saturday warned Canada that the U.S. would impose 100% tariff on goods sold in the U.S. if the country strikes a trade deal with China.\"If Canada makes a deal with China, it will immediately be hit with a 100% Tariff against all Canadian goods and products coming into the U.S.A.,\" the president wrote in a Truth Social post.Trump also suggested Saturday that China would try to use Canada to try to avoid paying U.S. tariffs. \"If Governor Carney thinks he is going to make Canada a 'Drop Off Port' for China to send goods and products into the United States, he is sorely mistaken,\" Trump stated.Earlier this month, Prime Minister Mark Carney announced that Canada and China reached a preliminary deal to remove trade barriers and lower tariffs. Under the tentative agreement, Beijing cut tariffs on some Canadian agricultural products, while Ottawa increased the quotas for imports of Chinese electric vehicles, applying the most-favored-nation tariff rate of 6.1%. Just a week ago, Trump had voiced his support for Carney on the China trade deal.\"That's what he should be doing. It's a good thing for him to sign a trade deal. If you can get a deal with China, you should do that,\" Trump told reporters at the White House on Jan. 16.The White House and the office of the Canadian prime minister didn't immediately respond to a CNBC request for comment.Read more CNBC politics coverageGreenland PM: Trump-NATO deal framework unclear, sovereignty is a red lineTrump sues Jamie Dimon, JPMorgan Chase over debanking the suit calls 'political'Trump says he reached Greenland deal 'framework' with NATO, backs off tariffsTrump interview live updates: CNBC's Joe Kernen sits down with the president at DavosRussia watches as ally Iran edges closer to collapse.

Duties aren't imposed on most Canadian exports under the Canada-U.S.-Mexico Agreement (CUSMA), but some goods, including steel, copper and certain autos and auto parts, are subject to U.S. tariffs. The new tariff threat comes one day after Trump withdrew the invitation to Canada to join his \"Board of Peace\" after Carney's address at the World Economic Forum in Davos that cautioned against economic coercion by the world's superpowers.In his speech, Carney said the world's \"middle powers\" must band together to resist coercion from the world's largest powers.Carney said last week that he intended to join the board but the details hadn't been worked out. States seeking a permanent board seat would have to pay a $1 billion fee.— Reuters contributed to this report.",

    "body": "Signage ahead of the Nvidia Live event at CES 2026 in Las Vegas, Jan. 5, 2026.Bridget Bennett | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesNvidia director Persis Drell, an engineering professor at Stanford, resigned on Wednesday after just over a decade on the chipmaker's board of directors, the company said in a filing with the SEC on Friday. Drell, 70, stepped down to pursue a \"new professional opportunity,\" Nvidia said, and not because of a disagreement with company or any matter related to its operations or policies. Drell, who served on the compensation committee, is the first Nvidia board member to depart since astronaut Ellen Ochoa resigned in June. The board now has 10 directors, including CEO Jensen Huang. Drell owns close to 143,000 Nvidia shares, worth about $26 million, according to the latest holdings report. She was paid about $344,000 for her work with Nvidia last year, including almost $259,000 in stock awards, the company's annual report said. Nvidia's stock price is up over 22,000% since the end of 2015, emerging as the most valuable company in the world thanks to the artificial intelligence boom. Drell sold about 40,000 shares last year. Drell has been a professor at Stanford since 2002, serving as the dean of the engineering school from 2014 to 2017 and as Stanford's provost from 2017 to 2023. She was also director of Stanford's particle accelerator, called SLAC, from 2007 to 2012. Correction: This story has been revised to reflect that Persis Drell is 70 years old.

    "body": "watch nowU.S. President Donald Trump withdrew the invitation to Canada to join his \"Board of Peace,\" days after Prime Minister Mark Carney's address in Davos, warning against economic coercion by the world's superpowers.   \"Dear Prime Minister Carney: Please let this Letter serve to represent that the Board of Peace is withdrawing its invitation to you regarding Canada's joining,\" Trump said in a post on Truth Social on Thursday night stateside. Carney said last week that he intended to join the board but details, including financial terms, had yet to be worked out. States looking for a permanent seat need to pay $1 billion.In his speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, earlier this week, Carney said the world's \"middle powers\" must band together to resist coercion from the world's largest powers. \"Great powers have begun using economic integration as weapons. Tariffs as leverage, financial infrastructure as coercion, supply chains as vulnerabilities to be exploited,\" he said. While Carney did not name any country, Trump responded later, saying on the sidelines of the forum that \"Canada lives because of the United States. Remember that, Mark, the next time you make your statements.\" Hours before Carney's speech, Trump had posted on social media a digitally altered image of a map with Greenland, Venezuela, and Canada covered in an American flag.  Recent events have shown that \"the rules-based international order\" is effectively dead, while the world's superpowers \"pursue their interests using economic integration as a weapon of coercion,\" Carney said in his speech.  Relations between the two longstanding allies have come under heavy strain in Trump's second term, who has referred to the neighboring country as the U.S.'s 51st state, besides targeting it with tariffs. U.S. President Donald Trump (R) meets with Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney in the Oval Office of the White House on October 07, 2025 in Washington, DC. Anna Moneymaker | Getty ImagesThe \"Board of Peace,\" chaired by Trump, was originally conceived to oversee the demilitarization and rebuilding of the Gaza Strip after a two-year war with Israel. But Trump said he foresees the board taking a wider role that could ultimately rival the United Nations, a remit that has alarmed several U.S. allies. Trump has garnered the support from regional Middle East countries, including Turkey, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and Qatar, as well as emerging economies such as Indonesia. But several global powers and traditional Western U.S. allies have been more cautious, including Australia, France, Germany, Italy and some have rejected the proposal. U.K. Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper reportedly said that it \"won't be one of the signatories,\" citing concerns over Russian President Vladimir Putin's invitation to join.  Russia and China are among those invited to join the board.

    "body": "watch nowOil prices rose Friday as President Donald Trump's renewed threats against Iran raise concerns about supply disruptions.Iran is not a major oil producer. The country pumps about 3.4 million barrels per day, according to Kpler. That number pales in comparison with the U.S. and Saudi Arabia, which pump about 13.5 million barrels per day and 9.5 million barrels per day, respectively, according to data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration and OPEC.Yet a recent wave of protests in Iran spurred by the plummet in the nation's rial currency and Trump's subsequent suggestions that the U.S. could take military action in the country have rocked energy markets.\"Oil markets are moving on fear,\" Helima Croft, global head of commodity strategy at RBC Capital Markets, told CNBC. \"It's basically a concern about disruption.\"Market anxiety grew Friday as tensions between Iran and the U.S. escalated. \"We're watching Iran,\" Trump told reporters Thursday. \"You know we have a lot of ships going in that direction just in case. We have a big flotilla going in that direction and we'll see what happens.\"Trump's comments come as more than 5,000 people have died in Iran since the protests began on Dec. 28, according to the Human Rights Activists News Agency. \"They were going to hang 837 people,\" Trump said in an interview with CNBC on Wednesday. \"And I told them, you can't do that. If you do that, it's going to be bad.\" While the market is well supplied for the time being, OPEC and its allies, which pump about 40% of the world's oil, hiked their output last year, cutting into spare capacity.\"If we were to get a confrontation between the U.S. and Iran that led to the loss of Iranian oil exports, there just isn't a lot left in the OPEC tank to cover that,\" Croft said. Concerns around a larger regional conflict have also lifted prices given Iran's proximity to some of the world's largest oil producers -- namely Saudi Arabia.\"Iran's location is strategically very important when we think about critical waterways like the Strait of Hormuz, which is a major chokepoint for oil, and we have seen Iran and Iranian-backed groups before target tankers and target critical infrastructure in the Gulf,\" said Croft. In 2019, Iran launched a series of attacks on oil tankers in the Strait of Hormuz. About 20% of global crude flows through the narrow waterway, according to the EIA.Despite pulling back threats of military intervention, Trump confirmed to CNBC on Wednesday that 25% tariffs on countries doing business with Iran are \"going forward.\"Existing sanctions on Iran have already hampered the country's crude exports, with the vast majority going to independent Chinese refiners that buy the oil at a discount to benchmark prices.\"Can you really squeeze Iran much more given where their barrels are going?\" said Croft. \"[Have] sanctions now lost [the] ability to kind of move the needle when it comes to Iranian policy?\"Watch the video above to learn more about Iran's impact on oil markets and what it could mean for consumers.",

    "body": "I spent the last three years of my life researching money and wealth.During that time, I developed and battle-tested my own set of money principles, mindsets, tips, guardrails, and tools that helped me build a life that feels truly abundant.Here are 25 money rules I'm following to live a wealthy life.1. Avoid errorsYou can get pretty damn far by just avoiding errors: silly impulse purchases, avoidable debt, emotional investing, neglected responsibilities. Slow down, think clearly, and protect yourself from…yourself. 2. Never allow self-worth to be dictated by net worthMarkets fluctuate. Seasons change. Businesses rise and fall. Your sense of worth must be anchored in something deeper: character, values, relationships, interests, service.3. Track progress You can't improve what you don't track. Use a financial tracking and management tool to get a clear picture.4. Live below your meansManage financial expectations by keeping your lifestyle well below your means, creating slack in the system, and never matching an economic leap forward with a lifestyle one.5. Focus on value, impact, and serviceThe people who do the best financially are usually the ones who obsess over solving real problems, creating real impact, or genuinely helping others. 6. Treat income as the leverage pointThe return on improving your skills, expanding your scope, building new earning streams, or stepping into higher-impact roles dwarfs the difference between a 6% or 8% market return.7. Spend more for quality, not for brandWhen purchasing products for their utility, always invest a bit more and opt for quality. They'll last longer and create fewer headaches. 8. Ignore external expectationsThe world is full of silent scripts about what you should buy, achieve, or own by certain ages. Most of them are complete nonsense. Your life is not a race with anyone else. There are no timelines. You get to create your own.9. Debt is a tool, but use it sparinglyNever use debt to live a life you can't truly afford. A simple rule I follow: Never finance a luxury material purchase if you can't buy it twice over in cash. 10. Follow a 24-hour rule for non-essential purchases above a certain thresholdThis reduces impulse purchases and improves saving and investing rates. If you still want to buy the thing after 24 hours, go for it.11. Consider time and moneyThere are some investments that require money and no time (index funds) and some that require money and a lot of time (active multi-family real estate). Make sure you consider both when evaluating returns on an opportunity.12. Remember that returns come in many formsEarly in my career, I started making angel investments in early stage technology companies. On paper, it didn't make a lot of sense: I didn't have much excess capital and I knew that most of the startups would fail. But what they lacked in financial returns, they made up for in access, networks, and learning.13. Never think twice about investments in yourselfThere are a lot of things that look like expenses but are better regarded as investments in yourself: fitness, quality food, books, personal development, mental health, etc. You'll have more energy, feel better, and show up better in the world.14. Never use money to optimize the life out of your lifeWhen you start making more money, an entire menu of options materializes to reduce life's minor frictions. You can hire a personal chef, a full-time cleaner, a staff, or a driver. But sometimes that friction was what created meaning. Cherish the meaningful friction in your life.15. Check in with your partnerMoney trouble rarely comes from math. It comes from misalignment. A monthly financial check-in creates transparency, trust, and shared direction. Focus on values. What matters this month? What doesn't? 16. Focus on expanding your savings rateEven small percentage increases have an outsized long-term impact when you consider the magic of compounding.17. Work toward a 12-month emergency fundIt may seem excessive, but there's value in peace of mind. Knowing you have that financial security allows you to see and capitalize on exciting opportunities when they come. 18. Run quarterly disaster simulationsYour willingness to imagine bad times during good times is what allows you to safely navigate them. What if you lost your job? What if you had a major healthcare expense? 19. Don't waste energy Bestselling financial author Ramit Sethi says people ask $3 questions (can I buy this coffee?) when what truly matters are $30,000 questions (how can I earn twice as much?). I see friends spending countless hours thinking about optimizing credit card points when they could be thinking about how to get promoted three times in the next year. Unless it brings you joy — some people love the game of credit card points — skip them.20. Consider a barbell approach to your investmentsA barbell has weights on the ends with nothing in between. A barbell investment approach would have the vast majority of your investments on the safe, simple, and steady side (e.g., index funds, bonds, cash) with the remainder having a high-risk, high-reward profile (e.g., startups, crypto). The goal is to get some exposure to the high rewards of the risky stuff, but without taking on too much risk because it's a small portion of your overall financial pie.21. SimplifyAccounts everywhere, investments you don't understand, obligations you can't track. This is how people lose control. Automate, consolidate, and reduce unnecessary friction. The simpler the system, the more likely you are to stay the course.22. Automate payments for recurring expensesEliminate the cognitive burden to free up headspace for executing on bigger opportunities that can help you earn more.23. Conduct a quarterly auditI've found hundreds of dollars in monthly burn through random subscriptions I never use and didn't know I had. Use your financial tracking tool to find and eliminate these.24. Tip generously whenever you canBe frugal with yourself and generous with others. Generosity creates significantly more happiness than consumption. 25. Use money as a tool for more meaningful forms of wealthI believe the best uses of money are those that create one of four things in your life: time, experiences with people you love, purpose, or health.Sahil Bloom is an entrepreneur, investor, and inspirational writer and content creator who writes the biweekly newsletter, The Curiosity Chronicle.

    "body": "Delroy Lindo, finally an Academy Award-nominated actor, only had to wait five decades to earn the honor — overcoming \"strategic missteps\" that once threatened to derail his career along the way, he's said.Lindo, 73, is a longtime character actor whose appearances on film, television and stage have earned him critical acclaim, even as his industry's highest honors eluded him. On Thursday, Lindo earned his first Oscar nomination, in the Best Supporting Actor category, for his work in the 2025 blockbuster \"Sinners.\" The nomination comes five years after some of the actor's supporters complained that he'd been \"snubbed\" by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences for his work in the Spike Lee film \"Da 5 Bloods.\"Lindo was \"profoundly disappointed\" by getting shut out of the 2021 Oscar nominations for that role, he told Entertainment Weekly on Thursday. Lee, an Oscar-winner himself, also expressed disappointment over Lindo's lack of awards recognition, commenting in March 2021 on Instagram that it \"does not take away from the impact of his work that spans decades.\"Before his Oscars nomination, the actor had a long, well-respected career that included acclaimed performances in notable films such as \"The Cider House Rules\" and the Lee-directed \"Malcolm X\" and \"Crooklyn.\" Still, Lindo has lamented his career floundering for multiple years in the mid-1990s as he developed a reputation as being a \"difficult\" actor to work with, he's said.\"I made some strategic missteps. One of the biggest missteps was probably thinking that I was important,\" Lindo told The Hollywood Reporter in March 2021, discussing why high-profile roles \"dried up\" for him nearly three decades ago. He'd bring passion and intensity to his work, occasionally leading him to butt heads with directors when their creative visions didn't fully align, he said.At one point, Lindo walked away from a Lee-produced film over concerns about the script, leading to a nearly 25-year pause between collaborations for the actor and director, Lindo told GQ in April 2021. He might've walked away from acting altogether if fellow actor Denzel Washington hadn't talked him out of the idea, telling Lindo he was \"too good\" an actor to quit, Lindo said at a \"Sinners\" screening in December 2025, according to Deadline.\"That period had to do with these various missteps that I made, which resulted in perhaps being seen as less viable as a film actor, less desirable,\" Lindo told GQ. \"Was that frustrating and painful? Absolutely. I was playing catch-up.\"Ultimately, Lindo came to the realization that he needed to adjust his approach to collaboration, rather than hoping his acting talent would be enough to keep landing him high-profile work, he told THR.\"I thought it was a meritocracy, that good work would beget more good work. No, not quite,\" said Lindo. \"I also was not as strategic or as diplomatic as I could have been in certain situations. I needed to communicate in a way that could not be perceived as either ungrateful or bigheaded.\"Communication expert: 'Don't think of them as conflict conversations'Effective communication is a key skill that can make or break anyone's career, some experts say. Mastering the art of having tough conversations at work — like raising a constructive criticism with a colleague or respectfully disagreeing with your boss — can help you get ahead in your career without alienating others, workplace expert Henna Pryor told CNBC Make It on Aug. 21.Try reframing those conversations as opportunities to seek clarity, rather than as confrontations, Pryor recommended. \"So much comes down to how we prime and frame [conversations],\" she said. \"I don't think of them as conflict conversations. I think of them as clarify conversations. I am seeking clarity about an issue, about why we're disagreeing.\"Lindo didn't specify exactly how he's adapted his approach to be more diplomatic when expressing his creative opinions at work, but he's returned to landing notable acting roles. In addition to his roles in \"Da 5 Bloods\" and \"Sinners,\" Lindo also landed a recurring role on the Emmy Award-nominated Paramount+ series \"The Good Fight\" between 2017 and 2021.Now, Lindo is up for an award that many actors spend their entire lives and careers chasing. After enduring the ups and downs of his own career, Lindo says he's still letting the honor sink in.\"It feels terrific,\" Lindo said on ABC's \"Good Morning America\" on Friday. \"I'm still processing, if I'm really honest, but it's wonderful.\"Want to get ahead at work with AI?

    "body": "watch nowThe sudden collapse last fall of a string of American companies backed by private credit has thrust a fast-growing and opaque corner of Wall Street lending into the spotlight.Private credit, also known as direct lending, is a catch-all term for lending done by nonbank institutions. The practice has been around for decades but surged in popularity after post-2008 financial crisis regulations discouraged banks from serving riskier borrowers. That growth — from $3.4 trillion in 2025 to an estimated $4.9 trillion by 2029 — and the September bankruptcies of auto-industry firms Tricolor and First Brands have emboldened some prominent Wall Street figures to raise alarms about the asset class.JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon warned in October that problems in credit are rarely isolated: \"When you see one cockroach, there are probably more.\" Billionaire bond investor Jeffrey Gundlach a month later accused private lenders of making \"garbage loans\" and predicted that the next financial crisis will come from private credit.While fears about private credit have subsided in recent weeks in the absence of more high-profile bankruptcies or losses disclosed by banks, they haven't lifted completely.Companies that are most linked to the asset class, such as Blue Owl Capital, as well as alternative asset giants Blackstone and KKR, still trade well below their recent highs.The rise of private creditPrivate credit is \"lightly regulated, less transparent, opaque, and it's growing really fast, which doesn't necessarily mean there's a problem in the financial system, but it is a necessary condition for one,\" Moody's Analytics chief economist Mark Zandi said in an interview. Private credit's boosters, such as Apollo co-founder Marc Rowan, have said that the rise of private credit has fueled American economic growth by filling the gap left by banks, served investors with good returns and made the broader financial system more resilient.Big investors including pensions and insurance companies with long-term liabilities are seen as better sources of capital for multiyear corporate loans than banks funded by short-term deposits, which can be flighty, private credit operators told CNBC. But concerns about private credit — which tend to come from the sector's competitors in public debt — are understandable given its attributes.After all, it's the asset managers making private credit loans that are the ones valuing them, and they can be motivated to delay the recognition of potential borrower problems. \"The double-edged sword of private credit\" is that the lenders have \"really strong incentives to monitor for problems,\" said Duke Law professor Elisabeth de Fontenay.\"But by the same token … they do in fact have incentives to try to disguise risk, if they think or hope that there might be some way out of it down the road,\" she said.De Fontenay, who has studied the impact of private equity and debt on corporate America, said her biggest concern is that it's difficult to know if private lenders are accurately marking their loans, she said.\"This is a market that is extraordinarily large and that is reaching more and more businesses, and yet it's not a public market,\" she said. \"We're not entirely sure if the valuations are correct.\"In the November collapse of home improvement firm Renovo, for instance, BlackRock and other private lenders deemed its debt to be worth 100 cents on the dollar until shortly before marking it down to zero.Defaults among private loans are expected to rise this year, especially as signs of stress among less creditworthy borrowers emerge, according to a Kroll Bond Rating Agency report.And private credit borrowers are increasingly relying on payment-in-kind options to forestall defaulting on loans, according to Bloomberg, which cited valuation firm Lincoln International and its own data analysis.Ironically, while they are competitors, part of the private credit boom has been funded by banks themselves.Finance frenemiesAfter investment bank Jefferies, JPMorgan and Fifth Third disclosed losses tied to the auto industry bankruptcies in the fall, investors learned the extent of this form of lending. Bank loans to non-depository financial institutions, or NDFIs, reached $1.14 trillion last year, per the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.On Jan. 13, JPMorgan disclosed for the first time its lending to nonbank financial firms as part of its fourth-quarter earnings presentation. The category tripled to about $160 billion in loans in 2025 from about $50 billion in 2018.Banks are now \"back in the game\" because deregulation under the Trump administration will free up capital for them to expand lending, Moody's Zandi said. That, combined with newer entrants in private credit, might lead to lower loan underwriting standards, he said.\"You're seeing a lot of competition now for the same type of lending,\" Zandi said. \"If history is any guide, that's a concern ... because it probably argues for a weakening in underwriting and ultimately bigger credit problems down the road.\"While neither Zandi nor de Fontenay said they saw an imminent collapse in the sector, as private credit continues to grow, so will its importance to the U.S. financial system.When banks hit turbulence because of the loans they made, there is an established regulatory playbook, but future problems in the private realm might be harder to resolve, according to de Fontenay.\"It raises broader questions from the perspective of the safety and soundness of the overall system,\" de Fontenay said. \"Are we going to know enough to know when there are signs of problems before they actually occur?\"",

REUTERS/Manuel OrbegozoManuel Orbegozo | ReutersMeta's deprioritizing virtual reality in favor of artificial intelligence and Internet-connected smart glasses has chilled the industry, leading to concerns about its future. \"I can see how it feels like a VR winter,\" said Jessica Young, an independent VR content creator specializing in Horizon Worlds, Meta's virtual social network. The social media giant last week laid off 10% of employees who work within its Reality Labs unit, with the cuts centering on VR-related initiatives like the Quest VR headsets, CNBC reported. Teams working on  Horizon Worlds were hit hard and some in-house studios were shuttered. Approximately 1,000 jobs were cut, CNBC reported. The move was part of the company's effort to redirect Reality Labs investments from VR to AI and wearable devices like the Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses that are co-produced with EssilorLuxottica, a spokesperson for the social media company said in a statement last week. Meta declined to comment further beyond its previous statement.Meta's reduced investment in VR is notable considering how much the company has helped grow the industry since its $2 billion acquisition of Oculus in 2014. The company became synonymous with VR when CEO Mark Zuckerberg changed its name from Facebook to Meta, representing the founder's obsession with a future of digital worlds referred to as the metaverse. Since late 2020, Meta's Reality Labs division has logged over $70 billion in cumulative losses.Zuckerberg's sudden reversal has some VR developers worried about their future prospects. While they said they don't see Meta killing its VR efforts, a major shift appears to be underway.

David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesMeta traditionally announces new Quest VR headsets during its annual Connect conference in the fall, but in 2025, the company skimped on VR hardware. Instead, Meta introduced its $799 Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses that contain a single, built-in digital screen. \"If Meta's not putting out a new headset for another year or two, it's going to feel stale,\" Young said. \"It already kind of does.\"Since the layoffs, Meta tech chief Andrew Bosworth has been vocal that the social media giant is not abandoning VR.\"We're still continuing to invest heavily in this space, but obviously, VR is growing less quickly than we hoped,\" Bosworth told tech newsletter Sources. \"And so you want to make sure that your investment is right-sized.\"Bosworth this week also circulated a post by Oculus co-founder Palmer Luckey, who on Sunday wrote on X that Meta still employs the \"largest team working on VR by about an order of magnitude.\" Although Luckey said that he feels \"really bad for the people impacted\" by the layoffs, the Reality Labs changes represent \"a good thing thing for the long-term health of the industry, especially the ongoing incentives.\"'The market has spoken'Market research firm IDC said in a December report that a major transition is occurring in the so-called Extended Reality, or XR, device segment. This category includes VR and so-called mixed-reality headsets that allow users to switch between virtual environments and see their surroundings outside the helmet. The category also counts AI-powered smart glasses and more powerful versions with digital displays.IDC projects the XR device category to have grown 41.6% year-over-year to 14.5 million units shipped for 2025. But that growth has nothing to do with VR and mixed-reality headsets — those shipments are expected to drop 42.8% to 3.9 million in 2025. The rest of this XR category, which includes AI glasses with and without displays, is projected to grow 211.2% year-over-year to 10.6 million units shipped for 2025.Jitesh Ubrani, a research manager for market analyst firm IDC, characterized the VR headset market as niche and appealing to only a small segment of video gamers. Average consumers seem uninterested in wearing \"big, bulky headsets\" for lengthy VR sessions like much of the tech industry hoped for roughly a decade ago, he said.\"The market has spoken,\" Ubrani said. \"There are certain niche audiences that will continue to use these headsets, but it's not going to be broadly appealing.\"Visitors experience the new AR+AI glasses flagship product at the XREAL booth at WAIC 2025 in Shanghai, China, on July 27, 2025. Costfoto | Nurphoto | Getty ImagesAndrew Eiche, the CEO of the Google-owned VR gaming studio Owlchemy Labs, said it was always misguided to think VR was on the cusp of having its breakthrough smartphone moment. He called it a \"strategic mistake\" to compare VR headsets to iPhones The VR market, Eiche said, more closely resembles old-school Atari video game consoles that were popular before sales crashed during an infamous 1983 gaming market meltdown. It wasn't until the late 1980s that Nintendo consoles helped revive the market, laying the groundwork for the overall industry to balloon to the massive sector it is today.\"Lot of tech people thought [VR] was going to be instantly amazing, and the same thing's happening with AI,\" Eiche said about the tech industry's pivot to the latest craze. \"When you're looking at long-term technologies, VR is not going anywhere.\"Still, Eiche said that beyond Meta's layoffs, other VR studios have also recently downsized as part of a broader video game industry slump. Because Quest is the dominant VR headset on the market, its app store is a key distribution channel for third-party VR.Making matters worse, Eiche said that Meta's Horizon Worlds push came at the expense of third-party developers who were trying to find visibility among Quest users.\"We're at the mercy of Meta,\" Eiche said, adding that it \"creates a situation where if Meta pulls back, we all pull back.\" Eiche said he's optimistic that the upcoming Steam Frame wireless VR headset from gaming company Valve will help the market, as well as the recent entries of other devices like the Samsung Galaxy XR, which debuted in October, and Apple's Vision Pro. But Apple's entry into the VR space in February 2024 hasn't done much to move the needle, and in January, IDC said that Apple's Chinese manufacturing partner Luxshare stopped producing new Vision Pro headsets, signaling a lack of widespread consumer demand. Still, Ubrani said that Apple's $3,499 spatial computing headset has found some footing as a business tool.\"Apple did do well in selling to a lot of developers, but they also sold into some very big companies,\" Ubrani said.watch nowVR's hope shifts to the enterprise market\"There were certain quarters where Apple beat Meta in enterprise,\" Ubrani said, due in part to the iPhone-maker's experience selling devices to businesses. The enterprise VR market may not be as glamorous as its consumer counterpart, but it represents an area where IDC has \"seen slow but upwards movement, because companies are realizing that there is great ROI attached with deploying these headsets.\"As part of Meta's Reality Labs cuts, the company said in a support page that it would end its Horizon managed services program that was for businesses that used Quest headsets for internal tasks like virtual employee trainings.Meta failed to realize \"how big VR could be if they adopted the bigger picture outside of gaming,\" said Sean Mann, CEO of the startup RP1, which develops a \"metaverse browser\" for people to access virtual and augmented reality environments. As Meta downsizes its VR ambitions and steers Horizon Worlds to be a mobile-focused online gaming platform like Roblox, Young said she plans to keep creating experiences on the platform. Young has been able to make a living by getting paid by other Horizon developers to create trailers to promote experiences available to users on the service. She's also earned money from Meta by winning Horizon-related competitions intended to help improve the overall platform.But Young said she's less enthusiastic about Horizon's mobile push, because there was something special about the platform during its earlier, VR-centric years, particularly during the Covid era. \"Horizon became a lifeline for people isolated by the pandemic, disability, age or geography,\" she said. \"Many users who never imagined themselves as creators, who had no background in art or programming, were inspired by their friends to try.\"But Horizon lost is way, and \"what's frustrating now is watching people declare it dead without ever having experienced or understanding what it was,\" Young said.

(Photo by Sean Gallup/Getty Images)Sean Gallup | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesA former official of U.S. President Donald Trump's first administration is planning a multi-billion-dollar data center project in a remote corner of Greenland, as hyperscalers scramble to build out capacity across the globe to keep up with the AI rollout.The data center is aiming to be operational at 300 megawatts (MW) by mid-2027, before further expansion would see it hit 1.5 gigawatts (GW) by the end of 2028.While that's currently several times the power capacity of any active data center in the world, there are plans to build multiple 1 GW-plus facilities across the globe over the next two years as the race to develop AI infrastructure continues to gather pace.The Greenland data center project will cost billions of dollars to complete and has binding commitments with investors to finance half of its initial phase of development and half of the final phase, Drew Horn, a senior aide to Trump's first-term vice president Mike Pence and CEO of GreenMet, a company that's offering strategic support to the project, told CNBC. The venture is eyeing a buildout in the Kangerlussuaq area, a small settlement at the end of a deep fjord on the southwest coast of the Arctic island, with an airport, he added.Technical partners have been enlisted to help with the physical buildout, but the project has yet to secure land or approvals from the local authorities, Horn said. He declined to share the names of the other companies involved in the venture because the information isn't public yet.Commercial opportunities in Greenland have been thrust into the spotlight in recent weeks as the Arctic island has become the center of a geopolitical firestorm after U.S. President Donald Trump doubled down on acquisition talk. Critical minerals mining and freshwater reserves have been touted as potential prospects, though skeptics point to logistical challenges around tapping into them with Greenland's limited infrastructure.  watch nowMulti-billion-dollar data centerData center deals hit a record $61 billion in 2025 amid a rush to build out the infrastructure needed to power energy-intensive AI workloads. Big tech firms, including Meta, OpenAI, Oracle, AWS, Microsoft and Google are investing huge sums into developing facilities across the globe. Work on plans for the Greenland data center project began a year ago, and Horn told CNBC it has secured technical partners to assist with construction, operation and supplying energy.Committed financing, which is in the form of debt and equity, is contingent on the project meeting key milestones, including securing permits from local government, said Horn — who was also a senior advisor to both the energy and intelligence departments towards the end of Trump's first term.Other former senior Trump employees also have stakes in GreenMet, which says on its website that it helps companies with government and private funding and strategic partnerships.  George Sorial, who was an executive vice president and chief compliance counsel at the Trump Organization until 2019, and Keith Schiller, who was a longtime bodyguard for Trump and director of Oval Office operations during the U.S. president's first term, helped set up the company in 2021 and remain shareholders.\"We are not actively involved with GreenMet or Greenland,\" Sorial told CNBC. \"We are passive minority shareholders in GreenMet and have no management role in the company.\" Schiller had not responded to a CNBC request for comment as this story went live.The GreenMet CEO has been developing relationships with officials in the Greenlandic and Danish administrations as he looks to advance the project. He met the Danish Ambassador to the U.S. Jesper Møller Sørensen on Wednesday, as part of a \"continuing dialogue,\" to discuss the data center, Horn said. CNBC has approached Denmark's U.S. embassy for comment.While officials on all sides have been supportive of the project, the \"issue is not so much on the private side, it's on the diplomatic,\" Horn said, pointing to the geopolitical tensions surrounding the U.S. push to acquire Greenland, a semi-autonomous Danish territory.Tensions have cooled since Trump backtracked on plans to impose tariffs on several European nations over the issue, but questions still remain as negotiations around U.S. military and economic involvement in Greenland continue.\"Our effort, which is purely private, it succeeds only if we have the buy-in from the relevant affected parties and countries,\" Horn said.Securing power\"Larger corporate entities\" will be taking the lead on the construction and development of the data center, but GreenMet will continue to be involved as an advisor as the project looks to secure government investment from nations including the U.S., Greenland, Denmark, and other NATO countries, Horn told CNBC. \"We've spent about a year putting together everything from the power to the technology components, [and] we have a Greenlandic partner on the ground,\" Horn said. \"Right now we're waiting on approvals from the Greenlandic side.\"A big challenge for projects of this scale in Greenland is access to power. For the first phase of the project, which is targeting 300 MW power capacity, the plan is to use specialized barges carrying Liquefied Natural Gas to the fjord, Horn said.The venture plans to build a hydroelectric facility — 70% of the island's energy comes from such facilities — to power the second phase, which would see the data center hit 1.5 GW capacity. Permits and approvals from the Greenlandic government are still pending for both the barges and the facility. Greenland's Ministry of Business has been approached for comment.Kangerlussuaq Fjord. Large iceberg in scenic fjord surrounded by snow-capped mountains, Southeast coast, Greenland.Vw Pics | Universal Images Group | Getty ImagesHorn argues that if local authorities greenlight the large hydroelectric facility, energy prices will make the project commercially viable long-term. There are some significant advantages to building data centers in an environment with low temperatures, analysts told CNBC.\"The biggest value sits in its resource profile, specifically in hydro for electricity generation and a 'free cooling' proposition given the lower ambient temperature,\" Noah Ramos, strategist at investment research firm Alpine Macro, told CNBC.But there are hurdles the project will have to overcome. \"Building in the Arctic is capital intensive; construction seasons are short, and the heat from the servers can melt the very ground the building sits on... specialized engineering is needed,\" Ramos said.Nvidia is also touting a new generation of chips that require less cooling. \"It's early days, but if future generations of chips are even more efficient in this regard, it could negate the need for expensive data centre build outs in places like Greenland,\" Michael Field, chief equity strategist at Morningstar, told CNBC.watch now",

    "body": "watch nowElon Musk's pay package of up to $1 trillion highlights the continued escalation in CEO compensation, even as worker pay slows and rewards to shareholders remain mixed, according to several studies.  Already, Musk is the richest person on the planet with a net worth that tops $660 billion, according to Bloomberg. Musk saw his 2018 Tesla pay package -- now valued at over $130 billion -- reinstated in December, and his company SpaceX looks set to for a potential public offering in 2026. Those two events could well put Musk on his way to becoming the world's first trillionaire this year. In addition, his new pay package, valued at up to $1 trillion, could also start paying out over the next decade.While Musk may be an outlier, his stock-fueled gains highlight the booming compensation and wealth gains of CEOs in recent decades that has been driven by rising stock markets and a broader adoption of stock-centric pay packages Over the past 50 years, top CEO compensation has climbed 1,094%, according to the Economic Policy Institute. That compares to a 26% increase in typical worker compensation. Median total compensation for S&P 500 CEO's was $17.1 million in 2024, up nearly 10% from 2023, according to Equilar, a corporate analytics firm. CEOs now make 192 times more than the average employee, up from a 186 to 1 ratio in 2023. Tesla CEO Elon Musk attends the Saudi-U.S. Investment Forum, in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, May 13, 2025. Hamad I Mohammed | ReutersDriving the acceleration in CEO pay is a shift in the types of stock awards used to incentivize and reward corporate chiefs. CEO compensation typically includes four categories: salaries, long-term incentives, short-term incentives and perks. Long-term and short-term incentives are largely stock awards, and make up far and away the largest portion of CEO compensation. Stock awards accounted for 72% of CEO pay packages in 2024, with the median value increasing 15% that year, according to Equilar. Musk's trillion-dollar pay package, for instance, doesn't include any salary. The potential value of the $1 trillion would come entirely from stock awards pegged to various targets. For Musk to get the full payout, Tesla must hit key milestones, including certain market capitalization and operational achievements. He could still earn billions in stock even if Tesla doesn't meet all the targets.\"Milestone achievements built into CEO pay packages could be the norm in the future,\" said Amit Batish, senior director marketing at Equilar.Company boards and CEOs themselves say that because their pay is tied closely to stock performance, their compensation reflects the larger wealth created for shareholders. The CEO only does well if shareholders do well, they argue. If stocks plummet, CEO's can also see big pay drops. Others others argue that CEO's have only a partial impact on their companies' share price. A 2021 MSCI study of top executive pay between 2006 and 2020 found a weak correlation between higher CEO pay and company performance. \"This notion that the guy in the corner office is somehow almost single handedly responsible for company value, and everyone else is just little minions who don't contribute much of anything ... everyone can see that is not true,\" said Sarah Anderson, at the Institute for Policy Studies. Tesla's Optimus robots walk on the day of an unveiling event in Los Angeles, California, U.S. October 10, 2024, in this still image taken from a video.Tesla | Via ReutersAccording to the 2021 MSCI study, average performing CEO's took home only 4% less in realized pay than top-performing CEOs. More importantly, CEO's with the lowest awarded pay saw the strongest returns for shareholders.\"When we measured pay and performance against CEO tenure, we found little evidence that high CEO pay achieved this lofty goal of CEO incentivization,\" according to MSCI, an investment research firm.Since the 1990s, company boards have shifted away from stock options, which incentivize short-term performance, with stock awards, which boards argue are driven by longer-term incentives. Shareholders of publicly traded companies can now vote in an advisory capacity on CEO pay, known as \"say on pay\" votes, but company boards have final say when it comes to compensation packages.While restraining CEO pay has proven ineffective, given the natural \"ratcheting up\" of median CEO pay by board compensation committees, some economists advocate more stock awards for employees to help close the gap between employees and CEOs. Employee Stock Ownership Plans, or ESOPs, for instance, are qualified retirement plans that give employees shares in the company through a trust. Employees who can partake in ESOPs tend to end up with better financial security, said Loren Rodgers, executive director of the National Center for Employee Ownership. That in turn benefits their companies, he said. \"Employee-owned businesses are more productive,\" Rodgers said. \"They're more able to recruit people. People quit at lower rates. They're more competitive.\"Watch the video above to hear more about the uptick in CEO pay and what is driving these massive pay outs.",

    "body": "CNBC's Jim Cramer alerted investors on Friday that next week will be a consequential one for Wall Street, pointing to a heavy load of quarterly earnings and a Federal Reserve meeting.\"Make no mistake, next week matters,\" Cramer said. He later added, \"The bottom line? Mag Sevens. Momentum pays. Red-hot industrials, and a Fed meeting. All in front of you. Keep your head up, [there's] much more to come.\"Monday brings earnings from steel manufacturer Nucor, which Cramer described as the \"best steel company in the world.\" Despite Nucor sharing a lackluster mid-quarter update in December, the stock has nevertheless rallied since then, in part because investors hope rate cuts will help spur economic growth. If Nucor gets hit following the release Monday, Cramer said investors should consider buying into the weakness.On Tuesday, Boeing and General Motors will release results. Boeing shares have rallied substantially over the past two months, so Cramer believes investors shouldn't expect another huge leg up after the report. Don't sell the stock just yet though, he said, because it's only year one of the aircraft maker's turnaround story. Meanwhile, Cramer said General Motors CEO Mary Barra hasn't received enough credit for all she's done to revamp the company. If the stock gets dinged on earnings day, Cramer said it could be a solid time to buy.Wednesday is an especially busy earnings day. Corning, Danaher, Starbucks, GE Vernova, Meta Platforms, and Microsoft – all holdings in Cramer's Charitable Trust, the portfolio used by CNBC Investing Club – will release results. Cramer isn't expecting a huge move higher from GE Vernova when the gas turbine maker's results come out Wednesday morning. \"I love it long-term, but the expectations are sky-high for the moment,\" Cramer said. \"I think you need a better entry point.\" After nearly doubling in 2025, shares of GE Vernova are up less than 1% so far in 2026. Like GE Vernova, Cramer said Corning is another great stock to own long-term because it benefits from AI tailwinds, specifically copper being replaced by fiber optics.In the case of Danaher, Cramer said he believes this could be the company's first truly strong quarter in years. A resurgence in biotech orders is a boon for Danaher, which provides the picks and shovels used in drug discovery and manufacturing. Cramer said he's worried that Starbucks is heading into earnings \"wildly overbought,\" which means it will take \"insanely strong\" numbers to keep propelling shares higher. However, \"I do like it for the long-haul, [and we're] not going anywhere,\" he said.Cramer said he believes Microsoft shares have been under pressure into earnings — along with the rest of the software cohort — on AI-driven disruption risks. Cramer described this as a false worry, though. Meanwhile, when Meta reports, Wall Street will be paying close attention to what CEO Mark Zuckerberg has to say about the Facebook parent's return on investment in artificial intelligence. On Thursday, Wall Street will hear from Honeywell, one of the industrial stocks that have been on a roll lately. That's a difficult setup that could result in a disappointing stock reaction, he argued, especially since investors are still awaiting the conglomerate's breakup later this year.Later that day, Apple will post results. The tech stock has been down for eight consecutive weeks, in part due to concerns about higher memory costs squeezing Apple's margins. Cramer isn't changing his, \"own it, don't trade it\" view on Apple, though. On top of all the earnings, the Federal Reserve will announce its latest interest rate decision on Wednesday afternoon. The central bank is widely expected to leave rates unchanged, according to the CME Group's FedWatch tool. Plus, Cramer said there's a possibility that President Donald Trump announces Fed Chair Jerome Powell's replacement Wednesday, which he believes could move the market more than the rate news itself.",

    "body": "Rio Tinto and Glencore are back in talks about a possible $260 billion megadealRio TintoGlencore's London-listed shares popped 8% on Friday morning, after it was confirmed a possible $260 billion takeover bid from Rio Tinto was back on the table.Shares were last seen just over 8% higher. Meanwhile, London-listed shares of Rio Tinto fell 1.6% at the open, after its Australian shares ended Friday's session 6.3% lower. Stock Chart IconStock chart iconGlencore share price\"Rio Tinto and Glencore have been engaging in preliminary discussions about a possible combination of some or all of their businesses, which could include an all-share merger between Rio Tinto and Glencore,\" Rio Tinto, the larger of the two companies, said in a statement early Friday morning. \"The parties' current expectation is that any merger transaction would be effected through the acquisition of Glencore by Rio Tinto by way of a Court-sanctioned scheme of arrangement.\"If completed, the deal would create the world's largest mining company. European mining shares rose in early trade on Friday, with the Stoxx Europe Basic Resources index adding around 0.5%. Copper mining firm Antofagasta jumped 3%, while Anglo American was up 2.3%.CNBC has approached both companies for further comment. Rio Tinto said it had until 5 p.m. London time (12 p.m. ET) on Feb. 5 to either announce a firm intention to make an offer for Glencore or announce that it does not intend to make an offer. Rio Tinto and Glencore discussed a merger in late 2024, but talks collapsed over issues such as valuation and the future of Glencore's coal mines.Back in August, Rio Tinto CEO Simon Trott announced a reorganization of the business. Trott promised to cut costs and unlock up to $10 billion from its asset base by making the company focus on three core product groups — iron ore, aluminium and lithium and copper.A deal between Rio Tinto and Glencore would add to recent M&A activity in the mining sector, after Anglo American and Canada's Teck Resources agreed to merge in a $66 billion deal last September. The merger is expected to create one of the world's top five copper producers.Renewed talks between Glencore and Rio Tinto have also been by rising demand for copper, with prices of the red metal hitting an all-time high of $13,000 a ton this week.",

    "body": "The U.S. government is considering investing in a company's critical minerals mining projects in Greenland, its CEO has told CNBC, ahead of high-stakes talks between Washington and Danish officials over the island's future.The projects are run by mining company Amaroq, which operates in South Greenland and is involved in extracting or exploring gold, copper, germanium and gallium, among other critical mineral deposits.Discussions with U.S. government bodies about the potential investment opportunities are ongoing and haven't been finalized, Amaroq CEO Eldur Ólafsson told CNBC in an interview.Deals could involve \"offtake agreements, infrastructure support and credit lines,\" Ólafsson added, though he declined to comment on what specific projects the U.S. government was interested in.When asked to comment, a U.S. State Department spokesperson, mentioning Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry, told CNBC: \"The United States is eager to build lasting commercial relationships that benefit Americans and the people of Greenland.\"President Trump reiterated the importance of Greenland to U.S. defense and underscored his commitment to the relationship by designating Governor Landry as Special Envoy to Greenland.\"CNBC approached the Export-Import Bank of the United States, or EXIM, for comment but had not received a response as this article went live.Ólafsson's comments come as U.S. President Donald Trump ramps up talk of acquiring Greenland, which he sees as integral to national security, following a dramatic military operation to seize Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro on Saturday.European nations have been scrambling to respond to escalating rhetoric about Greenland from the U.S., which has refused to rule out military action.U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio is to meet with officials from Denmark next week to discuss Greenland, a self-governing Danish territory.watch nowGreenland's critical mineralsThe White House sees Greenland's deposits as a potential way to break China's dominance in the critical minerals.Rare-earth companies with projects in the Arctic island surged earlier this week on U.S. comments about acquiring the territory.Trump has mainly emphasized national security when discussing Greenland in recent days, but former national security advisor Mike Waltz told Fox News in January 2025 that U.S. interest in the island was about \"critical minerals.\"Some experts have cautioned that extracting critical minerals from Greenland isn't economically viable due to the harsh conditions and lack of infrastructure, but Ólafsson told CNBC that it was realistic with proper planning and logistics.He compared the process to significant critical minerals mines in Russia and Alaska, which, he said, were built in similar conditions.He said that \"one of the biggest challenges in any mining project is usually some [transporting minerals] long distances on land,\" but added that many of Greenland's mineral deposits were near \"deep fjords,\" meaning they could be easier to ship. Climate change has transformed some parts of Greenland, with ice melting to reveal wetlands, areas of shrub and barren rock. This has made some of the island's strategic minerals more accessible for mining firms.",

    "body": "President Donald Trump speaks during the House Republican Party member retreat at the Kennedy Center in Washington, Jan. 6, 2026.Mandel Ngan | AFP | Getty ImagesPresident Donald Trump's renewed focus on housing affordability has found a clear villain: institutional investors that own large swaths of single-family homes in fast-growing Sun Belt cities, where would-be homeowners increasingly find themselves bidding against Wall Street.Trump argued in a social media post Wednesday that corporate ownership has helped push housing further out of reach for everyday Americans, saying he's immediately taking steps to ban large institutional investors from buying more single-family homes. The message may be aimed at places like Atlanta and Jacksonville, metropolitan areas where investor ownership is far higher than the national average. While institutional investors only own roughly 2% of the nation's single-family rental housing stock, their presence is far more concentrated in parts of the Southeast. The U.S. Government Accountability Office estimates, for example, that investors control about a quarter of Atlanta's single-family rental market, more than a fifth of Jacksonville's and sizable shares in Charlotte and Tampa.Wall Street goes shopping in the Sun BeltThose concentrations trace back to the aftermath of the financial crisis, when large investors moved aggressively into housing markets flooded with foreclosures. By buying homes in bulk, they helped stabilize prices in hard-hit regions experiencing sharp declines, particularly across the Sun Belt, according to Wolfe Research. \"While their overall footprint is limited, ownership is heavily concentrated in Sun Belt cities, likely reflecting expectations of stronger home price appreciation,\" analysts at Wolfe said in a recent note to clients.The idea of curbing Wall Street's role in housing isn't new. Analysts at BTIG note that Congress has seen multiple efforts in recent years to rein in institutional homeownership, ranging from tighter regulations and financing limits to outright ownership bans and even forced liquidations. \"Bureaucratic limitations have historically hindered the legislation in Congress, and as it stands now most bills remain in the 'Introduced' phase,\" BTIG said in a note. Trump did not provide details on how such a ban would be implemented. The president said he plans to outline additional housing and affordability proposals in a speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos in two weeks.— CNBC's Michael Bloom contributed reporting.",

    "body": "A cargo ship sits in New York Harbor on Nov. 19, 2025 in New York City. Spencer Plat | Getty ImagesThe U.S. Supreme Court on Friday could rule on the legality of President Donald Trump's tariffs, a decision poised to have far-reaching impacts on not only trade policy, but also the U.S. fiscal situation.Though it's not certain that the high court will make its ruling, it has scheduled Friday as a \"decision day\" for handing down opinions, and there is widespread speculation that the tariff case will come up.At its core, the ruling will address two issues: whether the administration can use provisions under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to levy the tariffs, and if it isn't proper, if the U.S. will have to reimburse those importers who already have paid the duties.However, the final decision could also fall somewhere in between.The court has the option to grant limited powers under the IEEPA and require only limited repayment, along with multiple other options for how it handles a touchy matter that is being closely watched on Wall Street.Moreover, even should the White House lose the case, it has other tools in its chest to implement tariffs that don't require the emergency powers cited under the act.Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent himself said Thursday he expects a \"mishmash\" ruling.\"What is not in doubt is our ability to continue collecting tariffs at roughly the same level, in terms of overall revenues,\" Bessent said during an appearance in Minneapolis. \"What is in doubt, and it's a real shame for the American people, was the president loses flexibility to use tariffs both for national security, for negotiating leverage.\"Trump used the IEEPA in part as an emergency measure to stop the inflow of fentanyl to the U.S. The impact of losingLosing the tariffs would have multiple ramifications, said Jose Torres, senior economist at Interactive Brokers.\"If the court blocks the tariffs, the administration is going to find workarounds,\" Torres said. \"President Trump is very ambitious in getting this agenda through despite potential controversies that could surround such a decision.\"\"Blocking tariffs would be bad for onshoring ambitions. It would be bad for fiscal conditions, rates would go higher,\" he added. \"But it would be good for corporate earnings. Input prices would be lower and trade would be smoother.\"Administration officials have cited a number of options to offset the court's decision should it not go their way. Prediction markets site Kalshi is pointing to just a 28% probability that the court will rule in favor of the tariffs as implemented. Torres said his firm's clients have a similar expectation. Bessent has said that the administration has at least three other options through the 1962 Trade Act that will keep most of the tariffs in place. However, he also has worried that reimbursements could place a strain on the administration and its effort to drive down the fiscal deficit. Tariffs brought in some $195 billion in fiscal 2025 and another $62 billion in 2026, according to Treasury data.Ultimately, Morgan Stanley analysts \"see significant room for nuance\" in the Supreme Court decision. The court \"has wide latitude when it comes to issuing decisions, a range of outcomes is possible, like the Court narrowing the scope of existing tariffs but not mandating their full removal or limiting the future application of tariffs,\" Morgan Stanley analysts Ariana Salvatore and Bradley Tian said in a note.\"We do think there's scope for the administration to take a lighter-touch approach to the overall tariff regime given a recent political focus on affordability,\" they added.The tariff impact thus far has defied analyst projections: There's been a limited impact on inflation, while the trade deficit has plunged, countering expectations in some quarters that the tariffs could make the U.S. a pariah on the global trading stage. The trade imbalance for October hit its lowest level since the end of the financial crisis in 2009, at a time when imports had declined sharply due to the massive recession the crisis generated.",

    "body": "watch nowElon Musk's lawsuit against OpenAI will proceed to trial, further escalating his yearslong feud with the company and its CEO, Sam Altman. \"We appreciate the Court's thorough and fair consideration and look forward to trial,\" Musk's lead counsel, Marc Toberoff, told CNBC's David Faber Thursday in a statement following a hearing with U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers.Musk and Altman co-founded OpenAI as a nonprofit research company alongside several other researchers and executives in 2015. Musk departed from OpenAI's board in 2018 after trying to convince Altman to let his autos business, Tesla, acquire the AI nonprofit.In the lawsuit, Musk alleged he agreed to start the company because he was promised that it would \"chart a safer, more open course than profit-driven tech giants,\" according to a complaint.\"The hearing confirms what we've maintained from the outset — there is substantial evidence that OpenAI's leadership made knowingly false assurances to Mr. Musk about its charitable mission that they never honored in favor of their personal self-enrichment,\" Toberoff said.OpenAI has repeatedly denied the claims, and lawyers for the company have filed a motion to dismiss the case.The Tesla CEO alleges in the suit that he was \"assiduously manipulated\" and \"deceived\" after OpenAI established an \"opaque web of for-profit OpenAI affiliates,\" including its multibillion-dollar partnership with Microsoft, and explored converting to a for-profit entity, the filing states. He claimed Altman and the other defendants have been \"unjustly enriched to the tune of billions of dollars in value.\"Read more CNBC tech newsMeta faces China probe over acquisition of AI agent startup ManusMicrosoft revealed as company behind controversial data center proposal in Michigan townshipAlphabet's market cap surpasses Apple's for first time since 2019Google, Character.AI to settle suits involving minor suicides and AI chatbotsA spokesperson for OpenAI said Thursday that Musk's lawsuit \"continues to be baseless and a part of his ongoing pattern of harassment.\"\"We remain focused on empowering the OpenAI Foundation, which is already one of the best resourced nonprofits ever,\" the spokesperson said. Gonzalez Rogers said Wednesday that the case would head to trial, according to the Associated Press. The judge said she still needed to determine some of the logistics as to how that trial will be set up.Microsoft is also named as a defendant in the lawsuit, as Musk alleges the company aided and abetted OpenAI's breach of fiduciary duty. A representative for Microsoft did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment.The lawsuit was filed in August 2024 in the U.S. District Court in the Northern District of California. Elon Musk attends the U.S.-Saudi Investment Forum in Washington, Nov. 19, 2025.Evelyn Hockstein | ReutersIn 2024, OpenAI announced plans to convert into a for-profit company, which would have wrested control from the nonprofit and kept it as a separate arm. After facing pressure from civic leaders and ex-employees, OpenAI said its nonprofit would retain control.The startup announced it completed its recapitalization in October, cementing its structure as a nonprofit with a controlling stake in its for-profit business. As part of that recapitalization, Microsoft holds an investment in OpenAI's for-profit arm valued at around $135 billion. Musk has long warned about the potential dangers of artificial intelligence and the risks it could pose for humanity, and launched his own AI company called xAI in 2023. He competes directly with OpenAI, Google, Anthropic and other AI players. XAI started as a for-profit, \"benefit corporation\" with an obligation to deliver environmental and social benefits through its work. The company dropped that obligation and its benefit corporation status in 2025 when Musk merged xAI with his social network X.Musk has come under fire in recent weeks after the company's chatbot and image generator, Grok, allowed users to easily create and share what's known as \"deepfake porn,\" or nonconsensual intimate images of real-life women, and AI-generated images depicting child sexual abuse. X and xAI are facing regulatory probes over the images by the European Commission, India, Malaysia and Australia.— CNBC's Lora Kolodny contributed to this reportWATCH: Musk, Altman rivalry escalates with new OpenAI hirewatch now",

The White House and the Federal Housing Finance Agency, which oversees Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, did not immediately respond to CNBC's requests for clarity.watch nowFHFA Director Bill Pulte posted on X later Thursday, \"We are on it. Thanks to President Trump, Fannie and Freddie will be executing.\" Hours before Trump's post, Pulte said in a CNBC interview that he expects Trump will make a decision in the next month or two on a possible initial public offering of Fannie and Freddie.Trump claimed that his latest directive would help restore \"affordability,\" a word that has become key to Democrats' political messaging as they accuse the Republican president of failing to address high prices.Trump heaped criticism on the administration of his predecessor, Joe Biden, claiming that Biden had \"ignored the Housing Market\" amid a slew of other policy failures.\"Everything was broken, but I, as President of the United States, have already fixed it!\" Trump declared. \"Now, I am giving special attention to the Housing Market.\"\"Because I chose not to sell Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in my First Term, a truly great decision, and against the advice of the 'experts,' it is now worth many times that amount — AN ABSOLUTE FORTUNE — and has $200 BILLION DOLLARS IN CASH,\" he wrote.\"Because of this, I am instructing my Representatives to BUY $200 BILLION DOLLARS IN MORTGAGE BONDS.\"It was not clear from Trump's post whether it would be Fannie and Freddie, the Treasury Department or another entity doing the buying.The Federal Reserve in the past has purchased mortgage bonds in an effort to lower rates, as part of the monetary policy known as \"quantitative easing.\" But the executive branch cannot order the independent central bank to initiate those transactions.The Treasury has purchased mortgage bonds in the past during times of extreme turmoil, such as the housing crisis of 2008 and 2009.It was also not clear whether this buying would have any impact on mortgage rates. The Fed's quantitative easing typically involves buying multiple types of securities, with larger amounts done in Treasuries in order to lower long-term Treasury rates.Mortgage rates typically follow the lead of long-term Treasury rates, rather than mortgage bond yields.The 10-year Treasury yield ticked slightly lower after hours amid Trump's comments.",

The crew launched from NASA Kennedy Space Center on a SpaceX Dragon spacecraft and Falcon 9 rocket on August 1, 2025. The agency said that it would not disclose the crew member's name or specific condition due to medical privacy. NASA Chief Medical Officer, James D. Polk, said at a press conference on Thursday the astronaut's condition is considered stable however, and the medical situation did not arise from any \"injury in pursuit of operations.\"Polk also said, there is \"a very robust suite of medical hardware on board the International Space Station,\" but it doesn't include all the tools physicians would have in a hospital emergency department to complete a full patient workup. The astronaut's \"medical incident was was sufficient enough,\" he said, that NASA decided to bring Crew-11 back early due to \"lingering risk.\"The Crew-11 astronauts' return was planned for around March 2026. The decision to bring the astronauts back early due to a medical situation represents a first for NASA.The last early contingency return by the agency involved its STS-83 Space Shuttle mission in 1997, when one of Columbia's fuel cells failed in orbit. This mission landed safely.Read more CNBC tech newsMeta faces China probe over acquisition of AI agent startup ManusMicrosoft revealed as company behind controversial data center proposal in Michigan townshipAlphabet's market cap surpasses Apple's for first time since 2019Google, Character.AI to settle suits involving minor suicides and AI chatbotswatch now",

    "body": "watch nowIntel shares rose 2% in extended trading on Thursday after President Donald Trump posted a flattering message on social media about the chipmaker and its CEO, and championed the government's investment in the company.\"I just finished a great meeting with the very successful Intel CEO, Lip-Bu Tan,\" Trump wrote on Truth Social.In August, the U.S. government took a 10% stake in Intel through an $8.9 billion investment. That came  from CHIPS Act grants that hadn't been paid and government awards for semiconductor manufacturing.\"The United States Government is proud to be a Shareholder of Intel, and has already made, through its U.S.A. ownership position, Tens of Billions of Dollars for the American People — IN JUST FOUR MONTHS,\" Trump wrote. \"We made a GREAT Deal, and so did Intel. Our Country is determined to bring leading edge Chip Manufacturing back to America, and that is exactly what is happening!!!\"Intel shares have soared 75% since the Trump administration's announced investment, lifting the government's stake to over $18 billion. The U.S. is now Intel's biggest shareholder.Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan holds a wafer of CPU tiles for the Intel Core Ultra series 3, code-named Panther Lake, outside the Intel Ocotillo campus in Chandler, Arizona. Panther Lake is the first client system-on-chips (SoCs) built on the Intel 18A process node.Courtesy: IntelTan replaced Pat Gelsinger as Intel's CEO in March, after the company had lost market share to Advanced Micro Devices and Nvidia, as well as producers of chips based on energy-efficient Arm designs. But Intel remains a key supplier of processors for PCs and computer servers. In July, the chipmaker said it would lay off thousands of employees, and Tan moved to pull back on chip production in the U.S. and in Europe. A plant in Ohio is set to come online in 2030 or 2031.The next month, Trump called on Tan to resign, saying the CEO was \"conflicted.\" The remarks came after U.S. Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., questioned Tan's ties to China. Tan, who was born in Malaysia and raised in Singapore, invested in more than 600 Chinese technology companies, Reuters reported in April.Days later, Trump changed his tune and praised Tan's \"amazing story\" after meeting with the Intel CEO. The investment came later that month. Earlier this week, at the CES trade show in Las Vegas, Intel announced the availability of 2-nanometer 18A PC chips. Intel said the process was the most advanced ever manufactured in the U.S. \"Intel just launched the first SUB 2 NANOMETER CPU PROCESSOR designed, built, and packaged right here in the U.S.A.,\" Trump said in Thursday's post.Intel has committed tens of billions of dollars toward creating a domestic chip fabrication business, though, like AMD and Nvidia, it also relies on Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company.WATCH: CNBC's interview with Melius Research's Ben Reitzes",

    "body": "The U.S. Capitol in Washington, Dec. 8, 2025. Graeme Sloan | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesThe first vetoes of President Donald Trump's second term survived separate override votes by the House of Representatives on Thursday.The outcome was a surprise, since both bills that Trump had vetoed were passed in unanimous voice votes by the House and Senate. The bills supported infrastructure in Colorado and Florida.The override vote on the Colorado bill veto failed 248-177, with one member voting present. The Florida override measure failed 236-188.Overriding a veto requires a two-thirds majority in both the House and Senate. By rule, if a vote to override a veto fails in the House, no vote is required in the Senate, and the veto remains in effect.The votes came hours after Trump was rebuked by a vote in the Senate, which advanced a bill to curtail his ability to use the U.S. military in Venezuela. Trump's veto of the Colorado bill infuriated some Republican lawmakers from the state, including the bill's sponsor, Rep. Lauren Boebert, who until the latter half of 2025 had been a close Trump ally. The bill, the Finish the Arkansas Valley Conduit Act, sought to reduce the payments local communities must make for the construction of a pipeline set to provide clean drinking water to rural communities in Colorado.  \"Time after time in that chamber, I am disappointed to see the lack of leadership,\" Boebert told reporters after the override vote.\"This had nothing to do with policy … folks are afraid of getting a mean tweet or attacked,\" she said.Rep. Lauren Boebert, R-Colo., arrives to the U.S. Capitol for the last vote of the week on Friday, November 15, 2024.Tom Williams | Cq-roll Call, Inc. | Getty ImagesAnother co-sponsor of the bill, Rep. Jeff Hurd, R-Colo., before the vote had said that overriding Trump's veto would reassert the authority of Congress.Trump's veto \"should give every member pause,\" Hurd said. \"My constituents are watching, and your constituents are watching.\"In a message to Congress, Trump said he vetoed the Colorado bill because it would \"continue the failed policies of the past by forcing Federal taxpayers to bear even more of the massive costs of a local water project — a local water project that, as initially conceived, was supposed to be paid for by the localities using it.\"Read more CNBC politics coverage‘Greenland belongs to its people’: European leaders unite over Trump’s threats to annex territoryTrump wants to take over Greenland — but the island's economy faces 'major challenges'Hilton shares fall after DHS says MN hotel canceled reservation due to immigration enforcementRepublican Rep.

The bill also would have required the Interior Department to help flood-proof structures in the area. Trump said he vetoed the bill in part to prevent \"American taxpayers from funding projects for special interests, especially those that are unaligned with my Administration's policy of removing violent criminal illegal aliens from the country.\"Trump was accused of vetoing both bills for political reasons.The Miccosukee Tribe was one of the groups that sued the Trump administration over its construction of \"Alligator Alcatraz,\" a detention center set up to house migrants.The facility has since been shut down.Boebert was one of the few Republicans who bucked Trump and joined Democrats in the successful effort to compel the Department of Justice to release files related to the notorious sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Boebert resisted intense pressure from the White House to back down from that effort.Trump has also vowed retribution against Colorado for its refusal to release Tina Peters, a former county clerk who last year was convicted of crimes related to tampering with voting machines.Rep. Randy Fine, a Republican from Florida, in an interview on Wednesday night, said, \"I support the president, so I'm not going to vote to override him.\"— CNBC's Justin Papp contributed to this report.",

    "body": "HAIKOU, CHINA - JANUARY 01: Customers shop at CDF Haikou International Duty Free City on January 1, 2026 in Haikou, Hainan Province of China. Luo Yunfei | China News Service | Getty ImagesChina's consumer inflation accelerated in December to the fastest pace in nearly three years as spending picked up ahead of the New Year holiday, while factory-gate deflation remained entrenched, signaling that underlying demand stayed weak. Consumer prices rose 0.8% from a year earlier, their highest level since February 2023, according to data from the National Bureau of Statistics on Friday. The improvement followed a 0.7% climb in November and matched the economists' expectations in a Reuters poll. The rebound in consumer prices was largely driven by fresh vegetables, which rose 18.2% from a year earlier due to supply shortages during the cold winter. Among other food items, pork prices fell 14.6%. Core inflation, which excludes volatile prices of food and energy, was up 1.2% year on year in December, unchanged from the growth in the prior month. On a monthly basis, consumer prices grew 0.2%, above the expected 0.1% gain in a Reuters poll. Still, for 2025 as a whole, the inflation gauge was flat, missing the official target of \"around 2%,\" signaling that Beijing's stimulus measures implemented so far, including a consumer goods trade-in program, have done little to boost demand.Producer prices dipped 1.9% in December from a year earlier, better than the forecast 2% decline, extending the deflationary streak beyond three years. The drop moderated from a 2.2% fall in November, partly due to higher prices for non-ferrous metal materials.Prices for durable consumer goods dropped 3.5% from a year earlier. Lijuan Dong, chief NBS statistician, said that gold jewelry prices surged 68.5% year on year in December, driven by a global rush into the precious metal amid recession fears and market uncertainty.  Longest deflationary streakWhile China is on track to achieve its growth target of about 5% last year, the economy has continued to face deflationary pressure. Consumers have remained reluctant to spend amid an uncertain employment outlook and a prolonged property crisis that has eroded household wealth.  Larry Hu, chief China economist at Macquarie, expects China's annual consumer inflation to remain flat in 2025, while producer price deflation is forecast at 2.7%, which would mark the longest deflationary streak on record. China's real GDP growth will likely soften to 4.5% in the fourth quarter, down from 4.8% in the third quarter, said a team of economists at Bank of America Global Research. The Wall Street bank said the contraction in fixed-asset investment likely deepened in December, dropping around 11.8% from a year earlier, compared with an 11.1% decline in November. Industrial production growth is estimated to have edged up to around 4.9%, supported by a pickup in manufacturing activity and the \"usual year-end acceleration in output.\" China's manufacturing activity unexpectedly expanded in December, snapping a record eight straight months of decline. The official purchasing managers' index (PMI) rose to 50.1 from 49.2 in the prior month, above the 50-point threshold separating growth from contraction.     At a key economic policy-setting meeting in early December, the ruling Communist Party leadership reiterated plans to boost consumption and stabilize the property market, although similar pledges in the past have failed to deliver meaningful results.  Property crisis persistsA recent article published by the Communist Party's flagship magazine Qiushi Journal called for the \"implementation of a stronger, comprehensive package of measures to stabilize the real estate sector, rather than through piecemeal-style approach.\"     The government may roll out more easing measures in the near term, including cutting mortgage rates and easing home purchase restrictions, said Macquarie's Hu. However, these measures may not be \"forceful enough to reverse the trend,\" Hu warned, estimating new home sales in floor space to fall by 7% in 2026 after an 8% decline in 2025.watch nowChinese policymakers have also stepped up efforts to curb intense price wars that have hurt businesses' profitability and ordered a production cut in some sectors to rein in oversupply. Still, industrial firms saw their profits drop 13.1% year-on-year in November, their steepest drop in over a year.   Carmakers in the country have rolled out a new round of price cuts and perks at the start of this year as demands remained sluggish and the government withdrew part of a tax incentive for eligible electric vehicles. Factory-gate prices in the automaking industry dropped 2.8% in 2025. In December, prices for gasoline-powered and new energy vehicles fell 2.4% and 2.2% from a year earlier, respectively, according to official data. \n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tWeekly analysis and insights from Asia's largest economy in your inbox\n\t\t\tSubscribe now\n\t\t\n\t",

This week, the White House said Trump was considering various options to make it happen, including military action.Greenland, the world's largest island, is rich in untapped mineral resources. Although geographically positioned on the North American continent, it is politically part of Europe.Acquiring the island would be no mean feat. Aside from political obstacles both at home and abroad, any attempt to take the territory by force would pit the U.S. against its NATO allies.Would NATO fight the U.S. over Greenland? In an interview with CNN earlier this week, top Trump aide Stephen Miller suggested no European country would be prepared to put up a fight to protect Greenland. Although not explicitly ruling out the possibility of U.S. military action in Greenland, he argued that \"there's no need to even think or talk about this in the context of a military operation [because] nobody's going to fight the United States militarily over the future of Greenland,\" pointing to the island's small population.For its part, Denmark and Greenland are taking of U.S. military action seriously. In a statement on Tuesday evening, Danish Defense Minister and Deputy Prime Minister Troels Lund Poulsen said Denmark would spend 88 billion Danish kroner ($13.8 billion) rearming Greenland, given \"the serious security situation we find ourselves in.\"Despite that apparent willingness from Denmark to defend Greenland, analysts told CNBC they do not believe European forces would ever open fire on American troops. Read moreEdward R. Arnold, a senior research fellow at British defense think tank Royal United Services Institute, told CNBC in a call on Tuesday that the White House does have the military power to move in on Greenland and, if it wanted to, could do so \"really quite quickly.\"But Washington would not have to launch an operation like the one seen in Venezuela over the weekend, according to Arnold, because \"it would be completely unopposed.\"\"What European military commander is going to open force on a U.S. troop transport coming into Greenland?\" he said. \"That would start an inter-NATO war, potentially. And the U.S. knows that.\"The United States has, by far, the greatest military strength of any NATO member. In 2024, NATO estimated that the U.S. had 1.3 million military personnel, compared to the rest of the alliance's collective 2.1 million personnel. The next biggest military staff belonged to Turkey, which had an estimated 481,000 people working in its forces.Arnold said he expects that the U.S. will gradually increase the number of troops it has stationed in Greenland, rather than ordering a full-blown military operation or invasion. \"They just wouldn't fire on them,\" he said of NATO forces. \"So you just have this weird position whereby the U.S. are just putting those troops into Greenland and the Europeans can't really do much about [it], but protest politically.\"A protester holds a sign reading 'We are not for sale' in front of the US consulate during a demonstration, under the slogan 'Greenland belongs to the Greenlandic people', in Nuuk, Greenland, on March 15, 2025. Christian Klindt Soelbeck | Afp | Getty ImagesGeorgios Samaras, assistant professor of public policy at King's College London, agreed that Greenland and the wider NATO alliance would have limited options to stop a move from the U.S. to seize more control of the island. \"I don't see what NATO could do to stop the U.S. — for starters, because we're talking about a superpower having so many military bases across the continent, which could be used theoretically to invade a member of NATO from within its own ranks,\" he told CNBC on a call. Not only would NATO have to contend with turning against one of its own members, it would have to consider the broader security implications of splitting from the U.S., according to Jamie Shea, an associate fellow in Chatham House's International Security Program and a former member of NATO's international staff.\"I would not see a military response [from NATO] as the U.S. would be able to deal quickly with whatever limited forces the Europeans would be able to send, and it is highly unlikely that European governments would consider doing this,\" he told CNBC. \"They need all their forces for the defense of Europe and to contribute to a European reassurance force for Ukraine.\"The end of NATO? On Monday, Denmark's Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen warned an American takeover of Greenland would spell the end of NATO. Of NATO's 32 members, 23 – including Denmark – are also members of the European Union, which has been working extensively to ensure Trump's administration continues its support for Ukraine. \"They would want to avoid a direct clash with the U.S. which would spell the end of NATO and of U.S. support for Ukraine,\" Shea said. King's College's Samaras agreed that any escalation toward Greenland would destroy NATO. \"If a NATO member threatens another member of the alliance, it doesn't just cause a row. It makes the alliance's mutual defense promise look conditional and political,\" he said. \"It would mean the end of NATO. I don't think that NATO could continue.\" watch nowShea told CNBC that although European military resistance is unlikely, NATO, through the European Union, does have ways of exerting pressure on Washington. \"Where Europe could exercise leverage on the U.S. is in the economic field if the EU adopts sanctions such as tariffs or limiting access for U.S. companies and investments,\" Shea said. \"European governments could also deny the U.S. use of European military bases or facilities like early warning radars. But these would obviously be difficult decisions for European governments to make, particularly at a time when they have been working so hard to engage Washington on a Ukraine peace plan and security guarantees.\"Trump: U.S. 'will always be there for NATO' Despite his ambition to acquire Greenland, driving a wedge between the U.S. and its NATO allies, Trump insisted on Wednesday that America stands by the alliance – even as he lashed out at the organization. \"Remember, for all of those big NATO fans, they were at 2% GDP, and most weren't paying their bills, UNTIL I CAME ALONG,\" he said in a Truth Social post, referring to member states' defense spending targets. Trump then suggested the alliance would be unable to ward off modern security threats without the U.S. among its ranks. \"RUSSIA AND CHINA HAVE ZERO FEAR OF NATO WITHOUT THE UNITED STATES, AND I DOUBT NATO WOULD BE THERE FOR US IF WE REALLY NEEDED THEM,\" he said. \"We will always be there for NATO, even if they won't be there for us.\"",

The perceived probability of missing a minimum debt payment in the months ahead rose to 15.3%, the highest level since April 2020. The increase was most pronounced among individuals over the age of 60, those without a college degree and those with annual household incomes below $50,000, the New York Fed's survey found. Across all age and education levels, job loss expectations also worsened.\"If you're not sure about your own job security, it makes it hard to focus on any other financial goals,\" said Matt Schulz, chief consumer finance analyst at LendingTree.watch nowDelinquency rates increased across the board in December, the most recent U.S. Household Credit Report from Moody's Analytics also found. Delinquencies may continue to rise in the months ahead, the report said, \"as increased joblessness strains household budgets.\"According to a separate report by the Conference Board, consumers' views of their current financial situation in December \"collapsed\" into negative territory for the first time since July 2022, the month after pandemic-era inflation had peaked. The Conference Board's expectations index, which is based on consumers' short-term economic outlook, held steady at 70.7 — well below the 80 level considered a signal for a recession ahead.Meanwhile, consumers are tapping additional liquidity even as they worry about falling into the red. Credit card balances keep edging higher, according to recent reports by TransUnion and VantageScore.The K-shaped economyIn an increasingly bifurcated consumer economy, credit card debt widens the divide, according to Ted Rossman, senior industry analyst at Bankrate.Roughly 175 million consumers have credit cards. While some pay off the balance every month, about 60% of credit card users have revolving debt, according to the New York Fed.In the so-called K-shaped economy, some borrowers are struggling to keep up while others have strengthened their financial position, largely by benefiting from stock market gains and appreciating home values. \"The K-shaped economy is an important part of the context,\" Rossman said in an email. \"With stocks and home prices at record levels, that's benefiting the ~65% of Americans who own homes and the ~60% who own stocks, but not everyone is sharing in that.\" Subscribe to CNBC on YouTube.",

    "body": "watch nowMonths after President Donald Trump suggested sending Americans a $2,000 tariff dividend check, many households are waiting to see if that stimulus could come in 2026, despite political and legal obstacles. \"We have taken in, and will soon be receiving, more than 600 Billion Dollars in Tariffs,\" Trump wrote in a Truth Social post on Monday.The president first floated the idea of making direct payments to Americans in the form of a \"tariff dividend\" in July. Later in the fall, Trump suggested in Oval Office comments and on social media that a rebate check funded with tariff revenue would be likely. \"A dividend of at least $2000 a person (not including high income people!) will be paid to everyone,\" he wrote in a post on Truth Social in November. In an interview on CBS' \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" last month, National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett said, \"I would expect that in the new year, the president will bring forth a proposal to Congress to make that happen.\"Asked about tariff rebates this week, a White House official told CNBC that \"President Trump's tariffs are raising historic revenue for the federal government, and the Administration is committed to putting that money to good use for the American people.\"The math behind tariff rebate checksStill, the president's $600 billion tally far exceeds other estimates. The Bipartisan Policy Center said that U.S. gross tariff revenue in 2025 was $289 billion. According to the Customs and Border Protection agency, the U.S. collected roughly $200 billion in customs duties in 2025. \"Let's be clear: President Trump's claim that the U.S. government collected $600 billion from tariffs in 2025 is incorrect,\" said Brett House, economics professor at Columbia Business School. \"The White House may decide to issue so-called tariff dividend checks in 2026, but they won't be fully financed by U.S. tariffs, and they won't be dividends since Americans paid these tariffs in the first place,\" House said. \"It's not a dividend when you give money back to people that they paid earlier.\"Read more CNBC personal finance coverageConsumer outlook improves despite job worries, New York Fed survey findsIRS will start accepting tax returns Jan. 26 for the 2026 tax seasonWhere Trump's $2,000 tariff dividend checks stand nowAfter a record-breaking holiday shopping season comes a wave of returningWhat Medicaid changes in Trump's 'big beautiful bill' mean for family caregiversOlder workers could use 401(k) money to buy annuities, under bipartisan billWho could see bigger tax refunds in 2026 from Trump's cutsACA subsidy cliff may mean 'astronomical tax bills' for many, CFP says2026 tax brackets could mean a slightly bigger paycheck — what to expectWhy estate planning helps 'forestall bad outcomes': 'My Mother's Money' authorSome ETFs compete on price, but fees shouldn't always be biggest concern: analystStudent loan forgiveness is taxable again: Plan for the 'tax bomb,' CFP saysUSPS changes may delay postmarks.

The increase in prices was expected to cost each household $1,700, on average, in 2025. The idea of a stimulus check comes at a time when many Americans are feeling particularly strained. Consumers' views of their current financial situation in December \"collapsed\" into negative territory for the first time since July 2022, the month after pandemic-era inflation had peaked, according to a report by the Conference Board.However, a one-time $2,000 per-person tariff rebate for those making less than $100,000 per year would cost $450 billion, the Yale Budget Lab estimated. That's about twice as much as the total revenue that will be raised by the administration's tariff hikes in 2026, according to the Yale findings.First, a 'warrior dividend'Trump also announced last month that the government would send a $1,776 \"warrior dividend\" check to each U.S. service member. Those checks were funded through the Defense Department. Tariff dividend checks, on the other hand, would require congressional approval.\"A potential tariff dividend would be significantly more difficult to implement than the warrior dividend,\" said certified financial planner Stephen Kates, a financial analyst at Bankrate. \"The warrior dividend was funded through military housing allocations included in the One Big Beautiful Bill. That funding had already been appropriated to the military and was later repurposed to issue checks.\"In the interview on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" last month, Hassett said tariff rebates will \"depend on what happens with Congress.\"Last July, Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., introduced the American Worker Rebate Act of 2025, which proposed a rebate check funded with tariff revenue. The Senate referred that bill to the Committee on Finance, where it remains.\"Similar to the stimulus checks issued during and after the Covid pandemic, any broad-based benefit program would require legislation passed by Congress,\" Kates also said. \"No such legislation currently exists.\"Further, Trump's tariffs still face legal obstacles that could erase surplus tariff revenue. If the Supreme Court rules that Trump's new tariffs are unlawful under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, the court could then say that companies that have paid the duties so far are entitled to refunds. A ruling could be issued as soon as Friday.Subscribe to CNBC on YouTube.",

Mathieu Lewis-Rolland | Getty ImagesA U.S. Border Patrol agent shot and wounded a man and a woman in a vehicle on Thursday afternoon in  Portland, Oregon, after the driver allegedly tried to run over agents, a senior federal official said.The shooting occurred a day after a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent fatally shot Renee Nicole Good as she was driving toward him on a street in Minneapolis, Minnesota, after being ordered to exit her SUV by other ICE agents.McLaughlin and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem have accused Good, 37, of engaging in \"domestic terrorism,\" and claimed that she intentionally tried to run over ICE agents after blocking a residential street with her vehicle.Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and other Democratic officials have said those claims are false, pointing to videos of the shooting.The shooting in Portland occurred at 2:19 p.m. PT, as Border Patrol agents were \"conducting a targeted vehicle stop,\" Homeland Security Department Deputy Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a post on X.\"The passenger of the vehicle and target is a Venezuelan illegal alien affiliated with the transnational Tren de Aragua prostitution ring and involved in a recent shooting in Portland,\" McLaughlin said.\"The vehicle driver is believed to be a member of the vicious Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua,\" she said.\"When agents identified themselves to the vehicle occupants, the driver weaponized his vehicle and attempted to run over the law enforcement agents,\" McLaughlin said. \"Fearing for his life and safety, an agent fired defensive shots,\" she said. \"The driver drove off with the passenger, fleeing the scene.\"Portland Police said the unidentified man and the woman who were shot were taken to a hospital, and that their conditions were unknown. The FBI is leading the investigation of the shooting.Portland Mayor Keith Wilson, whose city has become a focus point for immigration enforcement actions by the Trump administration, in a statement, said, \"Just one day after the horrific violence in Minnesota at the hands of federal agents, our community here in Portland is now grappling with another deeply troubling incident.\"\"We cannot sit by while constitutional protections erode and bloodshed mounts,\" Wilson said.\"Portland is not a 'training ground' for militarized agents, and the 'full force' threatened by the administration has deadly consequences,\" he said. \"As Mayor, I call on ICE to end all operations in Portland until a full investigation can be completed.\"Portland Police Chief Bob Day, in a statement, said, \"We are still in the early stages of this incident.\"\"We understand the heightened emotion and tension many  are feeling in the wake of the shooting in Minneapolis, but I am asking  the community to remain calm as we work to learn more,\" Day said.Portland Police, in a statement, said they responded to a report of a shooting on Southeast Main Street, in the city's Hazelwood neighborhood.\"Officers confirmed that federal agents had been involved in a shooting,\" the statement said. \"Portland Police were not involved in the incident.\"\"At  2:24 p.m., officers received information that a man who had been shot was calling and requesting help in the area of Northeast 146th Avenue and East Burnside,\" police said. \"Officers responded and found a male and female with apparent gunshot wounds,\" the statement said.\"Officers applied a tourniquet and  summoned emergency medical personnel. The patients were transported to the hospital. Their conditions are unknown.\"\"Officers have determined the two people were injured in the shooting involving federal agents,\" police said.The FBI's Portland office, in an emailed statement to CNBC, said it was \"investigating an assault on a federal officers that happened at approximately 2:15pm near the 10000 block of Main St. in Portland involving two Customs and Border Patrol agents.\"\"The two assailants fled the scene immediately following the shooting and are currently being treated for their injuries,\" the office said. \"This remains an active and ongoing investigation led by the FBI.\"",

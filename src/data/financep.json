    "body": "A growing number of workers are primed to leave their jobs if their companies require them to return to office, a new report found.According to FlexJobs' 2025 State of the Workforce Report, 76% of American workers said they would look for a new job if they were no longer allowed to work remotely, based on a survey of 3,000 professionals in the U.S.That's a nearly 20% increase from last year's report, in which 57% of workers said that they would \"absolutely\" look for another job if they couldn't continue to work remotely.And of those looking for jobs, 85% said remote work is the number one factor motivating them to apply for a job, even above salary and benefits and work-life balance.It's unsurprising that remote work has remained popular among American professionals, according to FlexJobs career expert Toni Frana: It offers benefits like \"greater work-life balance, more flexibility and even cost savings,\" she says.Citing the survey, Frana points out that only 2% of surveyed workers prefer working in office full-time, as opposed to fully remote or hybrid.Companies continue to push RTO mandates in an effort to \"strengthen collaboration\" among employees and improve visibility, Frana says, but many workers aren't having it: 27% of employees say that they know someone who has quit or is planning to quit due to return-to-office requirements.Navigating an RTO pushIf your company is pursuing a return-to-office plan, Frana suggests opening a constructive conversation with your manager about what RTO would mean for your role:\"What challenges are we trying to address by returning to the office? How will success be measured? Is there any amount of flexibility that would still be offered?\"Another option could be putting together a proposal for why you should be allowed to continue working remotely, Frana says.\"I think the main thing to bring to a conversation like this is your results: any feedback that you have from clients or other co-workers, and any goals that you've met or exceeded,\" she says.The goal is to demonstrate to your manager that \"you've been productive, efficient and a stellar employee\" despite not working in-person, she says.If remote work is non-negotiable for you, it may be time to look for a new job \"that better meets your needs,\" Frana says.Plenty of companies offer fully remote work, Frana says, but competition can be fierce for those roles. She advises job seekers to polish up their resumes, reach out to their network and do their research on remote-friendly workplaces.For workers committed to staying remote, it's crucial \"to be proactive in looking for the type of work environment and position that they want in the future,\" she says.Want to earn more and grow your money? Save 30% with this earnings-boosting bundle of our top courses.Plus, sign up for CNBC Make It's newsletter to get tips and tricks for success at work, with money and in life, and request to join our exclusive community on LinkedIn to connect with experts and peers.",

    "body": "UNITED STATES - NOVEMBER 10: Jeremy Siegel, the Russell E. Palmer Professor of Finance at the Wharton School, addresses the Securities Industry Association during their annual meeting in Boca Raton, Florida, Thursday, November 10, 2005. Matt Stroshane | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesChina's control over crucial rare earth materials has been a \"threat for a long time\" to Western supply chains and the U.S. should create a strategic reserve of the metals, University of Pennsylvania professor emeritus of finance Jeremy Siegel told CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" Monday.\"It's scandalous that we don't have a rare earth strategic reserve [and] that we let China monopolize 90% of refining rare earth materials,\" Siegel said. \"Where were we, realizing the importance of these?\"Siegel's strategic reserve proposal comes as the U.S.-China trade war intensified Friday, with President Donald Trump vowing to impose \"massive tariffs\" on Beijing in response to its limits on rare earth mineral exports to the U.S., and threatening to cancel a planned meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping. Trump's announcement erased $2 trillion in value from the stock market.The U.S. created the Strategic Petroleum Reserve in 1975 in response to the 1973 Arab Oil Embargo. Today, almost three quarters of the world's rare earth minerals, used in everything from smartphones to fighter jets, are mined in China, which processes 90% of the metals, according to Bank of America analysts.\"Export controls could create a choke point in global supply chains,\" BofA global economist Claudio Irigoyen wrote Sunday in a note to clients.But Siegel said he's confident the U.S. and China will resolve their latest trade conflict before Trump's Nov. 1 deadline for more tariffs.   \"It'll be worked out, and it won't be too negative for either country,\" Siegel said. Trump's remarks were \"just a prelude to saying, 'All right there are our chips, we've got cards [and] you've got cards...and let's negotiate.'\"Siegel, author of 1994's Stocks for the Long Run, said the November 1 deadline is actually a sign that Trump hopes to negotiate with his Chinese counterpart. \"Trump said 100% [tariffs] but he said, 'Listen, I said the November 1 date, which for me is like forever,'\" Siegel said. \"It's actually the farthest date he's ever set for the start of a tariff, which means he wants to have that solved.\" Siegel added that the market will likely snap back following trade talks between Washington D.C. and Beijing. The S&P 500 is about 1.2% higher in early trading Monday after crumbling 2.7% on Friday.\"Once it's resolved, given all the other good things that are happening, I see no reason why we can't continue on to new highs,\" Siegel said.The S&P 500 is regaining some 40% of its Friday losses early Monday, while the Nasdaq Composite has climbed about 2% as technology stocks rebound from last week's retreat.

    "body": "A top loader moves a container at the Fenix Marine Services terminal at the Port of Los Angeles in Los Angeles, California, US, on Friday, Aug. 15, 2025. Bloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesWith less than 24 hours ahead of new U.S. government port fees on Chinese-made freight vessels, importers are grappling with additional tariffs that include other Chinese-made machinery key to the supply chain.On Friday, the U.S. Trade Representative announced modifications following a review of public comments on the prior rule, which include an additional 150% tariffs on rubber tire gantry cranes, rail-mounted gantry cranes, automatic stacking cranes, reachstackers, straddle carriers, terminal tractors, top loaders, and the components that make up the pieces of equipment.Factoring in the layering of prior tariffs on the cranes, the new tariff rate can be as high as 270%.In addition to the port crane fees, additional changes include the fee structure changes for vehicle carriers, otherwise known as roll-on roll-off vessels, which help to carry automobiles, farm equipment and other heavy machinery.Now, a fee will be charged based on the vessel's net tonnage capacity instead of the number of vehicles being carried. One ocean carrier that owns and operates RoRos said the change could cost them millions.That will be on top of the new USTR port fees, set to go into effect on Tuesday. The USTR, under the Biden administration, investigated China's maritime practices in both shipbuilding and crane manufacturing; the Trump Administration pursued the trade actions. According to trade experts, payments on these new tariffs can be deferred until December 10 but the fees will begin applying on October 14.In an email to CNBC, a spokesperson for the American Association of Port Authorities wrote the seaport industry is challenged by yet more taxes on the equipment necessary for supply chain expansion and resilience.\"Ports large and small struggle to finance large, modern, world-class equipment like cranes when government policies double the price overnight. The choice is literally between affordable equipment or lagging behind,\" the spokesperson said. \"The industry has always worked with the government to try to shift the sourcing domestically or to allied countries - the industry has always been in favor of a supply-side manufacturing incentive for that purpose - and we expect Congress will eventually pass it on a bipartisan basis with support from the Trump Administration. Until then, we're going to see a dearth of readily available and affordable equipment. I hope and trust these challenges to global supply chains and mutually beneficial trade can get worked out by the negotiators soon.\"Lars Jensen, founder of Vespucci Maritime, told CNBC the fees on cranes and port equipment are merely another element added to the costs of the U.S. supply chain.\"Effectively, the tariffs are another headwind and making imports more expensive and exports less competitive,\" said Jensen. \"In recent months, we have seen how containerized volumes to and from the U.S. are declining while volume in the rest of the world is increasing strongly. Every new headwind will serve to solidify that development.\"Thomas Kazakos, secretary general of the International Chamber of Shipping, which represents the world's national shipowner associations and over 80% of the world's merchant fleet, told CNBC they are still reviewing the modifications.\"ICS supports the ambition to increase U.S. shipbuilding capacity and to make the United States Shipbuilding industry strong, as additional commercial tonnage strengthens the global maritime sector's efficiency and competitiveness, said Kazakos. \"However, the service or port fees proposed by the USTR will have a huge impact on US exports. It could damage US export competitiveness and raise costs for US businesses and consumers, as the proposed port fees are essentially a protectionist measure.\"In a global maritime study conducted by ICS and Professor Craig VanGrasstek from the Harvard Kennedy School of Government, researched suggested that a lower level of trade restrictive measures affecting maritime transport could increase some economies' GDP by up to 3.4%.      \"Removing tariff and non-tariff barriers are quick and easy tools available to policymakers to increase levels of GDP,\" Kazakos said. \"Countries at all levels of economic development would be better off if even modest reductions were made to the existing barriers.   As we are seeing, these measures also often inspire retaliatory measures. Ultimately, no one will win if these tactics are pursued.\"China recently announced counter tariff measures. U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said there have been \"substantial communications\" with China over past weekend on trade, adding that President Trump is still expected to meet Chinese President Xi Jinping in South Korea later in the month.For the U.S. energy market, the modifications are good news; USTR eliminated a clause for suspension of licensing of LNG shipments. The provision in the April announcement mandated that increasing proportions of US LNG exports must be moved on U.S.-built vessels.Other vessels in the U.S. Maritime Security Program that transport military use vehicles and built in non-U.S. yards will continue to benefit from a \"targeted exemption\" through 2029.Carl Bentzel, CEO of the National Association of Waterfront Employers, told CNBC that the trade association is \"disheartened, but not surprised based on discussions with the White House, that USTR did not grant the 3-year waiver we requested they requested.\" Bentzel said they are still evaluating the 150% penalty on the tariffs impacting the very wide range of additional argo handling equipment. \"That seemingly came out of nowhere,\" said Bentzel.\"It is clear now that the hammer has been dropped on Chinese cargo handling equipment, and this will make it more important than ever to get government support to develop a U.S.-based cargo handling technology,\" he said.",

The missiles reportedly cost an average of $1.3 million each.Trump was traveling in the Middle East on Monday.He first visited Israel and then flew to Egypt as talks on a peace deal for Gaza are being finalized.",

    "body": "A close-up view of the Nexperia plant sign in Newport, Wales on April 1, 2022. Matthew Horwood | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesThe Dutch government has taken control of Nexperia, a Chinese-owned semiconductor maker based in the Netherlands, in an extraordinary move to ensure a sufficient supply of its chips remains available in Europe amid rising global trade tensions.Nexperia, a subsidiary of China's Wingtech Technology, specializes in the high-volume production of chips used in automotive, consumer electronics and other industries, making it vital for maintaining Europe's technological supply chains. On Sunday evening, the Dutch Minister of Economic Affairs revealed that it had invoked the \"Goods Availability Act\" on the company in September in order \"to prevent a situation in which the goods produced by Nexperia (finished and semi-finished products) would become unavailable in an emergency.\"Following the announcement from The Hague, Wingtech plunged its maximum daily limit of 10% on the Shanghai Stock Exchange.The Goods Availability Act allows The Hague to intervene in private companies to ensure the availability of critical goods in preparation for emergency situations, and its use comes amid escalation in the U.S.-China trade war.The government statement said the \"highly exceptional\" move had been made after the ministry had observed \"recent and acute signals of serious governance shortcomings and actions\" within Nexperia.\"These signals posed a threat to the continuity and safeguarding on Dutch and European soil of crucial technological knowledge and capabilities. Losing these capabilities could pose a risk to Dutch and European economic security,\" it said, identifying the automotive industry as particularly vulnerable.Governance changesIn a corporate filing dated Oct.13, lodged with the Shanghai Stock Exchange, Wingtech confirmed Nexperia was under temporary external management and had been asked to suspend changes to the company's assets, business or personnel for up to a year, according to a Google translation.Wingtech Chairman Zhang Xuezheng had been immediately suspended from his roles as executive director of Nexperia Holdings and nonexecutive director of Nexperia after the ministerial order, according to the filing.The filing added that Nexperia's daily operations will continue, with the impact of the measures not yet quantifiable.\"The Dutch government's decision to freeze Nexperia's global operations under the pretext of 'national security' constitutes excessive intervention driven by geopolitical bias, rather than a fact-based risk assessment,\" Wingtech said in a deleted WeChat post, which was archived and translated by Chinese policy blog Pekingnology.It added that since it acquired Nexperia in 2019, Wingtech \"has strictly abided by the laws and regulations of all jurisdictions where it operates, maintaining transparent operations and sound governance,\" and employs \"thousands of local staff\" through research and development and manufacturing sites in the Netherlands, Germany and Britain.A spokesperson from Nexperia told CNBC that the company had no further comments, but that it \"complies with all existing laws and regulations, export controls and sanctions regimes,\" and remained in regular contact with relevant authorities.The Netherlands' move comes after Beijing tightened its restrictions on the export of rare earth elements and magnets Thursday, which could impact Europe's automotive industry. The move could also further strain trade relations between China and the Netherlands, following years of restrictions on Dutch company ASML's exports of advanced semiconductor manufacturing equipment to China.In 2023, the Netherlands had also investigated Nexperia's proposed acquisition of chip firm startup Nowi, though the deal was later approved.",

    "body": "People depart a Lego store in Manhattan on August 29, 2024 in New York City. Spencer Platt | Getty ImagesIn July 2023, just two months after his mother fought and won a battle against breast cancer, Sam Lane began to get sick.Sam underwent several rounds of testing, and the now 14-year-old finally received a diagnosis: a rare brain and spine cancer.\"They said 'cancer,' and before I started crying, I said, 'Dang it, I was going to guess that, but I didn't want it to be that bad,'\" Sam said.But at his lowest point, on a feeding tube and unable to walk, a nurse offered Sam a bright spot: She said she needed his help to build a Lego MRI scanner set for fellow patients at Boston Children's Hospital to play with and learn from.Sam's mom said she was \"blown away\" by the level of detail in the play set, made of specialized Lego bricks.\"I remember sitting there saying to him, 'Sammy, why don't you take a break? You've been working at that straight for some time,'\" Christina Lane said. \"And he just didn't even look at me and was like, 'Nope, this is important... I need to help other kids.'\"Lego's MRI scanner sets, which feature a scanner, patient bed, waiting room, staff figures and medical instruments, were designed specifically to help children learn about the procedure through hands-on play. The miniature MRI machine table moves back and forth, mimicking a real procedure.On Monday, the toy company announced that more than 1 million children globally have used the sets to help them prepare for their medical procedures. New Lego research found that 96% of healthcare professionals said the model helps to reduce children's anxiety, and 46% reported a lesser need to use sedation after the children played with the set.Lego MRI Scanner play setCourtesy: LegoMRIs, which don't involve radiation, are often used in pediatric care – but with the bright light, loud noises and requirement to stay still, the machines often frighten children and introduce the need for sedation, according to Sam's child life specialists, Laura Boegler and Alyssa Sachs.They focus on ways to support psychosocial and emotional wellbeing of patients and families at Boston Children's Hospital and said opportunities to play are key.\"We often say that play is a universal language, and so the play-based approach of being able to touch and ask questions really helps ease anxieties and misconceptions that any kids have,\" Sachs said.Boegler said having children play with the Lego set before their own MRI scans has significantly helped decrease anxiety and increase familiarity with the procedure.The set that Sam built is being used to ease other patients' worries in a way that feels authentic to them.\"An MRI machine, that's not something that kids are seeing in school, that's not what they're talking about at home, so it's kind of like this new scary thing,\" Boegler said. \"Using the MRI Lego set, we're able to show kids in a way that's comfortable for them.\"Lego doesn't sell the sets and instead has donated more than 10,000 of the kits to hospitals around the world.Over the past few years, Lego has worked on expanding its customer base and deepened its strategy to achieve a streak of positive annual growth. The company has begun to cater more to adults as well as kids with more sophisticated and bespoke kits, including a wide range of sets aligned with pop culture like \"Harry Potter\" to \"Wicked.\"The company's botanical and F1 racing sets, in particular, have brought new customers into the fold.Icons Tiny Plants by Lego.James Manning - Pa Images | Pa Images | Getty ImagesChristina Lane said the MRI play set her son built helped him feel connected to other children battling cancer.\"To have a little Lego buddy that they can identify with that is going through the same things that they are is really incredible,\" she said. \"As a mom, as a nurse, as a human being, to be able to support our kids during such a challenging and difficult time through play – truly, it's essential.\"And the set has even helped Sam in his own journey. Now celebrating over a year cancer-free, he reflected on how his relationship with the machines has changed.In his first MRI, Sam said he felt claustrophobic and scared, and the noises felt too loud for him to comprehend.But now, he has a simple and reliable strategy for all of his MRI sessions: \"I fall asleep.\"Correction: This story has been updated to correct details of Sam Lane's cancer diagnosis and treatment.

    "body": "A Xiaomi electric car SU7 in a store in Yichang, Hubei Province, China on July 19, 2025.Cfoto | Future Publishing | Getty ImagesChinese tech giant Xiaomi saw its shares fall over 5% on Monday, following reports that the doors of one of its electric vehicles failed to open after a fiery crash in China that left one person dead.The stock slid as much as 8.7% in Hong Kong, marking its steepest drop since April, before paring losses after images and video of a burning Xiaomi SU7 sedan in Chengdu circulated on Chinese social media.Video and eyewitness accounts showed bystanders trying but failing to open the doors of the burning car to rescue an occupant. Personnel at the scene eventually used a fire extinguisher to put out the blaze, local reports said.Chengdu police said the crash occurred after the SU7 collided with another sedan, killing a 31-year-old male driver who was suspected of driving under the influence of alcohol.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconXiaomi sharesXiaomi, which manufactures consumer electronics, software and electric vehicles, did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment.The latest incident follows a fatal SU7 crash earlier this year that raised questions about the vehicle's smart driving features and sent Xiaomi's shares tumbling.The crash could also intensify scrutiny on electronic door handles, a design popularized by Tesla and now common in modern EVs. Unlike mechanical models, electronic door handles rely on sensors and electricity and may fail during a fire or power outage.China is considering a ban on such electric door handles to address safety risks linked to the feature, state-backed media reported in late September.Meanwhile, the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has launched an investigation into about 174,000 Tesla Model Y vehicles after reports of door handle failures.",

    "body": "U.S. President Donald Trump shakes hands with Argentina's President Javier Milei during the 80th United Nations General Assembly, in New York City, New York, U.S., Sept. 23, 2025.Alexander Drago | ReutersThe Treasury Department has extended a financial lifeline to Argentina in apparent hopes of heading off an emerging market financial crisis that could spread to U.S. shores.In a move that Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent announced Thursday on social media site X, the U.S. is providing a $20 billion currency swap line with Argentina's central bank — essentially exchanging stable U.S. dollars with volatile pesos.The move comes amid liquidity concerns in Argentina that threatened stability for the country as it faces key midterm elections.Providing the swap line \"marks a pivotal moment for Argentina's financial stability,\" Diego Celedon, head of equity strategy for the region at JPMorgan Chase, said in a client note. \"The U.S. support acts as a circuit breaker, halting the negative feedback loop that had threatened to deepen Argentina's economic strain.\"Economics, markets and politicsThere are equal parts economic and political stakes with the venture, which marks the first U.S. intervention of this nature since rescuing Mexico in 1995.While Argentina poses little systemic risk, it can still matter in terms of possible capital flight along with volatility in debt and commodity markets. That chance was deemed worth the risk of potential Argentinian default.\"Overall, the American intervention has transformed Argentina's short-term outlook, but the administration must now leverage its political capital to fully capitalize on this window of opportunity,\" Celedon wrote.The immediate market reaction was for the peso to appreciate sharply against the dollar Friday.However, an exchange-traded fund pegged to the country's industrial leaders, the Global X MSCI Argentina ETF, slumped Friday, indicating concerns that the American backstop may not be enough.\"It's unclear why the Trump administration is providing a de facto bailout of the Argentinian peso when there is no significant financial or economic relationship between the two economies,\" said Joseph Brusuelas, chief economist at RSM.\"It's entirely unclear to me that Argentina will not choose to devalue its peso after its election later this month,\" he added. \"Therein lies one of the greater risks of providing $20 billion Treasury supported swap line to Buenos Aires.\"In addition to economic and market matters, the U.S. has a significant political stake in what's happening in Argentina.Oct. 26 elections will determine the fate of President Javier Milei's government, which has become an important ally for the U.S. in the region. With investors jittery over global growth and election-year uncertainty, the bailout shows Washington is committed to keeping credit markets calm at home.Defending the dealIn his announcement of the deal, Bessent said it was in response to \"a moment of acute illiquidity\" and said the U.S. was in a unique position to help.He further mentioned the country's efforts at fiscal reform that \"will generate significant dollar-denominated exports and foreign exchange reserves.\"Still, the country's shaky fiscal history generated caution that the U.S. essentially could be throwing good money after bad as Argentina has a long history of defaulting on its debts.\"Milei has succeeded in sharply reducing inflation but has struggled to stabilize the peso's exchange rate against the dollar,\" said Lourdes Casanova, director of the Emerging Markets Institute at Cornell University. \"Given that currency trading is the largest financial market in the world ... no amount of reserves can single-handedly offset that pressure.\"The move also was met with criticism elsewhere, ranging from the soundness of the Argentinian political and economic system to the White House's use of the Exchange Stabilization Fund for the liquidity measure.\"While the government is 'shut down,' the Treasury Department officially started its bailout of Argentina,\" Rohit Chopra, director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, said in a statement. \"We are now actively pumping dollars into Argentina in exchange for the country's plummeting peso, rather than helping people here at home.\"Bessent, though, said Milei's fiscal policies are \"sound\" and the success of the country is systemically important.Correction: This story has been updated to correct the name of the Exchange Stabilization Fund.",

    "body": "watch nowVeteran investor Howard Marks isn't calling the artificial intelligence boom a bubble — at least not for now.\"My response to date has been that the valuations are ... high but not crazy\" the Oaktree Capital Management co-founder said Monday in an interview with CNBC's Sara Eisen. \"Expensive and going down tomorrow are not synonymous.\"Marks, known for his memos on market cycles and investor psychology, said while enthusiasm for AI stocks is undeniable, it hasn't yet crossed into the realm of mania that defines a true bubble.\"To me, the main ingredient in bubbles is psychological excess ... some kind of temporary mania,\" he said. \"For a company in this sector or industry, there's no such thing as a price too high. And I don't detect that level of mania at this time, so I have not put the bubble label on this incident ... it just hasn't reached that critical mass of mania.\"(You can view the full interview with Marks here on CNBC PRO.)Investors have piled into AI-linked names this year, driving valuations of chipmakers and software companies to historic highs amid fears of missing out. Marks believes that investor optimism doesn't automatically signal irrational exuberance.Marks drew a parallel to the late 1990s internet boom, which promised to transform the world — and ultimately did — yet left a trail of worthless companies in its wake.\"Back in '99, people said the internet will change the world. And it certainly did,\" he said. \"But the vast majority of the companies that went public for the internet and e-commerce in '98, '99, early 2000 ended up worthless.\"He warned that the same psychological patterns often reappear in bubbles. Investors assume the current leaders will remain dominant, that even the laggards will prosper, and that any company with a small chance of massive success is worth backing.\"A company with a 2% chance of going up 100x is still a winner. And I think that's a reach too far,\" Marks said. \"That's bubble psychology.\"For now, he doesn't see the AI rally fitting that mold.\"I think people are counting on AI for a lot,\" he said. \"I think that it's probably going to deliver a lot. We have no idea what it's going to deliver, when, or in what form. And I've made the judgment that it's not manic behavior.\"",

    "body": "watch nowShares of Bloom Energy soared Monday after striking a deal with Brookfield Asset Management to install fuel cells in artificial intelligence data centers.Brookfield will spend up to $5 billion to deploy Bloom Energy's technology, the first investment in its strategy to support big AI data centers with power and computing infrastructure. Bloom's fuel cells are \"fuel-flexible\" and can run on natural gas, biogas or hydrogen, the company says.Brookfield and Bloom are collaborating to design and build what they are calling \"AI factories\" around the the world, including a site in Europe that will be unveiled before the end of the year.Shares of Bloom Energy jumped more than 20%. Bloom's fuel cells provide on-site power that can be quickly installed because they don't rely on a connection to the electric grid.Bloom has already positioned hundreds of megawatts of fuel cells through deals with utilities including American Electric Power and data center developers such as Equinix and Oracle, according to the company.The AI industry's data center plans are growing in scale. Nvidia and OpenAI, for example, recently announced a partnership that aims to build 10 gigawatts of data centers, equivalent to the power consumed by New York City at the height of summer.But AI companies' plans are butting up against an aging U.S. electric grid that is often slow to provide additional power capacity. Data centers also threaten to raise electricity prices for residential customers.Deploying power solutions \"behind-the-meter,\" or off the grid, \"are essential to closing the grid gap for AI factories,\" said Brookfield's global head of AI infrastructure, Sikander Rashid, in a release announcing the deal.\"AI infrastructure must be built like a factory—with purpose, speed, and scale,\" Bloom Energy CEO KR Sridhar said in the release.Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang told CNBC last week that the artificial intelligence industry will need to build power off the electric grid to quickly meet demand and protect consumers from rising electricity prices.\"Data center self-generated power could move a lot faster than putting it on the grid and we have to do that,\" Huang said.",

    "body": "watch nowJPMorgan Chase on Monday said it is launching a decade-long plan to help finance and take direct stakes in companies it considers crucial to U.S. interests.The bank said in a statement it would invest up to $10 billion into companies in four areas: defense and aerospace, \"frontier\" technologies including artificial intelligence and quantum computing, energy technology including batteries, and supply chain and advanced manufacturing.The money is part of a broader effort, dubbed the Security and Resiliency Initiative, in which JPMorgan said it will finance or facilitate $1.5 trillion in funding for companies it identifies as crucial. It said the total amount is 50% more than a previous plan.\"It has become painfully clear that the United States has allowed itself to become too reliant on unreliable sources of critical minerals, products and manufacturing — all of which are essential for our national security,\" JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon said in the release.As the biggest American bank by assets and a Wall Street juggernaut, JPMorgan was already raising funds and lending money to companies in those industries. But the move helps organize the company's activities around national interests at a time of heightened tensions between the U.S. and China.On Friday, markets tumbled as President Donald Trump announced new tariffs on Chinese imports after the major U.S. trading partner tightened export controls on rare earths.In the release, Dimon said the U.S. needs to \"remove obstacles\" including excessive regulations, \"bureaucratic delay\" and \"partisan gridlock.\"JPMorgan said that within the four major areas, there were 27 specific industries it would look to support with advice, financing and investments. That includes areas as diverse as nanomaterials, autonomous robots, spacecraft and space launches, and nuclear and solar power.\"Our security is predicated on the strength and resiliency of America's economy,\" Dimon said. The project \"includes efforts like ensuring reliable access to life-saving medicines and critical minerals, defending our nation, building energy systems to meet AI-driven demand and advancing technologies like semiconductors and data centers.\"The bank said it would hire an unspecified numbers of bankers and create an external advisory council to support its initiative.In a call with reporters, Dimon said that the project was an internal effort that started a few months ago, not something done with the Trump administration. Dimon also said that even while pumping up their financing efforts by 50% over a decade, he didn't expect \"lower-than-commercial returns\" on the initiative.\"Obviously, we work closely with people in the government, which we've always done, but this is a JPMorgan effort,\" Dimon said.

    "body": "Oracle CEO, Clay Magouyrk, sits down with CNBC’s David Faber on Oct. 13, 2025. CNBCOracle CEO Clay Magouyrk, one of the two people tapped last month to lead the software company, is confident that OpenAI will be able to cover the costs of the massive amount of cloud infrastructure services it consumes.In an interview with CNBC's David Faber at Oracle's AI World conference on Monday, Magouyrk said \"of course\" OpenAI can pay $60 billion for a year's worth of cloud resources. In July, OpenAI agreed to a five-year deal with Oracle that's worth more than $300 billion.\"Just look at the rate at which they've grown to, you know, almost a billion users. That's just unheard of,\" said Magouyrk, who sat alongside fellow Oracle CEO Mike Sicilia for the interview in Las Vegas.OpenAI said last week that its flagship ChatGPT chatbot, which was publicly launched less than three years ago, now has 800 million weekly active users. In 2024, OpenAI recorded a $5 billion net loss.Sicilia said Oracle has started integrating OpenAI artificial intelligence models into a patient portal for viewing electronic health records. Oracle acquired EHR vendor Cerner for about $28 billion in 2022.\"I've seen the results, and I really do think that they're going to have a dramatic impact on industries, on enterprises of all types,\" Sicilia said of OpenAI.OpenAI rents out Nvidia graphics chips to run models through Oracle, as well as CoreWeave, Google and Microsoft. At the same time, the company is designing a custom AI processor that Broadcom will build. Earlier on Monday, Broadcom and OpenAI said they will jointly deploy 10 gigawatts worth of the new OpenAI chips.Building out that much infrastructure requires a hefty amount of new energy.\"I think it's a factor of time, not a factor of if we'll have enough power,\" Sicilia said.Oracle shares rose 5% on Monday. The stock has gained 84% this year, lifting Oracle's market cap close to $900 billion.WATCH: Oracle CEO Magouyrk: ‘Of course’ OpenAI can pay $60 billion per yearwatch now",

    "body": "A salesperson (left) shows vehicles to a shopper at a Toyota dealership.Getty ImagesDETROIT — Look no further than the automotive industry for the latest indication that U.S. consumers could be facing a \"K-shaped\" economy, where the wealthy keep seeing gains while those who have lower incomes struggle.The average price paid for a new vehicle last month topped $50,000 for the first time ever, Cox Automotive's Kelley Blue Book reported Monday. Meanwhile, auto loan delinquency rates remain near all-time highs for those with low credit ratings.Consumers who can afford a new vehicle are on a buying spree, while those on tighter budgets are staying out of the market, according to Cox Automotive executive analyst Erin Keating.\"While there are many affordable options out there, many price-conscious buyers are choosing to stay on the sidelines or cruising in the used-vehicle market,\" she said in a statement. \"Today's auto market is being driven by wealthier households who have access to capital, good loan rates and are propping up the higher end of the market.\"Economists have warned the U.S. economy is increasingly \"K-shaped\" following the coronavirus pandemic, with consumers experiencing different realities depending on their income level.Wealthier Americans have been assisted by rising house values, lucrative stock market returns and favorable credit, while lower- and middle-income buyers have faced tighter budgets and been hit hard by rising inflation.watch now\"We have already, for a while now, talked about the 'K-shaped' outlook for the consumer. Some consumers are doing well. Some are doing less well,\" Apollo Global Management chief economist Torsten Slok said Monday on CNBC's \"Squawk on the Street.\" \"Now we also having a K-shape for the broader economy, where you have a booming industrial renaissance, but the consumer is facing more headwinds.\"Slok was addressing the overall U.S. market for consumers amid a potential trade war with China, but also said affordability concerns and the increasing rate of auto loan delinquencies by subprime buyers are a problem.New car buyers have faced rising sticker prices, smaller discounts and higher loan rates since the coronavirus pandemic — especially for those with the worst credit scores.The average new auto loan rate was about 9% as of the most recent data from August, according to Cox Automotive's Dealertrack. That included rates of around 18% to 20% for subprime or \"deep-subprime\" consumers, who have lower credit scores and are more likely to default on a loan.Last month's pricing record of $50,080 comes as auto loan delinquencies, defaults and repossessions have increased in recent months and years, particularly for consumers with subprime credit — or those with a FICO score below 620.watch nowFitch Ratings reports 6.43% of subprime auto loans in August were at least 60 days past due, in line with a record high of 6.45% that was hit in January. Delinquency rates for borrowers with higher scores have remained relatively stable.The Consumer Federation of America, a nonprofit advocacy group, last month described U.S. auto financing at a \"breaking point, as Americans owe over $1.66 trillion in auto debt.\"The report was released as the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau received record high numbers of complaints about auto loans. It followed an analysis by the New York Fed last year that found car buyers with above-average credit scores (620-679) were twice as likely to fall behind as they were before the pandemic.Cars.com's Edmunds earlier this month reported the share of buyers committing to monthly payments of $1,000 or more accounted for 19.1% of all financed new-car transactions in the third quarter, near the record set the previous quarter at 19.3%.Rising delinquency rates among other concerns, recently led to subprime auto lender Tricolor unexpectedly collapsing.Cox's Keating noted that while tariffs have increased costs and reduced affordability, the record prices last month were driven by the strong sales of all-electric vehicles. Consumers rushed to buy EVs ahead of federal tax incentives of up to $7,500 ending at the end of September.EVs are typically more expensive than their traditional counterparts, with Cox Automotive reporting the average transaction price for a new EV last month was more than $58,000.\"We've been expecting to break through the $50,000 barrier,\" Keating said. \"That's today's market, and it is ripe for disruption.\"",

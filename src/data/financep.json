    "body": "U.S. President Donald Trump gestures during an announcement from the State Dining Room at the White House in Washington, D.C., U.S., Oct. 23, 2025.Jonathan Ernst | ReutersPresident Donald Trump on Friday exempted key agricultural imports like coffee, cocoa, bananas and certain beef products from his higher tariff rates.The move comes as Trump faces political blowback for high prices at U.S. grocery stores. Some distributors of beef, coffee, chocolate and other common food items have raised prices as Trump's tariffs took hold this year, adding to pressure on household budgets created by decades-high inflation in recent years.Trump's action Friday also exempts a range of fruits including tomatoes, avocados, coconuts, oranges and pineapples. Along with coffee, the tariff reductions extend to black and green tea, and spices like cinnamon and nutmeg.The move marks a reversal for Trump, who has insisted tariffs are necessary to protect U.S. businesses and workers. He has contended U.S. consumers will not ultimately pay for the higher duties.The exemptions come just a day after Trump reached trade framework agreements with four Latin American countries – including 10% tariffs on most goods from Argentina, Guatemala, and El Salvador, and 15% from Ecuador. It also removes duties specifically on products not grown or produced in the U.S. in sufficient quantities, like bananas and coffee.Rising food prices have hampered U.S. households for several years. Consumer Price Index data show food-at-home prices increased approximately 2.7% year-over-year in September. (More recent data was delayed because of the government shutdown).The tariff exemptions aim to help moderate these grocery price increases, although experts caution that other factors such as global supply shortages also influence prices, especially for coffee and beef.Here's more background on how industries like beef, coffee and cocoa have reacted to tariffs and rising prices.BeefA customer shops for meat at a Costco store on Nov. 11, 2025 in Novato, California. Justin Sullivan | Getty ImagesThe tariff exemption for beef comes after months of rising prices tied in part to Trump's own tariff policy.Over the past year, the U.S. imposed steep duties on major suppliers including Brazil, Australia, New Zealand and Uruguay. Brazil – the world's second-largest beef producer – has faced effective tariff rates topping 75%, driving down imports into the U.S. just as the cattle herd in the country hit a near 75-year low.Ranchers have struggled to rebuild herds amid drought, higher feed costs and tariffs on fertilizer, steel and aluminum that have made equipment and repairs more expensive.The supply squeeze has fueled a spike in prices at the grocery store: uncooked beef products rose 12% to 18% year over year in September, according to the most recent consumer price index report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.Producers told CNBC earlier this month that policy whiplash, from changing tariff rates to the recent expansion of Argentina's beef quota, has further chilled long-term investment, keeping supplies tight and sentiment fragile.CoffeeCoffee beans are displayed at a grocery store on Nov. 13, 2025 in San Anselmo, California.Justin Sullivan | Getty ImagesGround roast coffee prices in the U.S. reached $8.41 per pound in July, a record high and a 33% increase from the prior year, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data.Trump's 50% tariff on Brazilian coffee –  which supplies roughly a third of U.S. imports – drove up costs across the roasting and retail supply chains. Vietnam, Colombia and other major exporters have also been swept up in the administration's food tariffs.Roasters and cafés say they have no way around the duties because the U.S. produces none of the beans it consumes, leaving importers exposed to higher costs regardless of origin. The September CPI report found that coffee prices climbed nearly 21% in August from the prior year. That was the largest jump since the 1990s.Retailers have warned the impact could have spread if tariffs stayed in place. The Tax Foundation estimated in August that 74% of U.S. food imports faced tariffs, already hitting tea, spices and other products that, like coffee, have no domestic supply chain.Many of those products that have little or no U.S. production were on the list of items Trump exempted from higher tariffs Friday.Global coffee prices are hovering near a 50-year high reached in February.CocoaCocoa has faced similar price pressures.Even after a sharp selloff this fall, futures are still more than double pre-pandemic levels, costing roughly $5,300 today, following tariffs and three years of weather-driven crop failures in the Ivory Coast and Ghana.In October, Hershey executives said they expected $160 million to $170 million in tariff expenses this year, on top of record-high bean costs that pushed retail chocolate prices nearly 30% higher from the prior year heading into Halloween, according to research firm Circana.",

Nasa | Getty ImagesA former Air Force intelligence officer has pleaded guilty to lying to a federal agent by falsely claiming that her estranged astronaut wife illegally accessed her bank account while aboard the International Space Station for six months, prosecutors in Houston, Texas, said Friday.The guilty plea by Summer Worden, 50, on Thursday comes more than five years after she was indicted in the space case for lying about actions by her wife, Anne McClain, a U.S. Army colonel, West Point graduate and Iraq war combat veteran, while they were in the midst of a divorce.The claim came at a time when Worden said that the couple was engaged in a custody battle over what Worden's then-6-year-old son, who had been conceived through in vitro fertilization and carried by a surrogate.Worden's trial in the case was scheduled to begin next Monday in Houston federal court.The Kansas resident was accused of making false statements about McClain to NASA's Office of Inspector General and the Federal Trade Commission, where she alleged that McCain had committed identity theft.Worden in July \"alleged her estranged spouse had guessed the password and illegally accessed her bank account while the spouse was deployed to the International Space Station,\" the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Texas said in a statement headlined \"Far Out\" on Friday.Read more CNBC politics coverageU.S. and Switzerland reach trade deal to lower tariffs to 15%Goldman Sachs stands by top lawyer after her emails with Jeffrey Epstein exposedGovernment shutdown back pay headed to federal workers in coming daysJeffrey Epstein files: House speaker announces vote next week on release of docsSupreme Court to hear arguments on Trump bid to fire Fed Gov.

    "body": "PATNA, INDIA - OCTOBER 31: Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar along with BJP national president J.P. Nadda, HAM party founder Jitanram Manjhi, RLM president Upendra Kushwaha and others releasing NDA manifesto (Sankalp Patra) ahead of Bihar Assembly Elections 2025Hindustan Times | Hindustan Times | Getty ImagesThe electoral victory for Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's party in a key state is set to pave the way for New Delhi to make farm-related concessions, a central demand of U.S. trade negotiators.The National Democratic Alliance (NDA), led by Bhartiya Janta Party (BJP), is poised for landslide victory in Bihar with trends showing it leading in nearly 200 of the 243 seats, while the opposition is ahead in less than 30 seats, data from India's election commission shows.A strong and positive verdict from Bihar — India's third most populous state and a large producer of corn — is expected to encourage the government to conclude a trade deal with the U.S. Such a deal would include purchases of more agricultural products from the U.S., said Amitendu Palit, senior research fellow and research lead at the Institute of South Asian Studies.However, these purchases of farm products from the U.S. will be \"couched in a manner that does not suggest that the government is going to back away on its commitment to domestic farmers,\" he said.Indian exports to the U.S. currently face some of the highest tariffs, of 50%, but the two sides have been engaged in negotiations for a \"fair trade deal.\"In September, U.S. President Donald Trump doubled down on his criticism of India, calling trade ties with the country \"a totally one-sided disaster!\" Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick later asserted this position in an interview with Axios stating \"India brags about having 1.4 billion people but won't buy even a small amount of American corn.\"During Indian Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal's visit to Washington in late September, Indian officials reportedly acknowledged that \"fresh offers have been made,\" including discussions to buy corn for ethanol production.While several rounds of trade negotiations have occurred between the two countries, and U.S. has since softened its stance with Trump even hinting that Washington will reduce tariffs on India, a trade deal has been elusive.watch nowThe Indian government is waiting for the Bihar elections to end to finalise a trade deal with the U.S., said Praveen Jagwani, CEO of UTI International, adding that New Delhi has made some concessions around farm related issues.Despite trade negotiation pressures, substantial barriers to U.S. corn imports persist, S&P Global said in a note on Oct 2.  India has banned genetically modified crop imports and 94% of U.S. corn consists of GMO varieties, S&P noted adding that India's tariff structure \"imposes a 15% duty on corn imports up to 500,000 mt, with rates jumping to 50% beyond that threshold.\"Easing of these terms could raise \"dumping concerns that could impact domestic farmers\" S&P said. Proposals to import maize from the U.S. is already causing discomfort among farmers, according to local media reports in October.The NDA win in Bihar will give the government some political room to push for regulated maize imports which can be used as poultry feed under the U.S.-India trade talks, M.J. Khan president of Indian council for food and agriculture told CNBC in a written statement.He added however that the government may not approve genetically modified maize, as farmer sensitivities are \"still too strong.\"More major state elections are due next year, such as in West Bengal, Tamil Nadu, and Kerala — all states, where farming lobbies are significant — followed by Uttar Pradesh in 2027.  \"Projecting a pro-farmer image, while balancing trade interests and strategic ties with the US, will be the priority for the BJP government,\" said Palit of Institute of South Asian Studies.",

    "body": "Nikolas Kokovlis | Nurphoto | Getty ImagesAlphabet and Disney on Friday announced that they've reached a deal to restore content from ABC and ESPN onto Google's YouTube TV.The deal comes after a two-week standoff between the two companies that started on Oct. 31. The stalemate resulted in numerous live sporting events, including college football games and two Monday Night Football games, being absent from the popular streaming service.\"We're happy to share that we've reached an agreement with Disney that preserves the value of our service for our subscribers and future flexibility in our offers,\" YouTube said in a statement. \"Subscribers should see channels including ABC, ESPN and FX returning to their service over the course of the day, as well as any recordings that were previously in their Library. We apologize for the disruption and appreciate our subscribers' patience as we negotiated on their behalf.\"Disney Entertainment's co-chairs Alan Bergman and David Waldman, along with ESPN Chairman Jimmy Pitaro, said in a statement that said the agreement reflects \"how audiences choose to watch\" entertainment. \"We are pleased that our networks have been restored in time for fans to enjoy the many great programming options this weekend, including college football,\" they said. More than 20 Disney-owned channels were removed from YouTube TV, which offered its subscribers $20 credits this week due to the dispute. In addition to ABC and ESPN, other networks that were unavailable included FX, NatGeo, Disney Channel and Freeform. The main sticking point between the two companies was the rate Disney charges YouTube TV for its networks. Disney's most valuable channel, ESPN, charges carriage of more than $10 a month per pay-TV subscriber, a higher fee than any other network in the U.S., CNBC previously reported.It's not the first conflict this year between YouTube and legacy media.NBCUniversal content was nearly removed from YouTube TV before the companies reached an agreement in October, preventing shows like \"Sunday Night Football\" and \"America's Got Talent\" from being pulled.YouTube TV also found itself in a standoff with Fox in August that almost resulted in Fox News, Fox Sports and other Fox channels going dark on the service just before the start of the college football season. The two sides were able to strike a deal to prevent a blackout.YouTube said it has the option for future program packages with Disney and other partners. Disney said that access to a selection of live and on-demand programming from ESPN Unlimited, which includes content from ESPN+ and new content on its all-inclusive digital service coming later this year, will be available on YouTube TV to base plan subscribers at no additional cost by the end of 2026.Disclosure: Comcast is the parent company of NBCUniversal, which owns CNBC. Versant would become the new parent company of CNBC upon Comcast's planned spinoff of Versant.WATCH: Google has a lot more leverage over Disney in their carriage fight: LightShed's Rich Greenfieldwatch now",

    "body": "Move over, coastal hubs: many of the best cities for Gen Z workers are located in the Midwest, according to a new report from Checkr, an HR technology company.Using data from the US Census Bureau and the Bureau of Economic Analysis, Checkr ranked the top cities for Gen Z workers based on their scores in three key areas: employment, affordability and social life.Checkr calculated the employment score for each city based on its unemployment rate and labor force participation. To determine the affordability score, Checkr analyzed income to rent ratio, real personal income and the percentage of renters paying over 30% of their income.Each city's social life score is based on the Gen Z portion of the population in each city and the number of Gen Z members per entertainment establishment. Employment and affordability were weighted 40% each, while social life was weighted 20%.For Gen Z workers making entry-level salaries, \"it's going to be really difficult to survive and save money\" in major cities like Los Angeles and New York, according to Sam Radbil, research and content strategist at Checkr.Cities like Des Moines and Milwaukee may not have the same hustle and bustle, but they can offer lower costs of living and slower-paced lifestyles, Radbil says.The cities on this list provide both \"career momentum and lifestyle alignment in a single package,\" he says.Based on Checkr's data, these are the top 10 U.S. cities for Gen Z workers.1. Madison, WisconsinMadison secured the top spot because of its proximity to the University of Wisconsin-Madison, Radbil says.Students from all over the country are drawn to the school due to its academics, sports and social scene, Radbil says, and the city is a \"great starting point\" for grads to begin their careers.Beyond the university, Madison's proximity to Chicago and Milwaukee means that young people have access to \"very strong job opportunities\" in the area, according to Radbil.2. Minneapolis, MinnesotaOne of the larger cities in the Midwest, Minneapolis offers city comforts paired with a low cost of living.Minneapolis is also attractive to Gen Z workers because of its progressive values and welcoming social scene, Radbil says.3. Des Moines, IowaDes Moines has a thriving insurance industry, which provides ample job opportunities for Gen Z workers interested in that sector, Radbil says.Beyond that, the city offers affordability and a low cost of living, which provide \"a growing appeal to younger workers who want a meaningful start without that big city burnout.\"4. Omaha, NebraskaOmaha \"blends that Midwestern charm with pretty real economic momentum,\" according to Radbil.Gen Z workers can find ample jobs in the insurance, finance and education sectors, and a \"small startup ecosystem\" is also developing, Radbil says.Notably, legendary investor Warren Buffett calls Omaha home, he says.5. Nashville, TennesseeNashville is best known for its music roots, but the city also boasts a growing tech presence and a \"very cool entrepreneurial scene,\" Radbil says.Radbil compares Nashville to Austin \"without the insane rent prices yet,\" although the city's popularity is likely to drive up the cost of living, he says.Still, Gen Z workers are attracted to Nashville because \"the lifestyle there is so appealing,\" he says.6. St. Louis, MissouriAffordability is the main draw for St. Louis, Radbil says.Its low cost of living is attractive to young workers looking to settle down and purchase a home, according to Radbil.\"St. Louis gives you that opportunity to maybe get a start for a lower price, and really feel like you have some roots and you own something, which is important to people,\" he says.7. Austin, TexasAustin is a \"Gen Z magnet,\" according to Radbil.The city's atmosphere is \"very young and culturally rich, and there's so much to do outside,\" he says.Economically, Austin is also flourishing: its business-friendly environment has attracted large companies like Tesla and Apple, and the startup scene is booming, according to Radbil.As a result, \"the job market is incredible,\" Radbil says.8. Milwaukee, WisconsinMilwaukee is an attractive option for Gen Z workers due to its strong job market and reasonable cost of living, according to Radbil.While young professionals may only be able to afford tiny studios in major cities, in Milwaukee, \"you could get an apartment overlooking Lake Michigan,\" Radbil says.The city also offers a robust social scene and \"amazing\" summer weather, he says.9. Salt Lake City, UtahSalt Lake City is \"one of the most balanced cities for Gen Z workers\" due to its growing economy, access to nature and relative affordability, Radbil says.It's also an \"awesome location\" for young professionals who work remotely, he says: \"All those mountain towns and cities out west have really grown in popularity.\"10. Boston, MassachusettsBoston is home to \"world-class\" universities like Harvard University and MIT, which attract thousands of young professionals across industries.\"The universities are so important to creating jobs for people,\" he says. \"Whether it's science or biotech or just working at the university, I think that the job opportunities there are awesome.\"Want to level up your AI skills? Sign up for Smarter by CNBC Make It's new online course, How To Use AI To Communicate Better At Work.

    "body": "Job seekers wait to enter the SacJobs Career job fair in Sacramento, California, US, on Thursday, Nov. 13, 2025. David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesThe first economic data report that went unreleased due to the government shutdown will be released next week, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said Friday.As the U.S. government reopens for business, Wall Street's attention now turns toward when critical data on employment, inflation and other economic signposts will be released.The first such report, on September nonfarm payrolls, will come out Thursday at 8:30 a.m., according to a BLS update posted on its website.A day later, the BLS will release real earnings, a companion report to the monthly consumer price index that did not come out simultaneously in October because average earnings earnings, which are part of the payrolls report, were not released. Real earnings are the difference between the monthly CPI reading and the average hourly earnings.In fact, September CPI was the only official data point released during the shutdown due to its role in computing the cost of living adjustment for Social Security benefits.Economists expect that the \"employment situation\" report, as it is known, to include just the nonfarm payrolls count and not the unemployment rate.That's because the report entails two surveys: a more objective look at \"hard data\" from businesses that uses timecards and payroll numbers to assess how many jobs have been filled, and another entailing telephone calls and written surveys to households asking how many people are working. The latter survey is used to calculate the jobless rate and would be difficult to replicate.The Commerce Department, including the Bureau of Economic Analysis, had not posted revised schedules as of Friday morning, but updates are expected soon.Uncertainty on other releases casts another cloud over what has become an increasingly contentious policymaking atmosphere at the Federal Reserve — not to mention the nervous climate among investors.\"The absence of timely official numbers left the markets and the Fed operating in a data fog, forced to scour alternate sources to gauge the underlying outlook,\" Bank of America economist Shruti Mishra said in a note. \"With the shutdown resolved, all eyes will now be on the incoming data dump.\"The shutdown not only halted data collection and releases, but it also complicated the picture once the data does start coming out.watch nowFor instance, the October CPI report may never be compiled, owing also to the method used to gather data. The Bureau of Labor Statistics uses in-person visits, so the data can't be collected retroactively. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt warned Wednesday about missing data, but Mishra said she wasn't expecting the CPI report even before that.A statement on the BLS site asks for patience during the data collection process as \"it may take time to fully assess the situation and finalize revised release dates.\" Similarly, the BEA, which releases several key data points including the Fed's inflation gauge, said it is working with the BLS and other agencies on data collection and \"will publish updated release dates as soon as they are available.\"Political pressureIn the meantime, some Democratic lawmakers already are getting impatient and demanding answers from the administration about when the data will be released.Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Bernie Sanders of Vermont, Maria Cantwell of Washington and Gary Peters of Michigan insisted that \"government shutdowns do not inherently inhibit the federal government from collecting or releasing economic data,\" according to a letter obtained by CNBC.comCiting precedent from the October 2013 shutdown, in which the BLS later published release dates, the administration \"may be intentionally restricting the release of data.\"\"The Trump Administration's failure to release data or provide a clear schedule for the release of delayed data leaves businesses and policymakers without access to critical economic information,\" the letter states. \"It is critical that businesses, consumers, workers, Congress, and the Fed have access to timely and comprehensive economic data. The Administration must release as much economic data as possible before the Fed's meeting and resume normally scheduled data releases as soon as possible.\"White House officials did not respond to a request for comment.Waiting for the FedSince Leavitt's statement Wednesday, several officials did say data would be forthcoming but there are still questions on which reports will come out when. Labor Secretary Lori Chavez-DeRemer said data on payrolls and prices will have to be assessed for accuracy before it can be released.\"I'm not sure when BLS, if and when they will be able to release that, but I'm expecting they will tell us a schedule very quickly about when those numbers could come out,\" Chavez-DeRemer said Friday on Fox Business. Chavez added that the White House has been \"urging for accurate data to come out for November.\"Citigroup economist Andrew Hollenhorst said in a Friday note that he is optimistic the Fed will have the September, October and November jobs reports by the time it holds its next policy meeting on Dec. 9-10. Fed officials in September indicated that a December cut would be likely, but several key officials have said recently that they are suspect of the need for additional easing.Outside of the payrolls and CPI report, the BLS also computes data on import and export prices, job openings, producer prices, productivity and other metrics. The Labor Department itself releases the weekly jobless claims numbers.Beyond the BLS and Labor Department issues, the Commerce Department also handles several key data points.Among them are personal income and spending, which includes the Fed's main inflation forecasting measure, the personal consumption expenditures price index, and gross domestic product. Data for October PCE is scheduled to be released Nov. 26. The Census Bureau handles retail sales, trade balance and durable good releases. Department officials did not respond to a request for comment.",

    "body": "Walmart logo is seen near the store in Austin, United States on Oct. 23, 2025.Jakub Porzycki | Nurphoto | Getty ImagesWhen incoming Walmart CEO John Furner steps into the retailer's top role, he will try to follow up a period of dramatic share growth that many of Walmart's rivals have failed to match.Walmart's stock has more than quadrupled since outgoing CEO Doug McMillon began in the role in February 2014. Across nine of the 12 calendar years when was Walmart's leader, the company posted positive stock returns.Among Walmart's main rivals in the retail and grocery business, only Amazon and Costco have had better stock returns since McMillon took the job. Meanwhile, Walmart's stock has outperformed those of competitors like Target, Dollar General, Dollar Tree, Kroger and Albertsons.McMillon will officially step down at the end of January, but will stay on as executive chairman and advisor. While Furner will face a challenge in replicating the company's performance under his predecessor, he has been a key catalyst for the company's success as CEO of its largest sector, Walmart's U.S. business.Along with huge gains on Wall Street, McMillon oversaw a significant period of growth for the nation's largest grocer, which included sharp sales increases, wage hikes for hourly workers and transformation of the nation's low-price leader into a major e-commerce player. He also steered the retailer through the tumult of a global pandemic, historic levels of inflation and higher tariffs.Sales during McMillon's first three years in the role were roughly flat — with revenues of $486 billion, $482 billion and $485 billion in the fiscal years ending January 2015, 2016 and 2017, respectively.Yet those years were followed by steady growth, and those gains have accelerated since 2021, after the Covid pandemic pushed more people to shop online and inflation nudged even wealthier shoppers to seek value. Walmart posted annual revenue of about $681 billion in the fiscal year ended earlier this year, an approximately 40% jump from the company's annual revenue the first year of McMillon's tenure.This year, Walmart is on track to post annual revenues of over $700 billion for the first time ever. Ironically, however, it is also expected to lose its crown as the largest retailer by annual revenue to its biggest e-commerce rival, Amazon.Earlier this year, Amazon leapfrogged Walmart in quarterly sales for the first time. Compared to Walmart, it has a different mix to its business because of its massive cloud computing, advertising and seller services businesses.How Walmart's stock compares to its rivalsStock gains by Amazon have outpaced Walmart's during the years of McMillon's tenure, with 1,225% share gains by the tech giant compared to a 312% increase by Walmart.However, Walmart's performance on Wall Street has far surpassed big-box retail competitor Target's across McMillon's time as CEO. Shares of Target are up about 60% since February 2014, compared to Walmart's 312% gains.During the years of the Covid pandemic, Target's steep share gains surpassed those of Walmart. Yet the Minneapolis-based cheap chic retailer's annual sales have been roughly stagnant for about four years and dragged down its stock performance.Like Walmart, Target is preparing for a leadership change in February. Last month, Target said Michael Fiddelke, its chief operating officer and former CFO, would succeed longtime CEO Brian Cornell.Costco also stands out as a competitor that has posted steeper share gains than Walmart. Shares of the warehouse club retailer, which competes with both Walmart stores and those of its warehouse chain, Sam's Club, have shot up by more than 700% during the years of McMillon's tenure.Walmart's supermarket competitors — Kroger and Albertsons, in particular — have lagged behind that. Shares of Kroger, which includes about two dozen grocery chains including Fred Meyer and Ralphs, climbed 265% during McMillon's tenure. Shares of Albertsons, which includes Safeway, Tom Thumb and other grocery chains, rose by only 16%.Albertsons went public in 2020, which gave it less time for stock gains. For about two of those years, from roughly 2022 to 2024, Kroger and Albertsons also sought to merge their two companies into a larger grocer that could better compete with Walmart, Costco, Amazon and others. The deal was ultimately blocked by a U.S. judge, after the Federal Trade Commission sued to stop the merger.Dollar stores also fell short of Walmart's stock performance while McMillon was CEO. Dollar Tree and Dollar General, who compete with Walmart in offering groceries and other items at low prices, posted 104% and 85% share gains, respectively, compared to Walmart's 312% increase.Notably, both dollar store banners' stocks outperformed Walmart's during some of those years, yet have been struggling more recently.Walmart's stock was about flat Friday following the retirement announcement, and shares have climbed about 13% this year.— CNBC's Tom Rotunno contributed to this report.",

    "body": "Nvidia President and CEO Jensen Huang speaks about NVIDIA Omniverse as he delivers the keynote address during the Nvidia GTC (GPU Technology Conference) at the Walter E. Washington Convention Center on Oct. 28, 2025 in Washington, DC.Anna Moneymaker | Getty Images As a handful of the world's most valuable companies set out to spend $1 trillion over the next five years on data centers for artificial intelligence, one line item is on the minds of executives and investors: depreciation.In accounting, depreciation is the act of allocating the cost of a hard asset over the course of its expected useful life. It's an increasingly important concept in the tech industry, as companies predict how long the hundreds of thousands of Nvidia graphics processing units, or GPUs, they're purchasing will remain useful or retain their value.Infrastructure giants like Google, Oracle and Microsoft have said their servers could be useful for up to six years. But they could also depreciate much sooner. Microsoft said in its latest annual filing that its computer equipment lasts two to six years.That's a lot to consider for the investors and lenders financing the giant AI buildouts, because the longer equipment remains valuable, the more years a company can stretch out depreciation and the less it hurts profits.Read more CNBC reporting on AIThis Meta alum has spent 10 months leading OpenAI's nationwide hunt for its Stargate data centersAI Sam Altman and the Sora copyright gamble: 'I hope Nintendo doesn't sue us'Anthropic launches Claude Sonnet 4.5, its latest AI model that's 'more of a colleague'Sam Altman on worries about OpenAI’s $850 billion in planned buildouts: ‘I totally get that’AI GPUs represent a particular challenge because they're still relatively new to the market. Nvidia's first AI-focused processors for data centers came out around 2018. The current AI boom started with the launch of ChatGPT in late 2022. Since then, Nvidia's annual data center revenue has jumped from $15 billion to $115 billion in the fiscal year that ended in January.There's no real track record for how long GPUs last when compared with other types of heavy equipment that businesses have been using for decades, said Haim Zaltzman, vice chair of Latham & Watkins' emerging companies and growth practice.\"Is it three years, is it five, or is it seven?\" said Zaltzman, who works on GPU financings, in an interview. \"It's a huge difference in terms of how successful it is for financing purposes.\"Some of Nvidia's customers say AI chips will retain value for a long time and that customers will continue to pay for access to older processors because they'll still be useful for other tasks. CoreWeave, which buys GPUs and rents them out to clients, has used six-year depreciation cycles for its infrastructure since 2023.CoreWeave CEO Michael Intrator told CNBC this week, following quarterly earnings, that his company is being \"data driven\" about GPU shelf life.Intrator said that CoreWeave's Nvidia A100 chips, which were announced in 2020, are all fully booked. He also added that a batch of Nvidia H100 chips from 2022 became available because a contract expired, and they were immediately booked at 95% of their original price.\"All of the data points that I'm getting are telling me that the infrastructure retains value,\" Intrator said.CoreWeave CEO, Michael Intrator appears on CNBC on July 17, 2024. CNBCStill, CoreWeave shares plunged 16% after its earnings report as delays at a third-party data center developer hit full-year guidance. The stock is down 57% from its high reached in June, part of a broader sell-off reflecting concerns about overspending in AI. Oracle shares have plummeted 34% from their record high in September.Among the most vocal skeptics of the AI trade is short seller Michael Burry, who recently disclosed bets against Nvidia and Palantir.Burry this week suggested that companies including Meta, Oracle, Microsoft, Google and Amazon are overstating the useful life of their AI chips and understating depreciation. He pegs the actual useful life of server equipment at around two to three years, and said companies are inflating their earnings as a result.Amazon and Microsoft declined to comment. Meta, Google and Oracle did not respond to requests for comment.'You couldn't give Hoppers away'There are a number of ways AI chips could depreciate before six years. They could wear out and break, or they could become obsolete as newer GPUs are released. They could still be useful for running certain workloads, but with much worse economics.Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has implied as much. When Nvidia announced a new Blackwell chip earlier this year, he joked that the value of its predecessor, the Hopper, would deteriorate.\"When Blackwell starts shipping in volume, you couldn't give Hoppers away,\" Huang said in March at Nvidia's AI conference.\"There are circumstances where Hopper is fine,\" he continued. \"Not many.\"Nvidia now releases new AI chips on an annual basis, versus the two-year cadence it had before. Advanced Micro Devices, its closest GPU competitor, followed suit.Nvidia reports quarterly results next week.Amazon, in a February filing, said it decreased the useful life for a subset of its servers from six years to five years because it conducted a study that found \"an increased pace of technology development, particularly in the area of artificial intelligence and machine learning.\"Meanwhile, other hyperscalers are extending their GPU useful life estimates for newer server equipment.Microsoft Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Satya Nadella speaks during the Microsoft Build 2025, conference in Seattle, Washington, on May 19, 2025.Jason Redmond | AFP | Getty ImagesAlthough Microsoft plans to build AI infrastructure aggressively, CEO Satya Nadella said this week that his company is trying to space out its AI chip purchases and not overinvest in a single generation of processors. He added that the biggest competitor for any new Nvidia AI chip is its predecessor.\"One of the biggest learnings we had even with Nvidia is that their pace increased in terms of their migrations,\" Nadella said. \"That was a big factor. I didn't want to go get stuck with four or five years of depreciation on one generation.\"Nvidia declined to comment.Dustin Madsen, vice president of the Society of Depreciation Professionals and founder of Emrydia Consulting, said depreciation is a financial estimate by management and that developments in a fast-moving industry like technology can change initial predictions.Depreciation estimates, Madsen said, generally take into account assumptions such as technological obsolescence, maintenance, historical lifespans of similar equipment and internal engineering analysis.\"You're going to have to convince an auditor that what you're suggesting what its life will be is actually its life,\" Madsen said. \"They will look at all of those factors, like your engineering data that suggests that the life of these assets is approximately six years, and they will audit that at a very detailed level.\"-- CNBC's Jordan Novet contributed to this story.WATCH: Chris Wood: We've removed Nvidia from our portfolio, prefer China AI nameswatch now",

    "body": "Stephen Curry #30 of the Golden State Warriors looks on during the game against the Sacramento Kings during the 2024 Play-In Tournament on April 16, 2024 at Golden 1 Center in Sacramento, California. Rocky Widner | National Basketball Association | Getty ImagesUnder Armour and Stephen Curry have mutually agreed to end their 13-year partnership effective immediately, they said on Thursday.The sudden announcement separates Curry Brand, which makes basketball shoes and apparel, from Under Armour at a time when the sportswear brand is struggling to kickstart sales. As part of the split, Curry will maintain sole ownership of Curry Brand and is free to find another retail partner. Under Armour will release the Curry 13, the final Curry Brand shoe with Under Armour, in February.\"For Under Armour, this moment is about discipline and focus on the core UA brand during a critical stage of our turnaround,\" Under Armour CEO Kevin Plank said in a statement. \"And for Stephen, it's the right moment to let what we created evolve on his terms. We'll always be grateful for what he's brought to the UA team.\" \"What Curry Brand stands for, what I stand for and my commitment to that mission will never change, it's only growing stronger,\" Curry said in a statement. \"I'm excited for a future that's focused on aggressive growth with a continued commitment to keep showing up for the next generation.\" Under Armour's split with Curry was announced alongside an expansion of the company's restructuring plan. The company now expects it to cost $255 million, $95 million more than it previously said, including the separation of the Curry brand, additional contract terminations, impairment charges and severance costs. Under Armour's basketball business, including the Curry brand, is expected to bring in between $100 million and $120 million in revenue during the current fiscal year, which will end early next year, the company said in a news release. The separation is not expected to have a \"significant effect\" on Under Armour's financial results or profitability, it said.watch nowUnder Armour's breakup with Curry, one of the most successful and widely known basketball players of his generation, comes at a difficult point for the brand. The company has seen a revolving door of top leadership, sales have fallen for eight straight quarters and Plank is trying to position it as a premium brand at a time when consumers aren't spending as much on new clothes and shoes.Plus, the competitive landscape has changed dramatically since Plank founded the business in 1996. These days, even industry leaders like Nike are struggling to hold on to their market share in the face of upstarts like On and Hoka, which have been wooing top athletes and winning over a new generation of customers. To reignite sales, Plank has worked to fix Under Armour's assortment and redefine the brand more clearly in a strategy he said will begin to show up on shelves, stores and social channels this fall and winter season.Get the CNBC Sport newsletter directly to your inboxThe CNBC Sport newsletter with Alex Sherman brings you the biggest news and exclusive interviews from the worlds of sports business and media, delivered weekly to your inbox.Subscribe here to get access today.Under Armour shares have fallen about 40% this year. Nike and Adidas, which both have partnerships with an array of top NBA players, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.Curry's partnership with Under Armour had long been a focal point for the brand and presumably would have been a major part of its turnaround strategy. Given the state of Under Armour's business, the abrupt breakup raises questions about what may have driven the split.Over the last nine years, Curry was mentioned on just about every quarterly earnings call Under Armour held, according to a review of transcripts dating back to 2016. But in its most recent one last week, there was no reference to Curry or the partnership.The sneakers worn by Stephen Curry #30 of the Golden State Warriors before the game against the Minnesota Timberwolves during Round 2 Game 1 of the 2025 NBA Playoffs on May 6, 2025 at Target Center in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Jesse D. Garrabrant | National Basketball Association | Getty ImagesDuring the call, Plank talked about the brand's opportunities in football and intimated it could do more in basketball.\"You can take a category like basketball that's roughly $100 million globally for us all in. And we think to ourself it's incredible for a $5 billion company, that can't exploit that in a bigger, better way,\" said Plank. \"So being underscaled relative to the potential we have and the opportunity that we have to grow it. So we're approaching that positioning as to where do we have the right to play, the right to win, and we think we can just do a little better.\"Curry Brandwatch nowIn 2013, Curry shocked the sneaker world by signing with Under Armour over Nike. At the time, Under Armour was a much smaller brand, but Curry was drawn to the company's \"underdog mentality.\"Curry told CNBC Sport earlier this year he hoped Curry Brand will outlive his playing career and become a brand other athletes embrace — similar to Nike's Jordan Brand. The four-time NBA champion and two-time league MVP is 37 and nearing the end of his basketball playing career, and he has started to focus more on golf and other business activities outside of basketball.Curry Brand launched in 2020. In 2023, the brand signed a new long-term extension and made Curry the president, housed under Under Armour's banner. As part of that deal, the 11-time NBA All-Star was given 8.8 million Under Armour common shares, valued at $75 million at the time, in addition to other awards and incentives.Under Armour will continue to develop new UA Basketball products after parting with Curry, according to a statement.\"This move lets two strong teams do what they do best,\" Plank said in the statement. \"Under Armour is focused on product innovation and performance for athletes at every level. Curry Brand gets the independence to determine its own future. That's good for Stephen and good for UA.\" — CNBC's Jessica Golden contributed to this report",

    "body": "President Donald Trump is blaming the meat packers and U.S. cattlemen for rising beef prices, but the tariffs on beef from Brazil, Australia, New Zealand, Uruguay, feed, farm equipment and machinery are all adding to the price surge.The United States is a big buyer of Australian, Brazilian, and New Zealand beef exports.Brazil is the second-largest beef-producing country and the largest beef-exporting country in the world.Brazilian beef exports tracked by Panjiva plummeted in July and August after multiple tariffs resulted in a layered 76.4% total rate being implemented for Brazilian beef. Trump imposed a 50% tariff rate for many Brazilian goods in July. Beef exports have found a new home, being diverted to other markets like China.Exports of beef from Australia, New Zealand and Uruguay to the U.S. have also decreased as a result of tariffs.The pullback in exports has reduced supply and is adding to pressures in an already tight U.S. beef supply chain.\"When you impose an extra 50% tariff on a major supplier like Brazil, importers may keep buying and pass costs along, or they may stop buying, but that means less supply to meet the demand,\" said Dan Anthony, president of economic research firm Trade Partnership Worldwide. \"Either way, you expect prices to go up, especially when imports from Australia, New Zealand, Uruguay, and other key suppliers face new tariffs too,\" he added.The most recent consumer price index report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics for the month of September showed prices for a variety of uncooked beef products rising year over year between 12% and 18%.The compounding effect of tariffs comes at a time when the U.S. cattle herd is at near a 75-year low, and consumer demand for beef has grown.Beef cattle in a pasture at a ranch in Sonoita, Arizona, US, on Tuesday, Nov. 11, 2025. Bloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesCattle ranchers have had difficulties increasing the herd because of drought, which has diminished the amount of grasslands to feed their herds, and the higher costs in buying feed. Some imported fertilizers have faced double-digit tariffs, which have raised the cost of growing the crops (corn, soybeans) that are used in animal feed.Tariffs on essential items like steel and aluminum have also increased the cost of farm equipment (tractors, grain bins) and repairs.All of these added expenses carve out money from the coffers of ranchers and farmers that would be used for investing back into their operations.\"We're in one of the toughest cattle cycles in history,\" said sixth-generation Texas rancher James Clement III. \"We have the smallest pipeline of future cattle and even with today's prices, ranchers can't speed up the process to rebuild the national herd, which will take time, grass, and rain,\" he said.Replacement heifers are down to a 20-year low.Ranchers say it takes years to see a return on buying heifers.\"The fundamentals are tight, the runway is long, and the slightest shock makes an already fragile rebuild even harder,\" Clement said. \"This is a foreign concept to many other industries where production can be ramped up or down in weeks,\" he added.One of the biggest headwinds curtailing investment is the current political environment.\"Producers start second-guessing whether to hold back heifers or take the money today because uncertainty adds risk to ranchers wanting to retain or purchase heifers to rebuild their herds,\" Clement said.President Trump added to frustration among ranchers when he announced as part of a deal with Argentina in October having the country export beef into the United States to help lower beef prices, which the National Cattlemen's Beef Association said would harm rural America, comments that helped to sink the price of cattle futures.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconLive cattle futures trading chart year-to-date 2025 through November 13.\"We don't need Argentine beef because the U.S. already produces more high-quality beef than ever before,\" Clement said. \"The expanded Argentine quota entering our market, it would amount to less than half of one percent, about one extra hamburger per person, nowhere near enough to move the needle,\" he said.The U.S. Department of Agriculture recently acknowledged the dwindling herd numbers and announced a series of initiatives it hopes will encourage people to become cattlemen.The White House has become more focused on its affordability messaging in recent days after key GOP election losses around the country and Trump administration officials have said policies are coming to lower prices on some grocery staples not grown in the U.S. A group of coffee and banana-producing countries including Ecuador and Guatemala were included in a tariff removal plan the government said it had reached on Thursday.\"It's politically easy to slap tariffs on foreign competitors to defend domestic producers but the consumer usually ends up paying the cost,\" said Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer of OnePoint BFG Wealth Partners. \"Demand then shrinks, they eat chicken instead and the domestic producers end up no better off,\" he said.While there are many ranchers sitting on the sidelines waiting for better economic conditions and incentives to grow their herds, Clement is investing in his ranch and is continuing to buy heifers to grow his operation.\"Cattle are a great long-term investment and ranching is a great life,\" he said.In addition to climate and feed costs, U.S. cattle ranchers are concerned about the possible return of the New World Screwworm. U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins led the largest USDA trade mission to Mexico to discuss measures for combating NWS.The parasitic fly lays eggs in the open wounds of warm-blooded animals. The larvae then hatches from the eggs and burrows into tissue of animals to feed on them. If caught early, the sick animal can be treated and survive. Human cases are rare but can be painful and require medical attention. This parasite was successfully eradicated from the United States in 1966, but some cattle in Mexico have been found infected with the parasite and all Mexican beef imports have been shuttered.All of these supply chain challenges have added to the pressure on beef prices.\"We will adapt to market changes and New World Screwworm as ranchers have always done, by staying steady and calm in the face of all of the challenges that ranchers have always faced,\" Clement said.",

    "body": "watch nowPresident Donald Trump on Friday asked the Department of Justice to investigate relationships between notorious sex offender Jeffrey Epstein and former President Bill Clinton, JPMorgan Chase, former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers, billionaire tech investor Reid Hoffman, and others.Attorney General Pam Bondi said later Friday that she had appointed Jay Clayton, the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, to lead the investigation.Trump's statement comes as he faces renewed pressure over his own past friendship with Epstein, who killed himself in August 2019 after being arrested on child sex trafficking charges.In a Truth Social post, Trump claimed that \"Democrats are using the Epstein Hoax ... to try and deflect from their disastrous SHUTDOWN, and all of their other failures.Because of that, he wrote, \"I will be asking A.G. Pam Bondi, and the Department of Justice, together with our great patriots at the FBI, to investigate Jeffrey Epstein's involvement and relationship with Bill Clinton, Larry Summers, Reid Hoffman, J.P. Morgan, Chase, and many other people and institutions, to determine what was going on with them, and him,.\"This is another Russia, Russia, Russia Scam, with all arrows pointing to the Democrats,\" Trump wrote \"Records show that these men, and many others, spent large portions of their life with Epstein, and on his 'Island.' Stay tuned!!!\"Bondi, the attorney general, in a post on X, wrote, \"Thank you, Mr. President.\"\"SDNY U.S. Attorney Jay Clayton is one of the most capable and trusted prosecutors in the country, and I've asked him to take the lead,\" Bondi wrote. \"As with all matters, the Department will pursue this with urgency and integrity to deliver answers to the American people.\"\"Trump should release all of the Epstein files: every person and every document in the files,\" Hoffman posted late on X on Friday. I want this complete release because it will bring justice for the victims.\"\"I want this complete release because it will show that the calls for baseless investigations of me are nothing more than political persecution and slander. I was never a client of Epstein's and never had any engagement with him other than fundraising for MIT,\" his post continued on X. \"The call for an investigation is an obvious ploy to avoid releasing the files. Simply release all the files, and expose the people who had both deep and ongoing relationships with Epstein.\"\"I will do everything in my power going forward to advocate for the release of the files, to get justice for Epstein's victims, and to promote the values of truth our great country was founded on,\" Hoffman said. \"I refuse to bend the knee to Donald Trump and his slanderous lies.\"Trump's post comes two days after he hosted business leaders, including JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon, at a White House dinner.A spokesman for JPMorgan, in a statement to CNBC on Friday, said, \"The government had damning information about [Epstein's] crimes and failed to share it with us or other banks.\"\"We regret any association we had with the man, but did not help him commit his heinous acts,\" said the spokeswoman, Patricia Wexler. \"We ended our relationship with him years before his arrest on sex trafficking charges.\"Epstein had been a longtime customer of JPMorgan and also had been friends with former JPMorgan executive Jes Staley.In 2023, JPMorgan, without admitting wrongdoing, settled separate lawsuits by victims of Epstein and the government of the U.S. Virgin Islands, who had accused the bank of facilitating and benefiting from Epstein's sex trafficking of young women. The bank agreed to pay the group of victims $290 million, and to pay the USVI $75 million.CNBC has requested comment from Clinton, Summers as well as from the White House and the DOJ, about Trump's post.In a 1997 photo, Jeffrey Epstein, left, and Donald Trump pose together at the Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Florida.Davidoff Studios Photography | Archive Photos | Getty ImagesEmails released by the House Oversight Committee this week show Epstein and others talking about Trump.In a 2018 email thread about Trump's former personal lawyer Michael Cohen pleading guilty charges related to hush money payments on behalf of Trump, Epstein wrote, \"I know how dirty donald is.\"In another thread that same year, Epstein wrote of Trump: \"its wild. because I am the one able to take him down.\"Trump also faces a looming vote by the full House of Representatives on a petition demanding the release of criminal investigative files about Epstein that the DOJ refuses to make public despite prior promises to do so by Attorney General Pam Bondi and other Trump administration officials.watch nowTrump has denied having known about Epstein's decades-long abuse of underage girls and young women.The two men had a falling out in the early 2000s.Among the email threads released Wednesday by the House Oversight Committee is one written in April in which Epstein told author Michael Wolff that Trump \"knew about the girls.\" The email does not explain what Epstein meant by thatIn another email, written in April 2011, Epstein told his accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell: \"I want you to realize that the dog that hasn't barked is trump.\"Epstein, in the same thread, said that a person whose name was redacted in the email but whom lawmakers identified as a victim of his \"spent hours at my house with\" Trump.\"He has never once been mentioned,\" Epstein added.",

    "body": "Shoppers walk through Manhattan on Nov. 7, 2025, in New York City.Spencer Platt | Getty ImagesHigh-income consumers are trading down, Gen Z is spending less, and low-income shoppers are still struggling, according to many consumer companies that shared their latest quarterly results in recent weeks.Those trends may not bode well for the big-box and mall retailers that have yet to report their earnings. That is, unless the strength of their brands — or high-income consumers who see their products as a good deal — help them transcend the gloomier consumer climate.While the Atlanta Fed's GDPNow tracker is projecting 4% U.S. GDP growth in the third quarter, there are cracks showing in the economy. Earlier this month, U.S. consumer sentiment slipped to near record lows, fueled by concerns about higher prices and the federal government shutdown. Plus, private data sources show that the U.S. economy was losing jobs through late October.Investors will get a wider snapshot in the coming week. Some of the biggest names in retail, including Walmart, Target, Gap and Home Depot, will report their latest earnings and provide insights into how spending during the critical holiday season is shaping up.According to credit card data from equity research firm and bank Truist, sales have softened in recent weeks across many of the retailers that it watches. Sales trends slowed at Walmart, Home Depot and Lowe's in October after they saw solid sales in August and September, according to Truist.Wall Street has noticed slower spending, too. Michael Baker, a retail analyst for D.A. Davidson, said he now expects weaker holiday spending than he did before as consumers face a challenging mix of higher tariffs, slower job growth and pressure on lower-income households.He expects holiday sales to grow in the high 3% range year over year, down from the firm's previous view that holiday sales growth would accelerate from last year's 4.3% increase.\"There's just a lot of headwinds building for the consumer and a lot of the data we track [at retailers] was just really bad in September and even worse in October,\" he said.High-income shoppers trade downFor roughly two years, executives have warned investors that low-income consumers were spending less, dining out less frequently and growing picky about their shopping.Now there are more signs that high-income shoppers are watching their budgets, too. That trend could help some of the retailers reporting in the weeks ahead, such as Walmart, Dollar General and Dollar Tree, while hurting others such as Target and Best Buy.The fast-food industry saw traffic from high-income diners climb by nearly double digits in the third quarter, according to McDonald's CEO Chris Kempczinski. McDonald's, often seen as a bellwether for the economy, is gaining share with high-income consumers, thanks to deals such as its Extra Value Meals, he said on the company's conference call earlier this month.\"I think sometimes there's this idea that value only matters to low-income [consumers],\" Kempczinski said. \"But value matters to everybody, whether you're upper income, middle income, lower income, feeling like you're getting good value for your dollar is important.\"Sign at the entrance to an Applebee's in Midtown Manhattan. Erik McGregor | Lightrocket | Getty ImagesFast-food chains aren't the only ones benefiting from higher-income diners trading down.Dine Brands, which owns Applebee's and IHOP, is seeing a similar trend. With a 2 for $25 promotion at Applebee's and a $6 value menu at IHOP, the casual-dining chains are pulling customers away from higher-priced options.\"We're seeing a greater increase of higher-income guests joining us this year,\" Dine CEO John Peyton told CNBC, adding that the jump in traffic from that cohort is offsetting the decline in visits from low-income diners.High-income shoppers are also hunting for deals at retailers. Savers Value Village, which runs a chain of thrift stores across the U.S., Canada and Australia, said during its fiscal 2025 third-quarter earnings call that it's seeing growth in both its \"younger and more affluent\" customer groups.\"High household income cohort continues to become a larger portion of our consumer mix. It's trade down, for sure, and our younger cohort also continues to grow in numbers,\" CEO Mark Walsh said on a call with analysts in October. \"We couldn't ask for a better outcome.\"Consulting firm Alvarez & Marsal recently conducted a consumer sentiment survey that polled more than 2,000 shoppers and found 24% of respondents earning $100,000 or more a year are planning to spend less this holiday season.Joanna Rangarajan, a partner and managing director with the firm's consumer and retail group, said that could partially be because they plan to trade down — or already are.\"They're going to pull back spending in a variety of ways. They may do that by buying fewer things, they may switch to less expensive brands, or they may switch to lower cost retailers overall, or it could be a combination of any of those things,\" said Rangarajan.A person shops at a Manhattan clothing store, New York City, Nov. 7, 2025.Spencer Platt | Getty ImagesWhile lower-cost brands and retailers could be seeing their core consumers spend less, it might not matter as much if they're winning over new, higher-income shoppers.Walmart, in particular, has spoken about its gains among customers with an annual household income of more than $100,000. That dynamic has boosted the big-box retailer's business for more than two years, especially as shoppers across all incomes have felt pinched by higher grocery prices. The company has also made some strategic moves to woo wealthier shoppers, such as remodeling stores, launching a new grocery brand and speeding up home deliveries.Even the dollar stores have attracted higher-income shoppers.Dollar General CEO Todd Vasos said on the company's earnings call in late August that the retailer saw increased spending among its core customers, who tend to be lower income, despite \"worsening sentiment\" in the quarter that ended Aug. 1. But he added that Dollar General also saw growth among middle- and high-income consumers, which \"has been accelerating over the last few quarters.\"At an investor day in mid-October, Dollar Tree CEO Michael Creedon said higher-income households are the retailer's \"fastest-growing cohort.\"Value-oriented companies, such as Walmart and warehouse clubs, are best positioned to post strong results in the coming weeks as they attract deal-hunting customers across incomes, D.A. Davidson's Baker said.On the other hand, he said, Target and Best Buy are in a tougher spot as they lose market share. For example, Baker said Best Buy customers are trading down to big-box stores such as Walmart and club players such as Costco for lower-priced TVs.Younger consumers pull backGen Z and millennials are not spending the way they used to as they contend with a slowing job market, rising unemployment and the resumption of student loan collection, which the federal government restarted in May.The generational trend is particularly bad news for fast-casual restaurants, which skew toward younger diners. Fast-casual favorites such as Chipotle Mexican Grill, Cava and Sweetgreen reported that consumers ages 25 to 35 aren't visiting as frequently anymore. All three chains cut their full-year forecast following disappointing third-quarter results.At Chipotle, the 25- to 35-year-old cohort typically accounts for about a quarter of sales. However, those diners haven't been visiting the burrito chain's restaurants as frequently, instead opting to cook at home, according to CEO Scott Boatwright.\"This group is facing several headwinds, including unemployment, increased student loan repayment and slower real wage growth,\" he said on the company's conference call in October.Beyond their fast-casual meals — known colloquially by some as \"slop bowls\" — younger consumers are also trying to spend less on necessities, such as new glasses or contact lenses.The younger shoppers that glasses maker Warby Parker serves have been feeling \"increasingly ... uncertain about their future\" and \"more selective in their purchasing behavior,\" said Warby co-founder and co-CEO Dave Gilboa on the company's 2025 third-quarter earnings call earlier this month.\"We've seen a moderation in average order value or basket size in categories that skew younger,\" Gilboa said. For example, the company has seen shoppers pull back on its higher-priced frames in favor of its $95 option.In weakening economies, younger people can start to feel distressed earlier than older groups because they tend to earn less, have less money in savings, and are more likely to be unemployed, according to economists.In addition, companies across the U.S. have paused hiring, which puts younger consumers who have just graduated high school or college at a particular disadvantage, according to Allison Shrivastava, a senior economist for Indeed. Plus, a stream of recent job cuts has targeted many entry-level employees, worsening employment prospects for younger workers.The difference in unemployment rates between younger and older people is now starker than usual, Shrivastava said. The unemployment rate for workers between 25 and 34 years old hit 4.4% in August, higher than the 3.5% rate for the 35- to 44-year-old cohort and the 2.9% rates for the 45- to 54-year-old and 55 years and older segments. More recent data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics is unavailable due to the federal government shutdown.Shrivastava sees the pullback in spending as largely a response to the frozen labor market.\"We're starting to get some frostbite in the form of declining consumer spending,\" Shrivastava said, adding that \"significant\" layoffs could push the economy into a recession.Brands bucking the trendsA shopper carries a Coach bag at an outlet mall in Commerce, California, June 27, 2024.Eric Thayer | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesThough consumers have cut their spending in key areas, some companies have proved resilient because of their brand strength or the perceived quality of their products.Even as some younger shoppers bought fewer Chipotle burritos and Cava bowls, Coach parent Tapestry said it saw strong handbag sales in recent months — with Gen Z customers driving much of the growth.Tapestry, which also owns Kate Spade, raised its full-year forecast after beating quarterly sales and profit expectations.In an interview with CNBC, Tapestry CEO Joanne Crevoiserat attributed that to both the popularity of the Coach brand and younger shoppers who are spending on fashion rather than other areas. She said the company's research shows \"the Gen Z consumer specifically is highly fashion engaged, spending slightly more of their budget on fashion.\"She said the company has seen no difference in sales performance by income bracket, as it attracts shoppers from other generations as well as Gen Z.Coach's and Kate Spade's price points provide an edge, too, according to a note from Telsey Advisory Group. The companies' handbags have a significant price gap with European luxury brands — even as Tapestry brands raise price points.Even so, Tapestry disappointed Wall Street with a more conservative holiday-quarter outlook.Tapestry isn't alone. Ralph Lauren and Swiss sportswear company On are also finding growth across all consumer segments despite a choppy economy.On, which reported fiscal 2025 third-quarter earnings Wednesday, raised its full-year guidance for the third quarter in a row after seeing sales grow about 25%, bucking a slowdown in the sneaker market. The company's performance stands in stark contrast to competitors such as Nike and Hoka, which are planning for either a sales decline or slowdown in growth. In late September, Nike said it was expecting sales in its holiday quarter to fall by a low single-digit percentage. Deckers, the parent company of On's fellow buzzy footwear brand Hoka, trimmed its sales guidance for Hoka in October. Meanwhile, Ralph Lauren raised its full-year outlook earlier this month after seeing sales rise 17% in its fiscal 2026 second quarter. During a call with analysts, CEO Patrice Jean Louis Louvet said it saw \"balanced growth across men, women and younger cohorts.\"Ralph Lauren is benefiting because it has a higher-income core consumer, but the company has also worked to ensure its assortment is landing with shoppers and its brand is still relevant. One of the biggest holiday trends currently hitting TikTok is a \"Ralph Lauren Christmas,\" which combines the brand's old-money aesthetic with decor for those looking for a traditional holiday feel.\"This cultural strength has also been instrumental in attracting younger consumers,\" GlobalData managing director and retail analyst Neil Saunders said in a note. \"Our data indicate that the brand's penetration among younger demographics has increased. This is aided by designs such as the limited-edition Morehouse and Spelman College vintage collections, which resonate with younger consumers and play on their desire for nostalgia and heritage.\"Dutch Bros., the fast-growing drink chain, also saw growth from younger consumers in its latest quarter. The company's wide-ranging menu, from protein lattes to vibrant energy drinks, can be heavily customized, a feature that has proved popular with Gen Z consumers.\"We're seeing really incredible performance of those younger cohorts,\" CEO Christine Barone said during the company's conference call earlier this month. \"I think that during times like this, customers are choosing the brands that they love most and really deciding to spend their dollars there.\"Dutch Bros. reported quarterly same-store sales growth of 7.4%, fueled by a nearly 7% increase in traffic to its stores.Chili's, which is owned by Brinker International, also saw traffic to its restaurants jump in its most recent quarter. The casual dining chain has won over diners through a turnaround strategy focused on improving the in-restaurant experience, plus savvy marketing that pitted its prices against those of fast-food chains.\"Our customer base is very representative of the U.S. consumer across all income cohorts, but our cohort growing the fastest is actually now households with income under $60,000,\" Brinker CEO Kevin Hochman said on the company's conference call in late October.Others in the retail industry aren't worried about slow spending during the holidays.At the malls, buzzy companies such as Vuori and Alo, digitally native brands such as Princess Polly, and popular retailers such as Abercrombie & Fitch are drawing bigger crowds as the holidays approach, said Kevin McCrain, CEO of the retail business at Brookfield Properties, one of the largest U.S. mall owners.Even as the economy shows blemishes, he said the company hasn't seen a change in shopping patterns or demand for space by retail tenants. And he said he still expects spending across November and December to increase from last year.So does the National Retail Federation. The trade group expects overall holiday spending in November and December to grow by 3.7% to 4.2% year over year and to top $1 trillion for the first time, even as shoppers scout for deals and make tradeoffs.Mark Mathews, chief economist at NRF, said the group's consumer survey shows a larger percentage of shoppers are \"holding off\" for Black Friday and Thanksgiving weekend sales than a year ago. He added consumers are trimming back in other areas, such as eating out, so they have money set aside for gifts.\"At the end of the day, it's the holiday season,\" Brookfield's McCrain said. \"People get caught up in the lights and Santa Claus, and everyone wants to be positive and hopeful and just have a great time.\"",

    "body": "There are two ways to get back to the level of home affordability Americans had for much of the last decade, according to Realtor.com. Neither looks realistic anytime soon.In 2019, the mortgage payment for a median-priced home took up about 21% of median household income. Today, it accounts for more than 30%, reflecting sharply higher home prices and mortgage rates that have nearly doubled since January 2022, according to a recent analysis from the real estate listings platform.Barring a sharp drop in home prices, Realtor.com calculates that getting monthly payments back to 2019 levels would require one of two things:Household incomes rising 56% to a median of $132,171, up from $84,763 todayMortgage rates falling to 2.65%, down from 6.15% as of Feb. 6Neither option appears likely in the near term. Real median household income has risen only about 17% over the past 20 years, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. Mortgage rates are more likely to ease from their current 30-year fixed rate, though most forecasts still have them hovering near 6% through 2026.Even at that level, affordability gains may be limited. The National Association of Realtors projects that home prices will rise about 4% in 2026 as renewed demand runs up against stubborn supply shortages.\"The U.S. housing market continues to grapple with a persistent mismatch between housing supply and buyer demand,\" Hannah Jones, senior economic research analyst at Realtor.com, tells CNBC Make It. \"If buyer demand strengthens without a corresponding increase in supply, renewed price growth is likely.\"Limited housing supply remains a challengeA chronic shortage of homes continues to weigh on housing affordability. There is a nationwide housing shortfall of nearly 4 million homes, Realtor.com estimates, a gap that helps explain why lower mortgage rates or stronger wage growth alone may not be enough to deliver substantial affordability gains.\"You don't really solve an affordability crisis by subsidizing demand through artificially cheap financing,\" says Realtor.com senior economist Jake Krimmel. For costs to go down, the supply of homes has to better meet demand, he says.Supply has been slow to catch up in part because zoning rules and lengthy permitting processes often limit how much new housing can be built or where it can go, according to a separate Realtor.com report from 2025.Expanding housing supply through additional construction and policy changes remains critical to easing affordability pressures, particularly in supply-constrained markets, according to NAR.At the federal level, lawmakers have introduced bipartisan proposals aimed at zoning, permitting and construction bottlenecks, though most remain in early stages.More change is happening at the state level. Texas and California have passed laws to loosen zoning rules and streamline permitting, but the impact has been mixed so far.The timeline for closing the housing supply gap also varies sharply by region, according to a 2025 Realtor.com report. At the current pace of construction and household formation, the report estimates the supply gap could close within three years in the South and six and a half years in the West. The Midwest would need roughly four decades. In the Northeast, the gap would not close at all under current trends.Want to get ahead at work with AI?

    "body": "The logo for Google LLC is seen at the Google Store Chelsea in Manhattan, New York, Nov. 17, 2021.Andrew Kelly | ReutersMore than 900 Google workers have signed an open letter condemning recent actions by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Customs and Border Protection (CBP), urging the tech giant to disclose its dealings with the agencies and divest from them.The letter, citing recent ICE killings of Keith Porter, Renee Good, and Alex Pretti, said that the employees are \"appalled by the violence\" and \"horrified\" by Google's part in it.\"Google is powering this campaign of surveillance, violence, and repression,\" the letter reads. It goes on to cite that Google Cloud is aiding CBP surveillance and powering Palantir's ImmigrationOS system, which is used by ICE. The letter states that Google's generative artificial intelligence is used by CBP and that the Google Play Store has blocked ICE tracking apps.The letter also quotes a social media post by Google Chief Scientist Jeff Dean from early January, who wrote, \"We all bear a collective responsibility to speak up and not be silent when we see things like the events of the last week.\"\"We are vehemently opposed to Google's partnerships with DHS, CBP, and ICE,\" the employees wrote. \"We consider it our leadership's ethical and policy-bound responsibility to disclose all contracts and collaboration with CBP and ICE, and to divest from these partnerships.\"The letter calls on Google to acknowledge the danger that workers face from ICE, host an emergency internal Q&A on the company's DHS and military contracts, implement safety measures to protect workers — such as flexible work-from-home policies and immigration support — and reveal its ties with the government agencies to help all involved determine where the company will draw a line.\"As workers of conscience, we demand that our leadership end our backslide into contracting for governments enacting violence against civilians,\" the letter reads. \"Google is now a prominent node in a shameful lineage of private companies profiting from violent state repression. We must use this moment to come together as a Googler community and demand an end to this disgraceful use of our labor.\"Google did not immediately respond to a CNBC request for comment.The letter comes as employees place mounting pressure on tech CEOs to speak out against ICE. Just two weeks prior, employees representing Amazon, Spotify, Meta and more wrote a similar letter demanding ICE \"out of our cities.\"",

    "body": "Thomas Fuller | SOPA Images | Lightrocket | Getty ImagesCompany: Appian Corp. (APPN) Business: Appian provides business process management (BPM) solutions. Its products include BPM software, case management, mobile application development and platform-as-a-service. The company was founded by Matthew Calkins, Robert Kramer, Marc Wilson and Michael Beckley in 1999 and is headquartered in McLean, Va.Stock Market Value: $1.86B ($25.21 per share)Activist: Fivespan PartnersOwnership: 7.91%Average Cost: $29.73 Activist Commentary: Fivespan Partners, LP is a San Francisco-based investment firm founded in October 2023 by Dylan Haggart and Sarah Coyne. Prior to Fivespan, Haggart and Coyne were partners at ValueAct Capital and 80% of the investment team is from ValueAct. Fivespan, named after the unique five-stone arched bridge in Haggart's hometown, views itself as a bridge between the market and companies. The firm prefers \"behind the scenes,\" collaborative and amicable activism, but it would resort to a proxy fight if there were no other choice. We expect that Fivespan will look for board seats in situations where it believes it could add real value, but we do not expect the firm to pursue board representation as often as ValueAct does (i.e, in roughly 50% of core portfolio positions). Haggart has experience as a public company director. He served as a director of Seagate (2018-present) and Fiserv (2022-2024), where he delivered stellar returns over his tenures of 205.25% and 64.68%, respectively, versus 46.12% and 4.98% for the Russell 2000. Fivespan looks for high quality, idiosyncratic businesses with good, strategic assets. The firm does not advocate for selling its portfolio companies as a primary activist strategy, but it likes companies that people want to own. Accordingly, many of its activist campaigns could end with a sale of the company, providing two paths to shareholder value. The fund is a drawdown structure that holds investments for at least three to five years, aims to have six to eight investments at a time and averages $100 million to $300 million in each investment.What's happeningOn Jan. 27, Fivespan announced that it will continue meeting with management regarding the company's operations, strategy and governance, including whether it makes sense for a Fivespan employee to join the company's board.Behind the scenesAppian provides mission critical business process and management software solutions to some of the largest, most complex enterprises in the world. Its customer base consists primarily of legacy businesses that operate outdated backend technology stacks, including large banks, telecom companies and even the Department of Defense. Appian's software is deeply embedded into these companies' systems, resulting in extremely high switching costs. As a result, customers hardly ever leave, with gross retention at approximately 99%. Moreover, Appian and its peers have penetrated only about 10% of what could be a $90 billion market. As a result, the company benefits from consistent mid-teens revenue growth, mostly from new business with current clients. Despite this compelling backdrop, Appian shares trade at roughly 2-times sales and 3-times gross profit – more than a 50% discount to similarly situated peers.With Appian's stock down 89% over the past five years, Fivespan Partners has entered the picture filing a 13D disclosing a 6.16% position in Appian and announced that it will continue to have meetings with management regarding the company's operations, strategy and governance, including whether it makes sense for a Fivespan employee to join the company's board. Any changes made or board representation would have to come at the invitation of the current board as Appian is effectively a controlled company. Appian co-founder CEO, chairman, and president Matthew Calkins controls about 39% of the voting power, two of the other three founders are on the nine-person board with many other directors being former employees of Appian or having relationships with Calkins. But that is OK. Going back to his ValueAct days, Dylan Haggart has had a lot of experience and success working with controlled companies like KKR and The New York Times, the latter of which is also a current Fivespan portfolio position.There are at least three solvable issues that have driven Appian's discount. First is that the market has a fundamental misconception around Appian's artificial intelligence risk. As is the problem with many software companies, Appian has been broadly categorized as an \"automation\" company, leading it to be lumped in with businesses genuinely exposed to AI disruption, such as customer service or chatbot-driven automation. Appian's automation, however, is entirely different, as it is focused on creating and implementing complex backend processes. Nevertheless, this branding has forced it to be painted with the same brush, and in today's market, anything associated with automation is being sold off indiscriminately. Anyone who looks at Appian's financials' can recognize the fallacy of this bear case, as the company's growth and retention metrics look nothing like those of companies with actual AI risk. The problem here is that Appian has thus far failed to communicate this to the market. The company's four founders – Matthew Calkins, Michael Beckley, Robert Kramer, Marc Wilson – are tech guys, mostly college buddies who started this company out of a garage. These are not guys who want to talk to the market, and the company's lack of an investor relations professional further underscores that. Thus, communicating this narrative to the market and perhaps even finding someone to fill this role for the company are both areas where Fivespan could add immediate value.Second is a lack of focus on margins. Historically, management, like many other growth companies, has prioritized top-line growth with limited attention to the company's profitability, leaving Appian's free cash flow margins in the low single digits, while comparable businesses like Pega generate margins north of 30%. With Fivespan now involved, this is likely to begin to change. Appian's recurring and sticky revenue model should allow them to pursue both revenue growth while expanding margins, by ensuring that incremental growth generates incremental profitability. While margins won't jump overnight, they should improve steadily each quarter as costs continue to grow more slowly than revenue, something we have observed from larger peers like Pega and ServiceNow. It is important to note that this is not a situation where layoffs and cost-cutting will lead to margin improvement, just being conscious of incremental costs as revenue increases should significantly benefit the bottom line.Lastly is capital allocation. As margins expand, Appian should become a cash cow, making disciplined capital allocation increasingly important for a company that hasn't had the strongest track record of doing so. This is where we see Haggart adding the most value. Some of the best activism occurs when a good activist gets on the board of a good company and management continues to do what they do best – run the business generating significant free cash flow, and an activist like Haggart does what he does best – help advise the board the best way to spend the cash flow to maximize shareholder value. This is one thing ValueAct is known for and that Haggart did extremely well at companies like Seagate. And this is an even more important skill to have on Appian's board, as the company is on the verge of coming into an at least $500 million windfall from a corporate espionage lawsuit filed against Pega. Appian sued Pega in 2020 and won a $2.036 billion verdict in 2022. The Virginia Court of Appeals overturned the verdict in 2024 and remanded it back to the lower court for a new trial. However, Appian had partly insured the verdict in the amount of $500 million, meaning that if it's ultimately awarded less than $500 million, the insurance company will make up the difference. If it's awarded more than $500 million, it is theirs to keep and the insurance company is off the hook. So, it is just a matter of time before Appian receives at least $500 million, which is more than 25% of the company's entire market cap.In the firm's other three campaigns, Fivespan has demonstrated that it prefers \"behind the scenes,\" collaborative and amicable activism — and that's a good thing as it doesn't have any other choice here. However, while any strategic, operational, or governance changes are ultimately in the company's discretion, we think Appian and Fivespan are rowing in the same direction. Moreover, we think the company would benefit greatly from the addition of a minority shareholder representative on the board, like Haggart or another Fivespan executive. One of the benefits of having a hedge fund representative on the board is that the board not only gets the director's advice and counsel, but the resources of the entire firm and its team of analysts. This is particularly important when there are crucial capital allocation decisions to be made. Ultimately, this will be an activist-lite campaign and Haggart knows that he can only be effective here with the blessing and invitation of the founder. We expect he will proceed with that in mind.Ken Squire is the founder and president of 13D Monitor, an institutional research service on shareholder activism, and the founder and portfolio manager of the 13D Activist Fund, a mutual fund that invests in a portfolio of activist investments.",

    "body": "A snow removal machine is seen working while a Boeing 737 American Airlines passenger aircraft is parked at gate on the tarmac of LaGuardia airport in New York on January 25, 2026. Charly Triballeau | Afp | Getty ImagesAmerican Airlines' promised turnaround is off to a rocky start this year.Pilot and flight attendant unions have called CEO Robert Isom's leadership into question as the airline's performance has trailed its rivals by a wide margin, a trend that has translated to lower profit-sharing for American's more than 130,000 employees. Adding to employee frustration, the airline struggled to recover from major winter storms in recent weeks and crews were left stranded — some without a place to sleep beside the airport.Late Friday, the pilots' union wrote to the airline's board, seeking a meeting to discuss the carrier's financial and operational challenges.\"Our airline is on an underperforming path and has failed to define an identity or a strategy to correct course,\" the board of directors of the Allied Pilots Association wrote. The union called for \"leaders who are willing, equipped, and empowered to get the house in order.\"Isom replied on Saturday that as board member and chief executive it is \"most appropriate\" to meet as soon as possible. \"The Board and I are aligned with you in the desire to make American the strongest airline possible in every respect,\" he wrote.American made $111 million last year, an amount eclipsed by profits from Delta Air Lines and United Airlines, which brought in $5 billion and more than $3.3 billion, respectively, even though American flew similar capacity in 2025.\"I know that it is a meager profit-sharing, a very small profit-sharing pool this year. Again, when you break even, that's the kind of profit-sharing you have,\" Isom told employees after releasing earnings results on Jan. 27, according to a recording of the event that was reviewed by CNBC. \"I'm disappointed in that.\"'2026 can't just feel different'American is trying to catch up to rivals with premium products that bring in higher fares, a bright spot in the industry as coach cabin revenue growth has been elusive. It has also worked to reverse the damage from a failed direct-to-traveler business-travel strategy, whose architect American ousted in May 2024. 2026 is crucial for the carrier. The Fort Worth, Texas-based airline issued an upbeat outlook for the year on Jan. 27, and Isom told crews that he was optimistic about improvement this year. He also noted that many staff, like flight attendants, make more than their counterparts at United, where cabin crews and other employees are in contract negotiations.Isom is leading what he has pitched as a major transformation of American. The strategy includes improving customer service, the network and revenue management.This week, he took his message to about 6,000 leaders at a conference the airline held at Globe Life Field in Arlington, Texas.\"We've had conversations as a senior leadership team about how we can't pass up any opportunity ... how we need to hold ourselves accountable,\" Isom said at the event, according to a transcript which was seen by CNBC. \"It starts with us at the top, but it's all of us here today and how you lead your teams. 2026 can't just feel different. It has to be different.\"American issued its 2026 outlook as it was juggling the aftermath of a late January winter storm that walloped much of the U.S. with snow, ice and sleet and preparing for another storm that ended up hitting its major hub of Charlotte, North Carolina, while competitors dug out faster.The financial results, coupled with the slow storm recovery, drew anger from both pilot and flight attendant union leaders, which together represent about 40,000 crew members. This week, two American Airlines flight operations leaders met with the union to discuss recent problems, and the union told members, \"Our pilots will not accept platitudes, empty words, and the absence of decisive action any longer.\" Association of Professional Flight Attendants President Julie Hedrick said on Jan. 27 that Isom, who became CEO in 2022, \"is missing the human factor\" and that \"many of us have been here for a very long time, and we don't see an ending that puts us in a better place.\"Isom acknowledged the trouble American's crew members faced during the late January storm that paralyzed a large swath of the United States and called the weather \"probably the most impactful\" during his decades-long tenure at the airline.Robert Isom, chief executive officer of American Airlines Group Inc., speaks during a Bloomberg Television interview in New York, US, on Wednesday, Dec. 10, 2025. Christian Monterrosa | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesTale of two Texas airlinesAmerican had an especially difficult 2025, which started with the collision of an Army Black Hawk helicopter into one of the carrier's regional jets that was arriving at Washington, D.C.'s Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport, killing all 67 people on both flights. The airline and its rivals were also hit by the U.S. government shutdown late last year.\"We're off to a fast start based on the booking trends we've observed in January, all-time records for the first three weeks of the year,\" Isom told analysts on the Jan. 27 earnings call.But investors also want to the airline to prove its progress.American's stock is roughly flat this year. Its competitor, 20 miles away in Dallas, Southwest Airlines, is also trying to remake itself, and its stock is up more than 30% in 2026. Shares of United and Delta are up more than 3% and more than 8%, respectively, for the year.Southwest's forecast that it could quadruple earnings this year has had investors in a bullish frenzy. That carrier recently sealed the biggest transformation in its nearly 55 years of flying (to some travelers' chagrin): assigning seats for the first time, adding its first-ever bag fees, and rolling out basic economy tickets and other changes. Investors' confidence boosted Southwest's stock to a nearly four-year high last month after it reported results.All U.S. carriers are investing heavily in higher-end travel over standard coach, and even Southwest is considering opening its first airport lounge, its CEO told CNBC last year.American is likewise revamping its wide-body planes with larger, single business-class cabins, putting in a three-class cabin on new Airbus narrow-bodies and expanding its airport lounges. The airline has also refreshed its food and beverage options, including offering Lavazza coffee and Champagne Bollinger. For its 100th anniversary this spring, it's also adding caviar and beef Wellington for long-haul premium cabins.Isom has said he expects half of American's revenue to come from \"premium offerings\" toward the end of the decade. Fight over ChicagoSeveral planes wait in line to taxi down a runway after a winter snow storm affected the area at O'Hare International airport on Nov. 30, 2025 in Chicago, Illinois.Jim Vondruska | Getty ImagesOne major battle for American is at Chicago O'Hare International Airport, where United CEO Scott Kirby, whom American fired in 2016, has vowed to keep his old employer at bay.Both carriers are ramping up their schedules there next summer. Deutsche Bank estimated in a note Monday that United generates about $10 billion in revenue at O'Hare and that American generates more than $5 billion. Around the time American reported earnings, United posted a digital billboard in Chicago that read \"More on time, less canceled flights. Aadvantage, United,\" using the same spelling as American's AAdvantage loyalty program. Bankrupt Spirit Airlines is also seeking to transfer two gates at Chicago O'Hare to United for $30 million, which would give United more ground at the airport.But from Chicago to Charlotte, questions still remain for American.\"It's unclear if the current strategy will close the margin gap to its peers,\" Melius Research airline analyst Conor Cunningham said about American. \"It will take a lot of time to execute. You can't just turn premium revenue on.\"Cunningham added, \"It took Delta over a decade to cultivate a premium image,\" pointing to the U.S. profit leaders' transformation.Read more CNBC airline newsBoeing outsold Airbus last year for first time since 2018, deliveries rise to 600Allegiant to buy rival budget airline Sun Country in $1.5 billion cash and stock dealWhy airline class wars will intensify in 2026American Airlines no longer lets basic economy flyers earn miles",

    "body": "Justin Tallis | Afp | Getty ImagesBitcoin broke above $70,000 on Friday, just one day after narrowly avoiding falling below the key $60,000 mark, as part of a stunning rebound. The token rose to as much as $71,458.01 on Friday, up more than 11% on the day. It was last trading at $70,411.33 as of 3:16 p.m. ET. The forceful rebound followed the flagship cryptocurrency's dive below $61,000 on Thursday, marking a 15% plunge on the day. It comes as some investors are snapping up bitcoin after its more than 50% decline from its record high above $126,000 hit last October. Stock Chart IconStock chart iconBitcoin, 5 daysThe reversal comes as stocks also rose on Friday, suggesting the market could close on a more positive note following a very volatile week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 918 points, or 1.9%. The S&P 500 added 1.4%, while the Nasdaq Composite traded up 1.5%.Investors' rotation back into risk-on assets drove stocks' surge amid fading fears over the threats posed by artificial intelligence technologies' to software firms. Several BigTech names rebounded, including Nvidia and Microsoft, which rose 6% and 1%, respectively. Those gains marked a stunning reversal from their near double-digit percentage point drops this week. Could bitcoin go lower again?Bitcoin is now trading close to its critical $70,000 level, sitting 45% off its all-time high. However, analysts said that bitcoin's earlier drop below $70,000 could signal further downside. watch nowOne firm, 10X Research, estimates bitcoin could go as low as $50,000, after a potential small bounce soon, Thielen said.\"I think we are going to have a little counter-trend rally that might go sideways or bounce a little bit,\" Thielen said. \"But I think during the summer we make another low.\"",

    "body": "watch nowThe NFL plans to hold talks with non-traditional media companies to potentially sell them the rights to a live game, NFL Media chief Hans Schroeder told CNBC Sport on Friday.\"We have other people that are both partners in a smaller sense — maybe not a full package — or people that still are in the media landscape somewhere that would like to be an NFL live game partner,\" Schroeder said in an interview from Radio Row ahead of Super Bowl LX in San Francisco. \"We're going to have those conversations,\" he added. \"We want to understand all our options and how to think about the best model for us, for our fans, for our teams going forward. So to your question, you know, we're going to listen and probably have a lot of different people that want to have a conversation with us. That's very fortunate. We say that humbly, and we're going to make sure we have those conversations to understand.\"Schroeder didn't offer details on which companies could be interested in buying a live game. The NFL sold a week one game to YouTube last season for about $100 million -- a one-off strategy that it could replicate with other digital platforms. The societal-wide shift to streaming has made digital a comparable rival to broadcast TV, which has long been the league's preferred distribution strategy due to its reach.\"Now you see these big digital platforms that can reach broadcast level audiences,\" Schroeder said. \"That just creates more optionality.\"Get the CNBC Sport newsletter directly to your inboxThe CNBC Sport newsletter with Alex Sherman brings you the biggest news and exclusive interviews from the worlds of sports business and media, delivered weekly to your inbox.Subscribe here to get access today.The NFL and its traditional media partners — Disney, Paramount Global, Comcast's NBCUniversal and Amazon — will likely begin discussing a new media rights later this year, four years ahead of the current agreement's opt-out clause, according to people familiar with the matter. Schroeder echoed NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell's comments to CNBC in September that the league would be open to having those talks.\"I'm sure they're doing work on their end when the time's right, because they either want to sort of press the 'engage' button or the commissioner says, 'Hey, let's go do this,'\" Schroeder said.The NFL is expanding the number of international games to nine next season — a record high. The league may sell a new package of some of those games to a media partner as soon as next year, he said.\"That'll be one of the things we look at,\" Schroeder said.",

We remain committed to the millions of Americans who depend on us for access to safe, affordable, and personalized care.\"Hims & Hers had previously said it planned to create a cheaper, copycat version of pharmaceutical giant Novo Nordisk's Wegovy weight-loss pill. That treatment — featuring Wegovy's active ingredient, semaglutide — was set to launch for as little as $49 for the first month. Novo's pill sells for roughly $100 more.Novo on Thursday threatened legal action against Hims for what it called \"illegal mass compounding,\" adding that the company planned to take legal and regulatory action. \"This is another example of Hims & Hers' historic behaviour of duping the American public with knock-off GLP-1 products, and the FDA has previously warned them about their deceptive advertising of GLP-1 knock-offs,\" Novo said in a statement at the time.On Friday, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration weighed in, announcing it planned to take legal action against Hims & Hers for the pill, including restricting access to the ingredients and referring the company to the Department of Justice.In response, Hims on Saturday said it \"has always operated with a deep commitment to the safety and best interests of consumers and in compliance with applicable law.\"The move comes as the company plans to run an advertisement during Super Bowl 60 on Sunday. The ad features rapper Common voicing the message that \"America's wealth gap has turned into a health gap.\" Hims previously said it expects the ad to \"ruffle some feathers.\"",

    "body": "Actor Austin Butler attends the 16th Governors Awards at the Ray Dolby Ballroom at Ovation Hollywood in Los Angeles, Nov. 16, 2025.Valerie Macon | AFP | Getty ImagesWith an affordability crisis taking hold, financial stability is in fashion. Whether it's wearing a quarter-zip sweater or the latest \"401(k) mullet\" hairstyle, young men, especially, are leaning into styles that give an air of monetary responsibility.\"Men not only found a voice but are finding their place through these trends,\" said Thomaï Serdari, professor of marketing and director of the fashion and luxury program at New York University's Stern School of Business.Clothing, hairstyles, music and even underwear have often been seen as leading economic indicators. For example, former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan believed that men's buying habits regarding underwear were a good indication of whether consumers were making fewer discretionary purchases.Here's what experts say these new trends show about how consumers feel toward the U.S. economy and the job market.The '401(k) mullet'The old 401(k) is now cool. These employer-sponsored retirement savings plans have been steadily gaining steam for years, but in 2026, they've tapped into the zeitgeist. A new NerdWallet survey found that 15% of adults wouldn't date someone who didn't have a retirement account. According to Vogue, the \"401(k) mullet\" is catching on, which is a more grown-up version of its shaggy predecessor.Jacob Elordi attends the premiere of \"Wuthering Heights\" at TCL Chinese Theatre in Hollywood, California, Jan. 28, 2026Unique Nicole | Filmmagic | Getty ImagesUnlike previous iterations, \"the 401(k) haircut is very contained,\" Serdari said. \"We are finally moving away from the time of the tech entrepreneur who drops out of college and yet will make tons of money,\" she said. \"People are slowly returning to a more put-together version of themselves with the intention of finding a job.\" Men want to \"emulate the lifestyle they want to achieve and, in that way, attract success,\" Serdari said.Social media seems to agree: When rapper T-Pain posted a photo of himself on Instagram in mid-November with the caption \"401k and a quarter zip,\" he garnered more than 122,000 likes. The 'quarter-zip movement'Since recent grad Jason Gyamfi started the \"quarter-zip movement\" in a Nov. 5 TikTok video, the sweater itself has become a symbol of how to look like an up-and-coming professional.\"What began as a simple style shift became a message — one that's inspiring people to grow, reinvent themselves, and carry confidence in everything they do,\" Gyamfi wrote in a Dec. 10 LinkedIn post about his viral video, which has been viewed more than 31 million times. Filadendron | Istock | Getty ImagesWith fewer job prospects, in part due to the rise of artificial intelligence, \"a lot of young people feel the odds are against them,\" Serdari said. \"They don't have a way of reaching the security their parents and grandparents had,\" she said.  Amid today's softening labor market, the traditional \"path to a stable job with a 401(k) and prospects of success and financial growth … is not guaranteed,\" she said.\"What used to be boring — the 401(k) — is unattainable and therefore sexy,\" Serdari said.Read more CNBC personal finance coverageHow Trump's child tax credit changes could impact your refund this seasonSome older Americans are 'unretiring' to keep up with cost of living: AARP surveyBitcoin sells off amid 'crypto winter.'

In the years that followed, the so-called K-shaped economy left the wealthiest Americans even better off than before, largely after benefiting from stock market gains and appreciating home values.Even when most Americans were living paycheck to paycheck, the trend toward luxury took hold in a big way once consumers caught Gwyneth Paltrow's courtroom aesthetic at her ski accident trial in 2023.Actress Gwyneth Paltrow enters the courtroom for her trial in Park City, Utah, March 24, 2023.Rick Bowmer | Getty ImagesA year later, TikToker Megan Boni posted a video that quickly went viral when she sang about trying to find a \"man in finance\" with a \"trust fund.\" That video was viewed more than 60 million times.Since then, the consumer economy has only become more bifurcated. Wealth continues to rise faster for those at the very top, data from the Federal Reserve shows, as the value of their investment holdings grows. The top 10% of Americans hold over 87% of corporate equities and mutual fund shares.\"People are searching to find a recipe for belonging, for making it in a world that has been exclusionary with a growing disparity between rich and poor,\" Serdari said.401(k) balances are growingMany of these workers are now exhibiting \"positive savings behaviors,\" according to Kirsten Hunter Peterson, vice president of workplace thought leadership at Fidelity Investments, the nation's largest provider of 401(k) savings plans.watch nowOverall, retirement account balances, which sank at the start of 2025 amid wild market swings, are at all-time highs, according to the latest data from Fidelity.  Near the end of last year, the average 401(k) balance hit a record $144,400, Fidelity found.\"When it comes to younger workers, many of them do get a bad rap [on saving for retirement], but the numbers tell a different story,\" Hunter Peterson said.While other research points to retirement saving shortfalls across generations, \"Gen Z is saving earlier and at higher rates than previous generations before them,\" she said.In part, Generation Z is more prone to sharing financial information and tips on social media and, in some cases, that is an extremely effective way to convey the benefits of saving for retirement, Hunter Peterson said. Still, there is no substitute for personalized recommendations from a vetted financial advisor, she added. \"When it comes to taking action, especially for younger investors, it's important to listen to a trusted source,\" she said. \"There are a lot of 'finfluencers' out there who are not licensed professionals.\"Subscribe to CNBC on YouTube.",

    "body": "Attendees during the Singapore Airshow in Singapore, on Wednesday, Feb. 4, 2026. The show runs through Feb. 8. Photographer: SeongJoon Cho/Bloomberg via Getty ImagesBloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesWith geopolitical uncertainty on the rise, defense buyers at the Singapore Airshow say they are prioritizing sovereignty, from local production and co‑development to owning the software and intellectual property that run their systems. Industry leaders say that control over hardware, software and supply chains is now a central factor in procurement decisions.Executives at the show, which closes on Sunday, pointed to shifting alliances and tougher rhetoric from major powers as a catalyst for the trend. \"There is a notion that is coming around very explicitly ... the notion of sovereignty,\" Pascale Sourisse, senior executive vice president for international development at French aerospace and defense firm Thales, told CNBC.Sourisse added that this mindset has helped drive defense spending higher as countries conclude they must look after their own security.Chua Jin Kiat, executive vice president and head of international defense business at Singapore engineering and defense firm ST Engineering, echoed the sentiment, and said that over the last 12 months, U.S. President Donald Trump's combative stance toward allies has pushed countries to realize that \"we may not be able to depend on others.\"Under the Trump administration, the U.S. has pushed its allies to spend more on defense, with NATO committing to spend 5% of their GDP on defense by 2035. Trump has threatened allies' such as Canada and most recently Denmark over its territory of Greenland. He has also reportedly said he would sell allies weaker versions of American weapons \"because someday, maybe they're not our allies.\"Chua added that countries are recognizing that old alliances and alignments may not be \"so enforceable or relevant\" anymore, even organizations such as NATO. \"So you can be a NATO member. But actually, at the end of the day today, what we are seeing is, first and foremost, if I'm Germany, I'm Germany. If I'm Finland, I'm Finland,\" he said. Supply chain resilienceA direct consequence of that shift is a renewed emphasis on boosting supply‑chain resilience. Companies told CNBC they are responding by localizing production, transferring know‑how, or partnering with domestic firms so customers can maintain and upgrade systems without long, fragile supply lines.Sourisse said Thales is not only marketing its solutions but also planning to localize activities and competencies. The company has set up joint labs in Singapore with local agencies to develop capabilities on the ground.ST Engineering's Chua said the company, constrained by Singapore's limited land area available for large factories, prefers co‑production arrangements overseas. For example, if ST Engineering can make advanced vehicles in a country with more space for production plants than Singapore, the company would collaborate and teach them how to build them in a co-production effort.\"For many of the big primes, they have to keep their factories at home running. They have got huge production plants, thousands of jobs, and the lights have to be kept on constantly.\"New kids on the blockSovereignty extends beyond factories to software and intellectual property. Newer firms in the defense tech space are becoming aware of those demands and are structuring deals accordingly.U.S.- based Shield AI, which develops autonomous warfare systems, signed a memorandum of understanding at the airshow to integrate its Hivemind autonomy software across selected ST Engineering platforms. Shield AI X-bat flight renderingShield AIThe company had earlier in 2025 partnered with the Republic of Singapore Air Force to use Hivemind to enhance the RSAF's autonomous capabilities.Brandon Tseng, co‑founder of Shield AI, told CNBC that Hivemind enables other companies and militaries to develop their own artificial-intelligence pilots locally, and Singapore would own that intellectual property. \"They can build AI pilots for whatever they want to do. We don't own [the IP],\" he told CNBC. Tseng added that while countries will continue to buy some foreign hardware, many want to indigenize critical capabilities such as AI and autonomy.",

    "body": "Goldman Sachs has been working with the artificial intelligence startup Anthropic to create AI agents to automate a growing number of roles within the bank, the firm's tech chief told CNBC exclusively.The bank has, for the past six months, been working with embedded Anthropic engineers to co-develop autonomous agents in at least two specific areas: accounting for trades and transactions, and client vetting and onboarding, according to Marco Argenti, Goldman's chief information officer.The firm is \"in the early stages\" of developing agents based on Anthropic's Claude model that will collapse the amount of time these essential functions take, Argenti said. He expects to launch the agents \"soon,\" though he declined to provide a specific date.\"Think of it as a digital co-worker for many of the professions within the firm that are scaled, are complex and very process intensive,\" he said.Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon said in October that his bank was embarking on a multiyear plan to reorganize itself around generative AI, the technology that has made waves since the arrival of OpenAI's ChatGPT in late 2022. Even as investment banks like Goldman are experiencing surging revenue from trading and advisory activities, it will seek to \"constrain headcount growth\" amid the overhaul, Solomon said.The news from Goldman comes as model updates from Anthropic, co-founded by a former OpenAI executive, have sparked a sharp sell-off among software firms and their credit providers as investors wager on who the winners and losers from the AI trade will be.watch nowGoldman began last year by testing an autonomous AI coder called Devin, which is now broadly available to the bank's engineers. But it quickly found that Anthropic's AI model could work in other parts of the bank, Argenti said. \"Claude is really good at coding,\" Argenti said. \"Is that because coding is kind of special, or is it about the model's ability to reason through complex problems, step-by-step, applying logic?\"Argenti said the firm was \"surprised\" at how capable Claude was at tasks besides coding, especially in areas like accounting and compliance that combine the need to parse large amounts of data and documents while applying rules and judgment, he said.Now, the view within Goldman is that \"there are these other areas of the firm where we could expect the same level of automation and the same level of results that we're seeing on the coding side,\" he said.The upshot is that, with the help of the agents in development, clients will be onboarded faster and issues with trade reconciliation or other accounting matters will be solved faster, Argenti said.Goldman could next develop agents for tasks like employee surveillance or making investment banking pitchbooks, he said. While the bank employs thousands of people in the compliance and accounting functions where AI agents will soon operate, Argenti said that it was \"premature\" to expect that the technology will lead to job losses for those workers.Still, Goldman could cut out third-party providers it uses today as AI technology matures, he said.\"It's always a trade-off,\" Argenti said. \"Our philosophy right now is that we're injecting capacity, which in most cases will allow us to do things faster, which translates to a better client experience and more business.\"",

    "body": "The Trump administration's portfolio of equity stakes in U.S. companies has reached a scale that is unprecedented outside economic crisis or wartime. The administration has taken stakes or has agreements to do so with at least 10 companies, most of which are publicly traded. The government announced its latest investment, USA Rare Earth, at the end of January. Democrats have also considered taking stakes in U.S. industries in the past. But the Trump administration's approach carries risks both for the companies involved and for the broader markets in which they operate. \"It is a invisible barrier to startups and new market entrants,\" said Scott Lincicome, an international trade lawyer affiliated with Cato Institute. \"Why would you ever want to enter a market that you know your chief competitor is backed by the U.S. government?\" Many of the investments are in smaller critical mineral companies, like USA Rare Earth and MP Materials, but they also include big industrial and tech companies such as U.S. Steel and Intel. Top administration officials like Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and Interior Secretary Doug Burgum have argued that the U.S. government is investing in strategic industries to reduce dependence on Tawain in the case of semiconductors and China for critical minerals. Historically, the U.S. has taken equity stakes in companies in the context of bailouts with the understanding that the investments were temporary and the government would exit its position when the company was financially viable again, said Peter Harrell, who served as the senior director for international economics under President Joe Biden. President Barack Obama, for example, took a stake in General Motors during the 2008 financial crisis and President Franklin Roosevelt took stakes in the banking sector during the Great Depression. But the Trump administration appears to be taking open-ended ownership interest that the U.S. government is unlikely to exit, Lincicome said. It sets a precedent that future Democratic presidents could use to invest directly in their favored industries like wind and solar, he said. \"I have yet to see a clear, coherent reason for why equity stakes are needed,\" Lincicome said. Federal support that falls short of ownership stakes like loans, government contracts and other awards are widely available, he said.  After the U.S. took its stake in Intel, Lutnick told CNBC that President Donald Trump wants the American taxpayer to benefit when the government gives money to corporations.But the administration's approach creates political, legal and business risks for the companies involved, Harrell and Lincicome said. It also raises potential conflict of interest concerns, they said. CNBC has reached out to the White House for comment.Political, legal riskThe Trump administration's approach is a major ideological departure for the Republican Party, which has traditionally championed free market capitalism and excoriated government intervention. The Democrats have typically been the party of industrial policy and intervention in markets.Sen. Bernie Sanders and Sen. Elizabeth Warren, for example, introduced an amendment to Biden's CHIPS Act that would have allowed the government to take stakes in companies that accept federal funding for semiconductor manufacturing. The measure ultimately died in the Senate. Democrats have also championed the idea of a national infrastructure development bank. At least one proposal for such an entity in 2021 would have allowed the government to take equity stakes in infrastructure projects. And Biden considered launching a sovereign wealth fund. These approaches would have relied on legislation passed by Congress. But the legal basis for the Trump administration's investments is a grey area, Harrell said. The administration seems to rely on the rationale that it can take stakes because the law doesn't explicitly forbid it and the companies have agreed to the deals, he said.  The lack of a clear legal basis makes the companies vulnerable to lawsuits from competitors, Harrell said. They are also likely to face political scrutiny if power changes hands in Washington, he said.\"If Democrats take control of one or both chambers of Congress in November, a bunch of the CEOs of these companies are going to be hauled up in front of committees to answer questions about how these deals are going,\" he said.Companies like MP Materials have acknowledged these risks in filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Pentagon's deal with MP includes a price floor and offtake agreement in addition to an equity stake. MP warned investors that it could face \"government audits, investigations, congressional scrutiny\" and \"inquiries about conflicts of interest.\" It also warned the deal faces \"the risk of litigation\" and is vulnerable to \"changes in federal administration and related executive and legislative priorities.\"Congress has also not set clear guardrails to minimize potential conflicts of interest and favoritism in the Trump administration approach, Harrell said. One concern is that the government could favor companies in which it is a shareholder in areas like permitting and contracting, he said. USA Rare Earth was required to raise at least $500 million in private funding as a condition for its deal with the government. Commerce Secretary Lutnick's former firm Cantor Fitzgerald led the placement for that funding. Lutnick stepped down from Cantor when he joined the Trump administration and transferred his stake in the firm to his children. Capital misallocation riskThe equity stakes also raise the question of whether the government can be trusted to make the right bets on companies and technologies that will succeed over the long term, Harrell said. A bad bet would result in capital flowing to less competitive companies, and investors are already speculating on which companies the government will invest in next, Lincicome said. \"That's just straight up capital misallocation,\" he said.Business decisions could also become politicized, he said. Big companies could decide to do business with the government-backed firms to curry favor with the administration, Lincicome said. In the case of U.S. Steel, the federal government has a governance stake, called a golden share, rather than an economic interest in the company. The White House intervened last September to stop U.S. Steel from halting production at its Granite City plant in Illinois\"That's your worst-case scenario, that you start having politicians in Washington directing important business decisions based on political considerations and not what's best for the long-term health of the company,\" Lincicome said. USA Rare Earth CEO Barbara Humpton told CNBC in a January interview that the government is taking \"taking an economic interest\" in its business \"not a governance interest.\" Lutnick told CNBC last August that the stake in Intel is non-voting and does not include governance rights.\"Maybe they don't have formal voting rights,\" Lincicome said of the government equity stakes. \"But they do have a phone and they can pick up the phone and call. They do have the ability to influence decisions that just don't show up on paper or in a proxy vote.\"And a Democratic president could try to force companies with government stakes to adopt progressive policies like capping executive pay or using unionized labor, Harrell and Lincicome said. Corporate silenceTop executives have voiced virtually no public criticism of the Trump administration taking stakes. Citadel CEO Ken Griffin said this week that some executives quietly oppose the interventionist approach. \"When the U.S. government starts to engage in corporate America in a way that tastes of favoritism, I know for most CEOs that I'm friends with, they find it incredibly distasteful,\" Griffin told The Wall Street Journal on Tuesday. The number of government equity stakes is likely to grow. Lutnick told CNBC last August the Pentagon was considering stakes in major defense companies like Lockheed Martin. Trump said in January that he \"will not permit\" defense companies to issue dividends or stock buybacks until the firms accelerate their production of military equipment. Before the U.S. took its stake in Intel, Trump said CEO Lip-Bu Tan was \"highly conflicted\" and called for his resignation over his ties to Chinese companies. The comments sparked a brief sell-off of Intel shares. Other corporate executives are likely worried about crossing the administration and being punished, Lincicome said.\"The best outcome here for your shareholders is just to stay quiet,\" he said.",

    "body": "The Trump administration has made unprecedented equity investments and obtained other stakes in at least 10 companies over the past year.Many are in critical mineral companies as the White House plots a strategy to directly back mining companies to build a domestic supply chain and reduce dependence on China. But the investments also include chipmakers and possibly a nuclear reactor company. In the case of U.S. Steel, the administration has taken a governance stake rather than a direct economic interest. The number of investments is extraordinary outside of wartime or an economic crisis, said Scott Lincicome, a trade lawyer and a researcher at the libertarian Cato Institute.And the administration's portfolio could keep growing. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told CNBC last August that the government could take stakes in major defense suppliers, such as Lockheed Martin.  In the past, the U.S. has taken temporary stakes in companies in the context of bailouts, said Peter Harrell, who served as the senior director for international economics under President Joe Biden. \"With these companies, it's a very different thesis,\" Harrell said. \"The government is kind of acting as a strategic investor to put capital into these companies so that these companies can achieve both a commercial return but also, at least in theory, some kind [of] national purpose.\" U.S. SteelPresident Trump secured a \"golden share\" in U.S. Steel as a condition for approving Nippon Steel's acquisition of the historic manufacturer.  The golden share is a governance stake that gives the president veto power over key business decisions. It is not a direct economic stake in U.S. Steel. The president can veto decisions to close, idle or sell U.S. Steel plants. He can also block U.S. Steel from changing its name, moving its headquarters from Pittsburgh or relocating the company outside the U.S. U.S. Steel stopped trading on the NYSE in June 2025 after becoming a subsidiary of Nippon. MP MaterialsMP Materials is a critical minerals company headquartered in Las Vegas that operates the only commercial rare earth mine in the U.S. at Mountain Pass in California. It has a market value of more than $10 billlion.The Defense Department struck a landmark deal with MP in July 2025 that includes an equity stake, a price floor and an agreement to buy a portion of future output. The Pentagon agreed to buy $400 million of preferred stock and is entitled to a warrant allowing it to purchase additional shares. MP said in July that exercising these options would give the Pentagon a 15% stake, positioning it as the company's largest single shareholder. IntelThe Commerce Department took a 10% stake in Intel in August 2025, buying 433.3 million shares of the chipmaker's common stock at $20.47 per share. Funding for the investment came from $5.7 billion of government grants under the CHIPS Act and $3.2 billion in federal awards under a program to make chips secure. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told CNBC last August that the stake is non-voting and does not include governance rights. Lithium AmericasLithium Americas is a critical minerals startup with no revenue that is developing a lithium mine in Humboldt County, Nevada called Thacker Pass. It has a $1.5 billion market cap. The Department of Energy took a 5% stake in Lithium Americas and a 5% economic stake in its joint venture with General Motors to develop Thacker Pass. In exchange, the department agreed to defer $182 million of debt service on a $2.3 billion federal loan over five years.\"If we're going to push out part of the repayment into later years, then the administration would like a very small stake of equity to create essentially a cash buffer and eliminate some risk on behalf of taxpayers,\" a Trump administration official told CNBC in September.Lithium Americas is based in Vancouver, British Columbia. It trades on both the Toronto Stock Exchange and the NYSE.Trilogy MetalsTrilogy Metals is another critical minerals startup with no revenue. It aims to develop a mining project in Alaska called Upper Kobuk Mineral Projects using a controversial, 211-mile-long Ambler Road to extract copper and other materials.President Donald Trump approved permits for to construct Ambler Road in October and the administration invested $35.6 million in the project. The investment makes the U.S. government a 10% shareholder in Trilogy with warrants to purchase an additional 7.5% of the company. Trilogy is also headquartered in Vancouver and trades on the Toronto Stock Exchange and the NYSE. USA Rare EarthUSA Rare Earth is yet another critical minerals startup that is also not generating any revenue yet. It is developing a magnet manufacturing facility in Stillwater, Oklahoma and plans to build a rare earth mine at a deposit called Round Top in Texas. USA Rare Earth has a $4.6 billion market capitalization.The Commerce Department issued a letter of intent on Jan. 26 to provide USA Rare Earth with a $1.3 billion loan and $277 million in federal funding.In exchange, USA Rare Earth will issue 16.1 million shares of common stock and 17.6 million in warrants to the U.S. The government will have an 8% to 16% stake in the company, depending on whether the warrants are exercised. CEO Barbara Humpton told CNBC in an interview that the government is \"taking an economic interest in the business, not a governance interest.\"WestinghouseWestinghouse is a private nuclear reactor developer. It is owned by publicly traded Cameco, a Canadian uranium miner, and Brookfield Asset Management. The Commerce Department signed a deal with Cameco and Brookfield in October to finance the construction of Westinghouse nuclear plants worth $80 billion. Under the deal, the government is granted a participation interest in Westinghouse and can require an initial public offering on or before January 2029 if the company's value rises above $30 billion.The government could become an 8% shareholder in Westinghouse under that scenario, Cameco Chief Operating Officer Grant Isaac said on the company's third-quarter earnings call in November 2025. Vulcan ElementsVulcan Elements is a private startup based in Durham, North Carolina. Vulcan entered into a $1.4 billion partnership with the U.S. government and ReElement Technologies to build a domestic rare earth magnet supply chain. Vulcan will build a 10,000 metric ton magnet facility in the U.S. It will receive a $620 million loan from the Pentagon, $550 million of incentives from the Commerce Department and raise $550 million in private capital.Under the deal, Commerce will receive a $50 million equity stake in Vulcan and the Pentagon gets warrants in the company. XLightXLight is a private company headquartered in Palo Alto, California that is developing free-electron lasers to manufacture semiconductors. The Commerce Department in December issued a letter of intent to provide xLight with up to $150 million in federal incentives. In exchange, Commerce would receive a $150 million equity stake in xLight.L3HarrisL3Harris Technologies is a defense company with more than $65 billion market cap. It announced a proposed partnership with the U.S. government in December in which the Pentagon would invest $1 billion in its rocket motor business, whose motors are used in missile systems.Under the terms of the investment, L3Harris would launch an initial public offering of its missile business in the second half of 2026, at which point the Pentagon's $1 billion investment would convert into common equity of the spun off division.

    "body": "watch nowPresident Donald Trump's official Truth Social account on Friday morning deleted a video showing a racist image of former President Barack Obama and former first lady Michelle Obama portrayed as apes, following widespread bipartisan calls for its removal.The depiction of the Obamas, posted late Thursday from Trump's official Truth Social account, was included in a video clip pushing a conspiracy theory about voting machines during the 2020 election. The post stayed up for about 12 hours.Trump late Friday during a gaggle with reporters accompanying him aboard Air Force One said that he won't apologize for the post. \"I didn't make a mistake,\" he said.Trump told reporters that he didn't watch the whole video, just the beginning.\"I didn't see the whole thing,\" Trump said. \"I looked at the first part, and it was really about voter fraud in the machines, how ‌crooked ‌it is, how disgusting it is. Then I gave it to the people. Generally, they look at ​the whole thing. But I guess somebody didn't.\"When asked if he condemned the video, he replied, \"Of course I do.\"The White House initially defended Trump's post.A screenshot from a video President Donald Trump posted to his social media platform, Truth Social, on Feb. 5, 2026.

A source familiar with the matter, however, later told CNBC that Trump \"had not seen that video before it was posted.\"\"As soon as he found out, he ordered it taken down,\" the source added.Leavitt's initial reply included a link to a longer video posted Oct. 24 from a pro-Trump meme account on X.In addition to showing the Obamas as apes, the full video shows other animals bearing the faces of prominent Democrats, including former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.(Left to right) U.S. President Donald Trump, first lady Melania Trump, former U.S. President Barack Obama and wife Michelle Obama attend the funeral service for former U.S. President George H.

Mike Lawler, a New York Republican who is considered at risk of losing his seat in the House of Representatives in November's election, also criticized Trump's post.\"The President's post is wrong and incredibly offensive — whether intentional or a mistake — and should be deleted immediately with an apology offered,\" Lawler said on X. The Obama Foundation did not respond to CNBC's request for comment.The video that Trump reposted carried the watermark of an entity calling itself Patriot News Outlet.CNBC reached out to Patriot News Outlet via its email address, requesting comment on the new video, asking who created it and for what purpose, and reaction to the video being removed from Trump's Truth Social feed.In response, the group said, \"We fully unaware of anything that President Trump might have posted including any video claiming to be from Patriot News Outlet.

    "body": "A young woman wearing headphones browses vintage vinyl records in a store.Mihailomilovanovic | E+ | Getty ImagesAccount manager Matt Richards, 23, deleted all his social media apps from his phone last year, and was surprised to find that his life changed for the better. Richards had been using a smartphone since he was 11 years old and grew up with the device like most Gen Z and millennials. However, in the past few years, he noticed social media didn't feel as fun anymore with artificial-intelligence slop dominating his feed, influencers advertising brands, and constant lifestyle comparison.\"I think people back then used to take a break from the real world by going on their phone, but now people are taking a break from their phone to spend time in the real world,\" Richards told CNBC Make It. As many of his Gen Z friends also caught on, he noticed instant benefits, from connecting with people in real life to feeling more confident about himself. Going chronically offline is the latest trend to grip young people, and ironically it's going viral on social media. There's been a surge of TikTok videos of people vowing to delete social media apps in 2026 and engage more with in-person and analog hobbies. When I discovered the trend, I decided to post on LinkedIn to see if there were any young people willing to speak to me about going offline. To my surprise, I received nearly 100 responses from Gen Z and millennials sharing stories about social media detoxes and digital burnout. They talked about ditching their smartphones for flip phones, visiting record stores to buy vinyl, taking up analog hobbies like knitting, and most importantly, connecting with their friends in person. A 2025 Deloitte consumer trends survey of more than 4,000 Brits found that nearly a quarter of all consumers had deleted a social media app in the previous 12 months, rising to nearly a third for Gen Zers. Meanwhile, social media use has steadily declined since time spent on the platforms peaked in 2022, according to an analysis of the online habits of 250,000 adults in more than 50 countries by the Financial Times and digital audience insights firm GWI. Globally, adults 16 and over spent an average of two hours and 20 minutes per day on social platforms by the end of 2024, down almost 10% since 2022, the report found. The decline was particularly pronounced among teens and 20-somethings. Jason Dorsey, president of the Center for Generational Kinetics, said the increased \"nastiness and divisiveness\" online, including from leaders and politicians, is driving young people away from social media as they seek out greater control of their lives. \"We're seeing that a group of Gen Z [and millennials] is choosing to leave social media entirely, and probably a larger group that's choosing just to limit social media as they regain more of what they're trying to find: balance and security and safety in their life,\" Dorsey said. 'Pressure platform' Young people who are deleting their social media platforms cite the increasing pressures of being online as well as damage to their mental health as causes.Deloitte's consumer survey showed that almost a quarter of respondents who deleted social apps reported these apps had negatively impacted their mental health and consumed too much of their time. \"I feel like social media is now more like a pressure platform … you're being sold everything, everywhere,\" Richards said, adding that it influenced his own feelings of not having enough stuff or accomplishing enough in his career. We're definitely seeing a trend where people that are offline, unreachable, have a sort of cool factor around them...this person doesn't need validation.Matt Richards 23-year-old account manager Similarly, 36-year-old entrepreneur Lucy Stace said she's limiting her social media use because it's \"diminishing\" her mental health despite it being essential to her business. \"We are just inundated all of the time with so much information … our brains aren't capable of handling that much information,\" she said. \"We're actually diminishing our brain's capacity to be able to look inward and listen to ourselves, and we're value tagging all of these things that aren't actually important to us.\" Tech giants face \"tremendous pressure\" to monetize everything and drive revenue and profit, said Dorsey, which can be off-putting to younger generations. \"The result of that is that Gen Z, who are already sensitive to being advertised to — they are the most advertised-to generation in the history of the world — now they're getting advertised to even more, and their feeds feel just [like] commercial after commercial,\" Dorsey said. Offline is the new 'cool' As the tide shifts against social media, account manager Richards noted that those who have gone offline have become more interesting. In the past, it was cooler to have lots of followers, but that appeal has faded, Richards noted. \"We're definitely seeing a trend where people that are offline, unreachable, have a sort of cool factor around them, in terms of this person doesn't need validation from how many likes or followers (they have) … and living life like they were in the 80s,\" he said. Social media manager Julianna Salguero, 31, said that social media stopped being cool when politicians and brands started using the platform.\"The more that we see brands and government officials and everybody being as online as you are, as a casual user, the more you're going to want to pull back and switch it,\" Salguero said. As the digital generation struggles to make friends and find partners, they're instead seeking out in-person events like speed dating and professional networking, citing high levels of loneliness and isolation as a key driver. The University of Sheffield's digital media lecturer, Ysabel Gerrard, said going offline is a way for young people to take back control of their lives. Social media forces users to go through an \"extremely exhausting process\" of having to create an identity and edit themselves, she said. \"There's an unbelievable wealth of literature now to tell us that the person we are on social media is not, and cannot be, the same person who we are in face-to-face settings,\" Gerrard said. \"It's so much more than a trend.\" GWI analyst Chris Beer said he believes this is a \"legitimate post-pandemic correction,\" since people are spending less time at home and therefore less time on social media. This shift is \"largely due to structural time allocation,\" he said, especially for younger users, rather than \"an attitude-driven wholesale rejection of digital media.\" Social media is still very integrated into people's lives in areas including shopping, news and education, Beer said.Analog is back In a Substack post in September that got 5,000 likes, Salguero expressed a yearning to have lived life in the '90s when dating apps and doom scrolling weren't a prerequisite of young adulthood. Her article, titled \"How to have an analog fall,\" wasn't about doing digital detoxes or setting timers to limit social media use. Instead, Salguero outlined all the hobbies one could have outside of social media — from going on lunch dates to writing physical letters and opting for tangible media like newspapers. Salguero said going analog is a \"quiet revolution\" against social media, streaming, and content overload. Lacy Stace and her boyfriend's record collection.\"When you spend too much time in that world, it's rewiring your brain to perceive things algorithmically, where I'd rather perceive things as I come across them,\" she said. \"So for me, the going analog of it all isn't necessarily throwing my phone into the ocean, it's more about, 'How do I reset my relationship with it?'\"Indeed, young people are increasingly turning towards physical media as they seek a break from digital life. Some are purchasing vinyl and record players, while others are getting flip phones, a relic of the 2000s. Stace and her boyfriend have started building a record collection and visit record stores when they can, she said.Richards, after deleting all the social media apps off his smartphone, said his conversation with CNBC Make It has motivated him to purchase a \"brick phone\" too, reverting back to the time when phones were primarily used to call people.

    "body": "watch nowCNBC's Jim Cramer on Friday outlined what to watch in Wall Street's week ahead, from key labor data to big earnings reports from McDonald's, Robinhood and others. \"There's a lot going on next week, but the most important thing, believe it or not, is the Labor Department's nonfarm payroll report on Wednesday,\" Cramer said. \"If that comes in soft, it means the Fed can keep cutting rates, and that's great news for the stock market itself.\"Cramer said the recent rallies in decent stocks like PepsiCo, Procter & Gamble and Johnson & Johnson suggests the market believes the U.S. economy is showing signs of weakness. The January jobs report was originally due out Friday morning, but was delayed a few days due to the partial U.S. government shutdown. According to FactSet, economists estimate the U.S. added 80,000 jobs last month.The \"Mad Money\" host then turned his attention to upcoming corporate earnings.CVS Health reports quarterly results on Tuesday morning. Although the stock has been hammered with other health insurers on the Trump administration's proposed reimbursement rates for Medicare Advantage plans, Cramer said it's the only stock in that space he would own. \"CEO David Joyner has done a terrific job and I think it's a fascinating time to own the stock,\" he added. \"They're the last real national drugstore chain now that Walgreens has been taken private.\"Meanwhile, Cramer said DuPont's earnings report that same day should highlight how great of a job CEO Lori Koch has done to improve the chemicals company. DuPont spun off its electronics business into a separate company called Qnity late last year, a long-awaited move that has helped kickstart the stock, which has soared about 58% over the past six months. DuPont is also a holding in Cramer's Charitable Trust, the portfolio managed by the CNBC Investing Club. The Club booked gains on this stock into strength on Thursday. Tuesday also brings results from Robinhood. Cramer said this one has been concerning investors because of how closely its trades with cryptocurrency markets. Shares of Robinhood are down nearly 27% year to date versus the S&P 500's 1.3% gain. McDonald's releases earnings on Wednesday. Cramer described the fast food chain as \"blessed\" because while beef inflation remains an issue, its value proposition has improved for cash-strapped consumers. Finally, Cisco Systems is up to bat after the bell. Shares of the networking company have surged ahead of Wednesday's report, up 10% year to date. \"The stock's been soaring. I don't know. We have to find out if this is a company that's got less software [and] more hardware,\" Cramer said. Cisco is also a holding in Cramer's Charitable Trust. watch now",

    "body": "Engineering majors earn some of the highest salaries right after college — and they're still near the top years later.That's according to the latest findings from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, based on 2024 U.S. Census data, the most recent available.The analysis breaks down annual earnings for college graduates by major and reflects the income of full-time workers whose highest degree is a bachelor's, excluding currently enrolled students. Various engineering degrees have consistently ranked among the top-paying fields in recent years.The highest-paying majors for workers ages 22 to 27 are computer engineering, computer science and chemical engineering, with recent graduates earning median early-career salaries of $85,000 or more. That's well above the U.S  median personal income of just over $45,000, according to U.S. Census Bureau data. However, engineering accounts for about 6% of bachelor's degrees awarded nationwide, representing a relatively small share of all college graduates, according to the most recent data from the National Center for Education Statistics.Here are the 18 majors that lead to the highest salaries for workers ages 22 to 27:Computer engineering: $90,000Computer science: $87,000Chemical engineering: $85,000Aerospace engineering: $85,000Industrial engineering: $83,000Electrical engineering: $82,000Mechanical engineering: $80,000Construction services: $75,000Civil engineering: $75,000General engineering: $75,000Miscellaneous engineering: $75,000Economics: $72,000Business analytics: $72,000Finance: $70,000Mathematics: $70,000Nursing: $70,000Mathematics: $70,000Finance: $70,000Engineering graduates remain in strong demand for their mix of mathematical skills and technical expertise, which are valuable across a wide range of industries, data from the National Association of Colleges and Employers shows.While artificial intelligence is reshaping how the technical work is done, employment in many engineering fields is still projected to grow over the next decade, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.Engineering also tends to pay well over time. Among graduates ages 35 to 45, every engineering major reports median pay of at least $100,000. Here are all of the majors with mid-career median earnings of $100,000 or more, according to the New York Fed.Chemical engineering: $135,000Computer engineering: $131,000Aerospace engineering: $130,000Electrical engineering: $123,000Computer science: $120,000Mechanical engineering: $120,000Construction services: $120,000Civil engineering: $115,000Economics: $115,000Finance: $112,000Business analytics: $109,000General engineering: $105,000Miscellaneous engineering: $105,000Physics: $105,000Engineering technologies: $104,000Industrial engineering: $100,000Mathematics: $100,000Information systems: $100,000Marketing: $100,000Biochemistry: $100,000Political science: $100,000In contrast, education and arts majors tend to earn significantly less overall. By ages 35 to 45, six fields of education majors report median earnings below $60,000, placing them among the lower-paid fields in the study.Want to improve your communication, confidence and success at work?

    "body": "Julia Holden can relate to the struggle of getting your baby to fall asleep.In February 2024, she and her husband noticed that their newborn son Maxime fell asleep more quickly when his eyes were gently covered with a burp cloth or small towel, she says. As a new mom \"in survival mode,\" Holden quickly looked for a purchasable product — a comfortable eye covering that'd stay on his tiny face if he moved — but couldn't find one she liked, she says.As a younger adult, Holden had dreamed of entrepreneurship, so her near-instant thought was to make this product herself and sell it, she says. She designed a baby hat with an attached eye covering, named her side hustle Sleepy Hat and, over the course of the next year, spent nearly $16,000 from her personal savings to bootstrap the business, she says.Since June 2025, the business has brought in five figures in revenue each month, including over $90,000 in December and more than $69,000 in January, according to documents reviewed by CNBC Make It. The company is profitable, says Holden, who initially launched it while working full-time as a senior relationship manager for an advertising company and taking care of her baby.She found time for Sleepy Hat in 20-minute windows between breast-feedings at her home in Lawrence Township, New Jersey, she says. \"I had no outside funding, no team and no child care beyond family help,\" says Holden, 34.DON'T MISS: How to read people and master your body language to be more influential at workHolden quit her job — which paid her $95,000 a year, she says — in October to focus on Sleepy Hat full-time. Most of its profits have been reinvested back into the business, including payroll for two-part-time contractors who help with inventory and running ads on Google and Amazon, she says. \"I also recently took on an advisor, [who has] a little bit of equity,\" Holden says.Holden paid herself $2,500 from the business in 2025, and has been living off her remaining personal savings and her husband's income as an assistant director at Princeton University. She works anywhere from 30 to 60 hours per week, including weekends, she says. Doing all of that while being a mom to a now-2-year-old is taxing, but since she sets her own schedule, she can at least take more time during daylight hours for herself and her family than she did at a 9-to-5, she says.\"I'm still stressed, but for a more meaningful reason,\" says Holden. \"It feels more important. It's much more satisfying.\"'My first sale from a stranger was life-changing'Holden didn't have \"proof of market fit\" when she decided to launch Sleepy Hat, she says. Rather, she brought the idea to other moms in her circle, who she says all called it \"genius.\"She intended to spend about $10,000 launching the business, and surpassed her budget on \"product development, creating patterns, creating prototypes and samples ... and then all the tiny little things that add up, like purchasing a domain, a trademark [and] building a website,\" she says.She didn't have a design background, so the first pattern she and her mom created together resulted in a hat that was \"completely the wrong size,\" she says. An entrepreneur friend referred her to a factory in China, which sent her prototypes. But her \"tech pack\" — a garment blueprint for manufacturers, essentially — initially wasn't detailed enough, resulting in about $1,500 worth of defective products, she says.Before creating the \"Sleepy Hat,\" Holden would use a cloth to limit visual distractions during nap time for her son, Maxime.Julia HoldenAfter finalizing the product's design and ordering 1,500 units, Holden \"splurged\" on a photographer to fill a website for Sleepy Hat with professional-looking images, she says. The website launched in September 2024, and didn't receive many sales until around December, when Holden posted her product and website on online marketplace Grommet, she says.Sleepy Hat ended the year with just under $2,000 in total sales. \"My first sale from a stranger was life-changing,\" says Holden. \"I was so excited but also terrified to actually ship the product.\"Holden joined Amazon as a third-party seller in August 2025. Roughly around then, her posts on Sleepy Hat's TikTok account started gaining traction, with some garnering hundreds of thousands of views and thousands of likes. Moms bonded in the comments over their \"FOMO babies\" who fought sleep while on walks, car rides or in restaurants, saying they \"needed\" the hat for their kids.The road to 'six-figures plus'Most of Holden's sales now come from paid online advertising, she says. She's designing Sleepy Hats with new patterns and materials, improving her social media strategy and updating her packaging, she adds.\"The goal is to increase my own salary on a quarterly basis this year,\" says Holden. \"I hope to double what I pay myself in Q2 in April ... I hope next year to be able to pay myself actually more than what I was making at my full-time job, so six-figures plus.\"Holden isn't technically a first-time entrepreneur — she previously started a short-lived T-shirt brand and website for women runners — but she's still working on her financial acumen and organizational skills, she says. She's worked with an accountant, alongside her advisor, to help her cover that weakness, she says.The original Sleepy Hat sketch Holden came up with in 2024.Julia Holden\"You need to understand every dollar that's coming out and every dollar that's coming in,\" she says. \"And I'm not particularly finite. I just don't gravitate towards spreadsheets ... So it's definitely been a learning curve to force myself to take the time and understand the balance sheet and where every dollar is going, and it's still a work in progress.\"Holden has also learned the value of trusting her gut, she says. She recalls a moment when her sister, who owns a PowerPoint tutorial business, advised against launching a startup as a new mom.\"She was like, 'I would not start a business right now. You're [freshly] postpartum,'\" Holden says. \"And I was like, 'OK, I hear you. I'm going to do it anyway.'\"Want to improve your communication, confidence and success at work? Take CNBC's new online course, Master Your Body Language To Boost Your Influence.

Photo: Yolande CheeYolande CheeIndia hosted one of the world's biggest AI events this week, but it was marred by chaos and confusion, apparently not the message it's trying to send as it strives to become a leading artificial intelligence player.Despite the drama, U.S. tech firms in particular couldn't resist the temptation of the Indian market, talking up the country's AI potential and making a number of announcements.I have been on the ground in New Delhi since Monday and I can honestly say that the AI Impact Summit has been one of the most challenging reporting assignments of my career.Traffic has been a nightmare more than usual in the Indian capital. There were times it didn't move at all. On Wednesday, I had events and interviews at three different hotels and getting the team around to these appointments on time was a real challenge.India hosted one of the biggest AI events in the world that was marred by some chaos and confusion. Photo: AI Impact Summit 2026Arjun KharpalAt one point on Thursday, were weren't even sure if we'd be able to enter the Bharat Mandapam, the venue where the summit took place. That's because instructions were not clear on when media would be allowed in on Thursday when Prime Minister Narendra Modi inaugurated the event.We eventually found out we could enter at 6 a.m. local time. When we turned up, security did not let us in until later, not before a crowd of media had gathered at the gates. Inside, security were giving out conflicting instructions. Several delegates expressed to me their frustrations over the organization of the summit. The event itself was marred by other controversies. Bill Gates, who was named in the Epstein files, was scheduled to give a keynote address. There was then uncertainty if he would even turn up. The Gates Foundation had said earlier in the week that he would give the speech, but then on Thursday said the billionaire had pulled out.Meanwhile, a university was reportedly kicked out of the summit for suggesting a robot dog they were showcasing was its own creation. A professor at Galgotias University told state-run broadcaster DD News that the robot, which was actually made by Chinese firm Unitree, was \"developed\" by the academic institution.India hosted one of the biggest AI events in the world that was marred by some chaos and confusion. Photo: AI Impact Summit 2026Arjun KharpalOnline users called out the university, highlighting that the robot was made by a Chinese firm. The university denied claiming it had built the robot.\"We would like to clearly state that the robotic programming is part of our endeavor to make students learn AI programming and develop and deploy real-world skills using globally available tools and resources, given developing AI talent is [the] need of the hour,\" the university said, according to media reports.Indian IT minister Ashwini Vaishnaw apologized on Tuesday for the \"problems\" on day one.

Modi had delegates on stage with everyone holding hands. But OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei didn't do as they they'd been instructed, in a moment that instantly got scrutinized across social media. Altman later explained that he was \"confused\" and wasn't sure what he should be doing.Days earlier, Anthropic ran a Super Bowl ad taking digs at OpenAI's decision to test advertisements in ChatGPT. India's lureDespite all of these moments, the event pulled in a who's who of tech names from Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai to Altman, all of whom talked up India's advantages from a huge talent pool to a large consumer market. \"The excitement here, it's just been incredible to watch,\" Altman told me. These tech firms used the week to make announcements and form partnerships around India. OpenAI said it would be the first customer of Tata Consultancy Services' data center business. Google announced partnerships with researchers and education institutions for its Gemini artificial intelligence feature.Read moreEvery CEO I spoke to praised India's tech development and focus. The government used the opportunity to tout India's potential as an AI hub saying the country was aiming to attract $200 billion in AI investment over the next two years.Even the blaring horns of the cars of New Delhi and the chaos of the Summit weren't enough to dampen the enthusiasm from big tech for India which continues to grow as a critical and attractive market for some of the world's largest firms.",

Saul Loeb | Afp | Getty ImagesAirlines canceled more than 5,000 flights through Monday and waived cancellation and change fees for airports spanning Virginia to Maine ahead of another massive winter storm on the East Coast, set to once again put carriers to the test at the tail-end of winter break.The National Weather Service issued a blizzard warning for much of New Jersey, the New York City area, and parts of Maryland, Connecticut, Rhode Island and Massachusetts. The storm could dump more than 2 feet of snow in some areas as well as bring wind gusts of more than 40 miles per hour. The NWS warned that travel will be trecherous with low visibility.About two-thirds of the flights to New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport and LaGuardia Airport were canceled on Sunday as were around 40% of the departures, according to FlightAware. Disruptions are set to worsen on Monday with snow continuining to fall. More than 70% of Monday departures were canceled at Boston Logan International Airport.Airlines routinely cancel flights ahead of major storms to avoid having aircraft and crews out of place and to make it easier to restart operations after the storm passes.Delta Air Lines, American Airlines, JetBlue Airways, United Airlines and Spirit Airlines waived fees and fare differences for passengers if they can travel as late as Feb. 26.

Nathan Posner | Anadolu | Getty ImagesCongressional Democrats rejoiced on Friday and Republicans remained divided in the wake of a momentous Supreme Court decision striking down a large portion of President Donald Trump's tariff agenda.\"Trump's chaotic and illegal tariff tax made life more expensive and our economy more unstable. Families paid more. Small businesses and farmers got squeezed. Markets swung wildly,\" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said in a statement after the decision. \"We've said from day one: a president cannot ignore Congress and unilaterally slap tariffs on Americans. That overreach failed.\"The ruling is a major hit to Trump, who used a novel reading of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, or IEEPA, to slap a barrage of tariffs on American trading partners. Tariffs and the economy more broadly will be a key messaging issue for Democrats on the campaign trail for this year's midterm elections. Primaries start next month leading up to the November general election.The Supreme Court decision sets up additional potential showdowns in Congress over how to handle Trump's trade war after the U.S. House voted last week to overturn tariffs on Canada.Read more CNBC coverage on tariffsSupreme Court strikes down Trump tariffs in rebuke of signature policyTrump announces 10% global tariff after raging over Supreme Court lossTrump tariffs: U.S. could owe $175 billion in refundsWhat the Supreme Court tariff ruling may mean for your moneySmall furniture retailers face existential tariff threat, despite Supreme Court rulingU.S. trade deficit totaled $901 billion in 2025, barely budging despite Trump’s tariffsFor Republicans, Trump's tariffs, which have proven largely unpopular in a pivotal election year, are a more complicated issue.\"SCOTUS's outrageous ruling handcuffs our fight against unfair trade that has devastated American workers for decades. These tariffs protected jobs, revived manufacturing, and forced cheaters like China to pay up,\" Sen. Bernie Moreno, R-Ohio, posted to X. \"This betrayal must be reversed and Republicans must get to work immediately on a reconciliation bill to codify the tariffs that had made our country the hottest country on earth!\" Moreno continued.Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., who has voted with Democrats in opposition to Trump's tariffs, celebrated the decision. He and other opponents of the trade policy have argued that it is Congress, not the president, that has the constitutional authority to enact taxes and tariffs.\"In defense of our Republic, the Supreme Court struck down using emergency powers to enact taxes,\"  Paul posted on X. \"This ruling will also prevent a future President such as AOC from using emergency powers to enact socialism.\"The court ruled a little over a week after a small group of House Republicans joined most of their Democratic colleagues to overturn Trump's 35% tariff of Canada, though the resolution was largely symbolic since it would require approval from the Senate and the White House to take effect.Rep. Don Bacon, R-Neb., one of the six Republicans who voted to overturn the tariffs, called the decision \"a common-sense and straightforward ruling by the Supreme Court.\"\"The Constitution's checks and balances still work. Article One gives tariff authority to Congress,\" Bacon wrote on X. \"In the future, Congress should defend its own authorities and not rely on the Supreme Court.\"Some Democrats suggested Trump would look for other mechanism to impose tariffs, while some Republicans said that he should do so.\"Good news today. The Supreme Court has struck down many of Trump's tariffs. Sadly, this President is absolutely dedicated to making you pay these taxes. He's going to try other ways to keep them in place,\" Sen. Raphael Warnock, D-Ga., said in a post to X. \"I will continue voting to block Trump's reckless tariffs in the Senate.\"In the House, Rep. Steven Horsford, D-Nev., touted his legislation, dubbed the RELIEF Act, that would trigger tariff refunds to small businesses.\"These taxes stole money from working families and small businesses who were forced to pay them from the very beginning. Now, it's time to start repairing the economic damage these Trump taxes have caused,\" Horsford posted to X.The legislation is symbolic because its success would require significant Republican buy-in in the GOP-controlled House and Senate. And many allies of Trump suggested the Supreme Court decision would not be the end of the president's tariff agenda.",

    "body": "U.S. growth slowed more than expected near the end of 2025 as the government shutdown impacted spending and investment, while a key inflation metric showed high prices are still a factor for the economy, according to data released Friday.Gross domestic product rose at an annualized rate of just 1.4%, according to the Commerce Department, well below the Dow Jones estimate for a 2.5% gain. Consumer spending increased at a slower pace for the period while government spending tumbled sharply in a quarter marked by the record-length shutdown. The department estimated that the shutdown subtracted about 1 percentage point from growth, though it added that the exact impacts \"cannot be quantified.\"For the full year in 2025, the U.S. economy grew at a 2.2% pace, down from the 2.8% increase in 2024. \"The Federal government shutdown clearly sent the economy careening off its strong growth path in the fourth quarter which is a one-off that won't be repeated in early 2026,\" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at Fwdbonds.Just before the data release, President Donald Trump warned that the GDP number would be soft, blaming it on the government shutdown that ended in November.\"The Democrat Shutdown cost the U.S.A. at least two points in GDP. That's why they are doing it, in mini form, again. No Shutdowns!\" Trump said in a Truth Social post. \"Also, LOWER INTEREST RATES. 'Two Late' Powell is the WORST!!!\"The latter part of the post was a reference to Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, whom Trump has repeatedly criticized for not lowering rates more aggressively.While growth slowed, inflation held firm in December, according to the gauge most closely watched by Fed officials.The core personal consumption expenditures price index, which excludes food and energy, rose 3% in December, up 0.2 percentage point from November, according to a separate release. That matched the consensus forecast but kept the pivotal inflation measure well above the Fed's 2% target.On a headline basis, the PCE index accelerated 2.9%, or 0.1 percentage point higher than expected. Both indexes rose 0.4% for the month, compared with the respective forecasts for 0.3%.On a monthly basis, goods prices climbed 0.4% while services increased 0.3%, indicating that price pressures remained relatively broad-based rather than concentrated in any single category. Fed policymakers have been watching that balance closely to see whether inflation is being spurred by temporary tariff-related pressures that would hit goods, or more fundamental demand-driven factors that would show up in services.The Fed cut its benchmark rate by three-quarters of a percentage point in late 2025 but has since signaled a more cautious approach as officials assess progress on inflation alongside risks to the labor market.While Trump blamed the shutdown, the Commerce Department said the deceleration in GDP, which grew at a 4.4% rate in the third quarter, was the result in a pullback in consumer spending and exports, as well as the impact from the government closure that ran from Oct. 1 to Nov. 12.\"The government shutdown hurt growth at the end of 2025. The economy will likely bounce back in early 2026, but it isn't harmless to do prolonged shutdowns,\" said Heather Long, chief economist at Navy Federal Credit Union. \"Overall, the U.S. economy was resilient in 2025 despite many headwinds. Solid consumption and the AI boom kept the economy growing.\"Personal consumption expenditures, a proxy for consumer outlays, rose 2.4% in the quarter, down from the 3.5% gain in the prior period. Exports fell 0.9% after surging 9.6% in Q3.Though the headline GDP number looked weak, underlying signs of demand were strong.Another key Fed metric, called final sales to private domestic purchasers, posted a 2.4% increase for the quarter, half a percentage point lower than the prior quarter but still indicative of solid underlying demand in the $31.5 trillion U.S. economy.Also, gross private domestic investment rose 3.8% after being flat in Q3.On the downside, government spending and investment slid 5.1%, slammed by a 16.6% tumble at the federal level that was only partially offset by a 2.4% increase from state and local entities. Correction: Final sales to private domestic purchasers posted a 2.4% increase for the quarter, half a percentage point lower than the prior quarter. An earlier version misstated a time element.",

US CENTCOM | Anadolu | Getty ImagesPresident Donald Trump said Friday that he is considering limited military strikes to pressure Iran over its nuclear program. \"I guess I can say I am considering that,\" Trump said when asked by a reporter at a White House breakfast with U.S. governors. Trump said Thursday that he would make a decision in the next 10 to 15 days on whether to attack the Islamic Republic. He has left open the possibility that a deal could still be reached with Tehran over its nuclear program. Trump has previously said an attack on Iran would be \"far worse\" than the limited strikes launched by the U.S. in June against its nuclear facilities.Oil prices were stable Friday after rallying more than 5% this week as traders price in some risk of imminent U.S. military action. U.S. crude oil fell 4 cents to close at $66.39 per barrel. Global benchmark Brent rose 10 cents to settle at $71.76 per barrel.A massive U.S. military buildup is underway in the Middle East. The USS Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier is in the region. A second aircraft carrier, the USS Gerald Ford, is en route. The oil market's biggest fear is that a conflict between the U.S. and Iran could lead to a prolonged disruption of oil flows through the Strait of Hormuz. The strait is a vital chokepoint for the global oil trade. More than 14 million barrels per day of oil and condensates passed through the narrow waterway on average in 2025, according to data from consulting firm Kpler, which says that amount accounts for a third of total worldwide seaborne oil exports.About three-quarters of the oil that passes through the strait goes to China, India, Japan and South Korea, according to Kpler.watch now",

    "body": "People are nostalgic for a simpler time without smartphones, social media and AI. Cat Goetze is dialed in. The 29-year-old in Los Angeles is the founder of Physical Phones, a Bluetooth-enabled landline phone business that's taken off in recent months.In 2025, her business brought in over $789,000 in sales, according to documents reviewed by CNBC Make It.But like all \"overnight\" success stories, Goetze has been working at it for a while now.Call waitingGoetze says she first had the idea for a landline-style phone product in 2023 after spending the better part of the pandemic trying to reduce her screentime. She daydreamed about her childhood sharing a landline with her family.Cat Goetze is the founder of Physical Phones, a Bluetooth-enabled landline style phone.Tristan Pelletier | CNBC Make It\"When I grew up, there was this booklet that the school sent out to all of the families in the school district that literally had all of the students' names and their home phone numbers,\" Goetze says. \"I distinctly remember prank calling some of the other people in the school using that phone book.\"But when she looked into what it would take to actually install a landline in her home, including getting a new phone number and paying the $80 monthly service she was quoted, she set out to find a different way.As a creator, your job is really to kind of hold an antenna out into the zeitgeist and pick up on what people want creatively, spiritually, emotionally.Cat Goetzefounder of Physical Phones\"With my technical background, I thought to myself, it probably wouldn't be that difficult to just hook up a landline phone to my smartphone,\" says Goetze, who pursued an interdisciplinary major in science, technology and society at Stanford. \"Then I started tinkering around and prototyping and figuring out a way to build that.\"In 2023, Goetze built a prototype of her first phone, a pink handset, and posted it to TikTok. At the time, she didn't have much of a social media audience, and the post got no traction or sales.\"I was like, OK , whatever, that's fine. This was like a fun project,\" she says. \"I wasn't really trying to make money off of it anyways.\"Two years later, in 2025, she'd gained a following for her online brand, CatGPT, where she discusses AI and digital wellness. She was also noticing more people talking about wanting to reduce their smartphone dependence. It reminded her of her landline phone prototype, so she posted about it again.That video from July 2025 went viral, getting over 8 million views across Instagram and TikTok. The product, officially branded Physical Phones, passed $120,000 in sales in its first three days.\"As a creator, your job is really to kind of hold an antenna out into the zeitgeist and pick up on what people want creatively, spiritually, emotionally,\" she says. When she revisited the idea at just the right moment, \"it took off.\"Christina Locopo | CNBC Make ItDialing up the businessPhysical Phones are battery-powered and connect to a smartphone via Bluetooth.Once connected, the landline acts just like your cellphone. If your phone rings, the landline will too, and you can carry out your call from the handset. To make an outbound call, you can use the landline set to directly dial the number.For most of us who no longer memorize phone numbers, you can also pick up the handset and dial star (*) to activate the voice assistant on your phone, like Siri, where you can direct it to dial a certain contact.The Physical Phone also works with audio calls from FaceTime and Whatsapp.Pre-orders for Physical Phones opened in July 2025 and fully funded the first round of production, covering things like warehousing, shipping, printing, hiring and \"everything else that we needed to actually get the business off the ground,\" Goetze says. Physical Phones currently sells three styles of phones — a handset, a wall mount and a rotary version — that range in price from $90 to $110.Tristan Pelletier | CNBC Make ItThe business sources phones from a manufacturer in Asia, meaning it also lost a \"whopping portion\" of profits due to tariffs under the Trump administration's new policy, Goetze says.Goetze says working with a manufacturer was the hardest part of the process of launching Physical Phones because she'd never done it before and, as she learned, it can be time-intensive.\"It's pretty draining, honestly, because what I underestimated before building Physical Phones was just how every single detail gets pored over for a hardware product,\" she says. It took two to three months to finalize the first Physical Phone, she adds.Goetze says her goal with the first round of orders was to deliver them to customers by December 2025 in time for Christmas.Shipping everything by cargo boat would have taken too long, Goetze says. The only way for them to meet their goal was to fly all the phones from the manufacturer in Asia to their warehouse in California by cargo plane.The endeavor cost the company nearly $74,000, which covered the international freight charge; customs entry fee; and delivery, service and administrative expenses.\"It was a huge hit to our profit margin,\" Goetze says. \"But I also think that it's those kinds of decisions where you really stand up for your customer and you show them how much you care.\"Cat Goetze posted a call for pre-orders of Physical Phones in July 2025. The business passed $120,000 in sales within three days.Tristan Pelletier | CNBC Make ItOnce they got all the phones to their warehouse, Goetze says she and her team \"called in every single friend, family member, colleague, neighbor that I knew and basically asked anybody with a pair of hands to come to the warehouse and help us break down and ship all of these phones within 24 hours.\"Goetze says she and her team prepared 4,000 orders for delivery across the U.S. in December 2025.Ringing off the hookPhysical Phones currently sells three styles of phones, including a handset, wall mount and rotary phone, which range in price from $90 to $110. To date, Goetze says the business has sold over 7,500 devices.Physical Phones made about $439,000 in profit in 2025, which Goetze says she reinvests back into the business for research and development for new models, and to hire for her small team of four.Christina Locopo | CNBC Make ItGoetze doesn't take a salary from Physical Phones and supports herself with earnings from her CatGPT media business, which includes branded content and content partnerships.She recently hired a CEO, Josh Silverman, who was brought on during the first round of production and now runs the business day-to-day. Looking ahead, 2026 is all about growing Physical Phones through potentially selling to retail, Goetze says.Cat Goetze is soon launching Cat Labs, a creator-first product studio where she plans to build new products, apps, websites and services.Tristan Pelletier | CNBC Make It\"One of the main questions that we're toying with right now is: Do we want to continue to have this sort of drop model where we ship out large quantities of inventory at a time, or do we want to have more of a traditional e-commerce or evergreen model where we have stock consistently?\" she says. \"There's pros and cons to each.\"Goetze is soon launching Cat Labs, a creator-first product studio where she plans to build new      products, apps, websites and services.\"As a creator-founder,\" Goetze says, \"my zone of genius, if you will, comes from my ability to stick that cultural antenna up into the air and understand what my audience wants, and being able to predict and build what they want next.\"Want to improve your communication, confidence and success at work?

    "body": "The Supreme Court during a rain storm in Washington, Feb. 20, 2026.Annabelle Gordon | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesThe Supreme Court on Friday ruled that President Donald Trump's country-specific \"reciprocal\" tariffs are unconstitutional, delivering a win for many consumer companies facing higher import costs.But the ruling doesn't cover all sectors. The Supreme Court reviewed tariffs enacted under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977, or IEEPA, which the Trump administration used to justify the sweeping tariff agenda. The act had never before been used by a president to impose tariffs.In a 6-3 decision, the Supreme Court ruled that IEEPA \"does not authorize the President to impose tariffs.\" Still, hours after the ruling, Trump announced a new global 10% tariff, and the Supreme Court's ruling does not cover tariffs enacted under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962. Those duties are intended to target specific products that threaten national security, and they remain in effect after Friday's ruling. Separate from his country-specific rates, Trump has raised tariffs on imports of steel, semiconductors, aluminum and other products deemed to impair national security. Here are the sectors still facing higher levies even after the Supreme Court decision.AutosIt's not immediately clear how much the decision will impact the U.S. and global automotive industry. The industry continues to face billions of dollars in tariff costs, depending on where an imported auto part or vehicle originates.The Trump administration last year broadly implemented 25% tariffs on vehicles and certain auto parts imported into the U.S., citing national security risks. It has since struck independent deals to lower the levies to 10% to 15% with countries such as the United Kingdom and Japan. Others, such as South Korea, have also struck deals for lower rates, but it's unclear if those changes have actually taken effect.\"With today's decision out and subsequent developments, there remain many unknowns and important questions still to be answered. This is not a moment to ease up,\" said Lenny LaRocca, U.S. automotive lead for consulting firm KPMG. \"Automakers should continue planning for multiple scenarios and keep supply chain considerations top of mind as the trade and tariff landscape continues to evolve.\"America's largest automaker, General Motors, last month said it expects between $3 billion and $4 billion in tariff costs this year, and Ford Motor earlier this month said its net tariff impact is expected to be roughly flat year over year at $2 billion in 2026.Ford told CNBC in a statement that it is continuing to work with the government on policies that \"promote a strong and globally competitive U.S. auto sector.\" GM did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the Supreme Court decision.PharmaceuticalsThe pharmaceutical industry is facing a lot of uncertainty over tariffs. Trump has repeatedly threatened tariffs on pharmaceutical imports, though they haven't yet taken effect, in part because of negotiated multiyear deals between the administration and drugmakers. If that were to change, however, pharmaceutical tariffs would still be covered under Section 232.The administration has floated imposing tariffs on the industry that could eventually reach up to 250%. Last July, Trump threatened 200% tariffs on pharmaceuticals, and the administration has already opened a Section 232 investigation into pharmaceuticals to investigate the impact of imports on national security.The tariff threats are a move to push drug companies to manufacture in the U.S. instead of abroad. In December, multiple companies inked a deal with Trump to voluntarily lower their prices in exchange for a three-year exemption from any pharma tariffs — as long as they invest further in U.S. manufacturing. That deal included major players like Merck, Bristol Myers Squibb, Novartis and more. FurnitureThe furniture industry found little relief from Friday's Supreme Court ruling.Last fall, items like couches, kitchen cabinets, vanities and more were hit with higher tariffs under Section 232. The roughly 25% duties will remain in place even now that the IEEPA tariffs have been deemed unconstitutional. The furniture industry is already facing greater uncertainty, with the 25% tariff expected to rise to 50% in 2027, and more broad pressures from higher interest rates and inflation. Smaller companies are getting hit the hardest, with fewer resources to work with, while larger companies are facing bankruptcy, like Value City Furniture's parent company, American Signature Furniture, which went out of business late last year.Food and consumer packaged goodsUnder Section 232, steel and aluminum imports into the U.S. are still carry tariffs. With higher aluminum tariffs, companies like Coca-Cola, PepsiCo, Keurig Dr Pepper and Reynolds will continue to face higher costs associated with manufacturing their products.Trump hiked aluminum tariffs to 50% last year.Still, some of the key tariffs for the sector have been rolled back, even before Friday's ruling.In November, Trump issued an executive order exempting several hundred agricultural products, including bananas, coffee and spices, from tariffs. And in September, he similarly rescinded a 10% tariff on Brazilian pulp, a key component of paper towels, diapers and toilet paper.— CNBC's Mike Wayland, Annika Kim Constantino, Gabrielle Fonrouge and Amelia Lucas contributed to this report.",

    "body": "watch nowThe retail industry on Friday said the Supreme Court's ruling that struck down some of President Donald Trump's global tariffs would usher in more predictability and free up businesses from the burden of higher import costs. \"The Supreme Court's announcement today regarding tariffs provides much-needed certainty for U.S. businesses and manufacturers, enabling global supply chains to operate without ambiguity,\" the National Retail Federation said in a statement following the ruling. \"Clear and consistent trade policy is essential for economic growth, creating jobs and opportunities for American families.\"The nation's highest court determined that Trump's broad tariff rates on U.S. trade partners enacted under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, or IEEPA, overstepped the president's authority. The Supreme Court is sending the case back to the lower court for dismissal.Yet the reversal has raised fresh questions about whether retailers and U.S. consumers will meaningfully feel a financial impact and if the decision means more uncertainty or less.Just hours after the ruling was handed down, Trump condemned the ruling and said his administration has \"alternatives,\" referencing sector-specific tariffs and announcing a new, global tariff rate of 10%. It's also unclear if, when and how the government may refund tariffs that have already been paid and were deemed unconstitutional. \"We urge the lower court to ensure a seamless process to refund the tariffs to U.S. importers,\" the NRF said in its statement. \"The refunds will serve as an economic boost and allow companies to reinvest in their operations, their employees and their customers.\"The NRF represents a number of U.S. retailers, from big-box retailers such as Walmart to smaller brands and manufacturers. In an interview with CNBC on Friday afternoon, David French, executive vice president of government relations for NRF, acknowledged that retailers continue to face other tariffs and may face new ones, based on Trump's remarks. \"The president has lots of other tariff tools in the toolbox ,and we certainly expect he will use these tools to advance his tariff agenda and maintain leverage in negotiations with other countries,\" he said. \"The good thing about the ruling today is it takes one of the tools away from him and will build a little bit more of certainty into the tariff process.\"Compared with Trump's broad use of IEEPA, alternative tariffs that the president imposed on Friday \"have inherit limitations,\" French said. Some of those tariffs would come with time limits or require the administration to clear additional hurdles. And, he said, if companies get a refund of tariffs they paid, they could put it toward investing in their businesses, hiring more workers or lowering prices. He said the trade group is \"hopeful the president comes to the conclusion that getting the refunds out as quickly and as simply as possible would be in everybody's best interest\" — noting it could also help Trump ahead of the midterm elections.In December, warehouse club Costco sued the Trump administration to get a full refund of the tariffs it had paid and to block import duties from continuing. In the lawsuit, filed in the U.S. Court of International Trade, Costco said it risked losing money it has already paid even if the Supreme Court ruled against the tariffs. Costco did not respond to a request for comment about the Supreme Court decision and what it means for the retailer's lawsuit. While Friday's ruling is largely positive for the retail industry, the idea that it brings more predictability and lower costs is likely \"a pipe dream,\" said Steven Shemesh, a retail analyst for RBC Capital Markets. \"This administration is pretty adamant about tariffs and trade balance, and if it doesn't come this way, I'm pretty certain it will come in another way,\" he said prior to Trump's announcement of new tariffs. \"It may have another look, shape, size, smell, but I think it will end up looking similar.\"Apparel and footwear Clothing, footwear and discretionary items were among the imports most vulnerable to Trump's tariffs, which imposed steep rates on countries such as China and Vietnam, where the retail industry maintains large portions of its supply chain. Footwear has been one of the most heavily affected industries, since nearly 100% of all footwear sold in the U.S. is imported, according to Footwear Distributors and Retailers of America, the industry's trade group.Even before Trump's first term, footwear manufacturers were moving some sourcing out of China as its labor force shrank, said Matt Priest, CEO of the FDRA. Yet it would be unrealistic to return production to the U.S., he said, and moving it to another part of Asia can be difficult.In an interview with CNBC on Friday, Priest said the decision is a step toward more predictability for the footwear industry because it limits tariffs that Trump can use to ones that \"are not as sweeping\" and may require Congress' input. \"Even if it's still uncertain to some degree, we are not on that playing field where we have those exorbitant tariffs,\" he said.The trade group, which includes well-known footwear companies and brands such as Nike, Crocs and Puma, held an emergency videoconference with 325 companies Friday afternoon. Priest said trade group members were upbeat but also had a lot of questions. Among them, members asked about when or if they would get refunds and when the IEEPA tariffs would officially be stopped, specifically whether they would still hit shipments that arrive in the coming days. Priest said he doesn't anticipate that refunds will come quickly and that the trade group has coached members against banking on them. He said the group's work continues, as it tries to work with the Trump administration and Congress to nudge them toward \"a more surgical, thoughtful approach\" to tariffs. On the call with trade group members, Priest said, \"There was optimism that this part of this journey was at least somewhat being redirected,\" and he described the ruling as \"a win\" for the industry. But, he added, without the refund and other details spelled out yet, \"it's a long way to go.\"",

The artificial intelligence company is providing a lower number and more defined timeline for its planned spending, sources told CNBC, as broader concerns mounted that expansion ambitions were too great for the potential revenue that would follow.OpenAI is projecting that its total revenue for 2030 will be more than $280 billion, with nearly equal contributions from its consumer and enterprise businesses, said the sources, who asked not to be named because the information is private. The spending plan the company is offering is meant to more directly tie to its expected revenue growth, the people said. In the back half of last year, OpenAI announced a flurry of multibillion-dollar infrastructure deals, partnering with leading chipmakers and cloud companies. OpenAI is finalizing a massive funding round that could total more than $100 billion, with about 90% coming from strategic investors, one person said. Nvidia is in discussions to invest up to $30 billion in OpenAI as part of the round that could value the company at a $730 billion pre-money valuation, CNBC has confirmed.In addition to Nvidia, strategic investors in the funding include SoftBank and Amazon. OpenAI generated $13.1 billion in revenue in 2025, the sources said, up from its $10 billion target. The company burned through $8 billion, lower than its $9 billion target, they said. The startup was founded as a nonprofit research lab in 2015, and it rocketed into the mainstream following the launch of its chatbot ChatGPT in 2022. ChatGPT now supports more than 900 million weekly active users, the people said, up from 800 million as of October. OpenAI declared a \"code red\" in December to focus on improving the chatbot in the face of competition from rivals Google and Anthropic. ChatGPT had a dip in growth in the fall, but is back to record highs in both weekly active and daily active users, the people said.The company's coding product, Codex, has surpassed more than 1.5 million weekly active users, the people said. Codex competes directly with Anthropic's Claude Code, which has seen a wave of adoption over the last year.WATCH: Watch CNBC’s full interview with OpenAI CEO Sam Altmanwatch now",

Chip Somodevilla | Getty ImagesForty minutes before the federal government revealed that economic growth slowed sharply in the last quarter, President Donald Trump dropped a hint that the incoming data would be weaker.\"The Democrat Shutdown cost the U.S.A. at least two points in GDP. That's why they are doing it, in mini form, again,\" Trump wrote in a Truth Social post at 7:50 a.m. ET.At 8:30 a.m., the Commerce Department reported that U.S. gross domestic product rose at an annualized rate of just 1.4% in the fourth quarter of 2025. That's a decline of 3 percentage points from the previous three-month period. Trump's Friday morning post referred to last year's record-length government shutdown, which began Oct. 1 — the start of the fourth quarter — and lasted 43 days.The federal funding lapse was expected to take a toll on GDP. The U.S. Congressional Budget Office estimated that, depending on its length, the shutdown would shrink annualized real GDP growth in Q4 by up to 2 percentage points.But economists from Dow Jones were still estimating a 2.5% gain for the period.Trump has previously revealed economic data before its official release, raising questions about possible policy violations and concerns that traders may be getting a heads-up from the president, who can be briefed on the data before it comes out. The Office of Management and Budget not only prohibits executive branch officials from commenting early on such releases, but forbids public statements about them until 30 minutes after they have come out.A White House official defended Trump's post, telling CNBC on condition of anonymity that the president has consistently pointed out how the shutdown has been a drag on the economy, including by sharing GDP percentage figures \"consistent with his 2% Truth this morning.\"In a Truth Social post in January, Trump indirectly revealed forthcoming nonfarm payrolls data.The White House at the time admitted that there was an \"inadvertent public disclosure of aggregate data\" while attacking the media for \"grasping at straws to foment another fake controversy.\"During his first presidential term, Trump signaled optimism about a blowout jobs report shortly before its release.Trump's post Friday morning also reiterated his long-running criticism of Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell over his refusal to lower interest rates as sharply or quickly as the president wants.\"Also, LOWER INTEREST RATES. 'Two Late' Powell is the WORST!!!\" Trump wrote.He has previously branded Powell with the derisive nickname \"Too Late\"; it was unclear if the president meant to misspell the nickname in Friday's post.The White House did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment on Trump's social media post.watch now",

    "body": "watch nowParked along industrial streets, tucked behind warehouses and clustered in residential neighborhoods, thousands of Bay Area residents are living in one of the only forms of housing they can afford: RVs.Across California, the number of people living in vehicles has surged in recent years, as soaring rents and a chronic housing shortage have pushed even full-time workers out of traditional homes and into makeshift ones on wheels. Booming tech wealth, soaring homelessnessIn Santa Clara County — home to Apple, Google and eight of America's 50 most expensive ZIP codes — the number of people living in recreational vehicles full time has surged. County data shows that the portion of homeless individuals sleeping in vehicles has more than doubled since the pandemic, from 18% in 2019 to 37% in 2025. California accounts for nearly a quarter of the nation's homeless residents, despite being home to 12% of its total population, according to federal housing data. Experts say the state faces a massive housing shortage, with one estimate by McKinsey suggesting California needs as many as 3.5 million more homes to meet demand. And even as officials have expanded shelter capacity, federal data shows far fewer shelter beds available than people experiencing homelessness, leaving a significant share of unhoused residents without adequate access to shelter.\"In California, you're more likely to become homeless than almost any other state,\" said Adrian Covert, senior vice president of public policy for the Bay Area Council, a nonpartisan think tank. \"And when you do, you're more likely to become homeless on the streets rather than in the shelter than almost any other state.\"Why RVs?Advocates say many people turn to RVs because they offer a degree of autonomy that shelters and the street do not.\"The RV was a lot better,\" said Salena Alvarez, who has lived in an RV with her boyfriend for a year and a half. Before living in their RV, the couple lived in a car. \"The car is smaller … you can't cook, you can't wash your dishes, you can't take a shower, you can't go to the bathroom. You've got to go somewhere.\"Salena Alvarez is a resident at the Berryessa Supportive Parking site in San Jose, California. She's lived in an RV for a year and a half.CNBCThe RV was a lot better. The car is smaller ... you can't cook, you can't wash your dishes, you can't take a shower, you can't go to the bathroom. You've got to go somewhere.Salena AlvarezRV residentThe rise of 'vanlords'As housing options narrow, a new tier of the crisis has emerged — one where even vehicles have become rental properties.A shadow rental market has taken hold across the Bay Area, where individuals rent out aging RVs to people with few other options. Some call them \"vanlords.\"Renters pay hundreds of dollars per month to sleep in a vehicle parked on a public street. The arrangements typically come without written leases or tenant protections.CNBC spoke with one vanlord and several tenants. Some tenants were immigrants, newly arrived in the U.S., including one woman and her two children from Mexico, while others said the option was simply more affordable than traditional apartment housing in the Bay Area. One individual told CNBC he'd been living in an RV on the street in San Francisco for about a year, splitting it with a friend for a total of $500 a month. They rent from the owner of a stretch of vehicles on the same block, calling it \"safe and comfortable,\" adding that $1,000 to rent a room in an apartment was too expensive.But lawmakers see the arrangements as exploitative.\"These are folks who are using our public streets for revenue, to make money without any kind of permitting or process to make sure that they're following any rules about what conditions the RVs have to be in, or what rights the person has who rents has,\" said David Cohen, a city councilmember in San Jose, who sponsored legislation to ban the practice. \"We're trying to protect our community as well as protect the people who are unhoused.\"But cracking down on vanlords has been difficult, and the underground market persists.Meanwhile, cities across the Bay Area have ramped up parking enforcement, issuing citations and towing vehicles as RV encampments have become more visible.Yet neither approach — banning vanlords nor cracking down on parking — has reversed the growth of vehicle homelessness.That's left officials searching for alternatives.A different approachIn an industrial corner of San Jose, just off the freeway and nestled between a recycling plant and a concrete distributor, the city of San Jose has converted an empty parking lot into what it calls a \"safe parking site.\"Operated by a local nonprofit and funded by a grant from the city, the Berryessa Safe Parking Site has space for 86 RVs, making it one of the largest sites of its kind in California, according to WeHope, the homelessness organization that operates it. The park opened in 2025, and organizers say it consistently has a full waiting list. Alvarez, a full-time in-home care worker, is one of its residents.In the center of the 6-acre lot sits a bank of showers, laundry machines and an office, where case workers meet with residents to help them find housing. Engaging with the system – working to move out of RVs and into traditional housing – is a requirement to live at the park. The city expects the site will cost $24 million over a five-year period, including the cost of the services it provides.The site's manager, Victoria Garibaldi, said she and her team have placed upward of 40 people in housing since the site opened. Victoria Garibaldi, a program manager with WeHOPE, oversees the city’s safe-parking site. She says the program has helped more than 40 residents secure permanent housing.CNBC\"We want them to have their own places. This isn't a permanent solution to the housing problem,\" she said. The park is San Jose's second safe parking site. Despite its success, the need far outweighs the supply. San Jose has 128 spots like these across two safe parking sites, but estimates that nearly 1,000 people live in vehicles within its city limits.Other cities in the Bay Area have tried similar ideas, but experienced more friction. San Francisco established a safe parking site in 2022, originally designed to accommodate up to 150 vehicles. But the program never reached that scale.At its peak, the site housed roughly 35 vehicles, according to the San Francisco Chronicle. Infrastructure challenges — including a lack of on-site electricity — forced the city to rely on diesel generators, drawing complaints from neighbors and sparking a lawsuit. The city ultimately shut the site down, citing cost and operational challenges.Today, what may be the only designated RV parking site in San Francisco is privately operated. Once a low-cost option for tourists, Candlestick RV Park, in the city's industrial southeast corner, has increasingly become home to long-term residents, many of whom work but lack the savings or credit to secure a more traditional lease.\"We've transitioned from basically a tourist park to a long-term park, mainly due to the effects of the pandemic,\" said Tsin Fung, the park's manager, who has worked there since 1993.The price for a spot — which includes water, electricity, sewage hookups and bathrooms — is $2,500 per month. The park recently raised the rate for new tenants from $2,000 per month. \"They're hard-working people, and they're sort of middle-, lower-middle class, working class,\" Fung said. \"They work hard, they pay their bills.\" He also noted that he's become aware of some tenants renting their RVs from individuals outside the park, in so-called vanlording situations.\"We've transitioned from basically a tourist park to a long-term park, mainly due to the effects of the pandemic.\" Tsin FungRV park manager in San FranciscoRethinking RV parksBut housing construction alone may not close the gap quickly enough, said Covert of the Bay Area Council.\"We're coming off of 30- or 40-year trends of hostility from local governments across the state — really, across the country — toward mobile home parks and RV parks,\" Covert said. \"They've been seen as a blight. But what we're seeing now is that doesn't just make low-income people go away.\"Instead, he contends, well-managed RV parks should be reconsidered as part of the region's housing strategy.\"We aren't likely, in the near term, to have enough transitional or interim housing to move everybody indoors,\" he said.San Jose has set aside 128 RV spaces across two lots, offering residents a rent-free place to stay while they work with case managers to secure permanent housing.CNBCUntil more permanent housing comes online, Covert said, cities may have little choice but to treat RVs not as an anomaly, but as part of the housing landscape.For Alvarez, the safe parking site provides stability while she continues searching for an apartment she and her boyfriend can afford — a place she's willing to move into if they can find one.\"I'm hoping I can,\" she said.",

    "body": "Phil Spencer, CEO of Microsoft Gaming, appears at the Political Opening of the Gamescom conference in Cologne, Germany, on Aug. 23, 2023.Franziska Krug | German Select | Getty ImagesMicrosoft's head of gaming, Phil Spencer, is leaving the software maker following a 38-year tenure, as the company's Xbox business faces increased challenges.\"Last year, Phil Spencer made the decision to retire from the company, and since then we've been talking about succession planning,\" Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella wrote in a memo to employees that was published on Friday. \"I want to thank Phil for his extraordinary leadership and partnership.\" Spencer's exit follows the departures of business development chief Chris Young and GitHub CEO Thomas Dohmke in 2025. Charlie Bell, who had been Microsoft's most high-ranking security leader, switched to an individual contributor role earlier this month.Revenue from video games at Microsoft declined about 10% in the December quarter from a year earlier, a steeper drop than the company expected, while total revenue grew nearly 17%. Microsoft announced an unspecified impairment charge in its gaming business in January.The company made a $75 billion bet to expand its games business with the 2023 acquisition of Activision Blizzard, and it released Call of Duty titles as a cloud service. But current generation Xbox consoles haven't been as popular as Sony's PlayStation or Nintendo's Switch, and Microsoft has shuttered studios working on new games.Nadella said in the memo that Spencer, who took charge of Xbox in 2014 after running the company's gaming studios, nearly tripled Microsoft's gaming business, in part through acquisitions like Activision Blizzard. Spencer also pushed for Microsoft to take over Minecraft developer Mojang. \"Over 38 years at Microsoft, including 12 years leading Gaming, Phil helped transform what we do and how we do it,\" Nadella wrote.After Nadella became CEO in 2014, Sony was selling more consoles than Microsoft, and investors had floated the idea of spinning out consumer assets such as Xbox. Analyst Rick Sherlund of Nomura estimated that the division could lose more than $1 billion for the year.\"The question is, do we go forward with Xbox?\" Spencer said in a 2020 interview with gaming website Shacknews. Spencer said he persuaded Nadella to bring hardware, software and game-development groups into one organization.Asha Sharma, who joined Microsoft in 2024 from Instacart, will take over for Spencer, becoming CEO of gaming and reporting to Nadella. Until now, she has been president of product in Microsoft's Core AI business, which former Meta executive Jay Parikh runs. Before arriving at Instacart in 2021 and serving as operating chief, Sharma spent four years as a vice president of product and engineering at Meta and two years in marketing at Microsoft. \"We will recommit to our core Xbox fans and players, those who have invested with us for the past 25 years, and to the developers who build the expansive universes and experiences that are embraced by players across the world,\" Sharma wrote in a message to Microsoft's gaming employees.She has worked on artificial intelligence products such as the Foundry for incorporating AI models into third-party applications. \"As monetization and AI evolve and influence this future, we will not chase short-term efficiency or flood our ecosystem with soulless AI slop,\" Sharma wrote. \"Games are and always will be art, crafted by humans, and created with the most innovative technology provided by us.\" Sharma said Microsoft will renew its commitment to console gaming. Microsoft's original Xbox came out in 2001.Matt Booty, head of Microsoft's gaming studios, will report to Sharma as executive vice president and chief content officer.\"Together, Asha and Matt have the right combination of consumer product leadership and gaming depth to push our platform innovation and content pipeline forward,\" Nadella wrote.Sarah Bond, president and operating chief of the Xbox unit, will leave Microsoft.\"I've had the privilege of spending time with Asha over the last few weeks as we've planned for this transition, and I've seen firsthand her deep commitment to our players, developers, and brand,\" Bond told Xbox employees in a message she also posted to LinkedIn. \"She brings deep technology and commerce experience, along with a strong track record of building and scaling platforms that the world uses. Xbox deserves this.\"Bond and Spencer both said they will advise Sharma on the transition.WATCH: Microsoft is still a buy for the longer term investor, says CFRA's Sam Stovall",

That means sophisticated players scrutinized the loans and the companies involved and felt comfortable paying nearly full price for the debt, a message that Blue Owl co-President Craig Packer sought to convey in interviews several times this week.But instead of calming markets, it sent shares of Blue Owl and other alternative asset managers diving on fears of what could follow. That's because as part of the asset sale, Blue Owl announced it was replacing voluntary quarterly redemptions with mandated \"capital distributions\" funded by future asset sales, earnings or other transactions.\"The optics are bad, even if the loan book is fine,\" Brian Finneran of Truist Securities wrote in commentary circulated Thursday. \"Most investors are interpreting the sales to mean that redemptions accelerated and led to forced sales of higher quality assets to meet requests.\"Blue Owl's move was widely interpreted as the firm halting redemptions from a fund under pressure, even as Packer pointed out investors would get about 30% of their money back by March 31, far more than the 5% allowed under its previous quarterly schedule.\"We're not halting redemptions, we're just changing the form,\" Packer told CNBC on Friday. \"If anything, we're accelerating redemptions.\"watch nowComing amid a broad tech and software selloff fueled by fears of AI disruption, the episode shows that even apparently strong loan books aren't immune to market jitters. This in turn forces alternative lenders to scramble to satisfy shareholders' sudden demands for the return of their money.It also exposed a central tension in private credit: What happens when illiquid assets collide with demands for liquidity?Against a backdrop that was already fragile for private credit since the collapse of auto firms Tricolor and First Brands, the fear that this could be an early sign of credit markets cracking took off. Shares of Blue Owl fell Thursday and Friday. They are down more than 50% in the past year. Early Thursday, the economist and former Pimco CEO Mohamed El-Erian wondered in social media posts whether Blue Owl was a \"canary in the coal mine\" for a future crisis, like the failure of a pair of Bear Stearns credit funds in 2007. On Friday, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said that he was \"concerned\" about the possibility that risks from Blue Owl had migrated to the regulated financial system because one of the institutional buyers was an insurance company.Mostly softwareWith skepticism over loans to software firms running high, one question from investors was whether the loans they sold were a representative slice of the total funds, or whether Blue Owl cherry-picked the best loans to sell.The underlying loans were to 128 companies across 27 industries, the largest being software, the firm said.Blue Owl indicated it was a broad swath of overall loans in the funds: \"Each investment to be sold represents a partial amount of each Blue Owl BDC's exposure to the respective portfolio company.\"Despite its efforts to calm markets, Blue Owl finds itself at the nexus of concerns around private credit loans made to software firms.Most of the 200-plus companies Blue Owl lends to are in software; more than 70% of its loans are to that category, executives said Wednesday in a fourth-quarter earnings call. \"We remain enthusiastic proponents of software,\" Packer said on that call. \"Software is an enabling technology that can serve every sector and market and company in the world. It's not a monolith.\"The company makes loans to firms \"with durable moats\" and is protected by the seniority of its loans, meaning that private equity owners would need to be wiped out before Blue Owl saw losses.But, for now at least, the problem Blue Owl faces is one of perception bleeding into reality.\"The market is reacting, and it becomes this self-fulfilling idea, where they get more redemptions, so they have to sell more loans, and that drives the stock down further,\" said Ben Emmons, founder of FedWatch Advisors.",

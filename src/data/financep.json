    "body": "U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent speaks to reporters at the White House in Washington, D.C., Oct. 22, 2025.  Kevin Lamarque | ReutersTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Monday confirmed that the list of candidates to replace Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has been winnowed down to five, and President Donald Trump said the replacement is likely to be named by the end of the year.Speaking to reporters on Air Force One, Bessent said the finalists are current Fed Governors Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman, National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett, former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh, and BlackRock executive Rick Rieder, according to several media outlets.Those names were reported earlier this month by CNBC.Bessent, who had been rumored to be a top candidate as well, said he has been conducting interviews and that he expects to do one more round before presenting a \"good slate\" to Trump after the Thanksgiving holiday.Trump, also speaking to reporters Monday on Air Force One, said he anticipates naming a replacement by the end of the year. Powell's term doesn't expire until May. Powell then can either step down from the Fed entirely or continue serving a term as governor that lasts until 2028.The Federal Open Market Committee meets this week, with an interest rate decision due Wednesday. Markets are pricing in a near certainty that the committee will lower its benchmark overnight borrowing rate by a quarter percentage point, which would follow a similar cut in September.Trump has three appointees on the seven-member board of governors: Waller and Bowman, as well as Stephen Miran, who is filling an unexpired term that ends in January. Miran, who was confirmed in September as the head of the Council of Economic Advisers, is not expected to be reappointed. He has campaigned for the FOMC to be more aggressive in easing.Should Powell opt to leave the Fed, that would give Trump four appointees. Trump thus far has been unsuccessful in trying to remove Governor Lisa Cook from the board. A rotating cast of five regional presidents joins the governors as voters during the FOMC meeting.",

Photographer: SeongJoon Cho/Bloomberg via Getty ImagesBloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesSouth Korea's economy expanded at its fastest pace in more than a year, with its third-quarter gross domestic product growth topping analysts' estimates on Tuesday.According to advance estimates from Bank of Korea, GDP rose 1.7%, year on year, compared to the 1.5% rise expected by economists polled by Reuters. The economy had grown by 0.6% in the second quarter.Data from the Bank of Korea revealed that growth was mostly supported by exports and the manufacturing sector that expanded 6% and 3.3%, respectively, year on year.Construction sector was the biggest drag on the economy, contracting 8.1% in the reported quarter compared to a year earlier.The growth in exports of goods and services, which came on the back of increased semiconductor and motor vehicle shipments, was the fastest since the third quarter of 2024.On a quarter-on-quarter basis, the country's GDP expanded 1.2%, also beating Reuters poll estimates of a 0.9% growth.South Korea's GDP data comes as the country's negotiators continue to wrangle over details of a trade deal with the Trump administration. In an interview with Bloomberg last Friday, South Korea's President Lee Jae Myung said that the two country's were deadlocked on key details over Seoul's $350 billion investment pledge.\"The U.S. will of course try to maximize its interests, but it mustn't be to the extent that causes catastrophic consequences for South Korea,\" Lee said in the interview.In July, South Korea reached a trade deal with Trump that featured blanket tariffs on the country's exports to U.S. at 15% — down from the 25% Trump announced earlier. In return, Seoul had pledged to invest $350 billion in the U.S.Lee is set to meet Trump on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit being held in Gyeongju, South Korea, later this week.The Bank of Korea in its statement last Thursday said that the economy has continued to improve, supported by a sustained recovery in consumption and favorable exports growth.\"Going forward, domestic demand is expected to continue its recovery, led by consumption, and exports are likely to remain favourable for some time owing to the strong semiconductor sector, but the impacts of U.S. tariffs on exports are likely to expand gradually,\" the BOK added.The central bank has forecast full-year growth for 2025 at 0.9%, and 1.6% for 2026",

    "body": "Dan Rosensweig, CEO, CheggScott Mlyn | CNBCChegg said on Monday it would lay off about 45% of its workforce, or 388 employees, as the \"new realities\" of artificial intelligence and diminished traffic from internet search have led to plummeting revenue. The online education company, founded 20 years ago, has been hit by the rise of generative AI software tools, such as OpenAI's ChatGPT, which have become increasingly popular among students. Chegg also sued Google in February, arguing that AI summaries of search results have hurt its traffic and sales.The company reiterated that claim on Monday, saying AI and \"reduced traffic from Google to content publishers\" have damaged its business.\"As a result, and reflecting the company's continued investment in AI, Chegg is restructuring the way it operates its academic learning products,\" the company said.The cuts come after Chegg in May laid off 22% of its workforce, citing increasing adoption of AI.Chegg went public in 2013 and saw its stock price hit a high of $113.51 in February 2021, boosted by the Covid pandemic and a shift to remote learning. The stock has since lost 99% of its value. Its market cap peaked at about $14.7 billion, before falling to roughly $156 million.The company offers textbook rentals, homework help and tutoring, as well as a newer suite of AI tools like a service that automatically generates flashcards.As part of Monday's announcement, the company said Dan Rosensweig will return as CEO effective immediately, replacing Nathan Schultz, who will step down from the role and remain as an executive advisor to Rosensweig and Chegg's board.Rosensweig, a former top executive at Yahoo who joined Chegg as CEO in 2010, stepped down from the post in April 2024, handing the job to Schultz, who was operating chief at the time.Chegg also said it plans to remain a standalone company, ending a strategic review process that began earlier this year.\"After thoughtful consideration of multiple proposals, the board unanimously determined that remaining an independent public company offers the best opportunity to maximize long-term shareholder value,\" the company said.In April, Chegg was at risk of being delisted from the New York Stock Exchange. Chegg received the warning when the stock was trading at about 60 cents. Trading below $1 over a consecutive 30 trading-day period triggers a warning. By May, the stock was back over $1.— CNBC's Ari Levy contributed to this report.WATCH: Chegg sues Google over AI-generated information blurbs in searcheswatch now",

Kevin Lamarque | ReutersRussia's testing of an \"invincible\" nuclear-powered cruise missile with a potentially \"unlimited range\" has been met with a less-than impressed response from U.S. President Donald Trump as a new cold front opens up between the countries.Russia announced Sunday that it had successfully tested a new nuclear-powered cruise missile, the 9M730 Burevestnik (or 'Storm Petrel'), on Tuesday last week.It boasted that the missile, which can carry conventional or nuclear warheads, and code-named 'Skyfall' by NATO, can change direction mid-flight and move vertically and horizontally, meaning it can evade missile and air defense systems.President Trump, who's undertaking a whirlwind tour of Asia and is also set to meet Chinese President Xi Jinping on Thursday, was not impressed with the missile launch, telling reporters Monday that Putin should focus on ending the war in Ukraine instead.\"I don't think its an appropriate thing for Putin to be saying, either, by the way: You ought to get the war ended, the war that should have taken one week is now in ... its fourth year, that's what you ought to do instead of testing missiles,\" Trump told reporters on Air Force One on Monday.U.S. President Donald Trump looks on next to people waving Malaysian national flags before he departs on Air Force One from Kuala Lumpur International Airport in Sepang on Oct. 27, 2025.Andrew Caballero-Reynolds | AFP | Getty ImagesHe also denigrated the use case for the Russian missile, stating that the U.S. did not need a weapon that could fly so far as it had a nuclear submarine off the coast of Russia.\"They know we have a nuclear submarine, the greatest in the world, right off their shores, so I mean, it doesn't have to go 8,000 miles,\" Trump said, according to an audio file published by the White House.\"They're not playing games with us and we're not playing games with them either,\" Trump added. \"We test missiles all the time.\"The Kremlin responded to that on Monday by saying that \"Russia is consistently working to ensure its own security. It is in line with this objective that the development of new weapons systems, including the aforementioned [Burevestnik] system, is taking place,\" Putin's Press Spokesman Dmitry Peskov said, in comments reported by Russian state media agency TASS.\"Russia must do everything possible to guarantee its own security,\" Peskov added.Test carefully timedThe timing of the test does not appear to be accidental, taking place on the same day that Russia was left humiliated and sidelined after Trump cancelled upcoming talks that were due to be held with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Hungary.Eager to flex its military muscle, and likely a warning to Trump who has been considering whether to give Ukraine long-range Tomahawk missiles capable of striking targets deep within Russia, Moscow declared on Sunday that it had successfully tested its Burevestnik missile.During the test, the missile travelled 14,000 kilometers (or 8,700 miles). It was in the air for about 15 hours and this was \"not the limit,\" Valery Gerasimov, chief of the general staff of Russia's armed forces, told Putin on Sunday, in comments reported by TASS.Putin applauded the test as he visited a command post for troops fighting in Ukraine, where he was briefed on the frontline situation, the Kremlin said in a statement on Sunday.Putin told military officials that such missiles were \"unique products, unmatched anywhere else in the world,\" in comments translated by AP.Russia's President Vladimir Putin and Chief of the General Staff Valery Gerasimov.Grigory Sysoyev | Afp | Getty ImagesRussia says such missiles are part of its nuclear deterrence, with Putin stating Sunday that the country's \"nuclear deterrent is at the highest level. It's probably no exaggeration to say that it's at least higher than that of all nuclear states.\" He added, however, that Russia would now work to put such weapons \"on combat alert.\"On the same day that Russia basked in an apparent show of strength, the Kremlin warned that any strikes inside Russia would be met with an \"overwhelming\" response.Souring relationsRelations between Washington and Moscow took a turn for the worse last week after the White House announced that s planned meeting between Putin and Trump would be postponed indefinitely as the White House leader said he didn't want to \"have a wasted meeting.\"Trump added that the in-person summit was canceled because \"every time I speak to Vladimir, I have good conversations and then they don't go anywhere.\"The announcement was met with a stony silence from the Kremlin as senior Russian officials blamed Western media and \"fake news\" for the abandoned talks, which had been previously been lauded by Russian state media as a coup for Moscow as it vies with Ukraine for Trump's ear, and support.",

Small-cap names are witnessing a decline over the same period, the firm found.\"While productivity for the S&P 500 has soared 5.5% since ChatGPT, it's down 12.3% for the Russell 2000,\" Wells Fargo equity strategist Ohsung Kwon wrote in recent note to clients. \"We see other examples of diverging trends in consumer, industrial, and financial markets.\"Wells Fargo analysis comparing real revenue per worker between Russell 2000 and S&P 500 indicesWells FargoBreakthrough advancements in AI this year have led major corporations such as Amazon to notably go all-in on the technology, finding ways to eliminate human roles that can be replaced by AI machines.The performance of the S&P 500 versus the Russell 2000 small-cap index reflect this divergence in productivity gains. The broad market index is up 74% since ChatGPT's 2022 launch, while the Russell is up only 39%.The biggest U.S. companies have been internally deploying AI tools over the past few years to improve their productivity and supply chains and, in some cases, cut head count. A World Economic Forum survey published at the start of 2025 found that roughly 40% of companies around the world expect to reduce their workforces over the next five years in roles where AI can automate tasks.Layoffs this year have been on the rise. Several big-name companies, including Target, Amazon, Meta, Starbucks, Oracle, Microsoft and UPS, have announced significant cuts to their total head count. For Target, the cuts are historic. Amazon is expected to announce historic cuts on Tuesday. Companies have mostly cited efforts to streamline operations and growth strategy as reasons for cuts, but many are nodding at AI as part of the reason that human worker roles can be axed now or in the future.For one, Amazon has been a leader in robot deployment across its facilities, which the e-commerce giant has said is improving costs and delivery times. The New York Times reported this month that Amazon executives believe the company is on track to replace more than half a million jobs with robots, which they think will save about 30 cents on each item Amazon selects, packs and delivers to customers. Morgan Stanley said Amazon's robotics efforts can save the company between $2 billion and $4 billion by 2027.Klarna, which has been among the most transparent in how AI is affecting its head count, said it has shrunk its workforce by about 40%, in part due to its AI investments. CrowdStrike in May announced cuts to 5% of the company's global workforce, citing AI efficiencies and saying that the technology \"flattens our hiring curve.\" IBM's CEO has forecast 30% of non-customer-facing roles will be cut by 2028 and told The Wall Street Journal earlier this year that AI chatbots have replaced 200 HR employees, freeing up investments to hire more people in sales and programming.Palo Alto Networks, Walmart and McDonald's are other companies that have notably been leveraging AI in ways that analysts expect will improve margins, CNBC previously reported.An Intuit QuickBooks Small Business Insights survey of 5,000 small businesses in the U.S., Canada, the U.K., and Australia in September revealed that 68% of businesses have integrated AI into their daily operations, with roughly two-thirds reporting an increase in productivity.\"The numbers don't lie,\" Wells Fargo's Kwon said in his report.",

The tech factors in the length of a stay, the distance from a guest's location, property type and timing of a booking to block reservations deemed \"higher risk.\"\"We lead the way in proactive measures to reduce the risk of unauthorized parties, and our heightened technology for Halloween is one important layer in a comprehensive suite of policies and tools to support hosts, guests and local communities, and promote responsible travel,\" the company wrote in a release.This isn't the first time Airbnb has attempted to block parties during holidays.Last year, the company said it prevented about 38,000 people in the U.S. and 6,300 in Canada from making bookings during Halloween weekend. The company has also used the tech during New Year's Eve and summer holidays like Memorial Day and the Fourth of July.Airbnb said the rate of parties reported worldwide has dropped by 50% since it implemented a ban on parties and events in 2020 to curb the spread of Covid. The party ban became official in 2022.The company cracked down on parties and implemented a number of new safety measures in 2019 in response to a deadly shooting at an Airbnb booking that left five dead.Following the shooting, CEO Brian Chesky announced a ban on \"party houses\" in a post to the social media platform now known as X. At the time, Chesky said that the company was also cracking down on \"abusive host and guest conduct.\"Airbnb said accounts that break the no party policy will be suspended or banned from the platform. The company also said its offers features like a 24-hour safety line and noise sensor for hosts.WATCH: Airbnb CEO Brian Chesky on new product updates, integrating AI and state of AI tech racewatch now",

    "body": "A view of the logo of HSBC bank on a wall outside a branch in Mexico City, Mexico, on June 14, 2024.Henry Romero | ReutersHSBC said on Monday that it will recognize a provision of $1.1 billion in its third quarter results following a court ruling in Luxembourg related to the Bernard Madoff investment fraud case.Herald Fund SPC sued HSBC's Luxembourg unit in 2009, claiming restitution of securities and cash it said were lost in the fraud.The court denied HSBC unit's appeal in respect of Herald's securities restitution claim, but accepted the unit's appeal in respect of the cash restitution claim.The bank will now pursue a second appeal before the Luxembourg Court of Appeal, and added that if unsuccessful, it would contest the amount to be paid in subsequent proceedings.HSBC shares in Hong Kong closed down 1.1%, while its London-listed stock was last trading 1.3% lower.Madoff was described as the mastermind of the largest investment fraud in U.S., defrauding clients of as much as $65 billion. He pleaded guilty in 2009 to a scheme that started in the early 1970s, ripping off more than 40,000 people in 125 countries over four decades, before being caught on Dec. 11, 2008.Madoff, whose victims included director Steven Spielberg and actor Kevin Bacon, was sentenced to 150 years in prison. He passed away in 2021.In its interim report for 2025 released in July, HSBC said Herald had claimed a restitution of securities and cash of $2.5 billion plus interest, or damages of $5.6 billion plus interest from HSBC.HSBC, Europe's largest lender, said that various non-U.S. HSBC companies provided custodial, administration and similar services to a number of funds whose assets were invested with Bernard Madoff Investment Securities.The news comes a day before HSBC is due to announce its results, with the bank saying that the $1.1 billion provision will impact its Common Equity Tier 1, or CET1, ratio by about 15 basis points. The CET1 ratio is a measure of a bank's financial strength, and is used to determine its ability to withstand distress.Estimates from analysts compiled by the bank on Oct. 17 had forecast CET1 ratio for the third quarter to come in at 14.5%, compared to 14.6% in the second quarter.Lorraine Tan, director of equity research for Asia at Morningstar, told CNBC that she does not think that the $1.1 billion charge would have an impact on operations, but it could weigh on sentiment slightly as HSBC was \"hoping that these one-off impairments were cleaned up after the interim write-offs.\"HSBC's allowance for expected credit losses as of June increased by $500 million compared with Dec. 31, including adverse foreign exchange movements of 400 million, and write-offs of $2 billion, according to the bank's interim report.Morningstar's assumption is that HSBC CET1 ratio will be at around 14.4% for the third quarter, and hover at the 14% over the next 10 years.HSBC, which said that the final financial impact from the ruling could be \"significantly different,\" given the pending appeals, is currently undergoing a restructuring under CEO Georges Elhedery, and will see the bank split its operations into four divisions.The bank has said the reorganization will cut costs by about $300 million this year, creating separate \"Eastern markets\" and \"Western markets\" sectors.— CNBC's Marty Steinberg and Scott Cohn contributed to this report.",

    "body": "watch nowQualcomm announced Monday that it will release new artificial intelligence accelerator chips, marking new competition for Nvidia, which has so far dominated the market for AI semiconductors.The stock soared 11% following the news.The AI chips are a shift from Qualcomm, which has thus far focused on semiconductors for wireless connectivity and mobile devices, not massive data centers.Qualcomm said that both the AI200, which will go on sale in 2026, and the AI250, planned for 2027, can come in a system that fills up a full, liquid-cooled server rack.Qualcomm is matching Nvidia and AMD, which offer their graphics processing units, or GPUs, in full-rack systems that allow as many as 72 chips to act as one computer. AI labs need that computing power to run the most advanced models.Qualcomm's data center chips are based on the AI parts in Qualcomm's smartphone chips called Hexagon neural processing units, or NPUs.\"We first wanted to prove ourselves in other domains, and once we built our strength over there, it was pretty easy for us to go up a notch into the data center level,\" Durga Malladi, Qualcomm's general manager for data center and edge, said on a call with reporters last week.The entry of Qualcomm into the data center world marks new competition in the fastest-growing market in technology: equipment for new AI-focused server farms.Nearly $6.7 trillion in capital expenditures will be spent on data centers through 2030, with the majority going to systems based around AI chips, according to a McKinsey estimate.Read more CNBC tech newsOpenAI's spending bonanza has Wall Street focused on capex in Big Tech earnings reportsAI spending is boosting the economy, but many businesses are in survival modeApple begins shipping American-made AI servers from TexasEU says TikTok and Meta broke transparency rules under landmark tech lawThe industry has been dominated by Nvidia, whose GPUs have over 90% of the market so far and sales of which have driven the company to a market cap of over $4.5 trillion. Nvidia's chips were used to train OpenAI's GPTs, the large language models used in ChatGPT.But companies such as OpenAI have been looking for alternatives, and earlier this month the startup announced plans to buy chips from the second-place GPU maker, AMD, and potentially take a stake in the company. Other companies, such as Google, Amazon and Microsoft, are also developing their own AI accelerators for their cloud services.Qualcomm said its chips are focusing on inference, or running AI models, instead of training, which is how labs such as OpenAI create new AI capabilities by processing terabytes of data.The chipmaker said that its rack-scale systems would ultimately cost less to operate for customers such as cloud service providers, and that a rack uses 160 kilowatts, which is comparable to the high power draw from some Nvidia GPU racks.Malladi said Qualcomm would also sell its AI chips and other parts separately, especially for clients such as hyperscalers that prefer to design their own racks. He said other AI chip companies, such as Nvidia or AMD, could even become clients for some of Qualcomm's data center parts, such as its central processing unit, or CPU.\"What we have tried to do is make sure that our customers are in a position to either take all of it or say, 'I'm going to mix and match,'\" Malladi said.The company declined to comment, the price of the chips, cards or rack, and how many NPUs could be installed in a single rack. In May, Qualcomm announced a partnership with Saudi Arabia's Humain to supply data centers in the region with AI inferencing chips, and it will be Qualcomm's customer, committing to deploy up to as many systems as can use 200 megawatts of power.Qualcomm said its AI chips have advantages over other accelerators in terms of power consumption, cost of ownership, and a new approach to the way memory is handled. It said its AI cards support 768 gigabytes of memory, which is higher than offerings from Nvidia and AMD.Qualcomm's design for an AI server called AI200.QualcommStock Chart IconStock chart iconQualcomm one day stock chart.",

Nathan Posner | Anadolu | Getty ImagesThe largest union representing federal workers on Monday called for Democrats in Congress to end the ongoing government shutdown by voting for the stopgap funding measure that Republicans have proposed.\"It's time to pass a clean continuing resolution and end this shutdown today,\" Everett Kelley, president of the American Federation of Government Employees, wrote.\"No half measures, and no gamesmanship. Put every single federal worker back on the job with full back pay — today,\" said Kelley, whose union represents more than 800,000 federal and District of Columbia government workers.\"Because when the folks who serve this country are standing in line for food banks after missing a second paycheck because of this shutdown, they aren't looking for partisan spin,\" Kelley said. \"They're looking for the wages they earned. The fact that they're being cheated out of it is a national disgrace.\"The shutdown began on Oct. 1, and has led to about 900,000 federal workers being furloughed.Senate Democrats have largely resisted voting for the clean resolution, which would fund the government through Nov. 21, saying they want any funding measure to extend enhanced Affordable Care Act tax credits.Those subsidies, which are due to expire at the end of 2025, lower the cost of Obamacare health insurance plans for more than 20 million Americans.Republicans, in turn, say the fate of ACA tax credits should be addressed only after a funding resolution is passed.At least 60 senators need to vote for such a measure because of the Senate's filibuster rules. Republicans only hold 53 seats in that chamber.In his statement, Kelley did not explicitly address the question of the ACA subsidies, but he seemed to refer to it, writing, \"Reopen the government immediately under a clean continuing resolution that allows continued debate on larger issues.\"\"Both political parties have made their point, and still there is no clear end in sight,\" Kelley wrote. \"Unfortunately, shutdowns have become a recurring tactic in Washington.\"\"But there is no 'winning' a government shutdown. They cost taxpayers billions, hurt small businesses, and erode confidence in government itself,\" he said.",

The four countries, part of an 11-member regional bloc called the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), pledged to remove trade barriers, provide preferential market access to U.S. goods, and increase purchases of American agricultural, energy products, and aircraft.They also agreed to cooperate with Washington on export controls, sanctions and access to critical minerals — commitments that appear to strengthen Trump's standing in a region where Beijing has a growing clout.watch nowWendy Cutler, senior vice president at Asia Society Policy Institute, said that the agreements focused on \"cooperation rather than hard commitments,\" with many important points \"considerably shorter\" than prior U.S. trade agreements.\"The U.S. can impose tariffs or terminate the agreement if it considers Malaysia in violation of commitments,\" Cutler added.In Japan, Trump is expected to meet Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi and the emperor before flying to South Korea, capping the trip with a  of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation, or APEC, summit.Chinese Premier Li Qiang, who also flew in to Malaysia for the 28th China-ASEAN Summit, stopped by Singapore, where he witnessed the signing of eight agreements covering trade and the digital economy.Scant detailsWhile the diplomatic momentum appeared strong, few details were released about the scope of the new trade frameworks.Under the agreements, Washington will keep a 19% tariff rate on most exports from Malaysia, Cambodia and Thailand, while some products will face no duties, according to joint statements from the White House.Tariffs on Vietnam will remain at 20% with some goods eligible for duty-free access, according to the joint statement. Vietnam, which recorded a trade surplus of $123 billion with the U.S. last year, also pledged to step up purchases of American products to address the trade imbalance.Malaysia agreed not to impose bans or quotas on U.S.-bound exports of critical minerals and to speed up development of its rare-earth projects needed by American companies.The country, which sits on an estimated 16.1 million tonnes of rare earth deposits, has enforced a nationwide moratorium on the export of unprocessed rare earth materials since last year to develop its downstream industries and prevent resource exploitation.Thailand will ease tariff barriers on U.S. goods by accepting some American-made vehicles, medical devices and pharmaceuticals, and by importing ethanol for fuel. It also pledged to relax foreign ownership restrictions for U.S. investors in the telecommunications sector.The agreements left open the possibility of additional product exemptions to be decided later, said Michael Wan, economist at MUFG Bank. He noted that sectoral tariffs on pharmaceuticals and electronics would remain key, as would questions over the legality of Trump's use of an emergency powers law to impose them.Peace dealAside from trade agreements, Trump announced the formalization of an extended truce between Thailand and Cambodia, building on a ceasefire that he brokered in July following their violent border clashes this summer.Trump, who has cast himself as a global peace broker, said the deal showed his administration has done \"something that a lot of people said couldn't be done, and we saved maybe millions of lives.\"watch now\"My administration immediately began working to prevent the conflict from escalating,\" Trump said. \"Everybody was sort of amazed that we got it done so quickly.\"Trump-Xi Seoul meetingAs Trump mingled with other leaders in Malaysia, U.S. and Chinese negotiators met on the sidelines of the ASEAN summit, where the bilateral talks yielded a framework ahead of an expected meeting between Trump and Xi in South Korea on Thursday.\"Markets are increasingly getting used to a 'punch-first, negotiate-second' tariffs overture,\" said John Woods, chief investment officer at Lombard Odier.Chinese top trade negotiator Li Chenggang said Sunday that a preliminary consensus had been reached after \"very intense discussions\" on a range of issues, including export controls, fentanyl and shipping fees.The next step, he said, was for both sides to complete their domestic approval procedures.watch nowIn an interview with CBS on Sunday, U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said that Trump's threat of 100% tariffs is \"effectively off the table\" after a \"very good two-day meeting\" with Chinese officials.Speaking separately to ABC News' \"This Week,\" Bessent said the negotiations produced a \"substantial framework\" that could ease concerns among American soybean farmers over China's boycott.China bought more than half of U.S. soybeans in 2023 and 2024, accounting for nearly $12.8 billion in 2024. But Beijing halted purchases earlier this year after Trump ignited a trade war.Bessent also told ABC News that he expected China to delay its rare earth export controls, set to take effect in the coming weeks, by one year. Trump and Xi could \"consummate\" a deal to allow TikTok to continue to operate in the U.S., Bessent added.\"We believe both sides, after testing the other's boundaries, will likely make concessions again,\" said Ting Lu, China economist at Nomura, who expects the additional 100% tariffs on Chinese goods will \"surely not be implemented\" with both sides likely to extend the existing tariff truce.In return, Lu added, Beijing may resume purchases of U.S. soybeans and ease the enforcement of its rare earth export controls.",

    "body": "Artificial intelligence startup Mercor announced on Monday a new Series C round that values the company at $10 billion, a fivefold increase since its last raise in February.The company said in a blog post that it raised $350 million in a round led by Felicis, which also led its $100 million Series B round, with participation from Benchmark, General Catalyst, and new investor Robinhood Ventures.The new investment will feed into three focus areas: Expanding the company's talent network, advancing its matching systems between experts and training opportunities, and providing faster delivery.Founded by three Thiel Fellows, the company initially started as a hiring company that assessed candidates by analyzing interview transcripts, resumes and personal portfolio websites to make recruiting decisions.After inadvertently amassing a network of specialized experts, the startup has pivoted to hiring highly skilled professionals to train AI models.Read more CNBC tech newsOpenAI's spending bonanza has Wall Street focused on capex in Big Tech earnings reportsAI spending is boosting the economy, but many businesses are in survival modeApple begins shipping American-made AI servers from TexasEU says TikTok and Meta broke transparency rules under landmark tech lawMercor now manages over 30,000 contractors, who are collectively paid over $1.5 million each day and teach agents to think more like humans by \"sharing knowledge, experience, and context that can't be captured in code alone,\" the startup wrote in a blog post.The company was able to take advantage of the pivot to data-labeling after Meta paid $14.3 billion for a 49% stake in Scale AI in June. As part of the deal, founder and then CEO Alexandr Wang stepped down to join the social media company.Concerns over Scale AI's neutrality following the Meta investment reportedly caused some large AI labs, including Google and OpenAI, to cut ties following the deal.\"It just doesn't happen too often in startups where your biggest competitor gets torpedoed overnight,\" cofounder Adarsh Hiremath told Forbes.The startup still faces competition in the data-labeling space, including Scale AI rival Surge AI, which is reportedly aiming for up to $1 billion in a new raise, according to Reuters. Turing AI reached a valuation of $2.2 billion in March, and Invisible Technologies raised $100 million in a new round to reach a value of over $2 billion in September.watch now",

    "body": "Timothy Mellon, seen outside an inspection train during a property tour in 1981. Exact date and location unknown.AP PhotoThe mystery donor whose $130 million contribution is meant to pay U.S. military troops during the government shutdown is Timothy Mellon, an heir to a renowned Gilded Age banking family, The New York Times reported Saturday.But Mellon's donation works out to only about $100 per service member. It costs nearly $6.4 billion to pay U.S. troops every two weeks.And using his money might run afoul of federal law, according to the Times, which cited two people familiar with the matter in identifying the billionaire railroad magnate as the donor.When President Donald Trump announced the donation at the White House on Thursday, he did not identify the man by name, but described him as a \"great patriot\" and a \"friend of mine.\"\"And he's a big supporter of mine,\" Trump told reporters on Friday night. \"He's a wonderful man, and he doesn't want publicity.\"Mellon has an estimated net worth close to $1 billion, according to Forbes.But in an email to the news outlet in 2024, Mellon wrote, \"Billionaire NOT! ... Never have been, never will be.\"Mellon's contribution aims to help cover the cost of U.S. military personnel's salaries and benefits as the federal shutdown drags on.Read more CNBC government shutdown coverageGovernment shutdown becomes 2nd longest in U.S. historyThis week's critical inflation report comes with doubts about the dataHow to get student loan help during the government shutdownWhite House economic advisor Hassett says shutdown could end this weekArmy Corps of Engineers pausing $11 billion in projects over shutdown: VoughtGovernment shutdown: Trump distrust keeps Democrats from forming 'gang'Bill to fund military during government shutdown fails in Senate procedural voteThe donation might have violated the Antideficiency Act, which bars federal agencies from spending funds that have not been appropriated by Congress, the Times reported.Mellon's gift is also unlikely to go far in offsetting the cost of military pay.There are more than 1.3 million troops in the active-duty military, and the Trump administration's 2025 budget included a request of around $600 billion in military compensation, the Times reported.Mellon, whose grandfather, Andrew Mellon, was one of the longest-serving Treasury secretaries, is a longtime Trump donor.He contributed $50 million to Trump's super PAC during the 2024 election cycle, one of the biggest single donations ever publicly shared, The Times reported.A spokesman for Sen. Chris Coons told NBC News that the Delaware Democrat is concerned about allowing anonymous donors to fund government spending.\"Using anonymous donations to fund our military raises troubling questions of whether our own troops are at risk of literally being bought and paid for by foreign powers,\" the spokesman said.Read the complete Times report here.",

    "body": "Many U.S. workers are ringing in the new year with a raise as new minimum wage increases take effect in states and localities across the country on Thursday.More than 8.3 million workers are expected to benefit from minimum wage hikes in 19 states, which will collectively add an estimated $5 billion in earnings nationwide, according to a December report by the Economic Policy Institute.On top of changes to state minimum wages, many cities and municipalities with local wage standards increased their minimum wages Thursday as well. For example, Seattle's minimum wage rose to $21.30 an hour, and the minimum wage in Minneapolis is now $16.37 an hour.Minimum wage workers in Hawaii will see the largest jump in their hourly pay. The state's minimum wage rose by $2 per hour, from $14 to $16. Other states with minimum wage increases include Arizona, California, Michigan, New Jersey and New York.The federal minimum wage remains at $7.25 an hour, where it has stood since 2009.

    "body": "After 60 years at the helm of Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett stepped down as the holding company's CEO at the end of 2025. Throughout his career, the business and investing icon routinely shared wisdom to help others build successful lives, from  singing the praises of compound interest to offering a thought exercise for living without regrets.At Berkshire Hathaway's 2025 annual shareholder meeting, Buffett gave advice to those at the opposite end of their career as him: \"Don't worry too much about starting salaries and be very careful who you work for because you will take on the habits of the people around you,\" he told the audience in response to a question about lessons he learned early on. \"There are certain jobs you shouldn't take.\"Though it may be tempting for workers just starting out to accept whichever job offers the most competitive salary they can find, Buffett emphasized that other factors may be more important over the course of your career.'Find people that are wonderful to work with'While a good starting salary can help set you up for financial success, your coworkers and managers may play an outsized role in your long-term career success, Buffett said.\"Who you associate with is enormously important,\" he said. \"Don't expect that you'll make every decision right on that, but you are going to have your life progress in the general direction of the people that you work with, that you admire, that become your friends.\"He drew on his own experience of finding mentors who bestowed their wisdom upon him as a young person learning the ins and outs of running a business, and encouraged young people to find people in their own lives who have careers they admire and go work with them.\"I've had five bosses in life and I liked every one of them — they were all interesting. I still decided that I'd rather work for myself than anybody else,\" Buffett said. \"But if you find people that are wonderful to work with, that's the place to go.\"Don't do it for the moneyIn addition to surrounding yourself with smart and interesting people, Buffett said it's wise to look for a job you would do even if you didn't need the money. \"I've had that for a very long time,\" he added.Not only has the 95-year-old made a lot of money throughout his career, but he has often shared how much he's enjoyed his work and colleagues. \"I get to do what I like to do with people that I love,\" Buffett said in a 2008 interview. He encouraged young people to find a similarly meaningful career.\"It's interesting to me that in the investment business, so many people get out of it after they've made a pile of money,\" he said at Berkshire's shareholder meeting in 2025. \"You really want something that you'll stick around for whether you need the money or not.\"Want to give your kids the ultimate advantage?

    "body": "A turbine blade is lifted onto a rack near tower sections at the Revolution Wind project assembly site at State Pier in New London, Connecticut, US, on Friday, Oct. 24, 2025.Bloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesDanish renewables giant Orsted, the world's largest developer of offshore wind farms, said on Friday that it had launched legal action against the Trump administration over the suspension of its $5 billion Revolution Wind project. Shares of the Copenhagen-listed company rose more than 4% on the news, putting the stock among the top performers of the pan-European Stoxx 600 index.  Orsted said in a statement that it would seek a court injunction against the U.S. government's decision to halt its Revolution Wind project, located about 15 miles south of the Rhode Island coast.\"As was the case with the August 2025 stop-work order, the Revolution Wind Project … faces substantial harm from a continuation of the lease suspension order. As a result, litigation is a necessary step to protect the rights of the Project,\" Orsted said. \"Revolution Wind has spent and committed billions of dollars in reliance upon, and has met the requests of, a thorough review process,\" the company added.The pro-fossil fuel Trump administration suspended leases on Dec. 22 for five large offshore wind projects, including Revolution Wind, citing national security concerns identified by the Pentagon. The move marked the latest in a string of blows against offshore wind developers, with U.S. President Donald Trump having previously described wind turbines as \"ugly\" and an economic and environmental \"disaster.\" Revolution Wind is a 50/50 joint venture between Orsted and Global Infrastructure Partners' Skyborn Renewables. In a filing last year, Orsted and Skyborn Renewables said they had already spent approximately $5 billion on the project.",

    "body": "A new year is the perfect time to reflect on your financial habits and make small changes that can have a big impact. For over a decade, I've worked with clients navigating life transitions, like divorce and retirement, to help them forge their new financial paths. In my experience, there are six money personalities that represent the ways that people's money beliefs and attitudes play out in daily life. Here's my best money advice for each personality going into 2026: 1. The GiverThe Giver has a heart of gold and a generous spirit. Whether helping a friend in need, contributing to a worthy cause, or lending a hand to a stranger down on their luck, the Giver is always there. But this can lead to overspending, neglected personal financial needs, and even feelings of resentment.My best money advice for 2026For the Giver, the key is finding balance. With thoughtful planning and increased awareness of when to say no, you can continue to support others without jeopardizing your financial situation. When you find yourself in a pinch, remember that there are many ways to fill others' cups — as well as your own — that don't cost a dime. In fact, often your time and talents can make an even greater impact than your treasures.2. The TrailblazerTrailblazers don't follow the herd — they lead it. They exude confidence and embrace thoughtful risks. They are driven, focused, and relentless in their pursuit of success. But here's the twist: Their fierce independence can lead to burnout and a reluctance to ask for help.My best money advice for 2026While a Trailblazer may excel at creating wealth, managing it requires a much different skill set. It's important to learn how to delegate. By recognizing your limitations and leveraging the expertise of others, you can maximize the potential of your hard-earned money. This will ultimately reduce stress and enhance your overall financial success — allowing you to enjoy the fruits of your labor.3. The SkepticMoney? Nah, that's for the fat cats and money-grubbers. The Skeptic's mistrust can stunt their financial progress. They often feel caught between believing they don't deserve wealth and panicking at the thought of pursuing it. The result? They continue to repeat behaviors that leave them feeling financially insecure.My best money advice for 2026Writing down all your positive qualities can help you see that your worth isn't tied to your bank account. Surround yourself with people who are financially successful — as well as kind and generous — to help reshape your views on money. Witnessing how wealth can be used for good might help dismantle the assumption that it inherently breeds greed.4. The High RollerHigh Rollers live for the moment! Fancy things light them up. Saving for the future? Not so much. Their emotions can lead to impulsive purchases, and they can easily lose track of spending — which may result in a pile of debt. This constant pursuit of pleasure can cause the High Roller to feel empty inside. My best money advice for 2026Exploring how you cope with emotions, like boredom or anxiety, can help reduce impulse purchases. Budgeting apps or spending trackers, along with thoughtful discussions about the relationship between self-worth and material things, can help build self-awareness around spending habits. Transitioning to a cash-only system can also be a powerful tool for you — limiting your ability to rely on credit cards when you're tempted to splurge.5. The Penny PincherThe Penny Pincher is a perpetual saver, regardless of how much they have in the bank. They are disciplined and resourceful when it comes to spending (which is a good thing!) and often feel guilty after making a purchase — even when it's a necessity. Typically, they are debt- and risk-averse and fear losing it all, which can cause them to miss out on opportunities to effectively grow their wealth or benefit from valuable experiences.My best money advice for 2026Learning the basics of investing can empower the Penny Pincher to take calculated risks. Setting specific spending goals — like taking a dream vacation or planning fun nights out with friends — can help you shift your focus from what you might lose to what your money can help you gain and experience. This approach can build confidence and create a more balanced perspective.6. The AvoiderThe Avoider would rather not think about money, let alone talk about it. They typically have no idea where they stand financially. And frankly, most don't know where to start. But the more they avoid their situation, the more anxious they become.My best money advice for 2026Even the smallest actions can spark change. Dedicating just 10 minutes each week to reviewing your account balances, exploring your spending, or asking for help can empower you to confront your financial situation with less stress. Additionally, seeking resources like online articles, podcasts, or financial literacy classes can help you take actionable steps to improve your financial well-being.Keep in mindThese aren't meant to be reductive labels but rather lenses that build awareness of your current habits. Remember:These aren't rigid categories. Your behavior with money can change over time as life experiences shape new financial habits.Growth is always possible. Recognizing your tendencies empowers you to make intentional shifts and cultivate healthier behaviors.Identifying with multiple types is typical. It's common to exhibit traits from more than one personality type.And of course, you may want to seek personalized financial advice that's tailored to your specific needs.Steph Wagner is a nationally recognized thought leader in women's wealth and financial empowerment who serves as the National Director of Women & Wealth at Northern Trust.

    "body": "watch nowDemocratic Socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders and right-wing Gov. Ron DeSantis agree on virtually nothing. But they found common ground this year as leading skeptics of the artificial intelligence industry's data center boom. The alignment of two national figures on the left and right signals that a political reckoning is brewing over the AI industry's impact on electricity prices, grid stability and the labor market. The opposition could slow the industry's development plans if it reaches a broad bipartisan consensus. Sanders, I-VT, has called for a national moratorium on data center construction. \"Frankly, I think you've got to slow this process down,\" Sanders told CNN in a Dec. 28 interview. \"It's not good enough for the oligarchs to tell us it's coming — you adapt. What are they talking about? They're going to guarantee healthcare to all people? What are they going to do when people have no jobs?\"Florida Gov. DeSantis unveiled an AI bill of rights on Dec. 4 that would protect local communities' right to block data center construction among other provisions. The staunch Republican's proposal could run afoul of the White House, which is pushing to scale up AI as quickly as possible. President Donald Trump issued an executive order on Dec. 11 to prevent \"excessive state regulation\" of AI.\"We have a limited grid. You do not have enough grid capacity in the United States to do what they're trying to do,\" DeSantis said of the AI industry's data center plans at an event in The Villages, Florida. \"As more and more information has gotten out, do you want a hyperscale data center in The Villages? Yes or no,\" the governor asked. \"I think most people would say they don't want it.\" DeSantis is finishing out his second term as Florida's governor and his future political ambitions are unclear. Sanders has said his fourth term as Vermont's senator will likely be his last. Florida and Vermont are not major data center states. But rising utility bills played a key role in the landslide victory of Democrat Abigail Spanberger in the governor's race this year in Virginia, the world's largest data center market. Residential electricity prices are forecast to rise another 4% on average nationwide in 2026 after increasing about 5% in 2025, according to the federal Energy Information Administration. With cost of living at the center of American politics, the impact of data centers on local communities will likely play a role in the mid-term elections next November. \"We have gone from a period where data centers were sort of seen as an unmitigated good and as an engine of growth by a lot of elected officials and policymakers to people now recognizing that we're short,\" said Abe Silverman, who served as general counsel for the public utility board in New Jersey from 2019 until 2023 under Democrat Gov. Phil Murphy. \"We do not have enough generation to reliably serve existing customers and data centers,\" Silverman said. Crisis on the biggest gridThe shortage is most acute on the nation's largest grid, PJM Interconnection, where data center demand is pushing the system to a tipping point. The grid will be six gigawatts short of its reliability requirement by 2027, according to PJM. The power shortage is nearly equivalent to the electricity demand of Philadelphia, Silverman said. This makes blackouts more likely, he said. \"Instead of a blackout happening every one in 10 years, we're looking at something more often,\" the analyst said. \"It's at a crisis stage right now. PJM has never been this short,\" said Joe Bowring, president of Monitoring Analytics, which serves as the independent market monitor for PJM.  PJM Interconnection serves more than 65 million people across 13 states in the Mid-Atlantic and Midwest. It includes pivotal swing states for the mid-term elections like Pennsylvania and Virginia. The price to secure power capacity in PJM has exploded in recent years with $23 billion attributable to data centers, according to watchdog Monitoring Analytics. Those costs are ultimately passed on to consumers. This amounts to a \"massive wealth transfer,\" the watchdog told PJM in a November letter.  \"I don't think we've seen the end of the political repercussions,\" said Rob Gramlich, president of Grid Strategies, a power sector consulting firm. \"And with a lot more elections in 2026 than 2025, we'll see a lot of implications,\" Gramlich said. \"Every politician is going to be saying that they have the answer to affordability and their opponents' policies would raise rates.\" The shortage will be exacerbated by Trump's recent decision to pause all offshore wind farms under construction off the East Coast, Silverman said. This includes Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind, a massive 2.6 gigawatt project that would help supply the huge data center market in northern Virginia.\"By stopping a project that had line of sight to coming online in the very near future, you are directly increasing the prices that we all pay for electricity and not by a little bit,\" Silverman said. \"That's a huge, huge additional hole that we now have to dig out of.\"Data centers are facing pushback on multiple fronts now. The PJM watchdog has called for the grid to reject data centers that it does not have the power to serve or require them to bring their own generation. Virginia's utility regulator is now requiring data centers to pay a majority of the cost of new transmission and generation that serves them beginning in 2027. Data center developers next year will likely start moving to build more power plants onsite, called co-location, as they struggle to secure supply on the grid quickly, said Brian Fitzsimons, CEO of GridUnity, a company that uses software to help utilities navigate connection requests. But Silverman said \"co-location\" has problems that will also face political scrutiny.  \"Co-location is effectively taking a generator off the market,\" he said. \"It would be unethical to end up with a situation where data centers are able to buy private power plants that expose the rest of us to a greater chance of blackouts.\" ",

    "body": "2027 Ram 1500 SRT TRXStellantisDETROIT — Stellantis is resurrecting a V-8-powered Ram pickup truck called the TRX as the company faces fewer federal emissions regulations and enacts a U.S. sales turnaround plan for its brands. The automaker said Thursday that the 2027 Ram 1500 SRT TRX will be available late in 2026 for around $100,000. It was first produced for the 2021-2024 model years before being canceled as the company de-emphasized V-8 engines.The TRX is powered by a supercharged 6.2-liter \"Hellcat\" gas engine capable of 777 horsepower and 680 foot-pounds of torque. The automaker is calling it the \"fastest and most powerful production gas pickup truck in the world,\" capable of 0–60 mph in 3.5 seconds and a top speed of 118 mph.\"We had to push it to the next level,\" Ram CEO Tim Kuniskis said during a recent media event. \"We're super happy about this one coming back.\"Despite relatively low sales in the past due to the vehicle's price, the TRX is viewed as a \"halo\" model for the brand, or a high-end vehicle that brings attention to Ram and potentially boosts sales for other models. It's been a successful strategy for Kuniskis, especially with the company's SRT performance vehicles. 2027 Ram 1500 SRT TRXStellantis The return of the TRX is the latest move for the brand under Kuniskis, who has been leading a turnaround plan since unretiring from the automaker a year ago.Kuniskis aims to make more than 25 announcements through next year. Thus far they have included returning to NASCAR with mechanical bull rides and a new race truck, resurrecting Hemi V-8 engines with a new \"Symbol of Protest,\" and killing a long-promised battery-electric version of its 1500 truck.The 2027 Ram 1500 SRT TRX will start at $99,995, excluding a mandatory $2,595 destination fee that bumps the price to $102,590. The initial TRX started at $71,690 in 2020, including destination.Ram on Thursday also announced a new 6.7-liter Cummins high-output turbo diesel engine for its 2027 Ram Power Wagon heavy-duty truck with 430 horsepower and 1,075 foot-pounds of torque.Shifting plansMany of the new efforts go against Stellantis' previous plans to discontinue gas V-8 vehicles amid more stringent fuel economy regulations and penalties. But those policies have either been weakened or disappeared under the Trump administration.Kuniskis said the rollback should help sales, but that he was \"going to do it anyway\" regardless of the standards.2027 Ram 1500 SRT TRXStellantis Kuniskis has embraced V-8 engines again, including with resurrecting the TRX, as part of an effort to revive Stellantis' U.S. sales, which plummeted under former Stellantis CEO Carlos Tavares from 2021 to 2024.During that time, the automaker — formed in 2021 through a merger of Fiat Chrysler and PSA Groupe — fell from the No. 4 automaker in U.S. sales to No. 6. Stellantis' sales through the third quarter of last year were 6% lower compared with a year earlier. Cox Automotive expects the automaker to finish the year with 1.25 million sales in the U.S., down 4.4% from 2024 and off from more than 2 million sales in 2020.Kuniskis, who also oversees all of Stellantis' U.S. brands, said both Ram and Jeep — the automaker's most critical domestic brands — are going \"in the right direction\" to capitalize on growth next year.2027 Ram 1500 SRT TRXStellantis That could be more difficult than it has been in the past, as auto forecasters such as Cox expect relatively flat or even falling auto sales in 2026. That means the automaker will have to conquest buyers from other brands.\"It's still a strong industry, so as long as we get our piece of it, we'll be OK,\" Kuniskis said.Jeep reset Ram isn't the only Stellantis brand looking for a revival.Jeep CEO Bob Broderdorf, much like Kuniskis, has been initiating a turnaround strategy for the company's Jeep brand. Jeep has experienced years of annual sales declines since it hit record sales of more than 973,000 vehicles in 2018.The \"Jeep reset\" plan includes repositioning the brand's pricing, models and standard features, according to Broderdorf.\"This is going to be the last piece of the puzzle, I think, to resetting the foundation for Jeep this year and really getting into what makes it special going forward,\" Broderdorf told CNBC during an interview Dec. 16. \"It's a much better Jeep.\"2026 Jeep Recon EVJeepKuniskis described the Jeep reset plan as \"making Jeep more Jeep.\" The most recent actions essentially streamline Jeep's product lineup into fewer models, more content and a pricing strategy with fewer overlaps, from smaller vehicles such as the Compass and Cherokee to the bigger Grand Cherokee and Grand Wagoneer. \"The entire Jeep lineup is better,\" Broderdorf said.  \"I think we're laying a very strong foundation for growth going into next year, plus the new cars.\"New upcoming Jeeps include a resurrected Cherokee midsize SUV as well as an all-electric Recon inspired by the brand's iconic Wrangler off-road SUV.2025 could be the year that Jeep breaks the trend and notches its first U.S. sales increase since 2018, but  Broderdorf said in mid-December that the brand will be close to the goal, so it could go either way.Broderdorf said Jeep remains profitable despite the pricing changes as well as lower sales amid the turnaround plan.\"We're going to grow healthy,\" he said. \"I think this is what the brand needs. We're going to grow.\"Read more CNBC auto newsGM's record stock performance beats Tesla, Ford and other automakers in 2025EV realism is here.

Yum! Brands owns fast-food chains like KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell, and operates them in India through franchise partners such as Devyani International, Sapphire Foods India and Burman Hospitality.The deal would combine the two major franchisee operators for Yum! Brands in India into a single entity, overseeing KFC and Pizza Hut in the country. While Devyani International did not confirm the deal size, Reuters reported that the transaction is valued at $934 million.Under the terms of the merger, Devyani International will issue 117 shares for every 100 equity shares of Sapphire Foods India, the companies said in a press release. Shares of Sapphire Foods India fell as much as 6.4% at the open.The merger is expected to take effect within 12 to 15 months, subject to regulatory and shareholder approval. The companies said the deal would accelerate KFC's expansion in the country and help revitalize Pizza Hut, which trails market leader Domino's by a wide margin.\"India is a high-priority market for us\" said Yum! Brands' chief financial officer Ranjith Roy. He added that the country has abundant room for further growth.The proposed merger would drive accelerated expansion and create \"greater value for both shareholder bases\" through improved supply chain operations, he said.Devyani International, the largest franchisee of Yum! Brands in India, said it expects an annual \"synergies\" of 2.1 billion rupees to 2.2 billion rupees, or about $23 million to $25 million, starting from the second full year after the merger is completed.Devyani operates more than 2,000 quick-service restaurant outlets across more than 280 cities in India, Nigeria, Nepal, and Thailand. Meanwhile, Sapphire operates 529 KFC and 338 Pizza Hut restaurants in India, along with 119 Pizza Hut and 11 Taco Bell restaurants in Sri Lanka, where it the the largest international quick-service restaurant chain.\"India has the potential to become a true crown jewel within Yum!'s global markets, and this announcement represents a significant step in that journey,\" said Sumeet Narang, nominee director at Sapphire Foods India and Founder of private equity firm Samara Capital.India has the third-highest concentration of Yum!Brand stores after the U.S. and China, according to the company's most recent financial report.",

    "body": "Singapore tops the list in the 2025 Global Talent Competitiveness Index by INSEAD and Portulans Institute.Calvin Chan Wai Meng | E+ | Getty ImagesSingapore's economy expanded 5.7% year on year for the fourth quarter, the highest since 2021, driven mainly by a sharp increase in manufacturing output during the three months through December.The Ministry of Trade and Industry said that Singapore's manufacturing sector posted a 15% expansion, a massive jump compared to the 4.9% growth in the third quarter. Growth during the quarter was largely driven by the biomedical manufacturing and electronics clusters, the ministry said.Manufacturing makes up about 20% of the city-state's GDP.Most other sectors contracted during the quarter, including construction and services.The advance estimate was higher than the revised 4.3% growth in the previous quarter, lifting full-year GDP growth to 4.8%, as announced by Prime Minister Lawrence Wong in his New Year's message. The 4.8% growth had surpassed the country's Ministry of Trade and Industry's upgraded forecast of \"around 4%\" in November. \"This is a better outcome than we expected, given the circumstances,\" Wong said, while warning that sustaining the current pace of growth would be challenging.Singapore's MTI had forecast a GDP growth figure of about 1%-3% for 2026. Selena Ling, Chief Economist & Head of Group Research & Strategy at OCBC, said that Singapore's GDP performance \"showcased economic resilience through broad-based and diversified strengths in manufacturing, services, and construction.\"Ling projected GDP growth of about 2% in 2026, assuming manufacturing growth eases to around 2.2% year on year due to a high base in 2025.Singapore had earlier cautioned that 2025 would be challenging, citing trade risks after U.S. President Donald Trump's administration slapped trade tariffs on dozens of countries in his \"Liberation Day\" on April.Despite having a free trade agreement with the U.S. since 2004, Singapore was hit with the 10% baseline tariff. Wong said at the time that \"these are not actions one does to a friend.\"Singapore is highly dependent on trade, with its trade-to-GDP ratio exceeding 320% in 2024, according to data from the World Bank.The country also warned in April last year that zero growth was a possibility and eased monetary policy twice in 2025 to prepare for a slowdown.

The index surpassed the 10,000 threshold at around 8:30 a.m., before paring gains. Analysts told CNBC late last year that while the speed of the FTSE 100′s rise to the 10,000-point level was notable, investors should remain wary. \"Passing any large round number on an index is psychologically important but the foundations for the move have to be solid for the new level to set a floor rather than act as a ceiling for the index,\" said Toni Meadows, head of investment at BRI Wealth Management. The pan-European Stoxx 600 index, meanwhile, rose 0.5%, with most sectors and major bourses in the green. The moves come as investors return from the New Year's Day holiday on Thursday and after stellar annual gains.The Stoxx 600 index rose nearly 16% during 2025, notching its third consecutive year of gains, as it was led higher by banking stocks and a surge in regional defense spending.Looking at individual stocks, shares of Danish energy group Orsted rose 3.6% after the world's largest developer of offshore wind farms said it had challenged the U.S. government's suspension of the lease for its Revolution Wind joint venture and would seek a court injunction. Dutch semiconductor equipment makers Be Semiconductor and ASMI topped the index, up 9.6% and 6.1%, respectively, after the U.S. government granted an annual licence to the world's largest chip manufacturer Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company to import U.S. chip manufacturing equipment to its facilities in Nanjing, China, according to a Thursday Reuters report. CNBC has reached out to TSMC for comment. Larger peer ASML, the most valuable company in Europe, rose 4%.Mining and defense stocks were also among the top performers.

I won't be up there speaking at the annual meeting, but I'll be in the directors' section.\"",

(Photo by Johannes Simon/Getty Images)Johannes Simon | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesBYD sharply declined in December from a year before, as it closed the curtains on a volatile year for China electric vehicles amid an aggressive price war and weak domestic demand.The company recorded 414,784 deliveries in December, down from 474,921 in November, according to a Friday filing.The latest reading brings BYD to hit its 2025 sales target, which it lowered by 16% to 4.6 million, amid increasingly weakening domestic demand.The EV behemoth also remained the clear market leader, delivering more than 4.54 million passenger vehicles for 2025 – a 6.94% increase from its 2024 deliveries. That overshadows Tesla's recorded wholesale deliveries of 735,274 from Model Y and Model 3 vehicles in China, between January and November, based on CNBC's calculation of data from the China Passenger Car Association. December numbers have yet to be released.Affordable models offer edge EV startups posted strong growth in 2025, as mass-market models and aggressive pricing increasingly outperformed premium-focused strategies. Leapmotor emerged as one of the fastest-growing brands, making 596,555 deliveries in 2025, surpassing its target for the year. The automaker, which marked its 10th anniversary last year, nearly doubled its sales volume from 2024 and aims to deliver 1 million EVs in 2026. Xpeng also posted a sharp increase, delivering 429,445 sales for the year – a 126% jump from 2024, the company said Thursday. The automaker's deliveries peaked in September and October following the launch of its Mona series in September. Nio posted 326,028 car deliveries in 2025, recording a 46.9% year-on-year increase, the company said in a Thursday release. About half of its deliveries were attributed to Nio's premium namesake brand. The company also said in the release that it had set a record in China for the fastest delivery among EVs priced above 400,000 yuan ($57,172), with its flagship SUV ES8.Without specifying its annual delivery numbers, Xiaomi recorded more than 50,000 sales in December, marking a new record. According to CNBC calculations of its monthly data, the smartphone maker made more than 380,000 car deliveries in 2025. Li Auto bucks trendBy contrast, Li Auto delivered 406,343 vehicles for the whole of 2025, marking a sharp decline from its record performance in 2024. The company delivered 44,246 vehicles in December, its first monthly total above 40,000 since May. The latest reading marks a recovery in growth since  its sales were hit by a marketing misstep in September, around the launch of its competitively priced Li i8.Meanwhile, Huawei-backed Harmony Intelligent Mobility Alliance – which includes brands such as Aito, Chery, and Maextro – recorded strong momentum, with about 589,107 vehicles delivered for 2025, a 32% year-on-year increase. It clocked 89,611 deliveries in December, marking the third straight month of monthly delivery records, the company said.The company did not specify Aito's delivery figures. ",

Israel's Mossad spy agency issued a direct call on December 31, 2025,urging Iranians to press on with protests, saying it was supporting them \"on the ground\" as demonstrations spread in capital Tehran and other Iranian cities.  Protests began on December 28, 2025, with Tehran shopkeepers rallying against Iran's worsening economy have spread to other cities, drawing in students as well. (Photo by ATTA KENARE / AFP via Getty Images)Atta Kenare | Afp | Getty ImagesPresident Donald Trump said Friday that if Iran \"violently\" intervenes with peaceful protests, then the U.S. will \"come to their rescue.\"Unrest has been growing in Iran since last week, as protests erupted over the government's handling of a sharp fall in the nation's currency and soaring prices. Annual inflation hit 42.2% in December, with food prices jumping 72%. The protests turned violent this week as local media reported the death of at least six civilians.\"If Iran shots and violently kills peaceful protesters, which is their custom, the United States of America will come to their rescue,\" Trump wrote in a post on Truth Social on Friday.\"We are locked and loaded and ready to go,\" he added.Iran's supreme leader adviser Ali Larijani responded by saying that U.S. interference in Iran's protests was equivalent to chaos across the entire region on Friday, in comments reported by Reuters.watch nowSuzanne Maloney, vice president and director of foreign policy at the Brookings Institution, previously said that the Iranian people were calling for not just a fix to the economy, but for regime change. She added that Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has been in power for 36 years.\"We're hearing cries of Death to the dictator. We're hearing slogans that juxtapose the regime's support for militia groups across the region with the real interests and demands of the Iranian people,\" Maloney told CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" on Wednesday.Iran's economy has struggled since Trump pulled the U.S. out of the Iranian nuclear deal in 2018 and re-imposed sanctions on the country. Last year in June, U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear sites escalated tensions, pulling Washington into Israel's war with its longtime regional rival.Earlier this week, Trump threatened additional military action against Iran if the country attempts to build up its reserves of ballistic weapons and reestablish its nuclear program.\"Now, I hear that Iran is trying to build up again, and if they are we're going to have to knock them down. We'll knock them down. We'll knock the hell out of them. But hopefully that's not happening,\" Trump said on Monday.Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian responded on Tuesday in a post on X, saying that the response of the Islamic Republic of Iran to any \"oppressive aggression will be harsh and regrettable.\"  Foreign policy has dominated Trump's schedule in recent weeks. On Tuesday, the U.S. announced sanctions on a group of 10 individuals and entities based in Iran and Venezuela that are allegedly linked to the weapons trade between the two countries.— CNBC's Justin Papp contributed to this report.",

    "body": "File: President Donald Trump looks on after signing an executive order in the Oval Office of the White House on April 9, 2025.Saul Loeb | Afp | Getty ImagesPresident Donald Trump issued the first vetoes of his second term Tuesday, blocking bills that would support a pair of bipartisan infrastructure projects in Colorado and Florida. Trump's veto of the Colorado bill, the Finish the Arkansas Valley Conduit Act, which Congress unanimously approved earlier in December, enraged the state's lawmakers. The bill would reduce the payments local communities must provide to the federal government for the construction of the Arkansas Valley Conduit, a pipeline poised to provide clean drinking water to rural communities in Colorado. In a message to Congress after vetoing the legislation, Trump said the bill would \"continue the failed policies of the past by forcing Federal taxpayers to bear even more of the massive costs of a local water project — a local water project that, as initially conceived, was supposed to be paid for by the localities using it.\"\"Enough is enough. My Administration is committed to preventing American taxpayers from funding expensive and unreliable policies,\" he said. Bipartisan Colorado lawmakers who pushed the bill erupted after the veto, vowing Congress will override it. Some argued that Trump is making good on his vow for retribution after Colorado refused to free Tina Peters, a former Colorado county clerk who was convicted last year of crimes relating to the breach of voting machines after the 2020 election.Trump warned earlier this year in a Truth Social post that if she was not released, he would \"take harsh measures!!!\" Trump issued a pardon for Peters in December, but it was largely symbolic since Peters was convicted in a state court.Read more CNBC politics coverageEuropean Union approves over $105 billion toward Ukraine aid package for next two yearsBrown and MIT prof shooter suspect Neves Valente is found dead, authorities saysTrump Media to merge with fusion company TAE Technologies, DJT stock soarsTrump announces 'warrior dividend' of $1,776 to U.S. soldiers in prime-time speechEpstein accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell petitions to vacate sex crime convictionCongressional stock trading ban bill to get a vote in new year: House RepublicansFBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino is stepping down in JanuaryObamacare subsidies extension to get vote after 4 Republicans buck leadershipFCC chief Carr tells Senate that his agency is 'not formally ... independent'Trump vowed to block tankers carrying Venezuela's oil — nearly a dozen at sea nowKennedy Center to be renamed 'Trump-Kennedy Center,' White House saysTrump vowed to block tankers carrying Venezuela's oil — nearly a dozen at sea nowHouse passes bill to ease permits for building out AI infrastructureTrump sues BBC for $10 billion, claims defamation from Panorama documentaryPentagon takes big stake in new Korea Zinc refinery in Tenn., gets 10% of companyNew Trump tariffs collection hits $200 billion, Customs saysFormer Instacart employee says she was fired over her Democratic congressional campaignUkraine peace talks progressing, Russia open to EU membership, U.S. officials sayNew York AG sues UPS for allegedly shorting Christmas season workers' wagesTrump admin to hire 1,000 specialists for 'Tech Force'Trump doubles down on Rob Reiner criticism after killing; director's son in custodyTSA is giving airline passenger data to ICE for deportation push: NYTTrump's AI order may be 'illegal,' Democrats and consumer advocacy groups claimTrump sued by preservation group seeking to halt White House ballroom projectTrump says 'no big deal' after new Epstein photos showing him releasedPutin can fund war for years, ex-official says as Trump's resolve is testedIndiana redistricting bill that Trump demanded defeated in state SenateHouse passes INVEST Act to ease investment standards, boost capital in marketsDOJ fails again to indict New York AG James, a Trump target: ReportsTrump 'sells out' U.S. national security with Nvidia chip sales to China: WarrenTrump pushes for top prosecutor nominee Halligan after Comey, James cases tossedTrump willing to seize more oil tankers off Venezuela coast: White HouseSeized tanker will go to U.S. port, Trump admin intends 'to seize the oil'GOP lawmakers seek Trump aid for agricultural equipment after tariff pressureTrump says Fed could have 'at least doubled' latest interest rate cut'Spoof' ship: Seized oil tanker hid location, visited Iran and VenezuelaTrump admin touts pulling 9,500 truckers off road for failing English testsSwiss government says new 15% U.S. tariff ceiling retroactive to mid-NovemberHomeland Security Dept. buying Boeing 737s for ICE deportationsTrump officials move to end student loan payment pause for millions of borrowersJudge unseals Ghislaine Maxwell grand jury materials, citing Epstein files actUkraine at 'critical moment' in war as European allies ramp up pressure on RussiaDemocrats establish AI working group as industry bolsters DC presenceEx-Trump lawyer Habba resigns as NJ U.S. attorney after disqualification\"This isn't governing.

I'll keep fighting to get rural Colorado the clean water they deserve.\"Sen. John Hickenlooper, D-Colo., also alleged Trump's veto was partisan. \"Donald Trump is playing partisan games and punishing Colorado by making rural communities suffer without clean drinking water,\" Hickenlooper said on X. \"Congress should swiftly overturn this veto.\"GOP Rep. Lauren Boebert, a staunch Trump ally, said on her X account that \"This isn't over.\"In a statement she gave to Colorado-based NBC-affiliate KUSA, Boebert said she \"hope[s] this veto has nothing to do with political retaliation for calling out corruption and demanding accountability.\"Boebert was one of the Republicans who joined Democrats in compelling the release of files related to notorious sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Trump did not mention Peters in his rationale for vetoing the legislation. On Wednesday, however, he issued a Truth Social post saying, \"God Bless Tina Peters, who is now, for two years out of nine, sitting in a Colorado Maximum Security Prison.\"\"Hard to wish her a Happy New Year, but to the Scumbag Governor, and the disgusting 'Republican' (RINO!) DA, who did this to her (nothing happens to the Dems and their phony Mail In Ballot System that makes it impossible for a Republican to win an otherwise very winnable State!), I wish them only the worst. May they rot in Hell,\" the President wrote.Congress' unanimous passage of the bill suggests it will have the votes to override Trump's veto if GOP leadership in both chambers allows it. Two-thirds of both the House and the Senate would be needed to override the veto.Rep. Jeff Hurd, another Colorado Republican, said in a post to X that he will \"continue fighting for rural Colorado by working across party lines to get this project back on track and ensure our communities are not left behind.\" CNBC has reached out to House Speaker Mike Johnson's office to ask if he will allow the chamber to override the veto. The Florida bill Trump vetoed, the Miccosukee Reserved Area Amendments Act, also passed Congress by voice vote. The bill would have expanded the Miccosukee Reserved Area to include an area known as the Osecola Camp, part of the Everglades National Park. Trump in a message to Congress said he vetoed the bill in part to prevent \"American taxpayers from funding projects for special interests, especially those that are unaligned with my Administration's policy of removing violent criminal illegal aliens from the country.\"In Trump's first term, he vetoed a total of 10 bills. His first veto came in 2019, two years into his term, to overturn a congressional move to end a national emergency at the southern border. Congress failed to override that veto.",

    "body": "©Studio One-one | Moment Unreleased | Getty ImagesDepending on where you live, relying on a postmark to prove you mailed your tax return, mail-in ballot, bill payment or any other time-sensitive document by a specific date may no longer work as you expect.As the U.S. Postal Service continues implementing operational changes in an effort to shore up its finances and modernize its infrastructure, the agency expects an increase in delays between when you mail something and when it is postmarked, according to a public notice in the Federal Register that took effect Dec. 24. A postmark shows the date your mail was processed, and historically has been applied the same day you mail an item. However, due to limiting pickups at many postal locations and mail now often traveling farther to regional processing centers where the postmark is applied, \"the postmark date does not inherently or necessarily align with the date on which the Postal Service first accepted possession of the mailpiece,\" the notice reads.Read more CNBC personal finance coverageUSPS changes may delay postmarks.

Here's who the lapse will hit hardestTrump officials to start garnishing wages of student loan borrowers in JanuaryCNBC's Financial Advisor 100: Best financial advisors, top firms rankedWhile households increasingly use digital options to file taxes, pay bills and handle other personal business, there are still people who use the Postal Service for time-sensitive mail.Of the 163.6 million tax returns received by the IRS this year, about 10 million were not filed electronically, according to the agency's latest data. About 29% of voters mailed in their ballots last year, according to USAFacts. And 13% of households paid their bills by mail last year, according to the Postal Service's 2024 Household Diary Study. \"Consumers have always assumed that the post office will postmark their mail on the day they take it to the post office or drop it in a box,\" said Edgar Dworsky, founder of advocacy site Consumer World and a former assistant attorney general in Massachusetts who focused on consumer protection. \"Who would expect it could be several days before it has a postmark on it?\"Mail is traveling farther to processing facilitiesWhile the Postal Service said in the notice that it is not changing how it postmarks mail — that has always been done at its processing facilities — the agency has added language to its Domestic Mail Manual to clarify for the public when postmarks are applied.In 2021, USPS unveiled an initiative called Delivering for America to improve its financial condition, which included increasing postage prices and redesigning its network and processing operations.Changes to transportation schedules and the consolidation of processing facilities under that initiative mean many post offices that previously sent mail twice a day to a hub now do so only once in the morning, according to new research from the Brookings Institution. Under the new network, roughly 26% of post offices are within 50 miles of their assigned regional center, and another 26% are between 150 and 500 miles away, according to the research.The upshot is that some mail generally doesn't begin moving through the system until at least the following day, resulting in the postmark not being applied the day you mailed that item. In some cases — i.e., ahead of weekends or holidays — it could take longer than a day for that crucial stamp to be applied.How to meet mailing deadlines amid postmark delaysThe importance of ensuring your mail is postmarked in time applies to a range of documents or forms that have deadlines. For example, ballots that are mailed can require a postmark by a specific date to be counted, as can federal and state tax returns and certain legal documents.If someone wants to ensure \"that the postmark aligns with the date of mailing, the customer may take the mailpiece to a post office, station or branch and request a [manual postmark] at the retail counter,\" according to a statement issued by the Postal Service.Asking a postal clerk to manually postmark something costs nothing. Or, you can pay $5.30 to send a time-sensitive document via certified mail, which includes a receipt for the sender as well as a return receipt showing when it was delivered and who signed for it. Alternatively, a certificate of mailing, which you keep for your records, costs $2.40 and shows the date you mailed something.\"Waiting in line at the post office is never fun, but you get that proof of timely mailing,\" said Josh Youngblood, an enrolled agent and founder of The Youngblood Group in Dallas. \"The reality is, otherwise, you are at the mercy of whenever that postmark gets applied.\"Given the possibility of a delay, you may want to explore electronic filing or payment options when available. Or, give yourself a deadline to mail something important well ahead of the official due date.Considerations for mailing tax returnsAhead of tax filing season, it's worth taking note of the possible delay. While April 15 is when federal taxes are due, the IRS considers any tax return postmarked on or before April 15 as being filed on time, even if it's not received until days later.So if you are prone to waiting until the last minute to file taxes and do not do it electronically, you can't assume dropping off your return at the post office or putting it in a mailbox means it will get postmarked that day.\"If I'm mailing something to the IRS, I'm going to go into the post office to the actual person, where they stamp it,\" Youngblood said.If your tax return is postmarked late and you owe taxes, you may face penalties and interest. \"There is a penalty for filing late, and even a day late is still late,\" Youngblood said.For individual tax returns — i.e., your Form 1040 — the penalty for filing a late return is 5% of the tax due for each month or partial month the return is late, capping out at 25%. On top of that, the penalty for paying late is 0.5% of your unpaid balance per month, also capped at 25%. Interest is also charged on unpaid balances, accruing daily at the federal short-term rate plus 3%.However, if you have filed and paid taxes owed on time over the previous three years, you can request that the penalties be waived, Youngblood said.",

    "body": "Cheng Xin | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesDraftKings is acquiring predictions platform Railbird as it prepares to launch a mobile platform in the coming months to be called DraftKings Predictions.Railbird is licensed by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to offer an event contracts exchange. DraftKings targeted the company for its team and proprietary technology. \"We are excited about the additional opportunity that prediction markets could represent for our business,\" DraftKings CEO Jason Robins said in a statement to CNBC. \"We believe that Railbird's team and platform—combined with DraftKings' scale, trusted brand, and proven expertise in mobile-first products—positions us to win in this incremental space.\"Predictions markets allow customers to trade on the outcomes of various events in the worlds of finance, culture and entertainment, which will allow DraftKings to expand beyond its sports betting business. The markets on election outcomes and sports are the most controversial.  Dozens of states, their gaming regulators and tribes are suing or taking other actions to try to prohibit companies from offering trades based on sporting events, because they see it as unlicensed gambling.  Nevada is among the states warning that companies risk losing their gambling licenses if they offer sports in their prediction markets.If DraftKings offers sports events contracts, it's likely to focus only on states that don't offer licensed sports betting, like California and Texas, to avoid running afoul of the states where it offers sports betting.  Additionally, technology exists to prevent those sports trades from being available on tribal lands.  DraftKings also may offer more advanced \"know your customer\" guardrails, a term commonly used to reference identity verification, given its experience in the regulated gambling market.  ",

Sopa Images | Lightrocket | Getty ImagesJapanese exports in September snapped four months of declines, climbing 4.2% year on year, as shipments to Asia saw robust growth, partially offsetting the drop in exports to the U.S.Exports, however, missed Reuters' median estimates of a 4.6% rise.Shipments to Asia climbed 9.2% compared to the same period last year, boosted by a 5.8% jump in exports to mainland China, Japan's largest trading partner rose. Exports to the U.S., Japan's second largest trading partner, dropped 13.3%.Japan's semiconductor exports were a driver of the overall growth in September, rising 12.6% in terms of value year on year.Japan's exports had fallen into negative territory as the country grappled with U.S. tariffs, with its shipments of automobiles to the world's largest economy taking a huge hit. Auto shipments to the U.S. dropped 24.2% in September in terms of value, slightly less compared to the 28.4% drop in August.Tokyo in July clinched a trade deal with Washington, bringing down tariffs on its exports to the U.S. to 15% from the 25% initially proposed by President Donald Trump. The 15% tariffs took effect on Aug. 7.The world's fourth-largest economy saw imports increase 3.3% year on year, reversing course from the 5.2% decline in August and beating the 0.6% growth expected by the Reuters poll.Hirofumi Suzuki, chief FX strategist & head of research at Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation, told CNBC that exports are actually \"not as strong as it appears on the surface,\" citing the impact of a low base last year. He expects external demand to continue to recover, lifting exports growth, but warns that U.S.-China trade tensions have clouded the outlook.Japan's trade data comes a day after the country got its first female prime minister in Sanae Takaichi, after months of political turmoil following electoral losses of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party under former Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba.Takaichi's stance of a loose momentary policy and massive fiscal stimulus is likely to weaken the yen, making Japanese goods more competitive, benefiting exporters — heavyweights on the benchmark Nikkei 225 that hit a record high on Tuesday.SMBC's Suzuki said that even though \"the yen was at quite weak levels against the U.S. dollar last year, we have yet to see a significant surge in exports. Policy factors such as tariffs seem to have a larger impact than FX on exports.\"  The yen hit a low of nearly 150 against the greenback in September, compared with 147 during the same month last year.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconMarkets have priced in the so-called \"Takaichi trade\" since she took the helm of the LDP in September, which has seen the Nikkei rise to record highs and the yen weakening past the 150 mark.The country's economy has held up better than expected, with the second-quarter GDP being revised upward to 0.5% quarter on quarter from 0.3% estimated initially — analysts in a Reuters poll had had estimated 0.1% growth.",

    "body": "Nurphoto | Nurphoto | Getty ImagesHBO Max is the latest streaming services to raise its prices.The streaming giant, owned by Warner Bros. Discovery, announced Tuesday that it is raising prices across all plans. HBO Max's Basic with ads plan is increasing $1 a month to $10.99, the Standard plan is going up $1.50 to $18.49, and Premium is increasing $2 to $22.99. HBO Max last raised prices in June 2024.The price hikes are effective immediately for new subscriptions. Existing monthly subscribers will be notified 30 days in advance of their plan renewing, with the new prices starting on their next billing date on or after November 20, the company said. The updates come as the streaming market becomes increasingly saturated with options — and as other major apps hike their prices. Disney raised the price of its Disney+ plans and bundles last month, Apple hiked the price of Apple TV by 30% in August and Netflix raised its prices early this year.WBD CEO David Zaslav indicated in September that price increases were on the way along with a stricter crackdown on sharing passwords.\"The fact that this is quality, and that's true across our company, motion picture, TV production and streaming quality, we all think that gives us a chance to raise prices,\" Zaslav said at the Goldman Sachs Communacopia + Technology Conference last month. \"We think we're way underpriced.\"As of June 30, WBD said it had 125.7 million paying subscribers to all of its streaming services. That stat includes HBO Max as well as other legacy linear subscribers to HBO, who have access to the streaming service.HBO Max's news comes as its parent company, WBD, undergoes changes of its own. The company announced in June that it plans to split into two public companies by 2026. A streaming and studios company would include its movie properties and HBO Max, while a global networks business would include linear channels like CNN and TNT Sports. At the same time, WBD is fielding takeout interest from companies including Paramount Skydance and said Tuesday it's open to a sale. ",

    "body": "People shop for clothing at a Costco store in Monterey Park, California on November 22, 2022. Frederic J. Brown | Afp | Getty ImagesPrices are rising across the fashion industry – with jackets and outerwear seeing the steepest year-over-year increases, according to a new report from consulting firm AlixPartners published Wednesday. The firm analyzed how much prices have climbed between 2024 and 2025 across nine categories, from swimsuits to dresses. Prices in all of the categories it tracked have risen by an average of $17 year-over-year. Jackets and outerwear saw the largest increase, with prices on average 24% higher, while swimwear saw the smallest hike at 2% on average. As the U.S. starts to cool down and winter approaches, consumers looking for new coats and jackets could be spending a lot more at the register – if they choose to buy. One factor that's weighed on the category is a late start to fall, which typically leads to weak demand for outerwear. Coupled with higher prices, retailers that bet big on outerwear in the fall and winter months might have a harder time moving product, which could lead to inventory challenges in the spring, said Sonia Lapinsky, the head of AlixPartners' global fashion practice and the report's author.\"[Retailers] have a normal discounting cadence that says by late November, early December, you're already starting to put this stuff on sale, on discount, and a consumer may not have even thought about it by then,\" said Lapinsky.\"We've had so many discussions with retailers about the whole flow of their seasons, and some have made decisions to push some product out further because fall is starting to feel more like late summer,\" she added. \"Not all of them have been that reactive. So it's absolutely a cause for concern if they haven't made any adjustments.\"Here's how much prices have risen in the fashion industry by category. ",

    "body": "The Mattel, Inc. logo is displayed outside the headquarters of the toy company known for products including Barbie and Hot Wheels in El Segundo, California on June 8, 2023.Patrick T. Fallon | AFP | Getty ImagesBarbie-maker Mattel posted third-quarter results after the market close on Tuesday that missed analysts' expectations as ongoing global tariffs continue to hamper the toy manufacturer's sales in North America.Shares of the company fell 4% in after hours trading.Here's what Mattel reported for its third quarter compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:Earnings per share: 89 cents adjusted vs. $1.07 expectedRevenue: $1.74 billion vs. $1.83 billion expectedFor the quarter ended September 30, the company reported net income of $278 million, or 88 cents per share, down from $372 million, or $1.09 per share, a year earlier. Adjusting for one-time items, including costs associated with restructuring and certain product recalls, per-share profit was 89 cents.Net sales fell 6% to $1.74 billion, coming in short of Wall Street's expectations.This is the first time in three quarters that the toy giant has missed on both earnings and revenue expectations.In May, Mattel pulled its annual financial targets and said it would increase prices for some products in the U.S. to counter higher input costs due to the Trump administration's tariffs on key trading partners. On Tuesday the company issued full-year guidance that calls for net sales to increase between 1% and 3% and for earnings per share to come in between $1.54 and $1.66.\"While our U.S. business was challenged in the third quarter by industry-wide shifts in retailer ordering patterns, the fundamentals of our business are strong,\" Mattel CEO Ynon Kreiz said in a release. \"Since the beginning of the fourth quarter, orders from retailers in the US have accelerated significantly.\"Tariffs have put pressure on toy manufacturers industry-wide. Approximately half of Mattel's global toy sales come from the U.S., and by the end of the year, less than 40% of Mattel's product will be sourced from China, Kreiz noted on CNBC in May.During the third quarter, sales in North America fell 12%, with the largest year over year declines in the company's infant, toddler and preschool category. International sales meanwhile climbed 3%.Overall, sales for two of Mattel's largest toy brands saw declining sales: Global Barbie sales fell 17% from the same quarter a year earlier, and Fisher-Price sales dropped 19%. The company's global Hot Wheels sales ticked up 8%.Moving forward, Mattel has focused on expanding its entertainment offerings and employing new technology. On Tuesday, Mattel and Hasbro partnered with Netflix to capitalize on the success of the movie \"KPop Demon Hunters\" to offer dolls and other consumer products tied to the film.Mattel is producing dolls, action figures, accessories and playsets and currently is taking pre-orders for a three-pack of dolls featuring Rumi, Mira and Zoey, the members of the fictional KPop trio HUNTR/X. Merchandise and toys from both companies will be available at retail in spring 2026.Correction: Mattel reported net income of $278 million. A previous version of this article misstated the figure. ",

More than 63% of the shares available for trading were sold short, per FactSet.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconBeyond Meat, 1-day performanceIt's a remarkable turnaround for a stock that tumbled more than 67% just last week, after the company announced it has finalized a debt deal. The stock is currently trading around $2 per share, after ending last week at just 65 cents.Indeed, the stock has been under pressure for many years, posting losing returns over each of the last five years. After surging past $230 per share following its IPO in 2019, it has since become a penny stock.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconBYND, all timeYet this week's rally harkens back to when Beyond Meat enjoyed meme stock status among retail traders, who crowded into the stock based more on sentiment than on corporate fundamentals after coordinating on online message boards.In 2021, Bank of America called Beyond Meat a Reddit stock to watch. It ended that same year down more than 47%.watch nowThe return of Beyond Meat could also be the latest sign of a frothy market, as investors pile into more speculative names in spite of elevated valuations, and possibly a signal of a market top.Roundhill actually shut its meme ETF down at one point because of lack of interest, but revived it earlier this month as retail traders dive back into this relentless bull market.",

    "body": "A new Volkswagen ID.3 electric car prepares to pass final inspection at the Volkswagen plant on May 14, 2025 in Dresden, Germany.Sean Gallup | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesGerman auto giant Volkswagen on Wednesday warned of temporary production outages citing China's export restrictions on semiconductors made by Nexperia.The update comes shortly after the German Association of the Automotive Industry (VDA), the country's main car industry lobby, said the China-Netherlands dispute over Nexperia could lead to \"significant production restrictions in the near future\" if the supply interruption of chips cannot be swiftly resolved.A spokesperson for Volkswagen told CNBC by email that while Nexperia is not a direct supplier of the company, some Nexperia parts are used in its vehicle components, which are supplied by Volkswagen's direct suppliers.\"We are in close contact with all relevant stakeholders in light of the current situation to identify potential risks at an early stage and to be able to make decisions regarding any necessary measures,\" a Volkswagen spokesperson said, noting that the firm's production is currently unaffected.\"However, given the evolving circumstances, short-term effects on production cannot be ruled out,\" they added.Shares of Volkswagen traded around 2% lower at 1:15 p.m. London time (8:15 a.m. ET).Last month, the Dutch government took control of Nexperia, a Chinese-owned semiconductor maker based in the Netherlands, in what was seen as a highly unusual move.The Dutch government seized control of the company, which specializes in the high-volume production of chips used in automotive, consumer electronics and other industries, citing fears the firm's tech \"would become unavailable in an emergency.\"China responded by blocking exports of the firm's finished products, sparking alarm among Europe's auto industry.A spokesperson for Germany's Economy Ministry said the government is concerned about chip supply chain difficulties, according to Reuters.— CNBC's Dylan Butts contributed to this report.",

    "body": "Workers demolish the facade of the East Wing of the White House on Oct. 20, 2025 in Washington, DC.Kevin Dietsch | Getty ImagesThe White House on Tuesday dismissed anger over the demolition of parts of the building's East Wing to build a new ballroom at the behest of President Donald Trump.\"In the latest instance of manufactured outrage, unhinged leftists and their Fake News allies are clutching their pearls over President Donald J. Trump's visionary addition of a grand, privately funded ballroom to the White House,\" the White House said in a statement.The White House called the ballroom \"a bold, necessary addition that echoes the storied history of improvements and additions\" by prior presidents.Photos of construction workers tearing down parts of the building went viral online Monday, triggering public anger over the planned 90,000-square-foot, $250 million ballroom.\"You probably hear the beautiful sound of construction to the back,\" Trump said during a Rose Garden event Tuesday. \"That's music to my ears. I love that sound. Other people don't like it. I love it.\"In July, Trump said that construction of the ballroom \"won't interfere with the current building.\"\"It'll be near it but not touching it, and pays total respect to the existing building, which I'm the biggest fan of,\" Trump said of the White House at the time.The Treasury Department has told staff not to share photos of the East Wing, a spokesperson confirmed to CNBC on Tuesday. The department is located next to the White House, and has a clear view of the demolition work.\"Carelessly shared photographs of the White House complex during this process could potentially reveal sensitive items, including security features or confidential structural details,\" the Treasury spokesperson told CNBC.\"Out of an abundance of caution, we have urged our employees to avoid sharing these images.\"The Wall Street Journal first reported Treasury's message to employees.\"Trump's billionaire ballroom. This is a disgrace. Welcome to the Second Gilded Age,\" Rep. Darren Soto, D-Fla., tweeted Monday, above a photo from The Washington Post showing the demolition work.Trump has said that he and private donors will finance the construction of the ballroom.Comcast, the current parent company of CNBC, was on a list of top donors to the ballroom's construction. It is unclear how much Comcast and other donors contributed. CNBC will spin off from Comcast before the end of this year under a new parent company Versant.",

Nadella's total pay for fiscal 2025 climbed 22% to $96.5 million from $79.1 million last year, Microsoft said in a proxy filing after the close of regular trading on Tuesday. That includes more than $84 million in stock awards and over $9.5 million in Nadella's cash incentives.The pay plan is largely tied Microsoft's share performance. So far in 2025, Microsoft's stock price has risen by 23%, topping the S&P 500's 15% gain. The shares have more than doubled in valued over the past three years.Microsoft is scheduled to report results for the fiscal first quarter next week. In its fourth-quarter disclosure in July, the company reported better-than-expected earnings and revenue, with sales climbing 18%, the fastest growth in more than three years. Microsoft Azure business is driving expansion as companies' cloud infrastructure needs grow to meet AI demand. In fiscal 2024, Nadella's pay jumped 63% from 48.5 million the prior year, with 90% of his compensation coming from stock awards. Nadella was eligible for a $10.66 million cash incentive last year, but he asked the board's compensation committee to reduce that number to $5.2 million as a result of a series of cyberattacks that the company endured.Despite Microsoft's strong financial and stock performance, the company has seen turmoil among its workforce in recent months. In July, Nadella penned a memo to employees saying that the company's elimination of more than 15,000 employees in 2025 had \"been weighing heavily\" on him.Microsoft has also terminated several activist employees who protested the company's work with the Israeli military.WATCH: Microsoft is trending toward a $5T market cap, says Wedbush's Dan Iveswatch now",

    "body": "watch nowShares of Netflix were down 7% in extended trading Wednesday after the company posted a third-quarter earnings miss after the bell Tuesday, citing an ongoing dispute with Brazilian tax authorities for the weaker-than-estimated results.The streamer said the specific expense, stemming from a 10% tax on certain payments made by Brazilian entities to operations outside the country, was not previously in its forecast. The company decided to charge the impact to its third quarter after it became reasonably likely that Netflix would lose a legal challenge over whether it would be assessed the tax, executives said.\"It's not a tax that's specific to Netflix. It's not even specific to streaming,\" Chief Financial Officer Spence Neumann said on the company's earnings call. \"Absent this expense, we would have exceeded our Q325 operating income and operating margin forecast, and we don't expect this matter to have a have a material impact on our results going forward.\"Revenue for Netflix's third quarter rose 17%, in line with analyst expectations, boosted by membership growth, pricing adjustments and increased ad revenue. For the fourth quarter, Netflix expects revenue to rise 17% year over year as those trends continue.Here's how the company did in the period ended September 30, compared with estimates from analysts polled by LSEG:Earnings per share:  $5.87 vs. $6.97, according to LSEGRevenue: $11.51 billion vs. $11.51 billion, according to LSEGNetflix reported third-quarter net income of $2.55 billion, or $5.87 per share, up from $2.36 billion, or $5.40, in the same quarter a year prior.For the full-year, Netflix is projecting $45.1 billion in revenue, a 16% jump from the year prior and in line with previous expectations of revenue growth of between 15% and 16%.The company did alter its operating margin forecast for the year, citing the Brazilian tax matter, and now expects that metric to be 29% instead of the prior projection of 30%.Still, Netflix said it posted its best ad sales quarter ever during the period, with co-CEO Greg Peters noting that the company is on track to more than double ad revenue this year.\"Netflix had its best ad sales quarter to date, but still did not provide a figure for how large the ad business is,\" said Ross Benes, senior analyst at EMarketer, in a statement. \"This gives the impression that the sustained revenue growth achieved this quarter, and forecasted for next quarter, will predominantly continue to come from subscription fees.\"Netflix raised its prices in January, including the cost of its ad-supported tier.The streamer's fourth-quarter slate of content contains a number of alluring titles, from the fifth and final season of \"Strangers Things\" and new seasons of \"The Diplomat\" and \"Nobody Wants This\" to Guillermo del Toro's \"Frankenstein\" and Rian Johnson's \"Wake Up Dead Man: A Knives out Mystery.\"Netflix is also still riding the coattails of \"KPop Demon Hunters,\" which was released on the platform back in June. The animated film has become Netflix's most-watched film with more than 325 million views on the platform.Netflix announced Tuesday it's expanding the animated film's consumer reach with a dual product partnership with leading toy companies Hasbro and Mattel. \"KPop Demon Hunters\" dolls, plush, roleplay items and themed games will be available at retail in spring 2026. The company also noted that it is looking into incremental opportunities related to live experiences, publishing, beauty and lifestyle as well as food and beverages related to the film. \"KPop Demon Hunters\" is returning to theaters once again during the Halloween holiday weekend.",

    "body": "An aerial view of residential homes, many with solar panels, on Sept. 17, 2025 in Fontana, California. Mario Tama | Getty ImagesMortgage rates last week dropped to the lowest level in a month, pushing more borrowers to refinance. Potential homebuyers, however, were not as enthused.The average contract interest rate for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages with conforming loan balances, $806,500 or less, decreased last week to 6.37% from 6.42%, with points falling to 0.59 from 0.61, including the origination fee, for loans with a 20% down payment.As a result, applications to refinance a home loan, which are most sensitive to weekly changes in interest rates, rose 4% for the week and were 81% higher than the same week one year ago, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association's seasonally adjusted index. The rate on the 30-year fixed was 15 basis points higher a year ago. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.\"The refinance index increased 4 percent, driven by a 6 percent increase in conventional refinances and a 12 percent increase in FHA refinance applications, as borrowers remain attentive to these opportunities to lower their monthly mortgage payment. VA refinances bucked the trend and were down 12 percent,\" said Joel Kan, an MBA economist, in a release.Kan noted that demand for adjustable-rate mortgages rose again.\"ARM applications increased 16 percent over the week, which pushed the ARM share to 11 percent, with the ARM rate more than 80 basis points lower than the 30-year fixed rate,\" he added.Get Property Play directly to your inboxCNBC's Property Play with Diana Olick covers new and evolving opportunities for the real estate investor, delivered weekly to your inbox.Subscribe here to get access today.ARM applications usually rise when overall interest rates climb, not when they fall. This increase speaks more to currently high home prices than it does to rates. Buyers are doing everything then can to afford what's available.Applications for a mortgage to purchase a home dropped 5% for the week and were 20% higher than the same week one year ago. Buyers are finding more supply on the market, and prices are starting to soften slightly in some areas, but there are those who are waiting, expecting rates to come down even further.And mortgage rates did come down even more to start this week, according to a separate survey from Mortgage News Daily.\"Some lenders are offering their lowest rates in over a year, and some in over 3 years,\" wrote Matthew Graham, chief operating officer at MND, although there was no particular reason for the drop.",

    "body": "Customers check out at a supermarket on August 12, 2025 in New York City. Liao Pan | China News Service | Getty ImagesThe September consumer price index report coming out Friday will command full attention from financial markets, even as some investors will view the data with a skeptical eye.With the Bureau of Labor Statistics already under scrutiny this year for its broad menu of data releases, the government shutdown gripping Washington, D.C., will only raise concerns from parts of Wall Street about whether the inflation reading will present a full picture.\"Skeptics like me are going to be focused on how clean is this data,\" said Vishal Khanduja, head of broad markets fixed income at Morgan Stanley Investment Management. \"What were the accommodations made for the lack of full personnel staff showing up? What adjustments were made before the data got reported?\"Indeed, the BLS this year has faced a host of questions over its data collection methods. President Donald Trump in August, furious over huge downward revisions in nonfarm payrolls data, sacked former BLS Commissioner Erika McEntarfer.watch nowThough still considered part of the \"gold standard\" U.S. economic data collection apparatus, the BLS has also been criticized for its decidedly analog approach, which includes in-person visits, phone calls and written response forms.The agency faces the added burden of staffing cuts — even before the shutdown — and has eliminated several cities from its collection efforts. Now, it is putting together a key inflation report with most of the government closed and risks that sample data could be incomplete.For those reasons, Khanduja thinks investors should be careful with how much emphasis they place on the CPI reading.\"The efficacy and the cleanliness of data — there will definitely be a little bit of a skepticism had from my end, and I'm thinking the market will do the same,\" he said.Muted expectationsEven with the questions over the data, economists aren't looking for anything dramatic from the actual numbers.The Dow Jones consensus has the CPI report showing 3.1% annual inflation levels on both the headline, or all-items, gauge as well as the core, which excludes food and energy. Economists see the monthly headline number rising 0.4% and 0.3% for core, right in line with the August gains.What gives this report an even higher profile is that all other data collections and releases have been suspended during the shutdown. The reason the Labor Department called back BLS staffers is because the CPI report is used to index Social Security cost-of-living adjustments.So outside of this, there will be no other releases, leaving investors as well as Federal Reserve policymakers flying blind on data. That in itself presents a bevy of problems and another headache for agencies like the BLS.\"As the shutdown appears likely to last into November, it is not clear how the BLS will deal with an unprecedented lack of real-time collections,\" Citigroup economist Veronica Clark said in a note. \"November data collections are also increasingly likely to be affected. We will be watching for any possible release of guidance on October CPI collections with Friday's September report.\"In the meantime, the Fed will hold a meeting next week, with markets widely expecting a quarter percentage point reduction in the overnight borrowing rate, likely to be followed by another in December. Fed funds currently stand at 4.00% to 4.25%.However, there's considerable uncertainty about what will happen in 2026 and beyond. Trump wants rates aggressively lower, and he's likely to nominate a candidate next year to succeed Chair Jerome Powell with that philosophy.With a lack of data certainty, though, formulating policy will be difficult.\"I don't think we're going to learn a whole lot from this [CPI] data that we're not seeing at the moment,\" Mike Wilson, chief investment officer at Morgan Stanley, said Tuesday on CNBC. \"I think it will give the Fed cover to do what I think they need to do, which is cut rates in a more meaningful way. To me, that [is] the risk, that we don't get the data that allows the Fed to cut more meaningfully.\"",

Chevrolet Silverado truck at a dealership in Upland, California, US, on Wednesday, Oct 15, 2025.Kyle Grillot | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesDETROIT — General Motors raised its 2025 financial guidance Tuesday after beating Wall Street's top- and bottom-line earnings expectations for the third quarter, while lowering its expected impact from tariffs.GM stock rose more than 15% in trading Tuesday. The stock, which closed Monday at $58 per share, had its best day since 2020 and its second best day on the market since its 2009 emergence from bankruptcy.Here's how the company performed in the third quarter, compared with average estimates compiled by LSEG:Earnings per share: $2.80 adjusted vs. $2.31 expectedRevenue: $48.59 billion vs. $45.27 billion expectedAdjusted EBIT: $3.38 billion vs. $2.72 billion expectedGM's third-quarter revenue of $48.59 billion was down less than 1% from $48.76 billion in the same period last year. Adjusted earnings exclude one-time or special items, some interest and taxes as well as other financials not considered \"core\" to the company's operations. GM's new outlook signals strength for the automaker heading into the fourth quarter and beats Wall Street analysts' current expectations for the last three months of the year.The updated guidance includes adjusted earnings before interest and taxes of between $12 billion and $13 billion, or $9.75 to $10.50 adjusted EPS, up from $10 billion to $12.5 billion, or $8.25 to $10 adjusted EPS, and adjusted automotive free cash flow of $10 billion to $11 billion, up from $7.5 billion to $10 billion.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconGM stock in 2025The automaker's new EPS target suggests fourth-quarter adjusted EPS of between $1.64 and $2.39, with a midpoint around $2.02, which is above current consensus of $1.94.\"Thanks to the collective efforts of our team, and our compelling vehicle portfolio, GM delivered another very good quarter of earnings and free cash flow,\" GM CEO Mary Barra said Tuesday in a shareholder letter. \"Based on our performance, we are raising our full-year guidance, underscoring our confidence in the company's trajectory.\"GM also reduced the expected impact of tariffs this year to between $3.5 billion and $4.5 billion, down from $4 billion to $5 billion. The automaker expects to offset about 35% of that impact.Barra on Tuesday thanked President Donald Trump for \"the important tariff updates\" Friday that included imposing levies on imported medium- and heavy-duty trucks and parts as well as extending a tariff offset worth 3.75% of the value of American-made vehicles.Read moreEV impactGM's adjusted results do not include $1.6 billion in special charges reported by the automaker last week due to its pullback in all-electric vehicles, which more than halved its net income attributable to stockholders compared with the third quarter of 2024.The company's net income attributable to stockholders was $1.3 billion during the just-reported period, down 57% from roughly $3.1 billion a year earlier. Its net income margin also plummeted to 2.7%, down from 6.3% a year earlier.GM CFO Paul Jacobson on Tuesday said only about 40% of the company's EVs were profitable on a production, or contribution-margin basis. He signaled that the company expects profitability for EVs to take longer than previously expected amid an expected slowdown in adoption.\"We continue to believe that there is a strong future for electric vehicles, and we've got a great portfolio to be competitive, but we do have some structural changes that we need to do to make sure that we lower the cost of producing those vehicles,\" he told CNBC's Phil LeBeau during \"Squawk Box.\"GM has made significant gains in EV sales this year. Motor Intelligence reported that the Detroit automaker went from an 8.7% market share to begin this year to 13.8% through the third quarter – topping Hyundai Motor, including Kia, at 8.6% through September. GM still trails U.S. EV leader Tesla by a wide margin.NA business downGM's North American business, which has driven its profits this decade, earned more than $2.5 billion during the third quarter, on an adjusted basis. Its adjusted profit margin declined from 9.7% a year earlier to 6.2% during the most recent quarter.Barra said in Tuesday's letter that the automaker's \"top priority\" is to return to 8% to 10% adjusted profit margins in North America through \"driving EV profitability, maintaining production and pricing discipline, managing fixed costs, and further reducing tariff exposure.\"Gains in the company's China operations, up $217 million from a year earlier, as well as its international markets, up $184 million, helped offset the lower North American earnings during the third quarter.GM Financial, the automaker's lending arm, also reported adjusted earnings of $804 million, up 17% from the third quarter of 2024.",

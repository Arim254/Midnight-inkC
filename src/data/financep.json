    "body": "After years of steep increases, renters are finally seeing sustained price relief, a trend that appears to be carrying into early 2026.In November, the median asking rent across the 50 largest U.S. metro areas was $1,693, down about 1% from a year earlier and marking the 28th consecutive month of year-over-year declines, according to Realtor.com listings data. Nationally, the median rent fell to $1,367, down 1.1% from a year earlier, according to Apartment List's data.November is typically the slowest month for rentals, but rents fell more from October to November this year than they did over the same period last year, according to Apartment List.With new apartment supply still hitting the market, rents are expected to remain lower into 2026.\"Barring a major economic shock, 2026 is shaping up to be one of the more renter-friendly periods we've seen in a decade,\" says Michelle Griffith, a luxury real estate broker at Douglas Elliman.Why rents are coolingRent relief comes after a sharp run-up in prices earlier in the decade. Prices for one- and two-bedroom rentals were rising at an annual pace above 12% in mid-2021 and mid-2022 amid high demand, according to Realtor.com data. Since early 2023, rent growth has turned negative as a surge of new apartment supply entered the market.In 2024, more than 600,000 new multifamily apartment units — typically large, managed apartment buildings — were completed nationwide, the most in a single year since the 1980s, according to Apartment List.The biggest rent cuts have shown up in these buildings, where the surge of supply has forced landlords to compete for tenants.\"We're seeing price wars within buildings, longer days on market, and the need for multiple price reductions just to generate foot traffic,\" says Jaclyn Bild, a real estate broker associate at Douglas Elliman. Prices for detached homes and higher-end rentals have held more steady, with demand remaining relatively strong, she says.Where rents are falling the mostRent relief hasn't been uniform, as conditions vary widely by market. The sharpest declines have occurred in fast-growing Sun Belt and interior Western metros with a surge in new housing supply in recent years—especially Austin.These 10 cities recorded some of the steepest year-over-year drops in median asking rent in November, using data for the 50 largest U.S. metro areas, according to Realtor.com.Austin–Round Rock–San Marcos, Texas: −6.6%Denver–Aurora–Centennial, Colorado: −4.8%Birmingham, Alabama: −4.6%Jacksonville, Florida: −4.2%Phoenix–Mesa–Chandler, Arizona: −4.0%San Diego–Chula Vista–Carlsbad, California: −3.5%Las Vegas–Henderson–North Las Vegas, Nevada: −3.0%Houston–Pasadena–The Woodlands, Texas: −2.7%Miami–Fort Lauderdale–West Palm Beach, Florida: −2.7%San Antonio–New Braunfels, Texas: −2.7%While rents remain well above pre-pandemic levels, the momentum has shifted in many markets.High vacancies and a wave of new apartments still coming onto the market are expected to keep rent growth limited into early 2026, with prices leveling off later in the year rather than rebounding quickly, according to Apartment List.\"This is a good time to negotiate rather than assume the asking rent is fixed,\" says Griffith. \"Landlords are far more open to concessions, flexible lease terms, or modest rent reductions than they were even a year ago. Locking in a lease during periods of elevated supply, especially in late winter or early spring, can provide cost certainty before demand picks up again.\"Want to give your kids the ultimate advantage?

    "body": "US President Donald Trump, flanked by Navy Secretary John Phelan (R), announces the US Navy's new Golden Fleet initiative, unveiling a new class of frigates, at Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach, Florida, on December 22, 2025. Andrew Caballero-Reynolds | Afp | Getty ImagesOn Monday, U.S. President Donald Trump unveiled plans for a new \"Trump-class\" battleship, declaring it would be \"the fastest, the biggest, and by far, 100 times more powerful than any battleship ever built.\" He hailed the ships as \"some of the most lethal surface warfare ships,\" promising they would \"help maintain American military supremacy [and] inspire fear in America's enemies all over the world.\"But there is one glaring problem: battleships have been obsolete for decades. The last was built more than 80 years ago, and the U.S. Navy retired the last Iowa-class ships nearly 30 years ago. Once symbols of naval might with their massive guns, battleships have long since been eclipsed by aircraft carriers and modern destroyers armed with long-range missiles.While labeling the new surface combatants as \"battleships\" could be a misnomer, defense experts say that there remain several gaps between Trump's vision and modern naval warfare.Mark Cancian, a senior adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, dismissed the idea, writing in a Dec. 23 commentary that \"there is little need for said discussion because this ship will never sail.\" He contended the program would take too long to design, cost far too much and run counter to the Navy's current strategy of distributed firepower.\"A future administration will cancel the program before the first ship hits the water,\" Cancian said.Bernard Loo, senior fellow at Singapore's S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies, described the proposal as \"a prestige project more than anything else.\" He compared it to Japan's World War II super-battleships Yamato and Musashi — the largest ever built — which were sunk by carrier-borne aircraft before playing a significant role in combat.Photograph of the IJN Yamato, the lead ship of the Yamato class of battleships that served with the Imperial Japanese Navy during World War II. Dated 1941. (Photo by: Photo12/Universal Images Group via Getty Images)Photo 12 | Universal Images Group | Getty Images\"Historically, we looked at battleships and the bigger the better... [and] in a very layman's perspective of strategy, size matters,\" Loo said. He added that the size of the proposed battleship — displacing more than 35,000 tons and measuring more than 840 feet, or a little over two football fields long — would make it a \"bomb magnet.\"\"The size and the prestige value of it all make it an even more tempting target, potentially for your adversary,\" Loo said.Bryan Clark, a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute, suggested Trump may be drawn to the symbolic power of battleships, which were the most visible icons of naval firepower for much of the 20th century.The USS Missouri, completed in 1944 and the last U.S. battleship built, famously hosted Japan's surrender in 1945.Japanese surrender signatories arrive aboard the USS Missouri to participate in surrender ceremonies, Tokyo Bay, Japan, U.S. Army Signal Corps, September 2, 1945. (Photo by: Circa Images/GHI/Universal History Archive/Universal Images Group via Getty Images)Universal History Archive | Universal Images Group | Getty ImagesClark noted that the U.S. Navy recommissioned four World War II battleships in the 1980s as part of its 600-ship fleet expansion strategy during the Cold War to counter the Soviet Union. \"This may be an era in which the president believes the U.S. last had naval supremacy.\"Battleships last saw combat in 1991, when retrofitted Iowa-class battleships provided shore bombardment fire support to coalition forces in the first Gulf War.The battleship USS Wisconsin (BB-64) launches a BGM-109 Tomahawk missile against a target in Iraq during Operation Desert Storm. (Photo by © CORBIS/Corbis via Getty Images)Historical | Corbis Historical | Getty ImagesWhat's in a name?Clark noted that the classification matters less than the weapons a ship carries.According to the U.S. Navy, the Trump-class battleship — part of a new \"golden fleet\" of warships — will be equipped with weapons such as conventional guns and missiles, as well as electronic rail guns and laser-based weaponry. It will also be able to carry nuclear and hypersonic missiles.Such a vessel would essentially function like a large destroyer, regardless of whether it is called a battleship.However, CSIS' Cancian countered that such a design runs against the Navy's distributed operations model, which seeks to reduce vulnerability by spreading firepower across many assets. \"This proposal would go in the other direction, building a small number of large, expensive, and potentially vulnerable assets,\" he wrote.Even if the Trump-class battleship proves technically feasible, analysts said cost would be the decisive obstacle.Loo said U.S. weapons programs routinely exceed timelines and budgets.The Navy's Zumwalt‑class destroyers — the largest surface combatants currently at 15,000 tons — were reduced from 32 to three ships due to spiraling costs. More recently, the Constellation‑class frigate was canceled due to design and workforce challenges.Clark estimated the Trump‑class would cost two to three times more than today's destroyers. With Arleigh Burke destroyers priced at about $2.7 billion each, that implies a single battleship could cost upward of $8 billion.The cost of crewing and maintaining them will put more pressure on an already strained Navy budget, he added.RSIS' Loo was more critical in his assessment, calling the decision a strategic mistake. \"At the very least, as far as I'm concerned, it's strategic hubris.\"",

    "body": "I spent seven years studying high-achieving students, interviewing hundreds of them and their families.Many young people I met described monitoring grades, rankings, and résumés as if they were constantly evaluating their worth. In some families, achievement took on an outsized role, leading some children to wonder whether their parents' love was tied to how well they performed.Achievement culture promises to open doors, suggesting that better grades and better college degrees guarantee better futures. But a growing body of research shows that this relentless chase can breed perfectionism, a trait linked to higher rates of anxiety and depression.So what can a parent do to protect against this narrow view of success and self-worth? We can help young people turn their self-focused attention outward. When children shift from \"How am I doing?\" to \"Where can I be useful?\" they develop a stronger identity, rooted in contribution rather than performance. Small, everyday ways of being needed — helping a neighbor, being counted on at home, showing up for a team — can buffer against that harmful inner-scorekeeping and build a sturdier sense of self-worth.When kids anchor their efforts in something beyond themselves, everyday stressors become more manageable. They stop believing they are only a grade or a score, and start feeling like a person who matters in the world. Here's how:1. Help kids notice genuine needs around them Recently, a woman told me she was on her way to the park with her two young kids when she saw their elderly neighbor raking her lawn. The neighbor waved off the woman's offer to help, but still, she unloaded her kids from the car, and they grabbed rakes, piling leaves into bags.The kids talked about it all afternoon — how happy their neighbor was, how much fun they had, and how good it felt to be useful. They were experiencing what psychologists call a \"helper's high\" and a growing sense of agency.To help children look beyond themselves, try prompts like \"What do you think she might need today?\" or \"Who could use a hand right now?\" Regular acts, such as checking on a neighbor, delivering a meal, and volunteering, strengthen kids' sense of belonging within their community.2. Build contribution into daily routinesOne mother I interviewed taped a sheet of paper to the front door with a short list of family tasks. When her kids came home from school, she'd ask them to sign the ones they could take on that day. Over time, these small commitments helped her children see themselves not just as children who sometimes help, but as contributors to their family.That shift toward a helper identity matters. In a study of 149 children ages 3 to 6, researchers found that thanking children for \"being a helper\" rather than \"helping\" significantly increased their willingness to pitch in. They were motivated by the idea of becoming someone who helps. Across studies, people who feel useful and connected show lower stress and greater resilience, suggesting that contribution is protective.3. Make the invisible work of care visibleKids learn generosity by watching us. But modeling alone isn't enough. We have to make our thinking visible. When you check on a neighbor, bring soup to a sick friend, or help someone who looks overwhelmed, narrate the \"why\" behind your actions. You might say, \"I brought her soup so she knows she's not alone.\" Or, you might explain, \"He looked like he needed a hand with those bags,\" or, \"I texted her because I had a feeling today might be hard.\" These small explanations give kids a mental model of why we help and an internal script they can use themselves.In a culture that too often reduces young people to what they achieve, helping them look outward is one of the most potent antidotes we have to excessive pressure. When young people discover ways to contribute that aren't tied to external metrics, they gain a more grounded sense of who they are and the larger role they can play in the world.Jennifer Breheny Wallace is an award-winning journalist and author of the New York Times bestseller \"Never Enough: When Achievement Culture Becomes Toxic — and What We Can Do About It.\" She lives in New York City with her husband and three teens. You can follow her on Instagram @jenniferbrehenywallace. Want to give your kids the ultimate advantage? Sign up for CNBC's new online course, How to Raise Financially Smart Kids.

Emails sent to the old address will continue to arrive in the inbox, and the original address will still work for signing in to Google services like Drive, Maps and YouTube. Previously, users seeking a new Gmail address had to create a new account and transfer their data manually through a complicated and fraught process that could disrupt integrations with third-party apps.Google said existing data, including photos, messages and emails would remain unchanged after an address update. Users can also reuse the old Google account email address at any time, according to a Google translation of the support page in Hindi.However, accounts that change their Gmail address won't be able to create another new Gmail address for the next 12 months and cannot delete the new chosen address. Google has not issued a formal press release or announcement about the change, which was reportedly first discovered within user forums and tech communities.",

    "body": "A Chevron gas station in San Francisco, California, US, on Tuesday, Oct. 28, 2025. Jason Henry | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesHeading into 2026, investor focus could shift from fixed-income instruments to attractive dividend stocks, given a lower interest rate backdrop. Picking the right names from a vast universe of dividend-paying companies is a challenging task. Tracking the stock picks of top Wall Street analysts can help investors make the right choices, as these experts assign their ratings after conducting a thorough analysis of a company's fundamentals.Here are three dividend-paying stocks, highlighted by Wall Street's top pros, as tracked by TipRanks, a platform that ranks analysts based on their past performance.ChevronOil and gas giant Chevron (CVX) is this week's first dividend pick. The company returned $6 billion of cash to shareholders in the third quarter via $3.4 billion in dividends and $2.6 billion in share repurchases. With a quarterly dividend of $1.71 per share (annualized dividend of $6.84 per share), Chevron offers a yield of about 4.5%.Following meetings with Chevron's management, Piper Sandler analyst Ryan Todd reiterated a buy rating on CVX stock with a price target of $178. Interestingly, TipRanks' AI Analyst is also bullish on the energy company, with an \"outperform\" rating and a price target of $164.Todd noted that while the ongoing scenario of an unfavorable crude backdrop and positive refining business has affected Chevron's performance, his meetings with the management reflected the company's solid position.The analyst contends that Chevron's capital efficiency is underappreciated. Notably, the company's upstream capital expenditure/boe (barrel of oil equivalent) produced is 29% below the peer average. He added that given the declining capex and operating expenses, the benefits from artificial intelligence (AI) that have yet to materialize, and a resource base that is better than feared, Chevron's free cash flow (FCF) annual growth outlook of 10% per year seems conservative.Additionally, Todd argued that \"while investors may continue to worry about TCO [Tengizchevroil joint venture] contract extensions, lingering post-2030 resource depth questions are misguided.\" In this matter, the analyst noted that aside from the projects included in Chevron's official plan, management is upbeat about additional opportunities presented by improved global access (especially in the Middle East), a rise in exploration activities, and expansion and technology-driven prospects.Todd ranks No. 868 among more than 10,200 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been profitable 58% of the time, delivering an average return of 8.5%. See Chevron Ownership Structure on TipRanks. Darden RestaurantsRestaurant company Darden Restaurants (DRI) owns a portfolio of brands, including Olive Garden, LongHorn Steakhouse and Yard House. It recently announced a quarterly dividend of $1.50 per share, payable on Feb. 2, 2026. At an annualized dividend of $6 per share, DRI offers a yield of 3.2%.Following the company's mixed results for the second quarter of fiscal 2026, BTIG analyst Peter Saleh reiterated a buy rating on Darden stock with a price target of $225. In comparison, TipRanks' AI Analyst has a price target of $218 with an \"outperform\" rating.Saleh noted that Darden posted a mixed, but \"mostly positive,\" quarter, with better-than-anticipated comparable sales fueled by improved traffic at the company's major brands.\"Its strategy of under-pricing inflation, leaning on delivery, and offering a desirable menu resonated with guests, driving another quarter of sizable industry outperformance,\" said Saleh.The five-star analyst highlighted that high beef prices continued to be a headwind and weighed on the quarter's restaurant margins and earnings per share (EPS). That said, Saleh is optimistic about Darden achieving its guidance, as beef costs appear to have peaked, labor cost pressures are easing, and management is relying slightly on price increases to offset commodity costs.Overall, Saleh continues to be impressed by the momentum in Darden's sales, and although earnings haven't kept pace yet, they are expected to improve going forward.Saleh ranks No. 641 among more than 10,200 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been profitable 61% of the time, delivering an average return of 10.5%. See Darden Restaurants Statistics on TipRanks. Ares CapitalThis week's third dividend pick is Ares Capital (ARCC), a specialty finance company that provides direct loans and other investments to private middle-market companies. The company announced a dividend of 48 cents per share, payable on Dec. 30, 2025. At an annualized dividend per share of $1.92, ARCC stock offers a yield of 9.5%.In his latest research note on business development companies (BDCs), RBC Capital analyst Kenneth Lee called Ares Capital one of his favorite BDC names for 2026 and reaffirmed a buy rating with a price target of $23. TipRanks' AI Analyst has assigned an \"outperform\" rating to ARCC stock with a price target of $24.While Lee is less constructive on the BDC space heading into 2026 due to a potential decline in net interest income (NII) and return on equity (ROE) from lower base rates, he remains bullish on Ares Capital. In particular, he cited management's confidence in sustaining dividends at current levels despite expectations of lower base rates.Among the key strengths, Lee noted ARCC's dominant position in the BDC market, its extensive scale, and strong originations in the Ares direct lending platform. He also highlighted Ares Capital's more than 20 years of experience.\"In our view, ARCC's dividends are well supported by the company's core earnings per share generation plus potential net realized gains,\" said Lee to support his bullish stance.Lee ranks No. 341 among more than 10,200 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been successful 66% of the time, delivering an average return of 11.5%. See Ares Capital Insider Trading Activity on TipRanks. ",

Silver's recent surge was driven by speculative buying and lingering supply tightness, said experts. Sprott Asset Management said silver's rally this year reflects a depletion of freely traded inventory, amplifying price moves as demand increases.\"Silver continues to price in the more favorable 2026 macro-outlook, with lower interest rates and the potential for a weaker U.S. dollar boosting the appeal for hard assets,\" said Trevor Yates, senior investment analyst at Global X ETFs.U.S. equity futures were flat in early Asian hours.

    "body": "This summer, Switch 2 became the fastest-selling console in Nintendo's history, selling 10.36 million units in the first four months of salesGuillaume Payen | Sopa Images | Lightrocket | Getty ImagesIt has been a monumental year for the video game industry, marked by new devices and billion-dollar deals.Further consolidation occurred within the sector when a consortium led by the Public Investment Fund of Saudi Arabia, alongside Jared Kushner's Affinity Partners and Silver Lake, announced plans to take Electronic Arts private. The $55 billion deal, which includes $20 billion in debt financing, is the largest leveraged buyout in Wall Street history.The move could have major implications for EA, according to Omdia analysts. They said the question now is whether the PIF plans to run EA as a \"PR project\" or \"to extract maximum returns\" from the company. French game developer Ubisoft looked to turn its fortunes around this year, although it started 2025 with a second delay to the latest entry in its flagship Assassin's Creed series, Shadows.Ubisoft's shares received a boost in March after announcing the creation of a new gaming subsidiary with Chinese tech giant Tencent called Vantage Studios. The new developer, which will be part-owned by Tencent, will focus on Ubisoft's key IP — Far Cry, Assassin's Creed, and Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six.watch nowDespite Ubisoft's efforts, shares have lost just over half of their value year to date, and the stock is down over 90% from its 2021 high.In contrast, Take-Two Interactive's shares continued to climb throughout 2025, as anticipation mounted for the next Grand Theft Auto title. It's been 12 years since the previous edition, GTA 5, was released on Xbox 360 and PS3.However, with radio silence on GTA 6 for most of the year, fans speculated that an additional delay from the May 26, 2026, release date was on the cards, despite Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick telling CNBC in May that he had a \"very, very high conviction\" the scheduled date would be achievable. In November this year, the game was pushed back to Nov. 19, 2026, with shares in Take-Two tumbling on the news.The game will launch in the twilight window for Sony's PlayStation 5 and Microsoft's Xbox Series X and S — six years after both consoles were released. As focus shifts to the next generation of consoles, this past generation has seen a change in strategy for both brands. Console strategies shiftXbox has moved away from exclusive games, with titles such as Indiana Jones, Forza Horizon, and more releasing on PS5, while PlayStation continues to experiment further with releasing titles on PC. Take-Two's Zelnick argued that the shifting strategies will see the video game industry become more open. When asked whether the console will be in business within the next five to 10 years, he said the consoles will still be around, with the devices moving towards PC as \"business is moving towards open rather than closed.\"\"But if you define console as the property, not the system, then the notion of a very rich game that you engage in for many hours, that you play on a big screen, that's never going away,\" he told CNBC's Andrew Ross Sorkin in November.Consoles still have a huge role to play in the market, according to George Jijiashvili, senior principal analyst for Games at Omdia. He told CNBC's \"Squawk Box Europe\" that the devices are still \"the go-to place for premium games.\"Data from Omdia shows that consoles are the second-largest category when it comes to total consumer spend, with mobile spend contributing 60%, consoles reaching 23%, and PCs hitting 16%. While others mostly abandoned exclusive titles, Nintendo has continued to pursue the strategy, releasing several exclusive titles for its new Switch 2 console – including an open-world reimaging of Mario Kart and a brand-new Donkey Kong game. This summer, Switch 2 became the fastest-selling console in history, selling 10.36 million units in the first four months of sales.Not all are convinced by Nintendo's strategy. Christopher Dring, founder and editor-in-chief of The Game Business, told CNBC's \"Built for Billions\" in November that Nintendo faces a challenge in maintaining demand for its systems.\"Unlike PlayStation and Xbox and other platforms, the people buying Nintendo machines are buying it for Nintendo games. What that means is, if they don't have a game ready, they can not rely on other developers to prop them up.\"",

Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, confer during the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies hearing titled Fiscal Year 2022 Budget Request for The Environmental Protection Agency, in Dirksen Building on Wednesday, June 9, 2021. Tom Williams | Cq-roll Call, Inc. | Getty ImagesThe Department of Justice on Wednesday said more than one million additional documents potentially related to the disgraced sex offender Jeffrey Epstein have been discovered, slowing the release of the files that supposed to be made public by last Friday.\"The US Attorney for the Southern District of New York and the FBI have informed the Department of Justice that they have uncovered over a million more documents potentially related to the Jeffrey Epstein case,\" the DOJ said in a post on X.\"We have lawyers working around the clock to review and make the legally required redactions to protect victims, and we will release the documents as soon as possible. Due to the mass volume of material, this process may take a few more weeks,\" the post continued.The Christmas Eve announcement drew pushback from lawmakers who had already been critical of the DOJ's handling of the Epstein files.Rep. Robert Garcia, the top Democrat on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, which is conducting its own investigation into Epstein, in a statement accused the White House of engaging \"in a cover-up protecting Epstein's co-conspirators and the powerful men who abused women and girls.\"\"It's outrageous that the DOJ has illegally withheld over 1 million documents from the public,\" said Garcia, who also called on Attorney General Pam Bondi to testify before Congress.The announcement came the same day a bipartisan group of Senators called for an audit of the DOJ's handling of the Epstein files.In a letter to DOJ Acting Inspector General Don Berthiaume, a group of 12 senators said the DOJ had violated a law -- dubbed the Epstein Files Transparency Act -- that passed Congress and was signed by President Donald Trump in November. The law mandated a full release of the Epstein files with minimal redactions by Dec. 19.The lawmakers -- led by Sens. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, and Jeff Merkley, D-Ore. -- said the DOJ has withheld files, released documents already publicly available and redacted certain releases to the extent that \"there are serious questions as to whether the Department is properly applying the limited exceptions for redaction that are permitted under the Act.\"Read more CNBC politics coverageEuropean Union approves over $105 billion toward Ukraine aid package for next two yearsBrown and MIT prof shooter suspect Neves Valente is found dead, authorities saysTrump Media to merge with fusion company TAE Technologies, DJT stock soarsTrump announces 'warrior dividend' of $1,776 to U.S. soldiers in prime-time speechEpstein accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell petitions to vacate sex crime convictionCongressional stock trading ban bill to get a vote in new year: House RepublicansFBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino is stepping down in JanuaryObamacare subsidies extension to get vote after 4 Republicans buck leadershipFCC chief Carr tells Senate that his agency is 'not formally ... independent'Trump vowed to block tankers carrying Venezuela's oil — nearly a dozen at sea nowKennedy Center to be renamed 'Trump-Kennedy Center,' White House saysTrump vowed to block tankers carrying Venezuela's oil — nearly a dozen at sea nowHouse passes bill to ease permits for building out AI infrastructureTrump sues BBC for $10 billion, claims defamation from Panorama documentaryPentagon takes big stake in new Korea Zinc refinery in Tenn., gets 10% of companyNew Trump tariffs collection hits $200 billion, Customs saysFormer Instacart employee says she was fired over her Democratic congressional campaignUkraine peace talks progressing, Russia open to EU membership, U.S. officials sayNew York AG sues UPS for allegedly shorting Christmas season workers' wagesTrump admin to hire 1,000 specialists for 'Tech Force'Trump doubles down on Rob Reiner criticism after killing; director's son in custodyTSA is giving airline passenger data to ICE for deportation push: NYTTrump's AI order may be 'illegal,' Democrats and consumer advocacy groups claimTrump sued by preservation group seeking to halt White House ballroom projectTrump says 'no big deal' after new Epstein photos showing him releasedPutin can fund war for years, ex-official says as Trump's resolve is testedIndiana redistricting bill that Trump demanded defeated in state SenateHouse passes INVEST Act to ease investment standards, boost capital in marketsDOJ fails again to indict New York AG James, a Trump target: ReportsTrump 'sells out' U.S. national security with Nvidia chip sales to China: WarrenTrump pushes for top prosecutor nominee Halligan after Comey, James cases tossedTrump willing to seize more oil tankers off Venezuela coast: White HouseSeized tanker will go to U.S. port, Trump admin intends 'to seize the oil'GOP lawmakers seek Trump aid for agricultural equipment after tariff pressureTrump says Fed could have 'at least doubled' latest interest rate cut'Spoof' ship: Seized oil tanker hid location, visited Iran and VenezuelaTrump admin touts pulling 9,500 truckers off road for failing English testsSwiss government says new 15% U.S. tariff ceiling retroactive to mid-NovemberHomeland Security Dept. buying Boeing 737s for ICE deportationsTrump officials move to end student loan payment pause for millions of borrowersJudge unseals Ghislaine Maxwell grand jury materials, citing Epstein files actUkraine at 'critical moment' in war as European allies ramp up pressure on RussiaDemocrats establish AI working group as industry bolsters DC presenceEx-Trump lawyer Habba resigns as NJ U.S. attorney after disqualification\"Given the Administration's historic hostility to releasing the files, politicization of the Epstein case more broadly, and failure to comply with the Epstein Files Transparency Act, a neutral assessment of its compliance with the statutory disclosure requirements is essential,\" the group wrote.Inspectors general are independent watchdogs that conduct audits and investigations of federal agencies. The DOJ inspector general is \"ideally placed\" to conduct an audit because he has full access to the files, the lawmakers wrote.At the beginning of his second term, Trump fired more than a dozen inspectors general across the federal government but spared longtime DOJ watchdog Michael Horowitz, who had been in the role since 2012. Horowitz left the post in June to take on the same role at the Federal Reserve.Trump tapped Berthiaume to become the DOJ's internal watchdog in October.The DOJ has released two major batches of Epstein files since Dec. 19, but the slow trickle of documents has angered lawmakers on both sides of the aisle. In a letter to Congress on Friday, Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche told lawmakers the DOJ would release the files on a \"rolling basis\" through the end of the year, defying the law's requirement. Now it appears the release will continue into the new year.\"A Christmas Eve news dump of 'a million more files' only proves what we already know: Trump is engaged in a massive coverup. The question Americans deserve answered is simple: WHAT are they hiding—and WHY?\" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said in a post to X on Wednesday.Schumer vowed earlier this week to force the Senate to vote on suing the DOJ for the full release of files. And Reps. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., and Ro Khanna, D-Calif., have threatened to hold Bondi and Blanche in inherent contempt.\"The survivors deserve justice. The DOJ release does not comply with the Epstein Files Transparency Act and does not provide what the survivors are guaranteed under the new law,\" Massie said in a post to X on Monday.Trump, a former friend of Epstein's, was largely absent from the DOJ's initial release of documents last Friday. The latest batch of files, released Tuesday, include many references to Trump, including an email that suggests Trump traveled often on Epstein's private plane in the 1990s.Trump has denied any wrongdoing associated with the disgraced New York financier. On Tuesday, the DOJ said in a post on X that \"some of these documents contain untrue and sensationalist claims made against President Trump that were submitted to the FBI right before the 2020 election.\"During his 2024 presidential campaign, Trump suggested he was open to declassifying some Epstein files, but has fought for much of this year to keep them under wraps. He has referred to the uproar over the Epstein files as a \"hoax\" and pressured some House Republican to drop their support for the legislation that would eventually compel their release. As the Epstein Files Transparency Act seemed poised to advance out of Congress, Trump belatedly gave his blessing to the effort. \"Full transparency—as called for bravely and repeatedly by survivors—is essential in identifying members of our society who enabled and participated in Epstein's crimes. Survivors deserve full disclosure,\" the lawmakers wrote. Murkowski was the lone Republican to sign the letter, though the Epstein Files Transparency Act passed both chambers with broad bipartisan support.",

    "body": "Jonathan Ross, chief executive officer of Groq Inc., during the GenAI Summit in San Francisco, California, US, on Thursday, May 30, 2024. David Paul | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesNvidia has agreed to buy assets from Groq, a designer of high-performance artificial intelligence accelerator chips, for $20 billion in cash, according to Alex Davis, CEO of Disruptive, which led the startup's latest financing round in September. Davis, whose firm has invested more than half a billion dollars in Groq since the company was founded in 2016, said the deal came together quickly. Groq raised $750 million at a valuation of about $6.9 billion three months ago. Investors in the round included Blackrock and Neuberger Berman, as well as Samsung, Cisco, Altimeter and 1789 Capital, where Donald Trump Jr. is a partner. Groq said in a blog post Wednesday that it's \"entered into a non-exclusive licensing agreement with Nvidia for Groq's inference technology,\" without disclosing a price. With the deal, Groq founder and CEO Jonathan Ross along with Sunny Madra, the company's president, and other senior leaders \"will join Nvidia to help advance and scale the licensed technology,\" the post said. Groq added that it will continue as an \"independent company,\" led by finance chief Simon Edwards as CEO. Colette Kress, Nvidia's CFO, declined comment on the transaction. Davis told CNBC that Nvidia is getting all of Groq's assets, though its nascent Groq cloud business is not part of the transaction. Groq said, \"GroqCloud will continue to operate without interruption.\"The deal represents by far Nvidia's largest purchase ever. The chipmaker's biggest acquisition to date came in 2019, when it bought Israeli chip designer Mellanox for close to $7 billion. At the end of October, Nvidia had $60.6 billion in cash and short-term investments, up from $13.3 billion in early 2023. In an email to employees that was obtained by CNBC, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said the agreement will expand Nvidia's capabilities.\"We plan to integrate Groq's low-latency processors into the NVIDIA AI factory architecture, extending the platform to serve an even broader range of AI inference and real-time workloads,\" Huang wrote. Huang added that, \"While we are adding talented employees to our ranks and licensing Groq's IP, we are not acquiring Groq as a company.\"Nvidia orchestrated a similar but smaller deal in September, when it shelled out more than $900 million to hire Enfabrica CEO Rochan Sankar and other employees at the AI hardware startup, and to license the company's technology, CNBC reported at the time. Other tech giants, including Meta, Google and Microsoft, have spent heavily over the last couple years to hire top AI talent through various types of licensing deals. watch nowNvidia has ramped up its investments in chip startups and the broader ecosystem as its cash pile has mounted. The company has backed AI and energy infrastructure company Crusoe, artificial intelligence model developer Cohere, and boosted its investment in CoreWeave as the AI-centric cloud provider was getting ready to go public this year.In September, Nvidia said it intended to invest up to $100 billion in OpenAI, with the startup committed to deploying at least 10 gigawatts of Nvidia products. The companies have yet to announce a formal deal. That same month, Nvidia said it would invest $5 billion in Intel as part of a partnership.Groq has been targeting revenue of $500 million this year amid booming demand for AI accelerator chips used in speeding up the process for large language models to complete inference-related tasks. The company was not pursuing a sale when it was approached by Nvidia, Davis said.Groq was founded in 2016 by a group of former engineers, including Ross. He was one of the creators of Google's tensor processing unit, or TPU, the search giant's custom chip that's being used by some companies as an alternative to Nvidia's graphics processing units. In its initial filing with the SEC, announcing a $10.3 million fundraising in late 2016, Groq listed as principals Ross and Douglas Wightman, an entrepreneur and former engineer at the Google X \"moonshot factory.\" Wightman left Groq in 2019, according to his LinkedIn profile. Groq isn't the only chip startup that's gained traction during the AI boom.AI chipmaker Cerebras Systems had planned to go public this year but withdrew its IPO filing in October  after announcing that it raised more than $1 billion in a fundraising round.In a filing with the SEC, Cerebras said it does not intend to conduct a proposed offering \"at this time,\" but didn't provide a reason. A spokesperson told CNBC at the time that the company still hopes to go public as soon as possible.Cerebras filed for an initial public offering in late 2024, as it was ramping up to take on Nvidia in an effort to create processors for running generative AI models. — CNBC's Jordan Novet contributed to this report.

    "body": "U.S. President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy shake hands during a press conference after their lunch meeting at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort, in Palm Beach, Florida, on Dec. 28, 2025.Jonathan Ernst | ReutersPresident Donald Trump on Sunday said that talks to end the Russia-Ukraine war had progressed after his meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Florida, though Trump acknowledged that thorny issues over territory remain.\"I do think we're getting a lot closer, maybe very close,\" Trump told reporters after emerging from the talks.In his remarks, Zelenskyy called the peace talks a \"really great discussion\" in which U.S.-Ukraine security guarantees were \"100% agreed\" upon, though Trump gave a slightly lower estimate when asked about that part of the proposal.\"We agree that security guarantees is a key milestone in achieving lasting peace,\" Zelenskyy said.Further, the Ukrainian president said that Trump will host meetings next month with Ukrainian and European leaders to continue developing the peace plan.When asked by a reporter what issues remain unresolved, Trump said it was about \"the land.\"\"Some of that land has been taken,\" Trump said. \"Some of that land is maybe up for grabs, but it may be taken over the next period of a number of months, and you are better off making a deal now.\"Earlier Sunday in a Truth Social post, Trump said he had a \"good and very productive telephone call\" with Putin ahead of the Zelenskyy talks. Trump told reporters on Sunday that he planned on calling Putin again after the conclusion of the meeting.The high-stakes conversations at Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort come at a key moment in efforts to end nearly four years of war initiated when Russia invaded Ukraine in early 2022.Zelenskyy, who arrived in Florida early Sunday, has said the two leaders plan to talk about economic and security agreements and the \"territorial issues\" that remain major sticking points between Russia and Ukraine.While Zelenskyy told reporters this week that a 20-point peace proposal is roughly 90% ready, it's unclear if the outcome of the peace talks would be acceptable to Putin. Chief obstacles to an agreement with Russia include the Donbas areas most highly coveted by Putin, U.S. security guarantees for Ukraine, and the status of Europe's largest nuclear plant.Moscow has reportedly made advances on the battlefield in recent months, claiming control over more regions of eastern Ukraine, and their officials have repeatedly insisted that Ukraine give up all of the Donbas, even parts that are still under Kyiv's control.On Saturday, Russia hit Ukraine's capital and other parts of the country with hundreds of missiles and drones, knocking out power and heat in parts of the capital, according to Reuters. Zelenskyy called it Russia's response to the U.S.-brokered peace efforts.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy reacts as U.S. President Donald Trump, with Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner, U.S. Special Envoy Steve Witkoff and White House Chief of Staff Susan Wiles, speaks during a meeting with a Ukrainian delegation led by Zelenskiy, at Trump's Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Florida, on Dec. 28, 2025.Jonathan Ernst | ReutersThe peace proposal includes calls for a Ukrainian vote on ceding disputed territory to Russia, as well as a demilitarized \"free economic zone\" in Donetsk, the capital and largest city in part of the larger Donbas region. Zelenskyy on Sunday pointed to the attacks on his country's energy infrastructure amid the peace efforts and indicated that part of his motivation was to maintain pressure on Russia, including sanctions and defense technology for Ukraine.\"These are some of the most active diplomatic days of the year right now, and a lot can be decided before the New Year,\" Zelenskyy said on social media platform X. \"We are doing everything toward this, but whether decisions will be made depends on our partners — those who help Ukraine, and those who put pressure on Russia so that Russians feel the consequences of their own aggression.\"Earlier Sunday, a Kremlin official said that the U.S. and Russian leaders were aligned in opposing a temporary ceasefire amid talks and hinted that Ukraine needed to make a \"bold decision\" regarding the Donbas region for the war to end. \"The main thing is that the presidents of Russia and the United States hold similar views that the option of a temporary ceasefire proposed by the Ukrainians and the Europeans under the pretext of preparing for a referendum or under other pretexts only leads to a prolongation of the conflict,\" Yuri Ushakov, a Kremlin foreign policy aide, told Reuters.In his Truth Social post, Trump said his meeting with Zelenskyy would be held in the main dining room at his Mar-a-Lago resort, with media present.In February, a meeting between Trump and Zelenskyy over possible mineral deals between the countries devolved into a public spectacle, with Trump and Vice President JD Vance accusing Zelenskyy of being \"disrespectful\" to the U.S. president.

    "body": "As a relationship counselor with over 10 years of experience, I've learned that even the strongest couples face conflict. What sets emotionally intelligent couples apart is their ability to stay connected, even when disagreements arise.I'm often more concerned about couples who never fight, because avoiding conflict entirely can hide unresolved hurts. After all, the closer you are, the more likely ruptures are to happen, and how you handle them matters.Here are three things emotionally intelligent couples do differently when they are in conflict.1. They don't assume the worst about their partner's intentWe've all been there. One sharp comment can seem like an attack on your character. For example, you forget to text back and it is interpreted as not caring. A request for space could be misconstrued as abandonment.Research shows that when couples are distressed, they're more likely to interpret a partner's behavior in ways that make it feel intentional, fixed, and personal (\"you did this because you're that kind of person\"). Psychologists call this \"negative attribution bias.\"Before conflicts devolve into defensiveness and character attacks, I give my clients a simple exercise.Write down what you want to say. For example, \"Why do you shut down every time I bring something up?\" Then cross out every sentence that diagnoses your partner's motives (\"you don't care,\" \"you're trying to…,\" \"you always…\").Next, try a reframe. Write down the observable behavior, its impact on you, and one clear, workable request: \"When you go silent in moments like this, I start filling in the gaps on my own. I tell myself you don't care or that I've done something wrong, and I feel alone pretty quickly. What would really help is just hearing where you are, even if you don't know what else to say yet.\"This is a great way to protect your relationship while still naming the problem and offering something constructive.2. They take responsibility for their emotions and plan how to regulate them togetherEmotionally intelligent couples don't expect their partner to fix their feelings, but they also don't shut each other out. A partner's presence can help them stay regulated and connected, even in anger or frustration.Pausing during conflict is one of the hardest skills. It's hardest when you're triggered and least able to access your tools. I often encourage couples to plan ahead with a \"clean pause\" script, like: \"I need 20 minutes so I don't say something I'll regret. I'll come back.\" Follow-through matters as much as the pause. Couples can also use co-regulation — small ways to calm together: \"Can we sit next to each other while we talk?\" or, \"Can I get a hug first, then we keep going?\"These strategies help partners stay connected while still taking responsibility for their own emotions.3. They stay curious, even during major conflicts When people feel threatened, the brain loves shortcuts. Emotionally intelligent couples slow this process down and become, in effect, investigators of each other's inner worlds.Curiosity has been associated with greater closeness and intimacy in conversations, especially during moments of disagreement.Part of why curiosity disappears whether it's one, 10, or 20 years in is because we start living off our assumptions. We tell ourselves we already know what our partner meant, what they felt, and why they did it because the person across from you is so familiar.The problem is that once you think you already know the story, you stop learning about your partner's actual experience. Conflict then becomes two competing narratives instead of a shared inquiry into what's really happening, even when you disagree.Instead of assuming the worst, the most emotionally intelligent couples will ask questions like:\"Can you help me understand what was happening for you?\"\"What did you hear me say?\"\"What part of this feels hardest?\"\"What's been on your mind lately that I haven't asked about?\"\"What's something you want more of right now?\"The strongest, most emotionally intelligent couples genuinely see who their partner is becoming, not who they want them to be or who they once were.

    "body": "Traveling is no longer just about the destination – or even the journey. It's about the experience you walk away with.Since the end of Covid, experience‑led travel has continued to evolve, shifting away from checking off landmarks and more towards meaningful trips that help travelers connect with the people and places they visit.CNBC analyzed 25 year-end travel reports and identified the five biggest trends that are set to shape the year ahead. 1. The anti-touristTo better experience local culture, avoid contributing to overtourism, and potentially save a few dollars, travelers are increasingly avoiding peak seasons and heavily visited destinations.Forty-five percent of advisors from travel agency Virtuoso say their clients are adjusting plans due to climate change. Of those advisors, 76% report increased interest in shoulder-season or off-peak travel, while 75% say clients prefer destinations with moderate weather, according to the company's 2026 \"Luxe Report\". The report, published in October, also showed the top ways travelers seek to travel sustainably, easing the pressure on local communities and preserving authentic experiences. That shift is fueling the rise of so‑called \"secondary cities,\" which sit outside major tourist hubs and offer more immersive experiences. Online travel platform Agoda found that accommodation searches in Asia's secondary destinations are growing 15% faster than in traditional tourism hubs.Its 2026 Travel Outlook Report also showed that governments are catching on. For example, Indonesia rolled out its \"Tourism 5.0\" strategy, which aims to develop five \"super priority\" secondary destinations designed to shift tourism beyond Bali. Japan, too, is leaning into regional campaigns to steer visitors away from Tokyo and other major city centers.2. 'Decision detox' holidaysTraditionally, all-inclusive travel was about efficiency, with travelers planning their itineraries to maximize their holiday time. But today, travelers are mentally exhausted before going on a trip, and increasingly outsourcing planning to agencies or even hotels that offer all-inclusive packages, the latest Lemongrass Marketing travel report shows. Essentially, \"travelers want someone they trust to make good choices for them, so they can properly switch off,\" said Tara Schwenk, senior director of digital strategy at Lemongrass Marketing, in an email response to CNBC's queries.\"As cognitive overload becomes a defining feature of modern life, decision-light travel is no longer a niche wellness add-on, it's becoming a core expectation, particularly among time-poor, high-stress travellers,\" Schwenk added.The trend has reshaped high-end trips, replacing endless options with curated choices, luxury travel company HunterMoss said. That allows ultra-luxury travelers \"to be free from thinking about additional costs or logistics planning during their trip,\" said Julie Hunter, director and chief operating officer of HunterMoss. 3. Wellness moves beyond spasAnother trend that's expanding is wellness travel, which has evolved from spa packages to science-backed longevity programs and mental health-focused trips.Offerings include Ayurvedic programs in India, yoga-and-surf escapes in Costa Rica and silent retreats in Canada. Many travelers view wellness travel as long-term health investments, according to the Virtuoso report. The appeal of these trips transcends class boundaries, from budget nature trips to a \"healthy wealthy\" trend. It is also popular with solo travelers and couples, as well as older and younger travelers, the report added.Two-thirds of U.S. travelers under the age of 35 say they prefer active trips that involve hiking, rafting, and cycling, and over 50% believe in maintaining a wellness routine while traveling, according to a separate report by tour operator Contiki.4. Nostalgic travel Younger travelers are seeking vacations that take them down memory lane. Nearly 8 in 10 Americans under the age of 35 say they either have or want to recreate a childhood trip, according to Contiki's report. At the same time, new retirees — a group which is starting to include the oldest members of Gen X — are embracing their newfound freedom through \"golden gap year\" trips, according to consultancy firm The Future Laboratory.With no bosses to report to and no kids in tow, they are taking extended trips, both overland and via cruise ship, that are more adventurous than retiree trips of the past, their \"Future Forecast 2026\" report said. The report added that nearly 25% of retirees have traveled for a year, or would consider doing so, citing research from the UK retirement village operator Inspired Villages. 5. AI in hotel serviceWhile more travelers are turning to artificial intelligence to book trips, hotels are also using it to better understand their guests. Next year is expected to mark a significant turn in hotels moving from reacting to guests' requests to predicting their wants – using predictive intelligence to personalize stays before guests arrive, according to Oracle Hospitality's report. Some hotels already allow guests to personalize every detail of their room, such as adding a reformer Pilates machine and blackout blinds, or choosing a room closest to the breakfast buffet, according to a separate report by travel technology company Amadeus.\"As AI accelerates, personalization will no longer be a nice-to-have but the default operating system of choice,\" the Amadeus report added.",

    "body": "watch nowRecently appointed NASA Administrator Jared Isaacman on Friday told CNBC that the U.S. will return to the moon within President Donald Trump's second term. Isaacman, a close ally of SpaceX CEO Elon Musk, told CNBC's \"Closing Bell Overtime\" that Trump's recommitment to exploring the moon is key to unlocking the \"orbital economy.\"\"We want to have that opportunity to explore and realize the scientific, economic and national security potential on the moon,\" he said. Isaacman's comments on Friday were some of his first public remarks since being confirmed to his position by the Senate last week, after a long saga throughout 2025. Trump initially nominated Isaacman for the NASA head role in December 2024, but the president abruptly pulled his pick in May due to Isaacman's \"prior associations.\" Although Trump did not specify what those were, some have suggested that it was related to Isaacman's close ties with Musk, with whom Trump had a heated feud over the summer.In November, Trump renominated Isaacman, who was an entrepreneur and became a civilian astronaut after commanding an orbital mission aboard SpaceX's Crew Dragon spacecraft in 2021.Lunar opportunities include establishing space data centers and infrastructure, as well as potentially mining Helium-3, a rare gas embedded in the moon's surface that could become a major fuel for fusion power, Isaacman said. He added that after building a \"moon base,\" NASA will look into making investments in nuclear power and space nuclear propulsion to further exploration.NASA is currently working with various contractors including SpaceX, Jeff Bezo's Blue Origin and Boeing, to participate in its Artemis campaign, a moon exploration program that also aims to prepare for Mars missions.The campaign was propelled after Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill Act allocated $9.9 billion to NASA earlier this year.The Artemis II mission, NASA's first test flight with crew aboard the Space Launch System rocket and the Orion spacecraft, is expected to take off in the near future, Isaacman said.The expedition will be followed up with the Artemis III mission, which SpaceX is contracted to build the lunar landing system for.SpaceX and Blue Origin are refining heavy lift launch vehicles with on-orbit cryogenic propeller transfer to become more readily reusable, he added.\"That's what's going to enable us to be able to go to and from the moon affordably, with great frequency, and set up for missions to Mars and beyond,\" Isaacman said.",

    "body": "The growing wealth and enhanced spending power of the over-50s is poised to accelerate a range of investment opportunities across multiple sectors in the U.K., according to investors.Market pros say this age group — dubbed the \"Grey Pound\" or \"Silver Spenders\" — is gaining greater control over its assets. With greater wealth and more discretionary income, a larger chunk of this demographic is increasingly seen as the new \"idle rich.\"Dan Coatsworth, head of markets at AJ Bell, said that the over-50s were an increasingly influential demographic within the consumer space.\"Those still working might be well advanced in their career, paid off their mortgage, and have lots of disposable cash. They might have worked hard for decades and feel like they deserve to splash the cash,\" Coatsworth told CNBC.\"Those in retirement might be in the generation that received generous defined benefit pension schemes and collect a tidy sum to fund an extravagant lifestyle,\" he added.Coatsworth said the group wants to protect as much of their wealth as they can from taxation, which means seeking advice on tax, investments, and general financial planning.Compounding assetsAlyx Wood, co-founder and chief investment officer at Kernow Asset Management, said there was a clear subset of winners and losers within this cohort.Day-to-day life for \"a lot of\" them is still \"quite tough and normal,\" but there are others who are \"just absolutely nailing it in terms of compounding their assets,\" he said.This latter wealthier segment is developing an appetite for luxury goods \"that they've never had before,\" as well as for \"higher-end\" wealth management and insurance services.These customers are increasingly seeking out \"content, story, getting involved, a purpose\" that extends beyond traditional passive returns, Wood added.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconHiscox.He highlighted names like insurance group Hiscox and privately-owned wealth managers Evelyn Partners as potential winners as older consumers turn to certain premium wealth management and insurance products.\"The banks are trying to buy back into the wealth management industry,\" said Wood, pointing to the reported interest in Evelyn Partners from NatWest Group and Barclays as private equity owners Permira and Warburg Pincus seek to exit. \"I expect you'll see a few of those.\"Wood, a contrarian stock picker whose hedge fund specializes in U.K. equities, last month outlined a major position on Saga plc at the annual Sohn London investment conference, which he said was also partly a wager on the strength of the \"Silver Pound.\"He said people living their \"Saga years,\" a reference to the travel and insurance brand that focuses on the over-50s, will account for about 60% of all U.K. consumer spending by 2030.Saga — which makes up about 10% of Kernow's portfolio — is a \"materially undervalued\" business, whose share price could surge over 400% in the next few years, Wood added.'The list goes on'Wood said that Pets At Home, the London-listed specialist retailer of pet food, toys, and accessories, was another name facing near-term pressures that could ultimately emerge as a beneficiary of the trend, as older consumers buy more for their pets and spend less on their children.\"Experiences and material goods will rank highly on their list of places to spend money – such as holidays, nice meals, fancy cars, home renovations, beauty products, wellness,\" Coatsworth said of the cohort. \"The list goes on.\"Stock Chart IconStock chart iconPets At Home.Coatsworth also said that the healthcare sector was a likely winner, as an ageing population will mean rising demand for medicine and treatment.\"Private care homes, retirement villages and property investors with medical providers as tenants are among the winners from this trend,\" Coatsworth told CNBC via email.",

Davis' firm, Disruptive, has invested more than half a billion dollars in Groq and led the startup's latest financing round in September at a $6.9 billion valuation.Groq founder and CEO Jonathan Ross along with Sunny Madra, the company's president, and other senior leaders \"will join Nvidia to help advance and scale the licensed technology,\" the startup said in the post, adding that it will continue as an \"independent company,\" led by finance chief Simon Edwards.watch nowAs an acquisition, Groq would mark by far Nvidia's largest in its 32-year history. Its biggest prior purchase happened in 2019, when Nvidia bought Israeli chip designer Mellanox for close to $7 billion.But Nvidia is instead following a playbook used by other tech giants over the last couple years, spending billions of dollars to hire top talent in AI and to get access to key technology through licensing agreements. It's a strategy that's been employed by Meta, Google, Microsoft and Amazon. Nvidia itself previously used the tactic, shelling out more than $900 million in September to hire Enfabrica CEO Rochan Sankar and other employees at the AI hardware startup, and to license the company's technology, CNBC reported at the time.By avoiding traditional acquisitions, tech companies have been able to skirt some level of antitrust scrutiny and quickly close deals to bring in the people they most covet. \"Antitrust would seem to be the primary risk here, though structuring the deal as a non-exclusive license may keep the fiction of competition alive,\" Rasgon wrote in a note to clients on Thursday. His firm recommends buying Nvidia shares and has a $275 price target on the stock.Shares of Nvidia rose about 1% on Friday to $190.53. The stock has gained 42% this year and is up thirteenfold since the end of 2022, when generative AI started taking off following the launch of OpenAI's ChatGPT.Nvidia has been using its expanding cash pile to spread capital across the AI ecosystem, including through recent investments in OpenAI and Intel. At the end of October, Nvidia had $60.6 billion in cash and short-term investments, up from $13.3 billion in early 2023.Widening the 'competitive moat'Groq was founded in 2016 by a group of former engineers, including Ross. He was one of the creators of Google's tensor processing units, or TPUs, the search giant's custom chips that are being used by some companies as an alternative to Nvidia's graphics processing units, or GPUs. Groq's specialty is on the inference side of the market, which refers to the the use of AI to make decisions based on new information. Nvidia dominates the training piece of the market, which involves teaching AI models to learn from patterns in large amounts of data. Analysts at Cantor said in a report Friday that Nvidia is \"playing both offense and defense\" by snapping up Groq's assets, keeping them from potentially landing in the hands of a competitor. \"We think this acquisition only enhances Nvidia's full system stack and overall leadership in the AI market (and only widens its competitive moat),\" wrote the analysts, who kept their buy rating and $300 price target. BofA Securities analysts also maintained their buy recommendation and $275 target following the announcement. In a note Friday, they characterized the deal as \"surprising, expensive but strategic,\" and said it shows Nvidia recognizes that \"while GPU dominated AI training, the rapid shift towards inference could require more specialized chips.\"The analysts said that key questions remain, such as who will own Groq's language processing unit intellectual property, whether it can be licensed to Nvidia competitors and whether what's left of Groq — its nascent cloud business — could possibly \"undercut NVDA's LPU-based service with lower pricing.\"Nvidia isn't commenting on any of those details for now. The first opportunity analysts and investors will likely get to hear from the company will be Jan. 5, when CEO Jensen Huang is scheduled to speak at CES in Las Vegas. — CNBCs David Faber contributed to this reportWATCH: Nvidia GPUs to Google TPUs — Breaking down all the AI chipswatch now",

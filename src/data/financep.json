    "body": "An Exxon Mobil gas station in Daly City, California, US, on Thursday, Jan. 29, 2026. Benjamin Fanjoy | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesExxonMobil on Friday posted fourth-quarter earnings that beat Wall Street estimates, despite oil prices  booking the biggest annual loss in years due to oversupply. Exxon shares fell about 2% in premarket trading. Here is what the oil company reported for the fourth quarter compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:Earnings per share: $1.71 adjusted  vs. $1.68 expectedRevenue: $82.31 billion vs. $81.43 billionIn the fourth quarter, Exxon reported net income of $6.5 billion, or $1.53 per share, a decline of 14.6% from $7.61 billion, or $1.72 per share, in the year-ago period. Revenue came in at $82.31 billion in the quarter, down 1.3% from $83.43 billion in the same quarter last year. After adjustments, Exxon earned $1.71 per share, excluding items, outpacing the Street's estimate of $1.68 per share. It exceeded expectations even as crude logged the biggest annual price decline since 2020. Exxon's production business booked a profit of $3.52 billion, down from $5.7 billion the third quarter.  Its refining business posted earnings of $3.39 billion, up from $1.84 billion in the previous quarter. The oil major achieved its highest full-year net production in more than 40 years at 4.7 million barrels per day. It pumped 4.98 million bpd in the quarter with its assets in the Permian Basin and Guyana setting output records for the period. Exxon's capital expenditures totaled $29 billion in 2025. It expects to spend $27 billion to $29 billion in 2026.The oil major's results come as President Donald Trump is pressuring the industry to return to Venezuela after the U.S. captured Nicolas Maduro, the South American country's leader. CEO Darren Woods told Trump that Venezuela is \"uninvestable\" during a White House meeting on Jan. 9. He said Venezuela will need major changes for Exxon to return. Caracas has seized Exxon's assets twice.Woods said Exxon is ready to send a technical team to Venezuela to evaluate the state of the oil industry in the country. ",

    "body": "President Donald Trump on Friday named Kevin Warsh to succeed Jerome Powell as Federal Reserve chair, ending a five-month odyssey that has seen unprecedented turmoil around the central bank.The decision culminates a process that officially began last summer but started much earlier than that, with Trump launching a fusillade of criticism against the Powell-led Fed almost since Powell took the job in 2018. \"I have known Kevin for a long period of time, and have no doubt that he will go down as one of the GREAT Fed Chairmen, maybe the best,\" said Trump in a Truth Social post announcing the selection.The pick of Warsh, 55, likely wouldn't ripple markets because of his past Fed experience and Wall Street's view that he wouldn't always do Trump's bidding.\"He has the respect and credibility of the financial markets,\" said David Bahnsen, chief investment officer of The Bahnsen Group, on CNBC's \"Squawk Box.\"\"There was no person who was going to get this job who wasn't going to be cutting rates in the short term. However, I believe longer term he will be a credible candidate,\" added Bahnsen.Since Powell's confirmation in 2018, during Trump's first term, he has persistently hectored policymakers to lower interest rates aggressively. Even with three successive reductions in the latter part of 2025, the president kept up the attack, pressing for lower rates and criticizing Powell for cost overruns at the Fed's massive renovation of its Washington, D.C. headquarters.For his part, Warsh in a CNBC interview last summer called for \"regime change\" at the Fed.\"The credibility deficit lies with the incumbents that are at the Fed, in my view,\" he said during the July interview. It's a position that could put him in an adversarial role at an institution where consensus building is key to policy implementation.Trump's decision to nominate Warsh comes at one of the most precarious moments for the U.S. central bank in decades — with inflation not fully defeated, government borrowing escalating and the Fed itself facing unusually direct political pressure over how it conducts monetary policy.Most recently, the Justice Department subpoenaed Powell regarding the construction project. In an uncharacteristically blunt response, Powell charged the move was a \"pretext\" to push the Fed into following Trump's orders and ease policy further.To that end, the nomination comes as questions about Fed independence, a bedrock of central bank credibility, have moved from academic debate into concern. Trump and other administration officials have  floated ideas ranging from tighter White House oversight to changes in how the central bank sets rates, including forcing the chair to consult with the president on rate decisions.The nomination ends a competitive derby that at one point included 11 candidates. They spanned from former and current Fed officials to prominent economists and Wall Street pros in an interview process led by Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. Ultimately, the field was winnowed to five then four, with Trump last week hinting to CNBC that he had arrived at his choice.From here, the nominee faces a tough road.Republican Sen. Thom Tillis has indicated he will block any Fed nominees until the Justice Department probe is finished. The issues, though, are more than political.Though Trump has insisted that inflation has been vanquished, it remains a good deal from the Fed's 2% target. At the same time, the labor market has slowed, with the economy current in a no-fire no-hire climate that poses another challenge to Fed policy.In any event, markets don't expect much action from the new chair: Traders are pricing in at most two more cuts this year before the benchmark fed funds rate lands around 3%, which policymakers have indicates is the long-run \"neutral\" rate that neither boosts nor hinders economic growth.Then there's the issue of what happens with Powell.Though chairs historically have resigned their Fed positions after being removed as chair, that may not be the case this time around. Powell has two years remaining in his governor term, and he could choose to serve it as a bulwark against Trump's efforts to compromise Fed independence. The Supreme Court already is weighing Trump's move to unseat Governor Lisa Cook, a case that ultimately could decide what powers a president has over Fed board members.",

    "body": "Signage at a Chevron gas station in San Mateo, California, US, on Thursday, Jan. 29, 2026. Benjamin Fanjoy | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesChevron on Friday reported fourth-quarter earnings that beat Wall Street estimates as record oil production offset the pinch of lower crude prices. Last year, oil logged its biggest annual price decline since 2020. Chevron could be poised to grow its production even further this year in the wake of a U.S. military intervention in Venezuela that removed President Nicolas Maduro and effectively seized control of the South American nation's oil industry. Chevron is the only U.S. oil major operating in Venezuela under a special license issued by the U.S. Treasury Department. It said Friday it can ramp up production in Venezuela by 50% over the next 18 to 24 months. \"We have been a part of Venezuela's past for more than a century. We remain committed to its present. And we stand ready to help it build a ⁠better future while strengthening U.S. energy and regional security,\" CEO Mike Wirth said in a news release.Chevron shares slipped less than 1% in premarket trading. Here is what Chevron reported for the fourth quarter compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:Earnings per share: $1.52 adjusted vs. $1.45 expectedRevenue: $46.87 billion vs. $47.1 billionChevron reported net income of $2.77 billion for the quarter, or $1.39 per share, about a 14% decline compared with earnings of $3.24 billion, or $1.84 per share, in the same period a year ago. After adjustments, Chevron earned $1.52 per share, outpacing the Street's consensus estimate of $1.45 per share. Revenue came in at $46.87 billion, a decline of 10% frome $52.23 billion in the same quarter last year. More barrels from Venezuela would add to Chevron's already strong output in the U.S. and around the world. It increased production in 2025 by 12% worldwide and 16% in the U.S. to record levels. For the quarter, Chevron pumped 4.05 million barrels per day, an increase of about 21% compared with 3.35 million bpd in the same period a year ago. Wall Street views Chevron as the U.S. oil company best positioned to benefit from the U.S. intervention in Venezuela. Competitors such as ExxonMobil are hesitant to return to Venezuela due to the country's history of seizing the assets of international oil majors. Chevron's U.S. production business booked profits of $1.26 billion, down about 11% compared with $1.42 billion in the year-ago period. International production posted a profit of $1.78 billion, down 38% from earnings of $2.88 billion in the year-ago period.The company said it would increase its quarterly dividend by 4% to $1.78 per share.

    "body": "A General Motors Co. Chevrolet Blazer electric vehicle at a dealership in Colma, California, Jan. 23, 2026.David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesDETROIT — American consumers are hitting a fork in the road when it comes to the U.S. automotive industry. Affluent buyers are purchasing new vehicles at increasingly higher prices, while lower-income ones are continuing to drive used models.This trend is a growing concern for auto executives and feeds into worries that U.S. consumers are facing a \"K-shaped\" economy, where the wealthy keep seeing gains while those who have lower incomes struggle.\"We have a different vehicle buyer today than we had just a few years ago,\" Cox Automotive senior economist Charlie Chesbrough said Thursday during an auto analyst event. \"The key takeaway here is that we're seeing the average buyer here is much more affluent.\"Cox reports that the share of new-car buyers with incomes of less than $100,000 has dropped from 50% in 2020 to 37% last year, representing millions of lost sales. On the other end of the spectrum, the share of buyers with incomes of more than $200,000 has grown from 18% to 29% during that timeframe.The shift has occurred as MSRP, or manufacturer's suggested retail price, hit an average of $51,000 in 2025, according to Cox, and as buyers are also dealing with higher insurance costs and inflation. Consumer sentiment, meanwhile, is at recessionary levels.New-car sales were at record levels of more than 17 million prior to 2020 but have experienced mixed results since, ending 2025 with 16.3 million sales. Brand-new vehicles have never been for the majority of U.S. consumers, but automakers have increasingly been pricing millions of Americans out, including by cutting entry-level vehicle lines such as small cars.\"We're now relying on the extremely wealthy to generate the sales,\" Mark Barrott, a partner at consulting firm Plante Moran, said during the Thursday event. \"That's a structural problem from an affordability perspective.\"Barrott said U.S. sales aren't hitting records but that they're still pretty good compared with historical levels. Automotive executives may begin taking more notice if the market conditions shrink due to buyers getting priced out, he added.\"It's not unrealistic to think that in the next two or three years we could get to that kind of level, and then this really starts to hurt the [automakers],\" he said.A modeling study by Plante Moran found a third of the U.S. population can't afford new vehicles, with very limited choices for those who may be on the fence. There are roughly 110 \"affordable\" models, in relative terms, for household incomes of $65,000 or less compared with more than 250 \"affordable\" models for those with incomes of up to $105,000, according to the study.The median household income in the U.S. was $83,730 in 2024, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. That has risen 24% since 2020, when it was $67,521.U.S. average transaction prices for new vehicles, meanwhile, were hovering around $50,000 toward the end of last year, up 30% from less than $38,747 to begin 2020, according to Cox Automotive.CarMax's Edmunds this month reported new-car buyers are increasingly spending more per month on the purchase of a new vehicle, with a record of 20% committing to average monthly payments of more than $1,000 during the fourth quarter of last year.Ford CEO Jim Farley earlier this month warned the U.S. automotive industry needs to be mindful of affordability concerns leading to consumer pullback. While producing larger, more expensive vehicles can be more profitable for automakers, it can shrink the market and lower sales. \"Anyone in the auto industry … we should all be very careful about consumer demand,\" Farley said Jan. 13 during an event for the Detroit Auto Show. \"That's really important.\"Read more CNBC auto newsAuto executives are hoping for the best and planning for the worst in 2026GM expects to top Ford in U.S. vehicle production as it faces up to $4 billion in tariff costsStellantis stock off 43% as Jeep maker turns five, executes turnaroundEV realism is here.

Martin Bernetti | Afp | Getty ImagesPanama's top court has ruled against Hong Kong-based CK Hutchison, saying a concession held by a subsidiary of the firm to operate ports at either end of the Panama Canal was unconstitutional.The outcome is widely seen as a victory for the Trump administration's security ambitions in the Western Hemisphere, with the U.S. seeking to counter China's strategic influence in the region.In a brief statement published late Thursday, the Supreme Court of Panama said the terms under which Panama Ports Company (PPC), a subsidiary of CK Hutchison, runs the port of Balboa on the Pacific Coast and Cristóbal on the Atlantic violated the country's constitution and were no longer valid.The court said it came to its decision after \"extensive deliberation\" but did not provide further details on the next steps.It also raises questions about the future ownership of some Panama Canal operations, including CK Hutchison's proposed $23 billion sale of 43 ports across the globe to a consortium led by BlackRock and Mediterranean Shipping Company (MSC). BlackRock declined to comment on the ruling. CK Hutchison and MSC did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Read moreThe decision comes roughly one year after U.S. President Donald Trump threatened to seize control of the Panama Canal, saying the critically important waterway was \"vital to our country\" and claiming, \"it's being operated by China.\" The Trump administration has made blocking China's influence over the Panama Canal one of its top priorities.\"The Monroe Doctrine is a big deal but we have superseded it by a lot, by a real lot. They now call it the Donroe Doctrine,\" Trump said earlier this month, shortly after U.S. troops conducted an operation to capture Venezuela's president Nicolás Maduro on Jan. 3.\"Under our new national security strategy, American dominance in the Western Hemisphere will never be questioned again,\" Trump said. China pledges to take necessary measuresPPC, which has held the contract to operate the ports of Balboa and Cristóbal since the 1990s, said on Friday that the decision was inconsistent with the relevant legal framework.\"The new ruling, based on available information, lacks legal basis and jeopardizes not only PPC and its contract, but also the well-being and stability of thousands of Panamanian families who depend directly and indirectly on port activity but also the rule of law and legal certainty in the country,\" PPC said in a statement. Shares of CK Hutchison closed 4.6% lower on Friday as Hong Kong's Hang Seng index slipped over 2% for the session.Aerial photograph of the Panama Canal at sunset, March 2025.

(Photo by Tomohiro Ohsumi/Getty Images)Tomohiro Ohsumi | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesAs Japan heads to the polls on Feb. 8, voters are weighing familiar concerns such as the cost of living, wages and the weak yen as they cast ballots in the Lower House election.Beyond the economy, however, the vote is also shaping up as a test of Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi herself, with analysts saying the fiercely conservative leader has effectively turned the election into a referendum on her leadership.\"She's trying to make it as a referendum on whether the people accept [her] as a prime minister or not,\" said Kazuto Suzuki, director at the Institute of Geoeconomics, a Tokyo-based think tank.Takaichi has made little effort to downplay the personal stakes. On Jan. 19, she said she was \"putting my future as prime minister on this election\" and asked voters to decide whether they could entrust the management of the country to her.If the LDP manages to gain a clear majority in this election, it will be entirely attributable to Takaichi's personal popularity — little else has changed since July when the LDP was drubbed at the polls.\"Kristi GovellaJapan Chair, Center for Strategic and International StudiesThe strategy reflects Takaichi's high approval ratings, which until recently had stood above 70%. The prime minister is seeking to translate that personal popularity into votes for the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, whose own approval remains far weaker.\"[Takaichi is] betting on her high levels of public approval and fragmentation among the opposition parties to carry the day,\" said Mireya Solís, director of the Center for Asia Policy Studies at the Brookings Institution.Takaichi currently leads an untested coalition of the LDP and the Japan Innovation Party, following the end of a 26-year partnership with Komeito in October.While her personal ratings remain strong, support for the LDP itself lags at just under 30%, underscoring the gap between leader and party.Jesper Koll, expert director at Tokyo-based financial services firm Monex Group, told CNBC in December that Takaichi was an \"inspiration\" to both older voters and, in particular, younger Japanese.Her personal appeal, rather than her economic policies, may prove decisive, Koll said, potentially driving a landslide victory.\"Takaichi is the living example of a self-made woman rising to the top against all the odds — self-made, a normal working-class family background, neither money nor Brahman, but hard work, dedication, passion, and willingness to do what is right.\"Jesper KollExpert Director, Monex Group\"Takaichi is the living example of a self-made woman rising to the top against all the odds — self-made, a normal working-class family background, neither money nor Brahman,\" Koll said. \"But hard work, dedication, passion, and willingness to do what is right.\"Others cautioned against framing the election as a straightforward endorsement of the prime minister.Kristi Govella, an associate professor at the University of Oxford, said it may be \"difficult\" to frame the vote as a referendum on Takaichi, given her relatively short time in office.\"If the LDP manages to gain a clear majority in this election, it will be entirely attributable to Takaichi's personal popularity—little else has changed since July when the LDP was drubbed at the polls,\" said Govella, who is also the Japan Chair at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.The LDP's electoral setbacks occurred under former Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, who called a snap election in 2024 after defeating Takaichi in the party leadership race. The party lost its Lower House majority then. Ishiba later resigned in September 2025 after the LDP also lost control of the Upper House in July.Economic pressuresEconomic pressures remain a backdrop for voters. Japan has endured inflation above the Bank of Japan's target for 45 consecutive months, declining real wages and persistent yen weakness.The most recent inflation reading stood at 2.1%, while full-year inflation reached 3.2%. Real wages fell for 11 consecutive months year-on-year in 2025, and on a yearly basis, real wages have fallen every year since 2022. A spike in rice prices in mid-2025 also weighed on household sentiment and contributed to the LDP's electoral struggles.The yen weakened further at the start of 2026, briefly approaching the 160 level against the U.S. dollar. While a weaker currency benefits exporters, it has also amplified imported inflation.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconSuzuki from the Institute of Geoeconomics said while the cost of living is a major issue, voters do not appear to be directly linking cost-of-living pressures to Takaichi's policies. \"[Voters] are concerned about inflation, but they seem to be discounting that... I think that they're fine for the most part with Ms Takaichi's press to be expansionary,\" said Ross Schaap, head of research at geopolitical risk firm GeoQuant.Takaichi had laid out a record $783 billion budget for the next fiscal year starting April 1, on top of a $135 billion stimulus package introduced last year to help households with rising living costs.A more unified oppositionDespite Takaichi's popularity, the ruling coalition faces a more unified opposition than in previous elections. Former coalition partner Komeito has joined forces with the Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan, the largest opposition bloc in the Lower House, to form a new centrist alliance.The LDP and Japan Innovation Party held a razor-thin majority before parliament was dissolved on Jan. 23 for the snap election, controlling 230 of the 465 seats in the Lower House. With three independents voting alongside the LDP, the ruling bloc's effective majority was just one seat.The loss of Komeito could prove costly, analysts said, as the party has historically played a crucial role in mobilizing voters for the LDP.That dynamic makes the election outcome highly uncertain, according to GeoQuant's Schaap.He said the new Centrist Reform Alliance could benefit from greater opposition coordination by pairing more pragmatic policy proposals from the CDP with Komeito's voter mobilization machinery.\"[Takaichi's] high approval is big, but opposition coordination is also really important, and the opposition coordination could overcome the high approval,\" Schaap said. \"Look for high turnout. If there's high turnout, it could be a good day for Takaichi. If there's not a high turnout, then it will be a close race.\"",

Denis Balibouse | ReutersGold and silver prices plunged on Friday, sparking a global sell-off of stocks and funds linked to the metals. By 5:04 a.m. ET, spot silver was down 15% to settle at around $98.66 per ounce — taking it back below the $100 milestone. Stock Chart IconStock chart iconSpot silverMeanwhile, spot gold shed 7% to trade at $5,009.46 an ounce.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconSpot goldPrices of the precious metals also faltered on futures exchanges, with front-month gold contracts losing 5.5% in New York, while silver futures for February delivery were down by 11%. The sell-off gripped the wider precious metals market, with spot platinum down more than 14%, while palladium fell close to 12%. On stock exchanges across the globe, the impact was also visible. In Europe, the regional Stoxx 600 Basic Resources index — which includes the continent's most valuable mining companies — was 3.2% lower in morning deals. London-listed Fresnillo, the world's biggest silver producer, was last seen 7% lower. In pre-market trade on Wall Street, silver miner Endeavour Silver was down 14.7%, while First Majestic Silver lost 14.4%. Silver ETFs were dragged into the action, with the ProShares Ultra Silver fund last seen 25% lower ahead of the opening bell. The iShares Silver Trust ETF lost 12.7%. Precious metals have been on a stellar rally over the past 12 months, amid broader market volatility, the decline of the U.S. dollar, bubbling geopolitical tensions and concerns about the independence of the Federal Reserve. Gold and silver both enjoyed record-smashing rallies in 2025, surging 65% and 150%, respectively, over the course of the year. Those gains have largely continued into 2026, with silver adding 37% while gold is up 15.4% year-to-date. 'Even good assets can sell-off'Katy Stoves, investment manager at British wealth management firm Mattioli Woods, told CNBC on Friday morning that the moves were likely \"a market-wide reassessment of concentration risk.\" \"Just as tech stocks — particularly AI-related names — have dominated market attention and capital flows, gold has similarly seen intense positioning and crowding,\" she said. \"When everyone is leaning the same way, even good assets can sell off as positions get unwound. The parallel isn't accidental: both represent areas where capital has flooded in based on powerful narratives, and concentrated positions eventually face their day of reckoning.\"Meanwhile, Toni Meadows, head of investment at BRI Wealth Management, argued that gold's run to the $5,000 mark had happened \"too easily.\" He noted that the unwinding of the greenback had supported gold prices, but that the dollar had appeared to stabilize. \"Central bank buying has driven the longer-term rally but this has tailed off in recent months,\" he said. \"The case for further reserve diversification is still there though as Trump's trade policies and intervention in foreign affairs will make a lot of countries nervous about holding U.S. assets, especially those countries in the emerging markets or aligned to China or Russia. Silver will mirror the direction of gold, so it is not surprising to see falls there.\"Claudio Wewel, FX strategist at J. Safra Sarasin Sustainable Asset Management, told CNBC's \"Squawk Box Europe\" on Friday that a \"perfect storm\" of geopolitical tensions had helped precious metals move higher this year, pointing to the U.S. capture of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and Washington's threats to use military force in Greenland and Iran.More recently, he said, speculation over who will be nominated as the next Fed chair has been influencing metal markets. Global investors are anticipating who will be nominated as the next chair of the Federal Reserve after U.S. President Donald Trump said he would announce a successor to Jerome Powell on Friday. Former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh, who served at the central bank during the 2008 Financial Crisis, is currently the favorite in prediction markets to secure the job.\"The market has clearly been pricing the risk of a much more dovish contender, that's been largely helping the gold price along with other precious metal prices. Over the last 24 hours, the news flow has changed a little bit,\" Wewel said. ",

Rachman said he will step down following a two-day market rout sparked by MSCI Inc.'s warning of a possible downgrade. Bloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesIndonesian stock exchange CEO Iman Rachman resigned on Friday, following a rout that saw the country's share market lose $84 billion over the past two days on concerns over a possible downgrade by index provider MSCI.In a release, the Indonesian Stock Exchange said Rachman had stepped down, taking responsibility for \"recent market condition,\" without elaborating. At a press conference Rachman said that \"I hope this is the best decision for the capital market. May my resignation lead to improvements in our capital market,\" according to Reuters.  \"Hopefully, the index, which opened positively this morning, will continue to improve in the coming days,\" he added. MSCI on Tuesday warned of a potential downgrade of the country to \"frontier\" market status, from emerging market by MSCI, highlighting concerns over trading transparency.   \"Investors highlighted that fundamental investability issues persist due to ongoing opacity in shareholding structures and concerns about possible coordinated trading behaviour that undermines proper price formation,\" MSCI said late Tuesday.The Jakarta Composite rose 1.18% on Friday, after losing 7.35% on Wednesday and another 1.06% on Thursday.A day before his resignation, Rachman told CNBC that Indonesian regulators had held discussions with MSCI, focused around enhancing data transparency, particularly around free float and ownership structures. watch nowOn Thursday, Indonesia's financial regulator said it would double the free float requirement on listed firms to 15%, responding to MSCI concerns about transparency on the country's stock exchange, according to Reuters. The IDX on Wednesday released a statement saying that it recognized the feedback by MSCI as a \"valuable part\" of its efforts aimed at enhancing the credibility of Indonesia's capital market. \"We are fully committed to making our best efforts to increase the weighting of Indonesian equities in the MSCI indices,\" IDX said. Speaking to CNBC's JP Ong, Pandu Sjahrir, chief investment officer at sovereign wealth fund Danatara, said that \"what happened the last two days is almost like a good cold plunge...the market kind of panicked a bit. And what happens after a cold plunge? Usually, you fix yourself up and you become refreshed.\"Indonesia's market has about one billion dollars in liquidity per day, Pandu said, adding that the market needed a liquidity of 8 to 10 times that amount. \"The only way to do it is through transparency. We have to be able to listen to what the market says, and don't be defensive.\"watch now",

Brendan Smialowski | AFP | Getty ImagesPresident Donald Trump, his two eldest sons, and his family business sued the Internal Revenue Service and the U.S. Treasury Department over alleged leaks of their confidential tax information, court records showed Thursday.The plaintiffs seek at least $10 billion in damages, according to the lawsuit in Miami federal court.The civil complaint alleges that the IRS and Treasury failed in their obligation to prevent the leak of those tax records by former IRS employee Charles \"Chaz\" Littlejohn in 2019 and 2020.In addition to Trump, the plaintiffs are his sons, Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump, and the Trump Organization, which the sons run.A spokesman for Trump's legal team told CNBC in a statement, \"The IRS wrongly allowed a rogue, politically-motivated employee to leak private and confidential information about President Trump, his family, and the Trump Organization to the New York Times, ProPublica and other left-wing news outlets, which was then illegally released to millions of people.\"\"President Trump continues to hold those who wrong America and Americans accountable,\" the spokesman said.The suit was filed three days after Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said he had cancelled all of his department's contracts with the consulting firm Booz Allen Hamilton in connection with the company's contractor, Littlejohn, stealing and leaking confidential tax returns.Read more CNBC politics coverageMan poses as FBI agent to try to free Luigi Mangione from jail, source saysTrump backs Senate government funding deal that includes DHS extensionSenate Ag Committee advances Republican crypto billSenators closing in on funding federal government less than two days from shutdownWatch live: Trump holds Cabinet meeting at White HouseHoman: ICE and CBP crafting drawdown plan in Minnesota, says improvements neededDenmark lauds talks with U.S. over Greenland: 'Now we are back on track'Government shutdown: Republicans mull escape hatch as Congress careens toward deadline'ICE is not a law unto itself,' Minnesota judge says after immigrant releasedLittlejohn, 40, is serving a five-year prison sentence after having pleaded guilty in October 2023 to one count of disclosure of tax return information.He admitted to leaking Trump's tax records to The New York Times, and also admitted to leaking records about wealthy individuals to the news outlet ProPublica.The news lawsuit says that Littlejohn, in a 2024 deposition, admitted disclosing \"Trump information [that] included all businesses that he had owned\" to the investigative news outlet ProPublica.The suit asserts that ProPublica's subsequent reporting on Trump's tax documents falsely claimed that the records contained \"versions of fraud.\"While that quote does appear in ProPublica's October 2019 report, it comes from Nancy Wallace, a finance and real estate professor at the University of California-Berkeley's Haas School of Business.Wallace was one of a dozen real estate professionals interviewed by ProPublica who said they saw no clear explanation for \"multiple inconsistencies in the documents,\" according to the report.\"Defendants have caused Plaintiffs reputational and financial harm, public embarrassment, unfairly tarnished their business reputations, portrayed them in a false light, and negatively affected President Trump, and the other Plaintiffs' public standing,\" the lawsuit says.It's all but unheard of for a sitting president to sue their own administration, and the exorbitant damages figure being demanded raises various conflict-of-interest questions.But Trump has reportedly made similar moves in the recent past: The New York Times reported in October that Trump sought $230 million from the Department of Justice as compensation for its past investigations into him.",

Tingshu Wang | ReutersThe U.S. deficit with its global trading partners nearly doubled in November as the shortfall with the European Union swelled and the impact of President Donald Trump's tariffs worked their way through the economy, the Census Bureau reported Thursday.Following a month where the trade deficit hit its lowest level since early 2009, it shot up to $56.8 billion, an increase of 94.6% from October. Of that gain, about one-third came with the European Union, where the goods deficit rose by $8.2 billion. The goods deficit with China decreased by about $1 billion to $13.9 billion.On a year-over-year basis, the deficit through November stood at $839.5 billion, or about 4% higher than the same period in 2024.The increase in the deficit counters Trump's efforts to use tariffs to reduce imbalances around the globe. When announcing so-called reciprocal tariffs in April 2025, the White House used the level of trade deficits with varying countries as a baseline for determining the duties.As the year went by, Trump softened his stance. A framework agreement between the U.S. and the EU in August put the tariff rate at 15% on most European goods and sought to stabilize relations between the two sides.Clarification: The headline on this story was updated to clarify that it was the trade deficit that soared 94% in November.",

    "body": "Apple CEO Tim Cook holds up a new iPhone 17 Pro during an Apple special event at Apple headquarters in Cupertino, California, Sept. 9, 2025.Justin Sullivan | Getty ImagesApple reported blowout first-quarter earnings on Thursday, and predicted growth of as much as 16% in the current quarter, matching the period that just ended. Sales could be even better, Apple said, if the company could secure enough chips to meet its customers' iPhone demands.\"We expect our March quarter total company revenue to grow by 13% to 16% year over year, which comprehends our best estimates of constrained iPhone supply during the quarter,\" finance chief Kevan Parekh told analysts on Thursday.On the company's earnings call, analysts asked CEO Tim Cook several questions about Apple's access to memory components, which have seen their prices skyrocket due to demand related to chips necessary for artificial intelligence data centers. That has caused a memory shortage. Instead of dwelling on memory, Cook focused on rising demand and the company's lean inventory. He said that what's keeping Apple from making more iPhones is access to advanced node manufacturing for its A-series and M-series chips, which the company calls SoCs, or a system-on-chip.Apple manufactures its advanced node chips with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., which dominates the market for leading node manufacturing. Apple said on Thursday that it was seeking manufacturing on the company's 3-nanometer node. \"The constraints that we have are driven by the availability of the advanced nodes that our SoCs are produced on, and at this time, we're seeing less flexibility in supply chain than normal, partly because of our increased demand,\" Cook said. Cook said Apple is in the process of increasing its access to supply and didn't want to forecast beyond March.Although this quarter's supply shortage is related to advanced node chip manufacturing, Cook acknowledged that Apple would be affected by rising memory prices, and that the company was looking at \"a range of options\" for what it could do. But he declined to talk about the specifics of how Apple is grappling with the AI-driven shortage that is affecting nearly every device maker in the world. \"As always, we'll look at a range of options to deal with that,\" Cook said. Apple said it expects gross margins to be between 48% and 49% in the March quarter, which at the midpoint would be a larger gross margin than in the December quarter. Cook said that rising memory prices had a \"minimal impact\" on Apple in the December quarter but would have a bigger effect in the March quarter. Last year, Apple announced it would spend over $600 billion in the U.S. over five years, with a big chunk of that going toward a handful of companies who have committed to build chips in America, including TSMC, which has historically done most of its manufacturing in Taiwan. On Thursday, Cook said Apple had sourced 20 billion chips from the U.S. in 2025, higher than the company's previous target of 19 billion U.S. chips.

    "body": "China's President Xi Jinping (R) and Britain's Prime Minister Keir Starmer shake hands before their meeting at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing on January 29, 2026.Carl Court | Afp | Getty ImagesBEIJING — Countries that shunned China during its trade dispute with the U.S. are now sending their leaders to Beijing for meetings with Chinese President Xi Jinping — and are keen to strike business deals.At least five national leaders, including British Prime Minister Keir Starmer and Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, have visited Xi in January alone. Uruguay's President Yamandú Orsi is due to make the trip next week — the first by a South American leader since U.S. President Donald Trump captured Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro and his wife in early January. The Canadian and British leaders' trips are the first in at least eight years, while a visit by Ireland's prime minister on Jan. 5 was the first in 14 years. China had closed its borders during the Covid-19 pandemic and only reopened them in earnest in early 2023.\"These visits reflect managed, selective resets under rising U.S. policy uncertainty, rather than a strategic pivot to China,\" said Yue Su, principal economist at the Economist Intelligence Unit.\"Keeping communication channels open with Beijing is increasingly seen as preferable to disengagement,\" she said, \"particularly as the gains from selective resets with China become more visible, and U.S. policy has grown less predictable.\"Since taking office 12 months ago, Trump has wielded tariffs not just on China but a slew of U.S. trading partners. In recent months, he's increased efforts to ramp up U.S. influence over Venezuela, Iran and Greenland. It's an opportunity for Beijing, which has sought to portray itself as not only a partner for developing countries but also as a stabilizing force for the world. watch now\"Maintaining distance from the United States indicates that these countries value ties with China's large economy,\" Cui Shoujun, an international studies professor at Renmin University of China, said in a phone interview Thursday. That's according to a CNBC translation of his Mandarin-language remarks.European and other countries may still need to align with the U.S. on security issues, but they are now increasing economic engagement, Cui said. Facilitating business dealsLarge business delegations often accompany national leaders when making state visits. Nearly 60 British companies and cultural organizations sent representatives to accompany the U.K. prime minister on his China trip. British pharmaceutical giant AstraZeneca used the state visit to announce plans to invest $15 billion in China through 2030.Similarly, during Carney's visit, Canada agreed to cut tariffs on a limited number of China-made electric cars to 6.1% from 100%, in exchange for lower Chinese tariffs on Canadian canola seeds. Global businesses have also long been keen to sell to China's large consumer market, the second-largest in the world. For their part, Chinese leaders have urged visiting nations to create fair environments for Chinese businesses operating or investing locally. Many Chinese companies, such as electric car makers, have accelerated global expansion plans as domestic growth has slowed.Beijing has increasingly made clear its efforts to build technological self-sufficiency and hold its own on the global stage.Earlier this month, the head of the ruling Chinese Communist Party's international affairs department wrote in the official party newspaper that China's modernization efforts break a \"Western-centric\" model and gives developing countries a new choice.U.S.-China still hold cloutBut the overarching question remains tensions between the world's two largest economies. Some of the visiting nations still count the U.S., not China, as their largest trading partner.The five countries with leaders who visited in January — Ireland, South Korea, Canada and Finland — have a combined gross domestic product of $8.71 trillion, or less than half of China's $18.74 trillion GDP, as of 2024 World Bank figures. The U.S. remained far larger with a GDP of $28.75 trillion.China was the first major economy to retaliate against Trump's \"Liberation Day\" tariffs in April 2025. The two countries reached a fragile one-year trade truce in late October, with Trump expected to visit China in April. The American Chamber of Commerce in China hosted an appreciation dinner on Thursday evening in Beijing while Starmer was visiting, which included representatives from the Chinese side. In an opening address, Chair James Zimmerman urged both Trump and Xi to create a vision for greater global stability. The potential for the two leaders to meet as many as four times this year marks \"a moment for sustained leadership and meaningful progress that should not be missed,\" Zimmerman said. \n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tWeekly analysis and insights from Asia's largest economy in your inbox\n\t\t\tSubscribe now\n\t\t\n\tOne of the opportunities for Trump and Xi to meet — as well as draw other world leaders to China — is the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, which China is hosting this year. The APEC forum is set to hold a senior officials' meeting in the southern Chinese city of Guangzhou early next month, ahead of the main economic leaders' meeting in November. But visiting leaders still must straddle a fine balance when dealing with China.This week, Trump threatened 100% tariffs on Canada if Ottawa \"makes a deal\" with China and said it was \"very dangerous\" for Britain to do business with China. In a nod toward European industry interests, French President Emmanuel Macron threatened China with tariffs a day after he returned from his state visit in December. \"These trips are a hedging strategy,\" said Jack Lee, a foreign affairs analyst at consultancy China Macro Group. \"They keep the China channel open as a way to preserve strategic optionality,\" he said. But he cautioned that trust, especially between the EU and Beijing, remains limited. ",

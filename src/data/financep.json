    "body": "In 2019, Chanel Rivers took a trip to London that would change the entire trajectory of her life.Born and raised in New York, Rivers, now 35, says she was tired of the dating scene and worrying about her safety in the Big Apple. She booked a trip to London with a friend and realized how comfortable she felt walking around the city, something she no longer felt in New York.\"I remember just walking around London and being like, 'I feel like this is where I'm supposed to be.' It was a feeling that came over me,\" Rivers says. \"In London, I just feel like my anxiety has lessened a lot, which is great.\"Shortly after Rivers got back to New York, she started figuring out how to return to London permanently, but the Covid-19 pandemic brought her plans to a complete halt. During the pandemic, Rivers met her now fiancé, Martin, an architect from Canada who was living and working in New York.Rivers was born and raised in New York.Chanel RiversAfter four and a half years of dating, Rivers brought up moving to London again to her fiancé. She admits that the feeling of wanting to move didn't go away, and she didn't see herself being in New York long-term anymore.\"I considered Canada, and we did look at Vancouver, but it was not city enough for me. Being from New York, I needed a big city. London was always the plan for me in my heart,\" she says.Around the same time that Rivers brought up getting the move to London going, her fiancé's job offered him a position in their office there. It was something she says was \"very serendipitous but meant to be.\"Since Martin was already a U.K. citizen, Rivers only needed to apply for a partner visa, which was approved in March 2024.Chanel is part of small but growing trend of Americans relocating to the U.K. More than 6,000 U.S. citizens applied to either become British subjects or to live and work in the country indefinitely from March 2024 to March 2025, the most since the U.K.'s Home Office began keeping records in 2004, according to The Guardian.Hello, LondonIn October 2024, the couple moved into a two-bedroom, one-bathroom apartment with a private garden in West London without ever seeing it in person. The rent was 2,400 pounds or USD $3,159 when they first moved in and has since increased to 2,515.20 pounds or $3,311, according to documents reviewed by CNBC Make It.The apartment was unfurnished, in a townhouse rather than a larger building, and didn't have a doorman, unlike the modern one they lived in back in New York City. The couple didn't ship any of their furniture over because it was too expensive. The first night they spent in the apartment, they slept in sleeping bags on the floor and used their suitcases as a dining table.\"We wanted something with character. We told ourselves we wanted something different when we moved here and we wanted something that felt very London so that we had a different living experience than we did in the U.S.,\" Rivers says.Rivers, her fiancé and their dog moved to London in October 2024.Chanel RiversRivers was able to keep her $120,000 a year job in event planning and marketing through the end of 2024.After that, she started looking for a position in London, which she says helped her explore the city as she traveled for interviews and worked out of local coffee shops. Rivers says she never had homesickness or regretted the move, but she admits that she was still nervous about being in a new city. \"I was so intimidated by London because it's so big and I was kind of scared to go out on my own. I don't know what happened to that brave girl from 2019, but I guess everything just felt so real now, and it was hitting me,\" she adds.One year later and the cost of living in LondonNow that Rivers and her fiancé have lived in London for a little over a year, they have settled in nicely, she says. Rivers found a London-based job working as an event planner. Rivers did not want to disclose her salary, but says that although she did take a pay cut, she's happy with it and spends less money than she did while living in New York. \"I've found that I generally spend less now, mostly because I'm not socializing as much as I did in New York. In London, life is a bit quieter but in a good way,\" she says. \"I still make time to see new friends and meet new people but I go out less. Plus, since I earn less here, I'm more mindful about where my money goes.\"Rivers and her fiancé also split their expenses proportionally based on their incomes. \"My fiancé makes the equivalent of what he made in the U.S., so he's kind of carrying the team right now, which is great,\" she adds.Rivers and her fiancé moved into an apartment without seeing it in person.Chanel RiversRivers' share of the monthly living expenses breakdown is as follows, according to documents reviewed by CNBC Make It:Rent = 1,215 pounds or $1,599Cellphone = 49.70 pounds or $65Internet/Wi-Fi = 20 pounds or $26Water = 59.78 pounds or $79Electricity = 121 pounds or $159Groceries = 300 pounds or $395Transportation = 115 pounds or $151Amazon Prime = 8.99 pounds or $12Pet insurance = 25.21 pounds or $33Apple TV = $12.99Rivers' biggest monthly expenses are rent, groceries and electricity, she says. She commutes to the office three times a week and tends to buy lunch on those days. Since moving to London, Rivers and her fiancé say they have also been able to take advantage of the city's location by taking local day trips on the train and traveling to Ireland and Mallorca. \"It's really nice to have easier access to traveling. I feel like in the U.S., you go on a trip once a year and that's it. It's nice that we can hop on a train and go to Paris for a night or hop on a plane and go to Spain,\" she says. \"The traveling is also a big part of why we wanted to move. Despite it taking a while to get settled, Rivers says she feels they made the right decision.\"I've only felt like this is the right path and where I'm supposed to be. Even the mundane things I do here excite me,\" she says. \"I feel like I'm probably in a honeymoon phase but I feel every day that I made the right choice. I don't think I see myself living in the U.S. now that I know what it's like to live a lifestyle outside of that.\"Rivers says she doesn't see herself moving back to the U.S.Chanel RiversRivers says moving back to the U.S. probably isn't in the cards for her, but she could eventually get on board with moving to Canada after living out her London dream for a few more years. \"Canada wasn't as exciting for where I'm at in life right now. I wanted something a little bit more exciting, like New York, but different. I think when I get older, if we were to move back and we wanted to be closer to family, then Canada would be the place we move to,\" she says.Conversions from British Pounds to USD were done using the OANDA conversion rate of 0.76 pounds to $1 USD on Nov. 11, 2025.

    "body": "With the rising cost of groceries, rent and other essentials, having money to set aside and save can feel impossible. However, saving doesn't always require more money — you might just need to reorganize what you already have, says Kashif Ahmed, a certified financial planner and lecturer at Suffolk University in Boston. Ahmed, who teaches a finance class to undergraduate students, says many of his students tell him they want to save more, but say they lack the funds to start. That tracks with national data: Nearly 75% of Gen Z adults reported having $1,000 or less saved, according to a Self Financial survey of over 2,000 adults in July. But often, \"the money is there, you just have to go look for it,\" Ahmed says. Here's where he recommends starting.How to reorganize your spendingAhmed's advice: Start by writing down every dollar you spend and sincerely looking at it.When looking through your list, ask yourself which expenses were absolutely necessary and which expenses were simply \"wants.\" For example, he says, do you really need two lattes a day or five different streaming services? Sometimes, it may be smart to bring in a third-party auditor — someone like a parent or friend who isn't emotionally invested in your purchases — who can identify places to cut spending and save instead. Even packing a meal instead of buying lunch once a week can be a great way to get started, Ahmed says. \"Financial security is absolutely possible,\" he says. \"It's all about discipline.\"It's OK to make fun purchasesSaving money doesn't necessarily mean you have to cut out all purchases that may bring joy or stick to a tight budget limited to essential items.Sometimes, a restrictive budget may even backfire on you, leading to periods of spending binges, Suze Orman, personal finance expert and host of the podcast \"Women & Money (and Everyone Smart Enough to Listen),\" told the Wall Street Journal in 2024.Instead, Orman said to try focusing on smaller, everyday decisions that can make you feel more in control of your spending. \"Just do one thing that might make you feel more secure,\" Orman said. \"Is that saving $10? Is that not going out to eat?\"Black Friday sale: Want to up your AI skills and be more productive? Get 25% off our most popular course of the year, How to Use AI to Be More Successful at Work, with coupon code GETSMART.

    "body": "Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-CA)Yuri Gripas | ReutersRep. Eric Swalwell, D-Calif., filed a 19-page lawsuit Tuesday in U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C., alleging Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Bill Pulte abused his authority to make \"fanciful\" mortgage fraud allegations against him and other critics of President Donald Trump.The lawsuit asks the court to declare Pulte's conduct unlawful, order him and the FHFA to withdraw a criminal mortgage fraud referral, and award damages for violations of federal privacy law.Swalwell — who announced Friday that he is running for governor of California — alleges in the complaint that Pulte improperly accessed and leaked his private mortgage records in retaliation for his political speech, violating both the Privacy Act of 1974 and the First Amendment.\"Director Pulte has combed through private records of political opponents to silence them,\" Swalwell posted in a statement on X.The suit alleges Pulte's referral of the matter to the Justice Department was \"patently false,\" noting that Swalwell had sworn in an affidavit that his Washington, D.C., home would be his wife's primary residence and that he remained a California resident.Swalwell's lawyers note in the filing that the disclosures landed just as Swalwell prepared to launch his gubernatorial bid. The leak of Pulte's referral letter to the media occurred \"with remarkable speed,\" the suit states, followed by conservative commentators posting details about his home where his wife and children live, activity Swalwell's suit says increased security risks for his family.The filing casts Pulte's actions as part of a broader effort by the Trump administration to use federal agencies and the courts against political opponents. Swalwell, a seven-term congressman and former House impeachment manager during Trump's second impeachment, has long been one of the most vocal critics of the president. \"Pulte's brazen practice of obtaining confidential mortgage records from Fannie Mae and/or Freddie Mac and then using them as a basis for referring individual homeowners to DOJ for prosecution is unprecedented and unlawful,\" the lawsuit argues. In recent months, Pulte has issued similar criminal referrals to Swalwell's to other Trump critics, among them New York Attorney General Letitia James, Sen. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., and Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook. James' indictment was dismissed by a federal judge Monday while Schiff faces an ongoing probe though has not been charged. Cook also has not been charged, though Trump cited the criminal referral as cause in his attempt to fire her from the board of governors for the Federal Reserve in August. The firing is currently on hold pending a Supreme Court review.Pulte defended his agency's criminal referral of Cook to CNBC in August, saying it wasn't politically motivated. \"We make referrals almost every day. Lisa Cook happened to be one of them,\" he said.In an interview with \"Squawk Box\" in September, Pulte refused to tell host Andrew Ross Sorkin where the tip came from.\"I'm not going to explain our sources and methods, where we get tips from, who are whistleblowers,\" Pulte said.Swalwell's lawsuit says no comparable FHFA criminal referrals have been made against Trump allies. There is evidence that top Trump officials like Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent made mortgage claims similar to ones Trump cited to try to fire Cook.Spokespeople for the FHFA and DOJ did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment.",

    "body": "Coffee prices were already rising following poor harvests last year when the U.S. added new tariffs on coffee imports in April. Those tariffs have since been rolled back, but prices at grocery stores and cafés are still high, leaving many shoppers wondering why a simple cup of coffee costs so much.As of September, roasted coffee sold in stores cost about 41% more than it did 12 months prior, rising from an average of $6.47 to $9.14 per pound, according to the most recent Bureau of Labor Statistics data.While prices can swing by roughly a dollar within a year during volatile periods, the nearly $3 increase in the most recent BLS data is unusually steep — and consumers are taking notice.\"This is ridiculous,\" 52-year-old Chuck Smith said in a TikTok video in August in which he showed receipts for the 38.2-ounce tub of Maxwell House ground coffee he buys at his local Walmart in Indiana, which had nearly doubled in price to $21.44 in under a year.Smith says he filmed the clip spontaneously in the grocery aisle after noticing the price hike. \"It was just me in the moment,\" he told CNBC Make It, adding that the reaction \"captured what a lot of folks are feeling.\" Walmart and Kraft Heinz, the maker of Maxwell House, did not respond to requests for comment. Other brands, including Nespresso and Folgers, have also increased prices in the last year.Restaurant coffee prices have risen, too: The average cost of a regular cup increased from $3.46 to $3.57 in the year ending October 2025, according to restaurant and café price data tracked by menu software company Toast.What's behind the biggest coffee price spike in decadesThe run-up in average retail coffee prices has been the steepest and most sustained since BLS began tracking those prices in 1980, the data shows.Weather issues came first. Drought and heavy rain disrupted harvests in Brazil and Vietnam in 2024, tightening supply well before tariffs took effect.Coffee futures prices then climbed from roughly $2 a pound in May 2024 to a peak of $4 by April 2025, one of the steepest increases the market has seen in decades, according to Intercontinental Exchange data. Because futures serve as the benchmark for what importers and roasters pay for beans, sharp increases often lead to higher costs, which may eventually show up in retail prices.Tariffs are another factor. In April, the U.S. imposed new tariffs on coffee imports — 10% on key coffee-growing Latin American countries and about 20% for Asian growers, with Brazil hit hardest at 50%. Since then, grocery-store coffee prices have risen about 21%, according to consumer price index data.In mid-November, the White House rolled back most of the new coffee tariffs, eliminating duties for nearly all producing countries except Brazil, which retained a 40% tariff. Last week, the administration removed the remaining 40% duty on Brazilian coffee as well, effectively ending tariffs on coffee imports from almost all major exporters.Because retail prices typically lag wholesale costs, it may take time before any easing shows up on store shelves. Still, removing tariffs should eventually help take some pressure off prices, according to the National Coffee Association, an industry trade group.\"Significant coffee price inflation has occurred during the time tariffs have been in place,\" a spokesperson for NCA tells CNBC Make It. \"Removing tariffs on the world's leading coffee producing countries is expected to significantly decrease costs.\"Black Friday sale: Want to up your AI skills and be more productive? Get 25% off our most popular course of the year, How to Use AI to Be More Successful at Work, with coupon code GETSMART.

    "body": "Alibaba announced plans to release a pair of smart glasses powered by its AI models. The Quark AI Glasses are Alibaba's first foray into the smart glasses product category.AlibabaAlibaba's artificial intelligence-powered smart glasses went on sale on Thursday as the Chinese tech giant looks to ramp up its focus on consumer AI in an increasingly competitive market. The Quark AI Glasses, first announced in July, come in two variants — the S1, which starts at  3,799 Chinese yuan ($536) and G1 at 1,899 yuan.The tech giant has integrated its Qwen AI models — Alibaba's version of ChatGPT — with the device which also links to its newly-launched Qwen app. This means users can use voice control to get the glasses to carry out tasks.The lenses of the glasses are effectively screens and the device has a camera built into the frame. The main difference between the S1 and G1 is the display, Alibaba said.watch nowThe company said that some of the features include on-the-go translation, AI-generated meeting notes and the ability to ask the virtual assistants questions. Users take pictures of a product using the camera in the lens and then the device will show the price of that product on Taobao, Alibaba's main shopping app in China. Alibaba, like other technology companies such as U.S. giant Meta, are betting that smart glasses could be the next big consumer device after the smartphone.In September, Meta unveiled the $799 Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses, the social media company's first consumer-ready smart glasses with a built-in display. Users can control the device via hand gestures with a special wristband. Alibaba's glasses will initially go on sale in China and compete with domestic rivals, including consumer electronics maker Xiaomi and startup Xreal. The smart glasses market is still small but growing rapidly. By 2026, shipments of AI glasses are expected to exceed more than 10 million units, doubling from 2025, according to a forecast from Omdia. For Alibaba, the glasses are its latest play in the consumer AI market as it looks to build on its recent successes. The company's ChatGPT-style Qwen app got 10 million downloads in the first week of the public beta launch. Meanwhile, Alibaba's cloud computing business, where it books much of its AI-relate revenue, saw an acceleration of growth in the last quarter.The Hangzhou, headquartered company is one of the leaders in China's AI space, and has been investing aggressively in AI alongside rival giants like Baidu and Tencent, and aggressively launching new models.",

A deflator measures how inflation affects the value of total output.A Reuters poll of economists had pegged the July-September gross domestic product at 7.3%.India's nominal GDP — which does not account for inflation or deflation — grew 8.7% in the September quarter compared to 8.8% in the previous quarter.The sharp improvement in GDP growth rate was on account of a pick up in manufacturing and construction activity and domestic consumption. Financial and real estate professional services have \"sustained a substantial growth rate\" of 10.2% in Jul-Sep, the government said in a release. watch nowDuring the September quarter, domestic consumption was \"held back\" ahead of the planned cuts to the goods and services tax, Neelkanth Mishra, chief economist at Axis Bank, told CNBC's \"Inside India\" before the release of the GDP data.The 50% tariffs on Indian goods exported to the U.S. took effect in August. To cushion the impact, New Delhi announced sweeping GST tax reductions effective Sept. 22 to boost domestic consumption.Demand picked up sharply in October, with record sales of autos and gold as the GST cuts and earlier reduction of the individual income tax rate lifted disposable incomes. Even so, India's goods trade deficit hit a new high on weak exports and higher gold imports.The International Monetary Fund, in a report on Wednesday, said India's real GDP is projected to grow 6.6% in fiscal 2026 before moderating to 6.2% in fiscal 2027, assuming a prolonged delay in a U.S.-India trade deal.It also forecasted India's merchandise exports to fall 5.8% in fiscal year 2026 to $416 billion, while goods imports are expected to rise 2.4% to $746 billion.\"Despite external headwinds, growth is expected to remain robust, supported by favorable domestic conditions,\" the IMF said in the release, with its data also suggesting that India will become a $5 trillion economy by fiscal year 2029.— CNBC's Amitoj Singh contributed to this report.",

    "body": "Disney's \"Zootopia 2\" follows detectives Judy Hopps and Nick Wilde find themselves on the twisting trail of a mysterious reptile who turns the mammal metropolis of Zootopia upside down.DisneyMoviegoers have plenty to feast on at the box office this Thanksgiving.Disney's \"Zootopia 2\" snared $10.2 million in Tuesday previews, the second-highest haul for a Disney Animation Studios film ever, behind only last year's \"Moana 2,\" which took in $13.8 million. It's the eighth-highest preview for an animated movie of all time. Box office analysts expect the film to generate between $135 million and $150 million during the five-day Thanksgiving period. Although that will be significantly below the $225.4 million that \"Moana 2\" took in during the same period last year, it is a welcome jolt for a box office that has struggled in the last few months to drum up ticket sales.Also in the mix is Universal's \"Wicked: For Good,\" which tallied $147 million during its opening last week and is expected to bring in between $80 million and $100 million over the five-day holiday. That figure could be higher considering last year's \"Wicked\" tallied $118 million during the Thanksgiving frame after debuting to $112.5 million during the same pre-Thanksgiving weekend.\"The Thanksgiving holiday frame is one of the most important moviegoing periods of the year and is off to a running start with the overperforming 'Wicked: For Good' powering an impressive five days of box office revenue for movie theaters in the $300 million range,\" said Paul Dergarabedian, head of marketplace trends at Comscore. \"'Zootopia 2' has a perfect release date and built-in brand recognition and a revenue enhancing PG rating so that's a huge plus.\"Thanksgiving this year is facing tough comparisons after the 2024 holiday saw \"Moana 2,\" \"Wicked\" and \"Gladiater II\" fuel a record-breaking $424.9 million domestic five-day score. Previously, the highest-grossing Thanksgiving haul was $315.6 million, which was captured in 2018, according to data from Comscore.\"While that record is in no jeopardy of being broken, this year will nonetheless prove to be a solid Thanksgiving holiday corridor for movie theaters that will likely rank in the top five performing frames historically of all time,\" said Dergarabedian.Disclosure: Comcast is the parent company of NBCUniversal, which owns CNBC. Versant would become the new parent company of CNBC upon Comcast's planned spinoff of Versant.",

    "body": "A general view of the Baidu logo is seen at the Shanghai New Expo Center during the World Artificial Intelligence Conference 2025 in Shanghai, China, on July 28, 2025.Ying Tang | Nurphoto | Getty ImagesTech giant Baidu is emerging as one of China's key artificial intelligence chip players, positioning itself as a challenger to Huawei as both look to fill the void left by industry leader Nvidia being kept out of the country. Best-known as China's biggest search business, Baidu has in recent years refocused its business around driverless cars and AI, including a majority-owned subsidiary, Kunlunxin, which designs chips.Several analysts have upgraded their outlook on Baidu's stock over the past few weeks, citing the semiconductor business and forecasting the unit will gain more domestic orders.This month, Baidu laid out a five-year roadmap for its Kunlun AI chips, beginning with the M100 in 2026 and the M300 in 2027. The company already uses a mix of its self-developed chips in its data centers to run its ERNIE AI models, as well as Nvidia products. Baidu makes money by selling its chips to third parties building data centers as well as renting out computing capacity via its cloud. It has sought to position itself as a so-called \"full stack\" AI offering with infrastructure made up of chips, servers and data centers, as well as AI models and applications.And the chip business appears to be gaining traction. Earlier this year, Kunlunxin won orders from suppliers to China Mobile, one of the country's biggest mobile carriers.\"Kunlunxin has emerged as a leading domestic AI chip developer, focusing on high- performance AI chips for large language model (LLM) training and inference, cloud  computing, and telecom and enterprise workloads,\" analysts at Deutsche Bank said in a note this month.While Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) are widely regarded as the most advanced chips for training and running AI, the company has been blocked by the U.S. government from selling its top-end product to China. Beijing has also reportedly been persuading local tech companies not to buy the H20, a less powerful Nvidia chip designed for the Chinese market and greenlit for export.With Huawei — the leading player through its massive clusters of chips — out of the picture, analysts are suggesting Baidu will fill the void and its chip business is set for explosive growth.\"We believe domestic demand for AI compute in China remains intense, and hyperscalers are increasingly sourcing from local solution providers,\" JPMorgan said in a note on Sunday. \"We view Kunlun AI chip as one of the best positioned.\"The investment bank analysts forecast Baidu chips sales to increase six-fold to reach 8 billion Chinese yuan ($1.1 billion) in 2026.Analysts at Macquarie estimate that Baidu's Kunlun chip unit could be valued at about $28 billion. Baidu is not alone among China's tech giants when it comes to self-developed semiconductors. CNBC reported in August that Alibaba is also developing its next-generation AI chip. AI chip shortages hit ChinaBaidu's chip push comes as Chinese tech giants this month said they're seeing supply shortages.Eddie Wu, CEO of Alibab, said that \"the supply side is going to be a relatively large bottleneck\" over the next two-to-three years, referring to components and chips required to build data centers. Tencent said this month that its 2025 capital expenditure would be lower than initially anticipated. But Tencent President Martin Lau said this this was not because of a lack of demand, but more a shortage of available chips to spend the money on. \"It is not a reflection of our change in AI strategy ... It is indeed a change in terms of the AI chip availability,\" Lau said. watch nowPart of this shortage has been driven by global demand and resulting bottlenecks in the semiconductor supply chain. But China's effective block of Nvidia chips has also reduced the supply.Chinese tech firms have tried to mitigate the shortage by using stockpiled chips, as well as trying to make their AI models more efficient to do more with the semiconductors they have.Meanwhile, China has its own challenges with manufacturing because its biggest chipmaker SMIC, is unable to compete on the scale and technology with leaders like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. That makes it hard for the China to manufacture enough domestic chips to fill the shortfall. Like their U.S. counterparts, Chinese tech companies have continually reported strong demand for AI. \"We see that customer demand for AI is and remains very strong. In fact, we are not even able to keep pace with the growth in customer demand … in terms of the pace at which we can deploy new servers,\" Alibaba's Wu said this week. That gives Baidu an opportunity in China.\"Baidu's chip push is both a necessity and an opportunity. It's a necessity, because Chinese platforms can no longer assume a steady diet of US GPUs; opportunity, because there's now a semi‑captive, multi‑billion‑dollar domestic market for AI hardware that is compliant with both US export rules and Beijing's self‑reliance agenda,\" Nick Patience, practice lead for AI at The Futurum Group, told CNBC.\"If Baidu can ship competitive Kunlun generations on time, it doesn't just solve its own supply problem — it becomes a strategic supplier to the rest of China's AI industry.\"",

Seoul's move follows similar actions by the U.S., UK, and Singapore.In a statement Thursday, South Korea's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that the measures mark the country's first independent sanctions regarding transnational crime and the \"largest single sanction measure in history,\" according to a Google translation.\"It shows the government's firm determination to actively respond to online organized crime in Southeast Asia that is causing serious damage at home and abroad,\" the statement added.

Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff captured the excitement around Gemini 3 with a Sunday post on X, saying that despite using OpenAI's ChatGPT daily for three years, he wasn't going back after two hours of using Gemini 3. \"The leap is insane,\" wrote Benioff, whose company has partnerships with Google, OpenAI and other frontier AI model providers. \"Everything is sharper and faster.

Shares of the Google parent surged more than 5% on Monday, adding to last week's gain of more than 8%. Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway revealed earlier this month that it owns a $4.3 billion stake in Alphabet as of the end of the third quarter. Alphabet shares are up nearly 70% this year and have outperformed Meta's by more than 50 percentage points this year, and last week, Alphabet's market cap surpassed Microsoft's.All of this came despite Nvidia reporting stronger-than-expect revenue and guidance in its third-quarter earnings last week.\"You may be asking why almost all of the AI stocks we cover are selling off after such good news from Nvidia,\" Melius Research analyst Ben Reitzes wrote in a note Monday, referring to Nvidia's positive third quarter earnings last week. \"There is one real reason for worry and it is the 'AI comeback' of Alphabet.\" But while Google appears to have regained the edge, its lead over rivals remains razor thin in the gruelingly competitive AI market, experts said. Sundar Pichai, chief executive officer of Alphabet Inc., during the Bloomberg Tech conference in San Francisco, California, US, on Wednesday, June 4, 2025. David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesPutting the pieces togetherWith Gemini 3 and Ironwood, Google CEO Sundar Pichai appears to have finally put the pieces together for the company's AI offerings, said Michael Nathanson, co-founder of equity research firm Moffett Nathanson. Google is serving a broad range of customers from consumers to enterprise, something the company initially struggled to do after the arrival of ChatGPT. \"Three years ago, they were seen as kind of lost and there were all these hot takes saying they lost their way and Sundar is a failure,\" Nathanson said. \"Now, they have a huge leg up.\"The company had a number of AI product mishaps in its initial attempts to catch up with OpenAI. In 2024 alone, Google had to pull its image generation product Imagen 2 for several months after users discovered a number of historical inaccuracies. The launch of AI Overviews caused a similar reaction when users discovered it gave faulty advice, which the company later remedied with additional guardrails.\"There was a lot of fumbling, and they were scrambling,\" said Gil Luria, managing director at technology research firm DA Davidson. \"But they had the tech in the pantry, and it was just a matter of getting it all together and shipped.\"Of particular note is how quickly Google launched Gemini 3 after the spring release of Gemini 2.5, which was already considered an impressive model. The hyper-realistic image generation features of Nano Banana is another notch in Google's belt. After the company initially launched the image generation tool, Gemini shot to the top of the Apple App Store in September, dethroning ChatGPT. And after the launch of Gemini 3, Google released Nano Banana Pro last week. Google's ownership of YouTube and all the content on the video platform gives the company an edge when it comes to training models for image and video generation. \"The amount of video and current data that Google has, that's really a huge competitive advantage,\" said Mike Gualtieri, vice president and principal analyst for Forrester Research. \"I don't see how OpenAI and Anthropic can overcome that.\"Additionally, Google has successfully incorporated its AI models into its enterprise products, driving sales for the company's cloud unit. In its third quarter earnings results last month, Google reached its first $100 billion quarter, boosted by its cloud growth. The company's cloud unit, which houses its AI services, showed solid growth and a $155 billion backlog from customers. And it's not just the AI models. Google is also garnering attention with its AI chips. Google says Ironwood is nearly 30 times more power efficient than its first TPU from 2018. Google's ASIC chips are emerging as the company's secret weapon in the AI wars and have helped it notch recent deals worth billions with customers such as Anthropic. After a report said that Meta could strike a deal with Google to use its TPUs for the social media company's data centers, Nvidia saw its stock drop 3% on Tuesday, prompting the chipmaker to post a response on social media. With the rise of Google's TPUs, Nvidia may no longer have the AI chips market cornered.\"The advantage of having the whole stack is you can optimize your model to work specifically well on a TPU chip and you're building everything to a more optimally designed,\" said Luria.The company's ability to serve AI enterprise customers with its TPUs and Google Cloud offerings as well as its incorporation of Gemini 3 throughout its consumer products is driving Wall Street's enthusiasm.Experts who spoke with CNBC said the competitive landscape is broader than just one AI winner, but they added that it's become increasingly expensive for multiple companies to prove success.Tight competitionDespite these wins, Google is still in fierce competition with other AI companies, experts said.\"Having the state of the art model for a few days doesn't mean they've won to the extent that the stock market is implying,\" Luria said, pointing to Anthropic's new Opus 4.5 model launched Monday. Earlier this month, OpenAI also announced two updates to its GPT-5 model to make it \"warmer by default and more conversational\" as well as \"more efficient and easier to understand in everyday use,\" the company said. \"The frontier models still seem to be neck and neck in some ways,\" Forrester Research's Gualtieri said.The competitive edge will likely go to the companies willing to spend more money given the expenses of the AI race, experts said. In their earnings reports last month, Alphabet, Meta, Microsoft and Amazon each lifted their guidance for capital expenditures. They collectively expect that number to reach more than $380 billion this year.\"These companies are spending a lot of money assuming there's gonna be a winner take all when in reality we may end up with frontier models being a commodity and several will be interchangeable,\" Luria said.For Google, maintaining a lead in AI won't be without challenges. Company executives told employees earlier this month that Google has to double its serving capacity every six month to meet demand for AI services and run its frontier models, CNBC reported last week. \"The competition in AI infrastructure is the most critical and also the most expensive part of the AI race,\" Google Cloud Vice President Amin Vahdat told employees.Although Google's in-house TPUs have gotten increased attention as viable alternatives to Nvidia's Blackwell chips, Nvidia still holds more than 90% of the AI chip market. In its post on Tuesday, Nvidia pointed out that its chips are more flexible and powerful than ASIC chips, like Google's Ironwood, which are typically designed for a single company or function.And despite getting Salesforce's Benioff to switch to Gemini, Google also has a lot of catching up to do with its consumer chat product, experts said, citing hallucinations and lower user numbers than OpenAI's.The Gemini app has 650 million monthly active users and AI Overviews has 2 billion monthly users, Google said last month. OpenAI, by comparison, said in August that ChatGPT hit 700 million users per week.  \"Yes, Google has got its act together,\" Luria said. \"But that doesn't mean they've won.\"WATCH: AI narrative is shifting towards Google with its complete stack, says Plexo Capital's Lo Toneywatch now",

    "body": "This photograph shows a general view of Nexperia headquarters in Nijmegen on November 6, 2025.John Thys | Afp | Getty Images Dutch chipmaker Nexperia has publicly called on its China unit to help restore supply chain operations, warning in an open letter that customers across industries are reporting \"imminent production outages.\"Nexperia's Dutch unit said Thursday that its open letter followed \"repeated attempts to establish direct communication through conventional channels\" but did not have \"any meaningful response.\"The letter marks the latest twist in a long-running saga that has threatened global automotive supply chains and stoked a bitter battle between Amsterdam and Beijing over technology transfer. \"We welcomed the Chinese authorities' commitment to facilitate the resumption of exports from Nexperia's Chinese facility and that of our subcontractors, enabling the continued flow of our products to global markets,\" Nexperia's Dutch unit said in the letter.\"Nevertheless, customers across industries are still reporting imminent production stoppages. This situation cannot persist,\" they added. The group called on the leadership of Nexperia's entities in China to take steps to restore the  established supply flows without delay.In a statement, Wingtech Technology, Nexperia's Chinese parent company, said on Friday that the Dutch unit's open letter contained \"a large number of misleading and untrue allegations.\"It said the \"unlawful deprivation of Wingtech's control and shareholder rights over Nexperia\" was the root cause of the ongoing supply chain chaos.\"Combined with the recent series of actions by the Dutch government and Nexperia B.V., we believe their true intention is to buy time for Nexperia B.V. to construct a 'de-China-ized' supply chain and permanently strip Wingtech of its shareholder rights,\" Wingtech said.In this photo illustration, the logo of semiconductor manufacturer Nexperia is displayed on a screen.Vcg | Visual China Group | Getty ImagesNexperia manufactures billions of so-called foundation chips — transistors, diodes and power management components — that are produced in Europe, assembled and tested in China, and then re-exported to customers in Europe and elsewhere. The chips are relatively low-tech and inexpensive but are needed in almost every device that uses electricity. In cars, those chips are used to connect the battery to motors, for lights and sensors, for braking systems, airbag controllers, entertainment systems and electric windows. How did we get here? The situation began in September, when the Dutch government invoked a Cold War-era law to effectively take control of Nexperia. The highly unusual move was reportedly made after the U.S. raised security concerns. Beijing responded by moving to block its products from leaving China, which, in turn, raised the alarm among global automakers as they faced shortages of the chipmaker's components. In an apparent reprieve last week, however, the Dutch government said it had suspended its state intervention at Nexperia following talks with Chinese authorities. It was thought at the time that this could bring an end to the dispute and pave the way for a restoration of normal supply chains.  Rico Luman, senior sector economist for transport and logistics at Dutch bank ING, said it remains unclear how long the situation will last.\"The imposed measures to seize the Dutch Nexperia subsidiary have been lifted, but there are still talks ongoing about restoring the corporate structure and relation with parent company Wingtech,\" Luman told CNBC by email.\"It's not only about supplies of finished chips, it's also about wafer supplies from Europe to the Chinese entity,\" Luman said, adding that companies including Japan's Nissan and German auto supplier Bosch are among the firms to have warned about looming shortages.Nissan signage at a dealership in Richmond, California, US, on Friday, June 21, 2024.Bloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesA spokesperson for the German Association of the Automotive Industry (VDA), which represents Volkswagen, Mercedes-Benz Group and BMW among hundreds of others, warned of elevated risks to supply, \"particularly for the first quarter\" of 2026.\"In recent weeks, the German automotive industry has largely been able to keep production stable through intensive efforts,\" a VDA spokesperson told CNBC by email. \"However, the disruptions in the supply chain for Nexperia parts caused by political intervention have not been fundamentally resolved. Component availability remains uncertain,\" they added. ING's Luman said the Nexperia situation is somewhat comparable to China's rare earth export controls.\"The Chinese position appears strong again as European manufacturers are dependent on the supplies. And comparable to the rare earths, it's not fully transparent which buyer is able to qualify for which chip supplies,\" Luman said. — CNBC's Annika Kim Constantino contributed to this report.",

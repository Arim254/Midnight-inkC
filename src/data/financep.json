    "body": "A surveillance photo released by the FBI shows a person in Washington, U.S., January 6, 2021. The FBI issued a notice, which features this surveillance photo, requesting information on person(s) responsible for pipe bombs left at the Republican National Committee (RNC) and Democratic National Committee (DNC) headquarters.FBI | ReutersThe FBI on Thursday morning arrested a suspect believed to have planted pipe bombs outside the Republican and Democratic party headquarters prior to the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riot, MS NOW reported.The suspect in custody has been identified as Brian Cole, two senior law enforcement officials told NBC News later Thursday morning.The arrest is a massive breakthrough in the nearly five-year federal investigation into who placed the bombs, which did not detonate.The suspect is charged with setting the bombs by the parties' headquarters in Washington, D.C., four people with knowledge of the development told MS NOW.A law enforcement official said that police have not yet determined a motive, MS NOW reported. But the suspect has been linked to statements that show support for an anarchist ideology, two people briefed on the arrest told the news outlet. The discoveries that led to the arrest did not come from new evidence, but rather from the same trove of material that had mostly been gathered in 2021 and 2022, two sources told MS NOW.That means the suspect could feasibly have been arrested years earlier — a fact that could cause embarrassment for the FBI, those sources said.The FBI did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment.As recently as late October, the bureau was offering a $500,000 reward for information that would help authorities identify the Capitol Hill bombing suspect.The Capitol Hill Club, home of the Republican committee headquarters, in Washington, U.S., March 9, 2021. Erin Scott | ReutersSurveillance video released by the FBI shows that around 7:54 p.m. ET on Jan. 5, 2021, a roughly five-foot-seven-inch-tall person wearing a face mask, black gloves and a gray hoodie placed a bomb outside the Democratic National Committee building.About 22 minutes later, the same person appeared to place a second bomb by the Republican National Committee's offices, according to the footage.The incident occurred hours before a mob of President Donald Trump's supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol as lawmakers prepared to confirm former President Joe Biden's 2020 election win.The timing of the attempted crime, and the elusiveness of the perpetrator, have made the case a hotbed of conspiracy theories. Last month, a conservative news site named a former U.S. Capitol Police officer as a possible match for the pipe bomber, based largely on a \"gait analysis.\" The FBI poured cold water on the story, and the accused officer cleared her name by providing a video of her playing with her puppies at the time the bombs were placed, CBS News reported.The yearslong investigation was a priority for the FBI, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives, the D.C. Metropolitan Police Department and the U.S. Capitol Police.Security fencing remains installed around the Democratic National Committee (DNC) headquarters on November 16, 2023 in Washington, DC.Kevin Dietsch | Getty ImagesBy January, the FBI said investigators and related partners had visited more than 1,200 residences and businesses, interviewed more than 1,000 people, reviewed nearly 40,000 video files and assessed more than 600 tips.As part of their search for the bomber, the FBI subpoenaed credit card data from box store retailers to identify people who bought the same type of battery components believed to be used in the devices, MS NOW reported.Agents then compared those buyers to the owners of phones tracked near the RNC and DNC buildings around the time the bombs were placed — but found no matches, according to MS NOW.They also analyzed the attempted bomber's clothing, filing subpoenas for receipts from shoe sellers — and receiving a list of almost 1,200 sales — after identifying what they believed was the suspect's sneaker, MS NOW reported.The suspect wore light gray Nike Air Max Speed Turf shoes with a yellow logo, the FBI has said.This is breaking news.

    "body": "A sign at a NYS Department Of Labor job fair at the Downtown Central Library in Buffalo, New York, US, on Wednesday, Aug. 27, 2025.Lauren Petracca | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesAnnounced job cuts from U.S. employers moved further ahead of 1 million for the year in November as corporate restructuring, artificial intelligence and tariffs have helped pare job rolls, consulting firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas reported Thursday.The firm said layoff plans totaled 71,321 in November, a step down from the massive cuts announced in October but still enough to bring the 2025 total up to 1.17 million. That total is 54% higher than the same 11-month period a year ago and the highest level since 2020, when the Covid pandemic rocked the global economy.In November, Verizon's announcement that it would slash more than 13,000 jobs helped drive the total. Tech companies, driven by innovations in artificial intelligence, listed 12,377 reductions, pushing the sector's 2025 total up 17% from a year ago. AI itself has been cited for 54,694 layoffs this year.Tariffs were cited as the driver of more than 2,000 cuts in November and nearly 8,000 year to date. The most-cited reason for the month was restructuring, followed by closings and market or economic conditions.\"Layoff plans fell last month, certainly a positive sign. That said, job cuts in November have risen above 70,000 only twice since 2008: in 2022 and in 2008,\" said Andy Challenger, workplace expert and chief revenue officer at Challenger, Gray & Christmas.Challenger also pointed out that since the financial crisis in 2008, companies have shifted away from end-year layoff announcements.\"It was the trend to announce layoff plans toward the end of the year, to align with most companies' fiscal year-ends. It became unpopular after the Great Recession especially, and best practice dictated layoff plans would occur at times other than the holidays,\" said Challenger.November offered some relief from the more than 153,000 cuts announced in October, which was the highest total for the month in 22 years.The numbers come with concerns rising over the state of the U.S. labor market.ADP reported Wednesday that private employers cut 32,000 jobs in November, the biggest decline in more than 2½ years.Hiring prospects have been dim this year as well, according to the Challenger report. Employers have announced 497,151 planned hires, off 35% from the same point in 2024.Despite signs of weakness elsewhere, Labor Department data has yet to reflect a surge in layoffs. The department on Thursday reported that weekly jobless claims unexpectedly tumbled to 191,000, the lowest in more than three years. Official data showed the decline of some 27,000 from the prior week was driven by unusually large drops in California and Texas and likely was influenced by the Thanksgiving holiday.",

    "body": "Meta has been hit with an EU antitrust investigation over its use of AI features in WhatsApp, as the European bloc continues to ramp up challenges to US big tech giants.The probe will examine whether Meta's new policy on allowing AI providers' access to WhatsApp may breach EU competition rules, Brussels said in a statement Thursday morning.A new policy announced by Meta in October prohibited AI providers from using a tool allowing businesses to contact customers via WhatsApp when AI is the main service offered, the European Commission said. While businesses may still use AI tools for functions like customer support, the bloc was concerned the new policy might \"prevent third party AI providers from offering their services through WhatsApp in the European Economic Area (EEA),\" it added.\"The claims are baseless,\" a WhatsApp spokesperson told CNBC in a statement, adding that the app's application programming interface (API) was not designed to support AI chatbots and \"puts a strain on our systems.\"\"The AI space is highly competitive and people have access to the services of their choice in any number of ways, including app stores, search engines, email services, partnership integrations and operating systems,\" the company added.It comes months on from the Commission fining Google 2.95 billion euros ($3.45 billion) for breaching antitrust rules around online advertising. In April, Apple was fined 500 million euros after being found to have breached anti-steering obligations. The same month, Meta was hit with a 200 million euros fine for breaching obligations to give consumers the choice of a service that uses less of their personal data.Fines for breaking the EU's antitrust rules can reach as much as 10% of a company's annual revenue. There are no dates set for the antitrust investigation to close, but previous cases have run on for years. \"We must ensure European citizens and businesses can benefit fully of this technological revolution and act to prevent dominant digital incumbents from abusing their power to crowd out innovative competitors,\" said the bloc's Commissioner for Competition Teresa Ribera.The investigation will cover the entire EEA apart from Italy, to avoid an overlap with its own ongoing proceedings for the possible imposition of interim measures concerning Meta's conduct.U.S. President Donald Trump has previously threatened the EU with an investigation that could lead to tariffs for imposing fines and regulation on the country's tech giants.\"As I have said before, my Administration will NOT allow these discriminatory actions to stand,\" he said following the EU's Google fine in September.

    "body": "Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff delivers the keynote address at the start of the Dreamforce conference in San Francisco on Oct. 14, 2025.Jessica Christian | San Francisco Chronicle | Getty ImagesSalesforce reported better-than-expected earnings on Wednesday and topped Wall Street estimates with its revenue guidance for the fourth quarter. The stock rose 2% in extended trading. Here's how the company did in comparison with LSEG consensus:Earnings per share: $3.25 adjusted vs. $2.86 expectedRevenue: $10.26 billion vs. $10.27 billion expectedRevenue increased 8.6% from a year earlier in the fiscal third quarter, which ended on Oct. 31, according to a statement. Net income increased to $2.09 billion, or $2.19 per share, from $1.53 billion, or $1.58 per share, in the same quarter last year, boosted by a $263 million gain from strategic investments. Adjusted earnings per share exclude stock-based compensation.The Tableau data analytics business had a higher mix of cloud services than the company had predicted during the quarter, Robin Washington, Salesforce's chief operating and financial officer, said on a conference call with analysts. Cloud revenue accrues over time, while on-premises sales for Tableau and other products like MuleSoft are recognized when the agreement is signed. For the fiscal fourth quarter, Salesforce called for $3.02 to $3.04 in adjusted earnings per share on $11.13 billion to $11.23 billion in revenue. Analysts polled by LSEG had expected $3.04 per share and $10.9 billion in revenue. The guidance implies revenue growth of between 11% and 12%, with about 3 points coming from Informatica, the data management company Salesforce acquired for around $8 billion in November. At the same time, the guidance factors in the continued shift to the cloud for MuleSoft and Tableau, as well as ongoing weakness from marketing and commerce products, Washington said.Salesforce's stock has badly underperformed the broader tech sector this year, due in part to concerns about the potential of artificial intelligence replacing some of its product capabilities. As of Wednesday's close, the shares are down 29% in 2025, while the Nasdaq has gained about 21%.During the third quarter, Salesforce acquired Regrello, whose AI software performs tasks, and Waii, which uses AI to compose code for running queries on data based on a few words of human input. The company also introduced Agentforce AI software for managing IT service requests, and issued a $60 billion fiscal 2030 revenue target, surpassing analysts' projections.Annualized revenue from Agentforce, which automates sales and customer service workflows, jumped 330% from a year earlier to over $500 million. Salesforce said it has won over 9,500 paid deals to date, up from over 6,000 as of September.Free cash flow grew 22% to $2.18 billion, but the total was below StreetAccount's $2.24 billion consensus.WATCH: Cramer's Stop Trading: Salesforcewatch now",

    "body": "Refreshed versions of the Tesla Model Y are shown outside a Tesla store in San Diego, California, U.S. October 21, 2025. Mike Blake | ReutersDETROIT — U.S. electric vehicle sales leader Tesla made notable strides in Consumer Reports' influential annual auto brand rankings, cracking the top 10 overall for the U.S.The EV manufacturer jumped from No. 18 on last year's list of more than 30 automotive brands to 10th on the 2026 Consumer Reports Brand Report Card, which was released Thursday.\"They definitely have their struggles, but by continuing to refine and not make huge changes in their models, they're able to make more reliable vehicles, and they've moved up our rankings,\" Jake Fisher, senior director of auto testing for Consumer Reports, told CNBC.The annual auto brand report card is based on Consumer Reports' testing as well as reliability, safety and overall customer satisfaction according to owner surveys.Fisher said Tesla's gain occurred as its vehicles have become more reliable over time, especially as the company hasn't made significant design changes to many of its vehicles like traditional automakers tend to do. Tesla instead relies on remote, or over-the-air, updates to revise many features on the vehicles. Its powertrain reliability remains a standout among EVs, according to Consumer Reports.The only Tesla model to have a below-average score is the Cybertruck, its newest model that features a host of new technologies such as a 48-volt architecture system and \"steer by wire.\" A Tesla Cybertruck in front of a graffiti mural on Aug. 28, 2024 in Detroit. Michael Wayland / CNBC\"They're definitely improving by keeping with things and refining, but if you look at their 5- to 10-year-old models that are out there, when it comes to reliability, they're dead last of all the brands,\" Fisher said. \"They're able to improve the reliability if they don't make major changes.\"On the other end of report card, Rivian Automotive moved up five spots to No. 26 but remains near the bottom of the rankings. Fisher said Rivian models are the lowest in reliability. Brands with good reliability tend to perform well in the overall rankings. Reliability for new 2026 models is predicted based on each model's overall reliability for the past three years, provided that the model hasn't been redesigned during that time.Subaru topped the overall 2026 brand list, followed by BMW, Porsche, Honda and Toyota to round out the top five brands. At the bottom of the rankings were Jeep, Land Rover, GMC, Dodge and Alfa Romeo.Ford Motor's Lincoln, the highest-ranked domestic brand, made the biggest jump in this year's rankings, climbing 17 positions to No. 7 due to its reliability scores. Audi dropped the most from last year, falling back 10 spots to No. 16.Consumer Reports said hybrid vehicles, which are growing in popularity, continue to stand out over other \"electrified\" vehicles, as well as traditional vehicles with internal combustion engines.Of approximately 30 hybrids analyzed by Consumer Reports, only the Hyundai Sonata Hybrid, Lincoln Nautilus Hybrid and Mazda CX-50 Hybrid have below-average predicted reliability scores.",

    "body": "BEIJING, CHINA - DECEMBER 3: French President Emmanuel Macron (R) and Chinese President Xi Jinping walk during a state visit at the Great Hall of the People on December 3, 2025 in Beijing, China. Adek Berry-Pool | Getty Images News | Getty Images China said it was open to importing more goods from France in exchange for a \"fair, conducive environment\" for Chinese businesses in the European nation, President Xi Jinping told his counterpart Emmanuel Macron on Thursday as they met in Beijing. The French president kicked off a 3-day visit to China on Wednesday — his first trip to Beijing in more than two years — on the heels of growing frictions over a range of topics including trade imbalance and the long-running war in Ukraine.  In a separate readout from the French government, Macron told Xi that the two countries must work together based on \"a balanced relationship,\" while urging Beijing to help end the Russia-Ukraine war. Macron said he welcomed Beijing's \"renewed willingness to facilitate access to the Chinese market for French products, particularly agricultural goods,\" including wine, pork, poultry and beef, according to a Google translation of the statement in French. The countries will work toward establishing a framework that allows for increased Chinese direct investment in Europe, particularly in France, where it will create more jobs, Macron said. The two leaders also signed several deals covering energy, agriculture, education and environment, according to the official readout from Chinese state media, which did not elaborate on the agreed terms. Xi also called for deepening bilateral collaboration in aerospace, nuclear energy, digital economy, biopharmaceutical and artificial intelligence sectors. The readout reflects Paris' \"ambition to be a stabilizing force in EU-China relations,\" said Daniel Balazs, a research fellow at S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies in Singapore, noting that the EU's broader aim would be to preserve constructive ties with China despite recurring frictions. \"Good ties with France also ensure that China has friends within the EU when Brussels makes economic and political decisions that impact Chinese interests,\" said Balazs.Tensions between Beijing and Paris escalated last year when Macron backed the European Union's decision to impose tariffs on Chinese-made electric vehicles, prompting Beijing to retaliate with minimum price requirements on French cognac makers. Macron is expected to lobby the Chinese leader to not impose similar measures on French pork and dairy products, Bloomberg reported Wednesday, as Beijing has weighed those duties in response to the levies on EVs. Macron had also pushed Brussels to respond with its toughest trade measures on China after Beijing restricted its rare earth exports that had triggered worries of supply shortages at European carmakers.  The bilateral meeting comes at a time when Beijing is locked in a diplomatic spat with Japan over Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi's statement that signaled a Chinese invasion of Taiwan could draw a military response from Japan. Without naming the democratically ruled island, China said Macron agreed to the \"one China policy\" — a diplomatic term commonly used to indicate Taiwan as part of China. The statement from French government did not mention Taiwan as part of the discussion. On Wednesday, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi told his French counterpart Jean-Noël Barrot that he hoped Paris to continue \"showing understanding for and supporting China's legitimate stance\" and prevent Japan from \"stirring up troubles\" over Taiwan. The Xi-Macron meeting \"provides a platform for top-level engagement [but] whether the problems can be solved is another question,\" said Tianchen Xu, senior economist at Economist Intelligence Unit. Trade, Ukraine, panda A key goal of Macron's visit was expected to be on addressing what he's called \"global imbalances\" including over-production in China and Beijing's dependence on exports which he says leads to global trade imbalance. France's trade balance with China stood at nearly 20 billion euros (about $23 billion) in 2024.  \"Macron can make his case for a partnership among equals to Xi Jinping. This includes opening China's wider market to European companies and possibly paving the way to some joint-ventures in Europe in not-so-sensitive domains,\" said Philippe Le Corre, senior fellow on foreign policy at New York-based Center for China Analysis. The two presidents exchanged views on the Ukraine war, with Xi saying that China will \"continue to play a constructive role in resolving the conflict and support European nations in pushing for a balanced, effective, and sustainable security framework.\"  Macron has long been urging Xi to use his influence on Russian President Vladimir Putin to end the war in Ukraine. \"I hope China will join our call and our efforts to achieve, as soon as possible, at the very least a cease-fire in the form of a moratorium on strikes targeting critical infrastructure,\" Macron said in a statement. This trip offers a rare chance to get Paris' views on Ukraine to a Chinese leadership which has been Russia's \"all-weather partner,\" especially since the war started in 2022, said CCA's Le Corre. After formal meetings in Beijing the two leaders will head to the southwestern city of Chengdu — home of China's giant panda breeding center. Last month, France returned a pair of loaned pandas to the Chinese city after 13 years, with their arrival being been hailed as a sign of warming diplomatic ties.    The Chinese embassy promised new pandas would soon be dispatched to France. Xi, who emphasized on expanding cultural exchange between the two countries, said that China and France had agreed to a new deal on panda protection.  — CNBC's Charlotte Reed contributed to this story.",

    "body": "U.S. Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. looks on as he attends a press conference to discuss health insurance reform, at the Department of Health and Human Services in Washington, D.C., U.S., June 23, 2025.Kevin Mohatt | ReutersHealth and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s hand-picked vaccine committee is scheduled to vote Thursday on whether to change a longstanding recommendation that every baby get vaccinated against hepatitis B within 24 hours of birth. It's unclear if the panel, called the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, or ACIP, could significantly delay or eliminate that so-called birth dose of the shot for babies whose mothers test negative for the virus. The group tabled a vote on the vaccine in September because some members called for a more robust discussion first.But any change could have wide-ranging consequences: Some public health experts say that having fewer newborns vaccinated against the virus could risk an increase in chronic infections among children. Hepatitis B, which can be passed from mother to baby during childbirth, can lead to liver disease and early death. There is no cure. \"We have a vaccine that is highly effective at preventing an incurable disease. We should take full advantage of that,\" Neil Maniar, a public health professor at Northeastern University, told CNBC. The birth dose recommendation was introduced in 1991 and is credited with driving down infections in kids by 99% since then. Maniar called that a \"remarkable success story that we run the risk of reversing\" if the committee changes the recommendation. Decisions by the panel are not legally binding, as it is up to states to mandate immunizations. But ACIP's recommendations have significant implications for whether private insurance plans and government assistance programs cover the vaccines at no cost for eligible children. The panel's upcoming two-day meeting in Atlanta comes after Kennedy earlier this year gutted the committee and appointed 12 new members, including some well-known vaccine critics. During the meeting in September, some advisors raised questions about whether the benefits of the shot outweigh potential safety risks. But the jab is \"an incredibly safe vaccine with minimal risks,\" Dr. Sean O'Leary, chair of the American Academy of Pediatrics' Committee on Infectious Diseases, said during a media briefing Tuesday. \"I never once saw a fever actually associated with hepatitis B vaccine,\" said O'Leary, who practiced for eight years as a general pediatrician and worked in a newborn nursery. The AAP, which publishes its own vaccine schedule, still recommends the universal birth dose of the hepatitis B vaccine because \"it saves lives,\" he added. A new review, published Tuesday, of more than 400 studies spanning four decades also found no evidence that delaying the universal hepatitis B vaccine birth dose improves safety or effectiveness. The review also found that the birth dose does not cause any short- or long-term serious adverse events or deaths.A 2024 CDC study showed that the current vaccination schedule has helped prevent more than 6 million hepatitis B infections and nearly 1 million hepatitis B-related hospitalizations.Merck and GSK manufacture the hepatitis B vaccines used starting at birth. Neither of the shots are significant revenue drivers for the companies. But John Grabenstein, a former Merck vaccine executive and military pharmacist, said a change to the recommendation could cause vaccine supply disruptions for the companies. \"They have build up their reserves, and they build up their thorough calculations so that they can meet the status quo,\" Grabenstein, who has no remaining financial ties to Merck, told CNBC. \"If you disrupt the status quo without warning, then there would be too much of some things and not enough of other things that could easily create spot shortages.\" Still, he said his first concern from a public health standpoint is that fewer children will get vaccinated on time, leaving them vulnerable to infection. Merck during the panel's September meeting also pushed back on changing the recommendation. \"The reconsideration of the newborn Hepatitis B vaccination on the established schedule poses a grave risk to the health of children and to the public, which could lead to a resurgence of preventable infectious diseases,\" Dr. Richard Haupt, Merck's head of global medical and scientific affairs for vaccines and infectious diseases, said at the time. ",

Mustafa Yalcin | Anadolu | Getty ImagesBeta Technologies posted its first quarterly results on Thursday since the stock debuted on the New York Stock Exchange.The electric aircraft maker, which went public last month, reported revenue of $8.9 million, more than double the $3.1 million from a year ago.\"As a newly public company, we remain firmly grounded in what makes BETA unique—our simple, stepwise approach, our vertical integration and our focus on designing and manufacturing the complete electric aviation ecosystem to meet the needs of customers around the world,\" CEO Kyle Clark said in a statement.Net loss widened to $452 million, a loss of $9.83 per share, from a loss of $82.1 million, a loss of $1.81 per share, in the year-ago period.The company said the net loss took a hit from the issuance of convertible preferred stock.Beta forecasted full-year revenue to reach between $29 million and $33 million and adjusted EBITDA to range between a loss of $295 million and a loss of $325 million.The Amazon-backed company is establishing itself as another player alongside rivals Joby Aviation and Archer Aviation in the small but competitive electric vertical take-off and landing, or eVTOL, space.Air taxi manufacturers are vying to gain approval from the Federal Aviation Administration, which launched the eVTOL Integration Pilot Program, or eIPP, in September.Read more CNBC tech newsNvidia has a cash problem -- too much of itMeta faces Europe antitrust investigation over WhatsApp AI policyNvidia CEO Jensen Huang talks chip restrictions with Trump, blasts state-by-state AI regulationsDesign executive behind 'Liquid Glass' is leaving AppleClark told CNBC that the program is a \"massive testament\" to the Trump administration's efforts in accelerating the nascent industry. Beta is applying to the program with state partners, including North Carolina, Michigan and Ohio, to host its commercial aircraft operations as soon as next June.\"We have flown more than twice as many miles than anybody else in this industry,\" Clark said. \"That real-world flying gives us the ability to go into these eIPP opportunities with a mature type of certification product with a ton of reliability.\"The company is currently working on military and cargo operations before focusing on passenger applications. During the quarter, aircraft engine supplier GE Aerospace agreed to invest $300 million in Beta and co-develop a hybrid electric turbogenerator for both defense and civil use.\"The eIPP program is meant to augment America's drone dominance and that is a military interest as well as a civil interest,\" Clark said. \"Partnership with dual-use aircraft like ours, with the military and civil applications, is a big part of this.\"The company also worked with Hartzell Propeller to land certification during the quarter, becoming the first FAA-certified propeller specifically designed for advanced air mobility aircraft. The achievement marks another step closer to obtaining Type Certification, or approval of aircraft design, for Beta's H500A electric engine.\"To take something as big and new as a primary propulsion electric motor that other people are buying, that we're using in our own aircraft — we're flying all over the world in — and be in the final steps to Type Certification is a huge validation point,\" Clark said. Beta announced earlier this week an up to supply deal with air taxi company Eve Air Mobility.Eve agreed to purchase Beta's electric pusher motors, which could potentially equate to as much as $1 billion over 10 years. Clark said during an earnings call that the deal contributed to a component backlog of over $1 billion.",

David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesPresident Donald Trump on Wednesday proposed big cuts to strict fuel economy standards for passenger cars enacted under the Biden administration. \"We are officially terminating Joe Biden's ridiculously burdensome, horrible actually, CAFE standards that imposed expensive restrictions,\" Trump said at the Oval Office, flanked by the CEOs of Ford Motor and Stellantis.The Corporate Average Fuel Economy, or CAFE, standards date back to 1975 and have been tightened over the years to make vehicles more efficient.Former President Joe Biden had required automakers to increase the fuel efficiency of passenger cars and light trucks to about 50 miles per gallon by 2031. These stricter standards were expected to stimulate the production and sale of electric vehicles in the U.S. The standards proposed by the Trump administration would require cars to get about 34 miles to the gallon by 2031, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Trump has sought to dismantle pollution regulations and federal support for electric vehicles as well as renewable energy since taking office.  The oil industry group the American Petroleum Institute has lobbied the Trump administration to repeal the Biden fuel economy standards, contending that they aim to phase out liquid fuel vehicles.The announcement was attended by Ford CEO Jim Farley and Stellantis CEO Antonio Filosa, as well as a plant manager for General Motors from Michigan.Ford CEO Jim Farley and Stellantis CEO Antonio Filosa listen as U.S. President Donald Trump announces new fuel economy standards, in the Oval Office at the White House in Washington, D.C., U.S., December 3, 2025.

    "body": "Jensen Huang, chief executive officer of Nvidia Corp., during the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC) sports day event in Hsinchu, Taiwan, on Saturday, Nov. 8, 2025. Lam Yik Fei | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesWhen Nvidia this week said it would take a $2 billion stake in chip design company Synopsys, it was just the latest in a string of massive investments announced by the chipmaker this year. Nvidia has also said it would take a $1 billion stake in Nokia, invest $5 billion in Intel and $10 billion in Anthropic — $18 billion in investment commitments from those four deals, not counting smaller venture capital investments.That doesn't even include the biggest commitment of all: $100 billion to buy OpenAI shares over a number of years, although there is still no definitive agreement, Nvidia finance chief Colette Kress said Tuesday. It's a lot of money and a lot of deals, but Nvidia's got the cash to write big checks. At the end of October, Nvidia had $60.6 billion in cash and short-term investments. That's up from $13.3 billion in January 2023, just after OpenAI released ChatGPT. That launch three years ago was key to making Nvidia's chips the most valuable tech product.As Nvidia has transformed from a maker of gaming technology into the most valuable U.S. company, its balance sheet has become a fortress, and investors are increasingly wondering what the company will do with its cash. \"No company has grown at the scale that we're talking about,\" said CEO Jensen Huang, when asked what the chipmaker plans to do with all its cash, on Nvidia's earnings call last month.Analysts polled by FactSet expect the company to generate $96.85 billion in free cash flow this year alone and $576 billion in free cash flow over the next three years. Some analysts would like to see Nvidia spend more of its cash on share repurchases. \"Nvidia is set to generate over $600B in free cash flow over the next few years and it should have a lot left over for opportunistic buybacks,\" wrote Melius Research analyst Ben Reitzes in a note on Monday.The company's board increased its share repurchase authorization in August, adding $60 billion to its total. In the first three quarters of the year, it spent $37 billion on share repurchases and dividends.\"We're going to continue to do stock buybacks,\" Huang said. Nvidia is doing the buybacks, but it's not stopping there. Huang said that Nvidia's balance sheet strength gives its customers and suppliers confidence that orders in the future, which he called offtake, will be filled. \"Our reputation and our credibility is incredible,\" Huang said. \"It takes a really strong balance sheet to do that, to support the level of growth and the rate of growth and the magnitude associated with that.\"Kress, Nvidia's CFO, on Tuesday said the company's \"largest focus\" is making sure it has enough cash to deliver its next-generation products on time. Most of Nvidia's largest suppliers are equipment manufacturers like Foxconn and Dell, which can require that Nvidia provide working capital to manage inventory and build additional manufacturing capacity. Huang called his company's strategic investments \"really important work\" and said that if companies like OpenAI grow, it drives additional consumption of AI and Nvidia's chips. Nvidia has said that it does not require any of its investments to use its products, but they all do anyway. \"All of the investments that we've done so far — all of it, period — is associated with expanding the reach of Cuda, expanding the ecosystem,\" Huang said, referring to the company's artificial intelligence software.In an October filing, Nvidia said it had has already made $8.2 billion in investments in private companies. For Nvidia, those investments have replaced acquisitions. Nvidia's $7 billion acquisition of Mellanox in 2020 is the largest the company has ever made, and it laid the groundwork for its current AI products, which aren't single chips but entire server racks that sell for around an estimated $3 million.But the company faced regulatory issues when it tried to buy chip technology firm Arm for $40 billion in 2020. Nvidia called off the deal before it could be completed after regulators in the U.S. and U.K. raised concerns about its effects on competition in the chip industry. Nvidia has purchased some smaller companies in recent years, to bolster its engineering teams, but it hasn't completed a multibillion acquisition since the Arm deal failed.\"It's hard to think about very significant, large types of M&A,\" Kress this week said, speaking at an investor conference. \"I wish one would come available, but it's not going to be very easy to do so.\"WATCH: Nvidia CEO says he supports export controls ahead of Senate Banking Committee meeting",

    "body": "A person walks by a sign for Micron Technology headquarters in San Jose, California, on June 25, 2025.Justin Sullivan | Getty ImagesMicron said on Wednesday that it plans to stop selling memory to consumers to focus on meeting demand for high-powered artificial intelligence chips. \"The AI-driven growth in the data center has led to a surge in demand for memory and storage,\" Sumit Sadana, Micron business chief, said in a statement. \"Micron has made the difficult decision to exit the Crucial consumer business in order to improve supply and support for our larger, strategic customers in faster-growing segments.\"Micron's announcement is the latest sign that the AI infrastructure boom is creating shortages for inputs like memory as a handful of companies commit to spend hundreds of billions in the next few years to build massive data centers. Memory, which is used by computers to store data for short periods of time, is facing a global shortage.Micron shares are up about 175% this year, though they slipped 3% on Wednesday to $232.25. AI chips, like the GPUs made by Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices, use large amounts of the most advanced memory. For example, the current-generation Nvidia GB200 chip has 192GB of memory per graphics processor. Google's latest AI chip, the Ironwood TPU, needs 192GB of high-bandwidth memory. Memory is also used in phones and computers, but with lower specs, and much lower quantities — many laptops only come with 16GB of memory. Micron's Crucial brand sold memory on sticks that tinkerers could use to build their own PCs or upgrade their laptops. Crucial also sold solid-state hard drives. Micron competes against SK Hynix and Samsung in the market for high-bandwidth memory, but it's the only U.S.-based memory supplier. Analysts have said that SK Hynix is Nvidia's primary memory supplier. Micron supplies AMD, which says its AI chips use more memory than others, providing them a performance advantage for running AI. AMD's current AI chip, the MI350, comes with 288GB of high-bandwidth memory.  Micron's Crucial business was not broken out in company earnings. However, its cloud memory business unit showed 213% year-over-year growth in the most recent quarter. Analysts at Goldman on Tuesday raised their price target on Micron's stock to $205 from $180, though they maintained their hold recommendation. The analysts wrote in a note to clients that due to \"continued pricing momentum\" in memory, they \"expect healthy upside to Street estimates\" when Micron reports quarterly results in two weeks.A Micron spokesperson declined to comment on whether the move would result in layoffs.\"Micron intends to reduce impact on team members due to this business decision through redeployment opportunities into existing open positions within the company,\" the company said in its release.WATCH: Winners and losers from surge in prices for memory chipswatch now",

    "body": "watch nowNvidia CEO Jensen Huang said he met with President Donald Trump on Wednesday and that the two men  discussed chip export restrictions, as lawmakers consider a proposal to limit exports of advanced artificial intelligence chips to nations like China. \"I've said it repeatedly that we support export controls, and that we should ensure that American companies have the best and the most and first,\" Huang told reporters on Capitol Hill. Lawmakers were considering including the Guaranteeing Access and Innovation for National Artificial Intelligence Act in a major defense package, known as the National Defense Authorization Act. The GAIN AI Act would require chipmakers like Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices to give U.S. companies first pick on their AI chips before selling them in countries like China. The proposal isn't expected to be part of the NDAA, Bloomberg reported, citing a person familiar with the matter. Huang said it was \"wise\" that the proposal is being left out of the annual defense policy bill. \"The GAIN AI Act is even more detrimental to the United States than the AI Diffusion Act,\" Huang said.  Nvidia's CEO also criticized the idea of establishing a patchwork of state laws regulating AI. The notion of state-by-state regulation has generated pushback from tech companies and spurred the creation of a super PAC called \"Leading the Future,\" which is backed by the AI industry. \"State-by-state AI regulation would drag this industry into a halt and it would create a national security concern, as we need to make sure that the United States advances AI technology as quickly as possible,\" Huang said. \"A federal AI regulation is the wisest.\"Trump last month urged legislators to include a provision in the NDAA that would preempt state AI laws in favor of \"one federal standard.\"But House Majority Leader Steve Scalise (R-LA) told CNBC's Emily Wilkins on Tuesday the provision won't make it into the bill, citing a lack of sufficient support. He and other lawmakers will continue to look for ways to establish a national standard on AI, Scalise added. WATCH: Nvidia currying favor to be able to sell chips in Chinawatch now",

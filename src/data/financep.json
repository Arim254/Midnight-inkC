    "body": "After graduating from Boston College with a doctorate degree in law in 2001, landing a job at the Department of Labor and later financial services firm Fidelity, Sonia Raman thought she would be a lawyer forever.Then in 2008, she left her career in corporate law behind to coach women's basketball.\"I actually really loved my day job at Fidelity, but I think [my] passion was with coaching,\" Raman, 51, tells CNBC Make It. \"Basketball just kept pulling me back in.\"It was a \"calculated risk,\" she says, but one that seems to have paid off: Raman was named the next head coach of the WNBA's Seattle Storm on Oct. 28. She is the first Indian American to hold a head coaching position in the league.Raman, who walked onto the Division III basketball team at Tufts University as an undergraduate, says she first developed an interest in coaching her junior year of college while sidelined due to a major injury.Her \"love of the game started to really evolve into the lens of a coach,\" when she began spending her free time reviewing videos of the team's upcoming opponents — taking notes to share with her team for a competitive edge, she says.Coaching was always supposed to be a part-time passionSince graduating from college in 1996, Raman says, she has always coached basketball in some capacity, whether it be leading a youth team in her years before law school or a summer league team during law school.As a lawyer on Fidelity's risk and compliance team, she spent her workdays advising non-profits on their sponsored retirement plans, and evenings as an assistant coach for the women's team at Wellesley College.\"I was fully stimulated from morning till night doing these different roles,\" she says.For six years, she says she would rush from work to Wellesley, grabbing the bag she had packed in her car to change quickly into athletic clothes, just to make the team's scheduled practice.Her head coach at Wellesley kept encouraging her to pursue coaching full time, but balancing the assistant position with her job at Fidelity was a sustainable lifestyle and one she enjoyed, she says.Taking a pay cut to bet on herselfThen the perfect opportunity at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology presented itself: The school was looking for a women's basketball head coach who could also lead the athletic department's compliance team.While the pay cut bumped her out of the tax bracket she was in at Fidelity, it \"ended up being not as bad as it seemed,\" and the tradeoff was well worth it, she says.\"I felt like I was betting on myself, investing in my own growth and my own passion for what I really wanted to do,\" she says. \"I also just felt like I was impacting people's lives in a way that was much more fulfilling to me than anything I had done before.\"After 12 seasons at MIT, the two-time New England Women's and Men's Athletic Conference women's basketball coach of the year, left to become an assistant coach in the NBA for the Memphis Grizzlies in 2020. Last season, she was an assistant coach in the WBNA for the New York Liberty.'If I'm going to preach a growth mindset … then I need to live that'Raman, who has always been big on planning and preparation, says leaving her law career behind was the biggest decision \"not fully in the box and on a path\" she has ever made. While she did have doubts, she says she also knew she was capable of making a career out of basketball, and worst case, she would always have a law degree to fall back on.Intentionally pushing herself out of her comfort zone, an important trait she often encourages her players to embrace, forced her to shift her personal mindset on uncertainty as well, she says.\"If I'm going to preach a growth mindset, if I'm going to preach getting better every day and embracing failure, then I need to live that,\" Raman says.CNBC is now accepting nominations for the 2026 Changemakers List!

    "body": "Volunteers load boxes of food into cars during an event held by the Community FoodBank of New Jersey in partnership with Bergen County to deliver emergency food relief to Federal workers and SNAP recipients amid the U.S. government shutdown in Leonia, New Jersey, U.S., November 6, 2025.Mike Segar | ReutersWorries over the government shutdown surged in the early part of November, pushing consumer sentiment to its lowest in more than three years and just off its worst level ever, according to a University of Michigan survey released Friday.The university's monthly Index of Consumer Sentiment posted a reading of 50.3 for the month, indicating a decline of 6.2% on the month and about 30% from a year ago. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones had been looking for 53.0 after October's 53.6. Sentiment was last this low in June 2022 as inflation hovered around its highest level in 40 years. November's reading was the second lowest going back to at least 1978.Concerns about the ongoing impasse in Washington topped consumers' fears, outweighing a boost in sentiment from new record highs in stock prices, said survey Director Joanne Hsu.\"With the federal government shutdown dragging on for over a month, consumers are now expressing worries about potential negative consequences for the economy,\" Hsu said. \"This month's decline in sentiment was widespread throughout the population, seen across age, income, and political affiliation.\"Other measures in the survey painted a similar picture.The current conditions index slid to 52.3, a drop of nearly 11% from last month, while the future expectations measure fell to 49.0, down 2.6%. On a year-ago basis, the two measures respectively slumped 18.2% and 36.3%.\"Across the economy, segments of the population are increasingly dealing with tighter financial conditions,\" said Elizabeth Renter, senior economist at consumer finance site NerdWallet. \"That's certainly true for federal workers and people dependent on food assistance from the federal government. But it's also likely increasingly true for middle income Americans.\"Measures of inflation held relatively in check, with a drop in the longer-term outlook. The outlook for one year from now nudged higher to 4.7%, while the five-year measure was at 3.6%, down 0.3 percentage point.With government economic data collection and releases suspended during the shutdown, measures like the Michigan sentiment survey loom larger as alternative measures of economic progress.As has been the case with other measures, the survey found some disparity in income levels and particularly by asset holdings. Hsu said sentiment among those with the largest stock holdings actually improved 11%.",

    "body": "A Peloton stationary bicycle inside a store in Palo Alto, California, US, on Monday, Aug. 5, 2024. David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesPeloton on Thursday posted its second profitable quarter in a row as it released strong guidance for the crucial holiday shopping season, banking on its relaunched product assortment to drive growth. The connected fitness company posted a surprise net income of $13.9 million in the three months ended Sept. 30, compared with a loss of $900,000 a year earlier. For the current quarter, Peloton's strongest for hardware sales, the company is expecting revenue to be between $665 million and $685 million, a slight increase from the year-ago period and largely better than Wall Street expectations of $665 million, according to LSEG. Peloton also raised its full-year adjusted EBITDA outlook and is now expecting it to be between $425 million and $475 million, up $25 million from its previous outlook on both ends. Much of that forecast is ahead of analyst expectations of between $400 million and $450 million, according to StreetAccount. Shares jumped about 11% in extended trading Thursday.Despite the good news, Peloton is still dealing with issues from its past. Earlier on Thursday, it said it was initiating yet another recall from its early product lineup. The Consumer Product Safety Commission said the company was recalling 833,000 of its original Bike+ devices after receiving reports that the seat post can break and detach during a ride – the same issue that prompted a recall of its base Bike model in 2023. \"We have received a small number of reports of an original series Bike+ seat post breaking during use. As of today, we are aware of three such incidents,\" Peloton CEO Peter Stern said on the company's earnings call Thursday.Peloton's latest recall cost the company $13.5 million during the quarter reported Thursday, contributing to a 0.3 percentage point decline in its gross margin.For its first fiscal 2026 quarter reported Thursday, Peloton beat analyst expectations on the top and bottom lines. Here's how the fitness company did in its first fiscal quarter compared with what Wall Street was anticipating, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:Earnings per share: 3 cents vs. 0 cents expectedRevenue: $551 million vs. $540 million expectedSales dropped to $551 million, down about 6% from $586 million a year earlier. Under the direction of Stern, who took the helm in January, the connected fitness company has been finalizing its cost cuts and turning its attention back to growth now that it's back to regularly generating free cash flow and operating profitably. \"Our intent is to go well beyond [cardio connected fitness]... we've got strength, we've got mental, mental wellbeing, nutrition and hydration and sleep and recovery,\" Stern said. \"We are focused on growth, but the growth needs to be profitable … both in top line growth as well as increased margins associated with that business as well.\"Last month, Peloton relaunched its product assortment, introduced a commercial equipment line and raised prices for both subscriptions and hardware ahead of the holiday shopping season. The revamped assortment, touching its bike, rowing machine and treadmill products, features an AI-powered tracking camera, speakers, a 360-degree swivel screen and hands-free control, among other new features. \"Our launch of an entirely new product lineup with the cross training series, is a great reason for us to talk to our members and nonmembers alike,\" Stern said.Peloton is betting consumers will be willing to spend big on the products for flashy holiday gifts, either for themselves or a loved one. But just over a month into the launch, it remains unclear how they're performing. The company's first fiscal quarter ended the day before the new products were launched. Across the retail industry, the personal electronics category has been under pressure. While Peloton operates in a category of its own, shoppers have been pulling back on other big-ticket items and being more careful about where their dollars are going in an unsteady economic environment. After Peloton's last recall, the company said at the time that it saw higher-than-expected membership churn and costs as a result.– CNBC's Luke Fountain contributed to this report",

    "body": "The Ford Lightning is seen at the New York International Auto Show on April 16, 2025.Danielle DeVries | CNBCDETROIT — Ford Motor is reportedly considering ending production of its all-electric F-150 Lightning pickup truck amid mounting losses and more challenging market conditions for EVs.The Wall Street Journal first reported the talks Thursday, adding they are ongoing and nothing has been finalized. A source familiar with Ford's product strategy who spoke anonymously because the talks were private confirmed to CNBC that the automaker has been evaluating its future EVs amid the company's losses and changing market conditions.\"What I can say is that F-150 Lightning is the best-selling electric pickup truck in the U.S. — despite new competition from CyberTruck, Chevy, GMC, Hummer and Rivian — and delivered record sales in Q3. Right now, we're focused on producing F-150 ICE and Hybrid as we recover from the fire at Novelis,\" a Ford spokesman said in an emailed statement Thursday, declining to comment on the discussions.Ford previously confirmed it paused production of the Lightning amid supply chain disruptions related to a fire at an aluminum plant for Novelis, a main supplier for the pickup truck.Ford President Kumar Galhotra, when asked last month by media about Lightning production potentially ending, said the company's main priority was gas-powered models. He said F-150 Lightning production could restart whenever the company would like but declined to give a timeframe.The F-150 Lightning, which Ford once said was as important to the company as founder Henry Ford's Model T, never lived up to internal or external expectations. The pickup initially received more than 200,000 nonbinding reservations that failed to convert to sales.F-150 Lightning sales this year through October are roughly level compared with a year earlier at only 24,577 units. Since going on sale in 2022 in the U.S., Ford has sold less than 100,000 F-150 Lightning models.The Lightning is manufactured at a facility connected to a large F-150 production plant in metro Detroit.Ford's EV operations, including the Lightning, have lost the company billions of dollars annually in recent years.The U.S. EV market has faced daunting changes in regulations under the Trump administration this year, including the end of consumer credits of up to $7,500 for the purchase of an EV.The reported discussions at Ford follow crosstown rival Stellantis deciding to end plans to produce an all-electric Ram 1500 pickup as well as General Motors significantly scaling back its plans for electric trucks.",

    "body": "US President Donald Trump speaks with the press as he meets with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington, DC, on Feb. 13, 2025. Jim Watson | AFP | Getty ImagesIn a sign of easing pressure on India, U.S. President Donald Trump said that trade talks with New Delhi were going well, and he could visit the country next year.Trump who was speaking to reporters at the White House on Thursday said India \"has largely stopped buying oil from Russia,\" and if Prime Minister Narendra Modi extended him an invite, he would visit the country in 2026.Evoking memories of his last visit to India, Trump called Modi \"his friend\" and a \"great man.\"In the last few months, India and U.S. relations have been under stress, with experts warning of missing chemistry between the two leaders, leading to a disconnect between India-US ties.Steep tariffs, $100,000 fee for H1B visas, and Trump's repeated claims of having brokered a ceasefire between India and Pakistan and India's purchases of Russian crude are among issues that have led to a deterioration of ties between New Delhi and Washington in recent months, according to experts.India currently faces 50% tariffs on it exports, higher than the 47% duties on China.\"Negotiations between New Delhi and Washington D.C. are ongoing and both sides appear optimistic about trade deal being reached by the end of the year, possibly even in the next few weeks,\" said Alexandra Hermann, head of Southeast Asia Research of Oxford Economics.The tariff rate on Indian goods could be cut to 20% from 50% currently, putting India in comparable level to its Asian peers such as Vietnam, Thailand, or the Philippines, she said.Hermann added that the baseline tariff on India \"may not fall to Japan and South Korea's level of 15%\" due to sticking points around purchases of Russian oil, agricultural imports, and limited scope to commit to sizable investments in the U.S.Last month, the U.S. imposed sanctioned on Russian oil majors Rosneft and Lukoil, which will come into force from Nov 21. As a result Indian and Chinese refiners have started to cut down imports of Russian oil.According to a Reuters report on Thursday, Russian oil is trading at its steepest discounts to Brent in a year in Asia, as major Indian and Chinese refiners reduce purchases.India's Petroleum and Natural Gas ministry did not immediately respond to CNBC's query on the country cutting Russian oil imports.\"Over the long term, completely phasing out Russian oil isn't realistic for India,\" said Prateek Pandey head of APAC oil and gas research at Rystad Energy, adding that as Russian crude becomes available at a sharper discount \"New Delhi's approach of \"economics first\" will be tested more than ever.",

Santiago | Getty ImagesThe Trump administration asked a federal appeals court to issue an emergency block on a judge's order that it pay 42 million Americans their full SNAP benefits for November by Friday.The administration requested that the 1st Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals allow it to pay 65% of the food stamp benefits this month from a contingency fund, as the administration had proposed to the judge earlier this week.The request came a day after Judge Jack McConnell issued an order in U.S. District Court in Rhode Island rejecting the partial payment option.McConnell ordered the administration to use so-called Section 32 funds to help fully fund the SNAP benefits, along with the $4.65 billion it already planned to use from the contingency fund appropriated by Congress. The administration earlier had rejected the idea of using Section 32 funds for that purpose.The appeals court on Friday morning told plaintiffs in the case to respond to the administration's motion for an emergency stay of McConnell's order by noon, ET.The administration last week said it planned to completely cease payments to recipients of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program in November because there was no current funding appropriated by Congress for it.Read more CNBC government shutdown coverage Government shutdown could cost U.S. economy up to $14 billion, CBO saysJudge extends ban on Trump firing federal workers during government shutdownStates sue Trump admin to keep SNAP benefits during government shutdownLargest federal worker union urges end to government shutdownTrump's $130 million mystery military donor is Timothy Mellon: NYTGovernment shutdown becomes second-longest in U.S. historyStates sue Trump administration to keep SNAP benefits Government shutdown becomes 2nd longest in U.S. historyHow to get student loan help during the government shutdownWhite House economic advisor Hassett says shutdown could end this weekArmy Corps of Engineers pausing $11 billion in projects over shutdown: VoughtGovernment shutdown: Trump distrust keeps Democrats from forming 'gang'Bill to fund military during government shutdown fails in Senate procedural voteThe U.S. government has been shut down since Oct. 1 because Congress has been unable to agree on a bill that would temporarily fund federal programs, including SNAP.Prior administrations have continued paying SNAP benefits during other shutdowns.A group of cities, charitable and faith-based non-profit groups, unions, and business organizations sued the Trump administration, asking McConnell to order officials to fully SNAP benefits.On Oct. 31, McConnell ordered the administration to pay at least partial benefits from the contingency fund as soon as possible, and to investigate whether other funds could be used to help pay for the full benefits. The administration on Monday told McConnell it would pay 50% of SNAP benefits for November by using the contingency money, but said it would not use other funds. On Wednesday, the administration told the judge that a review of the contingency funds available meant that 65% of the benefits could be paid.Plaintiffs in the case said that was not acceptable and asked McConnell to order that full benefits be paid.McConnell agreed, telling administration lawyers at a hearing on Thursday, \"People have gone without for too long.\"\"The evidence shows that people will go hungry, food pantries will be overburdened, and needless suffering will occur\" if SNAP is not fully funded, the judge said.\"While the President of the United States professes a commitment to helping those it serves, the government's actions tell a different story,\" McConnell wrote in a subsequent written order.This is breaking news.

    "body": "The logo of SoftBank is displayed at a company shop in Tokyo, Japan January 28, 2025. Issei Kato | ReutersShares of Japan's SoftBank Group resumed their slide on Friday, following a broader slump in AI-related stocks as investors once again grew wary of the sector's lofty valuations.The group, which holds a wide range of AI investments across infrastructure, semiconductor, and application companies, saw shares close 6.87% lower, recouping some losses from earlier in the session.This comes after SoftBank gained nearly 3% in the previous session, having plunged 10% on Wednesday to clock its worst day since April. It saw almost $50 billion in market cap wiped out this week and its worst weekly loss since March 2020, down nearly 20%.\"SoftBank Group's shares are falling as many bought it as the only listed proxy for OpenAI,\" said David Gibson, senior research analyst at financial services firm MST Financial.The pullback reflects growing caution around the AI sector and a realization that many of OpenAI's partnerships are still potential rather than confirmed, with funding prospects uncertain, he told CNBC.OpenAI CEO Sam Altman reportedly said the company has spoken with the U.S. government about potential federal loan guarantees to encourage chip factory construction. His comments came after OpenAI's CFO suggested the firm hoped for federal help in securing chip financing.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconShares of SoftBank Group fall following renewed pressure on AI-linked stocksSoftBank holds a controlling stake in U.K.-based semiconductor designer Arm Holdings, whose chips help power mobile and AI processors globally. Shares of Nasdaq-listed Arm slid 1.21% overnight.Separately, Bloomberg recently reported citing people familiar with the matter that the group considered acquiring U.S. chipmaker Marvell Technology Inc. earlier this year.Broader declineOther Japanese tech stocks also declined. Semiconductor testing equipment maker Advantest dropped 5.5%, chipmaker Renesas Electronics fell nearly 4%, Tokyo Electron, a chip production equipment maker, declined 1.35%.Shares of the world's largest chipmaker, TSMC, fell 0.34%.Nvidia-supplier SK Hynix was down 2.2% and South Korean peer and memory chipmaker Samsung fell 1.3%.The declines in Asian tech stocks also come after AI-related companies in the U.S. fell overnightQualcomm dropped almost 4%, despite strong quarterly results, after warning it could lose future Apple business. AMD, a strong performer Wednesday, slipped 7%, while Palantir and Oracle were down about 7% and 3%, respectively. Nvidia and Meta Platforms also finished lower.The excitement surrounding AI has raised worries that markets might be experiencing a tech bubble. Some experts argue that the valuations of AI companies are starting to resemble the dot-com bubble of the late 1990s, with stock prices rising well beyond realistic profit forecasts.The economic impact of artificial intelligence is undeniable and market bumps are inevitable, said Laura Cooper, global investment strategist at Nuveen.\"Still, it's too soon to call a bubble. Today's AI capex is being funded largely by cash-rich firms with solid balance sheets, not cheap credit or speculation,\" she said. \"The greater risk isn't a bubble bursting, but valuation fatigue — investors tiring of paying ever-richer premiums for AI returns that don't materialize quickly enough.\"",

    "body": "watch nowPentagon-backed MP Materials warned investors this week to approach other rare earths projects with caution, pointing to the industry's difficult economics.Stocks of U.S. rare earth companies have had wild swings in recent months as investors have speculated that the Trump administration might strike more deals along the lines of its landmark agreement with MP. Smaller retail traders have gotten involved in the stocks with the VanEck Rare Earth and Strategic Metals ETF up 60% this year.The Defense Department in July took an equity stake in MP, set a price floor for the company, and inked an offtake agreement with the rare earth miner and magnet maker in an effort to roll back China's dominance of the industry.CEO James Litinsky said he didn't want \"people to get burned\" amid the speculation. Litinsky cautioned investors \"to just be very clear-eyed about what the actual structural economics are amidst all the excitement.\"\"The vast majority of projects being promoted today simply will not work at virtually any price,\" Litinksy said on the company's third-quarter earnings call Thursday evening.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconVanEck Rare Earth and Strategic Metals ETF, YTDMP views itself as \"America's national champion,\" Litinsky said. MP is the only active rare earth miner in the U.S. and has offtake agreements with Apple and General Motors in addition to the Pentagon.\"We have structural advantage because we're fully vertically integrated,\" the CEO said. \"We're years and billions ahead of others.\"It takes years for the best rare earth producers to ramp up and stabilize their output and economics \"despite what some promoters might suggest,\" Litinksy said. Australia's Lynas took about a decade and MP will reach normalized production in about three years from the start of commissioning, he said.watch nowThe White House is \"not ruling out other deals with equity stakes or price floors as we did with MP Materials, but that doesn't mean every initiative we take would be in the shape of the MP deal,\" a Trump administration official told CNBC in September.Litinsky described the rare earth industry as close to a \"structural oligopoly,\" a system where there are just a few major players. The government investing in a dozens of sites and businesses wouldn't necessarily set up a supply chain, he said.The Trump administration should continue to encourage private capital to flow into the industry through loans, grants and other support, Litinsky said. There is room for \"a lot of other players and supply\" but the market will require \"materially higher prices\" for the industry's structural challenges to change, he said.\"If X dollars of capital can stimulate two or three X in private capital, they should be doing that as much as possible,\" Litinsky said.The CEO indicated that he views MP as a forerunner that will help create the conditions for a broader market that is not dependent on China over time.\"In the very short term the administration has made sure that we have a successful national champion in MP,\" Litinsky said. \"We are going to sort of pave the path if you will to then figure out how there's much broader supply coming online.\"Rare earths are crucial for making magnets that are key inputs in U.S. weapons platforms, semiconductor manufacturing, electric vehicles, clean energy technology and consumer electronics. Beijing dominates the global supply chain and the U.S. is dependent on China for imports.",

US President Donald Trump said he would be imposing tariffs on semiconductor imports \"very shortly\" but spare goods from companies like Apple Inc. that have pledged to boost their US investments. Photographer: Will Oliver/EPA/Bloomberg via Getty ImagesWill Oliver | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesMeta projected that 10% of its overall sales in 2024, or about $16 billion, came from running online ads for scams and banned goods, according to a Thursday report from Reuters. Those kinds of ads included promotions for \"fraudulent e-commerce and investment schemes, illegal online casinos and the sale of banned medical products,\" according to the Reuters report, which was based on internal company documents. Those documents showed the company's attempts to measure the prevalence of fraudulent advertising on its apps like Facebook and Instagram. Meta brought in more than $164.5 billion in overall sales for 2024. Last week, the company said that third-quarter sales rose 26% year-over-year to $51.24 billion and that it lifted the low end of its total expenses for the year by $2 billion as part of its massive investments into artificial intelligence.The Reuters report cited a December 2024 document that showed how Meta each year generates roughly $7 billion in annualized sales from so-called \"higher risk\" scam ads, which are promotions that are clearly deceptive. Each day, Meta shows users an estimated 15 billion of these higher risk scam ads, the Reuters report said, citing a separate document.Although some of the documents show that Meta aims to reduce the amount of bogus ads on its platform, the Reuters report also said that other documents suggest the company is concerned that its business projections could be impacted by any abrupt removal of the fraudulent promotions.A Meta spokesperson said that the company \"aggressively\" addresses scam and fraud ads on its apps. The projections that 10% of the company's 2024 ad sales came from bunk ads \"was a rough and overly-inclusive estimate rather than a definitive or final figure; in fact, subsequent review revealed that many of these ads weren't violating at all,\" the spokesperson said in a statement.\"Unfortunately, the leaked documents present a selective view that distorts Meta's approach to fraud and scams by focusing on our efforts to assess the scale of the challenge, not the full range of actions we have taken to address the problem,\" the spokesperson said.WATCH: Wall Street backs AI winners, and Meta's not one of them this quarter.watch now",

    "body": "The National Thanksgiving turkeys, Blossom and Peach, wait before being pardoned by U.S. President Joe Biden during a ceremony on the South Lawn of the White House on November 25, 2024 in Washington, DC. Andrew Harnik | Getty ImagesThe price of turkeys is soaring this Thanksgiving, and experts say consumers will have to hunt around to find a bargain for those birds.Driving the price hikes is a stressed turkey supply chain.The U.S. turkey flock has dropped to its lowest size in nearly 40 years because of the highly pathogenic avian influenza, according to the American Farm Bureau Federation.As a result, wholesale turkey prices have surged 75% since October 2024, according to an analysis by the Purdue University College of Agriculture.Wholesale turkey prices averaged 94 cents per pound at that point last year, compared with $1.71 per pound last month, according to U.S. Department of Agriculture data.Purdue University's model predicts that the average retail price of a turkey will be approximately $2.05 per pound in November, which is 25% higher than a year ago, costing consumers about $31 for a 15-pound bird.Purdue analysts emphasized that the actual retail price range of turkeys is wide because of differences in quality — organic or pasture-raised turkeys cost more.The timing of the turkey orders by retailers also is critical in determining price.\"Retailers that didn't secure their turkey orders early may face steep spot market prices, which could impact availability and cost,\" wrote Dr. Michael Swanson, chief agricultural economist for the Wells Fargo Agri-Food Institute.\"In contrast, those who waited may now be facing steep spot market prices,\" Swanson said.Spencer Platt | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesConsumers could end up paying $20 more for a 16-pound turkey if they buy it from a retailer who purchased it on the spot market, compared with what it would cost at a retailer who purchased the turkey earlier on the wholesale market.\"This year, where you shop could make a big difference, and savvy consumers may find significant savings by comparing options,\" Swanson said.Major retailers who placed early orders appear to be leveraging their turkeys as a draw to bring shoppers into stores, according to Swanson.Walmart is offering a dinner bundle, which includes a 16-pound turkey and sides, for under $56 for 10 people.A Thanksgiving bundle from Aldi's sells for $40 and feeds 10 people. Amazon is offering its own Thanksgiving dinner promotion for $25. Target on Wednesday announced a $20 Thanksgiving deal for four.Other grocers, such as ShopRite and Foodtown, are offering customers a free 10-to-20-pound store-brand turkey if they spend $400 by Thanksgiving. BJ's is running a similar promotion for $150.Wells Fargo's annual Thanksgiving food report shows that the typical cost of a turkey dinner for consumers is higher than those deals. A holiday menu that uses all store-brand items costs $80, while a menu with all national name brands totals $95, Wells Fargo's report said.\"Our report shows consumers spending more this Thanksgiving than on the retail promotions because we lean into a mix of prepared items and items that need assembly, which cost more versus making items from scratch,\" Swanson said.\"That mix in our view, more accurately portrays what we expect consumers to use for the meal this year.\"  In addition to the timing of purchases, the strength of supply-chain relationships between grocers and the farmers they work with has enabled some retailers to keep turkey prices from soaring.Customers push shopping carts outside a Stew Leonard's supermarket in Paramus, New Jersey, U.S., on Tuesday, May 12, 2020. Stew Leonard Jr. said that meat packing plant the company uses is operating at about 70 percent capacity, and he expects it to rebound to full capacity in about a month, CT Post reported.Angus Mordant | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesStew Leonard's — which operates a small chain of grocery stores in Connecticut, New York and New Jersey — said it was able to keep its turkey prices the same as last year because of its longstanding relationship with its bird supplier.\"We have been working with the same farm for decades, and the farm hasn't been impacted by bird flu,\" said Stew Leonard Jr., the chain's CEO.Thanksgiving dinner traditionally is considered one of the most affordable holiday meals, because red meat is not typically served.But given the increase in turkey prices, Leonard said, ham is a good alternative option for a Thanksgiving main course.Consumers could also opt to go to a butcher or store that will sell dark turkey meat or parts, which would cost less than a whole bird, he said.The reduction in flock size has led to layoffs for poultry producers.Perdue Farms in September announced it was laying off nearly 300 employees at an Indiana turkey plant, reportedly because of bird flu and a consumer shift toward other meats.One farmer who supplies Perdue said he lost 48,000 turkeys after a flu test came back positive.The USDA is forecasting an increase in turkey production in 2026, assuming the avian flu abates.But because of the current size of the flock, prices are not expected to drop considerably in 2026.The top eight states for turkey production are Minnesota, North Carolina, Arkansas, Indiana, Missouri, Virginia, Iowa and Pennsylvania. Turkey farms in North Dakota and South Dakota were hit with an outbreak of the flu in September.No new data on turkeys and agriculture is expected to be released by the USDA due to the government shutdown, which on Wednesday became the longest shutdown in U.S. history.",

    "body": "watch nowJobs Friday won't be happening again this week as the record-long government shutdown has resulted in a lack of official data on the labor market as well as a host of other important indicators.In the absence of critical data points, alternative data is the only game in town when it comes to measuring current conditions. In a nutshell, various metrics show the U.S. labor market appears to be plodding along, with a sharp slowdown in hiring and scattered signs of an increase in layoffs.Had the Bureau of Labor Statistics released its monthly nonfarm payrolls report for October, economists surveyed by Dow Jones expect it would have shown a decline of 60,000 jobs and an unemployment rate increase to 4.5%.Other data points collected over the past several weeks paint a broad mosaic of a weak, though not collapsing, labor market that policymakers are viewing with a wary eye.\"We're in an unusual environment, which is this low-hiring, low-firing, environment,\" Austan Goolsbee, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, told CNBC in a Thursday interview. \"That characterizes periods of high uncertainty, when businesses have pulled back.\"Though the timing was a coincidence, the Chicago Fed in October unveiled its own menu of data indicators. An update Thursday showed little change in the unemployment rate, edging toward 4.4%, still a low number by historical standards, as well as layoffs and the hiring rate.Elsewhere, though, there are signs of potential trouble, though not of a systemically weak labor market.A look at alt dataHere's a quick glimpse at a handful of other metrics various data collectors have released recently:Payrolls processing firm ADP reported earlier this week that companies added just 42,000 jobs in October, a number that was better than expected but still demonstrated anemic hiring.Outplacement and consulting firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas reported 153,074 announced job cuts in October, the highest level for the month in 22 years.The Institute for Supply Manufacturing released its purchasing managers indexes for the manufacturing and services sectors this week, both indicating that more companies plan on holding staffing levels or cutting rather than adding workers. The employment index for ISM services was 48.2% while manufacturing came in at 46%. Though both were slightly higher on the month, any reading below 50% indicates contraction.Bank of America also has begun collecting its own employment data. The bank reported year-over-year payroll growth of 0.5% in October, unchanged from September. BofA data also showed a significant disparity in wage growth, with higher earners seeing year-over-year gains of 3.7%, middle earners at 2% but lower income rising only 1%. Overall, Bank of America said its data showed \"no significant slowdown\" for the labor market.Job search site Indeed's closely watched measure of job openings saw another drop as October ended, with its index slipping further last week to its lowest level since February 2021.Workplace management site Homebase indicated a further decline in small business employment, with its \"employees working\" indicator down 2.9% from its January level and hours worked off 2.9%.Small businesses hitThe Homebase data points to another trend, in which larger firms are continuing to add workers but smaller businesses have largely bowed out.\"The story now for 12 months has been one of small business conservatism, and I don't think that's changed in aggregate,\" Homebase CEO John Waldmann said in an interview. \"Businesses are choosing to have fewer people and have them work more hours. That generally is a conservative stance in how to operate a small business.\"The ADP numbers have showed a steady erosion in employment for smaller firms. Businesses employing fewer than 250 people lost 34,000 workers in October. On the year, businesses with fewer than 50 people have added 133,000 workers, but most of that came in earlier months.However, while there's only scant signs of growth, there are also few indicators of the aggressive layoffs that would signal a broader economic downturn.Though the Labor Department isn't aggregating weekly jobless claims data during the shutdown, state-level filings show a fairly steady pattern.A \"We Are Hiring\" sign at the Appalachian State University internship and job fair in Boone, North Carolina, US, on Wednesday, Oct. 1, 2025. Allison Joyce | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesGoldman Sachs estimates that claims would have totaled 228,000 last week, an increase of 9,000 but largely in line with recent trends.\"We're showing a cooling labor market ... but certainly not a collapsing labor market,\" added David Tinsley, senior economist at the Bank of America Institute. \"Some of this cool down we've seen in jobs growth is being borne particularly by small businesses.\"For policymakers like Goolsbee, the Chicago Fed president, the data also is suggestive of a fairly stable jobs picture.Alternative data is giving Fed officials at least a general look at the labor market while the government data blackout continues. However, there's not as much alt information on inflation, which is giving Goolsbee pause as he considers whether another interest rate cut would be appropriate or even necessary barring evidence of a deeper labor downturn.\"There's been a lot of stability in the job market. The unemployment rate is objectively low and the layoff rate is objectively low,\" he said. \"That'd be very unusual for the beginning of a recession.\"watch now",

Angela Weiss | AFP | Getty ImagesThis week's equity market wobble, which saw a retreat in U.S. artificial intelligence-related stocks amid ongoing concerns over stretched valuations, has thrust contagion fears into the spotlight for global investors.Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon warned this week of a \"likely\" 10-20% drawdown in equity markets at some point within the next two years, while the International Monetary Fund and the Bank of England have both sounded the alarm bells.Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey highlighted the possibilities of an AI bubble in an interview with CNBC on Thursday, noting that the \"very positive productivity contribution\" from technology companies could be offset by uncertainty around future earning streams in the sector.\"We have to be very alert to these risks,\" Bailey said.Legrand is one of several European companies which is benefitting from the AI boom. The French company, which sells products to Alphabet, Amazon and others to help cool servers, has seen its shares surge 37% this year, roughly as much as Nvidia.watch nowAnders Danielsson, CEO of Swedish construction group Skanska, which builds data centers and other AI infrastructure assets, shrugged off concerns about a slowdown.\"In the U.S. we have a very strong pipeline of data centers — we don't see any slowdown there,\" he told CNBC. \"We are working with large international customers and they are also interested in building data centers in central Europe, and in the Nordics and the U.K. We haven't seen any slowdown really.\"Meanwhile Kiran Ganesh, multi-asset strategist at UBS, highlighted a notable lack of volatility, adding that the broader narrative remains positive.\"We've had a remarkably smooth rally given the scale of investment that's taken place, given the uncertainty about future cash flows, and given some of those concerns about valuation,\" Ganesh told CNBC's \"Europe Early Edition\" on Friday.\"As we've gone through earnings season, I think it's reasonable to have expected some volatility, but actually when we look at the results, and they have been reassuring, we're still up over the course of earnings season and they have been beating expectations. So although some volatility has been materializing this week, we think that's to be expected and the bigger picture still remains positive.\"Read moreStill, many investors appear to be souring on the increasingly-stretched valuations.In Asia, shares of SoftBank Group — which is active across AI infrastructure, semiconductor and application companies — have fallen sharply, with the Japanese group suffering almost $50 billion in weekly losses. SoftBank resumed its downward trajectory on Friday, after dropping about 10% on Wednesday.On Tuesday, it emerged that Scion Asset Management, the hedge fund led by \"The Big Short\" investor Michael Burry, had built short positions against both Palantir Technologies and Nvidia, drawing the ire of Palantir CEO Alex Karp.\"Some big tech stocks are on sale, and are presenting buying opportunities for investors, especially for investors who have missed out on the market's strength over the past two months,\" said Glen Smith, chief investment officer at GDS Wealth Management.Other investors have flagged concentration risk in U.S. equities, and advocate looking further afield.Luca Paolini, chief strategist at Pictet Asset Management, said stretched valuations mean the firm is neutral on U.S. names. \"Emerging markets are preferred, with diversified exposure across India, Brazil, and broader EM benefiting from AI-driven investment and monetary easing,\" Paolini said in a market commentary.",

    "body": "Tesla CEO Elon Musk attends the Saudi-U.S. Investment Forum, in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, May 13, 2025. Hamad I Mohammed | ReutersTesla CEO Elon Musk says the company will likely need to build a \"gigantic\" semiconductor fabrication plant to keep up with its artificial intelligence and robotics ambitions.\"One of the things I'm trying to figure out is — how do we make enough chips?\" Musk said at Tesla's annual shareholders meeting Thursday.Tesla currently relies on contract chipmakers Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company and Samsung Electronics to produce its chip designs. Musk said he was also considering working with U.S. chip company Intel. \"But even when we extrapolate the best-case scenario for chip production from our suppliers, it's still not enough,\" he said.Tesla would probably need to build a \"gigantic\"  chip fab, which Musk described as a \"Tesla terra fab.\" \"I can't see any other way to get to the volume of chips that we're looking for.\" Microchips are the brains that power almost all modern technologies, including everything from consumer electronics like smartphones to massive data centers, and demand for them has been surging amid the AI boom.Tech giants, including Tesla, have been clamoring for more supply from chipmakers like TSMC — the world's largest and most advanced chipmaker. According to Musk, Tesla's potential fab's initial capacity would reach 100,000 wafer starts per month and eventually scale up to 1 million. In the semiconductor industry, wafer starts per month is a measure of how many new chips a fab produces each month.For comparison, TSMC says its annual wafer production capacity reached 17 million in 2024, or around 1.42 million wafer starts per month.While Tesla doesn't yet manufacture its own microchips, the company has been designing custom chips for autonomous driving for several years.It is currently outsourcing production of its latest-generation \"AI5\" chip, which Musk said will be cheaper, power-efficient, and optimized for Tesla's AI software.The CEO also announced on Thursday that Tesla will begin producing its Cybercab — an autonomous electric vehicle with no pedals or steering wheel — in April.Musk's statements underscore Tesla's shift into AI and robotics — industries the CEO sees as the future of the global economy. \"With AI and robotics, you can actually increase the global economy by a factor of 10, or maybe 100. There's not, like, an obvious limit,\" Musk said at the shareholder meeting. ",

Brian Snyder | ReutersVenture capitalist David Sacks, who is serving as President Donald Trump's artificial intelligence and crypto czar, said Thursday that there will be \"no federal bailout for AI.\"\"The U.S. has at least 5 major frontier model companies. If one fails, others will take its place,\" Sacks wrote in a post on X.Sacks' comments came after OpenAI CFO Sarah Friar said Wednesday that the startup wants to establish an ecosystem of private equity, banks and a federal \"backstop\" or \"guarantee\" that could help the company finance its infrastructure investments.She softened her stance later in a LinkedIn post and said OpenAI is not seeking a government backstop for its infrastructure commitments. She said her use of the word \"backstop\" clouded her point.\"As the full clip of my answer shows, I was making the point that American strength in technology will come from building real industrial capacity which requires the private sector and government playing their part,\" Friar wrote.The White House did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment. OpenAI directed CNBC to Friar's LinkedIn post.Sacks said the Trump administration does want to make permitting and power generation easier, and that the goal is to facilitate rapid infrastructure buildouts without raising residential electricity rates.\"To give benefit of the doubt, I don't think anyone was actually asking for a bailout.

It plans to more than double that store count to more than 500 locations by 2035, the filing said.Bob's is known for selling lower-priced couches, rugs, dining room tables and other furniture. It has an average order value of about $1,400 per transaction, excluding sales at its outlets, according to its S-1 filing. The retailer estimates its prices are on average about 10% lower than its value-focused furniture competitors' lowest promoted prices or about 20% to 25% below their listed prices.To keep prices low, the company said it relies on a \"curated merchandising strategy, longstanding sourcing relationships and efficient supply chain,\" according to the filing. It carries roughly one-third fewer items than value-oriented competitors, but orders in larger quantities, the filing said.It's also tried to stand apart from other furniture retailers with quicker deliveries. Instead of customers waiting for weeks or months, most purchases can be delivered in as few as three days, the company said in the filing. The stock will trade on the NYSE under the ticker symbol BOBS.",

    "body": "Gabby Jones | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesKalshi on Thursday announced new initiatives to expand its surveillance and enforcement frameworks as skepticism builds around the booming predictions market space. The announcement comes days before Super Bowl 60, which has already drawn more than $160 million in prediction market trading volume, according to Kalshi. The platform and its peers allow users to buy event contracts for outcomes in politics, pop culture, financial markets and sports. Prediction trades on predetermined outcomes — like, for example, on which companies will air Super Bowl ads on Sunday — have prompted questions of possible insider trading. New York Attorney General Letitia James on Monday issued a warning about what she called \"unregulated prediction markets.\" \"Being federally regulated means that Kalshi bans market manipulation, insider trading, has limits on the types of markets it lists, runs Know-Your-Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) checks on every user before they can trade, and publicly reports all trades to the CFTC daily,\" the company said in a release. \"Kalshi also spent years building custom prediction market trade surveillance and enforcement systems that are similar to those used in the stock market.Kalshi said Thursday it has taken further steps, forming an independent surveillance advisory committee, which will provide quarterly analysis to the company's outside counsel and publish statistics on investigations into suspicious activity on its platform. The company also announced surveillance partnerships with Solidus Labs and the Director of the Wharton Forensic Analytics Lab.The prediction market will also now work with the former Under Secretary of the Treasury for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence to advise Kalshi on \"market integrity, trading surveillance and financial compliance matters.\" Kalshi lawyer Robert DeNault has also been appointed to the role of Head of Enforcement, where the company said he will work with the advisory committee to identify insider trading and market manipulation.Lastly, Kalshi said it has created hubs on its website to provide resources for consumers on responsible trading and market integrity.In a post on X, CEO Tarek Mansour said if the company finds any wrongdoing, the penalties include fines and referrals to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission — which regulates event contracts in the U.S. — and the Department of Justice for prosecution. \"In the past year, we ran over 200 investigations and froze relevant accounts,\" Mansour wrote. \"Of these, over a dozen have become active cases and several have been referred to law enforcement.\"Mansour added that Kalshi has based its market surveillance system on those used by the New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq, flagging suspicious behavior by running trades through pattern recognition models. \"All industries have bad actors and no system is perfect, Kalshi's included,\" Mansour wrote. \"But we are committed to improving daily. Lots of work ahead!\"Disclosure: CNBC has a commercial relationship with Kalshi.",

    "body": "Silver bars are stacked in the safe deposit boxes room of the Pro Aurum gold house in Munich, Germany, Jan. 10, 2025.Angelika Warmuth | ReutersSilver prices slid as much as 16% on Thursday, snapping a two-day rebound, as the white metal continues to reel from excessive volatility.Spot silver prices were trading almost 12% lower at 8:32 a.m. ET, at around $77.42 per ounce, while futures in New York were around 9% lower at $76 per ounce. Meanwhile, spot gold declined around 2% to $4,860 per ounce, while futures were down 1.5% at $4,881.Silver had been on a record-breaking spree before crashing almost 30% last Friday. In 2025, it gained about 146%, data from LSEG showed.Analysts point to speculative flows, leveraged positioning and options-driven trading, rather than physical demand, as key drivers of the recent price swings.\"You'd seen a lot of speculator positions build up ... I don't think it's been fully flushed out,\" said Sunil Garg, managing director of Lighthouse Canton.While Garg says the fundamental case for silver demand still holds, he advises to wait a bit more for the speculative positions to get \"wiped out\" first. Silver has a wide range of industrial and technological uses, extending from solar power, catalysts and electronics, amongst others.\"The margin requirements being raised by various metals exchanges around the world ... that's just something that's going to kill off some of the speculation,\" said Garg. The CME Group has raised margin requirements following the steep sell-off last Friday.\"As prices fell, dealer hedging flipped from buying into strength to selling into weakness, investor stop-outs were triggered, and losses cascaded through the system,\" Goldman Sachs said in a note on Wednesday. Stock Chart IconStock chart iconSilver prices in the past one yearSilver's correction has been larger than gold's due to tighter liquidity conditions in the London market, which magnified price swings.Goldman added that the timing of the volatility suggested Western flows, rather than Chinese speculation, are behind much of the build-up and unwind, noting that most of the more violent moves occurred while Chinese futures markets were closed.The volatility in silver prices has drawn growing comparisons to meme stocks such as GameStop, the video-game retailer that became a global phenomenon in 2021 after retail traders on Reddit piled in en masse, sending its shares soaring far beyond what traditional valuation models could justify.Market watchers had warned that prices were detached from sustainable levels, turning the silver trade increasingly meme-like.The precious metals theme captured the public attention and led to \"momentum trading that exceeded even the type of outsized moves that we have seen in a wide range of speculative assets,\" said Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers.",

    "body": "A projection of a Euro currency sign is pictured on the facade of the European Central Bank (ECB) headquarters in Frankfurt am Main, western Germany, on Dec. 30, 2025.Kirill Kudryavtsev | Afp | Getty ImagesThe European Central Bank on Thursday kept policy rates unchanged for the fifth consecutive meeting, with its key interest rate at 2%, in line with the bank's target.The ECB commented Thursday that the inflation trajectory and wider economic conditions did not warrant a move at this month's meeting, but warned that the outlook was unpredictable.\"Inflation should stabilise at its 2% target in the medium term. The economy remains resilient in a challenging global environment. Low unemployment, solid private sector balance sheets, the gradual rollout of public spending on defence and infrastructure and the supportive effects of the past interest rate cuts are underpinning growth,\" the central bank said. \"At the same time, the outlook is still uncertain, owing particularly to ongoing global trade policy uncertainty and geopolitical tensions,\" it added. The euro was flat against the dollar, at $1.179, following the decision, which had been widely anticipated.ECB President Christine Lagarde said at a news conference Thursday that the central bank would maintain its data-dependent and \"meeting-by-meeting approach,\" and would not be \"precommitting to a particular rate path.\" \"In particular, our interest rate decisions will be based on our assessment of the inflation outlook and the risks surrounding it,\" she said.Not a 'non-event'At first glance, Thursday's decision looks like a non-event. Economists say it's not. \"It would be wrong to characterize the February meeting as a non-event. The environment is marked by high uncertainty and two-sided risks,\" Deutsche Bank economists said in emailed research ahead of the rate hold.\"Understanding how the ECB is thinking about risks is important to gauging the path of policy going forward,\" they added, assessing what the rising euro exchange rate means for monetary policy when the euro zone's inflation rate is already below the ECB's 2% target, with flash data on Wednesday showing the rate had cooled to 1.7% in January. \"All else unchanged, the recent appreciation [of the euro] is disinflationary and reinforces the expected inflation undershoot. However, the scale of the impact depends on the circumstances.\"Currency appreciation tends to cause disinflation by making imported goods, raw materials and energy cheaper, in turn lowering production costs and consumer prices. While that may be good for businesses and consumers in the short term, central banks are wary about disinflation, and potentially deflation, over the longer term because it can trigger economic stagnation with consumers holding off purchases (in the expectation that prices will fall further) while businesses can see lower revenues and increased real debt burdens.Over the past month, the euro has strengthened 0.75% against the dollar, and is up almost 14% over the last 12 months, amid rising concerns over the unpredictability of U.S. economic policy. Some ECB policymakers have expressed concern over the single currency's appreciation against the greenback and its possible depressant effect on the bank's inflation target of 2%.\"We are closely monitoring this appreciation of the euro and its possible implications for lower inflation,\" France's central bank governor, Francois Villeroy de Galhau, commented last week.Lagarde said Thursday that the ECB's Governing Council had discussed downside inflation risks and the euro's exchange rate as part of its latest economic risk assessment.\"Inflation could turn out to be lower if tariffs reduce demand for euro area exports by more than expected, and if countries with overcapacity increase further the exports to the euro area,\" she noted, adding:\"Moreover, a stronger euro could bring inflation down beyond current expectations. More volatile and risk-averse financial markets could weigh on demand, and thereby also lower inflation.\"Stock Chart IconStock chart iconEUR/USD exchange rate over the last 12 monthsDespite the red flags, Greg Fuzesi, euro area economist at JPMorgan, said it's not clear that currency moves to date will be seen as very concerning. \"The ECB looks at both the level of the currency, the speed of its movement and whether any changes are likely to persist, and none of this looks overly troubling or clear in the context of an economy that has recently been resilient to a variety of pressures,\" he said in emailed comments. \"Of course, all of this can change if growth indicators weaken and/or if the currency strengthens much more from here. But neither is the case right now,\" he noted.Hike next?The ECB's latest decision was in line with consensus forecasts. Around 85% of economists surveyed by Reuters in their January poll said the ECB would leave rates unchanged over the rest of 2026.Sylvain Broyer, chief EMEA economist at S&P Global Ratings, commented Thursday that the central bank could \"keep the autopilot on this time.\" \"FX [foreign exchange] markets remain volatile and distorted by uncertainty, yet they're doing their job as shock absorbers. Financing conditions stay supportive, and growth continues to outperform expectations,\" he said in emailed comments.The ECB can afford to wait until next month's updated economic projections to reassess whether its monetary policy is still in a good place, Broyer added.Deutsche Bank's base-case scenario is for the ECB to hold rates at 2% through 2026, with the next move a hike in mid-2027. This, they noted in emailed analysis, would be \"driven by fiscal easing, a tight labor market and future inflation risks moving above target.\"This year, meanwhile, sees the risks skewed toward further easing. \"Ultimately, we think domestic inflation will outweigh external disinflation – we see evidence of the fiscal easing starting to spur activity, but at the same time the external risks have increased. Domestic conditions versus external conditions is the key data battle to watch,\" they said. ",

Jassy served as Amazon founder Jeff Bezos' shadow in the early 2000s, before he went on to be CEO of Amazon Web Services. Jay Marine, a top executive in Amazon's Prime Video streaming unit, was Bezos' shadow in 2013. Agarwal served as Bezos' shadow from 2007 to 2009 before he helped oversee Amazon's international expansion and India business. Mehta replaces Alex Dunlap, a former AWS VP who was appointed Jassy's technical advisor in late 2024, Business Insider reported.

    "body": "A Peloton Bike inside a showroom in New York, US, on Wednesday, Nov. 1, 2023. Peloton Interactive Inc. is scheduled to release earnings figures on November 2.Michael Nagle | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesPeloton posted a worse-than-expected holiday quarter on Thursday after shoppers failed to shell out for its new AI-driven product line and turned away from higher subscription prices, sending shares down more than 20% in early trading. The connected fitness company missed Wall Street's estimates on the top and bottom lines and fell short of its own internal sales targets in the three months ended Dec. 31 – typically the strongest for Peloton's hardware revenue. The company said it expects sluggish sales to continue in the current quarter. Peloton forecasts revenue between $605 million and $625 million, below expectations of $638 million, according to LSEG. The weak results, coupled with soft guidance, are the first clues investors have that Peloton's product overhaul may not be the sales driver the company hoped it would be. The revamped assortment, which came with artificial intelligence-powered tracking cameras, speakers, 360-degree swivel screens and hands-free control, was designed to grow sales and bring in new customers. But Peloton's results show demand has been sluggish. While Peloton's top line might be disappointing to investors, the company is still making gains in improving its profitability. Over the holiday quarter, the company generated $81 million in adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, better than the $73 million analysts had expected, according to StreetAccount. After it announced plans to lay off 11% of its staff last week, the company expects to generate between $120 million and $135 million in adjusted EBITDA in the current quarter, better than the $119 million analysts had expected, according to StreetAccount.It raised its full-year adjusted EBITDA guidance to between $450 million and $500 million, up from a prior range of between $425 million and $475 million. That's welcome news to investors because it shows Peloton was able to innovate its product line without draining profitability. Also on Thursday, the company announced CFO Liz Coddington is leaving Peloton to \"pursue an opportunity outside the industry.\" She's staying on through March as the company searches for its next finance chief.Here's how Peloton did in its fiscal second quarter compared with what Wall Street was anticipating, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:Loss per share: 9 cents vs. 6 cents expectedRevenue: $657 million vs. $674 million expectedThe company's net loss for the quarter was $38.8 million, or 9 cents per share, a significant improvement from the $92 million, or 24 cents per share, it lost in the year ago period. Sales fell to $656.5 million, down about 3% from $673.9 million a year earlier.Since Peter Stern took over as Peloton's CEO, he's worked to generate new revenue streams and build on the company's progress of improving its profitability. The revamped product assortment was one of his first big moments as CEO and included new prices for both subscriptions and hardware. Despite higher prices, revenue for both hardware and subscription came in lower than expected, indicating unit sales have been weak. Hardware sales drove $244 million in revenue during the quarter while subscriptions saw $413 million in sales, both below expectations of $253 million and $424 million, respectively, according to StreetAccount. In a statement, Stern focused on the company's profitability improvements and said he's seeing \"positive momentum\" across the business. \"Our second quarter represented the most substantial period of innovation at Peloton since our founding. At the same time, our financial performance demonstrated our continued operational discipline, resulting in 39% year-over-year growth in Adjusted EBITDA and reducing Net Debt by 52% year-over-year, proving we can simultaneously innovate and increase our profitability,\" said Stern. \"Our subscription base is highly committed, our integrated Commercial Business Unit is growing and well-positioned to continue doing so, and Member engagement with Peloton IQ is encouraging.\"",

    "body": "Cheng Xin | Getty ImagesBitcoin sank below $67,000 on Thursday as investor confidence continued to falter in the asset once hailed as \"digital gold\" and a unique store of value.Digital assets, including bitcoin, have fallen deeper into the red as investors re-assess the practical utility of a token that has been championed not only as a hedge against inflation and macroeconomic uncertainties but also as an alternative to fiat currencies and traditional safe-havens such as gold.That hasn't panned out lately, since bitcoin peaked just north of $126,000 in early October.On Thursday, bitcoin was last down to $67,675, its lowest since since November 2024. The cryptocurrency broke below $70,000 earlier in the session Thursday and then the selling increased. The cryptocurrency is down 20% this week alone.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconBitcoin, 1 day\"This steady selling in our view signals that traditional investors are losing interest, and overall pessimism about crypto is growing,\" Deutsche Bank analyst Marion Laboure  said Wednesday in a note to clients.Growing investor caution comes as many of the sensationalized claims about bitcoin have failed to materialize. The token has largely traded in the same direction as other risk-on assets, such as stocks,  particularly during recent geopolitical and macroeconomic flare ups in Venezuela, the Middle East and Europe, and its adoption as a form of payment for goods and services has been minimal.Bitcoin underperforming gold Bitcoin is down nearly 30% over the past year, while gold has surged 68% in the same period. Other cryptocurrencies are cratering too. Ether has pulled back 23% this week, on track for its worst week since November 2022, when it slumped 24%. Solana hit $88.42 on Thursday, about a two-year low and off 24% on the week.Some traders have suggested $70,000 is a key level to watch and a break below that could trigger further declines for bitcoin. James Butterfill, head of research at Coinshares, said $70,000 is shaping up as a \"key psychological level,\" adding that \"if we fail to hold it, a move toward\" the $60,000 to $65,000 range \"becomes quite likely.\"Stock Chart IconStock chart iconThe price of bitcoin over the last year. The latest move in bitcoin comes amid a worsening sell-off in U.S. tech stocks. The State Street Technology Select Sector SPDR ETF dropped 2.8% Wednesday, one day after losing 2.2%. Meanwhile, precious metals continue to be volatile too, with silver plunging again on Thursday and gold under pressure. Forced liquidations — when traders' positions are automatically sold as bitcoin hits a set price — continue to weigh on markets. As of Thursday, more than $2 billion in long and short positions in cryptocurrencies have been liquidated this week, according to data from Coinglass.Bitcoin has been on a steady decline for more than three months, and is now more than 45% below its October high. Other cryptocurrencies, including ether and XRP, have fallen even more. \"[The] straight line bull run that a lot of people expected hasn't really materialized yet. Bitcoin isn't trading on hype anymore, the story has lost a bit of that plot, it is trading on pure liquidity and capital flows,\" Maja Vujinovic, CEO of digital assets at FG Nexus, told CNBC's \"Worldwide Exchange.\"watch nowInstitutional demand reversesWhile many in the crypto market have previously credited large institutional investors with supporting the price of bitcoin, now it is those same participants who appear to be selling.\"Institutional demand has reversed materially,\" CryptoQuant said in a report on Wednesday. U.S. exchange-traded funds, which purchased 46,000 bitcoin this time last year, are net sellers in 2026, CryptoQuant said.The report notes other worrying signs. \"Bitcoin has broken below its 365-day moving average for the first time since March 2022 and has declined 23% in the 83 days since the breakdown — worse than the early 2022 bear phase,\" CryptoQuant analysts said. A moving average tracks the price of an asset over a set number of periods, smoothing out short-term price fluctuations to identify trends.The latest leg lower in bitcoin suggests \"potential downside toward the $70K–$60K range,\" CryptoQuant said.",

    "body": "Various cans of alcoholic ready-to-drink beverages including Captain Morgan Rum and Coke, Bacardi MoJito, Archers and Lemonade, Malibu and Pineapple, Pina Colada Cocktail and Gordon's Gin and Tonic are displayed for sale in a supermarket  on January 10, 2024.John Keeble | Getty ImagesThe U.S. alcohol industry had another sobering year in 2025.Spirits supplier revenue fell 2.2% to $36.4 billion for the year, according to new data by industry trade group the Distilled Spirits Council of the United States (DISCUS). The decline came as economic pressure and weaker consumer confidence weighed on discretionary spending.\"While total U.S. spirits sales edged down 2.2% in 2025, the spirits industry remains resilient,\" said Chris Swonger, DISCUS CEO and president, in a statement.Overall volumes for the year rose 1.9% to 318.1 million 9-liter cases, indicating growing demand. But the revenue decline suggests that while Americans are still drinking, they are also trading down — opting for lower-priced spirits and pulling back on premium purchases.Nearly every major spirits category posted revenue declines. Vodka sales fell 3% to $7 billion. Sales of tequila and mezcal — the industry's fastest growing segment for several years now — slipped 4.1% to $6.4 billion. American whiskey and cordials revenue dipped 0.9% and 3.2%, respectively.The exception was in convenience and value.Last call for optimismSales of premixed cocktails, including spirits-based ready-to-drink beverages, surged over 16% compared to the year prior, reaching $3.8 billion. The category, known as RTD, has more than doubled its market share since 2021 as consumers gravitate toward a lower price point.Within tequila, the shift has also been toward more affordable bottles, as macro headwinds make consumers rethink splurges on premium brands. Volume in the lowest tequila/mezcal price point the trade group tracks grew 6.5% in 2025, along with a 2.8% climb in the next tier higher. Volume for whiskey, vodka, rum and gin all fell at those price points.As consumers move toward more affordable spirits, companies like Diageo and Brown-Forman may be best positioned, as they have the most exposure to lower-priced tequila and the fast-growing RTD category. Diageo owns Casamigos tequila and has built out a sizable portfolio of spirit-based RTDs, while Brown-Forman controls key mixed price tequila brands like El Jimador. On the other hand, beer-heavy players like AB InBev and Molson Coors have minimal tequila exposure, although they have been expanding their RTD portfolios. Modelo and Corona owner Constellation Brands in a unique position with both beer and tequila exposure, but a smaller RTD footprint. Overall, the beverage alcohol market has softened after years of pandemic-fueled growth, and DISCUS' new data reinforces that normalization is now turning into contraction.\"The companies that have started to report are posting weak numbers but no worse than expected,\" said Trevor Stirling, Bernstein European and American beverages analyst. \"The rate of decline is not getting worse, might be slowing and one can dream of a return to volume growth.\"Lingering trade tensionsDistillers have also been navigating headwinds abroad. American spirits exports fell 9% year over year in the second quarter of 2025, amid lingering trade tensions and the removal of U.S. products from many Canadian retail shelves following President Donald Trump's tariff hikes on the U.S. neighbor last year.Industry leaders say tariff uncertainty is making it difficult to plan long-term. \"The unpredictability surrounding global trade issues continues to weigh heavily on the U.S. spirits sector,\" said Swonger. \"Reinstating zero-for-zero tariffs on distilled spirits must be a priority to get our American distillers back on a path to growth and prosperity.\"Despite the revenue pullback, spirits actually maintained its market share lead of the total beverage alcohol market at 42.4%, compared to beer and wine at 41.8% and 15.7%, respectively. Still, the message from 2025 is clear: Consumers are drinking less, but those who are still drinking are being more selective. In a tougher economic environment, cheaper tequila and canned cocktails are winning out over premium bottles behind the bar. ",

    "body": "Evan Spiegel, CEO of Snap Inc. attends the annual Allen and Co. Sun Valley Media and Technology Conference at the Sun Valley Resort in Sun Valley, Idaho, July 9, 2025.David A. Grogan | CNBCSnap shares were up over 2% in after-hours trading on Wednesday after the Snapchat parent released fourth-quarter earnings that beat on sales. The company also announced a $500 million stock repurchase program.Here is how the company did compared with Wall Street's expectations:Earnings per share: 3 cents. That figure is not comparable to analysts' estimates.Revenue: $1.72 billion vs. $1.70 billion expected, according to LSEG Global daily active users: 474 million vs. 478 million expected, according to StreetAccountGlobal average revenue per user (ARPU): $3.62 vs. $3.56 expected, according to StreetAccountThe social media company said first-quarter revenue will be in the range of $1.50 billion to $1.53 billion, which is below analyst estimates of $1.55 billion. Sales in Snap's fourth quarter rose 10% year over year, while net income was $45.2 million, which was up nearly 400% from the $9.1 million it reported a year ago.Snap said that fourth-quarter adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA, was $358 million, topping the $300 million that StreetAccount was projecting.The company also said that its adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter will be between $170 million and $190 million. That midpoint is higher than StreetAccount's estimates of $178 million.Snap's fourth-quarter global DAU dropped by 3 million quarter-over-quarter, which the company attributed to a reduction in marketing spending \"in order to focus on more profitable growth,\" according to a letter to investors.Additionally, Snap said that due to Australia's social media minimum age act, the company \"implemented platform-level age verification\" in that country during the fourth quarter that resulted \"in the removal of approximately 400,000 accounts.\"The company said that DAU for the North American region was 94 million, lower than the 97 million that Wall Street was projecting.Snap shares dipped slightly in after-hours trading when an analyst asked the company's executives during an earnings call about potential regulatory challenges. \"Obviously, there's quite a bit working its way to the court system right now that would further restrict the use of Snapchat for our community,\" Snap CEO Evan Spiegel said during the earnings call about the regulatory environment. Still, he said, the company's global ad sales stemming from users under the age of 18 is \"not material.\"\"Looking at the revenue-generating potential of the business looking forward, we're not overly concerned about the changing regulatory environment,\" Spiegel said.Snap CEO Evan Spiegel will be interviewed by CNBC's Julia Boorstin on Thursday at 11 AM ET.In the letter, Snap said it plans to focus on growing its subscription-related offerings, like Snapchat+ and the recently debuted Memories Storage Plans. The company said overall subscribers to those services grew 71% year over year to 24 million in the fourth quarter.\"Certainly memory storage plans were a big driver of the subscriber growth that we've seen recently,\" Spiegel said.Last week, Snap announced that it had created a wholly owned subsidiary named Specs Inc. that will develop and market the company's augmented reality glasses. \"We're super excited about what's ahead this year with the launch of Specs, and obviously graduating from the R&D phase of Specs to broader consumer adoption,\" Spiegel said about the company's upcoming AR glasses slated to debut in 2026.Because the company's AR glasses \"appeals to a different audience segment than the core Snapchat audience,\" Spiegel said, it's \"going to be really important for us to develop a standalone brand identity for Specs.\"Spiegel said that while \"there may be opportunities to raise additional capital\" for the company's AR glasses-related efforts in the future, Snap will need to be \"balancing\" the outside investment with its \"own ownership interest and any potential dilution.\"WATCH: Snap CEO Evan Spiegel on AR glasses.watch now",

    "body": "People walk along Bank Junction next to the Bank of England in the City of London, the capital's financial district.Vuk Valcic | SOPA Images | Lightrocket | Getty ImagesThe Bank of England kept interest rates on hold at 3.75% at its first meeting of 2026 on Thursday.The central bank's nine-member Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) voted by a narrow 5-4 margin to keep rates on hold. Four members voted to reduce the benchmark interest rate, known as \"Bank Rate,\" by 25 basis points. Economists polled by Reuters had expected the vote to be a clearer cut 7-2 split.The BOE's policymakers last voted narrowly to cut interest rates in December, but economists had expected the central bank to hold rates steady in February, given better-than-expected monthly growth figures and persistent inflation (at 3.4% in December), in the latest data.The BOE said that monetary policy is being set to ensure that the inflation rate \"not only reaches 2% but remains sustainably at that level in the medium term, which involves balancing the risks around achieving this.\" \"On the basis of the current evidence, Bank Rate is likely to be reduced further,\" but it said judgments around further policy easing will become a closer call. \"The extent and timing of further easing in monetary policy will depend on the evolution of the outlook for inflation,\" the statement said, although it added that it expected the inflation rate to \"fall back to around the 2% target from April.\"Pound sterling was trading 0.6% lower against the dollar, at $1.356, following the data.What's next?Now, all eyes are on forthcoming inflation data, and the timing and pace of expected rate cuts this year. The BOE's Governor Andrew Bailey was among the MPC members who voted to keep rates on hold. \"I expect to see quite a sharp drop in inflation over coming months,\" he said in a statement.\"Overall, the risks from inflation persistence appear to have continued to reduce. I therefore see scope for some further easing of policy. This does not mean that I expect to cut Bank Rate at any particular meeting. I will go into the coming meetings asking whether a cut is justified,\" he said. Here's what economists expect from the central bank:\"There's no doubt that inflation will come down from here and particularly in the crucial April print,\" Simon French, chief economist and head of Research at Panmure Liberum, told CNBC Thursday.The narrower-than-expected MPC vote split crystallized the idea that the central bank will cut rates in spring, French said.\"The timing of that, whether it's the April 30th meeting or into June. I'm not quite sure but that was certainly a more dovish stance in terms of the vote setup than the market was expecting,\" he told CNBC's \"Decision Time.\"The BOE's last rate cut in December came against a backdrop of lackluster growth, softening labor market data and a decline in inflation but the rate of consumer price rises have since ticked higher, giving the bank pause for thought, other economists noted.\"The early data covering 2026 hint at stronger demand and stickier inflation than we had expected. In time, fiscal tightening and decelerating pay growth will snuff out excess price pressures, but not as soon as we anticipated before,\" Andrew Wishart, senior U.K. economist at Berenberg, said in emailed comments.Berenberg has pushed back the three 25 basis-point reductions it expects the BOE to make to its key rate in 2026 to begin in the second quarter; \"We now expect the next move at the 30 April meeting,\" Wishart noted.watch nowEdward Allenby, senior U.K. economist at Oxford Economics, agreed that while the MPC remained divided for now, more rate cuts are coming.\"The current bout of mild stagflation is likely to keep the committee divided on the timing of these future cuts, encouraging a gradual approach to loosening policy further,\" he noted in emailed analysis.\"We see the end-April meeting as the most likely timing for the next cut,\" Allenby said. \"By then, the MPC should have a clearer view of the pay awards and whether this is further evidence of slack emerging in the economy,\" he said. Rob Wood, chief U.K. economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, commented Thursday: \"We stick to our call for an April cut for now.\"Meanwhile, Suren Thiru, ICAEW economics director, noted Thursday that \"rate-setters look likely to opt for two interest rate cuts this year, possibly in April and July, while keeping a third reduction in their back pocket to deploy if the economy fares worse than the Bank forecasts.\"Dani Stoilova, U.K. and Europe economist at BNP Paribas Markets 360, believes the first rate cut of 2026 could come earlier than April, but could be a standalone trim.\"We continue to expect the next rate cut in March. After that, we think the BOE will deliver a prolonged pause before resuming policy normalisation in early 2027 (we see a terminal rate of 3.00% by mid-2027),\" she said in emailed comments.",

Hims & Hers had previously been offering compounded semaglutide, the active ingredient in Novo's blockbuster drugs Ozempic and Wegovy, in an injectable format, and is now extending the offering to include the oral version. Even though semaglutide's patent is protected in the U.S. until 2032, Hims says that itscopies are \"personalized,\" and therefore legal.\"This compounded product uses a different formulation and delivery system than FDA-approved oral semaglutide,\" the company said in the announcement.\"This once-a-day pill has the same active ingredient as Wegovy and empowers providers to tailor treatment plans specifically for those who prefer to avoid needles or need smaller doses to help to balance side-effects.\"Lilly doesn't yet have an oral option on the market but is expected to launch a rival pill in the first half of this year, pending Food and Drug Administration approval.CNBC couldn't immediately reach Novo Nordisk for a comment.

    "body": "Pandora, the world's largest jeweler by volume, rose Thursday after the company addressed investor concerns about its reliance on silver. Copenhagen-listed shares rose as much as 7% after it guided for largely flat organic growth in 2026 alongside its quarterly earnings report, and said it would introduce platinum-plated jewelry after the price of silver had more than doubled over the past year. Shares were last seen trading 4.9% higher. \"If you look at our volatility of silver, one of the things that we have to [do] for the company is to decouple that from the silver trading,\" CEO Berta de Pablos-Barbier told CNBC's \"Squawk Box Europe.\"\"Varying our basket from new metals is going to help us, because we will not be so dependent on only one metal, which is today silver,\" she said, adding that about 60% of Pandora's business today was silver. While spot silver was down over 12% early Thursday at around $80 an ounce, it is still up more than 150% from about $30 an ounce a year ago.Analysts have warned that the volatile price of silver was a \"pernicious problem\" for the Danish jeweler. A more pressured consumer has also impacted sales. Jefferies analysts on Tuesday said investors will be hesitant to engage with Pandora given recent silver moves. \"The challenges of the last few months will mean, even in a more normal silver price world, [Pandora] will remain substantially cheaper than even a year ago.\"Pandora stock has fallen around 60% over the past 12 months. Cautious consumersThis year, Pandora expects organic growth to land somewhere between negative 1% and 2%, and a profit (earnings before interest and tax) margin of between 21% and 22%.De Pablos-Barbier, who took up the role as CEO last month, told CNBC that moving to a platinum-plated material and expanding its portfolio would allow the company to keep margins in the 20's. In the fourth quarter, organic growth was 4% as demand in the U.S. market, which accounts for about a third of its business, remained soft.\"The reality is that we are seeing the lowest consumer sentiment since the 60s in that market,\" De Pablos-Barbier said. \"This is nothing I can control, what I can control is what I bring to the brand and how much excitement and new products I can bring to the U.S. consumers, so that they continue to be loyal and they continue to come to our stores.\"Like-for-like growth, which measures sales across comparable stores, was flat in the quarter as well as during the first month of 2026, Pandora said.watch nowIt was also the first quarter of negative like-for-like growth since late 2022 in Pandora's strategically important \"Fuel with More\" segment, which focuses on expanding beyond the traditional charms it's known for into new categories like rings, necklaces and lab-grown diamonds, Citi analysts noted. \"Extreme precious metals inflation has materially reduced earnings visibility,\" the analysts said. \"Near-term confidence is further undermined by a volatile US and European macro backdrop (~80% of sales) and potential signs of brand fatigue and broader jewellery consumption softening.\"The jeweler posted a 6% organic growth for 2025, preannounced in January, down from 13% in the previous year and missing its own guidance of between 7% and 8%.",

Kyle Grillot | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesAfter Anthropic took aim at OpenAI's ad push in a new Super Bowl campaign on Wednesday, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman shared a post on X calling the ads \"funny\" but \"clearly dishonest.\"OpenAI said last month that it will begin testing ads with its free users and ChatGPT Go subscribers in the U.S., and Anthropic announced Wednesday that the company plans to keep its chatbot Claude ad-free. Anthropic seized on the opportunity and took a not-so-subtle swipe at its rival with its Super Bowl campaign, which centers around Anthropic's decision to keep ads out of Claude. Anthropic will air a 60-second pregame ad and a 30-second in-game ad that both feature the tag line, \"Ads are coming to AI. But not to Claude.\"Altman said the commercials are \"deceptive\" and that OpenAI would \"obviously never run ads in the way Anthropic depicts them.\"\"We are not stupid and we know our users would reject that,\" Altman wrote. \"I guess it's on brand for Anthropic doublespeak to use a deceptive ad to critique theoretical deceptive ads that aren't real, but a Super Bowl ad is not where I would expect it.\" Read more CNBC tech newsAlphabet resets the bar for AI infrastructure spendingSoftware experiencing 'most exciting moment' as AI fears hammer the stocksSnap shares rise on fourth-quarter earnings that beat on salesQualcomm stock sinks as memory shortage drags on forecastA representative for Anthropic did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment. Anthropic was founded in 2021 by a group of former OpenAI researchers who left the company due to disagreements over its direction. The two startups have been fierce rivals since Anthropic's inception, and they've both raised billions of dollars of capital as they've jostled for users, enterprise customers and market share. Altman said Wednesday that \"Anthropic wants to control what people do with AI\" and that the company \"serves an expensive product to rich people.\" He said OpenAI also has more free users than Anthropic does, which means OpenAI has \"a differently-shaped problem than they do.\"OpenAI said last month that ads within ChatGPT will be clearly labeled, appear at the bottom of the chatbot's answers and will not influence ChatGPT's responses.\"As for our Super Bowl ad: it's about builders, and how anyone can now build anything,\" Altman wrote.

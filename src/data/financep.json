    "body": "Urenco USA enriched uranium storage capsules.Adam Jeffery | CNBCThe Department of Energy announced Wednesday an initiative aimed at building out the nation's nuclear fuel supply chain as interest in the emissions-free power source grows.The DOE is asking states to express interest in hosting \"Nuclear Lifecycle Innovation Campuses,\" which would support activities across the nuclear fuel lifecycle – including recycling used fuel. Only about 5% of the value of the energy is used by a reactor, meaning the used fuel has the potential to be recycled. At present there is no commercial-scale uranium recycling in the U.S. The DOE said this would also redirect spent uranium from ultimately being sent to Yucca Mountain. Ultimately, one of the proposed campuses could house the entire fuel cycle from enrichment all the way to recycling. The sites could also potentially have advanced reactors, power generation and co-located data centers, since it's easier to do everything under one roof rather than having to transport fuel.Given the surge in interest for nuclear power – driven in part by the enormous power needs of hyperscalers – the department said one of these campuses could attract $50 billion in capital investment from the private sector.\"Unleashing the next American nuclear renaissance will drive innovation, fuel economic growth, and create good-paying American jobs while delivering the affordable, reliable and secure energy America needs to power its future,\" said U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright. He added it will be an \"opportunity to work directly with states on regional priorities that support President Trump's vision to revitalize America's nuclear base.\"Nuclear accounts for about 21% of U.S. power, but the country is dependent on imports for much of its uranium.Earlier this year, the DOE announced $2.7 billion in funding aimed at boosting the country's enrichment facilities, including $900 million that was awarded to Centrus to expand production at its Piketon, Ohio, plant. The facility hasn't yet reached commercial scale.The Trump administration has made nuclear power a cornerstone of its national energy policy. President Donald Trump signed a series of executive orders last May that aim to speed the deployment of nuclear reactors, big and small, by cutting regulations.The administration inked a deal last fall with Westinghouse owners Cameco and Brookfield Asset Management to spend $80 billion building its large nuclear reactor design across the U.S. The DOE has several initiatives to speed the deployment of small, advanced reactors.Wright said in November that most of the department's loan money will go toward building nuclear plants.\"When we leave office three years and three months from now, I want to see hopefully dozens of nuclear plants under construction,\" Wright said at the time.",

    "body": "watch nowPresident Donald Trump has \"brought down the temperature\" on Minnesota, the site of major civil unrest over aggressive federal immigration efforts, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Wednesday.Trump is \"urging\" Congress to take action to avoid triggering a partial government shutdown amid disputes over federal funding for the Department of Homeland Security, Bessent told CNBC's \"Squawk on the Street.\"The shutdown could begin at 12:01 a.m. ET on Saturday unless lawmakers come to a resolution on the DHS funding, which a slew of Democrats have rejected in light of the recent killing of nurse Alex Pretti by federal agents in Minneapolis.Trump is \"in constant contact\" with lawmakers \"and he is urging them not to shut down the government,\" Bessent told CNBC.Bessent spoke as the Trump administration tempers its tone after its harsh initial response to two immigration enforcement-related killings in Minneapolis that stirred waves of outrage from Democrats and even some Republicans.The Cabinet secretary declined to make a prediction about whether a shutdown — the second in less than four months — will be averted.\"I don't know what to expect. The Democrats can become unhinged like they were last time, and they don't care. Like, they think this is a way to stop President Trump,\" he said.He also warned that another shutdown could cause further economic harm. \"Especially on the service side, when the government shut down, that never comes back. So, there's a big permanent loss,\" Bessent said.The House of Representatives last week passed a more-than-$1.2 trillion spending package that includes funding for DHS, the agency in charge of federal immigration enforcement.The package, which accounts for the bulk of government spending for the fiscal year ending Sept. 30, requires Democratic support to clear the Senate's 60-vote filibuster threshold. And if the Senate changes what the House already passed, the House would have to return from a prescheduled recess to vote on any amended measure, with little time to spare before a shutdown.Democratic opposition to the spending package rapidly grew after Pretti's killing on Saturday morning. Senate Democrats now say they will vote against the package unless the DHS portion is stripped out, something Republicans have signaled they will not do.Pretti was killed just weeks after another U.S. citizen, Renee Nicole Good, was fatally shot by federal agents in Minneapolis.In both cases, the Trump administration initially came out in full-throated defense of its officers' actions while accusing the slain citizens of domestic terrorism. After widespread blowback — and after new polls showed Trump's immigration approval rating plummeting — the administration has dialed back its tone.Trump said Tuesday, \"we're going to de-escalate a bit\" in Minnesota.But Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., has suggested that that pivot is not enough for Democrats to drop the shutdown threat.\"The fix should come from Congress; the public can't trust the administration to do the right thing on its own,\" Schumer said Tuesday on the Senate floor.\"In the meantime, I will vote no on any legislation that funds [U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement] until it is reined in and overhauled, and Senate Democrats are overwhelmingly united on this issue,\" Schumer said.This is breaking news.

    "body": "Elon Musk, chief executive officer of Tesla Inc., during the US-Saudi Investment Forum at the Kennedy Center in Washington, DC, US, on Wednesday, Nov. 19, 2025.Bloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesTesla plans to reports fourth-quarter earnings for 2025 after the bell on Wednesday.Here what Wall Street is expecting for the quarter, according to analysts polled by LSEG:Earnings per share: 45 cents expectedRevenue: $24.79 billion expectedRevenue has been sluggish in recent quarters for Tesla, as the company faces an onslaught of competition in various parts of the world, most notably from BYD in China. Analysts expect to see a drop in revenue for the third time in the past fourth quarters, with the average estimate showing a 3.6% decline from $25.7 billion a year earlier. Revenue for the full year is expected to come in at about $95 billion, which would be a 2.8% slide from 2024 and represent the first annual drop on record for the company. Earlier this month, Tesla reported a 16% plunge in vehicle deliveries for the fourth quarter and 8.6% decline for the full year. Deliveries are the closest approximation of sales reported by Tesla, but are not precisely defined in the company's shareholder communications.While Tesla's core business has been struggling, CEO Elon Musk has tried to focus investor attention elsewhere. In particular, he's touted the company's nascent Robotaxi business and its Optimus humanoid robots, which have yet to hit the market. Following a brutal start to 2025, Tesla's stock bounced back and ended the year up 11% after soaring in the third quarter. On the Say Technologies forum, which Tesla uses to solicit investor questions for earnings calls, some of the top-voted entries as of Tuesday were about the company's partially automated driving systems, marketed as Full Self-Driving (Supervised) in the U.S., and on its plans for a driverless ride-hailing service. In 2025, Tesla launched a Robotaxi-branded ride-hailing app, and the company has been running a pilot service in Austin, Texas. Last week, Tesla executives said they had taken human safety supervisors out of a handful of cars in the Austin fleet to conduct driverless passenger rides. The company also operates a ride-hail service, with human drivers behind the wheel, in the San Francisco area, where it doesn't have permission to operate driverless vehicles without a human at the wheel, even for testing purposes. Meanwhile, Alphabet's Waymo service continues to expand commercially in the U.S., and Baidu's Apollo Go keeps growing in Asia.Some investors submitted questions about Musk's other companies, including xAI and whether Tesla planned to invest in the artificial intelligence startup, and asked if Tesla shareholders will get any special access to invest in an eventual SpaceX IPO. Musk has said he wants to take his aerospace and defense contractor public in 2026. Capital expenditures will likely be another topic on the call, as investors wait to hear about the chip technology that will underpin Tesla's self-driving and robotics efforts. During Tesla's annual shareholder meeting in November, Musk said the company would be moving ahead with production of new chips with Samsung and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.Analysts polled by FactSet expect Tesla's capex to grow to $11 billion this year from a projected $9.5 billion in 2025.Tesla's call with analysts is scheduled to begin at 5:30 p.m. ET.

    "body": "The S&P 500 — a measure of the broad U.S. stock market — returned nearly 18% in 2025, the index's third straight year of double-digit gains. For the first time since 2022, however, the stocks from the rest of the world did even better. The MSCI EAFE Index, which tracks international stocks from developed nations, posted a return of roughly 32% last year, and the MSCI Emerging Markets Index, which tracks stocks from developing economies, posted a 34% return. With both indexes leading the S&P so far in 2025, it may be worth examining what role international stocks currently play in your portfolio. \"Nearly every investor that we speak to could probably benefit from adding some international allocations,\" Kristy Akullian, head of iShares investment strategy for the Americas at BlackRock, recently told CNBC Make It. It's not just a matter of investing in what's done well recently. Rather, after years of domestic stocks crushing their international rivals, many investor portfolios are heavily tilted toward U.S. names. Upping your exposure to international stocks may be a smart way to even things out, Akullian says. \"We know that most U.S. investors are very overweight U.S. equities. There is a very strong country bias,\" she says. \"And it's not a matter of being a little bit overweight relative to a broad benchmark; it is orders of magnitude more overweight.\"Why international stocks outperformed in 2025In 2025, international names began to turn the tide. For one thing, the global economy grew faster than the U.S. economy last year, with certain emerging nations, such as India and China, growing at an even faster clip — a trend analysts at Goldman Sachs expect to continue this year. Fiscal stimulus and announcements for increased European defense are among factors that bolstered returns in developed markets, Akullian says. And emerging markets, such as China and Taiwan, got a boost from the shift to artificial intelligence. \"Much of the production of the AI supply chain happens ... in emerging Asian markets,\" she says. \"They have been the beneficiary of some of the enthusiasm that we have seen for AI, and not just enthusiasm, but some of the capital expenditure and the investment that we have as a result of AI.\"Aiding foreign stocks across the board was a steady decline in the value of the U.S. dollar, meaning that American investors got more dollars for profits international companies earned in foreign currencies. \"If the dollar continues to break down, the first thing we'd look to do is to add international [stocks], because the dollar is such a key piece of that equation,\" says Jeffrey Buchbinder, chief equity strategist at LPL Financial.Why consider investing abroadSo where does that leave investors in 2026? Investing pros tend to caution against making any wholesale changes to your portfolio based on short-term moves in the market. You'd be wise to consult a financial professional before adjusting your strategy.But generally, spreading your portfolio across a wide variety of assets guarantees that one part of your portfolio is always \"working\" and smooths your performance over the long-term, experts say. And despite a long drought in recent years, foreign stocks do sometimes spend long periods leading U.S. names, as they did for the back half of the 1980s and much of the early 2000s, according to data from Hartford Funds. If you have next to no international exposure, consider diversifying, says Akullian. Adding emerging market stocks, she says, will get you exposure to companies in fast-growing economies while developed-market stocks may be a way to make your portfolio a little less reliant on the AI revolution. Just under 10% of the EAFE's stocks are in tech, compared with nearly 35% of the S&P 500. And with foreign stocks getting off the mat of late, it may not feel like you're leaving money on the table by diversifying, Akullian says. \"There are more ways to invest now where you can be deliberately more diversified, and the tradeoff is not quite as dark as it has been in previous years.\"Want to get ahead at work with AI?

    "body": "watch nowAmazon said Wednesday it plans to eliminate about 16,000 corporate jobs, marking its second round of mass job cuts since last October. In a blog post, the company wrote that the layoffs were part of an ongoing effort to \"strengthen our organization by reducing layers, increasing ownership, and removing bureaucracy.\" That coincides with a push to invest heavily in artificial intelligence. The job reductions come just a few months after October's layoffs, when 14,000 employees were let go across Amazon's corporate workforce. At the time, the company indicated the cuts would continue in 2026 as it found \"additional places we can remove layers.\"Beth Galetti, Amazon's senior vice president of people experience and technology, didn't rule out more job cuts in the future, but said the company isn't trying to create \"a new rhythm\" of broad layoffs every few months.\"That's not our plan,\" Galetti wrote in the blog post. \"But just as we always have, every team will continue to evaluate the ownership, speed, and capacity to invent for customers, and make adjustments as appropriate.\"On Tuesday, some employees in Amazon's cloud unit received an email sent in an apparent error acknowledging \"organizational changes\" at the company. The note referenced a post from Galetti and said Amazon notified \"impacted colleagues in our organization.\"Read more CNBC tech newsApple, Google host dozens of AI 'nudify' apps like Grok, report findsBlockbuster social media trial kicks off, with more to come this yearMeta inks deal to pay Corning up to $6 billion for fiber-optic cables in AI data centersTikTok blames data center outages for U.S. app problems, denies censorship claimsAmazon had about 1.58 million employees as of the end of its third quarter.

David Ryder | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesAmazon has been in the midst of a significant downsizing for the past several years. The company laid off more than 27,000 employees between 2022 and 2023, and it conducted smaller cuts across various organizations in 2024. CEO Andy Jassy has looked to slim down Amazon's workforce after the company went on a hiring spree during the Covid-19 pandemic, partly to meet a surge in demand for e-commerce and cloud computing services. Jassy has also looked to reset Amazon's corporate culture so that it can operate like the \"world's largest startup.\" He set internal targets to slash management layers and established a \"no bureaucracy email alias\" to identify ways the company can innovate faster. Amazon has also been cutting costs across its business so that it can invest more in AI and the rapid build-out of data centers. Earlier this week, the company shuttered its Fresh and Go grocery chains after years of experimentation. Last October, Amazon said it expects capital expenditures to reach $125 billion for 2026, the highest spending forecast among the megacap companies.Jassy said last June that efficiency gains from AI would likely cause Amazon's corporate head count to fall in the coming years. \"We will need fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today, and more people doing other types of jobs,\" Jassy said at the time.watch now",

    "body": "Homes in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida, US, on Sunday, Jan. 11, 2026. Zak Bennett | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesAfter dropping sharply, mortgage interest rates rose last week for the first time in a month. That pushed total mortgage demand down 8.5% compared with the previous week, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association's seasonally adjusted index. The average contract interest rate for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages with conforming loan balances, $832,750 or less, increased to 6.24% from 6.16%, with points rising to 0.55 from 0.54, including the origination fee, for loans with a 20% down payment. That was the highest rate in three weeks.As a result, applications to refinance a home loan dropped 16% for the week, but they were still 156% higher than the same week one year ago. That is because rates a year ago were 78 basis points higher.  \"FHA refinance activity bucked the overall trend and increased, as FHA rates remained almost 20 basis points lower than conforming rates,\" said Joel Kan, MBA's vice president and deputy chief economist, in a release. \"With rates holding in the 6 percent range, the refinance market is likely to remain sensitive to week-to-week rate movements.\" Get Property Play directly to your inboxCNBC's Property Play with Diana Olick covers new and evolving opportunities for the real estate investor, delivered weekly to your inbox.Subscribe here to get access today.Applications for a mortgage to purchase a home were essentially flat, down 0.4% from one week earlier and 18% higher year over year. Homebuyers are still facing a very pricey market. There is more supply than last year, but most of it is on the high end.\"The average loan size stayed at its highest level since September 2025,\" Kan added.Mortgage rates moved slightly lower to start this week, according to a separate survey from Mortgage News Daily. The next chance for a sizeable move in rates in either direction comes Wednesday with the latest meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee. Most expect it to keep its benchmark interest rate unchanged, but markets will be ready to react to commentary from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell.",

    "body": "FILE PHOTO: U.S. President Donald Trump meets with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi at the White House in Washington, D.C., U.S., February 13, 2025. Kevin Lamarque | ReutersA renewed push to conclude a U.S.-India trade deal may get underway, analysts say, as the White House sees other countries and power blocs working harder than ever to remove barriers to trade and tariffs.The urgency and impetus to get talks over the line could come after the EU and India signed off on a long-awaited trade deal on Tuesday, with the agreement seeing both sides phase out tariffs on the vast majority of each other's imports. \"The EU–India deal could ... light a fire under efforts to conclude a U.S.–India trade deal and help to move negotiations forward on a comprehensive bilateral trade agreement,\" Mark Linscott, nonresident senior fellow on India at the Atlantic Council, commented Tuesday.Trump has yet to react to the EU-India deal, which was two decades in the making, but Washington could view bilateral trade agreements between other powerful nations with concern and as a potential threat.The U.S. already has a trade deal with the EU (which has maintained 15% tariffs on EU exports to the States) but when it comes to the U.S.' own stalled trade talks with India — a country it imposed a 50% tariff on — it certainly leaves negotiations in more uncertain territory.But according to Atlantic Council expert Linscott there is no need for a U.S.-India deal to be derailed. \"While the agreement may be interpreted as a response to the Trump administration's tariffs and tariff threats, there is no reason it should undermine the U.S. trade relationships with either the EU or India,\" he said. India's oil and gas minister told CNBC on Tuesday that a U.S.-India trade deal was at a \"very advanced stage\" but conceded he didn't have a timeline for the conclusion of a deal.watch now\"I would try and look at the positive side, I'm not a soothsayer, I don't know when trade deals will get signed, how long it takes ... but I think one [everybody] needs to chill a bit,\" he told CNBC's Amitoj Singh, as India and the EU announced a landmark trade deal.\"I'm told by the people who are in it [the negotiations] that it's at a very advanced stage, and I'm hoping that, sooner rather than later, it will also see the light of day,\" he added of the U.S. deal.Sticking pointsThe EU and India described their agreement as the \"mother of all deals\" and while the accord sees the two countries ally themselves at a time when global trade is under strain from tariffs, sanctions, and geopolitical rivalry, it does not reduce India's desire for a deal with the U.S., analysts at global risk consultancy Teneo noted.The deal \"reduces (though not eliminates) the pressure on India to conclude a deal with the US which remains its largest trade (in both goods and services) and defense partner,\" analysts Arpit Chaturvedi and Carsten Nickel said in emailed comments Tuesday.Read moreCiti analysts said Wednesday that markets will be \"keenly watching immediate repercussions\" of the EU-India deal on India-U.S. tariff talks. \"There would be hope that those negotiations might be fast-tracked now though it remains to be seen whether Indian authorities would be in a better position to withstand the higher U.S. tariffs given the easier access to the large EU market.\"watch nowShumita Deveshwar, chief India economist at TS Lombard, noted that there were a number of sticking points preventing an immediate agreement.\"A free trade deal with the EU after nearly 2 decades of negotiations couldn't come at a better time for India, which is struggling to strike an agreement with the U.S.,\" she said in emailed analysis Wednesday.\"Trade talks with the U.S. are stuck owing to its insistence on getting greater access to India's farm market and for India to stop buying cheap Russian oil ...Agriculture is a highly politically sensitive sector in India given the low level of farm mechanisation and vast numbers of subsistence farmers. However, India does seem to be scaling back its Russian oil purchases,\" she said, noting such purchases had fallen to their lowest level in two years in December.",

Appearing together at a forum in the French capital as they seek to shore up support from European allies, the political leaders sought to portray a united front amid U.S. President Donald Trump's Greenland threats. \"The world order as we know it that we have been fighting for 80 years is over and I don't think it will return,\" Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said at Science Po University in Paris, according to Reuters.\"The best way forward for the U.S, Europe is to stick together … We will try to find a way forward with U.S. We share concerns on Arctic security. Russia does not want peace with Europe,\" she added. Greenland's Nielsen, meanwhile, said the self-governing Danish territory agrees that there is a need for more surveillance and security in the Arctic \"because of the way Russia acts now.\" He added that Greenland would not give in to foreign pressure.\"What we are dealing with as a government is trying to push back from outside and handle our people who are afraid and scared,\" Nielsen said.The comments come shortly after Nielsen and Frederiksen held talks with German Chancellor Friedrich Merz in Berlin on Tuesday. Trump, who has long advocated for control of Greenland, said in a surprise development last week that he had secured a framework of a future deal with respect to Greenland. The U.S. president did not give further details at the time, although he said talks would continue to reach an agreement.Opinion polls have shown that Greenlanders overwhelmingly oppose U.S. control, while a strong majority support independence from Denmark.Nielsen and Frederiksen are both expected to meet with French President Emmanuel Macron at the Élysée Palace in Paris later in the day.",

    "body": "U.S. President Donald Trump speaks to reporters about the Israel-Iran conflict, aboard Air Force One on June 24, 2025, while traveling to attend the NATO summit in The Hague in the Netherlands.Brendan Smialowski | Afp | Getty ImagesU.S. President Donald Trump warned Iran on Wednesday that an \"armada\" was heading toward it and that it should \"make a deal\" with the U.S. on its contested nuclear program or face a large-scale U.S. military attack.\"A massive Armada is heading to Iran. It is moving quickly, with great power, enthusiasm, and purpose. It is a larger fleet, headed by the great Aircraft Carrier Abraham Lincoln, than that sent to Venezuela,\" Trump posted on Truth Social. \"Like with Venezuela, it is, ready, willing, and able to rapidly fulfill its mission, with speed and violence, if necessary,\" he added.Trump said he hoped Iran would come to the table to negotiate \"a fair and equitable deal\" regarding its nuclear weapons program.\"Time is running out, it is truly of the essence,\" Trump said.\"As I told Iran once before, MAKE A DEAL! They didn't, and there was \"Operation Midnight Hammer,\" a major destruction of Iran. The next attack will be far worse! Don't make that happen again,\" the president added.'Operation Midnight Hammer' refers to a U.S.-led operation in June 2025 to destroy several key Iranian nuclear facilities that the U.S. said were being used to enrich uranium for use in nuclear weapons.It's not the first warning to Tehran that U.S. military assets were being moved toward the Middle East. Last week, Trump said an \"armada\" was heading toward Iran but that he hoped he didn't have to use it. That warning came after authorities' brutal clampdown on nationwide protests in Iran.Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi said Wednesday that he had not been in contact with U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff in recent days or requested negotiations, Reuters reported, citing Iranian state media.The U.S. has used a variety of sanctions targeting Iran's illicit oil trade, as well as military threats and action, to try to bring Tehran to the negotiating table to halt its nuclear program. Trump pulled the U.S. out of an Obama-era nuclear deal in 2018, during his first term in office, saying the deal was \"decaying and rotten.\"Trump said in March 2025 that he wanted to renegotiate a nuclear deal with Iran after reimposing a \"maximum pressure\" campaign on the Islamic Republic but efforts to renew talks appear to have failed.Iran was back on the president's radar last month, however, after public unrest erupted over ongoing economic hardship in the country and its religious-conservative leadership.Iran's security services' crackdown on the protests, mass arrests and threatened executions prompted Trump to warn Iran that he would use military action against the country if it \"violently kills\" protestors. He then suggested the threat had worked, leading to a temporary de-escalation of tensions with the White House. Some reports suggest that the death toll during the unrest could top 30,000 people, but Iranian-focused human rights group HRANA says 6,221 people are confirmed to have died, while over 17,000 deaths are still under investigation. The total number of arrests has reached 42,324, HRANA reported Tuesday.",

By exiting these remaining unprofitable doors, we are taking actions to reduce costs and support the long-term health of the business.\"Allbirds said it will continue to operate two outlet stores in the U.S. and two full-price stores in London.The sustainable shoe company got its start in Silicon Valley and flourished during the direct-to-consumer boom, making its initial public offering in 2021. It joined a number of DTC companies that sought to build their customer bases through physical retail and banked on opening stores to boost balance sheets.Now, as rents rise, physical retail loses its shine and being digitally native becomes more important, Allbirds and other DTC companies have begun to shift their focus. The sneaker company has previously announced gradual store closures across the country.In its third-quarter earnings report, in November, the company said its net revenue took a 23.3% hit from the same period a year ago, primarily due to impacts from international distributor changes and physical store closures. Compared with last year, net revenue from stores in the U.S. decreased by roughly 20%. Allbirds has a $32 million market cap but has seen its stock plunge more than 80% over the past two years. ",

    "body": "People walk onto an escalator under a Starbucks coffee sign in Manhattan on Dec. 2, 2025 in New York City. Spencer Platt | Getty ImagesStarbucks on Wednesday reported mixed quarterly results as the company's turnaround propels traffic growth for the first time in two years but weighs on its bottom line.\"Our Q1 results demonstrate our 'Back to Starbucks' strategy is working and we believe we're ahead of schedule,\" CEO Brian Niccol said in a statement. \"It's great to see the sales momentum driven by more customers choosing Starbucks more often, and this is just the beginning.\"The company also shared its first financial outlook since suspending its forecast in October 2024. For fiscal 2026, Starbucks is projecting adjusted earnings per share in a range of $2.15 to $2.40, on the lower end of Wall Street's estimates of $2.35 per share, according to LSEG. The company is also expecting global and U.S. same-store sales growth of at least 3%.Shares of Starbucks rose nearly 5% in early trading.Here's what the company reported for the quarter ended Dec. 28 compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:Earnings per share: 56 cents adjusted vs. 59 cents expectedRevenue: $9.92 billion vs. $9.67 billion expectedThe coffee giant reported fiscal first-quarter net income attributable to Starbucks of $293.3 million, or 26 cents per share, down from $780.8 million, or 69 cents per share, a year earlier. In addition to costs related to the turnaround, higher coffee prices and tariffs weighed on the company's margins during the quarter.Excluding restructuring costs, impairment charges and other items, Starbucks earned 56 cents per share.Net sales rose 6% to $9.92 billion, driven by the company's second straight quarter of same-store sales growth.\"We're seeing exactly what we want to see in our top line at this point in our turnaround,\" CFO Cathy Smith said on the company's earnings conference call.Global same-store sales increased 4%, topping StreetAccount estimates of 2.3%. Traffic grew 3%, marking the first time that the company's transactions have grown in two years. Moreover, Starbucks saw transaction growth from both loyalty program members and nonmembers for the first time since the second quarter of fiscal 2022, according to Niccol.The company's same-store sales growth has continued into January, according to Smith.U.S. same-store sales also rose 4%, fueled by demand for its holiday offerings, like its viral \"Bearista\" cup and classics menu items like the peppermint mocha. In November, Niccol said the holiday menu launch was the best-ever day for the company's North American business.Niccol also credited the company's \"Green Apron Service\" program, which focuses on hospitality and efficiency inside its cafes to improve the customer experience. Outside the U.S., Starbucks' international same-store sales increased 5%.China, the company's second-largest market, saw same-store sales grow 7%. During the quarter, Starbucks announced its plans to form a joint venture with Boyu Capital to run its business in China. \"This partnership will help us expand into more cities, deliver exceptional coffee experiences, create new career opportunities for partners, and strengthen Starbucks' position as a global brand for long-term growth,\" Niccol said on the company's earnings conference call.The deal is expected to close in the second quarter of fiscal 2026, pending regulatory approval. Starbucks' fiscal 2026 forecast assumes that the company will keep operating Starbucks China's retail stores in the second half of the fiscal year.The company also opened 128 net new locations during the quarter.In fiscal 2026, Starbucks plans to open 600 to 650 net new company-owned and licensed cafes. The development comes on the heels of the company shuttering roughly 400 U.S. locations last year.Investors are expecting to hear more details about Niccol's strategy on Thursday at an investor day held in New York City. Executives will also share the company's new long-term financial targets.",

    "body": "watch nowCrude oil prices rose Wednesday, after President Donald Trump warned Iran that a \"massive Armada\" is heading in its direction and time is running out to make a deal on its nuclear program.Global benchmark Brent rose 83 cents, or 1.23%, to close at $68.40 per barrel. U.S. crude oil gained 82 cents, or 1.31%, to settle at $63.21. \"A massive Armada is heading to Iran. It is moving quickly, with great power, enthusiasm, and purpose,\" Trump said in a post on his social media platform Truth Social on Wednesday. U.S. Central Command said Monday that the Abraham Lincoln Carrier Strike Group had arrived in the Middle East \"to promote regional security and stability.\"Trump had threatened to attack Iran if it killed protestors during a mass uprising earlier this month. Thousands of people died after the Islamic Republic cracked down on the unrest. But the U.S. president has held back from military intervention so far.Trump said the fleet deployed to the Middle East is larger than the forces he ordered to the Caribbean before the U.S. captured former Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro. \"Like with Venezuela, it is, ready, willing, and able to rapidly fulfill its mission, with speed and violence, if necessary,\" Trump said of the carrier strike group Tuesday in the social media post. He called for Tehran to make a deal on its nuclear program. \"Time is running out, it is truly of the essence! As I told Iran once before, MAKE A DEAL!,\" Trump said. The president warned Iran that a possible attack would be worse than the bombing campaign he ordered last June on the Islamic Republic's nuclear facilities. \"The next attack will be far worse! Don't make that happen again,\" he said.",

    "body": "Mark Zuckerberg, chief executive officer of Meta Platforms Inc., wears a pair of Meta Oakley Vanguard AI glasses during the Meta Connect event in Menlo Park, California, US, on Wednesday, Sept. 17, 2025.David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesMeta on Wednesday will report fourth-quarter earnings, and investors will be looking for any signs that its revamped artificial intelligence strategy will benefit the company in 2026.Here's what analysts polled by LSEG are expecting:Earnings per share: $8.23 estimatedRevenue: $58.59 billion estimatedMeta spent a large chunk of 2025 overhauling its AI unit, including investing $14.3 billion in Scale AI to land the startup's founder, Alexandr Wang, and several of his colleagues.Wang oversees Meta's top-tier TBD unit that is tasked with developing powerful AI models. The company set up TBD after its Llama 4 model launched to tepid response from developers last spring. Meta has been testing a new frontier model and Llama successor code-named Avocado, and plans to release it during the first half of the year, CNBC reported.Underpinning Meta's AI efforts has been a major data center build-out while rivals like OpenAI and Alphabet do the same. Meta on Tuesday said it committed to paying glass manufacturing giant Corning up to $6 billion through 2030 for fiber-optic cable in its AI data centers.Although investors have been spooked by Meta's costly artificial intelligence investments, CEO Mark Zuckerberg has characterized the moves as necessary given AI's rapid pace of development.  \"Being able to make a significantly larger investment here is very likely to be a profitable thing over, over some period,\" Zuckerberg told analysts in October.Meta's capital expenditures, related to its data center push, are projected to come in at $21.97 billion for the quarter, according to StreetAccount.The company is expected to report $56.98 billion in online advertising sales for the fourth quarter, according to StreetAccount.Wall Street expects fourth-quarter daily active people to come in at 3.58 billion.Investors will also be monitoring what Zuckerberg has to say about the company's Reality Labs unit, which builds the virtual reality, augmented reality and wearable technology intended to power the so-called metaverse.Earlier this month, Meta laid off more than 1,000 Reality Labs employees who worked on VR-related initiatives, including internal studios, as part of a shifting of resources to AI and related wearable devices, like the Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses. Although Meta tech chief Andrew Bosworth told media outlets last week that Meta is not halting its VR efforts, the company's outsized impact on that industry has chilled some developers and sparked fears of a VR winter, CNBC reported.Analysts estimate Reality Labs to post a fourth-quarter operating loss of $5.67 billion on $940.8 million in sales. That unit has had over $70 billion in total operating losses since late 2020.WATCH: TikTok finalizes deal to stay in the U.S.watch now",

    "body": "Alex Dhillon, CEO and founder of OuttakeCourtesy: Abiola FamilusiAlex Dhillon spent almost five years at Palantir before leaving to build cybersecurity startup Outtake. Now his former boss is helping fuel his new company's growth, alongside a roster of investors that includes Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella. Outtake, which counts OpenAI and Bill Ackman's Pershing Square among its customers, has just raised a fresh $40 million, the company said Wednesday. The startup, founded in 2023, uses autonomous artificial intelligence agents to help companies detect and quickly remove cyberthreats like phishing, through a variety of applications, including email verification. \"We're headed towards this world of always-on security,\" Dhillon said in an interview. \"You need agent tech solutions like Outtake, defending your neighborhood.\"The funding round was led by venture firm Iconiq, with participation from CRV, S32 and angel investors Nadella as well as Palo Alto Networks CEO Nikesh Arora, Anduril co-founder Trae Stephens, and Ackman. Palantir tech chief Shyam Sankar was another angel investor in the company and contributed to the newest round. Dhillon didn't disclose the valuation, but the 35-person company said that annual recurring revenue has increased about sixfold year over year, and that its systems scanned 20 million potential cyberattacks last year. Outtake also said it has grown enterprise customers more than tenfold year over year. Dhillon said that AI has raised the sophistication and pace of cyberthreats, and that his company is building a \"trust layer for the Internet.\"H/O: Outtake CEO and founder Alex Dhillon with teamCourtesy: Abiola FamilusiIconiq general partner Murali Joshi, who is joining Outtake's board, said the company's growth rate, strong customer feedback and market opportunity are among the reasons the firm invested. \"What they've built, from a product perspective, is so fundamentally differentiated relative to everything else that's been on the market,\" Joshi told CNBC. Outtake's technology is used by AppLovin, federal agencies, luxury retail brands and popular AI labs. Dhillon, who worked on Palantir's AI platforms, said the company plans to use some of the funding to grow its go-to-market teams, including engineering and product. \"We need agents manning the walls, because we're getting hammered every day,\" Dhillon said. \"That's, frankly, what's both thrilling and frightening about our space, and in that lie opportunity.\"Outtake previously raised $16.5 million in a Series A funding round led by CRV in April, and $3.5 million in a seed round.WATCH: Dan Ives' top AI stocks for 2026",

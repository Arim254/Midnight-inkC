    "body": "A hiring sign is displayed in the window of a business in Manhattan on Nov. 27, 2025 in New York City.Spencer Platt | Getty ImagesThe U.S. labor market slowdown intensified in November as private companies cut 32,000 workers, with small businesses hit the hardest, payrolls processing firm ADP reported Wednesday.With worries intensifying over the domestic jobs picture, ADP indicated the issues were worse than anticipated. The payrolls decline marked a sharp step down from October, which saw an upwardly revised gain of 47,000 positions, and was well below the Dow Jones consensus estimate from economists for an increase of 40,000.Larger businesses, entailing companies with 50 or more employees, actually reported a net gain of 90,000 workers.However, establishments with fewer than 50 workers saw a decline of 120,000, including a drop of 74,000 among firms with 20 to 49 employees. The total loss was the biggest drop since March 2023.Education and health services led gainers with 33,000 hires, while leisure and hospitality added 13,000. But a broad-based decline across industries drove the total lower.The biggest loss came in professional and business services, which saw a decline of 26,000. Others shedding jobs included information services (-20,000), manufacturing (-18,000), and financial activities and construction, both of which saw losses of 9,000.The rate of pay also slowed, with workers staying in their jobs seeing a 4.4% year-over-year increase, down 0.1 percentage point from October.\"Hiring has been choppy of late as employers weather cautious consumers and an uncertain macroeconomic environment,\" said ADP's chief economist, Nela Richardson. \"And while November's  slowdown was broad-based, it was led by a pullback among small businesses.\"The ADP report is the last jobs picture the Federal Reserve gets before it meets Dec. 9-10. Futures traders are assigning a nearly 90% probability that the central bank will approve another quarter percentage point cut in its key interest rate, despite misgivings from some officials over whether further easing is needed. The probability was about the same following the ADP release.In recent weeks, Fed policymakers have expressed a divergence of opinions. One side sees cuts as necessary to head off further labor market troubles, while the other worries that additional reductions could aggravate inflation, which has held considerably above the Fed's 2% target.The Bureau of Labor Statistics will release its take on the nonfarm payrolls picture on Dec. 16, a date delayed because of the government shutdown.",

    "body": "Nurphoto | Getty ImagesAnthropic, the AI startup behind the popular Claude chatbot, is in early talks to launch one of the largest initial public offerings as early as next year, the Financial Times reported Wednesday. For the potential IPO, Anthropic has engaged law firm Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati, which has previously worked on high-profile tech IPOs such as Google, LinkedIn and Lyft, the FT said, citing two sources familiar with the matter.The start-up, led by chief executive Dario Amodei, was also pursuing a private funding round that could value it above $300 billion, including a $15 billion combined commitment from Microsoft and Nvidia, per the report. It added that Anthropic has also discussed a potential IPO with major investment banks, but that sources characterized the discussions as preliminary and informal. If true, the news could position Anthropic in a race to market with rival ChatGPT-maker OpenAI, which is also reportedly laying the groundwork for a public offering. The potential listings would also test investors' appetite for loss-making AI startups amid growing fears of a so-called AI bubble. However, an Anthropic spokesperson told the FT: \"It's fairly standard practice for companies operating at our scale and revenue level to effectively operate as if they are publicly traded companies,\" adding that no decisions have been made on timing or whether to go public.CNBC was unable to reach Anthropic and Wilson Sonsini, which has advised Anthropic for a few years, for comment. According to one of the FT's sources, Anthropic has been working through internal preparations for a potential listing, though details were not provided. The FT report follows several notable changes at the company of late, including the hiring of former Airbnb executive Krishna Rao, who played a key role in the firm's 2020 IPO.CNBC also reported last month that Anthropic was recently valued to the range of $350 billion after receiving investments of up to $5 billion from Microsoft and $10 billion from Nvidia. In its race to overtake OpenAI in the AI space, the startup has also been expanding aggressively, recently announcing a $50 billion AI infrastructure build-out with data centers in Texas and New York, and tripling its international workforce.According to the FT report, investors in the company are enthusiastic about Anthropic's potential IPO, which could see it \"seize the initiative\" from OpenAI.While OpenAI has been rumoured to be considering an IPO, its chief financial officer recently said the company is not pursuing a near-term listing, even as it closed a $6.6 billion share sale at a $500 billion valuation in October.",

David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesPresident Donald Trump on Wednesday proposed big cuts to strict fuel economy standards for passenger cars enacted under the Biden administration. \"We are officially terminating Joe Biden's ridiculously burdensome, horrible actually, CAFE standards that imposed expensive restrictions,\" Trump said at the Oval Office, flanked by the CEOs of Ford Motor and Stellantis.The Corporate Average Fuel Economy, or CAFE, standards date back to 1975 and have been tightened over the years to make vehicles more efficient.Former President Joe Biden had required automakers to increase the fuel efficiency of passenger cars and light trucks to about 50 miles per gallon by 2031. These stricter standards were expected to stimulate the production and sale of electric vehicles in the U.S. The standards proposed by the Trump administration would require cars to get about 34 miles to the gallon by 2031, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Trump has sought to dismantle pollution regulations and federal support for electric vehicles as well as renewable energy since taking office.  The oil industry group the American Petroleum Institute has lobbied the Trump administration to repeal the Biden fuel economy standards, contending that they aim to phase out liquid fuel vehicles.The announcement was attended by Ford CEO Jim Farley and Stellantis CEO Antonio Filosa, as well as a plant manager for General Motors from Michigan.Ford CEO Jim Farley and Stellantis CEO Antonio Filosa listen as U.S. President Donald Trump announces new fuel economy standards, in the Oval Office at the White House in Washington, D.C., U.S., December 3, 2025. Brian Snyder | ReutersMany of the officials in attendance, including U.S. dealers, said the new standards are more in line with the vehicles customers want to buy rather than the more costly ones automakers have been pushed to produce due to regulations.Trump and other officials also touted the new regulations as assisting in vehicle affordability, which has been an ongoing concern for the automotive industry, as the average new vehicle purchased hovers around $50,000.The Alliance for Automotive Innovation, a trade group that represents the majority of automakers operating in the U.S., also praised the cuts.\"We're reviewing NHTSA's announcement, but we're glad the agency has proposed new fuel economy standards,\" John Bozzella, CEO of the organization, said in a statement. \"We've been clear and consistent: The current CAFE rules finalized under the previous administration are extremely challenging for automakers to achieve given the current marketplace for EVs.\"U.S. EV leader Tesla did not respond for comment regarding the reduced standards.— CNBC's Phil LeBeau and Lora Kolodny contributed to this report.",

    "body": "Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff delivers the keynote address at the start of the Dreamforce conference in San Francisco on Oct. 14, 2025.Jessica Christian | San Francisco Chronicle | Getty ImagesSalesforce reported better-than-expected earnings on Wednesday and topped Wall Street estimates with its revenue guidance for the fourth quarter. The stock rose 2% in extended trading. Here's how the company did in comparison with LSEG consensus:Earnings per share: $3.25 adjusted vs. $2.86 expectedRevenue: $10.26 billion vs. $10.27 billion expectedRevenue increased 8.6% from a year earlier in the fiscal third quarter, which ended on Oct. 31, according to a statement. Net income increased to $2.09 billion, or $2.19 per share, from $1.53 billion, or $1.58 per share, in the same quarter last year, boosted by a $263 million gain from strategic investments. Adjusted earnings per share exclude stock-based compensation.The Tableau data analytics business had a higher mix of cloud services than the company had predicted during the quarter, Robin Washington, Salesforce's chief operating and financial officer, said on a conference call with analysts. Revenue from on-premises Tableau and MuleSoft app integration products are recognized during the quarter, rather than over time. For the fiscal fourth quarter, Salesforce called for $3.02 to $3.04 in adjusted earnings per share on $11.13 billion to $11.23 billion in revenue. Analysts polled by LSEG had expected $3.04 per share and $10.9 billion in revenue. The guidance implies revenue growth of between 11% and 12%, with about 3 points coming from Informatica, the data management company Salesforce acquired for around $8 billion in November. At the same time, the guidance factors in the continued shift to the cloud for MuleSoft and Tableau, as well as ongoing weakness from marketing and commerce products, Washington said.Salesforce's stock has badly underperformed the broader tech sector this year, in part due to concerns about the potential of artificial intelligence replacing some of its product capabilities. As of Wednesday's close, the shares are down 29% in 2025, while the Nasdaq has gained about 21%.During the fiscal third quarter, Salesforce acquired startups Regrello, whose AI software performs tasks, and Waii, which uses AI to compose code for running queries on data based on a few words of human input. The company also introduced Agentforce AI software for managing IT service requests, and issued a $60 billion fiscal 2030 revenue target, surpassing analysts' projections.Annualized revenue from Agentforce, which automates sales and customer service workflows, jumped 330% from a year earlier to over $500 million. Salesforce said it has won over 9,500 paid deals to date, up from over 6,000 as of September.Free cash flow grew 22% to $2.18 billion, but the total was below StreetAccount's $2.24 billion consensus.This is developing news.

    "body": "French planemaker Airbus cut its delivery guidance early Wednesday after a series of issues related to its A320 aircraft.On Monday, reports emerged of a flaw said to affect dozens of A320-family aircraft. Airbus later said it had identified a quality issue regarding a \"limited number\" of metal panels, and that the source of the issue has been \"identified and contained.\" It came after the company ordered an immediate software fix for around 6,000 A320-series aircrafts on Friday, forcing a large chunk of it's narrow-body fleet to be grounded, stranding travellers worldwide.The Paris-traded stock dropped on the news of the panel issue. It fell nearly 7% Monday and Tuesday as investors appeared spooked by the prospect of more widespread quality issues, like the ones that embroiled its rival Boeing.The company attributed the revised delivery guidance to \"recent supplier quality issue on fuselage panels impacting its A320 Family delivery flow.\" The company is now targeting 790 commercial aircraft deliveries in 2025, 30 fewer than its previous guidance.It maintained its financial guidance given in late October, still seeing adjusted earnings before interest and taxes of 7 billion euros and free cash flow before customer financing of around 4.5 billion euros.Shares were up 4.3% as of 3:45 p.m. Paris time (9:45 a.m. ET) following the renewed guidance, issued early Wednesday morning. Stock Chart IconStock chart iconAirbus share price this year\"The 30 aircraft removed from the delivery guide this year are not all expected to require a parts change, but for now only require a non-destructive test to be performed,\" noted Jefferies analysts. \"As a reminder, this part is dual-sourced with only one of the supplier facing a quality escape, which has already been resolved at the production level.\"The issue with Airbus' fuselage panels was related to parts supplied by Spanish company Sofitec Aero, a person familiar with the matter, who preferred to remain anonymous, told CNBC.CNBC reached out to Sofitec Aero for comment.Sector-wide problemsThe software update Airbus issued followed a Oct. 30 incident where an Airbus A320, operated by JetBlue, experienced a sudden drop in altitude after a flight control issue, resulting in injuries. The plane, which was en route from Cancun, Mexico to New Jersey, made an emergency landing in Tampa, Florida. Airbus' woes come as rival Boeing has been battling stubborn quality issues and increased scrutiny after a door plug blew out mid-flight on a Alaska Airlines 737 MAX in January last year. There have been signs of recovery for the firm as CFO Jay Malave said Tuesday that Boeing expects deliveries of both its 737 and 787 jets to be up next year.CEO Kelly Ortberg, who was brought in last year to turn the company around, said the company was starting to see improvements in its business, including slashing its quarterly losses.— Laya Neelakandan contributed to this report",

    "body": "Homes in Hercules, California, US, on Wednesday, Nov. 12, 2025. David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesAfter rising for several weeks, mortgage rates moved decidedly lower last week, but not enough to make much of a difference in demand from current borrowers or potential homebuyers. Total mortgage application volume fell 1.4% for the week, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association's seasonally adjusted index. An additional adjustment was made for the Thanksgiving holiday. The average contract interest rate for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages with conforming loan balances, $806,500 or less, decreased to 6.32% from 6.40%, with points falling to 0.58 from 0.60, including the origination fee, for loans with a 20% down payment. \"Mortgage rates moved lower in line with Treasury yields, which declined on data showing a weaker labor market and declining consumer confidence,\" said Joel Kan, vice president and deputy chief economist at the MBA. Even with that drop, applications to refinance a home loan fell 4% for the week but were 109% higher than the same week one year ago, when interest rates were much higher.  Get Property Play directly to your inboxCNBC's Property Play with Diana Olick covers new and evolving opportunities for the real estate investor, delivered weekly to your inbox.Subscribe here to get access today.Applications for a mortgage to purchase a home rose 3% for the week and were 17% higher than the same week one year ago. Buyer demand has been pretty weak this fall, as still-elevated home prices, relatively high mortgage rates and uncertainty over the state of the economy all weigh on consumers.\"We continue to see mixed results each week as the broader economic outlook remains cloudy, even as cooling home-price growth and increasing for-sale inventory bring some buyers back into the market,\" Kan added. The adjustable-rate mortgage share of activity increased to 8% of total applications, as consumers continue to look for more savings. ARMs offer lower rates and can be fixed for up to 10 years. They tend to be more popular in higher rate environments.Interest rates were mixed to start this week. They rose sharply on Monday but then pulled back a little bit Tuesday, according to a separate survey from Mortgage News Daily. There wasn't much economic data to impact rates.\"That could change on Wednesday with the confluence of ADP and ISM Services--both capable of influencing the bond market, even before the shutdown data dynamics temporarily magnified private data's importance,\" wrote Matthew Graham, chief operating officer at Mortgage News Daily.",

    "body": "File: Then Apple Creative Director Alan Dye celebrates the launch of the July Issue at the new WIRED office on June 24, 2015 in San Francisco, California.Kimberly White | Getty ImagesApple's head of user interface design, Alan Dye, will join Meta, in a notable shift of executive talent in Silicon Valley. The iPhone maker confirmed Dye's departure on Wednesday and Apple CEO Tim Cook said in a statement that the company prioritizes design and has a strong team. The statement said that veteran designer Stephen Lemay will succeed Dye.\"Steve Lemay has played a key role in the design of every major Apple interface since 1999,\" Cook said in a statement. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg in a Wednesday social media post said that Dye would lead up a new creative studio that brings together design, fashion and technology. \"We plan to elevate design within Meta,\" wrote Zuckerberg, who did not say what specific products Dye will work on. Compared to other Silicon Valley companies, Apple has always emphasized design to customers and investors as one of its strengths. Apple prominently features its design executives to discuss interface changes at the company's launch events.In June, Dye revealed a redesign of Apple's software interface for iPhones, Macs and the Apple Watch called Liquid Glass. The company described it as an \"elegant\" new design with translucent buttons, updated app icons and fluid animations.  Dye said it was the \"next chapter\" of the company's software and said it \"sets the stage\" for the next era of Apple products. \"Our new design blurs the lines between hardware and software to create an experience that's more delightful than ever while still familiar and easy to use,\" Dye said at the launch. Reviews were mixed on the Liquid Glass update, which shipped with new iPhones in September. Apple announces liquid glass during the Apple Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) on June 9, 2025 in Cupertino, California.Justin Sullivan | Getty ImagesFor years, Apple design was embodied by executive Jony Ive, who left Apple in 2019 and is now working with OpenAI on artificial intelligence hardware alongside Sam Altman. Dye took over user interface design and became one of the design studio's leads in 2015 when Ive stepped back from a day-to-day role. Dye started at Apple in 2006 and worked on software for the iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple Watch, Apple TV and Vision Pro, according to his LinkedIn profile. He was also partly responsible for the first iPhone in 2017 that did away with the home screen button at the bottom of the device and replaced it with a software-based swipe-up motion. Meta has said in recent years that it wants to be a major developer of hardware and Zuckerberg has said Apple is one of his company's biggest competitors. The social media company currently makes several virtual reality headsets under its Quest brand, and recently scored its first hardware hit with Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses, which are stylish sunglasses equipped with cameras and the ability to run an AI model that can answer questions. Sales of the device tripled over the past year, Ray-Ban parent company EssilorLuxottica said in July. \"We're entering a new era where AI glasses and other devices will change how we connect with technology and each other,\" Zuckerberg wrote.Bloomberg first reported the move.

    "body": "watch nowMacy's on Wednesday beat Wall Street's sales expectations for the third quarter in a row and posted its strongest growth in more than three years as the company's turnaround strategy showed signs of momentum.The department store operator raised its full-year sales and earnings outlook after its better-than-expected fiscal third quarter. The retailer now expects adjusted earnings per share of between $2 and $2.20, up from its previous expectation of $1.70 to $2.05, and net sales of $21.48 billion to $21.63 billion, compared with its prior outlook of $21.15 billion and $21.45 billion.Macy's said it expects flat to roughly 0.5% comparable sales growth from the previous year. That compares with its previous expectations for a year-over-year decline of between 0.5% and 1.5%. The industry metric takes out one-time dynamics like store openings and closures, and Macy's includes merchandise that it owns, items for brands that pay for space within its stores and its third-party online marketplace.It marked the second consecutive quarter Macy's raised its full-year sales and earnings outlook. The company had cut its full-year earnings outlook in May because of higher tariffs, more promotions and \"some moderation\" in discretionary spending. Even so, the projected annual sales would represent a drop from year-ago net sales of $22.29 billion. Macy's said about $700 million of that annual net sales decrease is due to the 64 stores it shuttered at the end of the last fiscal year, which ended Feb. 1, and in the early part of this fiscal year. And Macy's said in its news release that its outlook anticipates two challenging dynamics – selective spending by consumers and higher tariffs – will persist in the holiday quarter.The company's shares fell about 1% on Wednesday.In an interview with CNBC, CEO Tony Spring said the company is taking a \"prudent view\" of the fourth quarter because it faces tough year-over-year comparisons and because it's not sure how \"aspirational customers,\" those who like to shop at its stores but are more financially pressured, may spend during the season.\"We're pleased with the fourth quarter to date, but we have a big holiday in front of us,\" he said. Spring said Macy's department store model is an advantage during the gift-giving season because it offers a wide variety of merchandise and a range of prices, from off-price to luxury.Here's how the department store operator did during its fiscal third quarter compared with what Wall Street expected, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:Earnings per share: 9 cents adjusted vs. an expected loss of 14 cents Revenue: $4.71 billion vs. $4.62 billion expectedMacy's is trying to put up better and more consistent sales, particularly for its namesake brand. Macy's department stores account for the majority of the New York City-based legacy retailer's business, but their performance has lagged behind the company's higher-end department store, Bloomingdale's, and beauty chain, Bluemercury. To try to reverse that trend, the retailer has stepped up investments in staffing, sharper merchandise and eye-catching displays at Macy's stores. It first rolled out that strategy at 50 locations, which were dubbed the \"First 50,\" and has since expanded that approach to a total of 125 Macy's locations. That's more than a third of the 350 namesake stores that Macy's plans to keep open.Along with the added investment, it has shuttered lower-performing Macy's locations. It announced in early 2024 that it would permanently close about 150 of its namesake stores by early 2027, while planning to add locations for Bloomingdale's and Bluemercury. The company hasn't yet said how many additional stores it may close this fiscal year. In the three-month period that ended Nov. 1, Macy's net income fell to $11 million, or 4 cents per share, compared with $28 million, or 10 cents per share, in the year-ago period. Adjusting for some one-time items, including gains on the sale of real estate, it reported earnings per share of 9 cents.Revenue decreased from $4.74 billion in the year-ago quarter.In the fiscal third quarter, companywide comparable sales rose 3.2% including owned and licensed merchandise and its third-party marketplace. When the company excluded stores that won't be part of its go-forward business, that growth was 3.4%.Bloomingdale's posted the strongest performance of the company's brands, with comparable sales jumping 9% year over year on an owned-plus-licensed basis, including its third-party marketplace. And Bluemercury's comparable sales increased 1.1%.Spring attributed the company's better performance to shoppers responding to changes that Macy's has made to its legacy department stores – such as additional staff ready to help and newer brands like high-end home goods company MacKenzie-Childs.He said he visited Macy's stores, and those of its competitors, on Black Friday and was pleased by what he saw. \"I like the way we're showing up,\" Spring said. \"We look crisp. We look clean. We look interesting, compelling, inspiring, easy to shop.\"The snap to cooler weather helped, too, he said. As temperatures dropped in October, shoppers bought items including cashmere sweaters, outerwear and boots. For the holiday season, Spring said he expects promotions to be at similar levels to the year-ago period at Macy's stores and website, along with those of its competitors.Higher tariffs, however, will mean higher prices for some items. Macy's has worked with vendors and manufacturers to blunt the impact of the duties, and the hit to margins in the third quarter came in lower than the company expected, he said. Still, Spring said Macy's has made \"selective\" price increases in almost every category, with some items costing more because of improved quality or an added embellishment and some simply due to higher import costs.As of Wednesday's close, Macy's shares have risen nearly 33% so far this year. That outpaces the S&P 500's more than 16% gains during the same period. Macy's stock closed Wednesday at $22.46, bringing the company's market cap to about $6.03 billion.",

They also received records from JPMorgan Chase and Deutsche Bank related to Epstein, the wealthy and well-connected financier who killed himself in jail in 2019 while facing federal sex trafficking charges.Photo released by the House Oversight Committee Democrats shows a room inside Jeffrey Epstein's private island home on Little St. James.Source: House Oversight DemocratsThe Democrats said they plan to publicly release the banks' materials \"in the days ahead\" after a review.A spokesperson for Oversight's Republican majority said in a statement that the committee \"has received approximately 5,000 documents in response to [GOP Chairman James Comer of Kentucky's] subpoenas\" to the two banks, along with his request to the Virgin Islands.\"The Majority is reviewing these materials and will make them public soon, just as the Committee has already done with the more than 65,000 pages produced during this investigation,\" the spokesperson said.Photo released by the House Oversight Committee Democrats shows a room inside Jeffrey Epstein's private island home on Little St. James.Source: House Oversight DemocratsThe developments come two weeks after President Donald Trump, a former friend of Epstein's, signed a bipartisan bill ordering the Department of Justice to release files from its investigations into the registered sex offender.Trump's signature started a 30-day timer for Attorney General Pam Bondi to publicly release unclassified files relating to Epstein and his convicted accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell.On Wednesday, a bipartisan group of five lawmakers asked Bondi for a briefing and status update on DOJ's efforts to gather those files in advance of the upcoming deadline, NBC News reported.Oversight ranking Rep. Robert Garcia, D-Calif., separately urged the president to release all of the government's Epstein files immediately.Photo released by the House Oversight Committee Democrats shows a room inside Jeffrey Epstein's private island home on Little St. James.

She was interviewed in July by top DOJ official Todd Blanche, during which time she said she did not know of any wrongdoing by Trump.About a week later, Maxwell was moved to a minimum-security women's prison in Texas.In a letter filed Wednesday in Manhattan federal court, Maxwell said through her attorney that she intends to file a petition seeking her release from prison, NBC and The New York Times reported.Read more CNBC politics coverageJudge dismisses James Comey and Letitia James cases over 'unlawful' prosecutor appointmentSen.

    "body": "watch nowNvidia CEO Jensen Huang said he met with President Donald Trump on Wednesday and that the two men  discussed chip export restrictions, as lawmakers consider a proposal to limit exports of advanced artificial intelligence chips to nations like China. \"I've said it repeatedly that we support export controls, and that we should ensure that American companies have the best and the most and first,\" Huang told reporters on Capitol Hill. Lawmakers were considering including the Guaranteeing Access and Innovation for National Artificial Intelligence Act in a major defense package, known as the National Defense Authorization Act. The GAIN AI Act would require chipmakers like Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices to give U.S. companies first pick on their AI chips before selling them in countries like China. The proposal isn't expected to be part of the NDAA, Bloomberg reported, citing a person familiar with the matter. Huang said it was \"wise\" that the proposal is being left out of the annual defense policy bill. \"The GAIN AI Act is even more detrimental to the United States than the AI Diffusion Act,\" Huang said.  Nvidia's CEO also criticized the idea of establishing a patchwork of state laws regulating AI. The notion of state-by-state regulation has generated pushback from tech companies and spurred the creation of a super PAC called \"Leading the Future,\" which is backed by the AI industry. \"State-by-state AI regulation would drag this industry into a halt and it would create a national security concern, as we need to make sure that the United States advances AI technology as quickly as possible,\" Huang said. \"A federal AI regulation is the wisest.\"Trump last month urged legislators to include a provision in the NDAA that would preempt state AI laws in favor of \"one federal standard.\"But House Majority Leader Steve Scalise (R-LA) told CNBC's Emily Wilkins on Tuesday the provision won't make it into the bill, citing a lack of sufficient support. He and other lawmakers will continue to look for ways to establish a national standard on AI, Scalise added. WATCH: Nvidia currying favor to be able to sell chips in Chinawatch now",

    "body": "watch nowArtificial intelligence has created a device that turns moon dust into energy.The moon vacuum, which was unveiled on Wednesday by Blue Origin at Amazon's re:Invent 2025 conference in Las Vegas, was built using critical technology from startup Istari Digital.\"So what it does is sucks up moon dust and it extracts the heat from it so it can be used as an energy source, like turning moon dust into a battery,\" Istari CEO Will Roper told CNBC's Morgan Brennan.Spacecraft carrying out missions on the lunar surface are typically constrained by lunar night, the two-week period every 28 days during which the moon is cast in darkness and temperatures experience extreme drops, crippling hardware and rendering it useless unless a strong, long-lasting power source is present.\"Kind of like vacuuming at home, but creating your own electricity while you do it,\" he added.The battery was completely designed by AI, said Roper, who was assistant secretary of the Air Force under President Donald Trump's first term and is known for transforming the acquisition process at both the Air Force and, at the time, the newly created Space Force.Read more CNBC tech newsFormer cyber spy raises $60 million to fight AI threatsYouTube's new AI deepfake tracking tool is alarming experts and creatorsApple names former Microsoft, Google exec to succeed retiring AI chiefInstagram orders employees back to the office 5 days a weekA major part of the breakthrough in Istari's technology is the way in which it handles and limits AI hallucinations.Roper said the platform takes all the requirements a part needs and creates guardrails or a \"fence around the playground\" that the AI can't leave while coming up with designs.\"Within that playground, AI can generate to its heart's content,\" he said.\"In the case of Blue Origin's moon battery, [it] doesn't tell you the design was a good one, but it tells us that all of the requirements were met, the standards were met, things like that that you got to check before you go operational,\" he added.Istari is backed by former Google CEO Eric Schmidt and already works with the U.S. government, including as a prime contractor with Lockheed Martin on the experimental x-56A unmanned aircraft.Watch the full interview above and go deeper into the business of the stars with the Manifest Space podcast.watch now",

    "body": "watch nowCommerce Secretary Howard Lutnick on Wednesday denied that the Trump administration's tariff policies were to blame after a new report showed a surprise drop in private payrolls in November.Instead, Lutnick argued on CNBC's \"Squawk on the Street\" that the government shutdown temporarily slowed small-business activity. He added that the federal efforts to enact mass deportations of undocumented immigrants also suppressed jobs numbers.\"No, no, it's not tariffs,\" Lutnick said when asked whether President Donald Trump's import duties explained Wednesday morning's report from ADP, which revealed an unexpected 32,000-worker drop in the labor market.That decline, a sharp turnabout from October, was led by businesses with fewer than 50 workers, which saw their payroll numbers sink by 120,000. Larger businesses, meanwhile, reported a net gain of 90,000 workers.\"Remember, you had the Democratic shutdown, right? And what do you think happens to small business? The people who do business with the U.S. government, they know they're not getting paid, so they sort of slow down their projects,\" Lutnick said. \"So you saw a little bit, even, of construction small business down. So the Democratic shutdown hurt the numbers,\" he said. \"And then, remember, as you deport people, that's going to suppress private job numbers of small businesses,\" Lutnick added.Read more CNBC politics coverageJudge dismisses James Comey and Letitia James cases over 'unlawful' prosecutor appointmentSen.

Lutnick's defense of Trump's protectionist agenda came as corporate executives and economic forecasters have started to warn that his alternately aggressive and unpredictable tariffs could spur domestic job cuts in the coming year.\"Hiring has been choppy of late as employers weather cautious consumers and an uncertain macroeconomic environment,\" ADP's chief economist, Nela Richardson, said in a press release accompanying the private payrolls report.\"And while November's slowdown was broad-based, it was led by a pullback among small businesses,\" Richardson said.",

    "body": "Homes near a data center in Ashburn, Virginia, US, on Friday, July 25, 2025. Bloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesData centers that haven't been built yet are driving up electricity prices and could leave consumers on the hook for expensive power infrastructure if demand projections are wrong.The race to build facilities that provide artificial intelligence has fueled a boom in data centers that train and run large language models, like OpenAI's ChatGPT and Anthropic's Claude. The boom has upended a utility industry that grew used to 20 years of no increase in electricity demand. But now, some investors and energy market analysts are questioning whether the AI race has turned into a bubble, one that would prove expensive to unravel as new transmission lines and power plants are built to support those data centers.Consumers served by the largest electric grid in the U.S. will pay $16.6 billion to secure future power supplies just to meet demand from data centers from 2025 through 2027, according to a watchdog report published this month. The grid is PJM Interconnection, serving more than 65 million people across 13 states, including the world's largest data center hub in Virginia and fast-growing markets like northern Illinois and Ohio. About 90% of that bill, or $15 billion, is to pay for future data center demand, according to Monitoring Analytics, PJM's independent market monitor. This amounts to a \"massive wealth transfer\" from consumers to the data center industry, the watchdog told PJM in a Nov. 10 letter.  watch now\"A lot of us are very concerned that we are paying money today for a data center tomorrow,\" said Abe Silverman, general counsel for the public utility board in New Jersey, one of the states served by PJM, from 2019 until 2023. \"That's a little bit scary if you don't really have faith in the load forecast.\"Residential electricity prices in September rose 20% in Illinois, 12% in Ohio, and 9% in Virginia compared to the same period last year, according to data from the federal Energy Information Administration. Each of those states are among the top five markets for data centers in the U.S. The costs associated with securing power for data centers is directly reflected in consumer's utility bills, said Joe Bowring, president of Monitoring Analytics. \"When the wholesale power costs go up, people pay more, when it goes down people pay less,\" he said. Forecast uncertaintyPJM is forecasting 30 gigawatts of extra demand from data centers through 2030, but it's unclear how much will actually materialize in the end. That's the equivalent of the average annual power consumption of more than 24 million homes in the U.S. Data center developers are shopping projects around in different locations before committing to a site, so there is likely duplication in the forecasts, said Cathy Kunkel, a consultant at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA). watch now\"We're in a bit of a bubble,\" Silverman, the New Jersey official, said. \"There is no question that data center developers are coming out of the woodwork, putting in massive numbers of new requests. It's impossible to say exactly how many of them are speculative versus real.\" Independent power producers such as Constellation Energy, the biggest owner of nuclear plants in the U.S., and Vistra Corp. warned earlier this year that data center demand forecasts are likely inflated. \"I just have to tell you, folks, I think the load is being overstated. We need to pump the brakes here,\" Constellation CEO Joe Dominguez said on the company's earnings call in May. Meanwhile, Vistra CEO James Burke also said in May that data center demand could be overstated by three to five times in some jurisdictions as developers scout their projects around the country. 'Stranded cost'The risk is that utilities invest in expensive infrastructure to meet data center demand, but not all those facilities are eventually built or they end up using less electricity than expected, said Kunkel, the consultant.  \"It does tend to be consumers — residential, commercial, and other industrial ratepayers — that end up paying for overbuilt electrical infrastructure,\" Kunkel said. The potential problem will come if capacity is built that isn't needed, that \"would tend to leave ratepayers holding the stranded cost bag.\" Data center demand forecasts have declined when utilities implement stricter rules. The utility AEP Ohio, for example, recently had requests for 30 gigawatts of electric connections from data centers. AEP Ohio proposed stricter rules \"to mitigate the risk that transmission infrastructure will be built for speculative data center projects,\" according to a filing with the state utility commission in May 2024.   watch nowThe AEP Ohio rules require data centers to pay for 85% of the energy they claim to need, even if they actually use less, to cover infrastructure costs. It also implemented an exit fee if data centers cancel their project or can't meet the terms of their contract.  AEP Ohio's data center requests dropped by more than half, to 13 gigawatts after the utility commission approved the rules last July. \"When faced with potential financial commitments, the most speculative or uncertain data center projects did not submit load study requests — as was intended,\"  the Columbus, Ohio-based utility said in a statement. The number of requests might decline further as the new rules force data centers to make binding contracts, it said. The Data Center Coalition, a lobbying group for big tech companies, and other industry advocates have opposed AEP's stricter rules as \"discriminatory.\" Meeting demandThere is also a risk that the electrical grid grows less reliable as many large data center projects move forward. The 13 gigawatts of data center requests that AEP views as a more accurate figure, for example, is equivalent to about a dozen large nuclear plants. The infrastructure, in power plants and transmission lines, required to meet that demand is immense, the utility said.The solution is for PJM to reject data centers' requests for grid connection if there is not enough power to supply them, Bowring of Monitoring Analytics said. Data centers can either wait until there is enough power to supply them, or they can bring their own generation with them and jump the line, he said. Monitoring Analytics filed a complaint with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission last week calling on PJM to adopt this approach.  \"That will give data centers a clear incentive to bring their [own] generation,\" Bowring said. That formula would also help clear up uncertainty over demand forecasts because data centers are unlikely to pay for infrastructure if they are not serious, he said. Otherwise, the costs that consumers are bearing from data center demand will continue to grow, the watchdog warned FERC in its complaint. ",

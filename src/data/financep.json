    "description": "When Yeli Heidecker and her husband, Benjamin, both 32, decided they were going to downsize to a barndominium — a building designed to look like a bar",
    "body": "When Yeli Heidecker and her husband, Benjamin, both 32, decided they were going to downsize to a barndominium — a building designed to look like a barn, but with a traditional living space inside — they started looking for the perfect lot. In early 2024, the couple purchased a two-acre lot in west-central Texas for $45,000 and began construction on the barndominium. Around the same time, they convinced Yeli's mom, Liliana Villanueva, to move down and live in an RV on the property. Yeli says Villanueva was experiencing some health issues at the time. And because she is a stay-at-home mom and content creator, Yeli says it would be easy to be around to help her mom. Plus, the idea of having her kids' grandmother close by sounded amazing, she adds. The couple was able to build Yeli's mom a tiny home for under $32,000.Yeli HeideckerBut shortly after the couple moved into the barndominium in late 2025, they began considering a more permanent living arrangement for Villanueva, Yeli says.\"We were afraid she was gonna trip and fall and hurt herself or something. We had the bright idea to do a tiny barndo like ours, but we'll do it ourselves,\" Yeli tells CNBC Make It. Going the DIY routeBefore taking the DIY route, the Heideckers obtained quotes for a small barndominium measuring about 400 square feet. The quotes ranged from $63,000 to $93,000, so they decided the best option was to do it themselves and stick to a $30,000 budget.  On top of that, Yeli and Benjamin decided to surprise Villanueva by building the tiny home while she was in Mexico visiting family for six weeks. \"I'm not going to sugarcoat it, it was chaotic,\" Yeli says. \"It was definitely hard, but at the same time, it was so incredibly fulfilling and amazing to see all the work we did.\"The couple hired contractors to handle the shell, electrical work and concrete flooring for the barndominium. The rest of the work, including installing the kitchen, painting the house and putting up the walls and drywall, was done mostly by Benjamin, Yeli says, but she helped out when she wasn't taking care of their four young children.\"It was special because we built this for Abuela,\" Yeli says, using the word for grandmother in Spanish. \"It was emotional seeing it finished because of all the memories of my husband and I working on it. It feels like it bonded us on a deeper level.\"The bedroom is big enough to fit a queen-sized bed.Yeli HeideckerWhen Villanueva returned to Texas in November 2025, she moved into the tiny home even though it wasn't fully finished. \"It was the most beautiful surprise I could have found after getting back from my trip. I am very happy with it,\" Villanueva tells CNBC Make It. \"I laugh because the house is small, but I have absolutely everything I need. It's perfect. I love that I'm close to my daughter and my grandchildren. I feel protected and feel safe.\"\"As immigrants, when you come here, you're fighting the American Dream, and while she's never owned a home on paper, just seeing her have that for herself was very emotional,\" Yeli adds. Inside the tiny homeThe one-bedroom, one-bathroom tiny home fits a washer and dryer as well as a full-size oven, stove and refrigerator. The Heideckers created the layout of the home with Villanueva's specific needs in mind.The tiny home has a washer and dryer, and a full-size stove, oven and refrigerator.Yeli HeideckerAs of January, the only remaining task is tiling the bathroom, which Yeli says will happen soon. Here's a breakdown of the major expenses for the tiny home, according to documents reviewed by CNBC Make It. All expenses are rounded.Trim: $250Paint: $350Flooring: $600AC mini split: $750Cabinets: $1,300Plumbing: $1,500Drywall and lumber: $1,700Electricity: $1,775Appliances: $2,000Insulation: $2,100Miscellaneous: $6,500Barn shell: $12,500In total, the home cost $31,325, including a number of miscellaneous expenses, such as power tools, countertops, lighting and faucets.Because the tiny home is on the same property as the Heideckers', it doesn't have separate utility bills. Instead, the couple covers all monthly expenses, such as water, electricity and gas, while Villanueva pays about $100 a month for cable TV. Villanueva says she loves that the tiny home has everything she needs.Yeli HeideckerSince Villanueva moved in, Yeli says the only thing the couple regrets is not making the tiny home a little bigger, specifically in the bedroom. But for the mother and daughter, the best part is being able to live next to each other. \"It's nice to see my kids being able to have Grandma just there, especially after we lived away from family for a very long time,\" Yeli says. Although the tiny home isn't officially finished, Yeli and Villanueva say the barndominium and tiny home are their forever homes, respectively. \"I'm doing very well here and have no plans on ever leaving,\" Villanueva says. \"I have it very good here and get to enjoy it alongside my family.\"The couple built the tiny home to look like a mini version of their house.Yeli HeideckDespite how chaotic the process was for the couple to get the tiny house done in such a short amount of time, Yeli says she would do it all over again — and recommends it to others, too. \"It's definitely worth it if you have aging parents, but even if you don't have an aging parent, having a special unit for someone, or when you have family coming over, or something like that, it's nice,\" Yeli says.

    "body": "watch nowPalantir climbed 7% on Tuesday after beating Wall Street's fourth-quarter estimates amid rising spending on artificial intelligence tools from governments and businesses. The shares popped after it reported $1.41 billion in revenue, ahead of LSEG estimates of $1.33 billion. The company posted adjusted earnings per share of 25 cents, beating the 23 cents a share expected by LSEG. The earnings came after a muted end to 2025 — November was Palantir's worst month in two years amid a broader decline in software stocks over fears of an AI valuation bubble. The stock ultimately rose 135% in 2025 but, at Monday's close, was down 17% year to date.CEO Alex Karp told CNBC's Morgan Brennan Monday that the earnings were \"the best results that I'm aware of in tech in the last decade.\"Stock Chart IconStock chart iconPalantir stock over the past yearPalantir creates software and data tools for businesses and government agencies like the Department of Defense, the Internal Revenue Service and the Department of Homeland Security. Karp noted that the adoption of its tools by the U.S. government saw 66% year-over-year revenue growth.Palantir signed a software contract worth up to $10 billion with the U.S. Army in July, and a $448 million deal with the U.S. Navy in December to accelerate shipbuilding production.\"Although Palantir's valuation is still frothy, it appears more reasonable relative to recent venture rounds for companies tied to the AI ecosystem,\" said Louie DiPalma, analyst at William Blair, in a note on Monday ahead of the earnings. DiPalma said the firm expected Palantir's operating margin to rise from 50% to 65% over the next five years as it increased government and defense contracts.The company has seen its work with the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement come under scrutiny in recent weeks, after federal agents shot two protesters in Minneapolis.Read more CNBC tech newsIn Google earnings, analysts want answers on Apple's Siri-Gemini dealNintendo Switch becomes the gaming giant's best-selling console everWaymo announces $16 billion funding roundOracle's credit default swaps are plummeting as financing plan boosts investor confidence",

    "body": "watch nowThe House of Representatives on Tuesday narrowly passed a bill to end the three-day partial shutdown of much of the U.S. government, virtually guaranteeing the end of the closure.The vote was 217-214 and sends the bill to President Donald Trump, who has said he will sign it immediately. Much of the government has been shuttered since Saturday morning. The bill provides funding for the departments of Defense, Treasury, State, Health and Human Services, Labor, Housing and Urban Development, Transportation, and Education through the remainder of the fiscal year on Sept. 30. It also provides two weeks of stopgap funding for the Department of Homeland Security after the Senate stripped full-year funding for the agency in response to the killings of two U.S. citizens by federal immigration officers. Now, Congress will turn to thorny negotiations over new guardrails on immigration enforcement in the DHS funding bill. The vote was bipartisan, with the lead Democratic negotiator on the spending bills, Rep. Rosa DeLauro of Connecticut, urging Democrats to support it, while a number of hard-line Republicans opposed it.\"Passing these five full-year funding bills today puts us in the best position to win that fight\" over DHS funding, DeLauro said. Many Democrats and some Republicans still opposed the bill, however.The appropriations package was nearly torpedoed earlier in the day during a procedural vote, but narrowly advanced 217-215.House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., kept the House open much longer than expected to clear the procedural vote, where he could only afford to lose one Republican. More than a handful of Republicans held out their votes, and Rep. John Rose, R-Tenn., initially voted against moving ahead before changing his vote to support it. All Democrats voted no on the procedural vote. Many Republicans wanted to compel a Senate vote on a controversial voter ID measure known as the SAVE Act. That caused a mad scramble on the House floor from the Republican leadership team to get the holdouts to vote yes and to flip Rose. Rose eventually changed his vote, unlocking the House's ability to move forward on the bill.Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York had told Johnson that Democrats would not help Republicans advance the procedure under which the government funding vote would happen, requiring Johnson to work within his own razor-thin majority to fund the government. After a new Democratic lawmaker was sworn in Monday, Johnson could only afford to lose one Republican vote on any party-line measure.\"We're going to pass the rule today, it was never in doubt to me,\" Johnson said in a news conference Tuesday morning. \"We're governing responsibly and we're getting the job done.\"Read more CNBC politics coverageHouse hardliners complicate ending government shutdown as Speaker Johnson moves aheadTrump says U.S. and India reached trade deal, will lower tariffs immediatelyUnited Arab Emirates' 'Spy Sheikh' bought secret stake in Trump crypto company: WSJEpstein files: Ro Khanna says DOJ's latest release is 'not good enough'Speaker Johnson: 'Confident' government shutdown will end by TuesdayJohnson spent most of Monday trying to work through rebellions in his party against ending the shutdown.

    "body": "Matteo Della Torre | Nurphoto | Getty ImagesAlphabet reports earnings Wednesday, and investors will be looking for more details on the company's deal with Apple to revamp the Siri virtual assistant with Google's Gemini artificial intelligence technology.While Wall Street is expecting Google to report a 15% year-over-year increase in its fourth-quarter revenue, much of the attention during the company's earnings call will be on any new details about the Siri-Gemini deal, analysts told CNBC. The earnings on Wednesday will be the first time Alphabet's leadership address shareholders since Apple in January announced that it had chosen Gemini as the AI technology to power the company's Siri overhaul this year. The deal represents one of the most prominent yet for Gemini, and the scale of Apple's user base — 2.5 billion active devices — is important for Google, even if the search giant doesn't get specific user data, analysts said.\"They'll have critical mass, and even if they're not going to get consumer information, maybe they'll be able to see what queries are being asked, which could help Google train its AI models,\" said Gil Luria, managing director at technology research firm D.A. Davidson.However, there are still many unanswered questions about what the partnership entails.What the companies have said is that the multiyear partnership will lean on Google's Gemini and cloud technology for future Apple foundational models. A joint statement from the companies said Apple had \"determined that Google's AI technology provides the most capable foundation for Apple Foundation Models,\" adding that the company was \"excited about the innovative new experiences\" that Gemini \"will unlock for Apple users.\"The companies said the Apple Intelligence suite of features will continue to run on Apple devices and the iPhone maker's private cloud. Apple intelligence includes Siri as well as Apple's AI writing tools and Genmoji, the company's emoji creation feature.Apple CEO Tim Cook discussed the partnership with CNBC's Steve Kovach last week when the company reported its latest quarterly earnings. Cook said the Gemini-powered Siri will be personalized for users, but he added that it won't know users' \"Gmail and stuff like that.\"Cook added that Siri will \"know a lot\" and said Apple plans to share more details when the updated Siri is released.Google CEO Sundar Pichai, left, and Apple CEO Tim Cook listen as then-President Joe Biden speaks during a roundtable with American and Indian business leaders in the East Room of the White House, June 23, 2023.Anna Moneymaker | Getty ImagesThe companies have not shared much else, but Bloomberg reported in November that Apple is planning to pay Google about $1 billion a year for the arrangement, though the companies have yet to confirm the deal's terms. Apple and Google are no strangers to working together. Google has been the default search engine for Apple devices since before the iPhone was released in 2007, and the search company is estimated to pay the iPhone maker about $20 billion a year for that prominent placement. That arrangement briefly came into question after Google was found to hold an illegal internet search monopoly in 2024, but the federal judge ultimately allowed the deal to continue. \"The Google-Apple relationship from search was instrumental for both companies, as we're seeing with this deal,\" Luria said.A Gemini-powered version of Siri will come as soon as February, according to a January Bloomberg report, which also said that Apple will be leaning on Google's infrastructure for AI features later this year. That would represent a departure for Apple, which runs its features on its encrypted cloud infrastructure. The move would be valuable for Google, which would likely get access to more user data, analysts said.\"We're bringing intelligence to more of what people love, and we're integrating it across the operating system in a personal and private way,\" Cook told analysts last week. If Apple does use Google's compute infrastructure broadly for its AI overhaul, that would represent an even bigger win for the search company, analysts said. It also poses the question of how much Google plans to scale its chip business, said Michael Nathanson, co-founder of equity research firm Moffett Nathanson.\"Apple using its silicon would give it more scale,\" Nathanson said of Google's Ironwood tensor processing units, which have gained notable customers, including Meta and Anthropic. Google reports revenue from its silicon services through its cloud unit.The Apple deal \"underscores Google's core AI advantages led by Gemini, its growing compute infrastructure and hardware,\" wrote Citi research analysts in a recent note.Analysts said Apple choosing Google over OpenAI and other AI startups is a defensive win for the search giant. Apple is currently partnered with OpenAI for an integration of the AI startup's ChatGPT with Siri and Apple Intelligence. As part of that arrangement, Siri hands off complicated queries to ChatGPT. It's unclear what the Google partnership means for the ChatGPT integration.\"There was a real concern on Wall Street that Apple would run into the arms of OpenAI or Perplexity,\" Nathanson said. \"That's not really gonna happen now.\"WATCH: Google DeepMind CEO on state of the AI race, push towards AGI and AI impact on jobswatch now",

Kevin Carter | Getty ImagesThe U.S. military on Tuesday shot down an Iranian drone that flew toward the USS Abraham Lincoln in the Arabian Sea.The incident occurred as tensions in the Middle East are high with President Donald Trump weighing potential military strikes against the Islamic Republic.   The Shahed-139 drone \"aggressively approached\" the aircraft carrier with \"unclear intent,\" U.S. Central Command spokesman Capt. Tim Hawkins told CNBC in a statement.The Abraham Lincoln was about 500 miles from Iran's southern coast when the unmanned aircraft \"unnecessarily maneuvered\" toward the ship, Hawkins said. U.S. forces were operating in international waters and took de-escalatory measures, but the drone continued to fly toward the aircraft carrier, he said. An F-35 warplane from the Abraham Lincoln shot down the drone \"in self defense to protect the aircraft carrier and personnel on board,\" Hawkins said. No U.S. personnel were harmed and no U.S. equipment was damaged, he said. U.S. crude oil prices were up more than 1% at 2:32 p.m. ET. Hours after the drone was shot down, Iranian forces harassed a U.S. flagged and crewed merchant vessel that was lawfully transiting the Strait of Hormuz, Hawkins said. The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps forces threatened to board and seize the M/V Stena Imperative, he said.A U.S. guided missile destroyer intervened, de-escalated the situation and the merchant vessel is now proceeding safely, Hawkins said.Trump has deployed the Abraham Lincoln to the Middle East as he threatens Iran with strikes if it does not negotiate a deal over its nuclear program. The president threatened to hit the Islamic Republic during mass demonstrations against the regime last month but ultimately held back from strikes. The incidents Tuesday come as Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff is scheduled to have discussions with Iranian officials later this week. Those conversations are still scheduled to take place, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told Fox News in an interview. \"As for the president, he remains committed to always pursuing diplomacy first,\" Leavitt said. \"But in order for diplomacy to work of course it takes two to tango. You need a willing partner to engage.\" Leavitt said Trump \"always has a range of options on the table and that includes the use of military force.\" ",

The analysts cut their price target on shares to 530 Danish kroner ($84) from 850 kroner. \"We doubt a switch to silver-plating or stainless steel will act as a panacea given the added complexity of manufacturing and the potential deterioration of customer offer these imply,\" they added. On Friday, silver had its worst day since 1980 after President Donald Trump announced Kevin Warsh was his nominee to be the next Chair of the Federal Reserve, easing fears about the central bank's independence that had been fueling a drive into safe-haven assets like metals.While rising input costs are squeezing Pandora's margins from one side, a deteriorating macroeconomic backdrop is hitting it from the other. The company's core demographic, lower-income consumers, is struggling to cope with rising costs in what's been dubbed the \"K-shaped economy.\"To combat rising input costs, Pandora raised prices by about 14%, which damaged consumer engagement, Jefferies said.Citi analysts in January also downgraded Pandora shares to Neutral, citing slowing sales momentum and extreme silver inflation.\"Near-term visibility has diminished considerably, worsened by a volatile macro environment in the US and Europe (~80% of sales) and potential brand and jewellery consumption fatigue,\" they said. Pandora is slated to report full-year results on Thursday.",

One version of the plan sees investors renting the homes out to tenants, with a portion of monthly payments counting toward a future down payment should they choose to buy after three years.Amid elevated interest rates and prices, housing affordability has emerged as a key issue for President Donald Trump. Earlier this month, Trump said that the U.S. should ban large institutional investors from buying single-family homes, arguing that corporate ownership has only exacerbated the housing affordability crisis. The president has also repeatedly said he wants to help first-time buyers, but without triggering a broad decline in existing home prices.\"I don't want to drive housing prices down. I want to drive housing prices up for people who own homes,\" he said at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.The proposal, dubbed \"Trump Homes\" by industry players, could ultimately involve as many as one million homes, Bloomberg reported. A White House official told the outlet that the administration is not actively considering the plan.After a rough year last year, Lennar shares are off to a good start for 2026, up 9%.",

    "body": "Packages of  Pepsi are displayed on a store shelf on Oct. 9, 2025 in San Anselmo, California. Justin Sullivan | Getty ImagesPepsiCo on Tuesday reported quarterly earnings and revenue that topped analysts' expectations, fueled by improving organic sales across its business.Demand for the company's snacks has been sluggish as consumers balk at higher prices. This year, Pepsi plans to lower prices on products like chips from its North American food division to \"improve competitiveness and the purchase frequency of our brands,\" executives said in prepared remarks. Productivity savings will offset the lower prices, they said.Shares of the food and beverage giant rose more than 3% in morning trading.Here's what the company reported compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:Earnings per share: $2.26 adjusted vs. $2.24 expectedRevenue: $29.34 billion vs. $28.97 billion expectedPepsi reported fourth-quarter net income attributable to the company of $2.54 billion, or $1.85 per share, up from $1.52 billion, or $1.11 per share, a year earlier.Excluding restructuring and impairment charges and other items, the company earned $2.26 per share.Net sales rose 5.6% to $29.34 billion. Organic revenue, which strips out foreign currency, acquisitions and divestitures, increased 2.1% in the quarter.\"PepsiCo's fourth quarter results reflected a sequential acceleration in reported and organic revenue growth, with improvements in both the North America and International businesses,\" CEO Ramon Laguarta said in a statement.However, the company is seeing volume declines, particularly for its North American businesses. The metric excludes pricing and foreign exchange fluctuations to reflect demand more accurately. Global volume for its food fell 2% in the quarter, although global volume for its drinks ticked up 1%.Pepsi's home market was once again the weak point of the quarter, although it is showing signs of improvement. Inflation-weary shoppers have been buying less of Pepsi's snacks and drinks in a sign of consumer backlash against higher prices. \"Affordability\" is the biggest obstacle to attracting low- and middle-income consumers, Laguarta said on the company's conference call.PepsiCo Beverages North America, which includes Gatorade, Starry and Poppi, saw volume shrink 4%, though its organic sales rose 2%. PepsiCo's North American food division, which spans brands from Quaker Oats to Cheetos, reported that volume fell 1%. Although it reported higher volume growth than the North American beverage unit this quarter, Pepsi's domestic food business has been the laggard of the portfolio for more than a year.Retailers that sell Pepsi products have responded to the price cuts with enthusiasm, according to executives. As a result, its products will become even more ubiquitous, starting this spring; the company expects a double-digit increase in shelf space with its top retail customers, on average.To further improve demand for its snacks, Pepsi is planning to cut prices on some packages of select brands, including Lay's, Tostito's, Doritos and Cheetos, executives said in prepared remarks. In addition to price cuts, key brands, like Lay's, Tostitos, Gatorade and Quaker have been undergoing makeovers that include simpler ingredients and new packaging to help bring back customers. Pepsi is also working on expanding its portfolio to include more functional drinks, whole grains, protein and fiber.Pepsi also reiterated the outlook for 2026 that the company provided in December. The company is projecting that organic revenue will rise between 2% and 4% and core constant currency earnings per share will increase in a range of 4% to 6%.In December, Pepsi struck a deal with activist investor Elliott Investment Management, which had revealed a roughly $4 billion stake in the company two months earlier. As part of the agreement, Pepsi said it would slash its U.S. product lineup by 20%, cut costs across its food and beverage operations, and lower snack prices. Elliott did not receive any seats on Pepsi's board.As Pepsi implements that plan this year, the company is projecting that its North American business will improve, while its international divisions remain \"resilient,\" according to Laguarta.Programming note: PepsiCo CEO Ramon Laguarta will discuss the company's earnings after 10 a.m. ET.

    "body": "Novo Nordisk signage on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange in New York, US, on Friday, Jan. 2, 2026.Michael Nagle | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesNovo Nordisk's U.S. shares plummeted Tuesday after the company said it sees sales and profit growth declining this year, hit by lower prices in the U.S. and loss of exclusivity for its blockbuster Wegovy and Ozempic in China, Brazil and Canada. Novo's American depositary shares fell as much as 14% in afternoon trading, after a trading halt. The results were published after the closing bell in Copenhagen, where the company has its primary listing, and ahead of the scheduled release early Wednesday.For 2026, the drugmaker sees sales and operating profit both declining between 5% and 13% at constant exchange rates, far worse than analysts had expected.It comes as the Danish drugmaker is fighting to regain its footing in the weight-loss space amid fierce competition.\"In 2026, Novo Nordisk will face pricing headwinds in an increasingly competitive market,\" CEO Mike Doustdar. \"However, we are very encouraged by the promising early uptake from the US launch of Wegovy pill, and we remain confident in our ability to drive volume growth over the coming years.\"The outlook reflects expectations for a sales decline in the U.S., its biggest market, but sales growth ex-U.S. Novo said. \"In 2026, the global GLP-1 market expansion is assumed to continue, enabling Novo Nordisk to increase patient reach and expand volumes,\" the company said in a statement.In 2025, sales increased by 10% and operating profit increased by 6%, in line with the company's latest guidance, which it lowered throughout 2025, citing challenges in the U.S. market.Novo also said that it will roll out Wegovy in more markets in 2026 and expects to introduce the higher 7.2 mg dose in a number of countries.Mounting pressureStock Chart IconStock chart iconNovo Nordisk stock has seen steep declines over the past year.Novo launched the oral version of the blockbuster weight-loss medicine Wegovy in the U.S. early January, and, despite its promising start, the market is closely watching how Novo Nordisk will fare along with U.S. rival Eli Lilly, which is expected to launch its own weight loss pill in the first half of 2026.\"Investors want to see they are making the most of this lead, particularly in the direct to patient (mostly self-pay or cash pay) channel, closing some of the large gap that widened between them and Lilly in this channel in 2025,\" said Morningstar analyst Karen Andersen.Semaglutide, the active ingredient in Wegovy and Ozempic, is losing exclusivity in markets like Canada, Brazil and China in 2026. Together with significant pricing pressure in its largest market, the U.S., analysts had forecast sales growth to moderate this year to single digits after several years of much higher growth.Coming into the print, Barclays analyst James Gordon said the Novo guide was expected to crystalize further downgrades, however could also act as a clearing event given the \"significant investor concern\" about this year's outlook.\"[Guidance] cuts could be at least partly mitigated by investors taking the opportunity to then buy into the Oral Wegovy US launch and Injectable Wegovy potential US volume inflection this year.\"Novo has faced pressure for the past 18 months as rival U.S.-based Eli Lilly's rival weight-loss drug tirzepatide – sold as Mounjaro and Zepbound – resulted in more pronounced weight loss than Novo's medicine, and surpassed Novo in U.S. market share.Ozempic and Wegovy salesNovo and Lilly in November announced a deal with the Trump administration to cut prices for their best-selling drugs, which are expected to increase volumes but ultimately hurt total sales. The agreements involved cutting prices of their GLP-1 drugs for Medicare and Medicaid in 2026 as well as offering them directly to consumers at a discount through the forthcoming TrumpRx.gov website, expected to launch in January.In the fourth quarter, Novo net sales amounted to 79.1 billion Danish kroner ($12.5 billion), slightly ahead of analysts' expectations of 77.8 billion kroner, according to LSEG estimates. Operating profit in the quarter was largely in line with estimates at 31.7 billlion kroner, down 14% year-on-year.Ozempic, its best-selling medicine, brought in 31.8 billion in the quarter, up 1% from the same period last year at constant exchange rates. Wegovy sales were 21.9 billion kroner, up 17%.- CNBC's Annika Kim Constantino contributed to this report",

    "body": "The oil tanker \"Grinch\" (R), suspected of belonging to the Russian's shadow fleet, is seen outside the coast of Martigues near the port of Marseille-Fos on January 25, 2026, as it's surveilled by the French Navy. Thibaud Moritz | Afp | Getty ImagesPresident Donald Trump announced a U.S. trade deal with India on Monday which he said includes a promise from India to stop buying Russian oil and potentially buy from the U.S. and Venezuela, but data shows the shadow fleet of tankers moving sanctioned crude continues to unload at Indian ports.Global data and analytics firm Kpler's vessel tracking shared with CNBC shows four tankers associated with Russia's shadow fleet unloading or in the process of unloading sanctioned oil at Indian ports: the Giannis, unloading Urals at Chennai Refinery; the Nyxora, unloading Urals at Paradip Refinery; the Tiburon, unloading Urals at Vadinar Refinery; and the Seasons I, which is being tracked outside Vadinar on Tuesday morning but was yet to unload, according to Kpler.In recent months, the global shadow fleet moving sanctioned oil, estimated to be as large as 1,400 vessels, has navigated around the tightening U.S. enforcement campaign on Venezuela and Iranian oil, and Europe's interventions against the increasing flow of stateless tankers loading Russian crude. A recent Lloyd's List analysis on the global shadow fleet after the U.S. military actions in Venezuela found that out of the approximately 50 tankers that were full of Venezuelan oil, at least five tankers completed deliveries to China with the vessel's Automatic Identification System (AIS) operating normally, and suggesting \"the enforcement pressure has yet to bite.\" The U.S. recently completed its first sales of Venezuelan oil in the legal crude market.Sanctioned Russian crude has also faced increasing enforcement measures. Recently, the French seized the tanker Grinch, which departed Murmansk earlier this month with a cargo of Russian oil. The French, with British assistance in tracking and monitoring, boarded the vessel to conduct a flag verification. The flag of the Comoros Islands has been deemed false. This seizure was the first instance of the EU-UK plan to interdict Russia's shadow fleet. The sanctioning and seizure of the Russian shadow fleet is one of the efforts to cut Russian energy revenue to reduce Moscow's ability to pursue its war in Ukraine.India's imports of Russian oil have reached a record level this year.\"In 2025, India's oil imports from Russia made up 33% of the country's total seaborne oil imports and 25 percent of Russia's seaborne oil exports,\" said Niels Rasmussen, chief shipping analyst at Bimco. \"A new trade agreement between the U.S. and India could, according to U.S. President Donald Trump, put an end to that trade,\" he said. But Kremlin officials have pushed back, telling reporters they have not officially heard from India about any suspension of oil purchases by the Indian government.India's Prime Minister, Narendra Modi, has also yet to publicly confirm the terms of the trade deal Trump announced, though Indian officials have said an announcement will be coming. Trump's announcement of the trade deal came days after the E.U. and India signed a major trade agreement slashing tariffs to zero on many goods over a number of years.The Trump administration has been pressuring India during the trade war to stop buying Russian oil, and Trump said on Monday India should purchase oil from the U.S. or Venezuela. Even if it does stop importing Russian crude, Rasmussen says it could instead purchase more oil from the Persian Gulf. Before Russia invaded Ukraine on February 24, 2022, up to two-thirds of India's crude oil and oil product imports arrived from the Persian Gulf. In 2025, these crude imports had fallen to 45%, according to Bimco.Rasmussen said he would not expect Russian oil exports to fall by a similar amount as Russia will likely aim to find new buyers, even if it requires a higher rebate to buyers of Russian oil. The shadow fleet often has to sell at a discount, and those discounts may increase as global enforcement measures tighten. Russian crude, because it is sanctioned, already trades at a lower price than crude sold on the public markets.Kevin Book, managing director at ClearView Energy Partners, said if India does close the door on Russian oil, it will give other buyers of last resort more market power. \"That could pressure Russian receipts to the downside. Barrels generally find a buyer. The question is the price,\" he said.But some analysts caution that a smaller market for Russian oil could make it harder for the shadow fleet to find additional employment in its bid to replace India. \"The only major country left to purchase Russian oil is China, and they may already have all the Russian oil that they want,\" said Andy Lipow, president of Lipow Oil Associates.With less crude oil out of Venezuela to feed the dark fleet and the Indian market potentially shut down, Lipow says many of those vessels may be idled or ultimately be scrapped. But Book says the global shadow fleet is fungible, and if there is an opportunity to move sanctioned oil, the owners of these vessels will take advantage of it, with Venezuela an example. \"The shadow fleet moves from one area of demand to another, and as long as sanctions remain in place against other major producing exporters, you can expect that there will still be some shadow vessels being used,\" he said. \"The tankers that were in Venezuelan trade would now go into Iranian and Russian trade.\"The U.S. has announced the seizure of the Bella-1 for violations of U.S. sanctions. The vessel, known as the Marinera after recently reflagging to Russia, was seized in the North Atlantic pursuant to a warrant issued by a U.S. federal court after being tracked by USCGC Munro.Source: @US_EUCOM | U.S. Coast Guard | Via XDespite the sanctioned crude crackdown, Russia has been quickly adding to its shadow fleet, reflagging vessels that once moved Venezuelan oil. In December, 17 sanctioned vessels were reflagged to Russia. One of the tankers seized by the U.S. in the blockade of Venezuelan oil was a recently reflagged Russian vessel.Oil analysts say with the discounted sanctioned oil a separate market from conventional above-board crude oil commerce, all of the enforcement actions and tariffs continue to change the economics of the crude shipments. \"The overall trade between nations matters,\" Book said. \"We are seeing oil flows have shifted locations through sanctions and then shifted again through tariffs. There will be logistical costs associated with these shifts.\" The higher costs come from shipping petroleum longer distances, as well as through intermediaries to circumvent sanctions. A prime example Book gave was the transport of Russian oil, which previously went to Europe, and is now often bound for China.Book explained that economics in the oil refining business, where margins are tight, favor discounted sanctioned oil. \"Discounts are extremely attractive to refiners,\" he said, and that means the barrels of sanctioned oil being moved by the dark fleet \"are going to find a home. As long as there are sanctions in place, sanctions circumvention and workarounds are likely,\" Book added. These workarounds end up being a plus for China, which is the primary buyer of Russian and Iranian crude. \"The more fraught a barrel becomes, the more it generates a profit for its buyer and a discount for its seller. China is probably going to continue looking for distressed discounted barrels,\" Book said.The Marinera oil tanker is seen on January 14, 2026 in Burghead, Scotland. The Marinera oil tanker, previously known as the Bella 1, has entered UK waters at the request of the US to be replenished with \"essential supplies.\" The Russian-flagged tanker was seized by US forces on 7 January 2026, between Iceland and Scotland, for allegedly violating sanctions by transporting oil for Venezuela, Russia, and Iran. Peter Summers | Getty ImagesLloyd's Shadow Fleet Tracker, which covers the roughly 1,400 vessels that predominantly move sanctioned Russian oil, shows there has been an increasing flow of stateless tankers loaded with Russian oil, anchored in the waters of Malaysia. The increase continues despite the government's pledge to shut it down. Malaysia has a trade agreement with the U.S. that restricts dealings with sanctioned entities.Maritime intelligence from Kpler shows that the pressure of the U.S. brokering Venezuelan oil trades, and the existing sanctions on Russia and Iran, are forcing more of these vessels to conduct ship-to-ship transfers as part of their efforts to go dark when moving sanctioned oil. \"It is clear that there are still avid buyers of this sanctioned oil, namely China and India,\" said Jean‑Charles Gordon, vice president of maritime and logistics at Kpler. \"China consumes half of the Iranian oil.\"In 2025, 251 vessels were loaded with sanctioned Iranian oil — 217 of those vessels (86%) are sanctioned, the vessels are targeted by a government identifying them in moving the illicit oil, according to Kpler data. The remaining 34 vessels are in the active shadow fleet, which moves the sanctioned crude through deceptive practices. The majority of these vessels (96%) conducted dark ship-to-ship transfers; 77% spoofed their vessel location; and 72% turned off their vessel location beacons for prolonged stretches of time.In 2025, there were 510 vessels loaded with sanctioned Russian oil, according to Kpler. Among those, 305, or 59% of the fleet, were sanctioned. Another 86 vessels representing roughly 17% of the total fleet would be considered \"shadow fleet.\" These vessels also engaged in spoofing vessel locations and prolonged AIS gaps.\"The dark fleet isn't disappearing, it's becoming more offshore, more fragmented, and more behaviorally extreme,\" Gordon said.watch now",

    "body": "Tulsi Gabbard, director of National Intelligence, during a cabinet meeting at the White House in Washington, DC, US, on Tuesday, Dec. 2, 2025. Yuri Gripas | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesSen. Mark Warner, D-Va., on Tuesday called on Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard to testify in person before the Senate Intelligence Committee about her appearance at an FBI raid on a Georgia election office last week.Warner, the vice chairman of the intelligence panel, said he was especially concerned that Gabbard facilitated a phone call between those FBI agents and President Donald Trump after the search warrant was executed.\"Let's be clear: It is inappropriate for a sitting president to personally involve himself in a criminal investigation tied to an election he lost,\" Warner told reporters on Capitol Hill.The senator also sounded alarms about Trump's recent suggestion that Republicans should \"take over\" and \"nationalize\" elections.\"That statement alone makes clear that this threat to our election security, the basic premise of our democracy, is forward looking to 2026 into 2028,\" he said.Warner's comments turn up the volume on Democrats' growing fears that Trump — who vehemently refused to accept his 2020 election loss, and continues to falsely claim that he won that race — may try to meddle in the upcoming midterms.Even as the minority party, Democrats in the Senate have the power to compel people to testify.United States Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard speaks on the phone while standing at the edge of a truck loading bay after the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) executed a search warrant for the Fulton County Election Hub and Operation Center in relation to the 2020 election, according to a law enforcement official familiar with the matter, in Union City, Georgia, U.S. January 28, 2026.Elijah Nouvelage | ReutersWarner accused Gabbard's office of systematically \"dismantling\" various guardrails designed to protect elections.\"When you put all of this together, it is clear that what happened in Fulton County is not about revisiting the past, it is about shaping the outcome of future elections,\" he said.The Office of the Director of National Intelligence did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment on Warner's remarks.In a letter to Warner and other lawmakers on Monday, Gabbard said her presence at the Fulton County election office was \"requested\" by Trump and that she only observed the execution of an FBI search warrant there \"for a brief period of time.\"Spokespeople for the county have confirmed that the federal agents were seeking records related to 2020 elections. Fulton County Superior Court Clerk Che Alexander told local outlet WSB-TV last week, \"They took 24 pallets, which encompassed 656 boxes of 2020 election documents.\"Gabbard said in the letter that, as DNI, she has \"broad statutory authority to coordinate, integrate, and analyze intelligence related to election security, including counterintelligence (CI), foreign and other malign influence and cybersecurity.\"Gabbard also appeared to broadly confirm The New York Times' report that, during a meeting with FBI agents after the raid, she called up Trump and put him on speakerphone to praise them for their work.\"While visiting the FBI Field Office in Atlanta, I thanked the FBI agents for their professionalism and great work, and facilitated a brief phone call for the President to thank the agents personally for their work,\" Gabbard wrote in the letter.The Times, citing three people with knowledge of the meeting, reported that Trump asked the agents questions, which were mostly fielded by the squad supervisor who developed evidence for the search of the election office.Read more CNBC politics coverageHouse hardliners complicate ending government shutdown as Speaker Johnson moves aheadTrump says U.S. and India reached trade deal, will lower tariffs immediatelyUnited Arab Emirates' 'Spy Sheikh' bought secret stake in Trump crypto company: WSJEpstein files: Ro Khanna says DOJ's latest release is 'not good enough'Speaker Johnson: 'Confident' government shutdown will end by TuesdayGabbard's letter said Trump \"did not ask any questions, nor did he or I issue any directives\" on the call.She added that her office's general counsel \"has found my actions to be consistent and well within my statutory authorities.\"Warner rejected that defense. \"The broad authority to analyze intelligence is not a license to participate in a sham investigation,\" he said. \"And it certainly does not justify facilitating direct contact between the frontline FBI agents doing this investigation, directly to the president of the United States.\"Meanwhile, Trump, in a podcast interview with former deputy FBI director Dan Bongino that was released Monday, called on members of the Republican Party to \"take over the voting.\" He made that suggestion after echoing the conspiracy theory that noncitizens are being \"brought\" into the U.S. to vote illegally. Trump tied the claim — which has been repeatedly debunked — with his administration's aggressive efforts to carry out mass deportations of undocumented immigrants.\"If we don't get them out, Republicans will never win another election,\" Trump told Bongino.It's \"amazing that the Republicans aren't tougher on it. The Republicans should say, 'We want to take over. We should take over the voting, the voting in at least many — 15 places,'\" Trump said.\"The Republicans ought to nationalize the voting,\" he went on. \"We have states that are so crooked, and they're counting votes. We have states that I won that show I didn't win.\"States are primarily responsible for governing their own election systems.\"You're going to see something in Georgia, where they were able to get, with the court order and the ballots,\" Trump added in the interview. \"You're going to see some interesting things come out.\"",

    "body": "watch nowRocket Companies shares jumped on Tuesday after CEO Varun Krishna told CNBC the company was writing a larger amount of mortgage loans.\"We're getting ready for our earnings call here in just a couple of weeks, and I will share with this group that we're on track to produce the highest mortgage loan production in terms of volume that we've had in four years, and the highest gain on sale that we've had in four years as well,\" Krishna said on CNBC's \"Squawk Box.\"Rocket shares were last up about 6.3%, jumping as Krishna shared the news. Rocket reports on February 19.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconRocket Cos., 1 dayThe rate on a 30-year mortgage dropped 22 basis points to 5.99% last month, matching the low from Feb. 2, 2023, according to Mortgage News Daily. The decline came after President Donald Trump said on social media that he is instructing mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to buy $200 billion in mortgage bonds.Rocket's advantage stems from its ability to retain customers by tightly linking mortgage servicing and origination, the CEO said. Rocket keeps relationships intact through its servicing platform, allowing it to recapture borrowers when they return to the market for a home purchase or cash out refinance, he added.\"When they're ready for their next purchase, when they're ready for a cash out refinance, Rocket is there with a great experience, powered by AI. And because of that, we're able to retain our clients, whereas other players simply lose the asset,\" he said. Krishna said Rocket is optimistic about the broader housing outlook. Industry forecasts point to mortgage market growth of as much as 25% through 2026, while existing home sales could rise by up to 10% as affordability improves and pent-up demand returns, he noted. ",

    "body": "Walmart associates celebrate during the opening bell ceremony at the Nasdaq Market to celebrate the company’s listing transfer, in New York City, U.S., December 9, 2025.Brendan McDermid | ReutersWalmart crossed the $1 trillion market cap threshold on Tuesday after a dizzying stock climb fueled by the growth of digital businesses and the acquisition of new customers. In hitting the benchmark, the largest U.S. retailer and grocer joins an exclusive club made up almost entirely of technology companies. Walmart's stock has climbed more than 24% in the past year, and over 11% so far in 2026. That has outpaced the nearly 16% and 2% gains in those time frames, respectively, for the S&P 500. The retailer's inclusion in a group heavy on tech companies illustrates much about its ambitions. Walmart has tried to grow profits faster than sales in recent years by leaning into its third-party marketplace and advertising businesses — both of which bring higher margins than its traditional brick-and-mortar operations.The boom in its online selling platform followed the path of key rival Amazon. And Walmart put out the clearest signal yet of its tech ambitions when it listed on the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 last month.The milestone comes only days into the tenure of new Walmart CEO John Furner, who took the position on Sunday. He succeeded longtime Chief Executive Doug McMillon.watch nowAs CEO of Walmart's U.S. business, Furner oversaw many of the key initiatives that drove the retailer's growth in recent years. Efforts like curbside pickup and better private-label brands helped the discounter draw higher-income shoppers as elevated inflation bit into grocery budgets.For its fiscal 2026 third quarter reported in November, Walmart said revenue rose 5.8%, boosted by a 27% jump in e-commerce sales and 53% growth for its advertising business. Walmart said it expected sales growth of 4.8% to 5.1% for its full fiscal year.The company is expected to post fiscal fourth-quarter earnings later this month.Correction: Walmart hit the $1 trillion market cap threshold on Tuesday. An earlier version misstated the day. ",

    "body": "President and CEO of NVIDIA, Jensen Huang, attends the 56th annual World Economic Forum (WEF) meeting in Davos, Switzerland, January 21, 2026.Denis Balibouse | ReutersNvidia CEO Jensen Huang said the chipmaker's plan to invest in OpenAI remains \"on track\" after recent reports suggested brewing tension between the two sides. \"There's no drama involved. Everything's on track,\" Huang told CNBC's Jim Cramer on Tuesday. The full interview will air later in the day on \"Mad Money.\"In September, Huang appeared with OpenAI CEO Sam Altman to announce a letter of intent that would involve his company investing up to $100 billion in the artificial intelligence lab in tranches. OpenAI would build AI infrastructure based around Nvidia's technology requiring up to 10 gigawatts of power. But an SEC filing in November said the deal had not been finalized, and concern has mounted in the months sense that the announcement was little more than a press release. Over the past weekend, the Wall Street Journal reported that the deal was \"on ice.\"Nvidia shares fell more than 3.4% today, leading a broad decline in tech stocks, and are 13% off their high reached in October. Huang said on Tuesday that Nvidia would invest in OpenAI's next fundraising round, which he called the \"largest private round ever raised in history.\" OpenAI is engaging in fundraising discussions for a round that could raise as much as $100 billion, CNBC reported last month. \"We will invest in the next round,\" Huang said. \"There is no question about that.\"  He added that Nvidia would consider investing in any future OpenAI round and wants to participate in an eventual OpenAI IPO. OpenAI has used Nvidia's graphics processing units to build and serve its AI models since the company was founded. But in recent months, Altman has said that OpenAI doesn't have enough chips to meet demand for its products like ChatGPT, and that it could generate more revenue with increased computing power. OpenAI has been striking chip deals with Nvidia competitors including Advanced Micro Devices, Broadcom, and Cerebras. In a post on X on Monday, Altman responded to the chatter about his company's relationship with Nvidia.\"We love working with NVIDIA and they make the best AI chips in the world,\" hew wrote. \"We hope to be a gigantic customer for a very long time. I don't get where all this insanity is coming from.\"WATCH: Nvidia and OpenAI respond to reports about their relationshipwatch now",

    "body": "watch nowThe Trump administration's new minerals stockpile initiative — dubbed \"Project Vault\" — can include anything identified as \"critical\" by the U.S. Geological Survey, a White House official told CNBC Tuesday. The agency, part of the Interior Department, lists more than 50 minerals as critical. These include rare earths, lithium, uranium and copper and are deemed \"essential for national security, economic stability and supply chain resilience.\" The minerals are crucial because they \"underpin key industries, drive technological innovation, and support critical infrastructure vital for a modern American economy,\" according to USGS. President Donald Trump on Monday unveiled \"Project Vault,\" which is a first-of-its-kind public-private partnership. The U.S. Export-Import Bank will provide $10 billion in the form of a loan, with about $2 billion coming from private capital. \"You're covering everything with this,\" Trump said during an event at the White House on Monday. \"We're not just doing certain minerals and rare earths. We're doing everything.\"Equipment manufacturers including GE Vernova, Western Digital and Boeing have expressed interest, said EXIM Bank Chairman John Jovanovic in a statement Monday. General Motors CEO Mary Barra attended the White House event that unveiled the stockpile.\"Having a resilient supply chain is critical for our nation, and it's critical for all industry, especially the auto industry,\" Barra said at the White House. Beyond autos, critical minerals are key inputs for the defense, robotics, semiconductor, electronics and energy industries.The stockpile is the latest move by the Trump administration to build a Western supply chain to counter China's dominance in critical minerals — especially when it comes to refining. Beijing sought to cut off exports of rare earths, a subset of critical minerals, last year during trade disputes with the U.S.  The U.S. stockpile will source the minerals at home and abroad, Jovanovic told CNBC in an interview Tuesday. \"We have a network of warehouse facilities in which it's going to be stored in the United States,\" he said. The EXIM Bank is talking to companies who want to leverage the reserve to bring their projects to a financial close and commercial operations date, Jovanovic said. The stockpile is part of a broader Trump administration strategy. It has also taken equity stakes in several mining companies in an effort to bolster them against state-backed competition in China. The Pentagon inked a landmark deal last July with rare-earth miner MP Materials that included an equity stake, price floor and offtake agreement. The Commerce Department last week announced plans to finance the startup critical-mineral company USA Rare Earth in exchange for an ownership stake, subject to certain closing conditions. The administration has also taken stakes in Lithium Americas and Trilogy Metals. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum said last April that the U.S. is also considering a sovereign risk insurance fund that would protect companies' investments in mining projects from cancellation by future U.S. administrations. \"Those three things would put us in the game around critical minerals — the stockpiling, the sovereign risk insurance and the ability to take an equity position. We're working on all three of those,\" Burgum said at a conference in Oklahoma City last year. ",

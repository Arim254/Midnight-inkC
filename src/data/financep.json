    "body": "File photo of a U.S. LGM-30G Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic missile inside a silo about 60 miles from Grand Forks Air Force Base, North Dakota.Universal History Archive | Universal Images Group | Getty ImagesU.S. President Donald Trump on Thursday directed the Pentagon to restart nuclear weapons testing \"on an equal basis,\" citing testing programs by other countries.Speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One after meeting Chinese President Xi Jinping in South Korea, Trump said the decision \"had to do with others,\" without naming specific countries.\"They seem to all be nuclear testing. We have more nuclear weapons than anybody. We don't do testing ... But with others doing testing, I think it's appropriate that we do also,\" he said, adding that details on the planned tests would be announced later.Before his meeting with Xi, Trump wrote on Truth Social that \"because of other countries testing programs, I have instructed the Department of War to start testing our Nuclear Weapons on an equal basis. That process will begin immediately.\"It was not immediately clear what Trump meant by \"equal basis.\" The Department of Defense was rebranded the Department of War on Sept. 5 under an executive order, though Congress has not approved the change.The announcement followed reports that Russia had successfully tested a Poseidon nuclear-powered super torpedo on Wednesday.\"For the first time, we managed not only to launch it with a launch engine from a carrier submarine, but also to launch the nuclear power unit on which this device passed a certain amount of time,\" Russian President Vladimir Putin was quoted as saying.Moscow also tested its new Burevestnik nuclear cruise missile on Oct. 21 and conducted nuclear launch drills a day later.The U.S. has not conducted a live nuclear weapons test since 1992, when then-President George H.W. Bush imposed a unilateral testing moratorium.In 1996, the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty was signed by then-President Bill Clinton.Trump also claimed in his Truth Social post that the U.S. has the world's largest nuclear arsenal, adding that Russia and China would match its nuclear weapon stockpile within five years — a statement contradicted by independent data.According to estimates by the Arms Control Association, the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons and the Federation of American Scientists, Russia possesses the most nuclear weapons in the world.Russia is estimated to have 5,459 nuclear weapons in 2025, compared to 5,177 for the U.S. and 600 for China, according to the Federation of American Scientists. The nonprofit was founded in 1945 by atomic scientists after World War II to advocate for international oversight of nuclear energy.",

    "body": "U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell holds a press conference after the Fed cut interest rates by quarter of a percentage point, in Washington, D.C., U.S., Oct. 29, 2025.Kevin Lamarque | ReutersThe Federal Reserve meeting that wrapped up Wednesday both delivered on expectations and offered a few surprises. Here are five key takeaways:The Federal Open Market Committee, as expected, delivered its quarter percentage point rate cut, but not without some backstage intrigue that included two dissenting votes — one in each direction. While Governor Stephen Miran delivered a widely anticipated \"no\" vote because he preferred a half-point reduction, Kansas City Fed President Jeffrey Schmid wanted no cut, speaking for what is an apparently growing group of inflation hawks who are worried about the Fed's easing bias.Using uncharacteristically strong language, Chair Jerome Powell pushed back hard on another cut in December for which markets had been assigning about a 90% probability of happening. \"In the committee's discussions at this meeting, there were strongly differing views about how to proceed in December,\" Powell said during his news conference. \"A further reduction in the policy rate at the December meeting is not a foregone conclusion. Far from it.\" He went on to note there were \"strongly different views\" expressed by the 19 meeting participants and noted that the tone would be reflected in the meeting minutes, released in three weeks.Markets knew the end of QT was coming, but just weren't set on when. The committee laid that to rest and said quantitative tightening, or allowing assets to roll off the Fed's $6.6 trillion balance sheet, would end after the November operations. While Powell doused talk of a December cut, ending QT then could have a similar impact. At the same time, the committee indicated it would be reinvesting maturing mortgage notes in short-term bills, which Powell said will tilt the balance sheet to shorter duration with an even stronger lean toward Treasurys.On the question of inflation, Powell gave indications that it is drifting back towards the Fed's 2% goal but remains elevated — around 2.8% by the Fed's preferred measure. Tariffs are providing a boost to that number in the half percentage point range, but Powell said the view continues to be that the impact from the levies will be temporary. The inflation forecast for October is significant in that the Commerce Department will not be releasing an official number on the personal consumption expenditures price index due to the government shutdown.Powell gave a nod towards the uncertainty from the shutdown, but said the lack of public data likely doesn't change the economic picture, one of moderating growth, rising unemployment and \"somewhat elevated\" inflation. \"Although some important federal government data have been delayed due to the shutdown, the public and private sector data that have remained available suggests that the outlook for employment and inflation has not changed much since our meeting in September,\" he said.What they're saying:\"He kind of did a WWE slam on those expectations of a December rate cut. [The door is] not completely closed, I guess, but it was expected to be a foregone conclusion. And he came out pretty vociferously and said, 'Nope, better not think about it that way.'\" — Dan North, senior economist at Allianz\"So, regardless of the use of alternative data sources the Fed can draw on, we believe there is an increased chance that December's meeting may skip a cut, which would push off further accommodative rate moves into the new year, and potentially to a new Chair.\" — Rick Rieder, head of fixed income at BlackRock and finalist for Powell's job when his term as chair expires in May\"He tried to say it is not a foregone conclusion, but a December rate cut still seems likely. No Fed leader wants to be responsible for a slowdown or a recession.\" — Heather Long, chief economist at Navy Federal Credit Union",

The stock price is down more than 27% year-to-date.The warning on one-off charges came despite what appeared to be a fairly positive third quarter. It's likely to be seen as a welcome boost as CEO Antonio Filosa executes his turnaround plan.Stellantis said net revenues for the July-September period came in at 37.2 billion euros ($43.2 billion), reflecting an increase of 13% year-on-year, mainly driven by growth in its North American and European markets.Analysts had expected third-quarter net revenues to come in at 36.58 billion euros, according to an LSEG-compiled consensus.Read more\"As we continue to implement important strategic changes in order to provide our customers with greater freedom of choice, we have seen positive sequential progress and solid year-over-year performance in Q3, marked by the return of top-line growth,\" Stellantis' Filosa said in a statement.\"We are also taking decisive actions to align Stellantis' resources, programs and plans to support long-term, profitable growth, including our recently announced $13 billion investment in the U.S.,\" he added.Stellantis unveiled plans to invest in the U.S. earlier this month as part of a push to accelerate growth and expand its domestic footprint. It marked the largest U.S. investment in the firm's 100-year history, which the company said will include the launch of five new vehicles and the creation of more than 5,000 jobs.The announcement comes amid President Donald Trump's efforts to create more manufacturing jobs in the U.S. through the use of aggressive tariffs, especially for the automotive industry.

The trim came as the euro zone's annual inflation rate hit 2%, the ECB's target, though the rate of price rises has risen since, to 2.2% in September.Despite a lackluster growth outlook, economists say the central bank is unlikely to cut interest rates again for a while.\"The ECB's rate cutting cycle appears to be over, at least for now, with firmer business activity and rising inflation leaving few doubts that the Governing Council will sit on its hands for a while yet,\" Matthew Ryan, head of Market Strategy at financial services firm Ebury, said in emailed comments.Natasha May, global market analyst at J.P. Morgan Asset Management, cautioned that the ECB cannot afford to rest on its laurels, however.\"Recent euro zone activity data has been positive, including October's flash PMIs and this morning's first estimate of third quarter GDP. Growth surprised to the upside despite trade headwinds, and national prints suggest domestic demand remains on an uptrend,\" she noted in emailed comments. Given this, and expectations that inflation will moderate, ECB President Christine Lagarde's mantra that the central bank's policy is in a \"good place\" seems a sensible one, May added.\"But we should not discount the possibility that the ECB deliver a few more cuts next year. With Chinese exports to the euro zone up 15% year-on-year in September and expectations for future energy prices moving lower, disinflationary forces are gathering momentum,\" she said. Paired with a strong euro, May added that this could lead euro zone inflation to undershoot the ECB's forecasts next year – which already sit below the bank's 2% target. \"The Governing Council cannot become complacent,\" she said.",

Antranik Tavitian | ReutersEli Lilly on Thursday reported third-quarter earnings and revenue that topped estimates and hiked its full-year outlook, as the company continued to see strong demand for its blockbuster weight loss drug Zepbound and diabetes treatment Mounjaro.Shares of the company rose 5% in premarket trading Thursday.The pharmaceutical giant now expects its fiscal 2025 revenue to come in between $63 billion and $63.5 billion, up from a previous guidance of $60 to $62 billion. Eli Lilly also expects full-year adjusted profit to come in between $23 and $23.70 per share, up from its previous outlook of $21.75 to $23 a share.Eli Lilly said the guidance reflects President Donald Trump's existing tariffs as of Thursday, but does not include his threatened levies on pharmaceuticals imported into the U.S.Mounjaro raked in $6.52 billion in revenue for the quarter, up 109% from the same period a year ago. That blew past the $5.51 billion that analysts were expecting, according to StreetAccount. Zepbound, which entered the market roughly two years ago, posted $3.57 billion in revenue for the third quarter. That's up 184% from the year-earlier period and slightly ahead of the $3.5 billion that Wall Street was expecting, according to StreetAccount estimates.Here's what Eli Lilly reported for the third quarter compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG: Earnings per share: $7.02 adjusted vs. $5.69 expectedRevenue: $17.60 billion vs. $16.01 billion expectedThe results come as Eli Lilly works to maintain its edge over chief rival Novo Nordisk in the booming market for a class of obesity and diabetes drugs called GLP-1s.The company posted third-quarter revenue of $17.60 billion, up 54% from the same period a year ago. Sales in the U.S. jumped 45% to $11.30 billion. Eli Lilly said that was driven by a 60% increase in volume — or the number of prescriptions or units sold — for its products, primarily for Mounjaro and Zepbound. That was partially offset by lower realized prices of the drugs, the company said.The pharmaceutical giant booked net income of $5.58 billion, or $6.21 per share, for the third quarter. That compares with net income of $970.3 million, or $1.07 per share, a year earlier. Excluding one-time items associated with the value of intangible assets and other adjustments, Eli Lilly posted earnings of $7.02 per share for the second quarter.The results underscore Eli Lilly's strong advantage in the booming GLP-1 drug market.The company has gained the majority market share over the last year, thanks to the strong profile of its weight loss and diabetes injections and a boost from its direct-to-consumer sales, among other efforts. Eli Lilly took another stride to boost access to Zepbound on Wednesday, partnering with Walmart to offer in-store pickup of discounted vials of the drug for cash-paying patients. The company is now betting on its closely-watched experimental obesity pill, orforglipron, to solidify its dominance in the space, especially as Novo Nordisk and other drugmakers race to bring their own pills or next-generation injections to the market. On Thursday, Novo Nordisk launched a rival bid for U.S. obesity biotech company Metsera, hijacking an offer from Pfizer as it races to catch up to Eli Lilly.This story is developing.

    "body": "The Shell gas station logo is displayed on February 13, 2025 in Austin, Texas.Brandon Bell | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesBritish oil major Shell on Thursday reported stronger-than-expected third-quarter profit, citing robust operational performance and higher trading contributions.Shell posted adjusted earnings of $5.4 billion for the quarter, beating analyst expectations of $5.05 billion, according to an LSEG-compiled consensus. A separate, company-provided analyst forecast had put Shell's expected third-quarter profit at $5.09 billion.The London-headquartered firm reported adjusted earnings of $6 billion over the same period last year and $4.26 billion for this year's April-June period.\"Shell delivered another strong set of results, with clear progress across our portfolio and excellent performance in our Marketing business and deepwater assets in the Gulf of America and Brazil,\" Shell CEO Wael Sawan said in a statement.The company also announced another $3.5 billion in share buybacks over the next three months, maintaining the pace of its shareholder returns. The company said it marked the 16th consecutive quarter of at least $3 billion in buybacks.Shell's net debt came in at $41.2 billion at the end of the third quarter, down from $43.2 billion on a quarterly basis.The oil major's London-listed share price slipped 0.8% on Thursday morning. The stock price is up more 16% year-to-date, outperforming its industry peers.\"Numbers are solid in virtually all divisions and shows earning growth and strong cash flow generation,\" said Maurizio Carulli, global energy and materials analyst at Quilter Cheviot.\"Of note the robust production in Brazil and the Gulf of Mexico. The LNG Canada ramp up, with an initial 13 cargos in Q3, benefited the results as well. The only weak part was Chemicals, but it is a small part of the business and Shell's management is trying to find a strategic solution for it,\" Carulli said.Other third-quarter highlights included:Adjusted earnings fell 9.9% compared to the same period last year.Cash flow from operations (CFFO) came in at $12.2 billion for the third quarter, compared to $14.7 billion in the same period last year.Cash capital expenditure for the quarter stood at $4.9 billion.Shell's results come as French oil major TotalEnergies reported a slight drop in third-quarter profit as oil and gas production growth helped to offset lower crude prices.Norwegian energy firm Equinor, for its part, on Wednesday posted a steeper-than-expected drop in third-quarter profit, with adjusted operating income coming in at $6.21 billion for the July-September period.U.S. oil giants Exxon Mobil and Chevron are both scheduled to report third-quarter results on Friday, with Britain's BP set to follow suit on Tuesday.Analysts expect Big Oil's shareholder payouts to come under pressure over the coming months, with energy majors looking to tighten their belts amid a weaker crude price environment.",

    "body": "Headquarters of Samsung in Mountain View, California, on October 28, 2018. Smith Collection/gado | Archive Photos | Getty ImagesSamsung Electronics reported a rebound in earnings on Thursday, with operating profit more than doubling from the previous quarter, bolstered by strong memory chip demand from artificial intelligence servers. Here are Samsung's third-quarter results compared with LSEG SmartEstimate, which is weighted toward forecasts from analysts who are more consistently accurate:Revenue: 86.1 trillion Korean won ($60.5 billion) vs. 85.93 trillion won Operating profit: 12.2 trillion won vs. 11.25 trillion wonThe South Korean technology giant's quarterly revenue rose 8.85% from a year earlier, while its first-quarter operating profit climbed 32.9% in the same period. Samsung shares popped nearly 4% in early trading in Asia.The earnings represent a bounce back from the June quarter, which had been weighed down by a massive slump in Samsung's chip business. Operating profit increased by 160% compared to June, while revenue increased by 15.5% over the same period. Samsung Electronics, South Korea's largest company by market capitalization, is a leading provider of memory chips, semiconductor foundry services and smartphones.The company's earnings were lifted by its chip business, which saw operating profit increase over tenfold from the June quarter on strong demand for AI servers.Samsung predicted that AI chip demand would continue to grow, echoing sentiments from memory rival SK Hynix, which reported earnings on Wednesday.\"We expect data center companies to continuously expand their hardware investment because of the ongoing competition to secure AI infrastructure,\" a Samsung executive said during an earnings call.\"Therefore, our AI-related server demand keeps growing, and this demand significantly exceeds industry supply,\" he added.Chip Business Samsung's chip business reported a 19% increase in sales from the June quarter, with its memory business setting an all-time high for quarterly sales, driven by strong demand for artificial intelligence.Chip revenue increased to 33.1 trillion Korean won, up 13% from last year, while operating profit rose 81% to 7.0 trillion Korean won over the same period.Also known as its Device Solutions division, Samsung's chip business encompasses memory chips, semiconductor design and its foundry units.Samsung said the unit benefited from a favorable price environment, while quarterly revenues reached a record high on expanded sales of its high-bandwidth memory (HBM) chips — a type of memory used in artificial intelligence computing.The company has found itself lagging behind memory rival SK Hynix in the HBM market, after it was slow to secure major contracts with leading AI chip Nvidia. However, in a positive sign for the company, it reportedly passed Nvidia's qualification tests for an advanced HBM chip last month.A report from Counterpoint Research earlier this month found that Samsung had reclaimed the top spot in the memory market ahead of SK Hynix in the third quarter after falling behind its competitor for the first time the quarter prior. MS Hwang, research director at Counterpoint Research, told CNBC that Samsung's third-quarter performance was a clear result of a broader \"memory market boom\" and rising prices for general-purpose memory.Heading into 2026, Samsung said its memory business will focus on the mass production of its next-generation HBM technology, HBM4.Smartphones Samsung's mobile experience and network businesses, tasked with developing and selling smartphones, tablets, wearables and other devices, reported a rise in both sales and profit.The unit posted an operating profit of 3.6 trillion won in the third quarter, up about 28% from the same period last year. The company said earnings were driven by robust flagship smartphone sales, including the launch of its Galaxy Z Fold7 device.Samsung forecasted that the rapid growth of the AI industry would open up new market opportunities for both its devices and chip businesses in the current quarter.",

    "body": "A man holds a sign reading \"SNAP Feeds Families,\" as food aid benefits will be suspended starting November 1 amid the ongoing U.S. government shutdown, during \"A Rally for SNAP\" on the steps of the Massachusetts Statehouse in Boston, Massachusetts, U.S., October 28, 2025.   Brian Snyder | ReutersNearly 42 million Americans are days away from missing their monthly food stamp check as the government shutdown enters its 28th day.The Trump administration has said funds for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, will not be distributed if the federal government is still shut down on Nov. 1. With little movement toward a resolution on Capitol Hill, Congress appears set to blow past that deadline.The expiration of aid would have a devastating effect on millions of households already struggling to afford food, and force people across the country to seek help at food banks. The lapse in that spending would also have a ripple effect on the economy, from small grocers to massive chains like Walmart and even retailers that sell discretionary merchandise.There will be \"an immediate effect on the purchasing mix\" toward lower profit margin groceries and household staples, and the potential for more theft as food budgets dry up, Wolfe Research analyst Spencer Hanus wrote in a note to investors Monday. Consumer confidence among lower-income Americans could also take a hit heading into the holiday season, Hanus said.SNAP recipients received an average of about $187 per month in fiscal 2024, according to government data. Among those beneficiaries, 73% live below the poverty line, which is currently $32,150 or less for a family of four.Following years of high food inflation and other recent hits to the size of government benefits, the loss of that assistance would be a massive blow to many low-income Americans.Consumers who use SNAP benefits to pay for groceries spend more, and shop more often, than other shoppers, according to data from Numerator. On average, a SNAP beneficiary spends $832 per month on groceries, 20% more than a non-SNAP shopper, though the amount spent on each trip averages 12% less, or about $20.80 per outing, the market research company said. SNAP shoppers visit more retailers per month at 6.6, compared to 6.1 for people who don't receive the aid, according to Numerator.Hanus said his firm is seeing Google search interest for \"food banks\" and \"food stamps\" surge as SNAP beneficiaries look for alternatives. While there is often a spike in interest in those terms around Thanksgiving, he said \"it is up materially year over year, implying that this consumer is feeling a shock here.\"The potential loss of aid from the shutdown is the second recent hit to government food assistance programs for lower-income Americans. The One Big Beautiful Act legislation passed by Republicans this year cuts SNAP benefits by an estimated 20%.Hanus estimates the spending changes in the bill equate to a 1.5% to 2% hit to retail industry sales.The retailers most reliant on SNAP benefit spendingA person shops at a Dollar General store on May 28, 2025 in Chicago, Illinois. Scott Olson | Getty ImagesWhile there are different ways to consider how a lapse in SNAP benefits could impact retailers, grocers will likely take a hit. And the effects could reach employees.\"Often, grocers' staffing and inventory are planned around benefit cycles, so a lapse could lead to reduced employee hours, perishable food losses, and declining sales,\" industry group the National Grocers Association said in a statement. \"Furthermore, when benefits are restored, the resulting surge in demand could strain supply chains nationwide.\"Numerator data shows Walmart, Dollar General and Dollar Tree are more likely to cater to SNAP shoppers, while Target, Costco and Amazon-owned Whole Foods are less likely. Hanus estimates a high-single digit percent of Walmart's sales are related to SNAP, while Dollar General and Dollar Tree are in the mid-single digits.But SNAP users spend the most annually on groceries at Walmart, followed by Kroger and Costco, according to Numerator.Customers enter a Walmart store on April 09, 2025 in San Leandro, California.Justin Sullivan | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesWalmart is the country's largest retailer, and its largest grocer. It also captures significantly more SNAP grocery spending than competitors, Numerator found. More than 94% of SNAP shoppers have bought food there in the past year, with an average annual spend of $2,653, or 26% of the cohort's annual grocery spending.Just under half, or 48.8%, of all SNAP recipients shopped at Kroger in the past year, spending an average $1,687.67 annually, or 8.6% of the group's total yearly grocery spend.While it requires a membership to shop, Costco takes the third spot for where SNAP users buy groceries by average annual spend at $1,482.98. Walmart-owned membership club Sam's Club captures the fourth spot for share of spend at 3.8% and does offer discounted memberships for new members who verify participation on a government assistance plan.Walmart referred CNBC to the National Retail Federation, which said cutting off funding for food aid \"creates a crisis for millions of American families.\" Albertsons referred CNBC to the Food Industry Association, which called on Congress to reopen the government and \"ensure that these vital programs remain dependable for those who have to rely on them to get them through a difficult time.\"Costco declined to comment. Kroger, Dollar General, Dollar Tree, Amazon and Whole Foods did not immediately respond to requests for comment.In all, 3.6% of U.S. in-store grocery trips paid using the government's SNAP or Women, Infants and Children benefits in 2025 through September, which is down from 3.9% in 2024, according to Numerator. That share has fallen from the pandemic peak of 6.5% in November 2021, when there was an additional emergency allotment. However, more grocery trips are funded with SNAP benefits now than pre-pandemic, when between 2.2% and 2.8% of groceries were purchased under the program in all of the months between February 2019 and February 2020.The impact beyond groceryIf SNAP funding expires, recipients may buy less of other goods, too.\"Fewer dollars in the consumers' wallet forces a reallocation of discretionary dollars towards food and more tepid spending overall,\" said Wells Fargo equity analyst Edward Kelly in a note to investors last week. He noted that retailers reporting earnings in November may say they have seen weaker discretionary spending during that month due to the food assistance expiration.While there has never been a time when the federal government has not come up with a contingency for SNAP funding during shutdowns, states are beginning to step in. New York Gov. Kathy Hochul is working on $30 million in aid for impacted New Yorkers. Plus, missed SNAP benefits should be paid in arrears once the government reopens — though it's unknown when that will be. \"We'd expect an eventual resolution of the government shutdown, which could mean a windfall for low-end consumers into peak shopping season as missed payments are made up,\" Kelly said.",

    "body": "Sundar Pichai, chief executive officer of Alphabet Inc., during the Bloomberg Tech conference in San Francisco, California, US, on Wednesday, June 4, 2025. David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesGoogle parent Alphabet is planning a \"significant increase\" in spend next year as it continues to invest in AI infrastructure to meet the demand of its customer backlog, executives said Wednesday.The company reported its first $100 billion revenue quarter on Wednesday, beating Wall Street's expectations for Alphabet's third quarter. Executives then said that the company plans to grow its capital spend for this year.\"With the growth across our business and demand from Cloud customers, we now expect 2025 capital expenditures to be in a range of $91 billion to $93 billion,\" the company said in its earnings report. It marks the second time the company increased its capital expenditure this year. In July, the company increased its expectation from $75 billion to $85 billion, most of which goes toward investments in projects like new data centers.There'll be even more spend in 2026, executives said Wednesday.\"Looking out to 2026, we expect a significant increase in CapEx and will provide more detail on our fourth quarter earnings call,\" said Anat Ashkenazi, Alphabet's finance chief.The latest increases come as companies across the industry race to build more infrastructure to keep up with billions in customer demand for the compute necessary to power AI services. Also on Wednesday, Meta raised the low end of its guidance for 2025 capital expenditures by $4 billion, saying it expects that figure to come in between $70 billion and $72 billion. That figure was previously $66 billion to $72 billion.Google executives explained that they're racing to meet demand for cloud services, which saw a 46% quarter-over-quarter growth to the backlog in the third quarter.\"We continue to drive strong growth in new businesses,\" CEO Sundar Pichai said. \"Google Cloud accelerated, ending the quarter with $155 billion in backlog.\"The company reported 32% cloud revenue growth from the year prior and is keeping pace with its megacap competitors. Pichai and Ashkenazi said the company has received more $1 billion deals in the last nine months than it had in the past two years combined. In August, Google won a $10 billion cloud contract from Meta spanning six years. Anthropic last week announced a deal that gives the artificial intelligence company access to up to 1 million of Google's custom-designed Tensor Processing Units, or TPUs. The deal is worth tens of billions of dollars.The spend on infrastructure is also helping the company improve its own AI products, executives said on the call.Google's flagship AI app Gemini now has more than 650 million monthly active users. That's up from the 450 million active users Pichai reported the previous quarter. Search also improved thanks to AI advancements, executives said. Google's search business generated $56.56 billion in revenue — up 15% from the prior year, tempering fears that the competitive AI landscape may be cannibalizing the company's core search and ads business.AI Mode, Google's AI product that lays within its search engine, has 75 million daily active users in the U.S., and those search queries doubled over the third quarter, executives said. They also reiterated that the company is testing ads in that AI Mode product.WATCH: Google catching up with Meta pulled on shares following earnings, says D.A. Davidson's Gil Luriawatch now",

    "body": "Brian Roberts, Chairman and CEO of Comcast, attends the annual Allen & Co. Media and Technology Conference in Sun Valley, Idaho on July 9th, 2025. David A. Grogan | CNBCComcast reported earnings Thursday, and it could shed light on how executives view regulators' attitude toward a potential NBCUniversal-Warner Bros. Discovery merger.Warner Bros. Discovery, the owner of TNT Sports, CNN, HBO, Warner Bros. studio and other media assets, officially put itself up for sale after \"receiving interest from multiple parties,\" WBD CEO David Zaslav said in a statement last week. CNBC reported Comcast is among the interested parties.Several pundits and analysts have posited that Comcast has little to no chance to do a deal from a regulatory perspective, given President Donald Trump's pointed words for Comcast co-CEO and controlling shareholder Brian Roberts. Others say the path forward may not be doomed.Trump in April called Comcast and Roberts \"a disgrace to the integrity of Broadcasting\" in a post on his social media platform, Truth Social. Trump has also called Roberts a \"lowlife\" and has referred to Comcast as \"Concast.\"Some equity research analysts have predicted that the Trump administration would block a Comcast acquisition of Warner Bros. Discovery. WBD is still moving toward a planned separation into two publicly traded entities while it expands its strategic review.Paramount is trying to buy the whole company, before it could split, and WBD has thus far rejected three separate offers from the David Ellison-run company.\"It is almost certain that the Trump DOJ would not allow CMSCA to buy WBD and the result would be decided in court,\" New Street Research analyst Blair Levin wrote in a note to clients, citing Trump's public comments about Roberts.\"We along with our cable colleagues believe [Comcast's] political standing in this administration is very low and believe CMCSA would think long and hard about whether a deal is worth the long, arduous process of creating enough goodwill to close the deal,\" wrote Raymond James analyst Ric Prentiss.Some Comcast executives think the regulatory concerns are either overblown or, at least, far too early to ascertain, according to people familiar with the matter, who have knowledge of Comcast's strategy but spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal thinking. There's some evidence suggesting Comcast's executives may have a point.A Comcast spokesperson declined to comment.Get the CNBC Sport newsletter directly to your inboxThe CNBC Sport newsletter with Alex Sherman brings you the biggest news and exclusive interviews from the worlds of sports business and media, delivered weekly to your inbox.Subscribe here to get access today.If it pleases the presidentSkydance Media received long-awaited Federal Communications Commission approval for its merger with Paramount after the CBS parent agreed to a $16 million settlement with Trump over a \"60 Minutes\" episode.While a deal for WBD won't require FCC review, because Warner Bros. Discovery doesn't own a broadcaster, a takeover of this size — WBD's market capitalization is about $53 billion plus another $30 billion in debt — could still draw the scrutiny of Trump's Department of Justice.Trump's reputation as a dealmaker suggests Comcast may be able to avoid any interference by endearing itself to the president.Comcast is one of 37 companies donating to Trump's efforts to build a $300 million ballroom for the White House through the Trust for the National Mall.Trump's public dislike toward Roberts and Comcast may be blovation linked to Trump's assertions that MSNBC, owned by Comcast's NBCUniversal, is left-leaning. It's unclear if Trump explicitly cares about Comcast or NBCUniversal owning any of the WBD assets other than CNN, which Trump has also routinely criticized.If his primary issue with Comcast buying WBD is CNN, a divestiture or deal without the network could circumvent those issues. Comcast is in the process of spinning off MSNBC into Versant, which will also become the parent company of CNBC.While Roberts will still be a shareholder of Versant, MSNBC will no longer be a part of Comcast once Versant becomes its own publicly traded company at the start of 2026.Structuring a spin-mergeIn a hypothetical situation in which Comcast were to spin off NBCUniversal, which is currently slated to remain with the company following the Versant transaction, and merge it with WBD, LightShed analyst Rich Greenfield predicted that deal could get through regulators.Wolfe Research's Peter Supino proposed a plan under which NBCUniversal would issue new stock to WBD at an exchange ratio (eliminating Roberts' voting control over the new company) and appoint a chairman and CEO \"not named Roberts.\" That combination could lead to a deal, he wrote in a note to clients.\"The primary problems facing a Comcast bid — financing and politics — might be solvable,\" Supino wrote.While Comcast may shy away from pursuing a transaction that could be blocked by the Trump DOJ, even that may not be a dealbreaker.In the first Trump term, his DOJ blocked AT&T's acquisition of Time Warner, an earlier iteration of Warner Bros. Discovery. In June 2018, a U.S. District Court judge approved the $85.4 billion sale, ruling the government failed to prove the deal would harm consumers.Disclosure: Comcast is the parent company of NBCUniversal, which owns CNBC. Versant would become the new parent company of CNBC upon Comcast's planned spinoff of Versant.",

    "body": "UNIVERSAL STUDIOS, ORLANDO, FLORIDA, UNITED STATES - 2019/07/18: Comcast sign logo in the wall of a building at Universal Studios. (Photo by Roberto Machado Noa/LightRocket via Getty Images)Roberto Machado Noa | Lightrocket | Getty ImagesComcast topped Wall Street earnings and revenue estimates for the third quarter on Thursday, despite once again reporting a loss in broadband customers. The company said it lost 104,000 domestic broadband customers during the period, bringing its total subscriber base to roughly 31.4 million. This marked the fourth quarter in a row that Comcast failed to grow its broadband customer base. Earlier this year the company outlined initiatives meant to drive broadband growth — the cornerstone of Comcast's business — as it has faced fraught competition from alternative providers, namely 5G companies. The company, soon to be led by co-CEOs Brian Roberts and Mike Cavanagh, will be even more reliant on connectivity in the new year after its planned Versant transaction to offload cable network assets. Still, Comcast's business, which consists of the Xfinity-branded broadband, cable TV and mobile group as well as NBCUniversal, outperformed Wall Street's estimates. Shares of the company rose about 2.5% in premarket trading.Here's how Comcast performed for the period compared with average analyst estimates, according to LSEG:Earnings per share: $1.12 adjusted vs. $1.10 expectedRevenue: $31.2 billion vs. $30.70 billion expectedFor the quarter ended Sept. 30, net income attributable to Comcast decreased 8% to $3.33 billion, or 90 cents per share, compared with $3.63 billion, or 94 cents per share, a year earlier. Adjusting for one-time items, such as interest expense and the value of certain assets, Comcast reported earnings per share of $1.12 for the quarter. The company's adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization was down roughly 1% to $9.7 billion. Overall revenue fell nearly 3% to $31.2 billion, compared with $32.1 billion in the same period last year. Revenue for the company's connectivity and platforms business – or broadband, mobile, pay TV and other services – came in at $20.18 billion, down nearly 1% from the same period last year. Comcast once again said it added a record number of mobile customers – 414,000 during the third quarter, bringing its total to 8.9 million lines. Cable companies like Comcast have been leaning on their mobile businesses for growth as broadband subscribers lag.  The exodus from the pay TV bundle continued during the third quarter, with Comcast reporting the segment lost 257,000 customers during the period. As of Sept. 30, Comcast had 11.5 million domestic pay TV customers. Comcast's NBCUniversal is in the process of spinning out its portfolio of cable TV networks, including CNBC. That transaction is set to be completed by the end of the year.Revenue for the company's media unit, which houses NBCUniversal, was $6.6 billion, down almost 20% during the period. Excluding the impact of the Summer Olympics, which took place during the same period last year, revenue was up 4% year over year. The media division reported EBITDA of $832 million, up 28% year over year, driven in part by streaming service Peacock. Peacock, which had 41 million subscribers as of Sept. 30 — essentially flat for the last three quarters — reported losses of $217 million for the quarter, an improvement from $436 million in losses during the same period last year. In October NBCUniversal's media rights deal with the NBA kicked off, bringing professional basketball back to broadcast network NBC and introducing it to Peacock. The addition of the NBA is expected to give Peacock a boost. Meanwhile, revenue for the film studio was up 6% to $3 billion – boosted by the release of \"Jurassic World Rebirth\" in July. Theme park revenue increased nearly 19% to $2.72 billion, with EBITDA for that unit up 13% to $958 million due to the opening of Epic Universe in May. Disclosure: Comcast is the parent company of NBCUniversal, which owns CNBC. Versant would become the new parent company of CNBC upon Comcast's planned spinoff of Versant.",

    "body": "Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg makes a keynote speech at the Meta Connect annual event, at the company's headquarters in Menlo Park, California, Sept. 25, 2024.Manuel Orbegozo | ReutersMeta shares dropped as much as 9% on Wednesday after the company reported third-quarter earnings that beat on sales, but it also reported a $15.93 billion one-time tax charge.Here's how the company did, compared with estimates from analysts polled by LSEG:Earnings per share: $7.25 adj. vs. $6.69 estimatedRevenue: $51.24 billion vs. $49.41 billion estimatedMeta said that the implementation of President Donald Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill Act resulted in the one-time, non-cash income tax charge. The company said it expects Trump's law to result in \"a significant reduction\" in its U.S. federal cash tax payments for the rest of 2025 and future years.The company's third-quarter sales rose 26% year-over-year, which is its highest revenue growth since the first quarter of 2024.Meta said it expects fourth quarter revenue to be in the range of $56 billon to $59 billion. The midpoint of that range comes in above what was expected by analysts, according to StreetAccount.The company raised the low end of its total expenses for the year by $2 billion, saying expenses will come in between $116 billion to $118 billion. That figure was previously $114 billion to $118 billion.CEO Mark Zuckerberg said Meta consistently requires more computing power for its artificial intelligence initiatives, resulting in more spending on related data center and cloud services.\"That suggests that being able to make a significantly larger investment here is very likely to be a profitable thing over, over some period,\" Zuckerberg added.The company also raised its 2025 guidance for capital expenditures, which will now come in the range of $70 billion to $72 billion. It's prior outlook was between the range of $66 to $72 billion.Meta's Reality Labs hardware unit reported a third-quarter loss of $4.4 billion on $470 million in sales.Revenue for Reality Labs in the fourth quarter is expected to come in lower than it did for the same period in 2024, Meta finance chief Susan Li said on a call with analysts. Li said that was due to the company not releasing a new VR headset this year and because retailers who bought inventory of Meta's previous headset for the holiday shopping season did so during the third quarter.\"We're still expecting significant year-over-year growth in AI glasses revenue in Q4 as we benefit from strong demand for the recent products that we've introduced, but that is more than offset by the headwinds to the Quest headsets,\" Li said.The company in September revealed the $799 Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses, which are Meta's first consumer-ready AI glasses with a built-in display and an accompanying wristband with neural technology. Zuckerberg said the product is sold out and that demo slots are booked through the end of November.\"We're going to have to invest in increasing manufacturing and selling more of those,\" he said.The company said that it saw 3.54 billion daily active people across its apps for the quarter, ahead of Wall Street's expectations of 3.5 billion daily active people.Meta's advertising sales were $50.08 billion during the third quarter, ahead of Wall Street's expectations of $48.5 billion.The company has spent the year investing heavily in AI, and it conducted a massive overhaul of the organization leading those efforts after the lukewarm debut of its open-source Llama 4 software in April.Meta said last Wednesday that it would lay off about 600 workers in its Superintelligence Labs AI unit, but it left that group's top-tier TBD Labs unscathed. A day before, Meta said it formed a joint venture agreement with Blue Owl Capital in a deal worth $27 billion to help fund and build a gigantic data center in Richland Parish, Louisiana.Meta said that its employee headcount was 78,450 as of Sept. 30, representing an 8% year-over-year increase.The company in September added Vibes to its Meta AI app. That feature is a feed of AI-generated videos. Since Vibes was released, downloads of Meta AI on both iOS and Android are up 56% month-to-month to a total of 3.9 million downloads as of Oct. 18, according to data provided to CNBC by mobile research firm Appfigures.\"Vibes is an example of a new content type enabled by AI, and I think that there are more opportunities to build many more novel types of content ahead,\" Zuckerberg said.Correction: Analysts expected Meta revenue to come in at $49.41 billion. That number was misstated in the earlier version of this story.WATCH: Meta reports Q3 earnings beat, company takes one-time tax chargewatch now",

    "body": "Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella speaks at Axel Springer Neubau in Berlin on Oct. 17, 2023.Ben Kriemann | Getty ImagesMicrosoft reported better-than-expected results for its fiscal first quarter as revenue in the company's Azure cloud business jumped 40%.The stock slipped almost 4% in extended trading after finance chief Amy Hood said growth in capital expenditures will accelerate this fiscal year.Earnings per share: $3.72 vs. $3.67 per share expectedRevenue: $77.67 billion vs. $75.33 billion expectedRevenue increased 18% in the fiscal first quarter from $65.6 billion a year ago, according to a release. Net income rose to $27.7 billion from $24.67 billion, or $3.30 per share, during the same period last year.Microsoft said its investment in OpenAI resulted in a $3.1 billion hit to net income in the quarter, equivalent to 41 cents per share.Microsoft's Intelligent Cloud unit, which includes Azure, reported $30.9 billion in revenue, up 28% from a year ago and above the StreetAccount consensus of $30.25 billion. Growth in Azure, which competes with Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud, also beat estimates, as analysts polled by StreetAccount had anticipated 38.2% expansion.Cloud continues to be the big driver of growth at Microsoft, as the business has proven to be a major beneficiary of the AI boom. Last quarter, Microsoft disclosed the scale of its Azure cloud infrastructure business in dollars for the first time. The company said revenue in fiscal 2025 from Azure and other cloud services jumped 34% from the prior year to more than $75 billion.For the fiscal second quarter, Microsoft said on the earnings call that expects revenue in the range of $79.5 billion to $80.6 billion. The middle of the range is $80.05 billion, while analysts were expecting $79.95 billion, according to LSEG.The company said it expects Azure growth at constant currency will be 37% in the fiscal second quarter, inline with estimates.Investors were listening closely for Microsoft's commentary on capital expenditures as the company races to build out the infrastructure necessary to support AI demand. Hood said capex for the first quarter came in at $34.9 billion. She told investors in July that the company expected to spend $30 billion in capex and assets acquired through leases during the quarter.Hood said that the capex growth rate for fiscal 2026 will be above the rate in 2025. She'd previously said there would be a slowdown in growth.Microsoft's Productivity and Business Processes segment, which is home to Office productivity software and LinkedIn, delivered $33 billion in revenue for the first quarter, above the $32.33 billion consensus among analysts polled by StreetAccount.The More Personal Computing unit, which includes Windows, search advertising, devices and video games, reported 4% growth to $13.8 billion in revenue. That was above StreetAccount's $12.83 billion consensus.Microsoft's earnings landed hours after the company experienced an outage in Azure and its 365 services. Various websites and games were down for hours, and Microsoft said it expects recovery by this evening.Microsoft shares are up 28% this year, as of Wednesday's close, and hit a record a day earlier. Much of its AI momentum has been attributed to its tight relationship with OpenAI.On Tuesday, OpenAI announced it has completed its restructuring and formally outlined Microsoft's stake in the company. Under the new structure, OpenAI's nonprofit will hold a 26% stake in its for-profit arm, worth about $130 billion. Microsoft will hold a 27% stake worth about $135 billion, and current and former employees and investors will own the remaining 47%.Correction: This story has been updated with the EPS figure that's comparable to analyst estimates.

    "body": "A customer carries a Chipotle bag in San Francisco, California, US, on Friday, Jan. 31, 2025. David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesChipotle Mexican Grill on Wednesday reported quarterly revenue that fell short of expectations and cut its same-store sales forecast for the third straight quarter.Shares of the company plunged 13% in extended trading.Chipotle is expecting its full-year same-store sales to shrink by a low-single digit percentage in fiscal 2025. That's a big change from February, when the burrito chain was projecting same-store sales would grow by a low- to mid-single digit percentage.CEO Scott Boatwright said the company is seeing \"consistent macroeconomic pressures.\" Traffic fell by 0.8%, the third straight quarter of declines.After the chain outperformed the broader restaurant industry in 2024, the sluggish consumer environment finally hit its restaurants this year. Chipotle's customer base skews higher income, so it was insulated from the pullback in spending from low-income consumers that fast-food chains were reporting last year.But now Chipotle is seeing consumers across all income cohorts visit less frequently. Consumers who make less than $100,000, who account for roughly 40% of the company's customer base, have further pulled back their spending, Boatwright said. He added that the group is dining out less often due to concerns about the economy and inflation.Customers between the ages of 25 and 35 years old are particularly challenged, he said on the company's earnings call.\"We tend to skew younger and slightly over-indexed to this group relative to the broader restaurant industry,\" Boatwright said.He cited headwinds like unemployment, increased student loan repayments and slower real wage growth accounting for inflation, which are hurting that particular group of consumers.\"We're not losing that customer. They're just coming less often,\" Boatwright said.watch nowHere's what the company reported compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:Earnings per share: 29 cents adjusted, in line with expectationsRevenue: $3 billion vs. $3.03 billion expectedShares of the restaurant chain fell about 5% in extended trading.Chipotle reported third-quarter net income of $382.1 million, or 29 cents per share, down from $387.4 million, or 28 cents per share, a year earlier.Excluding slight adjustments for stock-based compensation grants and other items, the burrito chain still earned 29 cents per share. Net sales rose 7.5% to $3 billion, fueled by new restaurants. The company opened 84 company-operated locations and two licensed international stores.Chipotle's same-store sales increased 0.3% in a reversal from last quarter's decline. But the growth in sales at restaurants open at least a year came from a 1.1% bump in average check, as traffic dipped.\"While we did see encouraging results as we accelerated our marketing spend and rolled out carne asada and red chimichurri, our underlying trends remain challenged throughout the quarter and into October,\" CFO Adam Rymer said.Boatwright stood by the chain's overall value proposition, saying that it would not turn to discounting to bring back customers. However, he acknowledged that consumers are lumping the chain in with other fast-casual competitors, whose average prices are closer to $15 per entree than Chipotle's roughly $10 price point.To revive traffic growth, Chipotle is focusing on its in-restaurant execution, marketing, digital experience and menu innovation, according to Boatwright.Looking to 2026, Chipotle anticipates that it will open 350 to 370 new locations. That target includes 10 to 15 international restaurants operated by partners, as the company aims to expand globally.Last month, Chipotle announced a joint venture with SPC Group, a Korea-based restaurant operator. It has also signed development deals with operators in the Middle East and Latin America.",

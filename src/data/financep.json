Saul Loeb | AFP | Getty ImagesPresident Donald Trump on Wednesday ordered the Defense Department to purchase power from coal plants, his latest effort to revivte an industry that has struggled to compete against cheaper energy resources.Trump signed the executive order at a White House event attended by Peabody Energy CEO James Grech. The order directs the Pentagon to secure long-term power purchase agreements with coal plants for military installations.\"We're going to be buying a lot of coal through the military now,\" Trump said. Shares of Peabody rose 4% in extended trading. The president said he also directed the Department of Energy to issue funds to keep coal plants open in West Virginia, Ohio, North Carolina and Kentucky.Trump declared coal essential to U.S. national and economic security last April. He issued several executive orders at the time that aimed boost coal production. The coal industry has been in state of decline for years as it has struggled to compete against natural gas and renewable energy. About 16% of U.S. electricity generation came from burning coal in 2023, down from 51% in 2001, according to the Energy Information Administration. ",

Pramila Jayapal's history of searches of the Department of Justice's database of documents related to the notorious sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.Photos of a black binder that Bondi had at the hearing showed the words \"Jayapal Pramila Search History\" and a list of documents whose numbers coincide with the number of Epstein files.Jayapal, a Washington state Democrat who sits on the Judiciary Committee, and other members of Congress have visited the DOJ in recent days to view documents related to Epstein that are not available to the public. Jayapal blasted Bondi in a post on X on Wednesday evening.\"It is totally inappropriate and against the separations of powers for the DOJ to surveil us as we search the Epstein files,\" Jayapal wrote.\"Bondi showed up today with a burn book that held a printed search history of exactly what emails I searched,\" the congresswoman said.\"That is outrageous and I intend to pursue this and stop this spying on members.\"House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., when asked by MS Now if Bondi's alleged action was appropriate, at first said, \"I'm not going to comment on an allegation that is unsubstantiated. I don't know anything about it.\"\"I haven't seen or heard anything about that, but that would be inappropriate if it happened,\" Johnson said.U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi holds a piece of paper labelled \"Jayapal Pramila Search History\", in reference to U.S. Representative Pramila Jayapal (D-WA), a member of the House Judiciary Committee, during the committee's hearing on oversight of the Justice Department, on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C., U.S., Feb. 11, 2026. Kent Nishimura | ReutersJayapal earlier during Wednesday's hearing had a contentious exchange with Bondi after asking survivors of Epstein's abuse — who were in the room — to stand and indicate if they had been unable to meet with the DOJ.Multiple women stood and raised their hands. \"I'm not gonna get in the gutter for her theatrics,\" Bondi said when Jayapal asked her to apologize to the victims for the DOJ's failure to fully redact their names when the files were released to the public.Read more CNBC politics coverageWatch Pam Bondi hearing: AG touts record Dow as Democrats grill her over Trump, EpsteinTrump Canada tariffs face House vote after Republican leaders fail to block rebellionThese Democrats aren’t ready to jettison big business as party stalwarts shift leftDC grand jury declines to indict Sens.

So they could essentially surveil members to see what we were gonna ask her about?\" Jayapal told the news outlet.The DOJ did not immediately respond to CNBC when asked if Bondi had a printout of the congresswoman's search history, why she might have had it, or if the DOJ kept track of searches by other members of Congress.",

    "body": "A recruiter displays information while speaking to a jobseeker during the WorkSource North Seattle Career Fair in Seattle, Washington, US, on Tuesday, Feb. 10, 2026.David Ryder | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesJanuary job gains were better than anything the U.S. economy saw in 2025 but not still enough to sound an all-clear on what has otherwise been a stagnant labor market.With a gain of 130,000 nonfarm payrolls and the unemployment rate slipping to 4.3%, the lowest since August, the numbers indicated that hiring is at least hanging in there while layoffs appear contained.However, beneath the hood there were some trouble spots: A continued concentration in just a few fields where hiring is happening; revisions that meant virtually no gains in the second half of 2025, and questions over what happens from here as companies contend with a high level of uncertainty.\"I would anticipate that for the rest of the year, job growth is going to be quite subdued,\" said Gregory Daco, chief economist at EY-Parthenon. \"Whether it's as subdued as 2025 ... is still an open question. But I would not expect job growth to be higher than 50,000 for the remainder of 2026.\"Indeed, revisions the Bureau of Labor Statistics released Wednesday put job gains last year at just 15,000 a month. The last six months of the year produced a net loss of 1,000 jobs. In the recent words of Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller, the year's job growth was close to \"Zero. Zip. Nada.\"Also, nearly all the January jobs came from health care-related sectors, raising questions over the ability of displaced and new workers to be able to get hired. On top of the anemic gains, Daco has another worry. He sees trouble brewing with the receding income gains for cash-strapped consumers possibly causing damage not readily visible in headline economic numbers.Average hourly earnings advanced 0.4% in January, slightly higher than expected, but the annual gain of 3.71% was the lowest since July 2024. With retail sales unexpectedly flat in December, and consumer spending responsible for more than two-thirds of all U.S. economic activity, that could spell a potential danger sign.\"We're heading from a jobless expansion to potentially an income-less expansion, because income is essentially the combination of jobs and wages. With both under pressure, that means that for many families, income and income growth prospects are muted,\" Daco said.Questions for the futureSo while the monthly numbers are good, whether they are an outlier, or even if they will stand up, remains to be seen. After all, every month in 2025 saw a negative revision from the initial estimate. The release comes with other economic signs looking strong. Gross domestic product, the broadest measure of growth, is on pace to post a solid 3.7% gain in the fourth quarter after posting 4.4% and 3.8% increases in the prior two periods in 2025, according to the Atlanta Fed.However, that kind of growth is hard to sustain without stronger job gains, said Rick Rieder, chief investment officer for fixed income at BlackRock.\"One key warning sign is that in past cycles, GDP growth like this has usually required far more hiring. The fact that hiring has slowed while growth has advanced may potentially be an early signal of a productivity boom that we expect to continue,\" Rieder said in a note. \"While areas like healthcare are still labor intensive, the more interest-sensitive parts of the economy are clearly still under pressure, particularly the lower income segment.\"The state of the labor market and its relation to inflation sets up a policy challenge at the Federal Reserve, which already has seen significant divisions over how to proceed.Most recently, regional Presidents Lorie Logan of Dallas and Beth Hammack of Cleveland said Tuesday that they don't see a need to cut rates further with inflation still above the Fed's target and the labor market stable. As voters this year on the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee, their positions conflict with those of Governor Waller, who is advocating for more cuts, a position also held by Fed Chair-designate Kevin Warsh.\"I think there is room for the Fed to get a little bit closer to median estimates of neutral policy,\" EY's Daco said. \"I don't necessarily think that that will be the case ... in part because a majority of Fed policy makers are more focused on the inflation mandate than on the employment mandate.\"For their part, markets took the view Wednesday that the January payrolls report will temper any urges to cut rates soon. According to the CME Group's FedWatch tracker, trades are pricing in the likelihood of a cut in March at roughly 6%, though they still see two reductions before the end of the year.",

    "body": "Jobseekers speak with recruiters past event signage during the WorkSource North Seattle Career Fair in Seattle, Washington, US, on Tuesday, Feb. 10, 2026. David Ryder | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesThe January nonfarm payrolls report beat Wall Street expectations in both job creation and the unemployment rate. Here are the top five takeaways:From a headline perspective, the news was good. Nonfarm payrolls rose by 130,000 and the unemployment rate fell to 4.3%, the latter thanks to a boom of 528,000 in household employment. The Dow Jones consensus was for 55,000 jobs and a 4.4% unemployment rate.Wages also rose, climbing a higher-than-expected 0.4% for the month and 3.7% annually. Hours worked, a productivity gauge, increased to 34.3 hours, up by 0.1 hour.Along with the sunshine came some rain. Annual revisions to the jobs count benchmarked against Census data showed that for the April 2024-March 2025 period, payrolls growth was 898,000 lower than initially stated. Moreover, November's previous estimate fell by 15,000 and December was off 2,000. For the final six months of 2025, the economy lost a net 1,000 jobs.Payroll growth again was concentrated in health care-related fields: There were 82,000 jobs in ambulatory health-care services, hospitals, and nursing and residential care facilities, and another 42,000 in social assistance. Only construction, which added 33,000 positions, showed any noticeable improvement.Traders increased their bets that the strong headline payrolls number and decline in the unemployment rate would keep the Federal Reserve on the sidelines until the summer. Futures market trading implied just an 8% probability of a cut in March, with the next reduction not likely happening until at least June, according to the CME Group's FedWatch gauge.They said it:\"Just in: GREAT JOBS NUMBERS, FAR GREATER THAN EXPECTED! The United States of America should be paying MUCH LESS on its Borrowings (BONDS!). We are again the strongest Country in the World, and should therefore be paying the LOWEST INTEREST RATE, by far. This would be an INTEREST COST SAVINGS OF AT LEAST ONE TRILLION DOLLARS PER YEAR - BALANCED BUDGET, PLUS. WOW! The Golden Age of America is upon us!!!\" — President Donald Trump, in a Truth Social post\"The strong payrolls print in January may be somewhat exaggerated: construction payrolls jumped, sensitive to warmer January weather; healthcare payrolls were well above trend; and retail stabilized. The  underlying pace for private payrolls is probably closer to 50k per month after accounting for the temporary strength in those areas, close to the recent pace.\" — Michael Gapen, Morgan Stanley chief economist\"The strong jobs growth in January assuages some concerns around the softening labor market and supports the outlook for consumption. But we'll need to see more data to determine whether January is a brief deviation from an overall trend or a reversal of the weakening employment outlook.\" — Atsi Sheth, Moody's Ratings chief credit officerCorrection: The previous December estimate was off by 2,000. An earlier version misstated the figure.",

President Donald Trump first levied the duties in April 2025 with an across-the-board rate on all goods and services entering the U.S. along with a menu of so-called reciprocal tariffs on individual countries. Since then, the White House has been negotiating with its trading partners, backing off on some of the more aggressive charges while maintaining tough talk on issues.Last November, the Supreme Court heard oral arguments challenging the auspices under which Trump justified the tariffs. The decision was expected in January. The high court hasn't ruled yet, and there's concern in the White House that a negative ruling could force the U.S. into reimbursing the duties collected so far.The tariffs helped put a dent in the pace of the budget deficit.In the fourth month of the fiscal year, the shortfall totaled roughly $95 billion, down about 26% from the same period a year ago, the Treasury Department reported Year to date, that put federal red ink at $697 billion, or down 17% from the same period of fiscal 2025, according to numbers not adjusted for calendar. Calendar adjustments put the deficit reduction at 21%. Interest on the $38.6 trillion U.S. debt continues to be a burden on the national finances. Net interest paid totaled $76 billion for the month, more than all other expenditures except Medicare, Social Security and health care. Year to date, gross interest has totaled $426.5 billion, up from $392.2 billion the year before.",

In the year-ago period, its domestic same-store sales shrank 1.4% after an E. coli outbreak weeks into the quarter weighed on traffic. McDonald's credited buzzy promotions — like its Grinch Meal and Monopoly promotion — that boosted both traffic and sales this year. For nearly a week, McDonald's was the largest seller of socks in the world, thanks to the popularity of the Grinch Meal, which included the special-edition clothing item in many of its markets. Kempczinski said the company sold 50 million pairs globally in the first few days of the promotion. It was also the catalyst for McDonald's highest-ever sales day, according to Chief Financial Officer Ian Borden. The chain also expanded its value offerings by relaunching Extra Value Meals, which offer a roughly 15% discount on combo meals.Outside the U.S., McDonald's saw same-store sales growth in nearly all markets. The company's international operated markets segment, which includes Germany and Australia, reported same-store sales growth of 5.2%. Its international developmental licensed markets division saw same-store sales rise 4.5%.Looking to 2026, McDonald's is \"off to a strong start,\" according to Borden. But executives expect weaker first-quarter same-store sales growth compared with the fourth quarter. While Extra Value Meals are drawing in diners, the winter storm that swept across the country in late January scared some away and caused temporary restaurant closures.For the full year, McDonald's is planning to spend between $3.7 billion and $3.9 billion on capital expenditures, according to a regulatory filing. Most of that will be spent opening approximately 2,600 new locations. The addition of 2,100 net new restaurants is expected to raise systemwide sales about 2.5%, excluding currency fluctuations. McDonald's plans to open about 750 restaurants in the U.S. and its international operated markets, while licensees and affiliates will open more than 1,800 restaurants in other markets.\"We believe the underlying assumptions for our 2026 outlook are prudent and reflect our expectations that the [quick-service restaurant] industry environments in the U.S. and across many markets will remain challenging,\" Borden said. The chain also has big plans for its menu in 2026. Later this year, McDonald's will roll out new beverages, including energy drinks, fruity refreshers and crafted sodas in the U.S. and select international markets. The new drinks are the result of lessons learned from its now-shuttered CosMc's spinoff and a 500-restaurant test that took place last summer. Like Taco Bell and Chick-fil-A, McDonald's is hoping that fun drinks will attract diners and lift sales.The chain has also been leaning into chicken, which is more popular with U.S. consumers than beef. Recently, several Chicago-area locations began testing hand-breaded chicken strips, wings and grilled sandwiches. Still, the experiment is still in the early stages, Global Chief Restaurant Experience Officer Jill McDonald said on the company's conference call.Longer term, McDonald's is also looking to add menu items that would interest diners who are using GLP-1 drugs, McDonald said. Plus, the chain will highlight the high protein content of its existing menu.\"We'll be led by the customers and what they what they want from us, but there's plenty [for] them to enjoy on our menu currently,\" she said.",

    "body": "Information on Zhipu's AI service on the web, dubbed Z.ai, arranged on a computer in Shanghai, Jan. 7, 2026.Raul Ariano | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesChinese artificial intelligence stocks rallied Thursday as several companies unveiled upgraded models and top policymakers renewed calls for a broader adoption of the technology. Hong Kong-listed Zhipu AI — that trades as Knowledge Atlas Technology — surged 30% after releasing its GLM-5, an open-source large-language model with enhanced coding capabilities and long-running agent tasks. The company said the model approaches Anthropic's Claude Opus 4.5 in coding benchmarks while surpassing Google's Gemini 3 Pro on some tests. CNBC could not verify those claims. MiniMax saw shares in Hong Kong jump 11% following Wednesday's launch of its updated M2.5 open-source model with enhanced AI agent tools, on its overseas website. The company describes M2 as \"a model built for Max coding & agentic workflows.\" The rally comes amid intensifying competition in AI as Chinese developers race to match U.S. rivals with a flurry of new model and agent releases. DeepSeek, which took the world by storm last year, also upgraded its flagship AI model on Wednesday, adding support for a larger context window and more up-to-date knowledge, according to a report from the South China Morning Post. Ant Group also released its open-source AI model, Ming-Flash-Omni 2.0, on Wednesday. The \"unified multimodal model\" is capable of generating speech, music, sound effects and visuals.The releases also lifted investor sentiment on suppliers to AI companies. Shanghai-listed shares of UCloud Tech that provides computing support for Zhipu, surged by 20% to hit the daily limit.  SenseTime, which has shifted its focus from developing facial recognition surveillance technology to providing AI software platforms, saw its shares in Hong Kong jump 5%.    The Shanghai STAR AI Industry Index climbed 1.7% before paring gains.

    "body": "HUZHOU, CHINA - JANUARY 27: An employee works on the beverage production line to meet the Spring Festival market demand at Leyuan Health Technology (Huzhou) Co., Ltd. on January 27, 2026 in Huzhou, Zhejiang Province of China.  Wang Shucheng | Visual China Group | Getty ImagesA year after U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs spooked exporters and customers, Chinese factories and ports are buzzing with activity ahead of the Lunar New Year — even pushing freight rates higher.Chinese factory activity typically surges at the start of the year with manufacturers racing to fulfil orders and ship out goods before the country enters an extended holiday for the Chinese New Year. This year's pre-holiday rush appears as strong as ever despite Trump tariffs. Renaud Anjoran, founder and CEO of Agilian Technology, a Guangdong-based electronics manufacturer, said his factory was operating at nearly full capacity after a year of stop-start tariff threats: \"We are very busy.\" \"It's back to the situation where it's like tariffs don't exist. American customers are not thinking of [buying from] other places,\" Anjoran said, adding that some clients had to pay additional costs to have goods made and shipped out before the holiday.   His plant in the city of Dongguan ships more than half its products to the U.S., maintaining exports at levels seen before Trump's imposition of tariffs last year.   \"Factories saw orders, production and earnings jump ahead of the Chinese New Year holidays,\" according to China Beige Book that tracks economic data from the world's second largest economy. The research firm estimates that in January, industrial output jumped compared to a year ago, with both domestic and export orders \"accelerating sharply on-year and on-month.\" The official reading on output for January and February will be out in March.  Major ports in China handled 40% more containers during the week ended Feb. 1 from a year earlier, according to a team of transport and logistics analysts at HSBC Bank. That marks the fastest year-on-year growth in more than 12 months and well above the average weekly growth of about 10% in 2025. Take the ports in Ningbo, one of China's most critical maritime hubs: Terminals operated \"beyond capacity, with individual vessels overbooked by more than 20%, and container gate-in has been suspended,\" said Jay Guo, dean at Ningbo China Institute for Supply Chain Innovation. Unmanned trucks transport containers at Dapukou Container Terminal in Zhoushan Port, Ningbo, Zhejiang, China, on December 9, 2025. Nurphoto | Nurphoto | Getty ImagesRising transportation costsSevere traffic congestion has pushed trucking rates up by 80%, Guo said, noting that many factories and freight forwarders will halt operations from Friday and resume next Thursday.  \"CNY-focused advisories for shippers in Europe, North America, and Asia report a clear pre-holiday pull-forward of bookings from China,\" said Wolfgang Lehmacher, a global supply chain and logistics expert.   That said, the spike was also in part thanks to the low-base effects from the timing of the Lunar New Year, which is in mid-February this year, versus late January in 2025.  The surge in activity, driven by pre-holiday front-loading, has pushed up freight prices. The Shanghai Containerized Freight Index, a key benchmark for container freight rates from Shanghai to major global destinations, was floating in the range of 1,400 to 1,656, in early January compared with the average level over the past 15 years of 1,337 to 1,568, according to HSBC's freight monitor report released Monday. Rates hit a peak three weeks earlier than the historical pattern suggests, signaling the pre-holiday front-loading being pulled forward this year, HSBC analysts said in its note.  Large container shipments to the U.S. were running above levels during the same period in 2024 and 2025 for most part of January and into February, the HSBC freight report showed. Air freight rates for lanes to the U.S. and Europe were higher than a year earlier. The Baltic Exchange's Shanghai Pudong outbound index was up 5.3% during the week ended Feb. 2 from the previous week.  Companies are also moving ahead with developing new products as tariff tensions have ebbed. Following a high-level meeting in October, China secured a one-year trade truce with Washington that kept tariffs on its goods to the U.S. at a lower level. For most part of 2025, China had reduced its direct shipments to America while ramping up exports to alternative markets including Southeast Asia and European countries.De-risking, not decoupling The buzz in Chinese factories comes despite companies looking to diversify their supply chains. Many multinational firms are accelerating the \"China-plus-one\" sourcing strategies in Southeast Asia and near-shoring in markets such as Mexico and parts of Europe, but they continue to maintain significant production or sourcing in China, said Lehmacher.    Not surprisingly, factory floors in China have been bustling with customers visiting from around the world as they place orders for the next production cycle, Cameron Johnson, a Shanghai-based senior partner at business consultancy Tidalwave Solutions, told CNBC after visiting several factories across southern China last month. Automotive, consumer and sporting goods manufacturers in southern China, were \"fairly busy,\" Johnson said, as they work through backlogs and field inquiries from foreign buyers, including some from the U.S.  They waited as long as they can for the uncertainty to stop but now they have to figure out how to move forward.Cameron JohnsonSenior partner, Tidalwave SolutionsThe visits follows a turbulent year owed to Trump's sweeping tariffs that led to a wave of panic buying and sudden freezes as companies struggled with trade uncertainty, playing a stop-and-go game with orders. Business owners \"waited as long as they can for the uncertainty to stop but now they have to figure out how to move forward,\" Johnson said. Interests from American customers about developing new products has recovered significantly since then, said Anjoran. \"A lot of people had new products in mind but froze the projects because of the uncertainty,\" he said. \"Now it seems things are relatively stable.\" — CNBC's Evelyn Cheng contributed to the report.",

    "body": "U.S. President Donald Trump (R) meets with Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney in the Oval Office of the White House on October 07, 2025 in Washington, DC.Anna Moneymaker | Getty ImagesThe House on Wednesday passed a resolution disapproving of President Donald Trump's tariffs against Canada, a blow to Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., and a rare Republican rebuke of the president's signature economic policy.The resolution cleared the House 219-211, with several Republicans crossing the aisle to support it. One Democrat, Rep. Jared Golden of Maine, voted against the measure.The tariff resolution, introduced by Rep. Gregory Meeks, D-N.Y., was considered a day after a procedural vote on a rule that would have barred House challenges to Trump's tariffs failed with the support of three Republican members.Trump warned Republicans during the vote that there would be consequences for overriding him on tariffs. \"Any Republican, in the House or the Senate, that votes against TARIFFS will seriously suffer the consequences come Election time, and that includes Primaries!\" Trump posted to his TRUTH social account during the vote. \"TARIFFS have given us Economic and National Security, and no Republican should be responsible for destroying this privilege.\"The risk was worth it for some Republicans, especially those in swing districts where tariffs are deeply unpopular. Rep. Don Bacon, R-Neb., who is retiring at the end of his term and voted for the anti-tariff resolution, told reporters earlier in the day that the White House tried and failed to flip his vote. \"I voted on principle,\" Bacon said of a Tuesday procedural vote that allowed the measure to proceed. \"They were trying to do sweeteners for Nebraska, but I said what about the other 49 states?\" The Democratic side of the House chamber erupted in cheers when the resolution passed.

Kelly, Slotkin for seditious conspiracy: MS Now\"The Speaker continues to abdicate his responsibilities, ceding Congress's Article I authority to Donald Trump,\" Meeks, the top Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said in a statement posted to X on Tuesday. \"Republicans now face a clear choice: go on the record and join Democrats in ending these cost-raising tariffs, or keep forcing American families to pay for them.\"The measure now heads to the Senate, which approved similar resolutions last year. \"Congress has spoken with bipartisan clarity: it's time to give Americans relief and end Trump's tariff tax,\" said Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y. \"This price-spiking tariff tax is raising costs on everything from groceries prices to energy bills — all because Trump chose chaos over common sense. It's time to deliver relief.\"The vote on Trump's tariffs forced House Republicans to choose between loyalty to the president and striking down economic policy that many in the GOP conference do not like.Reps. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., Kevin Kiley, R-Calif., and Don Bacon, R-Neb., bucked Trump and GOP leaders on Tuesday by voting with every Democrat to defeat a rule that would have blocked House votes on Trump's tariffs through July 31.\"I don't like putting the important work of the House on pause, but Congress needs to be able to debate on tariffs. Tariffs have been a 'net negative' for the economy and are a significant tax that American consumers, manufacturers, and farmers are paying,\" Bacon posted to X after the Tuesday vote.Because of the razor-thin GOP majority in the House, Johnson can afford to lose only one Republican vote if all Democrats are present and vote in favor of the resolution to end Trump's Canada tariff.Still, the effort is likely symbolic. Even if the Senate approves Meeks' resolution, Trump would likely veto the legislation.\"This is life with a razor-thin majority,\" Johnson said in a Wednesday morning appearance on Fox Business. \"I think it's a big mistake. I don't think we need to go down the road of trying to limit the president's power while he is in the midst of negotiating America-first trade agreements with nations around the world.\"",

David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesEssilorLuxottica's more than tripled its Meta artificial intelligence glasses sales last year, the Ray-Ban maker said on Wednesday in its fourth-quarter results. The French-Italian eyewear brand said it sold over 7 million AI glasses last year.That's up from the 2 million that the company sold in 2023 and 2024 combined, according to its quarterly report last February. The figure reported Wednesday includes smart glasses sold under the brands for Ray-Ban and Oakley, the latter of which was unveiled in June. The company's smart glasses success is the latest sign that the adoption of wearable AI devices is gaining momentum with consumers. \"Our success in wearables is helping to propel the AI-glasses revolution, with our iconic brands being a powerful driver of demand,\" the company said in a release.EssilorLuxottica has been working on the wearable devices with the social media company since 2019, CNBC reported at the time. The two companies launched the first edition of the glasses in September 2021, but the device didn't gain widespread attention until the second-generation launch in 2023. In September, EssilorLuxottica and Meta introduced a new Ray-Ban iteration, controllable through hand gestures and neural technology. That device retails for $799 and features a small display in one of the lenses. Meta in January said it would pushback the international launch of the Ray-Ban Display glasses, originally slated for early 2026, due to \"unprecedented\" demand in the U.S.Last month, Bloomberg reported that Meta and EssilorLuxottica were discussing doubling production to at least 20 million by the end of this year to meet growing demand. Meta has indicated its commitment to working with the glasses maker and extended a long-term partnership agreement to \"collaborate into the next decade\" in 2024.WATCH: New Mexico AG Raul Torrez: Meta has created a space for predators to target and exploit childrenwatch now",

Gelernter lost the use of his right hand from the explosion.Yale's action against the professor comes nearly three months after former Harvard University President Larry Summers said he was stepping back from all public commitments because of fallout over the release of emails between him and Epstein.The correspondence included Summers seeking guidance from Epstein about pursuing a romantic relationship with a woman he described as a mentee, the Harvard Crimson newspaper reported at the time.Summers, who is also a former U.S. Treasury secretary, took a leave from teaching classes at Harvard, as well as from his post as the director of Mossavar-Rahmani Center for Business and Government at the Harvard Kennedy School.\"I am deeply ashamed of my actions and recognize the pain they have caused. I take full responsibility for my misguided decision to continue communicating with Mr. Epstein,\" Summers said in a statement obtained by CNBC at the time.Harvard said in November that it would investigate Summers' relationship with Epstein in light of the disclosure by Congress of emails between them.Epstein killed himself in a federal jail in New York City in August 2019, weeks after being arrested on child sex trafficking charges.",

    "body": "SpaceX CEO Elon Musk during the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Jan. 22, 2026.Bloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesSpaceX CEO Elon Musk on Wednesday announced that the company's xAI artificial intelligence venture implemented a reorganization that \"required parting ways with some people.\"The overhaul was done \"to improve speed of execution,\" Musk said in a post on X. He did not say which employees may have been cut as a result of the restructuring or which employees may have resigned of their own volition.\"We are hiring aggressively,\" Musk added. Earlier this week, xAI co-founders Jimmy Ba and Tony Wu announced their exits after several other founding members, including Igor Babuschkin, Kyle Kosic, Christian Szegedy and Greg Yang, previously departed.Last week, Musk announced a record-setting, all-stock transaction in which SpaceX, the aerospace and defense juggernaut, acquired xAI, which owns and operates social network X and is the developer of Grok, the embattled AI chatbot and image generator. The deal valued SpaceX at $1 trillion and xAI at $250 billion post merger, according to documents viewed by CNBC. Musk previously used xAI to acquire X, formerly Twitter, in another all-stock transaction announced in March 2025.The co-founder departures and the reorganization this week come as SpaceX prepares to go public sometime this year and while xAI faces regulatory probes in multiple jurisdictions across Europe, Asia and the U.S.The probes are looking into whether xAI violated regional regulations after Grok enabled mass-creation and syndication of non-consensual, explicit images, colloquially known as deepfake porn. The images were based on photos of real people, including children.Musk launched xAI in 2023 alongside 11 other people in an effort to compete against OpenAI and Google. The company's stated goal was to \"understand the true nature of the universe,\" according to its website at the time. WATCH: Calculating Elon Musk's wealth: Here's what to knowwatch now",

    "body": "Nio cars are seen displayed at Nio House, at the Chinese electric vehicle (EV) maker's manufacturing hub in Hefei, Anhui province, China April 2, 2025. Florence Lo | ReutersDETROIT — The largest U.S. auto dealer isn't interested in selling vehicles from China-based brands domestically right now, its CEO said Wednesday.But it's not necessarily because of politics, logistics or potential consumer backlash, according to Lithia Motors CEO Bryan DeBoer. His company already has at least 10 stores selling vehicles from three Chinese companies in the United Kingdom.DeBoer, who has grown Lithia exponentially in recent years, said the potential cost, return-on-investment and needed infrastructure, largely due to franchise rules in the U.S., are the biggest hindrances right now.\"We're quite excited that we've got that opportunity in the United Kingdom, but there's a big fundamental difference,\" DeBoer told investors Wednesday, citing \"dueling of franchises\" practices in the U.K. that allow Lithia to offer brands from different companies in the same showroom if they're deemed competitors.DeBoer said the dealer can be allowed to put vehicles from a company such as China's Chery Automobile, which is growing in Europe, into an existing showroom in the UK, and it would cost less than $100,000.That's not the case for the U.S., where franchised dealer laws are strict, vary by state and companies can have more influence in, if not rules against, such decisions. His comments come as Chinese automotive brands are increasingly exporting and expanding outside of their home market. Global market share for Chinese brands has jumped nearly 70% in five years, and many experts see a threat to U.S. automakers, including the anticipated entrance of Chinese brands into America. There have been China-produced vehicles on sale in the U.S. from brands such as Buick and Volvo, but none are from Chinese brands such as BYD, Nio or others.In the U.S., Lithia would need to establish new retail locations and service operations to support sales of Chinese brands, which would mean having to make completely new investments. He noted that roughly 50% to 60% of the company's profits come from service and parts. \"I think we would probably not be early adopters when it comes to the United States or possibly even Canada, primarily because we're usually not in a dual franchise situation,\" he said. China's most recent announced expansion is to Canada, a relatively small vehicle market that removed 100% tariffs on imported vehicles from China amid a trade dispute with the Trump administration.But DeBoer said the Oregon-based company isn't completely shutting the door, as Chinese brands continue to grow globally.\"We do have building relationships with a number of Chinese brands,\" he said. \"We'll keep our minds open and look at what the opportunities that present us in the future.\"DeBoer comments occurred on the company's call to discuss its fourth-quarter and year-end earnings, which included annual increases of 4% in revenue and 3.1% in gross profit.",

Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., slammed her and the Department of Justice for the lack of indictments of possible co-conspirators of the convicted sex predator Epstein.The S&P 500 is also up and the Nasdaq is \"smashing records,\" while Americans' retirement accounts are \"booming,\" Bondi said after celebrating the Dow Jones Industrial Average's gains. \"That's what we should be talking about.\"Democrats balked at the rhetoric, but Bondi doubled down.Read more CNBC politics coverageWatch Pam Bondi hearing: AG touts record Dow as Democrats grill her over Trump, EpsteinTrump Canada tariffs face House vote after Republican leaders fail to block rebellionThese Democrats aren’t ready to jettison big business as party stalwarts shift leftDC grand jury declines to indict Sens. Kelly, Slotkin for seditious conspiracy: MS Now\"What does the Dow have to do with anything? That's what they just asked. Are you kidding?\" she said as Judiciary Chairman Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, banged a gavel and called for order in the hearing room.Trump has repeatedly cited stock market gains as a barometer for his presidency after being elected to a second term amid voter concerns about rising prices for consumer goods. The Dow closed above 50,000 for the first time on Friday and added to that record each day this week.The DOJ oversight hearing had already devolved into partisan shouting matches on multiple occasions prior to Bondi's references to the stock market.Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md., the panel's ranking member, in his opening remarks accused Bondi of \"running a massive Epstein cover-up right out of the Department of Justice.\"Raskin pointed to the DOJ's failure to release millions of files that it is legally bound to disclose under the Epstein Files Transparency Act, which Trump signed into law in November after reversing his opposition to the bill.The lawmaker also slammed the DOJ for redacting the names of alleged Epstein co-conspirators and enablers in the records it did release, while failing to black out victims' identifying information.\"So you ignored the law, and even with over 100,000 employees at your disposal, you acted with some mixture of staggering incompetence, cold indifference and jaded cruelty towards more than 1,000 victims, raped, abused and trafficked,\" Raskin said. \"This performance screams cover-up.\"Rep. Pramila Jayapal of Washington, the first Democratic member to question Bondi, asked a group of Epstein survivors in the hearing room to stand up and raise their hands if they had been unable to meet with the DOJ. After numerous women stood and all raised their hands, Jayapal asked Bondi to apologize for the \"unacceptable release\" of victims' information in the Epstein files.Bondi began to respond that former Attorney General Merrick Garland \"sat in this chair twice,\" at which point the congresswoman interrupted and pushed her to answer the question, and a back-and-forth ensued.\"I'm not gonna get in the gutter for her theatrics,\" Bondi said.More acrimonious exchanges followed as Bondi and Democrats continued to clash.After Nadler's speaking time expired, Bondi admonished the Democrats who participated in the impeachment hearings against Trump during his first administration, saying, \"You all should be apologizing.\"\"You sit here and you attack the president, and I am not going to have it. I'm not going to put up with it,\" Bondi said.Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., a co-sponsor of the Epstein files bill, laced into Bondi as he called the DOJ's redaction issues a \"massive failure.\"He homed in on redactions that obscured the name of Les Wexner, the former CEO of Victoria's Secret, \"as a co-conspirator in an FBI document.\"Bondi said that redaction was corrected \"within 40 minutes.\" Massie shot back, \"40 minutes of me catching you red-handed.\"Bondi said Massie has \"Trump derangement syndrome.\"",

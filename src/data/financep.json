    "body": "In 2019, Chanel Rivers took a trip to London that would change the entire trajectory of her life.Born and raised in New York, Rivers, now 35, says she was tired of the dating scene and worrying about her safety in the Big Apple. She booked a trip to London with a friend and realized how comfortable she felt walking around the city, something she no longer felt in New York.\"I remember just walking around London and being like, 'I feel like this is where I'm supposed to be.' It was a feeling that came over me,\" Rivers says. \"In London, I just feel like my anxiety has lessened a lot, which is great.\"Shortly after Rivers got back to New York, she started figuring out how to return to London permanently, but the Covid-19 pandemic brought her plans to a complete halt. During the pandemic, Rivers met her now fiancé, Martin, an architect from Canada who was living and working in New York.Rivers was born and raised in New York.Chanel RiversAfter four and a half years of dating, Rivers brought up moving to London again to her fiancé. She admits that the feeling of wanting to move didn't go away, and she didn't see herself being in New York long-term anymore.\"I considered Canada, and we did look at Vancouver, but it was not city enough for me. Being from New York, I needed a big city. London was always the plan for me in my heart,\" she says.Around the same time that Rivers brought up getting the move to London going, her fiancé's job offered him a position in their office there. It was something she says was \"very serendipitous but meant to be.\"Since Martin was already a U.K. citizen, Rivers only needed to apply for a partner visa, which was approved in March 2024.Chanel is part of small but growing trend of Americans relocating to the U.K. More than 6,000 U.S. citizens applied to either become British subjects or to live and work in the country indefinitely from March 2024 to March 2025, the most since the U.K.'s Home Office began keeping records in 2004, according to The Guardian.Hello, LondonIn October 2024, the couple moved into a two-bedroom, one-bathroom apartment with a private garden in West London without ever seeing it in person. The rent was 2,400 pounds or USD $3,159 when they first moved in and has since increased to 2,515.20 pounds or $3,311, according to documents reviewed by CNBC Make It.The apartment was unfurnished, in a townhouse rather than a larger building, and didn't have a doorman, unlike the modern one they lived in back in New York City. The couple didn't ship any of their furniture over because it was too expensive. The first night they spent in the apartment, they slept in sleeping bags on the floor and used their suitcases as a dining table.\"We wanted something with character. We told ourselves we wanted something different when we moved here and we wanted something that felt very London so that we had a different living experience than we did in the U.S.,\" Rivers says.Rivers, her fiancé and their dog moved to London in October 2024.Chanel RiversRivers was able to keep her $120,000 a year job in event planning and marketing through the end of 2024.After that, she started looking for a position in London, which she says helped her explore the city as she traveled for interviews and worked out of local coffee shops. Rivers says she never had homesickness or regretted the move, but she admits that she was still nervous about being in a new city. \"I was so intimidated by London because it's so big and I was kind of scared to go out on my own. I don't know what happened to that brave girl from 2019, but I guess everything just felt so real now, and it was hitting me,\" she adds.One year later and the cost of living in LondonNow that Rivers and her fiancé have lived in London for a little over a year, they have settled in nicely, she says. Rivers found a London-based job working as an event planner. Rivers did not want to disclose her salary, but says that although she did take a pay cut, she's happy with it and spends less money than she did while living in New York. \"I've found that I generally spend less now, mostly because I'm not socializing as much as I did in New York. In London, life is a bit quieter but in a good way,\" she says. \"I still make time to see new friends and meet new people but I go out less. Plus, since I earn less here, I'm more mindful about where my money goes.\"Rivers and her fiancé also split their expenses proportionally based on their incomes. \"My fiancé makes the equivalent of what he made in the U.S., so he's kind of carrying the team right now, which is great,\" she adds.Rivers and her fiancé moved into an apartment without seeing it in person.Chanel RiversRivers' share of the monthly living expenses breakdown is as follows, according to documents reviewed by CNBC Make It:Rent = 1,215 pounds or $1,599Cellphone = 49.70 pounds or $65Internet/Wi-Fi = 20 pounds or $26Water = 59.78 pounds or $79Electricity = 121 pounds or $159Groceries = 300 pounds or $395Transportation = 115 pounds or $151Amazon Prime = 8.99 pounds or $12Pet insurance = 25.21 pounds or $33Apple TV = $12.99Rivers' biggest monthly expenses are rent, groceries and electricity, she says. She commutes to the office three times a week and tends to buy lunch on those days. Since moving to London, Rivers and her fiancé say they have also been able to take advantage of the city's location by taking local day trips on the train and traveling to Ireland and Mallorca. \"It's really nice to have easier access to traveling. I feel like in the U.S., you go on a trip once a year and that's it. It's nice that we can hop on a train and go to Paris for a night or hop on a plane and go to Spain,\" she says. \"The traveling is also a big part of why we wanted to move. Despite it taking a while to get settled, Rivers says she feels they made the right decision.\"I've only felt like this is the right path and where I'm supposed to be. Even the mundane things I do here excite me,\" she says. \"I feel like I'm probably in a honeymoon phase but I feel every day that I made the right choice. I don't think I see myself living in the U.S. now that I know what it's like to live a lifestyle outside of that.\"Rivers says she doesn't see herself moving back to the U.S.Chanel RiversRivers says moving back to the U.S. probably isn't in the cards for her, but she could eventually get on board with moving to Canada after living out her London dream for a few more years. \"Canada wasn't as exciting for where I'm at in life right now. I wanted something a little bit more exciting, like New York, but different. I think when I get older, if we were to move back and we wanted to be closer to family, then Canada would be the place we move to,\" she says.Conversions from British Pounds to USD were done using the OANDA conversion rate of 0.76 pounds to $1 USD on Nov. 11, 2025.

    "body": "Coffee prices were already rising following poor harvests last year when the U.S. added new tariffs on coffee imports in April. Those tariffs have since been rolled back, but prices at grocery stores and cafés are still high, leaving many shoppers wondering why a simple cup of coffee costs so much.As of September, roasted coffee sold in stores cost about 41% more than it did 12 months prior, rising from an average of $6.47 to $9.14 per pound, according to the most recent Bureau of Labor Statistics data.While prices can swing by roughly a dollar within a year during volatile periods, the nearly $3 increase in the most recent BLS data is unusually steep — and consumers are taking notice.\"This is ridiculous,\" 52-year-old Chuck Smith said in a TikTok video in August in which he showed receipts for the 38.2-ounce tub of Maxwell House ground coffee he buys at his local Walmart in Indiana, which had nearly doubled in price to $21.44 in under a year.Smith says he filmed the clip spontaneously in the grocery aisle after noticing the price hike. \"It was just me in the moment,\" he told CNBC Make It, adding that the reaction \"captured what a lot of folks are feeling.\" Walmart and Kraft Heinz, the maker of Maxwell House, did not respond to requests for comment. Other brands, including Nespresso and Folgers, have also increased prices in the last year.Restaurant coffee prices have risen, too: The average cost of a regular cup increased from $3.46 to $3.57 in the year ending October 2025, according to restaurant and café price data tracked by menu software company Toast.What's behind the biggest coffee price spike in decadesThe run-up in average retail coffee prices has been the steepest and most sustained since BLS began tracking those prices in 1980, the data shows.Weather issues came first. Drought and heavy rain disrupted harvests in Brazil and Vietnam in 2024, tightening supply well before tariffs took effect.Coffee futures prices then climbed from roughly $2 a pound in May 2024 to a peak of $4 by April 2025, one of the steepest increases the market has seen in decades, according to Intercontinental Exchange data. Because futures serve as the benchmark for what importers and roasters pay for beans, sharp increases often lead to higher costs, which may eventually show up in retail prices.Tariffs are another factor. In April, the U.S. imposed new tariffs on coffee imports — 10% on key coffee-growing Latin American countries and about 20% for Asian growers, with Brazil hit hardest at 50%. Since then, grocery-store coffee prices have risen about 21%, according to consumer price index data.In mid-November, the White House rolled back most of the new coffee tariffs, eliminating duties for nearly all producing countries except Brazil, which retained a 40% tariff. Last week, the administration removed the remaining 40% duty on Brazilian coffee as well, effectively ending tariffs on coffee imports from almost all major exporters.Because retail prices typically lag wholesale costs, it may take time before any easing shows up on store shelves. Still, removing tariffs should eventually help take some pressure off prices, according to the National Coffee Association, an industry trade group.\"Significant coffee price inflation has occurred during the time tariffs have been in place,\" a spokesperson for NCA tells CNBC Make It. \"Removing tariffs on the world's leading coffee producing countries is expected to significantly decrease costs.\"Black Friday sale: Want to up your AI skills and be more productive? Get 25% off our most popular course of the year, How to Use AI to Be More Successful at Work, with coupon code GETSMART.

    "body": "Being a great leader takes time and practice, and a growing share of workers are trying to get better at it.Search interest in the term \"leadership\" is at an all-time high, according to Google data, along with related terms like training, best practices, advice on how to lead a team and sources for professional development.The buzz likely stems from people wanting to lead during a time of rapid business changes due to remote and hybrid policies in offices, global politics, changing economic circumstances and the adoption of technology like AI, says Brian Glaser, Google's chief learning officer.Glaser has been a manager off and on for the last 20 years and leads the onboarding, training and leadership development for some 150,000 employees worldwide. As a leadership expert, Glaser tells CNBC Make It that people of all experience levels struggle with one main aspect of being a boss: delivering \"really effective feedback so that people are clear about where they stand.\"Instead, many managers shy away from critical or constructive feedback in the pursuit of being well liked.\"As a leader, being nice is great,\" Glaser says. That can lead you to be liked among your reports, but \"the name of the game is really to be respected.\"\"If you're not delivering the feedback, you may not get the kind of respect you need as a manager,\" he says. This can be tough for first-time managers or someone who's been promoted and is now overseeing the work of former peers.But teams can grow stagnant or repeat avoidable mistakes \"if you're only looking to tell people what's working and not necessarily delivering the hard stuff,\" Glaser says.Glaser's team is behind Google's latest People Management Essentials, a paid course available to the public that covers lessons from over a dozen Google bosses about what it takes to be an excellent leader.Some of the lessons about delivering solid feedback are inspired by sports psychology, Glaser says.\"We know the best athletes are the folks who receive constant feedback from their coaches about how they're performing, he says. Win or lose, \"every time they finish a game, they debrief, they talk about what worked and what didn't. We believe those same concepts can be applied to organizational life.\"Talking about areas for improvements helps ensure stronger performance outcomes in the future. Athletes including Super Bowl champ Tom Brady and Team USA Olympic gymnast Gabby Douglas have discussed that learning from mistakes and failures fueled their successes.In the workplace, meanwhile, telling a report that \"they need to improve can be challenging,\" Glaser says, \"but we know through good practice, managers can do this, and it really matters.\"Black Friday sale: Want to up your AI skills and be more productive? Get 25% off our most popular course of the year, How to Use AI to Be More Successful at Work, with coupon code GETSMART.

    "body": "With the rising cost of groceries, rent and other essentials, having money to set aside and save can feel impossible. However, saving doesn't always require more money — you might just need to reorganize what you already have, says Kashif Ahmed, a certified financial planner and lecturer at Suffolk University in Boston. Ahmed, who teaches a finance class to undergraduate students, says many of his students tell him they want to save more, but say they lack the funds to start. That tracks with national data: Nearly 75% of Gen Z adults reported having $1,000 or less saved, according to a Self Financial survey of over 2,000 adults in July. But often, \"the money is there, you just have to go look for it,\" Ahmed says. Here's where he recommends starting.How to reorganize your spendingAhmed's advice: Start by writing down every dollar you spend and sincerely looking at it.When looking through your list, ask yourself which expenses were absolutely necessary and which expenses were simply \"wants.\" For example, he says, do you really need two lattes a day or five different streaming services? Sometimes, it may be smart to bring in a third-party auditor — someone like a parent or friend who isn't emotionally invested in your purchases — who can identify places to cut spending and save instead. Even packing a meal instead of buying lunch once a week can be a great way to get started, Ahmed says. \"Financial security is absolutely possible,\" he says. \"It's all about discipline.\"It's OK to make fun purchasesSaving money doesn't necessarily mean you have to cut out all purchases that may bring joy or stick to a tight budget limited to essential items.Sometimes, a restrictive budget may even backfire on you, leading to periods of spending binges, Suze Orman, personal finance expert and host of the podcast \"Women & Money (and Everyone Smart Enough to Listen),\" told the Wall Street Journal in 2024.Instead, Orman said to try focusing on smaller, everyday decisions that can make you feel more in control of your spending. \"Just do one thing that might make you feel more secure,\" Orman said. \"Is that saving $10? Is that not going out to eat?\"Black Friday sale: Want to up your AI skills and be more productive? Get 25% off our most popular course of the year, How to Use AI to Be More Successful at Work, with coupon code GETSMART.

    "body": "Bestselling author and wellness leader Deepak Chopra is optimistic about the possibilities of artificial intelligence. \"The thing is, AI is here to stay,\" he says. Chopra believes that while the technology can be harmful, it can also be beneficial when used very specifically for self-discovery. Chopra recommends using AI chatbots to get to know yourself better, suggesting questions like, \"What is my purpose?\" and \"How can I cultivate self-compassion?\"Chopra recently launched an online wellness platform that offers meditations, community discussion boards and live sessions led by Chopra himself. And he's bullish enough on AI to have created his very own Deepak Chopra chatbot. Unlike large language models such as Anthropic's Claude and Google's Gemini, Chopra's bot is what's called a small language model. Instead of training the bot on all of human knowledge, it's trained on Chopra's work, specifically.\"I've written 95 plus books,\" he says. \"I've done innumerable conferences. I have thousands of videos on YouTube and LinkedIn and Facebook and Instagram and TikTok. So I fed all that into my AI.\" Chopra platform subscribers pay $10 monthly, which includes chatbot access. Non-subscribers can pay from 50 cents per 30-minute session to $6 a month to use the bot.The thing is, AI is here to stay.Deepak ChopraAuthor, wellness guruUsers can choose from a series of existing prompts on subjects including success, relationships, sex and spirituality, or they can simply put in their own question. Answers come back in text format and can also be played out loud in Chopra's voice. But Chopra says the bot does have its limits: \"We will not be doing suicide prevention,\" he says. \"That's for professionals.\" Chopra's chatbot will not offer psychotherapy either, he says.Instead, Chopra says you can give the bot prompts like \"I haven't slept in five days, can you give me a meditation?\" or \"I'm having difficulty in my relationship because we're not communicating.\" \"Then, we give you guidelines,\" he says. Ultimately, Chopra says he wants people to cultivate empathy, compassion, joy and peace of mind, and that he wants to be a resource for users around the clock. \"You have me as your companion in your pocket all the time,\" he says.He adds that he wouldn't mind continuing to be a presence in his family's life. \"My grandchildren's grandchildren will be able to have a conversation with me long after I'm gone,\" he says.Black Friday sale: Want to up your AI skills and be more productive? Get 25% off our most popular course of the year, How to Use AI to Be More Successful at Work, with coupon code GETSMART.

    "body": "The Jefferies Financial Group Inc. headquarters in New York, US, on Monday, Oct. 20, 2025. Michael Nagle | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesThe U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating Jefferies' relationship into bankrupt auto parts maker First Brands Group, The Financial Times reported Thursday. The newspaper, citing people with knowledge of the matter, said the regulator is looking into whether Jefferies gave investors enough information on its Point Bonita fund's exposure to the failed auto business. The inquiry into internal controls and potential conflicts within the bank is at an early stage, the report said. It's not clear whether it will result in any allegations of wrongdoing. Jefferies came under pressure last month after its exposure to First Brands — which collapsed under a series of complex debt agreements — raised fears of other bad loans on Wall Street.

    "body": "Boaz Weinstein is calling for the removal of the entire board of a tech-focused fund managed by Baillie Gifford, in a bid to reverse what the activist investor sees as \"unprecedented\" value destruction.In a letter to the Edinburgh Worldwide Investment Trust's board on Thursday, Weinstein — whose activist investment firm Saba Capital owns around 30% of shares in the trust — said the board has \"objectively and categorically failed\" to deliver the performance expected by shareholders.EWIT's portfolio comprises a global mix of smaller and emerging public and private companies focused on tech innovation and transformation, that target \"significant disruptive growth potential,\" according to the London-listed Baillie Gifford's website. Its holdings include Elon Musk's Space Exploration Technologies, or SpaceX, which makes up 8.4% of its portfolio.Weinstein said EWIT's net asset value is down 30.8% over the past five years, while its share price return has fallen 35%, having \"massively underperformed\" its self-selected benchmark, the FTSE All-Share Index, which is up 71.4% over the same period.That means the company's NAV return and share price performance ultimately lag the benchmark by more than 100% over the five-year period, Saba noted in the letter.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconEdinburgh Worldwide Investment Trust.\"The magnitude of this value destruction is unprecedented among peer U.K. equity investment trusts over this period,\" Weinstein wrote.Jonathan Simpson-Dent, chair of EWIT, expressed disappointment with Saba's open letter.He said EWIT's benchmark is the S&P Global Small Cap Index — not the FTSE All-Share Index cited in Weinstein's letter.\"It makes little sense to judge a global small-cap trust against a U.K. all-cap benchmark,\" Simpson-Dent said in a statement, adding that EWIT's NAV total return has been 17.5% to date, ahead of the S&P Global Small Cap Index's 4.8%. A Saba Capital spokesperson told CNBC: \"In its latest 2024 Annual Report, EWI compared company performance, specifically share price return, to the FTSE All-Share Index on page 79 citing it as 'a widely used measure of performance for UK listed companies'.\"The spokesperson said that EWI's share price return has underperformed the FTSE All-Share Index on a one-, three- and five-year period, and the S&P Global Small Cap Index on both a three- and five-year period, \"including by more than 60% over the five-year.\"'Constructive dialog'The trust's total assets stood at £847.15 million ($1.1 billion) as of Oct. 31. Weinstein is calling for a general meeting to appoint a new board composed solely of \"qualified, independent directors… committed to delivering long-term value for all shareholders.\"\"We remain profoundly frustrated by the board's prolonged inertia,\" the activist investor wrote in the letter on Thursday. \"We do not have faith in the current Board's ability to implement the necessary strategic changes.\"Simpson-Dent said EWIT's board will continue to seek \"constructive dialog\" with Weinstein toward an \"equitable and holistic\" solution, including return of capital. But he warned: \"While we are open to discuss Board composition with Saba, we would strongly reject any proposal to replace the entire Board and the ambiguity that would follow.\"He added: \"The company's actions over the last year have supported a tightly managed discount, currently 5.6%, significantly narrower than the Global Smaller Companies peer group weighted average discount of 10.9%.\"The move follows an earlier attempt by Saba last year to shake up the EWI trust's board, a bid which ultimately failed to win investor support.Weinstein — whose New York-based $6 billion hedge fund trades credit relative value opportunities — has built a number of positions across the U.K. investment trust space lately. Outlining two new bets at the annual Sohn London investment conference last week, he said there is \"a storm brewing\" in the U.K. investment trust sector where discounts have widened sharply.",

    "body": "Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-CA)Yuri Gripas | ReutersRep. Eric Swalwell, D-Calif., filed a 19-page lawsuit Tuesday in U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C., alleging Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Bill Pulte abused his authority to make \"fanciful\" mortgage fraud allegations against him and other critics of President Donald Trump.The lawsuit asks the court to declare Pulte's conduct unlawful, order him and the FHFA to withdraw a criminal mortgage fraud referral, and award damages for violations of federal privacy law.Swalwell — who announced Friday that he is running for governor of California — alleges in the complaint that Pulte improperly accessed and leaked his private mortgage records in retaliation for his political speech, violating both the Privacy Act of 1974 and the First Amendment.\"Director Pulte has combed through private records of political opponents to silence them,\" Swalwell posted in a statement on X.The suit alleges Pulte's referral of the matter to the Justice Department was \"patently false,\" noting that Swalwell had sworn in an affidavit that his Washington, D.C., home would be his wife's primary residence and that he remained a California resident.Swalwell's lawyers note in the filing that the disclosures landed just as Swalwell prepared to launch his gubernatorial bid. The leak of Pulte's referral letter to the media occurred \"with remarkable speed,\" the suit states, followed by conservative commentators posting details about his home where his wife and children live, activity Swalwell's suit says increased security risks for his family.The filing casts Pulte's actions as part of a broader effort by the Trump administration to use federal agencies and the courts against political opponents. Swalwell, a seven-term congressman and former House impeachment manager during Trump's second impeachment, has long been one of the most vocal critics of the president. \"Pulte's brazen practice of obtaining confidential mortgage records from Fannie Mae and/or Freddie Mac and then using them as a basis for referring individual homeowners to DOJ for prosecution is unprecedented and unlawful,\" the lawsuit argues. In recent months, Pulte has issued similar criminal referrals to Swalwell's to other Trump critics, among them New York Attorney General Letitia James, Sen. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., and Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook. James' indictment was dismissed by a federal judge Monday while Schiff faces an ongoing probe though has not been charged. Cook also has not been charged, though Trump cited the criminal referral as cause in his attempt to fire her from the board of governors for the Federal Reserve in August. The firing is currently on hold pending a Supreme Court review.Pulte defended his agency's criminal referral of Cook to CNBC in August, saying it wasn't politically motivated. \"We make referrals almost every day. Lisa Cook happened to be one of them,\" he said.In an interview with \"Squawk Box\" in September, Pulte refused to tell host Andrew Ross Sorkin where the tip came from.\"I'm not going to explain our sources and methods, where we get tips from, who are whistleblowers,\" Pulte said.Swalwell's lawsuit says no comparable FHFA criminal referrals have been made against Trump allies. There is evidence that top Trump officials like Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent made mortgage claims similar to ones Trump cited to try to fire Cook.Spokespeople for the FHFA and DOJ did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment.",

Anadolu | Anadolu | Getty ImagesSouth Korea became the latest country to impose sanctions on Prince Group, a multinational network accused of running large-scale fraud operations across Southeast Asia. Seoul's move follows similar actions by the U.S., UK, and Singapore.In a statement Thursday, South Korea's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that the measures mark the country's first independent sanctions regarding transnational crime and the \"largest single sanction measure in history,\" according to a Google translation.\"It shows the government's firm determination to actively respond to online organized crime in Southeast Asia that is causing serious damage at home and abroad,\" the statement added.

    "body": "A general view of the Baidu logo is seen at the Shanghai New Expo Center during the World Artificial Intelligence Conference 2025 in Shanghai, China, on July 28, 2025.Ying Tang | Nurphoto | Getty ImagesTech giant Baidu is emerging as one of China's key artificial intelligence chip players, positioning itself as a challenger to Huawei as both look to fill the void left by industry leader Nvidia being kept out of the country. Best-known as China's biggest search business, Baidu has in recent years refocused its business around driverless cars and AI, including a majority-owned subsidiary, Kunlunxin, which designs chips.Several analysts have upgraded their outlook on Baidu's stock over the past few weeks, citing the semiconductor business and forecasting the unit will gain more domestic orders.This month, Baidu laid out a five-year roadmap for its Kunlun AI chips, beginning with the M100 in 2026 and the M300 in 2027. The company already uses a mix of its self-developed chips in its data centers to run its ERNIE AI models, as well as Nvidia products. Baidu makes money by selling its chips to third parties building data centers as well as renting out computing capacity via its cloud. It has sought to position itself as a so-called \"full stack\" AI offering with infrastructure made up of chips, servers and data centers, as well as AI models and applications.And the chip business appears to be gaining traction. Earlier this year, Kunlunxin won orders from suppliers to China Mobile, one of the country's biggest mobile carriers.\"Kunlunxin has emerged as a leading domestic AI chip developer, focusing on high- performance AI chips for large language model (LLM) training and inference, cloud  computing, and telecom and enterprise workloads,\" analysts at Deutsche Bank said in a note this month.While Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) are widely regarded as the most advanced chips for training and running AI, the company has been blocked by the U.S. government from selling its top-end product to China. Beijing has also reportedly been persuading local tech companies not to buy the H20, a less powerful Nvidia chip designed for the Chinese market and greenlit for export.With Huawei — the leading player through its massive clusters of chips — out of the picture, analysts are suggesting Baidu will fill the void and its chip business is set for explosive growth.\"We believe domestic demand for AI compute in China remains intense, and hyperscalers are increasingly sourcing from local solution providers,\" JPMorgan said in a note on Sunday. \"We view Kunlun AI chip as one of the best positioned.\"The investment bank analysts forecast Baidu chips sales to increase six-fold to reach 8 billion Chinese yuan ($1.1 billion) in 2026.Analysts at Macquarie estimate that Baidu's Kunlun chip unit could be valued at about $28 billion. Baidu is not alone among China's tech giants when it comes to self-developed semiconductors. CNBC reported in August that Alibaba is also developing its next-generation AI chip. AI chip shortages hit ChinaBaidu's chip push comes as Chinese tech giants this month said they're seeing supply shortages.Eddie Wu, CEO of Alibab, said that \"the supply side is going to be a relatively large bottleneck\" over the next two-to-three years, referring to components and chips required to build data centers. Tencent said this month that its 2025 capital expenditure would be lower than initially anticipated. But Tencent President Martin Lau said this this was not because of a lack of demand, but more a shortage of available chips to spend the money on. \"It is not a reflection of our change in AI strategy ... It is indeed a change in terms of the AI chip availability,\" Lau said. watch nowPart of this shortage has been driven by global demand and resulting bottlenecks in the semiconductor supply chain. But China's effective block of Nvidia chips has also reduced the supply.Chinese tech firms have tried to mitigate the shortage by using stockpiled chips, as well as trying to make their AI models more efficient to do more with the semiconductors they have.Meanwhile, China has its own challenges with manufacturing because its biggest chipmaker SMIC, is unable to compete on the scale and technology with leaders like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. That makes it hard for the China to manufacture enough domestic chips to fill the shortfall. Like their U.S. counterparts, Chinese tech companies have continually reported strong demand for AI. \"We see that customer demand for AI is and remains very strong. In fact, we are not even able to keep pace with the growth in customer demand … in terms of the pace at which we can deploy new servers,\" Alibaba's Wu said this week. That gives Baidu an opportunity in China.\"Baidu's chip push is both a necessity and an opportunity. It's a necessity, because Chinese platforms can no longer assume a steady diet of US GPUs; opportunity, because there's now a semi‑captive, multi‑billion‑dollar domestic market for AI hardware that is compliant with both US export rules and Beijing's self‑reliance agenda,\" Nick Patience, practice lead for AI at The Futurum Group, told CNBC.\"If Baidu can ship competitive Kunlun generations on time, it doesn't just solve its own supply problem — it becomes a strategic supplier to the rest of China's AI industry.\"",

    "body": "This photograph shows a general view of Nexperia headquarters in Nijmegen on November 6, 2025.John Thys | Afp | Getty Images Dutch chipmaker Nexperia has publicly called on its China unit to help restore supply chain operations, warning in an open letter that customers across industries are reporting \"imminent production outages.\"Nexperia's Dutch unit said Thursday that its open letter followed \"repeated attempts to establish direct communication through conventional channels\" but did not have \"any meaningful response.\"The letter marks the latest twist in a long-running saga that has threatened global automotive supply chains and stoked a bitter battle between Amsterdam and Beijing over technology transfer. \"We welcomed the Chinese authorities' commitment to facilitate the resumption of exports from Nexperia's Chinese facility and that of our subcontractors, enabling the continued flow of our products to global markets,\" Nexperia's Dutch unit said in the letter.\"Nevertheless, customers across industries are still reporting imminent production stoppages. This situation cannot persist,\" they added. The group called on the leadership of Nexperia's entities in China to take steps to restore the  established supply flows without delay.In a statement, Wingtech Technology, Nexperia's Chinese parent company, said on Friday that the Dutch unit's open letter contained \"a large number of misleading and untrue allegations.\"It said the \"unlawful deprivation of Wingtech's control and shareholder rights over Nexperia\" was the root cause of the ongoing supply chain chaos.\"Combined with the recent series of actions by the Dutch government and Nexperia B.V., we believe their true intention is to buy time for Nexperia B.V. to construct a 'de-China-ized' supply chain and permanently strip Wingtech of its shareholder rights,\" Wingtech said.In this photo illustration, the logo of semiconductor manufacturer Nexperia is displayed on a screen.Vcg | Visual China Group | Getty ImagesNexperia manufactures billions of so-called foundation chips — transistors, diodes and power management components — that are produced in Europe, assembled and tested in China, and then re-exported to customers in Europe and elsewhere. The chips are relatively low-tech and inexpensive but are needed in almost every device that uses electricity. In cars, those chips are used to connect the battery to motors, for lights and sensors, for braking systems, airbag controllers, entertainment systems and electric windows. How did we get here? The situation began in September, when the Dutch government invoked a Cold War-era law to effectively take control of Nexperia. The highly unusual move was reportedly made after the U.S. raised security concerns. Beijing responded by moving to block its products from leaving China, which, in turn, raised the alarm among global automakers as they faced shortages of the chipmaker's components. In an apparent reprieve last week, however, the Dutch government said it had suspended its state intervention at Nexperia following talks with Chinese authorities. It was thought at the time that this could bring an end to the dispute and pave the way for a restoration of normal supply chains.  Rico Luman, senior sector economist for transport and logistics at Dutch bank ING, said it remains unclear how long the situation will last.\"The imposed measures to seize the Dutch Nexperia subsidiary have been lifted, but there are still talks ongoing about restoring the corporate structure and relation with parent company Wingtech,\" Luman told CNBC by email.\"It's not only about supplies of finished chips, it's also about wafer supplies from Europe to the Chinese entity,\" Luman said, adding that companies including Japan's Nissan and German auto supplier Bosch are among the firms to have warned about looming shortages.Nissan signage at a dealership in Richmond, California, US, on Friday, June 21, 2024.Bloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesA spokesperson for the German Association of the Automotive Industry (VDA), which represents Volkswagen, Mercedes-Benz Group and BMW among hundreds of others, warned of elevated risks to supply, \"particularly for the first quarter\" of 2026.\"In recent weeks, the German automotive industry has largely been able to keep production stable through intensive efforts,\" a VDA spokesperson told CNBC by email. \"However, the disruptions in the supply chain for Nexperia parts caused by political intervention have not been fundamentally resolved. Component availability remains uncertain,\" they added. ING's Luman said the Nexperia situation is somewhat comparable to China's rare earth export controls.\"The Chinese position appears strong again as European manufacturers are dependent on the supplies. And comparable to the rare earths, it's not fully transparent which buyer is able to qualify for which chip supplies,\" Luman said. — CNBC's Annika Kim Constantino contributed to this report.",

Apple denied the charges.The CCI's final verdict is still pending, but it said its \"prima facie view [is] that mandatory use of Apple's IAP for paid apps and in-app purchases restricts the choice available to the app developers to select a payment processing system of their choice,\" in an order in December 2021.Apple recorded its highest-ever quarterly shipments in India of 5 million units in the third quarter of 2025, according to data from IDC. watch nowThe company is expected to sell about 15 million iPhones in India this year and could rank among the top five smartphone companies there, Navkendar Singh, associate vice president with IDC India,  on Nov. 18.Apple is among the global companies diversifying their manufacturing supply chains away from China to India. In 2024, Apple's exports from India hit a record of $12.8 billion, up more than 42% from a year earlier.",

Its 300 wealthiest residents are worth a combined 850 billion Swiss Francs, or just over $1 trillion, according to business magazine Bilanz. But on Sunday, voters will go to the polls to vote on an inheritance tax that has riled them up. The proposal to tax every inheritance and gift of more than 50 million Swiss Francs at 50% is likely to be defeated. A recent poll put support at just 30%.watch nowBut close followers of the debate told CNBC the initiative has shaken wealthy individuals and family-owned companies since it was proposed in 2024. Swiss billionaire Peter Spuhler, founder and owner of Stadler Rail, has threatened to leave the country if the tax becomes law. He told told Swiss daily Tagesanzeiger that his family would struggle to pay such a tax as their wealth is tied up in companies.\"A lot of people who would be affected talked to their consultants and their tax lawyers, and they did the paperwork to be sure that this time of the year, a week before the final vote, they are ready to move out if necessary,\" Stefan Legge from the University of St. Gallen in Switzerland told CNBC on Friday.'The ultra wealthy are like queens on a chessboard'Legge, who conducted research into the potential impact of the tax, said: \"If you target the super wealthy, they are like queens on a chessboard.\" \"They are very mobile.

    "body": "Alibaba announced plans to release a pair of smart glasses powered by its AI models. The Quark AI Glasses are Alibaba's first foray into the smart glasses product category.AlibabaAlibaba's artificial intelligence-powered smart glasses went on sale on Thursday as the Chinese tech giant looks to ramp up its focus on consumer AI in an increasingly competitive market. The Quark AI Glasses, first announced in July, come in two variants — the S1, which starts at  3,799 Chinese yuan ($536) and G1 at 1,899 yuan.The tech giant has integrated its Qwen AI models — Alibaba's version of ChatGPT — with the device which also links to its newly-launched Qwen app. This means users can use voice control to get the glasses to carry out tasks.The lenses of the glasses are effectively screens and the device has a camera built into the frame. The main difference between the S1 and G1 is the display, Alibaba said.watch nowThe company said that some of the features include on-the-go translation, AI-generated meeting notes and the ability to ask the virtual assistants questions. Users take pictures of a product using the camera in the lens and then the device will show the price of that product on Taobao, Alibaba's main shopping app in China. Alibaba, like other technology companies such as U.S. giant Meta, are betting that smart glasses could be the next big consumer device after the smartphone.In September, Meta unveiled the $799 Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses, the social media company's first consumer-ready smart glasses with a built-in display. Users can control the device via hand gestures with a special wristband. Alibaba's glasses will initially go on sale in China and compete with domestic rivals, including consumer electronics maker Xiaomi and startup Xreal. The smart glasses market is still small but growing rapidly. By 2026, shipments of AI glasses are expected to exceed more than 10 million units, doubling from 2025, according to a forecast from Omdia. For Alibaba, the glasses are its latest play in the consumer AI market as it looks to build on its recent successes. The company's ChatGPT-style Qwen app got 10 million downloads in the first week of the public beta launch. Meanwhile, Alibaba's cloud computing business, where it books much of its AI-relate revenue, saw an acceleration of growth in the last quarter.The Hangzhou, headquartered company is one of the leaders in China's AI space, and has been investing aggressively in AI alongside rival giants like Baidu and Tencent, and aggressively launching new models.",

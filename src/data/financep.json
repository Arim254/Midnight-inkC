    "body": "A sign at a NYS Department Of Labor job fair at the Downtown Central Library in Buffalo, New York, US, on Wednesday, Aug. 27, 2025.Lauren Petracca | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesAnnounced job cuts from U.S. employers moved further ahead of 1 million for the year in November as corporate restructuring, artificial intelligence and tariffs have helped pare job rolls, consulting firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas reported Thursday.The firm said layoff plans totaled 71,321 in November, a step down from the massive cuts announced in October but still enough to bring the 2025 total up to 1.17 million. That total is 54% higher than the same 11-month period a year ago and the highest level since 2020, when the Covid pandemic rocked the global economy.In November, Verizon's announcement that it would slash more than 13,000 jobs helped drive the total. Tech companies, driven by innovations in artificial intelligence, listed 12,377 reductions, pushing the sector's 2025 total up 17% from a year ago. AI itself has been cited for 54,694 layoffs this year.Tariffs were cited as the driver of more than 2,000 cuts in November and nearly 8,000 year to date. The most-cited reason for the month was restructuring, followed by closings and market or economic conditions.\"Layoff plans fell last month, certainly a positive sign. That said, job cuts in November have risen above 70,000 only twice since 2008: in 2022 and in 2008,\" said Andy Challenger, workplace expert and chief revenue officer at Challenger, Gray & Christmas.Challenger also pointed out that since the financial crisis in 2008, companies have shifted away from end-year layoff announcements.\"It was the trend to announce layoff plans toward the end of the year, to align with most companies' fiscal year-ends. It became unpopular after the Great Recession especially, and best practice dictated layoff plans would occur at times other than the holidays,\" said Challenger.November offered some relief from the more than 153,000 cuts announced in October, which was the highest total for the month in 22 years.The numbers come with concerns rising over the state of the U.S. labor market.ADP reported Wednesday that private employers cut 32,000 jobs in November, the biggest decline in more than 2½ years.Hiring prospects have been dim this year as well, according to the Challenger report. Employers have announced 497,151 planned hires, off 35% from the same point in 2024.Despite signs of weakness elsewhere, Labor Department data has yet to reflect a surge in layoffs. The department on Thursday reported that weekly jobless claims unexpectedly tumbled to 191,000, the lowest in more than three years. Official data showed the decline of some 27,000 from the prior week was driven by unusually large drops in California and Texas and likely was influenced by the Thanksgiving holiday.",

Grogan | CNBCSoFi shares fell almost 6% in extended trading Thursday after the fintech company announced a $1.5 billion stock offering. The company, which provides online loans and other banking services, said in a press release that it will use the proceeds for \"general corporate purposes, including but not limited to enhancing capital position, increasing optionality and enabling further efficiency of capital management, and funding incremental growth and business opportunities.\"The announced offering comes after SoFi's market cap almost doubled so far in 2025. The stock price is up more than sixfold since the end of 2022. A company's share price often drops on a planned share sale as the offering dilutes the value of existing holders' stakes. In its third-quarter earnings release in late October, SoFi reported revenue growth of 38% from a year earlier to $961.6 million, while net income more than doubled to $139.4 million.

    "body": "The New York Times building is seen on September 16, 2025 in New York City. Michael M. Santiago | Getty ImagesThe New York Times on Thursday filed a lawsuit challenging new restrictions on reporters who cover the Pentagon, which the newspaper says violate the U.S Constitution's free press protections.The suit against the Defense Department and Secretary Pete Hegseth comes nearly two months after reporters from The Times and other mainstream news outlets, including CBS, CNN, Fox News, and NBC staged a dramatic walkout of the Pentagon and surrendered their credentials after refusing to comply with the rules. Those outlets have been replaced by reporters who are broadly sympathetic to the Trump administration.The Pentagon in October presented reporters who had desks there a 21-page rulebook that bars journalists from seeking or publishing information that has not been explicitly authorized by the Defense Department, even if the material is unclassified or obtained off Pentagon grounds.Outlets that refused to abide by the rules lost their Pentagon credentials.The Times' lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C., asks a judge to block the Pentagon from enforcing the policy, and to declare it unconstitutional. \"The policy, in violation of the First Amendment, seeks to restrict journalists' ability to do what journalists have always done — ask questions of government employees and gather information to report stories that take the public beyond official pronouncements,\" the suit says.The rules \"deprive the public of vital information about the United States military and its leadership,\" the suit says.The complaint also says that the Defense Department gave itself \"unbridled discretion\" to enforce the rules as it sees fit.Chief Pentagon Spokesman Sean Parnell, who is named as a defendant in the suit, told CNBC that the Defense Department \"is aware of the New York Times lawsuit and [looks] forward to addressing these arguments in court.\" The Times did immediately return a request for comment.The Pentagon's media rules were the latest step in Hegseth's broader push to reshape the press corps. Since arriving at the department in January after a contentious confirmation fight, Hegseth has stripped several national outlets of in-house workspaces, tightened rules on where reporters can move inside the building, and reassigned offices to conservative outlets and pro-Trump media figures willing to sign the agreement.Press-freedom advocates, including the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, say the Pentagon policy goes beyond past fights over individual White House press badges. Rather than targeting one reporter at a time, they argue, the rules bind the entire press corps — giving the Pentagon broad authority to revoke access based on the stories they pursue.\"The Pentagon's press access policy is unlawful because it gives government officials unchecked power over who gets a credential and who doesn't, something the First Amendment prohibits,\" Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press Vice President of Policy Gabe Rottman said in a statement Thursday, after the Times filed its suit.",

    "body": "Starbucks Workers United demonstrates outside of the Empire State Building as the union's strike enters its third week.CNBC | Amelia LucasNEW YORK — Starbucks Workers United held a rally outside the Empire State Building on Thursday as its open-ended strike entered its third week and no signs of an impending resolution.Adding to the crunch of holiday shoppers and tourists, several hundred picketers gathered outside of the famous landmark, which is also the site of a swanky three-floor Starbucks Reserve location and the company's regional headquarters. Members of other unions, like the AFL-CIO and Service Employees International Union, which is affiliated with Workers United, protested alongside baristas, chanting \"No coffee, no contract\" and \"What's disgusting? Union busting\" between speakers.\"Their fight is a fight really for all of us, to workers across the country, to corporations like Starbucks, across the country that workers are fed up with the status quo, and they're not going to take it anymore,\" SEIU President April Verrett told CNBC.Twelve demonstrators were arrested for blocking the building's entrance.Baristas launched the strike on Starbucks Red Cup Day last month, seeking new proposals from the company that address its top issues to finalize a contract. Those include improved hours, higher wages and the resolution of hundreds of unfair labor practice charges levied against Starbucks. Out of the 145 locations involved in the strike, 55 remain closed, according to a company spokesperson. The two parties have not been in active negotiations to reach a contract after talks between them fell apart late last year. The strikes have not changed that fact so far.While the strike has injected uncertainty into Starbucks' busy holiday season, the company has said its sales haven't been affected. CEO Brian Niccol told employees that Red Cup Day was its strongest in history. A successful holiday season will be key to the chain's turnaround under Niccol. Starbucks broke a nearly two-year streak of same-store sales declines in its most recently reported quarter. Past strikes have impacted less than 1% of its stores, the company said.The New York City rally comes after the company paid $38.9 million to settle violations of the city's Fair Workweek Law. Other large restaurant employers, like Chipotle, have previously run afoul of the law, which Starbucks said is \"notoriously challenging\" to navigate.The city's Department of Consumer and Worker Protection found Starbucks committed half a million violations of the law since 2021. The Fair Workweek law requires regular scheduling week to week, mandates schedules be provided 14 days in advance and says hours cannot be reduced by more than 15% without legitimate business reasons. DCWP Commissioner Vilda Vera Mayuga, who spoke at Thursday's rally, said the timing of the record-breaking settlement with the ongoing strike was coincidental.\"While the NYC laws remain unchanged and complex, our focus hasn't shifted – we're committed to creating the best job in retail and to ensuring our practices follow all laws,\" Starbucks said in a statement.The city's current Mayor Eric Adams and Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani have rallied behind striking workers. Mamdani joined Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., alongside baristas in Brooklyn earlier this week.Both Starbucks and the union have pointed blame at the other for failing to reach a bargaining agreement and maintain they are ready to speak when the other is. The two parties entered into mediation in February, and hundreds of barista delegates voted down the economic package Starbucks proposed in April. The company has said it is investing $500 million to improve the employee experience as part of its \"Back to Starbucks\" strategy. That investment includes upgrading its scheduling technology and adding more baristas to rosters. \"As we've said, 99% of our 17,000 U.S. locations remain open and welcoming customers —including many the union publicly stated would strike but never closed or have since reopened. Regardless of the union's plans, we do not anticipate any meaningful disruption. When the union is ready to return to the bargaining table, we're ready to talk,\" spokesperson Jaci Anderson said in a statement.",

Mustafa Yalcin | Anadolu | Getty ImagesBeta Technologies posted its first quarterly results on Thursday since the stock debuted on the New York Stock Exchange.The electric aircraft maker, which went public last month, reported revenue of $8.9 million, more than double the $3.1 million from a year ago.\"As a newly public company, we remain firmly grounded in what makes BETA unique—our simple, stepwise approach, our vertical integration and our focus on designing and manufacturing the complete electric aviation ecosystem to meet the needs of customers around the world,\" CEO Kyle Clark said in a statement.Net loss widened to $452 million, a loss of $9.83 per share, from a loss of $82.1 million, a loss of $1.81 per share, in the year-ago period.The company said the net loss took a hit from the issuance of convertible preferred stock.Beta forecasted full-year revenue to reach between $29 million and $33 million and adjusted EBITDA to range between a loss of $295 million and a loss of $325 million.The Amazon-backed company is establishing itself as another player alongside rivals Joby Aviation and Archer Aviation in the small but competitive electric vertical take-off and landing, or eVTOL, space.Air taxi manufacturers are vying to gain approval from the Federal Aviation Administration, which launched the eVTOL Integration Pilot Program, or eIPP, in September.Read more CNBC tech newsNvidia has a cash problem -- too much of itMeta faces Europe antitrust investigation over WhatsApp AI policyNvidia CEO Jensen Huang talks chip restrictions with Trump, blasts state-by-state AI regulationsDesign executive behind 'Liquid Glass' is leaving AppleClark told CNBC that the program is a \"massive testament\" to the Trump administration's efforts in accelerating the nascent industry. Beta is applying to the program with state partners, including North Carolina, Michigan and Ohio, to host its commercial aircraft operations as soon as next June.\"We have flown more than twice as many miles than anybody else in this industry,\" Clark said. \"That real-world flying gives us the ability to go into these eIPP opportunities with a mature type of certification product with a ton of reliability.\"The company is currently working on military and cargo operations before focusing on passenger applications. During the quarter, aircraft engine supplier GE Aerospace agreed to invest $300 million in Beta and co-develop a hybrid electric turbogenerator for both defense and civil use.\"The eIPP program is meant to augment America's drone dominance and that is a military interest as well as a civil interest,\" Clark said. \"Partnership with dual-use aircraft like ours, with the military and civil applications, is a big part of this.\"The company also worked with Hartzell Propeller to land certification during the quarter, becoming the first FAA-certified propeller specifically designed for advanced air mobility aircraft. The achievement marks another step closer to obtaining Type Certification, or approval of aircraft design, for Beta's H500A electric engine.\"To take something as big and new as a primary propulsion electric motor that other people are buying, that we're using in our own aircraft — we're flying all over the world in — and be in the final steps to Type Certification is a huge validation point,\" Clark said. Beta announced earlier this week an up to supply deal with air taxi company Eve Air Mobility.Eve agreed to purchase Beta's electric pusher motors, which could potentially equate to as much as $1 billion over 10 years. Clark said during an earnings call that the deal contributed to a component backlog of over $1 billion.",

    "body": "U.S. Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. looks on as he attends a press conference to discuss health insurance reform, at the Department of Health and Human Services in Washington, D.C., U.S., June 23, 2025.Kevin Mohatt | ReutersHealth and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s hand-picked vaccine committee on Thursday deferred crucial votes on hepatitis B vaccines for babies until Friday, saying it will give members more time to review proposed language on the measure. One panel member, Dr. Cody Meissner, a professor of pediatrics at the Dartmouth Geisel School of Medicine, brought a motion to defer the votes following confusion amongst the group about the language. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention currently recommends that every baby get vaccinated against hepatitis B within 24 hours of birth. It's unclear if the panel, called the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, or ACIP, could significantly delay or eliminate a so-called birth dose of the shot for babies whose mothers test negative for the virus. The group tabled a vote on the vaccine in September because some members called for a more robust discussion first.But any change could have wide-ranging consequences: Some public health experts say that having fewer newborns vaccinated against the virus could risk an increase in chronic infections among children. Hepatitis B, which can be passed from mother to baby during childbirth, can lead to liver disease and early death. There is no cure. \"We have a vaccine that is highly effective at preventing an incurable disease. We should take full advantage of that,\" Neil Maniar, a public health professor at Northeastern University, told CNBC. The birth dose recommendation was introduced in 1991 and is credited with driving down infections in kids by 99% since then. Maniar called that a \"remarkable success story that we run the risk of reversing\" if the committee changes the recommendation. Decisions by the panel are not legally binding, as it is up to states to mandate immunizations. But ACIP's recommendations have significant implications for whether private insurance plans and government assistance programs cover the vaccines at no cost for eligible children. The panel's upcoming two-day meeting in Atlanta comes after Kennedy earlier this year gutted the committee and appointed 12 new members, including some well-known vaccine critics. During the meeting in September, some advisors raised questions about whether the benefits of the shot outweigh potential safety risks. But the jab is \"an incredibly safe vaccine with minimal risks,\" Dr. Sean O'Leary, chair of the American Academy of Pediatrics' Committee on Infectious Diseases, said during a media briefing Tuesday. \"I never once saw a fever actually associated with hepatitis B vaccine,\" said O'Leary, who practiced for eight years as a general pediatrician and worked in a newborn nursery. The AAP, which publishes its own vaccine schedule, still recommends the universal birth dose of the hepatitis B vaccine because \"it saves lives,\" he added. A new review, published Tuesday, of more than 400 studies spanning four decades also found no evidence that delaying the universal hepatitis B vaccine birth dose improves safety or effectiveness. The review also found that the birth dose does not cause any short- or long-term serious adverse events or deaths.A 2024 CDC study showed that the current vaccination schedule has helped prevent more than 6 million hepatitis B infections and nearly 1 million hepatitis B-related hospitalizations.Merck and GSK manufacture the hepatitis B vaccines used starting at birth. Neither of the shots are significant revenue drivers for the companies. But John Grabenstein, a former Merck vaccine executive and military pharmacist, said a change to the recommendation could cause vaccine supply disruptions for the companies. \"They have build up their reserves, and they build up their thorough calculations so that they can meet the status quo,\" Grabenstein, who has no remaining financial ties to Merck, told CNBC. \"If you disrupt the status quo without warning, then there would be too much of some things and not enough of other things that could easily create spot shortages.\" Still, he said his first concern from a public health standpoint is that fewer children will get vaccinated on time, leaving them vulnerable to infection. Merck during the panel's September meeting also pushed back on changing the recommendation. \"The reconsideration of the newborn Hepatitis B vaccination on the established schedule poses a grave risk to the health of children and to the public, which could lead to a resurgence of preventable infectious diseases,\" Dr. Richard Haupt, Merck's head of global medical and scientific affairs for vaccines and infectious diseases, said at the time. ",

    "body": "General views of the Warner Bros water tower on the Warner Brothers studio lot on June 24, 2022 in Burbank, California.Aaronp/bauer-griffin | Gc Images | Getty ImagesWith more than a century of some of the most popular film and television content, it's no wonder why Paramount Skydance, Comcast and Netflix are bidding for Warner Bros. Discovery's assets.Paramount made an initial offer in September to acquire Warner Bros. Discovery, leading WBD, which months earlier had announced plans to split itself into two companies, to officially explore a sale process.WBD's plans mirrored those of Comcast — separating out its cable networks from its movie properties and streaming service, HBO Max. Its coveted library of content includes franchises like DC's superheroes, Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings, Game of Thrones, Looney Tunes and Scooby-Doo. It is also the distributor of Legendary's Dune franchise and Godzilla and King Kong films. The cable networks include CNN, TNT, TBS and TruTV, among others.Earlier this week the company received second-round bids from potential buyers, according to people familiar with the matter who declined to be named speaking about internal processes. As of Thursday morning, Netflix was the leading bidder based on how WBD is valuing the offers, CNBC reported Thursday. WBD expects to announce a winner as early as next week, sources told CNBC. \"All three candidates could potentially be beneficial, which is why Warner Bros. would be such an attractive acquisition,\" said Shawn Robbins, director of analytics at Fandango and founder of Box Office Theory. \"Potential isn't enough, though. Resources, experience, and the proven ability to execute must be weighed.\"Here's what each suitor could do with WBD assets. Preening PeacockComcast is in the process of spinning out its portfolio of cable networks, which includes CNBC, but will retain broadcast network NBC, streaming service Peacock, the Universal film studio and theme parks. Given its exit from the cable TV business, Comcast isn't interested in Warner Bros. Discovery's massive portfolio of networks. Therefore, Comcast's offer includes a clause that would allow WBD to spin out its cable networks at any point before the proposed acquisition closes, CNBC previously reported. Warner Bros. Discovery intellectual property would serve the most immediate boost to NBCUniversal's Peacock. The streaming service is far behind its peers in terms of subscriber numbers, with just 41 million customers as of Sept. 30. The platform has bulked up heavily on sports programming but has been lacking on original content.Outside of the superhero fare, WBD's television content could strengthen NBCUniversal's streaming service Peacock with programming like \"IT: Welcome to Derry,\" \"The Pitt,\" \"The Last of Us\" and a pair of shows from the Game of Thrones universe. Adding Warner Bros. Discovery's IP into the fold would allow Universal to bolster its number of popular franchises, pad its streaming service with television content and expand its theme park business.\"For Comcast, it would simply add to the depth of Universal's current roster which already mixes a healthy balance of IP and more daring, often original, content,\" Robbins said. \"They check a lot of necessary boxes, without question.\"Universal already has a vast collection of franchise IP including Jurassic Park, Fast & Furious and Despicable Me as well as a suite of popular horror films.\"Comcast — they've got a pretty good film slate,\" said Doug Creutz, senior media and entertainment analyst at TD Cowen. \"They're trying to sort of create Disney Prime piece by piece, and I guess having a superhero brand would be another step in that direction. I don't know that it's something that they particularly view as a strategic imperative. I think having more IP generally is something that, of course, you always would like.\"Warner Bros. Discovery's DC Studios, now under the stewardship of James Gunn and Peter Safran, are set for a slew of theatrical releases as well as upcoming TV series. The pair's first film, \"Superman,\" which released in July, tallied more than $600 million at the global box office and received positive reviews from critics. On the slate is a Supergirl film, a Superman sequel, a second Batman film from Matt Reeves and a Clayface feature. On the television front, DC has plans for shows centered on the Green Lantern Corps; the origins of Wonder Woman's island of Amazons; and some lesser known, but fan favorite comic book characters like Booster Gold.Comcast and Warner Bros. Discovery already have some IP in common. The NBCUniversal parent licenses the rights to the Wizarding World for its theme parks. Having the film and television rights to Harry Potter would allow the company more control over production and how that translates into rides, experiences and merchandise.\"There are synergistic opportunities that you could turn over if you had authority over film and TV production, along with having the theme parks,\" Creutz said.Disney is the blueprint for this strategy. The company's portfolio of intellectual property has been the bedrock of its theme parks since the first location opened its doors in 1955. Disney controls not only the production of content, but also how it's curated in its themed experiences.Nimble NetflixThe most surprising bidder of the bunch, Netflix, has similarly been looking only at WBD's streaming and studio assets.After all, Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos reiterated during the company's third-quarter earnings in October that the company has \"no interest in owning legacy media networks.\"Initially, analysts and industry insiders speculated that Netflix's interest in Warner Bros. Discovery was simply an effort to hike the price for its competitors who were eager to acquire WBD assets. But the streaming giant has made a bid of mostly cash, sources told CNBC, and remains a competitive bidder. And the streaming giant could earnestly benefit from WBD's content library.As a relatively new player in the space — Netflix didn't release original content until 2012 — it took the company time to build out its franchises. Because of that, Netflix didn't even launch a merchandising division until 2019 and didn't have an official online store until 2021.Now, it has a handful of strong intellectual properties like \"Stranger Things,\" \"KPop Demon Hunters,\" \"Bridgerton,\" \"Wednesday\" and \"Squid Games.\" Like Comcast, having access to beloved franchises that have built-in audiences would be a big boon for Netflix.Yet, industry experts are more interested in how the company would handle WBD assets that have traditionally been released in theaters.\"With Netflix, it's less a question of how it could benefit them and more a deep concern of how they would handle the Warner Bros. legacy, particularly from a theatrical perspective,\" said Robbins. \"The money would certainly be there, yes, as would the initial exposure. But would their willingness be to behave more like a traditional movie studio than they have shown so far?\"Netflix has long opposed releasing films in theaters and only does so to stay in awards contention, to appease high-profile directors or to capitalize on buzzy titles. The streamer has always argued that its content is meant to be delivered to its subscribers through the Netflix platform and has limited how long its theatrical releases run in cinemas.This strategy has allowed Netflix to avoid costly marketing campaigns, which are typically estimated to be about half of whatever is spent on the production budget. However, it also often puts the company at odds with theatrical partners. The company also does not share box-office data, something traditional movie studios provide.\"Many in the industry feel a Netflix purchase of Warner would be a death knell for some of the movie business's most important aspects, properties, and long-held traditions,\" Robbins said. \"Netflix would need a significant turnabout face to even begin easing that sentiment.\"Netflix has told Warner Bros. Discovery management that it would honor contractual agreements to release movies in theaters if it secures a deal to acquire its assets, people familiar with the matter told CNBC. Paramount PlusThings are moving fast over at Paramount.The company was recently merged with Skydance, and, in short order, its new CEO and chairman, David Ellison, has signed creative and C-suite talent, greenlit new franchises and struck a $7.7 billion deal for live UFC rights.This strategy was laid out in an open letter from Ellison published in early August, in which he told investors that Paramount would invest in \"high-quality storytelling and cutting-edge technology\" to help \"define the next era of entertainment.\"Ellison is hoping that the next era will include the acquisition of Warner Bros. Discovery — in its entirety.\"Paramount has struggled in recent years to capture the same kind of consistent, top-tier franchise output as some of their rivals,\" Robbins said. \"There's a strong argument that absorbing Warner Bros.' library would move the needle in a more material way pound for pound.\"Paramount has a suite of franchises like Star Trek, Transformers, Sonic the Hedgehog, Paw Patrol and SpongeBob SquarePants, but much of its theatrical success has been tied to one actor, in particular.\"Paramount's by-far-most-important IP is a 63-year-old dude who does his own stunts,\" Creutz said. \"Maybe they are going to make an AI version of Tom Cruise and we'll keep getting Tom Cruise movies for the next 100 years. But, the next thing down the ladder for them — it's Star Trek.\" Before the Paramount-Skydance merger, the studio released around eight films annually, Ellison told investors in the company's third-quarter earnings report in November. The new goal is to release at least 15 films theatrically in 2026.So far, the slate for next year has about 10 titles, some produced solely by Paramount and some as part of the studio's distribution deals. Most studios update their calendar throughout the year, especially as new independent features come up for sale during film festivals. Acquiring Warner Bros. Discovery and its theatrical slate would easily get Paramount past its goal. However, Creutz noted that typically when studios merge, the number of films tends to decline in the years that follow. \"If Warner merges with any of these other companies, you are going to see some similar dynamic on the film side, you're going to see a similar dynamic on the TV production side, and you're probably going to see a similar dynamic in whatever they do with the streaming platform,\" he said. \"Presumably, in all three cases, there's a merger of streaming platforms and that's going to probably result in less content for consumers.\"Where Paramount diverges from the competing bids is that it wants all of WBD, including its cable networks. Of note, CNN would bolster Paramount's news coverage, which already includes CBS, and the addition of TNT, TBS and TruTV would represent a big addition to the company's sports coverage.Live sports rights are scarce and only become available when previous deals expire. Apple has already emerged as the future home of Formula 1, and Major League Baseball is waiting until its deals expire after the 2028 season to reorganize its media packages. That means that Paramount will have few other top-shelf sports assets to bid on and acquire in the medium term.Meanwhile, Warner Bros. Discovery has the rights to broadcast games from the National Hockey League, Major League Baseball and NCAA March Madness basketball along with the French Open and NASCAR.Disclosure: Comcast is the parent company of NBCUniversal, which owns CNBC. Versant would become the new parent company of CNBC upon Comcast's planned spinoff of Versant.— CNBC's Julia Boorstin, Lillian Rizzo and Alex Sherman contributed to this report. ",

    "body": "Jensen Huang, chief executive officer of Nvidia Corp., during the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC) sports day event in Hsinchu, Taiwan, on Saturday, Nov. 8, 2025.Lam Yik Fei | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesWhen Nvidia this week said it would take a $2 billion stake in chip design company Synopsys, it was just the latest in a string of massive investments announced by the chipmaker this year. Nvidia has also said it would take a $1 billion stake in Nokia, invest $5 billion in Intel and $10 billion in Anthropic — $18 billion in investment commitments from those four deals, not counting smaller venture capital investments.That doesn't even include the biggest commitment of all: $100 billion to buy OpenAI shares over a number of years, although there is still no definitive agreement, Nvidia finance chief Colette Kress said Tuesday at the UBS Global Technology and AI conference. It's a lot of money and a lot of deals, but Nvidia's got the cash to write big checks. At the end of October, Nvidia had $60.6 billion in cash and short-term investments. That's up from $13.3 billion in January 2023, just after OpenAI released ChatGPT. That launch three years ago was key to making Nvidia's chips the most valuable tech product.As Nvidia has transformed from a maker of gaming technology into the most valuable U.S. company, its balance sheet has become a fortress, and investors are increasingly wondering what the company will do with its cash. \"No company has grown at the scale that we're talking about,\" said CEO Jensen Huang, when asked what the chipmaker plans to do with all its cash, on Nvidia's earnings call last month.Analysts polled by FactSet expect the company to generate $96.85 billion in free cash flow this year alone and $576 billion in free cash flow over the next three years. Some analysts would like to see Nvidia spend more of its cash on share repurchases. \"Nvidia is set to generate over $600B in free cash flow over the next few years and it should have a lot left over for opportunistic buybacks,\" wrote Melius Research analyst Ben Reitzes in a note on Monday.The company's board increased its share repurchase authorization in August, adding $60 billion to its total. In the first three quarters of the year, it spent $37 billion on share repurchases and dividends.\"We're going to continue to do stock buybacks,\" Huang said. Nvidia is doing the buybacks, but it's not stopping there. Huang said that Nvidia's balance sheet strength gives its customers and suppliers confidence that orders in the future, which he called offtake, will be filled. \"Our reputation and our credibility is incredible,\" Huang said. \"It takes a really strong balance sheet to do that, to support the level of growth and the rate of growth and the magnitude associated with that.\"Kress, Nvidia's CFO, on Tuesday said the company's \"largest focus\" is making sure it has enough cash to deliver its next-generation products on time. Most of Nvidia's largest suppliers are equipment manufacturers like Foxconn and Dell, which can require that Nvidia provide working capital to manage inventory and build additional manufacturing capacity. Huang called his company's strategic investments \"really important work\" and said that if companies like OpenAI grow, it drives additional consumption of AI and Nvidia's chips. Nvidia has said that it does not require any of its investments to use its products, but they all do anyway. \"All of the investments that we've done so far — all of it, period — is associated with expanding the reach of Cuda, expanding the ecosystem,\" Huang said, referring to the company's artificial intelligence software.In an October filing, Nvidia said it had has already made $8.2 billion in investments in private companies. For Nvidia, those investments have replaced acquisitions. Nvidia's $7 billion acquisition of Mellanox in 2020 is the largest the company has ever made, and it laid the groundwork for its current AI products, which aren't single chips but entire server racks that sell for around an estimated $3 million.But the company faced regulatory issues when it tried to buy chip technology firm Arm for $40 billion in 2020. Nvidia called off the deal before it could be completed after regulators in the U.S. and U.K. raised concerns about its effects on competition in the chip industry. Nvidia has purchased some smaller companies in recent years, to bolster its engineering teams, but it hasn't completed a multibillion acquisition since the Arm deal failed.\"It's hard to think about very significant, large types of M&A,\" Kress this week said, speaking at an investor conference. \"I wish one would come available, but it's not going to be very easy to do so.\"WATCH: Nvidia CEO says he supports export controls ahead of Senate Banking Committee meetingwatch now",

David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesApple's general counsel, Kate Adams, and its vice president for environment, policy, and social initiatives, Lisa Jackson, are retiring from the company, the iPhone maker announced on Thursday. Jennifer Newstead, Meta's chief legal officer, will become Apple's new general counsel in March, and Jackson's government affairs staff will report to her starting late next year, Apple said. The two executives, who both reported to Apple CEO Tim Cook, are the latest members of senior leadership to exit the company. In recent weeks, Apple's head software designer said he was leaving to join Meta, while Apple said its AI chief was retiring, along with its chief operating officer.Adams joined Apple from Honeywell and became general counsel in 2017, and oversaw legal matters including litigation, global security, and the company's privacy initiatives. Under Adams, Apple grappled with rising antitrust scrutiny and regulation around the world, including major lawsuits in the U.S. over the iPhone App Store's restrictions and fees. Jackson joined Apple in 2013, and led the company's diversity programs as well as much of its policy work in Washington, D.C. Before that, she spent four years as administrator of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, a position she was appointed to by President Barack Obama. With her emphasis in areas like social justice and renewable energies, Jackson's job lost relevance during the second Trump administration, which has publicly denounced diversity, equity and inclusion programs and slammed efforts to combat climate change. Apple has faced increased tariffs from the Trump administration, and Cook has met with President Donald Trump several times to tout the company's American manufacturing plans as part of an effort to influence policy. Jackson was instrumental in Apple's launch of its Racial Equity and Justice Initiative following the 2020 murder of George Floyd. She then helped expand the company's equity and justice efforts to other countries, including the U.K., Mexico and New Zealand, according to a report published in 2023.\"At Apple, we pledge that our resolve will not fade,\" Jackson wrote in a section of that report. \"We won't delay action. We will work, each and every day, on the urgent task of advancing equity.\"Jackson also worked on Apple's environmental image. Her job \"focused on reducing greenhouse gases, protecting air and water quality, preventing exposure to toxic contamination, and expanding outreach to communities on environmental issues,\" according to her bio on the company's website. She discussed Apple's plans to become carbon neutral at iPhone launch events.Jackson also accompanied Cook to several official functions in Washington, including state dinners. Apple CEO Tim Cook and Apple Vice President Lisa Jackson arrive at the White House for a state dinner on April 10, 2024 in Washington, DC. Tasos Katopodis | Getty ImagesNewstead, who will become Apple's top lawyer, has overseen Meta's legal and regulatory matters pertaining to its family of apps like Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp since 2019. A Meta spokesperson said Newstead will be staying through the end of the year and that the company is actively searching for her replacement.Prior to Meta, Newstead served as a Trump-appointed legal advisor at the State Department during the president's first administration in 2019.  Before that, she was a partner at Davis Polk & Wardwell and a general counsel of the White House Office of Management and Budget, among other roles in the U.S. government.CNBC's Jonathan Vanian contributed to this story.WATCH: Apple AI chief steps downwatch now",

    "body": "A general view of the Microsoft office building is seen in Cologne, Germany, on November 18, 2025.Nurphoto | Nurphoto | Getty ImagesMicrosoft said Thursday that it will increase the prices of Office productivity software subscriptions for commercial and government clients on July 1.The company's Office applications, which include Word, Excel, PowerPoint and Outlook, have been facing increased competition in recent years from Google. \"We are continuously investing and innovating our platform for the future,\" Nicole Herskowitz, corporate vice president for Microsoft 365 and Copilot, wrote in a blog post. \"In the last year, we released more than 1,100 features across Microsoft 365, Security, Copilot, and SharePoint.\" The new features have added value to the suites, she wrote.Price hikes for commercial Office subscriptions have been infrequent. In 2022, Microsoft raised prices of its productivity bundles for the first time since launching the original Office 365 subscriptions in 2011. Microsoft changed the name of Office 365 to Microsoft 365 in 2020. In January, Microsoft announced a price hike for consumer Office bundles.Microsoft offers Office 365 subscriptions for commercial use that include access to its productivity applications, along with higher-priced Microsoft 365 subscriptions that also include Windows operating system updates.Here's a breakdown of the commercial price changes:For small and medium-sized businesses, Microsoft 365 Business Basic will cost $7 per person per month, up from $6.Microsoft 365 Business Standard will be available for $14, up from $12.50.Microsoft 365 Business Premium will continue to cost $22.The entry-level Office 365 E1 offering for enterprises will still be sold for $10.Office 365 E3 will jump 13% to $26 from $23.The Microsoft 365 E3 package including Windows for enterprises will rise 8% to $39 from $36.The full-featured Microsoft 365 E5 will increase to $60 from $57.For front-line workers such as cashiers, Microsoft 365 F1 subscriptions will cost $3, up from $2.25.Microsoft 365 F3 will be available for $10, up from $8.The U.S. Defense Department and other government clients will face similar percentage price increases.The various subscriptions all exclude access to the $30 Microsoft 365 Copilot add-on that draws on generative artificial intelligence models. Some companies have started widely rolling out Copilot, while others have held off on expanding their deployments, CNBC reported last week.In many cases, organizations receive discounts off of list prices, but Microsoft has cut back on direct volume deals for some types of customers.Almost 43% of Microsoft's $77.7 billion in fiscal first-quarter revenue came from its Productivity and Businesses Processes segment, which includes Office. In October, the company said revenue from Microsoft 365 commercial cloud services jumped 17%, while seats increased 6%, mainly from products targeting small and medium-sized businesses and front-line workers.WATCH: Microsoft sees 'huge' challenge and great opportunity as global economy enters a new phase, president sayswatch now",

    "body": "The FBI on Thursday morning arrested a suspect accused of planting pipe bombs outside the Republican and Democratic party headquarters in Washington, D.C., prior to the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riot, the Trump administration said.The suspect, Brian Cole Jr., a 30-year-old resident of Woodbridge, Virginia, is charged with \"use of an explosive device,\" U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi said at a press briefing Thursday afternoon.The investigation is ongoing and more charges could be filed, Bondi noted, adding that search warrants are currently being executed.A criminal complaint unsealed after the briefing shows Cole facing a charge of transporting an explosive device in interstate commerce with intent to kill, injure or intimidate or unlawfully destroy property. Cole is also charged with \"malicious destruction or attempted malicious destruction by means of fire and explosive materials.\"A surveillance photo released by the FBI shows a person in Washington, U.S., January 6, 2021. The FBI issued a notice, which features this surveillance photo, requesting information on person(s) responsible for pipe bombs left at the Republican National Committee (RNC) and Democratic National Committee (DNC) headquarters.FBI | ReutersThe arrest is a massive breakthrough in the nearly five-year federal investigation into who placed the bombs, which did not detonate. The devices were planted on the evening of Jan. 5 and discovered around 1 p.m. ET the next day.\"An individual who is now alleged to have placed multiple explosive devices to blow up multiple people and multiple officials [and] innocent civilians is now arrested,\" FBI Director Kash Patel said at the press briefing.MS NOW, which reported the arrest earlier Thursday morning, said police have not yet determined a motive, citing a law enforcement official.But two people briefed on the arrest told MS NOW that the suspect has been linked to statements that show support for an anarchist ideology.Bondi, asked about Cole's motivations at the briefing, would only say that the DOJ's probe is ongoing.Prince William County Police block the street near the house where the FBI made an arrest, in Woodbridge, Va., Thursday, Dec. 4, 2025.Steve Helber | APCole is described as a five-foot-six-inch-tall man who \"wears corrective eyeglasses,\" an unnamed FBI special agent wrote in an affidavit in support of the criminal complaint.He lives with his mother and other family members and \"works in the office of a bail bondsman in northern Virginia,\" the agent wrote.In 2019 and 2020, Cole allegedly bought items that matched the components used to manufacture the pipe bombs, the FBI discovered after obtaining records for his checking account and three of his six credit cards.The agent said those items included: one-inch-by-eight-inch galvanized pipes; black and galvanized \"end caps,\" which were used to seal the pipes; nine-volt battery connectors; white kitchen timers; and 14-gauge red and black electrical wire.The FBI also obtained phone records that showed Cole's cellphone in the area near the Democratic and Republican National Committee buildings on Jan. 5, 2021, according to the affidavit.The same evening, Cole's 2017 Nissan Sentra was observed driving past a license plate reader in D.C. less than half a mile from the spot where the suspect was first observed on foot, the special agent wrote.FBI Director Kash Patel speaks during a news conference on the January 6th pipe bomber at the Department of Justice on December 4, 2025 in Washington, DC.Andrew Harnik | Getty ImagesThe discoveries that led to the arrest did not come from new evidence, but rather from the same trove of material that had mostly been gathered in 2021 and 2022, two sources told MS NOW.That means the suspect could feasibly have been arrested years earlier — a fact that could cause embarrassment for the FBI, those sources said.Patel, at Thursday's presser, touted that the FBI under his leadership \"did not discover any new information.\"The agency instead \"reexamined every piece of evidence, sifted through all the data,\" Patel said, claiming that was \"something that the prior administration refused and failed to do.\"As recently as late October, the bureau was offering a $500,000 reward for information that would help authorities identify the Capitol Hill bombing suspect.A suspect in the planting of explosive devices near the Democratic and Republican committee headquarters in Washington is seen walking past the Capitol Hill Club, also known as the National Republican Club of Capitol Hill, in Washington in this still frame taken from video released on March 9, 2021. Handout | ReutersSurveillance video released by the FBI shows that around 7:54 p.m. ET on Jan. 5, 2021, a person wearing a face mask, black gloves and a gray hoodie placed a bomb outside the DNC building.About 22 minutes later, the same person appeared to place a second bomb by the RNC's offices, according to the footage.The devices were planted hours before a mob of President Donald Trump's supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol as lawmakers prepared to confirm former President Joe Biden's 2020 election win.Nearly 1,600 people were criminally charged in connection with that riot. Trump, in one of his first acts after retaking the White House in January, pardoned the vast majority of them.When NBC News asked the White House how the administration reconciles its efforts to arrest Cole with Trump's mass pardons for others who committed crimes — some violent in nature — on Jan. 6, a spokesperson called the comparison \"alarming and insulting.\"A poster is displayed during a press conference with Attorney General Pam Bondi and FBI Director Kash Patel about the January 6th pipe bomber at the Department of Justice on December 4, 2025 in Washington, DC. Andrew Harnik | Getty ImagesThe timing of the pipe-bomb placement, and the elusiveness of the perpetrator, have made the case a hotbed of conspiracy theories.Last month, a conservative news site named a former U.S. Capitol Police officer as a possible match for the pipe bomber, based largely on a \"gait analysis.\" The FBI poured cold water on the story, and the accused officer cleared her name by providing a video of her playing with her puppies at the time the bombs were placed, CBS News reported.The yearslong investigation was a priority for the FBI, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, the D.C. Metropolitan Police Department and the U.S. Capitol Police.Security fencing remains installed around the Democratic National Committee (DNC) headquarters on November 16, 2023 in Washington, DC.Kevin Dietsch | Getty ImagesBy January, the FBI said investigators and related partners had visited more than 1,200 residences and businesses, interviewed over 1,000 people, reviewed nearly 40,000 video files and assessed more than 600 tips.As part of their search for the bomber, the FBI subpoenaed credit card data from box-store retailers to identify people who bought the same type of battery components believed to be used in the devices, MS NOW reported.Read more CNBC politics coverageJudge dismisses James Comey and Letitia James cases over 'unlawful' prosecutor appointmentSen.

    "description": "GM Chief Product Officer Sterling Anderson during the automaker’s “GM Forward” event on Oct. 22, 2025 in New York City.GMDETROIT — General Motors' new",
    "body": "GM Chief Product Officer Sterling Anderson during the automaker’s “GM Forward” event on Oct. 22, 2025 in New York City.GMDETROIT — General Motors' newest product and technology executive has said he thinks of the Detroit automaker as a canvas. One that can be curated, retouched or even torn apart. After roughly six months as executive vice president and chief product officer, Sterling Anderson appears to be putting all three ideas to work as he oversees the company's vast product portfolio — from the vehicles themselves to the software powering them.Anderson, who left the self-driving car company Aurora Innovation that he co-founded to join GM in June, has quickly become the most influential product executive in more than 15 years, outside of GM President Mark Reuss.He has consolidated power to oversee \"the end-to-end product lifecycle\" of GM vehicles, including manufacturing engineering, battery, software and services product management, and engineering teams, according to GM. \"My priority is to accelerate the pace of innovation. One of the ways we do that is with this disaggregation of, or this abstraction of, software from hardware,\" he told CNBC during an Oct. 22 technology event in New York. \"That's the point of the role, I think, is it brings together all of these pieces into a unified approach to how we do product going forward.\"Since then, the company's acclaimed heads of software and artificial intelligence have unexpectedly exited the company after relatively short tenures. Their main responsibilities related to vehicles now fall under Anderson.GM attributed the abrupt departures of Dave Richardson, senior vice president of software and services engineering, and Barak Turovsky, head of AI, to restructuring efforts.Mary Barra, Chair and CEO of General Motors (right to left), Mark Reuss, President, Sterling Anderson, Chief Product Officer, and Dave Richardson, Senior Vice President Software and Services Engineering at \"GM Forward\" on Wednesday, October 22, 2025 in New York.GM\"We are strategically integrating AI capabilities directly into our business and product organizations, enabling faster innovation and more targeted solutions,\" a GM spokeswoman said about Turovsky's departure in an emailed statement last week.It's another indication of Anderson's strategy. He previously told CNBC that for GM to succeed, software and product must be thought of as one and the same rather than as separate units, like they have been in recent years. Anderson said he spent the first months of his GM tenure \"in a listen mode,\" immersing himself in the automaker's operations.\"What that five months of listening has allowed me to do is really fine tune and target how we're going, not just kind of what we're going to innovate on, but how we're going to do it,\" he said in the October interview.A third executive is also leaving soon, as Baris Cetinok, senior vice president of software and services product management, will depart the company effective Dec. 12, as first reported by CNBC.Unlike Richardson and Turovsky, the company did not attribute his departure to the restructuring. Three sources familiar with the situation who spoke anonymously because the discussion was private told CNBC that Cetinok left to pursue another opportunity.Cetinok, Richardson and Turovsky either declined to comment or did not respond to requests for comment about their departures. Cetinok and Richardson joined GM in 2023, while Turovsky was hired in March.'Silicon Valley cowboy'Anderson, a former McKinsey & Co. consultant turned Tesla executive, said before he joined GM, he had thought of the automaker more of a comedic caricature rather than a canvas that he would help turn into a modern masterpiece.Anderson said CEO Mary Barra and Reuss, whom he reports to, helped him break down that \"old-world automotive\" caricature and concerns about employees of the automaker not supporting his efforts.\"I was really worried about it, right? I'm the 'Silicon Valley cowboy' that's coming into Detroit and, you know, 'pew pewing' his way through an innovation story with a team that I was concerned wouldn't receive that well. I found it quite different from what I'd expected,\" Anderson said.His appointment is a refocus for the automaker on software-defined vehicles and autonomy. He said GM's goal is to build an autonomous vehicle, which comes a year after the company disbanded its majority-owned Cruise AV business following years of development and billions of dollars in capital. New York Times columnist Andrew Ross Sorkin and Chair and CEO of General Motors Mary Barra speak onstage during the 2025 New York Times Dealbook Summit at Jazz at Lincoln Center on December 03, 2025 in New York City. Michael M. Santiago | Getty Images News | Getty Images\"Just be clear, we're developing a self-driving product,\" he told CNBC. \"It's a self-driving product that can be safe without any handbacks to the human in safety critical situations.\"Barra on Wednesday cited Anderson and the automaker's past efforts in autonomous vehicles as reasons why GM is \"well positioned\" to achieve autonomous highway driving in its vehicles beginning in 2028.\"As we talk about artificial intelligence, autonomous driving is one of the ultimate applications that I still strongly believe in,\" Barra said at The New York Times DealBook Summit, reconfirming the automaker's \"personal autonomous vehicle\" plans rather than Cruise robotaxis. Anderson is considered a leading expert in vehicle autonomy. Before co-founding self-driving firm Aurora, he led Tesla's Model X program and the team that delivered its \"Autopilot\" advanced driver assistance system. He also developed the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's \"Intelligent Co-Pilot,\" a semi-autonomous vehicle safety system.Anderson, who holds a master's and Ph.D. in robotics from MIT, said it took several conversations for him to leave Aurora, which he thought he \"would die with.\"watch nowHe isn't alone in his change of heart; however not many have lasted long at the automaker. Several other current and former Silicon Valley executives have voiced similar optimism about GM as well as its longstanding CEO and president — both of whom have spent their entire careers at the automaker as \"GM lifers.\"Richardson previously hailed working for Barra, who he reported to before Anderson, as \"an opportunity of a lifetime.\" Cetinok previously described his position as \"a product person's dream\" in an interview with CNBC.Jens Peter \"JP\" Clausen, who led Tesla's manufacturing expansion and worked at Lego and Google, partly credited the \"opportunity to work for a leader like\" Barra as a reason to join GM as its head of manufacturing before an unexpected departure after only one year.The accolades have gone both ways. When Anderson's appointment with GM was announced in May, Barra and Reuss hailed Anderson as being equipped to \"evolve\" and \"reinvent\" the automaker's operations.In addition to Anderson's new product unit, Reuss continues to oversee the automaker's manufacturing, design, marketing and sales, among other operations.Tech execsThe global automotive industry has battled for years to better integrate technology into vehicles — from their production to consumer-facing software and remote, or \"over-the-air,\" updates like Tesla pioneered.GM has taken an aggressive approach to tech by hiring leaders from Tesla and companies such as Apple and Google. However, many times, those executives have had short tenures with the company, such as the three most recent departures.\"[Traditional U.S. automakers] have very much had a significant struggle with understanding software and electronics technology, and that has caused them to have a parade of experts quote 'coming in to help,'\" said Peter Abowd, an engineer turned automotive and technology consultant.watch nowAbowd, general manager of engineering excellence at consulting firm Envorso, attributed the executive turnover to \"a misapplication of skills and talent,\" as well as unrealistic expectations and overwhelming responsibilities in a company as large as GM and an industry as complex as the automotive world. \"It's just kind of setting the person up for a bit of failure,\" Abowd said. \"In a couple years, you can't culturally shift an organization ... so the best thing to do is to part ways.\"That kind of turnover has led automakers like GM to regularly pivot in different directions, including in-vehicle technologies, electric vehicle batteries and other areas not traditionally \"core\" to the automotive industry. Barra, who is GM's longest-serving CEO since the company's founder, has become known for hiring executives at opportunistic times based on the company's top priorities, which now appear to largely land under Anderson.GM \"is really good at a lot on things\" that aren't necessarily apparent to those outside the company, according to Anderson. He said he believes combining his experience with fast-moving companies such as Tesla and Aurora and GM's \"massive machine\" and resources will better position the automaker for the future.\"I view it as a canvas,\" Anderson said. \"This is an extraordinary opportunity for innovation, and I'd be remiss not to see what I can do for it.\" ",

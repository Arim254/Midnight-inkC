    "body": "CNBC correspondent Ernestine Siu attended an AI hackathon.Courtesy of Ernestine SiuI like to spend most of my weekends taking workout classes with friends, exploring new restaurants or vegging out on the couch with a movie on. The past weekend, however, was unique. Instead of the usual routine, I chose to immerse myself in a 24-hour 'vibe coding' hackathon.I attended one of Singapore's biggest in-person hackathons ever, which was sponsored and supported by AI heavyweights from around the world including OpenAI, Cursor, Anthropic, Google DeepMind and more.The event took place on a university campus from about 9 a.m. on Saturday to Sunday noon. Over 400 people participated, ranging from highly experienced engineers to first-timers. The goal was simple: build something from scratch with the help of artificial intelligence.\"Use your imagination... build something unhinged. Build something wacky,\" said Agrim Singh, one of the event's organizers and the co-founder of Niyam AI.Several teams really took that advice to heart.Some standout projects included F**Yu.AI, an AI-enabled productivity app that \"bullies you into greatness,\" by calling users on their cell phones to yell at them to complete tasks, and RizzedIn, a dating site that helps connect \"career-minded individuals.\"Some members of the winning teams with CNBC correspondent, Ernestine Siu (right).Courtesy of Nicholas ChengBy the end of the weekend, about 150 projects were submitted. The winner, Sritam Patnaik, built an AI-powered whiteboarding tool that allows users to draw using just their hand movements tracked through a webcam. He took home prizes worth over $50,000 Singapore dollars (about $39,000).The second and third place winners created a human-versus-AI speed game and a \"Netflix for corporate training\" tool that makes compliance training videos more engaging for employees.Inside a 24-hour hackathonAs someone without a technical background, I was nervous entering the event but excited to meet the hackathon community. I knew I had to optimize my chances of building something successfully by teaming up with people who were much more technical than me.Through Discord, I found my team for the hackathon: Gabrielle Ong who has a product development background, Aung Maung who has a deep tech background, Ninna Cao who has a product design background and Jay Chen who has a software engineering background. What did I offer? Ideas, my storytelling abilities and vibes.Participants filled a lecture hall at the Singapore University of Technology and Design campus during the hackathon.Courtesy of Nicholas ChengWe bonded over a shared desire to preserve the legacies of our grandparents. So, we built Heirloom — a digital time capsule which can be used to capture and store family stories and recipes, so that they can be passed down for generations to come.We spent all of Saturday working on transforming our idea into a product. Some of us stayed up the entire night working on the project — while others (me) unfortunately didn't have the stamina to do so.We were trying to do a bit of a count ... And we found people in like random lecture rooms. It was just the funniest [thing] ... It was like catching wild Pokemon.Sherry JiangCo-founder, PeekWhen I got back to the campus on Sunday morning, I saw people sleeping on benches, on the floor and just about everywhere, while others were still making last minute adjustments before submitting their projects for judging.An estimated 70 people stayed overnight to work on their project, said Sherry Jiang, one of the event organizers and the co-founder of fintech app Peek.\"We were trying to do a bit of a count ... And we found people in like random lecture rooms. It was just the funniest [thing] ... It was like catching wild Pokemon,\" said Jiang.Richard Lee, who built a gamified habits-training app Orbie alongside his teammate Amanda Lau Shernin, slept for only about half an hour on the floor of a lecture hall. He had prior developer experience and knows coding languages like Python and SQL.Participants of the hackathon ranged from highly experienced engineers to newbies.Courtesy of Nicholas ChengWhen asked why he chose to join the hackathon, he said: \"I took it as a personal challenge to see [what] could actually be done within 24 hours ... [and to] see how far vibe coding has advanced,\" said Lee. He also thought it would be a great place to get inspiration.\"It's like a gathering of builders ... who don't just learn, but do,\" Lee added. \"It's almost like training for a startup, right? Effectively, you just have to focus and get something done.\"By the end of the weekend, Lee says that although the hackathon was just 24 hours, he felt like he had \"significantly upgraded\" his skills.Bringing back the builder spiritThe hackathon's organizers said their goal was to reinvigorate the builder community in Singapore. There's a feeling among many people in the space that the hackathon scene has faded from its heyday, co-organizer Jiang said.Fellow organizer Singh agreed, writing on a LinkedIn post that \"the Singapore hackathon scene lost its soul.\"Singh, who has been attending hackathons since 2013, observed that such events used to center hackers and builders making \"something that worked\", instead of \"panels or sponsorship decks or photo ops.\"\"Now? Most AI events here feel hollow. Panels by people who've never touched the tech. 'Thought leadership' with no practical weight. People pretending to build, or worse, extracting revenue from the hype without caring about the ecosystem,\" he wrote.Major takeawaysWith the advancement of AI, the startup landscape and software engineering industry has changed massively — it's now easier for people with non-technical backgrounds to build tech products themselves.Out of all of the participants, about half of them were completely new to hackathons, Jiang said.Jiang also pointed out that some participants who had learned how to vibe code just a couple weeks ago had placed \"pretty high\" on the event's rankings, beating experienced engineers.\"This is a bit of a hypothesis I have ... I feel like people who [have a good] product sense and good taste and know how to position their products are starting to do really well at these hackathons because engineering is a lot easier now,\" she said. \"We've lowered the barrier, but raised the bar.\"The time to build is far shorter than [before]. I think it's really much easier for developers or technical people, or even non-technical people to build a prototype, and effectively get to market.Richard LeeHackathon participant\"The time to build is far shorter than [before]. I think it's really much easier for developers or technical people, or even non-technical people to build a prototype, and effectively get to market,\" said hackathon participant Lee.Additionally, Lee and Jiang agree that both startup teams and corporate developer teams will likely become smaller now that these AI-assisted coding tools are on the market.\"It's improving so fast that if [you] are not using [these tools] it day to day ... I think [you'll] be at a big risk of being eliminated.\"Richard LeeHackathon participantWith that said, it's still very helpful to have some background on software engineering, as this will carry you to the finish line. People will still need to know how to evaluate code in terms of its fundamental logic and understand how to address issues in code, hackathon participant Lee said.Ultimately, AI models are improving so quickly that if engineers aren't upskilling consistently on the tools and staying up to date, they are at risk of becoming redundant, he added.",

    "body": "Sopa Images | Lightrocket | Getty ImagesSocial media giant Reddit has launched a lawsuit against artificial intelligence company Perplexity, alleging that it illegally scraped user posts to train its AI model, marking the latest data-rights clash between content owners and the AI industry. The complaint filed in New York federal court on Wednesday also named three defendants, which Reddit says helped Perplexity collect its data: Lithuanian data scraper Oxylabs, \"former Russian botnet\" AWMProxy, and Texas startup SerpApi.Reddit alleged that the three smaller entities were able to extract its copyrighted content \"by masking their identities, hiding their locations and disguising their web scrapers as regular people.\"Perplexity, which runs an AI-powered search engine, denied the allegations and accused Reddit of \"extortion\" and opposition to an open internet, while SerpApi told CNBC it \"strongly disagrees\" with Reddit's claims and intends to defend itself in court. The case represents one of many filed by content owners accusing AI firms of using copyrighted material without permission to train their large language models. Reddit, in particular, has been on the front lines of that battle, having launched a similar ongoing lawsuit against AI startup Anthropic in June. CNBC was unable to reach Oxylabs and AWMProxy.In a statement shared with CNBC, Ben Lee, Chief Legal Officer at Reddit, said that AI companies are\" locked in an arms race for quality human content\" and that pressure has fueled an \"industrial-scale 'data laundering' economy.\"watch nowScrapers bypass technological protections to steal data, then sell it to clients hungry for training material. Reddit is a prime target because it's one of the largest and most dynamic collections of human conversation ever created.Reddit — which hosts over 100,000 interest-based \"subreddit\" communities — said in its lawsuit that its user posts had become the most commonly cited source for AI-generated answers on Perplexity. It added that it sent Perplexity a cease-and-desist letter, after which it increased the volume of citations to Reddit \"forty-fold.\"AI researchers have previously noted that Reddit's large volume of moderated conversations can help make AI chatbots produce more natural-sounding responses.In the age of artificial intelligence, Reddit has worked to leverage its massive data pool, permitting access to it only through AI-related licensing agreements. The social media company has signed such agreements with OpenAI and Alphabet's Google. In a response to the lawsuit, Perplexity, in a post on the Reddit platform, argued that it does not train AI models on content but merely summarizes and cites public Reddit discussions. Therefore, it said it is \"impossible\" to sign a license agreement.\"A year ago, after explaining this, Reddit insisted we pay anyway, despite lawfully accessing Reddit data. Bowing to strong arm tactics just isn't how we do business,\" the statement read, going on to describe the suit as a \"show of force in Reddit's training data negotiations with Google and OpenAI.\" \"Perplexity believes this is a sad example of what happens when public data becomes a big part of a public company's business model,\" Perplexity added, noting that data licensing has become an increasingly important source of revenue for Reddit. In February, Reddit's COO Jen Wong told the trade publication Adweek that AI licensing deals with Google and OpenAI made up nearly 10% of Reddit's revenue. ",

    "body": "Bank of Korea warned there's a chance of increased volatility following more rate hikes from the Fed, following U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jay Powell's speech in Jackson Hole. Photographer: SeongJoon Cho/Bloomberg via Getty ImagesBloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesSouth Korea's central bank kept its benchmark interest rate unchanged at 2.5% Thursday, extending a pause since May, as policymakers continued to flag household debt as a key risk.The decision was in line with expectations from economists polled by Reuters, and followed the introduction of tighter property measures in Seoul aimed at curbing borrowing.In a statement released Thursday, the Bank of Korea cited stable inflation and improving economic growth outlook as the main reasons to extend the pause, while flagging that it was monitoring stability in the housing market and household debt.\"Domestic demand is expected to continue its recovery, led by consumption, and exports are likely to remain favorable for some time owing to the strong semiconductor sector, the central bank said.Still, the BOK warned that uncertainties for the economic growth have increased due to the ongoing trade talks with the U.S., noting that the impacts of U.S. tariffs on exports are likely to \"expand gradually.\"The central bank's Monetary Policy Board said it will \"maintain its rate cut stance to mitigate downside risks to economic growth and adjust the timing and pace of any further Base Rate cuts.\"Household debt also remained a major concern for the BOK, which has been reluctant to cut rates for fear of fueling housing demand and pushing debt levels higher.On Oct. 15, South Korean media reported that stricter property rules, including tighter loan limits, will now apply across all 25 districts of Seoul, as well as 12 more areas in the surrounding Gyeonggi Province.Previously, the tightened rules only applied to four of Seoul's 25 districts.Bank of America analysts wrote in an Oct. 20 note that \"housing inflation in Seoul has been the top of mind for policymakers this year, a critical constraint for additional easing in 2H25.\"They noted that home prices in central Seoul accelerated again in mid-September, despite earlier rounds of cooling measures in June and September.\"With such measures, a sequential decline in home transactions is expected in coming months, but it is still hard to tell if the price increase could be fully contained, in our view,\" they said.The BofA economists, however, penciled in a rate cut by the BOK in November to bolster growth in the economy, particularly if progress is made in trade talks and housing policy.South Korea's Kospi index and the small-cap Kosdaq were flat following the announcement. The Korean won weakened 0.19% against the greenback to 1,434.70, its lowest level since May.The decision came as the central bank treads cautiously to avoid further depreciation of the won, which has weakened by over 4% in the last three months against the greenback, as trade negotiations with the U.S. dragged on.Stalled trade talksThe rate decision also came as South Korea faces uncertainty over its trade relationship with the U.S., after both sides struggled to finalize details of an agreement reached on July 30.Under the deal, the Asian nation is set to invest $350 billion in the U.S. in exchange for a lower tariff rate of 15% on its U.S.-bound shipments. South Korean President Lee Jae Myung warned in a Reuters interview that transferring the full amount in cash could trigger a financial crisis reminiscent of 1997.Tariffs on the country's auto exports will also be cut to 15%, according to the preliminary agreement.Negotiators are reportedly due to visit Washington this week to finalize terms ahead of the APEC Summit on Oct. 31 in South Korea.At its last meeting in August, the BOK raised its 2025 inflation forecast to 2% from its May forecast of 1.9%, while the GDP growth outlook for the year was also revised to 0.9% from 0.8% previously.Consumer inflation in South Korea climbed 2.1% in September from a year earlier, accelerating from a 1.7% rise in August, with core inflation advancing 2%.The BOK expects domestic demand to make a \"modest recovery,\" due to a supplementary budget and improvement in consumer sentiment.\"Exports are likely to show favorable movements for some time, but are likely to gradually slow as the impacts of U.S. tariffs expand,\" the central bank said.",

    "body": "Mark Zuckerberg, CEO of Meta Platforms.David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesMeta will lay off roughly 600 employees within its artificial intelligence unit as the company looks to reduce layers and operate more nimbly, a spokesperson confirmed to CNBC on Wednesday.The company announced the cuts in a memo from its chief AI officer, Alexandr Wang, who was hired in June as part of Meta's $14.3 billion investment in Scale AI. Workers across Meta's AI infrastructure units, Fundamental Artificial Intelligence Research unit (FAIR) and other product-related positions will be impacted.However, the cuts did not impact employees within TBD Labs, which includes many of the top-tier AI hires brought into the social media company this summer, people familiar with the matter told CNBC. Those employees, overseen by Wang, were spared by the layoffs, underscoring Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg's bet on his expensive hires versus the legacy employees, the people said.Within Meta, the AI unit was considered to be bloated, with teams like FAIR and more product-oriented groups often vying for computing resources, the people said. When the company's new hires joined the company to create Superintelligence Labs, it inherited the oversized Meta AI unit, they said. The layoffs are an attempt by Meta to continue trim the department and further cement Wang's role in steering the company's AI strategy.Meta has been aggressively overhauling its approach to AI in recent months as it works to keep pace with rivals like OpenAI and Google, pouring billions of dollars into infrastructure projects and recruitment.Following the cuts, Meta's Superintelligence Labs' workforce now sits at just under 3,000, the people said.Meta notified at least some employees on Wednesday that Nov. 21 is their termination date and, until then, they're in a \"non-working notice period.\"\"During this time, your internal access will be removed and you do not need to do any additional work for Meta,\" said the message, which was viewed by CNBC. \"You may use this time to search for another role at Meta.\"The company also said it's paying 16 weeks of severance plus two weeks for every completed year of service, \"minus your notice period.\"CEO Mark Zuckerberg had grown frustrated with Meta's progress in AI, especially after the release of its Llama 4 models in April received a lukewarm response from developers.Following Meta's massive investment in Scale AI, Zuckerberg unveiled a new unit called Meta Superintelligence Labs that's made up of top AI researchers and engineers. The group is led by Wang and former GitHub CEO Nat Friedman.During the company's second-quarter earnings call in July, Meta said it expects its total expenses for 2025 to come in the range of $114 billion to $118 billion, raising the low end of its previous outlook. That number is only expected to increase, as Meta said its AI initiatives will \"result in a 2026 year-over-year expense growth rate that is above the 2025 expense growth.\"Meta is scheduled to report third-quarter results next week.On Tuesday, Meta announced a $27 billion deal with Blue Owl Capital to fund and develop its massive Hyperion data center in rural Louisiana. The data center is expected to be large enough to cover a \"significant part of the footprint of Manhattan,\" Zuckerberg said in a post in July.Axios was first to report the layoffs.— CNBC's Salvador Rodriguez contributed to this reportWATCH: Megacap AI talent wars: Meta poaches another top Apple executivewatch now",

    "body": "General view of Orsknefteorgsintez oil refinery in the city of Orsk, Orenburg region, Russia Aug. 28, 2025.  Stringer | ReutersU.S. decision to sanction Russia's two largest oil companies threatens to disrupt the energy lifeline linking Moscow to its biggest customers in Asia, but without causing an immediate supply shock, industry experts told CNBC.The U.S. Treasury Department on Wednesday levied sanctions on Rosneft and Lukoil, citing Moscow's \"lack of serious commitment\" to ending the war in Ukraine. The sanctions aim to \"degrade\" Kremlin's ability to finance its war, the department said, signaling more measures could follow.The government has set Nov. 21 as the deadline for winding down operations, which means companies have nearly a month to wrap up or cancel existing deals with Rosneft and Lukoil. That seems to be designed to avoid causing immediate chaos in the oil markets while applying pressure on Russia, said Bob McNally, President of Rapidan Energy Group.Rosneft and Lukoil together account for roughly half of Russia's more than 4 million barrels a day of crude exports, volumes that have found steady homes in Asian markets since the West imposed a $60 price cap in late 2022, data provided by Vanda Insights showed. China imported about 2 million barrels per day of Russian oil in September, while India took around 1.6 million barrels per day.\"This is potentially a very significant escalation,\" said Muyu Xu, senior crude oil analyst at commodities data analytics firm Kpler. \"Trump's sanctions on Rosneft and Lukoil [will] have significant implications for Russian seaborne crude exports, potentially prompting major buyers to scale back purchases — if not halt them entirely — in the near term,\" she added.In India, the sanctions are expected to hit several refiners directly tied to Russian supply. India's state-run refiners — Indian Oil, Bharat Petroleum, Hindustan Petroleum as well as private giants such as Reliance Industries, HPCL-Mittal Energy Ltd., and Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC), are among those most exposed, Kpler data showed.Rosneft also owns nearly 50% of Nayara Energy Ltd., operator of the Vadinar refinery in Gujarat, and it may struggle with selling refined products, rather than obtaining crude.Indian state-run refiners are currently scrutinizing their Russian oil trade paperwork to confirm that none of their supplies originate directly from Rosneft or Lukoil, Reuters reported on Thursday, following the announcement of the sanctions, citing a source with direct knowledge of the situation.\"India will likely need to walk away from its seaborne term agreements, while China's pipeline flows may continue,\" said Vortexa's oil market analyst Emma Li.Refiners in China will also have to exercise caution, energy experts said. All the state-owned enterprises will be careful about cargoes linked to Rosneft and Lukoil, Xu said.China National Petroleum Corporation has agreements with Rosneft for pipeline supply, but no long-term contracts for seaborne crude, according to Vortexa.\"I don't expect a complete shutdown of Russian crude flows, but a short-term and immediate hiatus seems inevitable,\" said Xu.Sanctions mean buyers will need to find new ways to move and pay for those shipments, which brings about extra costs and complications, and that's exactly what the U.S. wants: to cut Moscow's profits without completely stopping its exports, said McNally.Indian Oil, Bharat Petroleum, Hindustan Petroleum, ONGC, Reliance Industries and China National Petroleum Corporation did not immediately respond to a CNBC's requests for comment.This is as high-profile as it gets and Washington cannot risk looking like a paper tiger.Vandana HariVanda InsightsChina and India will have little choice but to turn mostly to U.S. and OPEC supplies, noted energy experts. \"There is spare capacity within OPEC right now, especially Saudi Arabia. But the increased demand for the global non-sanctioned supply will raise prices,\" John Kilduff, partner at Again Capital.Oil prices jumped around 5% before paring gains slightly after Trump's announcement. Global benchmark Brent was trading 3.71% higher at $64.91 per barrel at 2.00 a.m. ET, Thursday, while U.S. crude had climbed 3.93% to $60.8.Founder of Vanda Insights, Vandana Hari, also said that the alternative for China and India was more Middle Eastern crude.The new measures differ sharply from the G7's earlier price-cap mechanism, which allowed Russian crude to flow as long as it was sold below $60 a barrel. \"This appears to imply that you cannot buy Russian crude oil regardless of the price,\" Kilduff said. \"It's a blanket ban.\"\"This is as high-profile as it gets and Washington cannot risk looking like a paper tiger,\" said Hari. \"But a far bigger question is whether the sanctions will sustain … One Trump-Putin phone call could turn the situation by 180 degrees again.\"",

We will not relent until the people of Ukraine have a just and lasting peace,\" von der Leyen said on Thursday.",

    "body": "A Kia Sportage automobile in the quality control inspection area at the Kia Slovakia sro plant in Zilina, Slovakia, on Friday, Oct. 27, 2023.Bloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesSlovakia, a small landlocked country in the heart of Europe, faces a perfect storm as it seeks to protect its enviable automotive reputation.From the establishment of the Bratislava Automobile Works (BAZ) in the early 1970s through to the fall of communism and its subsequent ascension to the European Union, Slovakia has positioned itself as the world's leading producer of cars per capita.Nicknamed \"Europe's Detroit,\" the mountainous nation of just 5.4 million has attracted major manufacturers such as Volkswagen, Stellantis, Kia and Jaguar Land Rover.Sweden's Volvo Cars is also poised to open an electric vehicle factory near Kosice in eastern Slovakia, representing the country's fifth manufacturing facility.Such is its dominance, Slovakia's auto industry currently accounts for roughly 11% of its gross domestic product, half of the country's industrial output and about one-tenth of its total employment.A multitude of challenges, from U.S. tariffs and Chinese competition to higher domestic taxes and a geopolitical shift away from the EU, threaten to undermine its standing as a world leader in car production, however.Matej Hornak, an analyst at Slovenská Sporiteľňa, Slovakia's largest bank, described Slovakia's auto sector as uniquely exposed to Trump's tariffs when compared to others in Central and Eastern Europe.That's because Slovakia's exports to the U.S. represent 4% of its total exports, Hornak said, with approximately 80% of that volume consisting of cars.Read moreZuzana Pelakova, director of the economy and business program at Globsec, a think tank based in Slovakia's capital of Bratislava, singled out U.S. tariffs as the top near-term risk to Slovakia's auto industry.\"The main immediate risk, more than the EV transition and all the other ones, is tariffs. This is a significant challenge,\" Pelakova told CNBC by telephone.\"I would say now, in the current situation, the U.S.-EU trade alliance has stabilized, and tariffs have been lowered to 15%, which is certainly better than the initial proposal but is still challenging,\" she added.The U.S. and EU agreed to a framework trade deal in July, with U.S. Donald Trump's administration imposing a blanket tariff of 15% on most EU goods. The agreement marked a significant reduction from Trump's threat to impose charges of 30% and almost halved the tariff rate on Europe's auto sector from 27.5%.Industry groups, which tentatively welcomed the trade deal, expressed deep concern about the costs associated with the new tariff reality.Workers install chassis components onto a Kia Ceed automobile on the assembly line at the Kia Slovakia sro plant in Zilina, Slovakia, on Friday, Oct. 27, 2023.Bloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty Images\"While a decline in U.S. demand poses a challenge for Slovak carmakers, they are simultaneously facing pressure in other markets as competition from Chinese manufacturers intensifies,\" Hornak told CNBC by email.\"U.S. tariffs are thus only one piece of the puzzle — the broader picture requires closer attention,\" he added.EV transitionSlovakia has suffered a couple of notable setbacks on the road to full electrification in recent months.Volkswagen opted for Portugal over Slovakia for its new electric ID.1 model, while Stellantis, which has the Trnava plant in western Slovkaia, picked Spain as its destination for a new EV.Nonetheless, Slovenská Sporiteľňa's Hornak said the country's car plants still appear to be competitive within their respective corporate groups for the allocation of EV production.There is a lack of targeted governmental and institutional support for the industry's transformation. In fact, the situation is quite the opposite.Matej HornakAnalyst at Slovenská SporiteľňaVolvo's upcoming EV plant in eastern Slovakia, for instance, represents \"one of the most significant investments in this field,\" Hornak said, with China's Gotion High Tech and Slovakian partner InoBat set to build an EV battery plant reflective of \"another key investment.\"\"On the other hand, there is a lack of targeted governmental and institutional support for the industry's transformation. In fact, the situation is quite the opposite: due to fiscal consolidation measures, the business environment in Slovakia is deteriorating,\" Hornak said.\"The increasing tax and levy burden on companies — such as the introduction of a transaction tax — further disadvantages domestic businesses in the international market,\" he added.Russian President Vladimir Putin (R) talks to Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico (L) during their bilateral meeting, September 2 2025, in Beijing, China.Contributor | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesPrime Minister Robert Fico's government has raised taxes and imposed new levies on financial transactions as part of a broader push to repair the country's troubled public finances. The measures, which stoked tensions within the ruling coalition, have been criticized by Slovakia's auto industry.Alexander Matusek, head of Slovakia's Automotive Industry Association (AIA SR), told Bloomberg in late May that Fico's government risked hurting the country's auto sector with tax rises, as well as a geopolitical shift away from major trading partners.A Slovakian government spokesperson did not respond to a CNBC request for comment.Strategic riskFico's government has been at odds with the EU's approach to Russian President Vladimir Putin's full-scale invasion of Ukraine.The Slovakian prime minister said earlier this month that he would refuse to support tougher EU energy sanctions against Russia unless the bloc first tackles rising energy costs and mounting pressure on the region's car industry.Thousands of people took to the streets of Bratislava last month to protest over a meeting between Fico and Putin, in an escalation of previous demonstrations over Fico's pro-Russia stance.Protesters hold signs and flags during the second anti-government protest in a row, in Kosice, Slovakia, on September 23, 2025.Anadolu | Anadolu | Getty Images\"The Slovak government's more accommodating stance toward Russia and its higher euroscepticism create additional uncertainty for Slovak companies, adding another layer of strategic risk to their planning,\" Hornak said.\"As a result, Slovakia is increasingly perceived by European leaders as a less reliable partner, which may negatively influence investment decisions — both from existing investors and potential new entrants,\" Hornak said.Europe's Detroit vs. Motor CityGlobsec's Pelakova said that while Slovakia's auto industry faces several challenges, comparisons to America's Motor City could do with some nuance.\"There's definitely challenges but not in a sense that it will derail the trajectory currently, which brings us back to the initial Detroit comparison, which I don't think we're headed to,\" Pelakova said.\"I would say there are two layers to that comparison because you can see that this is so significant and major carmakers were made in Detroit. Yes, that's a comparison that I agree with, and I think it's fair. But we know how Detroit ended about 30 to 40 years ago, so that bit, I wouldn't necessarily compare,\" she added.",

    "body": "A new residential complex under construction in Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province, China on October 20, 2025. Cfoto | Future Publishing | Getty ImagesBEIJING — Chinese policymakers are unlikely to shore up the country's struggling real estate sector, analysts told CNBC, even as the housing slump drags on economic growth.The assessment comes as China's top leaders, called the Central Committee, are due to wrap up a four-day meeting Thursday, which will outline priorities for the next five years.In Beijing's view, the property sector's drag on growth has eased, while technological development is a more urgent priority in the current geopolitical landscape, said Ning Zhu, author of \"China's Guaranteed Bubble.\" To him, that means Beijing is unlikely to enact significantly stronger real estate support.After years of concern over property developers' debt that led to Beijing's crackdown, Chinese state media said earlier this month that \"risks in key areas have been effectively prevented and mitigated,\" according to a CNBC translation. The piece was part of a series of articles highlighting achievements over the past five years while highlighting Beijing's push to promote opportunities in tech.That underscores further divergence between Beijing's view and that of most analysts.\"The government believes the property market is bottoming,\" Zhu said. \"I believe it is a gradual process and may take more time before reaching the bottom.\"watch nowRecent data underscores the divide between Beijing's optimism and market reality. China's Statistics Bureau on Monday said high-tech manufacturing grew by 9.6% in the first three quarters of the year compared to the same period in 2024, outpacing the 6.2% growth in overall industrial production.However, real estate investment fell 13.9% in the first three quarters from a year earlier, extending the sector's decline through September. The decline pushed fixed-asset investment into negative territory — the only such decline on record, excluding the Covid-19 pandemic.That means that just over a year since Beijing called for a \"halt\" in the property sector's decline, there are still few signs of a turnaround.It's \"hard to say when\" real estate will bottom, said Lulu Shi, a director at Fitch Ratings. \"The overall population, demographics and the employment situation and housing market inventory, they are all worsening.\"China's falling birth rate points to weaker housing demand in the future, while uncertainty about jobs and income growth weighs on homebuyer sentiment in the near term.Falling home pricesThe slide in property prices over roughly the last two years is also weighing on homebuyer sentiment, reversing decades of gains that once fueled heavy speculation in the property market.The weighted average for new home prices in September fell 2.7% from the prior month on an annualized basis, according to a Goldman Sachs analysis of official data from China's 70 largest cities published Monday. That was steeper than the 2.1% drop seen in August.Prices of \"secondary\" homes, which have already been sold once, have plunged by a far steeper 5% to 20% over the past year, Goldman said, citing a mix of official and third-party figures.Looking ahead, Beijing is unlikely to put much emphasis on property policy, whether in additional support or discouraging real estate speculation, said Bruce Pang, adjunct associate professor at CUHK Business School.He noted that China's multi-year plans, such as those for the next five years, tend to focus on new approaches for growth.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tWeekly analysis and insights from Asia's largest economy in your inbox\n\t\t\tSubscribe now\n\t\t\n\tEasing measures introduced in August, such as looser restrictions on multiple property purchases in major cities, have done little to lift sentiment. The policy changes mostly applied to the city outskirts rather than the most attractive downtown areas.Citing that weaker-than-expected policy support, S&P Global Ratings earlier this month forecast property sales to fall 8% this year, worse than earlier estimates. They expect another drop of at least 6% next year as a market bottom remains elusive.Moody's Ratings also predicts China home sales to decline by single digits over the next 12 to 18 months.This forecast is based on fading demand from buyers who had anticipated policy easing, said Daniel Zhou, an assistant vice president and analyst at Moody's Ratings. He said the property market should gradually stabilize over the longer term under existing policy measures.Broader economic impactThe real estate slump continues to weigh heavily on China's economy, even as the sector's role has shrunk from more than a quarter of output. As property sales have roughly halved in just a few years, manufacturing and exports have helped offset the decline.\"China's economy has remained under the 2-speed mode, with consumption/property as the weak track and exports/manufacturing as the strong track,\" Larry Hu, chief China economist at Macquarie, said in a note. \"The pattern will continue until policymakers could no longer rely on external demand to drive growth.\"Chinese exports have remained unexpectedly strong so far this year, with 8.3% growth in September from a year ago, despite a 27% plunge in shipments of goods to the U.S.For real estate, \"it is very hard to see a trend of growth,\" Shi said. \"We believe there will be more policies, but it's not likely that one policy can change the entire situation.\"Eventually, once the decline in home prices eases, she expects more buyers to gradually return to the housing market.",

    "body": "Steve Wozniak, co-founder of the technology company Apple.Thomas Banneyer | Picture Alliance | Getty ImagesA group of prominent figures, including artificial intelligence and technology experts, has called for an end to efforts to create 'superintelligence' — a form of AI that would surpass humans on essentially all cognitive tasks. Over 850 people, including tech leaders like Virgin Group founder Richard Branson and Apple cofounder Steve Wozniak, signed a statement published Wednesday calling for a pause in the development of superintelligence. The list of signatories was notably topped by prominent AI pioneers, including the computer scientists Yoshua Bengio and Geoff Hinton, who are widely considered \"godfathers\" of modern AI. Leading AI researchers like UC Berkeley's Stuart Russell also signed on. Superintelligence has become a buzzword in the AI world, as companies from Elon Musk's xAI to Sam Altman's OpenAI compete to release more advanced large language models. Meta notably has gone so far as to name its LLM division the 'Meta Superintelligence Labs.' But signatories of the recent statement warn that the prospect of superintelligence has \"raised concerns, ranging from human economic obsolescence and disempowerment, losses of freedom, civil liberties, dignity, and control, to national security risks and even potential human extinction.\"It called for a ban on developing superintelligence until there is strong public support for the technology and a scientific consensus that it can be built and controlled safely.In addition to AI and tech figures, the names behind the statement came from a broad coalition ranging from academics, media personalities, religious leaders and a bipartisan group of former U.S. politicians and officials. Those retired officials included former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Mike Mullen and former National Security Advisor Susan Rice.Meanwhile, Steve Bannon and Glenn Beck — influential media allies to U.S. President Donald Trump — were also prominently featured on the list.Chief Strategist to the President Steve Bannon speaks during the Semafor World Economy Summit 2025 at Conrad Washington on April 23, 2025 in Washington, DC. Kayla Bartkowski | Getty ImagesOther high-profile signatories included the British royal family members Prince Harry and his wife, Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, as well as former president of Ireland Mary Robinson. As of Wednesday, the list was still growing.AI doomers versus AI boomersThere has been a growing divide in the tech space between those who see AI as a powerful force for good, warranting unfettered development, and those who believe it's dangerous and in need of more regulation. However, as noted by the 'Statement on Superintelligence' signatory website, even the leaders of the world's leading artificial intelligence companies, such as Musk and Altman, have, in the past, warned about the dangers of superintelligence. Before becoming CEO of OpenAI, Altman wrote in a 2015 blog post that \"development of superhuman machine intelligence (SMI) is probably the greatest threat to the continued existence of humanity.\"watch nowMeanwhile, Elon Musk said on a podcast earlier this year that there was \"only a 20% chance of annihilation\" when discussing the risks of advanced AI surpassing human intelligence. The 'Statement on Superintelligence' cited a recent survey from the Future of Life Institute showing that only 5% of U.S. adults support \"the status quo of fast, unregulated\" superintelligence development. The survey of 2,000 American adults also found that a majority believe \"superhuman AI\" shouldn't be created until proven safe or controllable and want robust regulation on advanced AI. In a statement provided on the site, computer scientist Bengio said AI systems could surpass most individuals in most cognitive tasks within a few years. He added that while such advances could help solve global challenges, they also carry significant risks.\"To safely advance toward superintelligence, we must scientifically determine how to design AI systems that are fundamentally incapable of harming people, whether through misalignment or malicious use,\" he said. \"We also need to make sure the public has a much stronger say in decisions that will shape our collective future.\"",

However, earnings missed analyst estimates, pushing the stock down almost 5% in extended trading.Here's how the company did compared with estimates from analysts polled by LSEG:Earnings per share: 50 cents adjusted vs. 54 cents estimatedRevenue: $28.10 billion vs. $26.37 billion estimatedTotal revenue climbed from $25.18 billion a year earlier. Automotive revenue increased 6% to $21.2 billion from $20 billion in the year-ago period, Tesla said.Net income fell 37% to $1.37 billion, or 39 cents per share, from $2.17 billion, or 62 cents per share a year earlier. The profit drop reflected lower EV prices and a 50% increase in operating expenses, which the company said was in part due to artificial intelligence and \"other R&D projects.\"The end of the quarter coincided with the expiration of federal tax credits for electric vehicles, which were eliminated with President Donald Trump's spending bill. That pulled sales forward into the quarter as as consumers rushed to take advantage of the incentive before it went away.On Tesla's last earnings call in July, CEO Elon Musk and finance chief Vaibhav Taneja warned shareholders about the impact of higher tariff costs and the expiration of the tax credits.Revenue from automotive regulatory credits in the quarter fell 44% to $417 million from $739 million.Even with the return to overall growth, Tesla's third quarter was marked by a continuing sales slump in Europe, driven partly by consumer backlash against Musk, his incendiary political rhetoric and activism, as well by competition from EV makers like Volkswagen and BYD.The stock, which plummeted to start the year, has rallied back and is now up almost 9% in 2025. That still trails major indexes and most of its megacap peers.The shares dipped during the earnings call on Wednesday as executives offered very little guidance for investors to consider, with Musk instead repeating his grand futuristic visions. Of notable concern is the slow progress of the company's Full Self Driving system. Taneja said that customers paying for FSD Supervised, its partially automated system, account for only 12% of Tesla's current fleet.Tesla didn't give volume-specific guidance in its shareholder deck or on its call, but said it's still aiming to start \"volume production\" of the Cybercab, heavy duty electric Semi trucks and new, battery energy storage system, called Megapack 3, in 2026.Musk said on the call that he expects Cybercab production to begin in the second quarter.watch nowThe company also said it's now building out \"first generation production lines\" for the company's humanoid Optimus robots. Musk said Tesla expects to show its Optimus V3 in the first quarter.Tesla unveiled its fully electric Semi in November 2017. While the company has delivered some of these trucks to early customers, it still lists Semi production lines as \"under construction.\" Lars Moravy, a Tesla vice president, said on the call that the company has built out production lines, is still installing some equipment, and has a \"fleet of validation trucks on the road.\" However, Tesla is still working on making a version of its partially automated driving systems for the Semi.Instead of promising to deliver a certain number of EVs and energy products by the end of the year, Tesla said, \"It is difficult to measure the impacts of shifting global trade and fiscal policies on the automotive and energy supply chains, our cost structure and demand for durable goods and related services.\"Tesla said it grew its \"service area and fleet count\" for its Robotaxi service in Austin, which involves safety drivers on board, and launched its Bay Area ride-hailing service. The company said it's obtaining data that will allow it to \"quickly scale to other cities in the future\" with what it's calling a \"universal model.\"On the call, Musk said he expects Tesla to remove the human safety drivers from its Austin Robotaxi vehicles this year, and said the company should be operating the service in eight to 10 metro areas by the end of 2025. In new markets, Tesla initially plans to have safety drivers for at least three months. Earlier this month, Tesla reported deliveries of 497,099 vehicles for the third quarter, a record, on total production of 447,450 vehicles. However, through the first three quarters, deliveries stood at around 1.2 million, down about 6% compared to the same period of 2024.Tesla also debuted more affordable versions of its popular Model Y SUV and Model 3 sedan in early October. The company said on Wednesday that the new offerings make \"our products more accessible to customers in the wake of the expiration of the EV tax credit in the U.S.\"The company's biggest growth engine in the quarter was its energy generation and storage business, which saw revenue jump 44% to $3.42 billion. Tesla's energy products include large backup batteries and solar photovoltaics that can power datacenters and other facilities. Tesla's energy business now represents about one-quarter of its overall revenue.Musk's AI startup xAI, which he started in 2023, has been a big buyer of Tesla's energy products. In its 2024 annual report, Tesla said xAI incurred expenses of about $198.3 million for the year and $36.9 million through February of 2025. Most of that was for Tesla's Megapack products.Investor relations head Travis Axelrod twice refused to read shareholder questions on the call that were about future products, saying in the first instance that \"this is not the appropriate venue to cover that.\"WATCH: Tesla reports revenue beatwatch now",

    "body": "Elon Musk listens as reporters ask U.S. President Donald Trump and South Africa President Cyril Ramaphosa questions during a press availability in the Oval Office at the White House on May 21, 2025 in Washington, DC. Chip Somodevilla | Getty ImagesThere was a lot missing from Tesla's third-quarter earnings call.CEO Elon Musk said nothing about demand for the company's electric vehicles after a key federal tax credit expired last month. There was no mention of the Cybertruck or the impact of tariffs on auto parts. Investors got no sign for how the fourth quarter is shaping up. That all helps explain why the stock sank almost 4% in extended trading. Rather than focus on sales, margins and earnings (which missed estimates), Musk took a familiar path, making bold promises and laying out his futuristic vision for the business. It starts with robotaxis, and Musk's view that skeptical investors and much of the public fail to see what's coming. \"People just don't don't quite appreciate the degree to which this will take off — where it's honestly — it's going to be like a shock wave,\" Musk said in his opening remarks. \"We have millions of cars out there that, with a software update, become full self-driving cars and, you know, we're making a couple million a year.\"Musk has for years promised that Tesla's EVs will be able to do work for their owners, making them money while they sleep by ferrying passengers or goods around without a driver. But while Alphabet's Waymo is aggressively entering new markets with its commercial robotaxi service, and Baidu's Apollo Go is taking off in China and elsewhere, Tesla is still limited to a few pilot projects. During Tesla's prior earnings call in July, Musk predicted that the company would have autonomous ride hailing available to \"probably half the population of The U.S. by the end of the year.\"  The company still doesn't produce or sell cars that are safe to use without a human ready to steer or brake at all times.watch nowOn Wednesday, Musk said Tesla would have its robotaxi service operating without human drivers in Austin by the end of the year and that it would be running in eight to 10 cities by the close of 2025, at least with drivers on board.As for its current fleet of cars, finance chief Vaibhav Taneja said on the call that the customer base for FSD Supervised, Tesla's partially automated driving system, \"is still small,\" with 12% of users paying for the system. Taneja didn't offer an average sale price that subscribers are paying after Tesla ran a number of promotions to drive uptake. Tesla said in its investor deck that FSD revenue was lower than in the year-ago period, when the figure was $326 million. That means FSD accounted for less than 2% of total revenue in the latest quarter. After robotaxis, Musk turned to humanoid robots, repeating his prediction that Optimus has the \"potential to be the biggest product of all time.\"Optimus is Tesla's bipedal humanoid robot that's in development but not yet commercially deployed. Musk has previously said the robots will be so sophisticated that they can serve as factory workers or babysitters. Now he's raising the bar. \"Optimus will be an incredible surgeon,\" Musk said on Wednesday. He said that with Optimus and self driving, \"you can actually create a world where there is no poverty, where everyone has access to the finest medical care.\"Musk said Tesla will likely demo a new version of Optimus, which he called V3, in the first quarter of 2026.At the end of the call, Musk kept the focus on robots but combined it with another topic of importance: his pay package. A Tesla Optimus robot scoops popcorn and waves at attendees during the opening of the Tesla Diner and drive-in restaurant and supercharger on Santa Monica Blvd. in the Hollywood neighborhood of Los Angeles on July 21, 2025.Patrick T. Fallon | Afp | Getty ImagesIn September, Tesla introduced a new pay plan that could be worth $1 trillion and increase Musk's stake in the company by 12%. Tesla will hold its annual shareholder meeting in early November, when the plan will be up for a vote.\"If we build this robot army, do I have at least a strong influence over that robot army?\" Musk said on the call. \"I don't feel comfortable building that robot army if I don't have at least a strong influence.\"He also took aim at proxy advisors Institutional Shareholder Services and Glass Lewis after the firms recommended shareholders vote against approving his new pay plan.Musk said ISS and Glass Lewis \"have no freaking clue,\" and described them as \"corporate terrorists.\"Representatives from the two firms didn't immediately respond to requests for comment. In the meantime, Tesla still relies on auto sales for the vast majority of its revenue. And while revenue increased 12% in the third quarter from a year earlier, that followed two straight year-over-year declines, and analysts expect a drop of about 2% in the fourth quarter. Absent from the call was any discussion of what Tesla may be doing in the near term to restore consumer enthusiasm.Tesla's brand ranking declined to the 25th spot on the Interbrand 2025 Best Global Brands list out earlier this month, from 12th in 2024. The report said that \"Tesla was once the main disruptive force in the automotive industry,\" but Musk's political activities along with a lack of new products \"has led to concerns about Tesla's ability to sustain high margins.\"Through Tesla's online forum, investors submitted questions about new products in the pipeline. But on the call, investor relations lead Travis Axelrod twice refused to read them. \"This is not the appropriate venue to cover that,\" he said.

    "body": "Peter Endig | AFP | Getty ImagesThe New Jersey attorney general sued Amazon on Wednesday, alleging the company has violated the rights of thousands of pregnant employees and staffers with disabilities who work in several of its facilities in the state.The complaint, filed in Essex County Superior Court by the office of Attorney General Matthew Platkin, alleges Amazon violated state anti-discrimination law in how it treats pregnant employees and employees with disabilities when they request a work accommodation.The state said the lawsuit follows a years-long investigation by its civil rights division into Amazon's treatment of workers at warehouses across New Jersey.According to the suit, the state's investigation found that since October 2015, Amazon allegedly violated pregnant and disabled employees' rights by placing them on unpaid leave when they request accommodations, denied them reasonable accommodations and \"unreasonably\" delayed its responses to workers' requests.It also alleged that Amazon \"unlawfully\" retaliates against these workers when they seek an accommodation, including by firing them. After workers are granted an accommodation, Amazon allegedly fired some employees for \"failing to meet the company's rigid productivity requirements.\"Read more CNBC tech newsCoreWeave CEO says Core Scientific 'not a need to have' as shareholder opposition to deal risesOpenAI investor Reid Hoffman spars with AI czar Sacks, calls Anthropic 'one of the good guys'OpenAI cracks down on Sora 2 deepfakes after pressure from Bryan Cranston, SAG-AFTRATransportation Secretary Duffy says Musk's SpaceX is behind on moon trip and he will reopen contracts\"There is no excuse for Amazon's shameful treatment of pregnant workers and workers with disabilities,\" Platkin said in a statement. \"Amazon's egregious conduct has caused enormous damage to pregnant workers and workers with disabilities in our state, and it must stop now.\"Amazon spokesperson Kelly Nantel said in a statement that accusations it doesn't follow federal and state laws like New Jersey's anti-discrimination law are \"simply not true.\"\"Ensuring the health and well-being of our employees is our top priority, and we're committed to providing a safe and supportive environment for everyone,\" Nantel said.The company said it approves more than 99% of pregnancy accommodation requests submitted by workers. Amazon also denied placing pregnant workers automatically on leave, as well as claims that it unjustifiably rejects accommodation requests.The complaint seeks to require that Amazon pay unspecified compensatory damages and civil fines, as well as court orders requiring the company to adjust its policies and to submit to monitoring and reporting requirements for five years, among other remedies.One incident described in the complaint states that an unnamed pregnant employee received an accommodation that permitted her to take additional breaks and restricted her from lifting items heavier than 15 pounds.Less than a month after the accommodation was approved, she was allegedly terminated for \"not meeting packing numbers,\" the lawsuit states, even though her accommodation required her pack fewer items each shift.In another case, a pregnant employee's accommodation request was closed due to a lack of medical paperwork when the requested documents weren't required. While the worker tried to resubmit her request, she allegedly received three warnings for \"poor productivity,\" and was ultimately fired for \"not making rate,\" according to the complaint.Amazon's internal investigation of her case didn't confirm that the employee was fired due to her pregnancy, but the company ultimately reinstated her with backpay, the lawsuit says.watch nowAmazon said in a statement that it doesn't have fixed quotas at its facilities, adding that it assesses performance \"based on safe and achievable expectations and take into account time and tenure, peer performance, and adherence to safe work practices.\"\"Amazon's discriminatory practices and systemic failure to accommodate pregnant workers and workers with disabilities have the effect of pushing these employees out of Amazon's workforce -- the precise outcome the [Law Against Discrimination] was intended to prevent,\" according to the lawsuit.Amazon's treatment of pregnant employees and others in its sprawling front-line workforce has come under scrutiny in the past.The company, which is the nation's second-largest private employer, has faced lawsuits from workers at its warehouses, who alleged the company failed to accommodate them once they were pregnant, then fired them for failing to meet performance standards, CNET reported.The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission last year opened a probe into Amazon's treatment of pregnant workers in its warehouses after six senators urged it to do so, citing a \"concerning pattern of mistreatment.\"New York's Division of Human Rights in 2022 filed a complaint against Amazon alleging it discriminates against pregnant workers and workers with disabilities at its facilities.Amazon said it doesn't comment on ongoing litigation.",

    "body": "Sopa Images | Lightrocket | Getty ImagesWestern Alliance, one of the regional banks at the center of concerns over loans made to non-bank financial players, said Wednesday it believes the loan that sparked last week's selloff is an isolated case.The bank reported third-quarter earnings Tuesday afternoon and noted it had set aside $30 million in reserves for possible losses on a $98 million loan made to the Cantor Group. Last week, Western Alliance disclosed that it had sued the borrowers behind the Cantor Group for alleged fraud related to the collateral for the loans.\"While incredibly frustrating, we believe this is a one-off issue in our note finance business and have adjusted our onboarding and ongoing portfolio monitoring practices,\" Western Alliance CEO Kenneth Vecchione told analysts on Wednesday.Shares of Western Alliance rose almost 2% in midday trading.Regional banks are getting a reprieve this week after Western Alliance and Zions, which also had exposure to the alleged loan fraud, reported results that didn't include any new loan meltdowns. Each of the banks posted rising hauls from net interest income on lower funding costs, while some of their metrics around credit quality actually improved from previous quarters.The Cantor Group episode forced Western Alliance to review other loans in its note finance portfolio, Vecchione said Wednesday.\"Today we have reverified titles and liens for all notes greater than $10 million and have found no irregularities,\" he said.Analysts grilled Vecchione during the Wednesday call for more details around the bank's loan collateral and lending to non-depository financial institutions, or NDFIs.\"What are you doing to validate your collateral and safeguard against future frauds?\" Autonomous Research analyst Casey Haire asked. \"It just seems like as long as you're not afraid to go to jail, it seems easy to double pledge collateral.\"Besides the recent review, Western Alliance periodically checks collateral to make sure the bank is still in a position to collect if the loan sours, executives said. Much of the bank's NDFI book is tied to residential mortgages, which Western Alliance considers low-risk, they added.'Can't unsee'Western Alliance is also exposed to another recent blowup, the bankruptcy of the auto parts maker First Brands.But in this case, a loan facility made to a fund managed by a subsidiary of the investment bank Jefferies \"remains current, and we continue to receive principal and interest payments as modeled,\" said Vecchione.While this week's reassurances have calmed markets for now, the sharp selloff in regionals last week is leaving a lasting mark on the industry. Shares of both Western Alliance and Zions plunged on Thursday after the banks disclosed problems with the Cantor Group.Investors are ready to hit \"sell\" on any signs that the losses aren't isolated, and share gains for the group will be capped for the foreseeable future because of these worries, said Timur Braziler, who covers mid-cap banks for Wells Fargo. He cut his recommendation on Western Alliance to \"sell\" on September 29.\"You can't unsee these events,\" Braziler said in an interview. \"The timer for any kind of sustainable outperformance within the regional group has gotten reset once again.\"",

    "body": "Cfoto | Future Publishing | Getty ImagesBeyond Meat shares closed lower Wednesday, erasing a triple-digit gain, as the meme stock rally faltered.The food company known for its plant-based burgers and sausages fell 1.1% on Wednesday, after surging 112% at one point in the session. The stock reached a high of $7.69 during the session, after closing Tuesday at $3.62. It ended Wednesday's session at $3.58.It's the latest in a volatile week for the company. On Monday, the stock rallied more than 127% after Roundhill Investments, which develops thematic ETFs, added the name to its Roundhill Meme Stock ETF (MEME).That decision appeared to have the added effect of driving a short squeeze in the stock, as investors rushed to cover their positions. According to FactSet data, more than 63% of the shares available for trading were sold short.On Tuesday, Beyond Meat soared 146% in its best day ever, after saying it will expand distribution at Walmart's stores.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconBeyond Meat, year-to-date performanceShares of Beyond Meat have been under pressure for a long time. After making its public debut in 2019, when the name soared past $230 per share, it has since become a penny stock. The shares have slid in each of the last five years, falling more than 47% in 2021, 81% in 2022, 27% in 2023, and 57% in 2024. The name is down more than 3% in 2025.The latest bad news for the stock came last week, when shares tumbled more than 67% to end the week at just 65 cents after Beyond Meat said it has finalized a debt deal.This week's comeback, however, is reminiscent of the height of the pandemic, when retail traders took on online message boards such as Reddit's WallStreetBets to coordinate moves behind high-risk, aggressive trades.In 2021, Bank of America said Beyond Meat was a Reddit stock to watch, though it ended that same year with losses.The return of Beyond Meat could be the latest signal of a frothy market, one that is relentlessly climbing higher in spite of concerns around elevated valuations and a possible artificial intelligence bubble. Indeed, Roundhill shut its meme ETF down at one point because of lack of interest. It revived it earlier this month as retail traders dove back into the bull market.In response to someone on WallStreetBets saying they bought 10,000 shares of Beyond Meat for $7.50, one commenter wrote earlier Wednesday, \"Youre already down 7k, impressive.\"Another posted: \"You know the economy is cooked when BYND stock is making a comeback.\"",

    "body": "There's no way to walk through New York City's Flatiron district without seeing The Flatiron Building. It first opened in 1902 and has been part of the city's fabric ever since. And for the first time in 124 years, if you have the money, you can call it home.Formerly a commercial building, the Flatiron Building is being converted into 38 luxury condominiums, with a full completion scheduled for later this year. Apartments in the building range from three-bedroom units selling for around $10.95 million to the penthouse on the 21st floor going for over $50 million. Corcoran Sunshine is leading sales and marketing for all of the apartments, which were designed by Studio Sofield. \"Very few buildings in the world elicit an emotional response like The Flatiron Building and reimagining this iconic landmark as residential homes has been an exciting and deeply meaningful experience; one we approach with great care and respect,\" William Sofield, designer and founder of Studio Sofield, tells CNBC Make It via email. There are currently two four-bedroom, four-bathroom units available, priced from $16 million to $18.9 million. Others are set to become available later this year, with three-quarters of the building expected to be done by July. The 11th floor apartment spans 3,828 square feet and occupies two corners of the building.Courtesy of The Flatiron BuildingThe first is an 11th-floor unit that went on the market on Jan. 24 for $16 million. It spans 3,828 square feet and occupies two corners of the building, offering south, east and west exposures. The standout feature is the great room, measuring 58 feet by 21 feet, with 10-foot ceilings. \"You're in a historic building looking at historic facades. It gets tremendous light because it's southwest facing,\" James Lansill, senior managing director at Corcoran Sunshine Marketing Group, tells CNBC Make It. The second apartment is on the sixth floor and listed for $18.9 million. It spans 4,654 square feet with a great room measuring more than 63 feet by 26 feet. It also has an additional half bathroom. The unit offers views of Madison Square Park, up to Fifth Avenue and Broadway.One of the facing points of the apartment has views of Madison Square Park.Courtesy of The Flatiron BuildingLansill says the Flatiron Building apartments are special because each unit has subtle differences from its peers. \"Each one has a personality and that personality can be informed by the historical trim that surrounds the outside of the window,\" he says. \"What was modern about The Flatiron Building in 1902 is still what's modern about it today. The reimagined interiors reflect a love of craftsmanship, texture, and history. We carefully considered what kind of design would best honor the site's integrity and its place within the city,\" Sofield says. The sixth floor apartment spans 4,654 square feet with a great room measuring over 63 feet by 26 feet.Courtesy of The Flatiron BuildingThe Flatiron Building conversion began in 2023 and is a redevelopment led by the Brodsky Organization and the Sorgente Group.\"It's been a thrilling process because the building has this historical and architectural interest, but it also has this iconic shape,\" Lansill says. Landsill adds that because the building was designed for commercial use, it took the team about eight months to develop a concept that made sense. They eventually landed on two units per floor — a north and south apartment — plus two full-floor units on floors 20 and 21. Some of the amenities include a 60-foot lap pool, fitness center, billiards rooms and a piano lounge.Courtesy of The Flatiron BuildingPart of the conversation meant adding 21st-century amenities, including a wellness center, fitness center, sports simulator, lounge, 60-foot lap pool, billiards rooms and a piano lounge. The building also offers residents private storage and wine cellars for an extra fee. At the time of reporting, four apartments in the building have already sold, according to Lansill.

Experts typically recommend a couple considerations before taking that risk.Those considerations include a strong business plan — clearly stating what the product or service is, who'll buy it and the money you'll be making — and enough money to sustain yourself as you establish your business, according to Kevin Lao, a certified financial planner and founder of advising firm Imagine Financial Security. Lao saved up a year's worth of living expenses and three months of business expenses before launching his firm, he told CNBC in January 2022. And he was clear on his company's vision, he added.\"It's very hard to be successful if you don't have a very compelling 'why,'\" Lao said.For John, his waiter job — though it wasn't glamorous — set the foundation for his approach to entrepreneurship and taught him an important lesson, he wrote.\"People don't realize it, but sometimes the day job is your first investor,\" John wrote. \"Don't get discouraged if you don't have the means to quit your job right away.

Ethereum slid about 9% to $2,445.31, while Solana lost 9.9% at $105.50.The slide in crypto comes in the wake of Trump's selection of Kevin Warsh to lead the Fed, which bolstered the U.S. dollar as it eased concerns about the central bank's independence. Dollar strength may reduce bitcoin's appeal among investors as an alternative currency.If confirmed by the U.S. Senate, Warsh would replace sitting Chairman Jerome Powell. Powell's current term as chair ends in May. Trump has criticized Powell — particularly about his unwillingness to reduce interest rates — almost since the Fed chair took the job in 2018.The slide in crypto is the latest blow to retail investors, who were buffeted by a sharp selloff in spot silver on Friday, the worst day for the market since March 1980.

    "description": "For most of the past two decades, the majority of electric vehicle-related investments have gone to Republican-led districts, especially in the Southe",
    "body": "For most of the past two decades, the majority of electric vehicle-related investments have gone to Republican-led districts, especially in the Southeast. With the industry pulling back from electric cars and trucks, the fate of those investments is now an open question. Automakers and battery makers invested more $200 billion in EV and battery manufacturing facilities in the U.S. from roughly 2000 to 2024, according to data and policy research firm Atlas Public Policy. About 84% of battery investments went to Republican-led districts, as well as 62% of EV manufacturing investments, the firm said. These were expected to create more than 200,000 jobs, 77% of which would be in Republican districts.Almost half of all that investment — 40% — went to the Southeastern U.S., according to Atlas. For more than half a century, the South has become a manufacturing hub for the automotive industry, but the EV push yielded some of the biggest investments in the history of the region.Then federal incentives for EVs enacted through the Biden-era Inflation Reduction Act were stripped away, and sales fell short of expectations. The companies that can are pivoting to other types of vehicles or entirely different products to avoid losses and layoffs. Hyundai MetaplantThe Hyundai Metaplant is seen on Sept. 9, 2025, in Ellabell, Georgia.   Elijah Nouvelage | AFP | Getty ImagesHyundai Motor Group is one of the automakers making changes after an EV push.The group, which includes the Hyundai, Genesis and Kia brands, was for a time the No. 2 seller of EVs in the country after Tesla, according to José Muñoz, CEO of Hyundai Motor Company.But the end of federal incentives for EVs was immediately followed by a dramatic drop in sales. Overall, HMG's EV sales were growing in the first quarter. By the fourth quarter, they had fallen 50%. \"We still do better than the industry,\" Munoz said, \"But it had an impact in the industry, which we could clearly see in the fourth quarter.\"Hyundai has long had a large factory in Montgomery, Alabama, but the company made an unprecedented bet on a $12.6 billion EV factory and joint battery ventures outside Savannah, Georgia, when it announced it in 2022.The Hyundai Metaplant, as it is called, was the largest investment in Georgia's history, taking the title from Rivian's $5 billion factory outside Atlanta. Hyundai estimated the plant would hire about 8,500 workers by 2031, with another 6,900 at nearby suppliers. As of January, the company had hired about 1,440. In 2024, Georgia led the nation in EV manufacturing investment, according to Atlas. Its Republican governor, Brian Kemp, had said he wanted to make the state the \"electric mobility capital\" of the United States. Hyundai's Metaplant factory was originally intended solely for EV production. The company actually sped up construction so its critically acclaimed — and, for an EV, strong-selling — Ioniq5 crossover would be eligible for the federal $7,500 EV tax credit. The Inflation Reduction Act required that EVs be assembled in the U.S. and have a minimum U.S. parts content to qualify. But the \"One Big Beautiful Bill\" took those credits away, as of Sept. 30. As a result, Hyundai announced an additional $2.7 billion investment in Metaplant to increase production by 200,000 units, targeting an annual output of half a million cars. It is now planning a mix of 10 hybrids and EVs, and Munoz expects sales volumes will be about 30% EVs and 70% hybrid and gas. Write-downsHaig Partners managing director John Murphy has estimated that automakers in the U.S. will likely face at least $100 billion in write-downs on their EV investments, meaning those investments are unlikely to yield the expected profits — or any profits at all. \"It's the single biggest capital allocation mistake in the history of the automotive industry,\" Murphy said.It's already started. Ford said in December it will take a $19.5 billion charge on its EV business, which has not turned a profit, while crosstown rival General Motors said it will take a $7.6 billion charge. International automakers such as Honda, Porsche and Volvo have all warned investors of similar charges of at least a billion dollars. Muñoz told CNBC he does not expect Hyundai have write-downs. A key Hyundai strategy is flexibility — making 10 models in single plant — as it plans to do in Metaplant, or even 12 in its soon-to-open factory in Ulsan, South Korea, which has given it the ability to pivot as market conditions change. \"The more flexibility you have, the less issues you have with changes in the environment,\" he said. \"So I think, knock on wood, I don't think we're going to see these types of write-offs that we've seen with other competitors.\"EV sales forecasts are a fraction of what the industry was expecting just a few years ago. The Biden administration wanted 50% of new car sales to be EVs by 2030. \"That was the target,\" said Peter Tadros, president of North America powertrain solutions for Bosch, the world's largest automotive supplier. \"Then, over the years, it dropped to 35, to 25, to 17. So now we're at 17% projection for 2030. So a huge, huge gap from the initial projection.\"Bosch had made a $250 million investment in its factory in Charleston, South Carolina, which included plans for an electric motors division. \"Now the investment was not made for 50% market, but it was not made also for 17%,\" Tadros said.That means the company has had to adjust. Bosch was able to move nearly all employees from the EV motors division to other departments. The factory also produces safety devices such as electronic stability control and fuel injection systems — which it expects to be in greater demand as the market pivots back to gas-burning vehicles. Still, the bet it made on EVs did \"cause some pain,\" Tadros said. \"You're stranded with this equipment, not producing as many as it should be producing to make up for this depreciation,\" Tadros said. \"So it's here. It's ready to go. We look forward to making a lot more motors in the future. But right now, it's a difficult situation for that segment.\"Watch the video to learn more.",

    "body": "Kraft Heinz announced plans to split into two separately traded companies, reversing its 2015 megamerger, which was orchestrated by billionaire investor Warren Buffett. Justin Sullivan | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesBig Food is slimming down. As both consumers and regulators push back against ultra-processed foods, the companies that make them have been splitting up or divesting iconic brands. Last year, Unilever spun off its ice cream business into The Magnum Ice Cream Company. Kraft Heinz is preparing to break up later this year, undoing much of the merger forged more than a decade ago by Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway and private equity firm 3G Capital. And Keurig Dr Pepper is planning a similar split after it finishes its acquisition of JDE Peet's. In 2024, nearly half of mergers and acquisitions activity in the consumer products industry came from divestitures, according to consulting firm Bain. Over the next three years, 42% of M&A executives in the consumer products industry are preparing an asset for sale, a Bain survey found.Of course, the trend isn't confined to just the consumer packaged goods industry. Industrial companies like GE and Honeywell have pursued their own breakups in recent years. It's happening too in legacy media; Comcast spun off many of its cable assets into CNBC owner Versant, while Warner Bros. Discovery is planning to spin off its cable networks later this year as Netflix acquires its streaming and studios division.\"In many of the spaces that we're seeing this type of activity, there are many very fierce competitive pressures that are making it harder to operate,\" said Emilie Feldman, a professor at The Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania.The squeeze on packaged food and beverage companies comes from lower demand, which has led to shrinking volume for many of their products. To turn around their businesses and win back investors, they are counting on dumping underperforming brands. February will bring both quarterly earnings reports and presentations at the annual CAGNY Conference, offering investors more opportunities to hear about food executives' plans for their portfolios. Companies to watch include Kraft Heinz, which could share more details on its upcoming split, and Nestle, which is considering selling off multiple brands in its portfolio.Cases of Dr. Pepper are displayed at a Costco Wholesale store on April 27, 2025 in San Diego, California.Kevin Carter | Getty ImagesShrinking salesFor more than a decade, consumers have been buying fewer groceries from the inner aisles of the grocery store, instead focusing on the outer aisles with fresh produce and protein. The pandemic served as the exception, as many consumers returned to the brands that they knew. However, price hikes and \"shrinkflation\" as life eased back to normal largely erased that shift in behavior.More recently, regulators, emboldened by the \"Make America Healthy Again\" agenda espoused by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., have put both more pressure and a bigger spotlight on processed foods. And the rise of GLP-1 drugs to combat diabetes and obesity have meant some of food companies' key consumers have lost their appetite for the sweet and salty snacks that they used to eat.As a percentage of overall spending, the consumer packaged goods industry has held onto its market share. But the biggest companies are losing customers to upstart brands or private-label products, according to Bain partner Peter Horsley.On average, about 35% of large consumer products companies' portfolios are in categories with more than 7% growth, Horsley said. For comparison, over half of private-label brands are in high-growth categories, like yogurt and functional beverages, and for insurgent brands, it's even higher. For Big Food, the result has been slowing — or even declining — sales, followed by stock declines. In some cases, activist investors push for companies to focus more on their core offerings and to offload so-called distractions. \"You're seeing a lot of pressure from a valuation standpoint, especially for these publicly traded companies,\" said Raj Konanahalli, partner and managing director of AlixPartners. \"One way to reset expectations is to really kind of focus more on the core offerings and dispose or divest the slower, capital-intensive or non-core businesses.\"While getting bigger helped food companies develop scale, enter new markets and grow their sales, it also made their businesses much more complex, according to Konanahalli. Become too big, and it becomes too difficult to make decisions quickly or to decide how and where to invest back into the business.To be sure, some of these divestitures and breakups follow deals that seem to have been ill-advised from the start. Look no further than the merger of Keurig Green Mountain and Dr Pepper Snapple Group in 2018, to form Keurig Dr Pepper. \"Frankly the surprise to us was the decision back in 2018 when Keurig Green Mountain acquired the Dr Pepper Snapple Group in an $18.7 billion deal to create Keurig Dr Pepper in the first place,\" Barclays analysts Patrick Folan and Lauren Lieberman wrote in a note to clients in August when the breakup was announced. \"At the time, it was seen as both odd and a very left field deal with the questionable logic of combining coffee and [carbonated soft drinks].\"(When the merger was announced in 2018, Lieberman said on a conference call with executives from both companies that she was still \"scratching my head\" about the logic of the deal for both players).Shares of Keurig Dr Pepper have risen 37% since the merger. The S&P 500 has climbed 150% over the same period.To sell or not to sellLike many industries, the packaged food industry has gone through cycles of expansion and contraction, according to Feldman. For example, Kraft spun off a snacking business that includes Oreos into Mondelez in 2012, just three years before it merged with Heinz.However, in recent years, expanding through acquisitions has required more sophisticated thinking and execution.\"If you go back to those glory years of pre-2015, the rules of the game in consumer products felt fairly simple, at least if you're a global company,\" Bain's Horsley said. \"You bought another company that was relatively similar to you. You integrated it together, you pulled out the cost synergies ... and then that gave you good top-line and bottom-line growth. But the rules of the game have changed.\"Around 2015, upstarts like Chobani or BodyArmor began stealing market share from legacy brands. As a result, food giants needed to become more thoughtful about what they were acquiring and how they were managing their portfolios, according to Horsley. For a cautionary tale, look no further than Kraft Heinz, formed by a mega-merger in 2015. Investors initially cheered the deal, but their enthusiasm waned as the combined company's U.S. sales began lagging. Then came write-downs of many of its iconic brands, like Kraft, Oscar Mayer, Maxwell House and Velveeta, in addition to a subpoena from the Securities and Exchange Commission related to its accounting policies and internal controls.With the benefit of hindsight, analysts and investors have blamed much of Kraft Heinz's downward spiral on the brutal cost-cutting strategy imposed after the merger. The company's leadership was too focused on slashing costs and not enough on investing back into its brands, particularly at a time when consumer tastes were changing.Since Kraft Heinz began trading as one company, shares have tumbled 73%. But not everyone is sold that getting rid of underperforming brands will benefit shareholders.\"If you don't fix the underlying capability, it doesn't matter how many brands you sell or don't sell,\" RBC Capital Markets analyst Nik Modi said. \"They're not addressing the root problem. It's just something to make investors happy because it seems like they're making a change.\"One breakup that Modi agrees with is that of Kellogg, which split into the snacks-focused Kellanova and cereal-centric WK Kellogg in 2023. Last year, chocolatier Ferrero snapped up WK Kellogg for $3.1 billion, while Mars closed its $36 billion acquisition of Kellanova.From Modi's perspective, the breakup created more value for shareholders than the combined business did. Kellogg's high-growth snack business was much more viable as an acquisition target without the sluggish cereal division attached. Plus, the two strategic buyers are both privately held companies that don't have to worry about sharing quarterly earnings with the public.Some investors are hoping for the same outcome with Kraft Heinz.\"The view that many have had is the best way to create value is split the companies and hope that you can create a Kellanova 2.0 where both entities get acquired at some point down the line, and that's where value creation happens,\" said Peter Galbo, analyst at Bank of America Securities.Kraft Heinz hired Steve Cahillane, the former CEO of Kellogg and then Kellanova, as its chief executive. Once the company separates, Cahillane will serve as chief executive of Global Taste Elevation, the placeholder name for the spinoff with high-growth brands like Heinz and Philadelphia.Steve Cahillane, President and CEO, Kellogg Company accepts Salute To Greatness Corporate Award during 2020 Salute to Greatness Awards Gala at Hyatt Regency Atlanta on January 18, 2020 in Atlanta, Georgia.Paras Griffin | Getty Images Entertainment | Getty ImagesBut acquiring either company resulting from the Kraft Heinz split would be a pretty big acquisition, making it less likely that either is snapped up, according to Galbo. And the resulting uncertainty about the value creation from the breakup is maybe why Berkshire Hathaway, the company's largest shareholder, is preparing to exit its 27.5% stake in Kraft Heinz.Food divestitures pick upA month into the new year, it's unlikely that the divestiture trend will slow down. On Tuesday, General Mills announced that it is selling its Muir Glen brand of organic tomatoes to focus on its core brands. And last week, Bloomberg reported that Nestle is preparing the sale of its water unit; the Swiss giant is also reportedly considering offloading upscale coffee brand Blue Bottle and its underperforming vitamin brands.And if Big Food is making any acquisitions, the deals are more likely to involve \"insurgent brands,\" according to Bain. Over the last five years, acquisitions with a value of less than $2 billion represented 38% of total consumer products deals, up from 16% in the period from 2014 to 2019, the firm said. For example, last year, PepsiCo bought prebiotic soda brand Poppi for $1.95 billion and Hershey snapped up LesserEvil popcorn for $750 million. Bigger deals are harder to come by because of the current regulatory environment, Konanahalli said. Buyers might not be strategic players, but instead private equity firms with plenty of cash on hand. For example, in January, L Catterton bought a majority stake in cottage cheese upstart Good Culture.But a flashy divestiture or acquisition might not be the solution to a food conglomerate's woes — or a surefire way to lift the stock price. Sometimes, good old-fashioned elbow grease can work even better.\"Just because it seems like the wind is blowing your way, it doesn't mean that you can't put in some hard work and turn things around,\" AlixPartners' Konanahalli said.",

The crackdown on immigration enforcement by federal agents in Minnesota \"has had, and will likely continue to have, profound and even heartbreaking consequences,\" U.S. District Judge Katherine Menendez said in the ruling.Menendez did not issue a decision on whether the activity itself was lawful. Rather, she said that the plaintiffs failed to meet the standard required for an emergency order to stop activity immediately, according to the ruling.The decision comes amid widespread protests and backlash against federal immigration enforcement activity in the state, especially after fatal shootings by immigration agents in Minneapolis resulting in the deaths of U.S. citizens Renée Good and Alex Pretti.Attorney General Pam Bondi called the ruling \"HUGE.\" \"Neither sanctuary policies nor meritless litigation will stop the Trump Administration from enforcing federal law in Minnesota,\" she said in a post on X.",

    "body": "A United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocket is on the launch pad carrying Amazon's Project Kuiper internet network satellites, which are expected to eventually rival Elon Musk's Starlink system, at the Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Cape Canaveral, Florida, on April 9, 2025.Steve Nesius | ReutersAmazon has asked the Federal Communications Commission for more time to meet a deadline that requires the company to deploy roughly 1,600 internet satellites by July 2026. The company needs to bring more of its satellites online so it can begin offering an internet-from-space service that was recently rebranded as Amazon Leo. The company has earmarked at least $10 billion to build the network.Delays beyond Amazon's control, including a \"shortage in the near-term availability\" of rockets, necessitate an extension, the company said in a filing made public on Friday. Amazon also pointed to manufacturing disruptions, the failure and grounding of new launch vehicles and limitations on spaceport capacity. Leo is \"producing satellites considerably faster than others can launch them,\" the company wrote. The company is now seeking a 24-month extension, to July 2028, or for the FCC to waive its deadline requiring Amazon to get roughly half of its 3,236 low Earth satellites up. In 2019, Amazon unveiled its plans to build a constellation of low Earth satellites. They are designed to provide high-speed, low-latency internet to consumers, corporations and governments, offering connections through square-shaped terminals. Amazon has booked more than 100 launches to deploy dozens of satellites at a time. The company said in the filing that it has bought 10 more launches with Elon Musk's SpaceX, as well as a dozen additional rides with Blue Origin, the space exploration startup of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos.The company said that many of its partners have notched significant launch milestones with their respective rockets in the past year. \"Not withstanding this progress, the development timelines for these next-generation vehicles have extended beyond initial projections, contributing to Amazon Leo's deployment delays,\" the company wrote.Amazon has sent up more than 150 satellites since April. The company said it expects to deploy about 700 satellites by July 30, \"moving from the third- to the second-largest satellite constellation in orbit.\" Its next launch is slated for Feb. 12, when Amazon will fling another 32 satellite into space atop a rocket from Arianespace, a French company. Leo's primary rival is SpaceX's Starlink, which has more than 9,000 satellites in orbit and roughly 9 million customers. Another challenger, OneWeb, is operated by France's Eutelsat and has a constellation of more than 600 satellites.In November, Amazon opened up an \"enterprise preview\" of Leo to select users ahead of a broader commercial launch. Amazon said if the FCC were to deny it an extension, it would \"undermine\" the agency's goals of expanding spectrum access and promoting \"expeditious deployment.\" The company also noted that the agency has previously granted similar extensions.\"Amazon Leo is engaged in full-scale deployment and stands on the doorstep of offering U.S. customers a competitive and innovative new service,\" the company said. \"An extension would enable this rapid and ongoing deployment to continue, while strict enforcement would interrupt or halt this effort.\" WATCH: Amazon laying off about 16,000 corporate workers in latest anti-bureaucracy pushwatch now",

    "body": "Miami, Florida, Aventura Mall, GameStop store entrance front view, video game retailer shop. Jeff Greenberg | Universal Images Group | Getty ImagesGameStop wants to acquire a publicly traded consumer company that's far larger than the video game retailer in a deal that could be \"transformational\" for the company, CEO Ryan Cohen told CNBC in an interview Friday.\"It's gonna be really big. Really big. Very, very, very big,\" Cohen said of the size of the acquisition. \"It's transformational. Not just for GameStop, but ultimately, within the capital markets … this is something that really has never been done before within the history of the capital markets.\"Cohen declined to name the company's targets – saying only he's seeking a publicly traded consumer company that's undervalued, \"high quality, durable, scalable with growth prospects\" and has a \"sleepy management team\" behind the wheel. He claimed if the investment pans out, it has the \"potential to make [GameStop] worth several hundreds of billions of dollars.\" \"If it works, it's genius. If it doesn't work, then, you know, it will be totally, totally foolish,\" Cohen, the co-founder and former CEO of Chewy, acknowledged. \"But I believe we have the components to make it work, and I'm very confident in the ability to make the asset much, much, much more efficient … we've got the governance structure, we've got the capital, we have the operational expertise.\"While Cohen has transformed GameStop from a dying legacy retailer into a money making business, it's unclear how an acquisition in the consumer space could increase its worth to over $100 billion – a herculean task for a business with a $10.5 billion market cap.One investment banker in the consumer and retail space was skeptical Cohen could pull it off, saying there are very few businesses in the sector that could increase GameStop's value so dramatically.\"I've never seen it,\" the person said. \"Unless you're talking about radically transforming a business model or something, it just doesn't happen in retail.\"Another agreed. \"It's easy to say something,\" the person said. \"It's a lot harder to do it.\"GameStop's ambitions to balloon in size first came to light in early January. The company unveiled a new, all-or-nothing equity incentive for Cohen that will only pay out if it reaches a market cap of $100 billion and sees $10 billion in cumulative earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. If GameStop's acquisition plans succeed and its market value hits $100 billion or more, Cohen gets his payday — but he said he hopes \"all shareholders do\" as well.Since taking over as GameStop's CEO in September 2023, Cohen has dramatically cut costs, improved the retailer's profitability and grown its collectibles business, even as overall sales have sagged.Between GameStop's fiscal 2023 third quarter, when Cohen took over, and its fiscal 2025 third quarter, its most recent quarter, GameStop's gross margin has grown by 7 percentage points and net income has climbed to $77.1 million, up from a loss of $3.1 million. In fiscal 2024 and 2025, the retailer posted consecutive annual net incomes following five straight years of losses.The company's success has attracted interest from Michael Burry — the investor who became famous after betting against the U.S. housing market ahead of the financial crisis — who recently disclosed that he's been buying shares. \"Ryan is making lemonade out of lemons,\" Burry said in a Monday Substack post. \"He has a crappy business, and he is milking it best he can while taking advantage of the meme stock phenomenon to raise cash and wait for an opportunity to make a big buy of a real growing cash cow business.\"Over the last two years, GameStop has also amassed a more than $9 billion cash pile between cash on hand and marketable securities – money the company had been using to invest in bitcoin. When asked if GameStop will liquidate its bitcoin holdings to help fund its acquisition plans, Cohen said he was \"not prepared to say,\" but called his new strategy \"way more compelling than bitcoin.\"\"It's similar to Berkshire Hathaway, except what Berkshire did in decades we're attempting to do in a much shorter time in terms of creating that much value,\" said Cohen. \"We can go in there and apply the Chewy and [GameStop] mindset of like brutal efficiency and increase the profitability of the company very, very quickly and so we could capture a lot more value by focusing on this under optimized asset, and then eventually we could move on to the next one, but, you know, we'll see what happens.\"",

    "body": "Thomas Fuller | Sopa Images | Lightrocket | Getty ImagesCompany: CoStar Group Inc (CSGP)Business: CoStar Group engages in the provision of online real estate marketplaces, information, and analytics in the commercial and residential property markets. It operates through the following segments: CoStar Portfolio, Information Services Portfolio, Multifamily Portfolio, LoopNet Portfolio and Other Marketplaces Portfolio. The CoStar Portfolio segment consists of two classes of trade receivables based on geographical location: North America and International. The Information Services Portfolio segment includes four classes of trade receivables: CoStar Real Estate Manager; Hospitality, North America; Hospitality, International; and other Information Services. The Multifamily Portfolio, LoopNet Portfolio and Other Marketplaces Portfolio segments focus on one class of trade receivables. The company was founded by Andrew Florance and Michael Klein in 1987 and is headquartered in Arlington, Va.Stock Market Value: $26.07B ($61.50 per share) Ownership: 0.71%Average Cost: n/aActivist Commentary: Third Point is a multi-strategy hedge fund founded by Dan Loeb, that will selectively take activist positions. Loeb is one of the true pioneers in the field of shareholder activism and one of a handful of activists who shaped what has become modern-day shareholder activism. He invented the poison pen letter in a time when it was often necessary. As times have changed, he has transitioned from the poison pen to the power of the argument. Third Point has amicably gotten board representation at companies like Baxter and Disney, but the firm will not hesitate to launch a proxy fight if it is being ignored.What's happeningOn Jan. 27, Third Point sent a letter to the CoStar board calling on them to (i) replace a majority of the board and align management compensation to total shareholder return; (ii) consider strategic alternatives for Homes.com and related residential real estate (RRE) businesses; and (iii) refocus on the core commercial real estate (CRE) business. Third Point was previously bound by standstill restrictions following a settlement for board seats last year, which expired on Jan. 27. The firm now plans to nominate a new slate of directors.Behind the scenesCoStar Group (CSGP) is a provider of online real estate marketplaces, information, and analytics in the property market. It manages major brands including CoStar Suite, LoopNet, Apartments.com and Homes.com. Approximately 95% of the company's revenue is derived from its core commercial real estate (\"CRE\") franchises, which largely consists of CoStar Suite and Apartments.com. These businesses benefit from high barriers to entry, strong pricing power, proprietary data and subscription-based business models that drive recurring revenue and highly predictable free cash flow. Because of these dynamics, this business has historically traded at a premium to its Information Services peers but is now trading in line with them.This regression in the company's valuation largely stems from CoStar's aggressive investment into the residential real estate (\"RRE\") marketplace, Homes.com, which the company acquired in May 2021. From the beginning, CoStar's plan to build a dominant online classifieds business in the U.S. RRE industry was deeply flawed. Unlike its core CoStar Suite and Apartment.com businesses, Homes.com lacks clear competitive advantages and meaningful differentiation and faces intense competition from well-established peers like Zillow. Nevertheless, over the past five years, CoStar has invested roughly $5 billion in its RRE segment, $3 billion of which was in the U.S. Despite this massive investment, the U.S. RRE businesses generated only $60 million of revenue in 2024 and $80 million in 2025. Moreover, in addition to these direct financial losses, these initiatives have diverted focus from the core CRE business, limiting its growth potential.It was this backdrop that initially prompted Third Point to engage with CoStar last year, which ultimately resulted in a support agreement between the company, D.E. Shaw and Third Point. This agreement included (i) the addition of Christine McCarthy, John Berisford and Rachel Glaser as directors to the board; (ii) the retirement of Michael Klein, Christopher Nassetta and Laura Kaplan from the board; (iii) the appointment of Louise Sams as independent board chair; and (iv) the creation of a capital allocation committee. While these governance changes appeared to be a meaningful step in the right direction, progress has been deeply disappointing. Management has continued to move forward with its U.S. RRE initiatives, repeatedly shifting the strategy and missing targets even after they had been revised. In fact, the RRE business has gotten so bad that in 2025, the company cut Homes.com subscription pricing by over 30% and Homes.com is now expected to reduce 2025 adjusted EBITDA by more than 65%. Moreover, these losses are not going away anytime soon, as CoStar's new medium-term guidance now projects that Homes.com will not break even until 2030. Unsurprisingly, these failures continue to be reflected in the company's share performance, which has been underperforming the S&P 500 by over 45 percentage points since the date of the agreement and over 120 percentage points over the past five years.With the standstill period now expired, it's perhaps no surprise that Third Point is escalating its engagement, issuing a letter to the CoStar board calling on them to (i) replace a majority of the board and align management compensation to total shareholder return; (ii) consider strategic alternatives for Homes.com and related RRE businesses; and (iii) refocus on the core CRE business. While the latter two of these initiatives may feel intuitive given the aforementioned track record, it prompts the troubling question as to why this has not already been put into motion. The answer to that is the board's failure to hold management accountable. In fact, the company has rewarded CEO Andrew Florance. In 2024, he received approximately $37 million in total compensation, placing him in the top 10% of S&P 500 CEO earners despite the company being in the bottom 10% of performers. The board has done nothing to remedy this going forward as it has proposed tying only 25% of his future long-term incentives to total shareholder return, further disconnecting his pay from shareholder outcomes and particularly concerning for a CEO with de minimis stock ownership. This was done by the new board with three of eight directors recently appointed through the Third Point/D.E. Shaw settlement agreement, which appears to underscore the degree of control the CEO maintains over the company.While this may seem like a tall task, if Third Point succeeds, the upside potential appears significant. The firm points out that CoStar Suite alone has significant untapped pricing power, with an average selling price of just $350 per month, far below comparable information services products. Third Point also believes that the company has substantial opportunities to expand into adjacent end markets and develop new agentic products. Overall, Third Point believes that the CRE business should be capable of achieving EBITDA margins above 50% in the medium term, with further expansion over time given that peers ultimately achieve margins from 60% to 70%. In addition, the company's under-levered balance sheet also provides capacity for meaningful share repurchases, creating further opportunities for shareholder value creation. Putting it all together, absent the RRE distraction, Third Point believes that the CRE business could compound revenue at a mid-teens rate and grow earnings power per share in excess of 20% annually.This engagement is an example of shareholder activism the way it ought to be. Third Point quickly and amicably agreed to a settlement with the company to give it a chance to show Third Point that it can change its ways and start to turn around its poor performance. Had CoStar Group done that, you would not be reading this right now. But the company did the opposite, leaning into the strategy that has been failing it and its shareholders. So, now Third Point knows two things for sure: (i) change is definitely needed and (ii) three new directors is not enough to release the grip that Florance has on the board. We would expect to see Third Point nominate anywhere from three to six new directors. Two of the three directors (Christine McCarthy and John Berisford) appointed in last year's settlement were selected by Third Point, and we would expect them to not be targeted this year. So, assuming they are on the ballot as incumbents, Third Point could get a majority of the board by winning three seats. The decision whether to go for more than three will be made after consulting advisors on strategy and doing proxy math, particularly in the era of the universal ballot. There is an outside chance that the firm goes for eight if the company does not nominate McCarthy and Berisford. We would hope to see a Third Point executive nominated because in situations like this where substantial change is needed and that change has been met with resistance by a founder/CEO for so many years, it is helpful to have the activist in the room who designed the plan and is most passionate about it. While Third Point does not overtly call for it, it is hard to imagine a scenario where the firm wins meaningful board representation and Florance stays on as CEO – it does not seem like either of them would want that.Third Point, founded by Dan Loeb, is a true pioneer in shareholder activism, but has used it more sparingly in recent years as dictated by the market environment and available opportunities. He invented the poison pen letter in a time when it was often necessary. As times have changed, he has transitioned from the poison pen to the power of the argument. However, in this campaign we see shades of the old Dan Loeb – using phrases like \"feckless board of directors\" and \"CEO and his supine enablers.\" We particularly enjoyed his analogy of a CEO's compensation to elementary school children who win participation awards for finishing last. CoStar Group saw the new, more amicable Dan Loeb in April when he settled for three new directors. Now, the company may have woken up the Dan Loeb of the past, who has been in a sort of hibernation for years. We will not know for sure until March 13 when the nomination window opens.Ken Squire is the founder and president of 13D Monitor, an institutional research service on shareholder activism, and the founder and portfolio manager of the 13D Activist Fund, a mutual fund that invests in a portfolio of activist investments.",

    "body": "You need to have the right skills to do the job you're hoping to land. But your ability to communicate that you have them — and can use them to help your prospective employer become more successful — is just as important.\"The things that make us good at communication also make us very, very attractive in an interview,\" Charles Duhigg tells CNBC Make It. Duhigg has studied hundreds of people in authoring three books on productivity, habits and communication. His latest book, \"Supercommunicators: How to Unlock the Secret Language of Connection,\" examines what sets the most effective communicators apart.Duhigg shared three communication tips that candidates should take into their next job interviews to connect with the person on the other side of the table (or screen) and make a stronger impression.1. Give authentic answersInterviewers know candidates are eager to impress. But if your answers to interview questions sound too polished or canned, you could be doing yourself a disservice.\"They know that you're performing; they know that you're there to try and get a job,\" Duhigg says. But the more we can \"genuinely convey who we are,\" the more the employer has \"a chance to see whether we'll actually succeed there.\"Answering questions genuinely, but tactfully, can help you stand out, he adds. \"The interviewer is going to remember that answer,\" he says. \"The best communication is the most genuine communication.\"One of the toughest questions to answer in an interview is \"Tell me about your weaknesses.\"If they ask a question like this, Duhigg says, \"and I answer it as honestly as I can, it doesn't mean that I have to expose my flaws, it doesn't mean that I have to say something out of line.\"Career coach Madeline Mann previously told CNBC Make It that an ideal answer would briefly explain a genuine weakness, but not one that's \"core to the job,\" before laying out steps you're taking to address the problem area.2. Ask questions\"Think about how many people go into an interview and the person asks them, 'Do you have any questions for me?' and the question they ask is completely predictable,\" Duhigg says.The best communicators typically \"ask a lot more questions\" than their peers, Duhigg says. They also ask what he calls deep questions, or those that center on a person's values, beliefs or experience.For job candidates, that might mean asking an interviewer how they got into that line of work, or what their favorite part of working there is.3. Mirror their body languageSome of the most important communication is silent. Body language can be very telling, and mirroring things like your interviewer's posture, gestures and expressions can make you a more attractive candidate for the job.That could be as simple as smiling back when they smile during conversation or noticing when they lean in and doing the same.\"The more we are prepared and comfortable doing that, the better off that interview is going to go,\" Duhigg says.Want to get ahead at work with AI?

    "body": "watch nowThe gap between the best and worse off Americans is growing — and economists don't see an end in sight.The \"K-shaped\" economy has been top of mind for consumers, corporate leaders, policymakers and investors since the Covid pandemic drastically reshaped Americans' financial habits almost six years ago. Economists now warn that this two-speed economic structure is a core feature — rather than a passing fad — within the world's largest economy.\"This is not a cyclical or temporary phenomena,\" said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics. \"This is a structural, fundamental issue.\"The prevailing theory goes something like this: Higher-earning consumers, encouraged by rallying stock holdings and elevated property values, are splashing out on vacations and premium goods. On the other hand, after years of higher-than-ideal inflation rates, lower-income cohorts are struggling to afford necessities such as housing, groceries and gasoline.A luxury airline seat and a value meal.Mensent Photography | Moment | Mario Tama | Getty ImagesTaken together, recent data suggests that bifurcation is as exacerbated as ever.The widening gapA key measure of wealth concentration called the Gini coefficient sits at 60-year highs, according to a report from U.S. Bank published earlier this month. That signaled a reversal of the drop to multidecade lows seen amid the rollout of pandemic-era economic stimulus, said Beth Ann Bovino, the bank's chief economist.The net worth of America's top 1% hit a record share of nearly 32% in the third quarter of 2025, the Federal Reserve reported. By comparison, the bottom 50% cumulatively held 2.5% of overall net wealth.The portion of U.S. GDP heading to workers in the form of compensation tumbled to its lowest level in its more than 75-year history, per data tracked by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. That means the average nonfarm business worker is seeing an increasingly small slice of an economy that has largely boomed over the last 15 years. This disparity has implications for how — and if — consumers spend their money.For instance, this divergence can explain why airlines are racing to build out luxury offerings at the same time that fast-food companies are leaning on value meals. Households with incomes under $75,000 are allocating less on discretionary categories like travel and experiences than in 2019, while those above $150,000 are allotting more, according to a Bank of America report released last month.Total relative \"outlays\" — a broad measure of spending and nonmortgage payments — by U.S. consumers in the top 20% hit multidecade highs last year, a data analysis conducted by Moody's found. The other 80% tumbled to new lows, the data shows.For that 80%, overall spending hasn't outpaced inflation over the last six years, said Moody's Zandi. That means neither economic quality of life nor spending power has improved for the lion's share of U.S. taxpayers in this timeframe, he said.\"Their standard of living has not budged since the pandemic hit,\" Zandi said. \"It's just disconcerting.\"A 'winner-take-all economy'While the \"K-shape\" term became popularized as an explanation for the uneven economic recovery seen during the pandemic, economists say the origins of this breakaway can be traced back decades earlier.This type of diverging economy stems from the economic reorganization seen during the Reagan administration, according to Joe Brusuelas, chief economist at tax firm RSM. About two decades later, the structural break that created the K-shaped economy, as it's now understood, was more clearly observed in the wake of the Global Financial Crisis of the late 2000s, he said.watch nowThat was in part due to the loss of wealth tied to the historic housing market crash, Brusuelas said. On top of that, he said the jump in joblessness limited earnings potential for those without steady employment in their prime working years.The Great Recession \"created the conditions for the winner-take-all economy that emerged in its aftermath,\" said Brusuelas, who first heard the K-shape term around 2008. \"If you live, work and inhabit certain portions of the economy, you might as well live on the dark side of the moon compared to what goes on down-market.\"Zandi pointed to the decline of unionization rates in the late 1900s as another driver of this divergence, given that it led to less negotiating power for workers.When the pandemic took hold in 2020, the stock market tanked and unemployment spiked as corporate America wondered what was coming next. But the benchmark S&P 500 has climbed over 130% since the Covid crisis' onset in March 2020, further boosting the wealth of higher-earning Americans who data shows are more likely to own stocks.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconThe S&P 500 since March 2020Lower-earners were seen as beneficiaries of pandemic stimulus programs and the subsequent worker shortage that led to outsized wage gains. However, Bank of America found higher-income Americans began seeing stronger wage growth last year. Spending also rose at a faster clip for top earners during much of 2025, data shows.Now, the poorest Americans feel increasingly cast out. The confidence gap between how the highest- and lowest-earners feel about their financial situation compared with five years prior grew to its widest in more than a decade in 2025, according to the University of Michigan's Surveys of Consumers. Michigan's overall sentiment index regained ground in January after tumbling near all-time lows in recent months.This can help explain the success of politicians who center campaigns on affordability. It's been a winning strategy for everyone from President Donald Trump, a Republican, to New York City Mayor Zohran Mamdani, a self-described democratic socialist.New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani (L) and US Senator Bernie Sanders join striking Starbucks workers in New York on Dec. 1, 2025. Angela Weiss | AFP | Getty ImagesThe path forwardLooking ahead, economists expect this inequality to only intensify.Several pointed to Trump's \"One Big Beautiful Bill\" — which shrinks programs like Medicaid and food stamps aimed at the poorest citizens — as a driver of further divergence. To make meaningful inroads, the U.S. would instead need to focus on tax reform and expanding social safety nets, according to RSM's Brusuelas.Current White House affordability efforts have had \"limited impact,\" said Dubravko Lakos-Bujas, JPMorgan's head of global markets strategy. But they could ramp up ahead of the November midterm elections, Lakos-Bujas said.Trump has pushed for temporary caps on credit card interest rates and a ban on institutional investors buying homes this year. He claimed last week that the U.S. has \"virtually no inflation,\" though recent data shows price growth remains above the 2% annual rate deemed healthy by the Fed.Beyond politics, economists worry that artificial intelligence will encourage businesses to further slash workforces in an already shaky labor market. Layoffs surged more than 50% in 2025 compared with a year prior, consulting firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas reported. Amazon, Home Depot and UPS announced job cuts this week.Some have warned against planning on long-term economic growth through the K-shape. Barry Bannister, Stifel's chief equity strategist, called it \"economically unsustainable\" in a note to clients this month. The viability of having better-off consumers accounting for an outsized share of spending makes for \"a good question,\" Fed Chair Jerome Powell said in December.Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell speaks at a press conference following the Federal Open Markets Committee meeting at the Federal Reserve on Dec. 10, 2025 in Washington, DC. Chip Somodevilla | Getty ImagesUltimately, the K-shape illustrates how the U.S. economy is reliant on small pockets of strength in several key areas, Zandi said. Because of that, he said economic growth can feel fragile or fleeting. Health care is the only sector consistently adding jobs in the labor market, Zandi noted. Megacap technology's leadership has propelled the stock market higher over recent years, the economist pointed out. Consumer spending, he said, is driven mostly by the highest earners.\"It doesn't feel like the economy's perched on a strong foundation,\" Zandi said. \"It's perched on a few poles that are sticking up. If one of those poles gets knocked out, then the whole economy gets knocked down.\"",

Schaben | Los Angeles Times | Getty ImagesTravelers, be warned: Starting Feb. 1, you may need to pay a fee of $45 or more for going through airport security checkpoints without a Real ID or another acceptable travel document. \"That's not nothing,\" John Breyault, vice president of public policy, telecommunications and fraud at the National Consumers League, a consumer advocacy group, said of the fee. \"If you ever needed a reason to get a Real ID-compliant ID, now's the time.\"The Real ID card is an upgraded driver's license or state identification card that officials say carries more stringent security and helps prevent fraudulent identification. It is state-issued and marked with a star. The federal government began requiring travelers to have a Real ID — or another document like a U.S. passport or passport card — to board a domestic flight, or enter certain federal facilities or nuclear power plants as of May 7, 2025. However, Feb. 1 marks the first time the Transportation Security Administration will impose a fee to enforce the rule.

Roughly 6% of travelers don't have a REAL ID or other acceptable form of identification, the TSA said in December when it announced the fee. \"This is really an enforcement mechanism,\" said Sally French, a travel expert at NerdWallet. \"It's a real penalty for travelers who arrive unprepared.\"More fees for longer trips Tanaonte | Istock | Getty ImagesVerification in the ConfirmID system is valid for a 10-day travel period, according to the TSA. Passing through a TSA checkpoint outside that 10-day period would require paying the TSA ConfirmID fee again, an agency spokesperson said in an email. In that scenario, a traveler on a longer trip could pay $90 total. \"If you go to Honolulu for two weeks, you may have to pay on the way back, too,\" Breyault said. \"If it wasn't bad enough to be nickel-and-dimed by the airlines, now you're getting nickel-and-dimed by the TSA.\"Travelers may face delays, missed flightsTravelers without an acceptable ID can complete the ConfirmID process before arriving at the airport. They can visit tsa.gov/ConfirmID, and then show their pay.gov receipt — a printout or screenshot — and any government-issued ID to the airport TSA officer, the agency said.watch nowTravelers can also pay the fee on-site. But TSA recommends that travelers pay the fee online before travel. Failure to do so may result in delays and missed flights, the TSA said. \"It is important that airline travelers plan ahead to ensure they have an acceptable form of ID to avoid these additional delays, as the process can take up to 30 minutes,\" according to the TSA. Low-income travelers, families face largest burdenA Real ID sign at John F. Kennedy Airport in New York, May 7, 2025.Kylie Cooper | ReutersCongress passed the Real ID Act in 2005. The law set minimum security standards for state-issued driver's licenses and ID cards in the wake of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. Breyault said he understands why the government would choose to impose a fee: It's a good way to motivate people to comply with the Real ID requirement, he said.However, the burden will fall hardest on low- to moderate-income travelers and families with older children, he said. A family of four, for example, might pay more than $200 to fly, assuming the children are at least 18 years old and the trip is longer, Breyault said. TSA doesn't require children under 18 to provide identification when traveling within the U.S., even if they are traveling alone, the agency said. Each airline sets its own ID requirements, according to the Federal Aviation Administration.Breyault's advice to consumers: \"Well in advance of your trip, make sure to get a Real ID-compliant ID from your [department of motor vehicles], and if you don't have it, make sure you have one of the other acceptable forms of ID.\"Real ID costs vary by state. In New Jersey, it costs $35 to get a Real ID, for example.  TSA estimates travelers will use the ConfirmID program about 10.6 million times over the next five years. The $45 fee will generate about $476 million in revenue, meant to offset administrative costs during that time, the agency said in a report issued Dec. 2. Adam Stahl, a senior official performing the duties of deputy TSA administrator, said in recent press release that the fee would ensure \"non-compliant travelers, not taxpayers, cover the cost of processing travelers without acceptable IDs.\"In a Nov. 13 report, the TSA initially estimated travelers would need to pay an $18 fee — less than half the final rate — to cover administrative expenses. Asked for comment on the fees, a TSA spokesperson didn't specify why the estimate changed in a matter of weeks. The TSA plans to reevaluate its fee structure every two years \"to account for evolving conditions and rates of compliance,\" the spokesperson said in an e-mail. ",

    "body": "watch nowIn his first stint at the Federal Reserve, Kevin Warsh came to a central bank that was about to be asked to save the world. He returns now under very different circumstances, asked to serve a notoriously fickle president who will place significant but very different demands on him.Warsh indeed is a Fed veteran, serving during the critical period of 2006 to 2011 that led up to and ultimately through the global financial crisis and the central bank's efforts to stabilize the economy. Appointed by President George W. Bush, Warsh was one of the youngest members ever to serve on the board of governors.While at the Fed, Warsh played an important role in the design and implementation of emergency lending programs aimed at stabilizing credit markets. Warsh also played a key role in helping devise the myriad programs aimed at rescuing the economy. One of those programs, developed separately at the Treasury Department, became known as the Troubled Asset Relief Program, developed by Neel Kashkari, who is now the Minneapolis Fed president.However, Warsh emerged from the era as a Fed critic. He warned that large-scale asset purchases and near-zero benchmark interest rates ran the risk of distorting markets and undermining long-term price stability. While supporting the earlier efforts, Warsh voted against the second round of Fed bond buying, a program known as quantitative easing.Read more CNBC news on Kevin WarshWho is Kevin Warsh?

Cross | Bloomberg | Getty Images'Central casting'Warsh has further criticized the post-financial crisis Fed with going too far in monetary policy stimulus, contending that it is helping sow the sees for further crises. In some respects, President Donald Trump is appointing a Fed chair who may be even less inclined to accommodate political pressure than Jerome Powell.Trump cited Warsh's extensive background in announcing his appointment to the top Fed post Friday morning. Warsh is currently a distinguished visiting fellow at Stanford University.\"On top of everything else, he is 'central casting,' and he will never let you down,\" the president posted on Truth Social.Warsh, is a Stanford University graduate who earned his law degree from Harvard and ultimately married into the Lauder cosmetics family. Before joining the Fed, he worked in investment banking at Morgan Stanley and served in the George W. Bush White House as a special assistant to the president for economic policy.While positioning himself as a defender of Fed independence, Warsh also has criticized it for mission creep and told CNBC in an interview last year that the central bank needs \"regime change.\"Warsh made his misgivings known about the current Fed. \"The credibility deficit lies with the incumbents that are at the Fed, in my view,\" he said during that July interview. It's a position that could put him in an adversarial role at an institution where consensus building is key to policy implementation.Despite multiple missteps on policymaking, Chair Powell has largely been able to keep the Fed consensus together. However, in recent months that has faltered, with each of the past several meetings featuring at least one and sometimes multiple dissents. Warsh's appointment would mark a sharp philosophical shift from Powell's pragmatic, consensus-driven approach and signal a potential tightening of the Fed's tolerance for inflation and balance sheet expansion. He would fill the seat currently occupied by Stephen Miran, whose term expires Saturday.Miran told CNBC on Friday that he supports the pick.\"Chairman-designate Warsh has a long history of being an innovative and original thinker on monetary policy,\" Miran said. \"He's got a number of really important insights over the years, and I'm really excited to see all the good work he's going to do at the Fed.\"watch nowCan Warsh sway the Fed committee?But if Trump thinks Warsh will be able to just push through aggressive rate cuts with ease, he might be in for an unpleasant surprise. Multiple voting members on the Federal Open Market Committee have expressed resistance to cutting further until there's more evidence that inflation is definitively moving towards the central bank's 2% inflation goal. Moreover, the full group of Fed officials in December indicated they see just one more rate cut coming in 2026, then another in 2027. In the aggregate, that's in line with market expectations, with futures traders pricing in two reductions this year and none next year.Traditionally, though, the chair has been first among equals when it comes to voting on the FOMC, so Warsh may be able to tilt the group in at least a bit more dovish direction.\"We see Warsh as a pragmatist not an ideological hawk in the tradition of the independent conservative central banker,\" Krishna Guha, head of global policy and central bank strategy at Evercore ISI, said in a note. \"Because he has a hawkish reputation and is seen as independent, he is better placed to bring the FOMC along with him to deliver at least two and plausibly three cuts this year than some rivals.\"So while Warsh may prove an ideological ally of the administration, how that translates into action will be a key question.\"Analytically, we expect he will be strongly aligned with the Administration's arguments that booming productivity will allow for neutral or accommodative rates even with robust growth,\" wrote Tobin Marcus, head of U.S. policy and politics at Wolfe Research. \"But it all depends how the data comes in, as we expect the rest of the FOMC will remain data-dependent and focused on the workhorse Fed models that Warsh has criticized.\"Warsh emerged from a competitive derby that one included 11 candidates, an array of past and present Fed officials, leading economists and a few Wall Street investment professionals including BlackRock fixed income chief Rick Rieder. That field was whittled down to five then four before Warsh emerged as the selection.Trump made no secret of the most important criteria — a willingness to slash rates lower and keep them low. The president has expressed the importance of lower rates as both a way to help the moribund U.S. housing market and to help lower financing costs for the $37 trillion U.S. debt. Before all that, he will have to be confirmed by a Senate during a ticklish political situation. The Trump Justice Department has been investigating the massive renovation project at the Fed's Washington, D.C., headquarters and has served Powell with a subpoena demanding information. Republican Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina has vowed to block any Trump Fed nominees until that situation is resolved.Once that hurdle is cleared, Warsh would face a full Senate in which Republicans still command a majority.\"The Warsh pick is likely to have broad support – Democrat economist Jason Furman is out early in favor – and he should be relatively easy to confirm in the Senate,\" Guha said.

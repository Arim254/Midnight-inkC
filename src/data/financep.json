    "body": "Even with a lower-than-expected inflation reading Thursday, the cost of everyday goods and services remains much higher than it was at the start of the decade.Prices rose 2.7% over the past year, according to the consumer price index, which tracks changes in the cost of everyday items such as groceries, shelter, clothing, health care and transportation. While that marks a sharper-than-expected slowdown from October's 3% pace and brings inflation closer to the Federal Reserve's 2% target, it has remained above the Fed's goal since March 2021.The cumulative effect of those increases continues to strain household budgets, says Scott Anderson, chief U.S. economist at BMO Harris Bank.\"We're all comparing our grocery bills to what our money could buy in 2019 and not walking away with a warm and fuzzy feeling,\" Anderson tells CNBC Make It.Overall prices are up about 25% since January 2020, based on CPI data — more than double the roughly 10% cumulative inflation seen in the five years before that.Feeling the pinchWages have largely kept up with inflation since 2020 by most federal measures of income, according to a July 2025 report from Brookings. Still, not every worker has seen those gains, says Anderson.\"Wage gains tend to be higher for higher-skilled workers than lower-skilled workers, and in industries like financial services, information services and manufacturing sectors,\" he says.That uneven pattern may help explain why confidence remains weak, even with relatively low unemployment and steady overall wage growth.Consumer sentiment — a closely watched measure of household confidence — is near historic lows, based on a monthly University of Michigan survey. The survey asks households how their finances compare with a year ago, whether they expect their finances to improve in the year ahead and whether now is a good time to make major purchases. The latest index reading fell to 51 in November, a level last seen during the inflation surge of 2022, when the year-over-year inflation rate reached a peak of 9.1%.Similarly, a recent Bankrate survey found that 32% of Americans expect their finances to worsen in 2026, the highest level of pessimism since the annual survey began in 2018. Inflation stood out as the top concern, cited by nearly two-thirds of respondents — far more often than income, debt or interest rates.\"The cost of living still feels like it's rising for households who are now paying a lot more for food, electricity and housing than they were for several years before inflation shot up,\" says Atsi Sheth, chief credit officer at Moody's Ratings.Want to give your kids the ultimate advantage?

    "body": "US President Donald Trump speaks during the unveiling of the Kennedy Center Honors nominees on August 13, 2025, at the Kennedy Center in Washington, DC.Mandel Ngan | Afp | Getty ImagesThe John F. Kennedy Memorial Center for the Performing Arts, commonly known as the Kennedy Center, will be renamed the \"Trump-Kennedy Center,\" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Thursday.The prestigious Washington, D.C., cultural center's board of trustees, who were appointed by President Donald Trump in February, \"have just voted unanimously\" on the name change, Leavitt said in an X post.They did so \"because of the unbelievable work President Trump has done over the last year in saving the building,\" Leavitt said.\"Congratulations to President Donald J. Trump, and likewise, congratulations to President Kennedy, because this will be a truly great team long into the future! The building will no doubt attain new levels of success and grandeur,\" she said.The move may face challenges, however: U.S. code states that no new \"memorials or plaques in the nature of memorials shall be designated or installed in the public areas of the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts.\"To change that would require Congress, NBC News reported in July. House Republicans have already introduced at least one bill to rename the center in Trump's honor.Leavitt's depiction of a center that has been saved \"not only from the standpoint of its reconstruction, but also financially, and its reputation\" contrasts with reporting from multiple news outlets that ticket sales and staffing both have sharply declined this year.The New York Times reported last month that internal figures showed ticket sales during a typical week in October down by about 50% from the same period a year earlier.The Washington Post, which analyzed sales data from early September through Oct. 19, found an \"across-the-board drop-off\" in ticket sales for the center's three largest performance spaces.Weeks after taking office, Trump named himself chairman of the Kennedy Center and terminated a slew of existing board members, saying they \"do not share our Vision for a Golden Age in Arts and Culture.\"He signaled in October that the name change was forthcoming.In a Truth Social post, Trump shared pictures of a newly painted colonnade on the outside of the building below a caption praising \"the new TRUMP KENNEDY, whoops, I mean, KENNEDY CENTER, columns.\"He nevertheless said later Thursday that he was \"surprised\" by the board's decision.\"I was honored by it. You know, we're saving the building,\" he told reporters in the Oval Office.The center was not initially named after Kennedy.It was created in 1958, when President Dwight Eisenhower signed legislation to \"provide for a National Cultural Center\" in Washington.In 1962, Eisenhower's successor, Kennedy, and first lady Jacqueline Kennedy led a $30 million fundraising campaign to build the center.Kennedy was assassinated in November 1963. Two months later, President Lyndon Johnson signed a law renaming the center in honor of the slain president.Trump has used the Kennedy Center extensively during the first year of his second presidential term.He attended a board meeting there in March, claiming the building was in \"tremendous disrepair.\" In June, he and first lady Melania Trump appeared for the opening night of the musical \"Les Miserables.\"This month, Trump took the unusual step of hosting the Kennedy Center Honors, where actors Sylvester Stallone and Michael Crawford, and musicians including Gloria Gaynor, George Strait and the members of '80s rock band KISS, were saluted.Trump also attended the FIFA World Cup drawing at the center, where he was awarded the soccer organization's newly created \"peace prize.\"",

David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesNike is expected to report earnings after the bell Thursday as Wall Street eyes the company's progress in reigniting its business. The sneaker company is just over a year into CEO Elliott Hill's turnaround strategy, focusing on regaining its growth and market share, clearing out old inventory and investing in wholesale relationships.Here's what analysts are expecting for Nike's second fiscal quarter of 2026, according to consensus estimates from LSEG:Earnings per share: 38 cents expectedRevenue: $12.22 billion expectedThe company is set to hold a conference call with investors at 5 p.m. ET as analysts look for a read on holiday demand. Nike's stock has dropped more than 11% this year. In Nike's fiscal first-quarter earnings report, Hill reported some positive developments in the company's turnaround, citing improvements in wholesale, running and North America. But Hill noted that other areas, like its China segment and direct business, have not been performing as well.Nike expects those headwinds to continue into the new year.Hill told CNBC in October that the company's turnaround plan is showing progress, but it will \"take a while\" to return to profitable growth. The sneaker giant has also been taking a hit from tariffs. In September, the company said it expected tariffs to cost it $1.5 billion and impact its gross margin by 1.2 percentage points in its current fiscal 2026. It's an increase from the $1 billion and 0.75 percentage point hit it expected earlier this year.The company previously said it expected its gross margin for its second quarter to fall between 3 and 3.75 percentage points.Nike also underwent leadership changes to \"remove layers,\" according to Hill, earlier this month. Under its \"Win Now\" strategy, the company announced that Chief Commercial Officer Craig Williams would leave the sneaker giant. Hill called the shake-up a move \"about growth and offense.\"\"Collectively, these changes amount to us eliminating layers and better positioning Nike to continue to have an impact the way only Nike can,\" Hill said in a statement at the time.The company also has reported a strong start in its NikeSKIMS partnership with Kim Kardashian's shapewear brand, which Hill previously said has seen a \"very strong\" response.

    "body": "Traders work on the floor at the New York Stock Exchange in New York City, U.S., Dec. 17, 2025.  Brendan McDermid | ReutersWall Street could be in for a volatile end to the week as traders brace for what Goldman Sachs says will be the largest options expiration on record.Options expiration days are a monthly occurrence on Wall Street when the contracts on short-term derivatives expire. Friday happens to be one of the rare times (four times a year) when options on four types of securities expire on the same day: index options, single stock options, index futures and index futures options. This is called a \"quadruple witching\" day.More than $7.1 trillion in notional options exposure is set to expire this Friday, according to Goldman, including roughly $5 trillion tied to the S&P 500 index and $880 billion linked to single stocks. December options expirations are typically the biggest of the year, but this one eclipses all prior records, the firm said.To put the scale into context, the options expiring Friday represent notional exposure equal to about 10.2% of the total market capitalization of the Russell 3000, Goldman said.That dynamic could lead to choppy trading, particularly around heavily watched levels in the S&P 500, according to Jeff Kilburg, founder and CEO of KKM Financial.\"I am expecting volumes to be well above normal as options traders finalize 2025 profits and losses,\" Kilburg said. \"But a lot of the repositioning seems to have already taken place. 6800 is a big strike price in the S&P and we will see if the bulls can defend that level after pushing the market back above it this morning.\"The S&P 500 is up about 15% this year, trading around 6,770 on Thursday. Stock Chart IconStock chart iconS&P 500 YTDWhile the broader market could have heightened volumes and volatility, some individual stocks with large open interest could see a different scenario. If options traders who hedge their positions are sitting on a large amount of at-the-money options, the activity tied to those contracts expiring can actually calm price swings rather than intensify them. Options that are \"at the money\" have strike prices that are equal to the current price of the underlying asset.As traders adjust their hedges, prices can get pulled toward heavily traded strike levels, a phenomenon known as a \"pin,\" leaving stocks hovering near key levels into the close, Goldman noted.\"This situation is often referred to as a 'pin' and can be an ideal situation for a large investor trying to enter/exit a stock position,\" Goldman said.Stocks with options expiring Friday that represent a large share of their typical daily trading volume — and could be prone to \"pinning\" — include GeneDx Holdings, BILL Holdings, Avis Budget Group and GameStop, the firm found.",

    "body": "There's no one right way to retire early. Some people manage to sell a business for a huge sum while others build passive income streams that allow them to leave their 9-to-5. Many adherents to the FIRE movement — short for financial independence, retire early — aim to save a large portion of their income in order to build a big enough investment portfolio to withdraw from in perpetuity. If you're hoping to follow that model, or even if you're aiming for a traditional retirement, new research indicates that you may be able to withdraw more from your portfolio each year — or build a smaller stash overall — than previously thought. For years, financial planners and early retirees alike have relied on the so-called \"4% rule\" as a guideline. The rule, which says it's generally safe to withdraw 4% of a balanced portfolio annually, adjusted for inflation, for a 30-year retirement was first described in a 1994 paper published in the Journal of Financial Planning by financial advisor Bill Bengen. Bengen's new book expands on his original research and, as a result, adjusts the safe withdrawal rate upward. For those still planning to take out 4% of their portfolio in retirement, \"I think they're cheating themselves a little bit,\" he tells CNBC Make It.Bengen's new default safe withdrawal rate for a 30-year retirement: 4.7%. And that number can go higher — even for early retirees — during periods of low to moderate inflation, he says.Arriving at the 4.7% ruleBengen arrived at his estimates through backward-looking data dating to 1926. Essentially, he says he wanted to find out what percentage of retirees' portfolios could be taken out each year, historically, with no one in his data set running out of money. Back in 1994, Bengen made a few assumptions. He assumed that historical investors had their savings in a tax-advantaged retirement account with 60% in U.S. large-company stocks and 40% in intermediate-term U.S. government bonds. He assumed the investor rebalanced to these allocations once per year. And he assumed that the investor would withdraw a certain percentage at the beginning of retirement and adjust the withdrawal for inflation, similar to the way Social Security does it, each following year. Putting those assumptions to work, he found that an initial withdrawal rate of 4.1%, adjusted for inflation thereafter, would see no historical investor run out of money over the course of a 30-year retirement. Thus, the 4% rule was born.Bengen made a few adjustments in his latest research to better reflect the asset mix that investors hold in retirement. He now assumes a portfolio with 55% in stocks, 45% in bonds and 5% in cash in the form of T-bills. Within that stock allocation, he includes large, midsize, small and micro-size company U.S. stocks, as well as some international exposure. The result: Under the historical worst-case scenario (one with high inflation and an unfavorable stock market) the investor can safely withdrawal 4.7% in retirement without running out of money for 30 years. For a 50-year retirement, it's closer to 4.2%. You may be able to safely withdraw even more, depending on conditions in the economy and stock market at the time you retire, Bengen finds. Your personal number may be higher, Bengen says, during periods when stocks aren't too richly valued and when inflation is at low to moderate levels. But you'll have to be vigilant — bear markets or periods of high inflation, especially at the outset of your retirement, could either force you to take more modest withdrawals or increase the risk that you'll run out of money, Bengen says. \"My research shows that if you endure a substantial bear market early in retirement, it drives down your withdrawal rates, because it sucks a lot out of the portfolio at the same time that you're drawing from it,\" Bengen says.The rate of inflation can also play a role in deciding how much to withdraw. Rapidly rising costs deplete the buying power of your savings, which, in turn, may force you to either withdraw more money or cut back on expenses — or both — in retirement, Bengen says. No two investors' withdrawal strategies will be exactly the same, and keeping tabs on these factors can be tricky, Bengen says. For those reasons, you'd be wise to discuss your retirement plans, early or otherwise, with a financial professional.And no matter what type of retirement you're planning for, it's smart to err on the conservative side with your planning, Bengen says. \"You don't know what the market or inflation could do. You don't know how long you'll live. [You] really don't know what your expenses will be like 30 years from now,\" he says.Want to give your kids the ultimate advantage? Sign up for CNBC's new online course, How to Raise Financially Smart Kids.

    "body": "watch nowThursday saw the release of a much lighter-than-expected consumer price report for November, breaking from the recent trend of sticky inflation.Stocks jumped. Yields fell. Odds of a Federal Reserve rate increased.And many economists scratched their heads.The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that the consumer price index had an annual inflation rate of 2.7% last month, while core CPI – a measure that excludes volatile food and energy prices – was even lower at 2.6%. Both were below than what economists had been estimating, as those polled by Dow Jones called for an annual headline rate of 3.1% and a rate on core CPI of 3%. The November data release Thursday was delayed by 8 days because of the U.S. government shutdown, but more importantly, the October data was canceled, leaving it to the BLS to make certain methodological assumptions about the prior months' inflation levels.Those assumptions in the methodology were not clear to economists and were not fully explained in the release.\"The downside surprise reflects weakness in both goods and services, but may be partly due to methodological issues. The BLS might have carried forward prices in some categories, effectively assuming 0% inflation,\" Michael Gapen, chief U.S. economist at Morgan Stanley, said in a note, deeming the November reading as \"noisy\" in a way that's \"difficult to draw strong conclusions.\" \"If these technical factors are the main source of weakness, we could see reacceleration in December,\" Gapen added.The main issue: 'OER'Economists were zooming in on one particularly important subset in the data as problematic: owners' equivalent rent. This is a key part of calculating the inflation seen in the housing market.UBS economist Alan Detmeister said the price changes in October for the OER appear to have been \"set to zero.\"Evercore ISI's Krishna Guha, digging deeper, said it appears the BLS \"put in zero inflation in multiple categories\" while calculating the OER for the approximately one-third of cities used.\"To the extent that it introduces a downward bias, the Fed would be mindful of the risk of taking the data on housing services inflation at face value,\" he wrote in a Thursday note.Detmeister said the impact of this could linger for the next few months.\"This weakness should be reversed with very large OER and tenants' rents increases in the April CPI released in May, but until then the price levels for OER and tenants' rent will be biased downward,\" he said.Stephanie Roth of Wolfe Research estimated that the 0.13% rise in rent and 0.27% increase in OER across the two-month period comes out to a respective climb of about 0.06% and 0.13% month over month.CNBC has reached out to the BLS for comment.There were other issues as well.Roth noted that there was likely downward pressure on certain goods categories since the BLS's data collection period took place later in November, a time when there's \"more holiday discounting.\"\"The market seems to be taking the data as a dovish signal, but given the technical quirks we expect the Fed will put less weight on this reading,\" she said in a note to clients. \"While its positive inflation doesn't appear to be rising strongly on the back of tariffs, there will likely be a bounce back as the data normalizes after the shutdown-related volatility.\"To be sure, there was already some skepticism toward the report in the leadup to its release, with some on Wall Street raising concerns around bias due to impacts from the shutdown, which ended in mid-November.The enthusiasm on Wall Street that followed the release eased as the trading day continued. Stocks were off their highs, with technology stocks doing most of the heavy lifting and shares more linked to the economy like banks in the red. Yields were off their lows as well.— With reporting by Steve Liesman",

    "body": "U.S. President Donald Trump sits in the Oval Office to sign executive orders, at the White House in Washington, D.C., U.S., Dec. 18, 2025. Evelyn Hockstein | ReutersPresident Donald Trump signed an executive order Thursday directing federal agencies to reclassify marijuana, loosening long-standing restrictions on the drug and marking the most consequential shift in U.S. cannabis policy in more than half a century.The order, once finalized by the Drug Enforcement Administration, moves cannabis out of Schedule I classification — the most restrictive category under the Controlled Substances Act, alongside heroin and LSD — to a Schedule III classification, which encompasses substances with accepted medical use and a lower potential for abuse, such as ketamine and Tylenol with codeine.\"This action has been requested by American patients suffering from extreme pain, incurable diseases, aggressive cancers, seizure disorders, neurological problems and more, including numerous veterans with service related injuries, and older Americans who live with chronic medical problems that severely degrade their quality of life,\" Trump said from the Oval Office Thursday.  Also on Thursday, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, led by Dr. Mehmet Oz, is expected to launch a pilot program in April enabling certain Medicare-covered seniors to receive free, doctor-recommended CBD products, which must comply with all local and state laws on quality and safety, according to senior White House officials. The products must also come from a legally compliant source and undergo third-party testing for CBD levels and contaminants.Shares of cannabis conglomerates were mixed following the announcement. Shares of Tilray Brands were up about 6% while shares of Trulieve sank roughly 15% and Green Thumb Industries fell around 5% in afternoon trading. The AdvisorShares Pure US Cannabis ETF, which tracks American operators, fell more than 10%.\"Millions of registered patients across the United States, many of them veterans, rely on cannabis for relief from chronic and debilitating symptoms. We commend the administration for taking this historic step. This is only the beginning,\" Ben Kovler, CEO and founder of Green Thumb, said in a statement to CNBC. The reclassification is viewed by many analysts as a financial lifeline for the cannabis industry. The move exempts companies from IRS Code Section 280E, allowing them to deduct standard expenses like rent and payroll for the first time. It also opens the door for banking access and institutional capital previously sidelined by compliance fears. Many on Wall Street also expect the changes and the Medicare pilot to draw major pharmaceutical players into the sector to chase federally insured revenue.While CBD has surged in popularity in recent years, with infused consumer goods ranging from seltzers to skincare, the FDA has stopped short of granting the compound its full backing. Studies have found \"inconsistent benefits\" for targeted conditions, while FDA-funded research warns that prolonged CBD use can cause liver toxicity and interfere with other life-saving medications. Currently, the FDA has only approved one CBD-based, Epidiolex, for rare forms of epilepsy.\"I want to emphasize that the order ... doesn't legalize marijuana in any way, shape or form, and in no way sanctions its use as a recreational drug,\" Trump said. Experts and industry insiders told CNBC this week that a reclassification could pave the way for more research into the effects of CBD use. ",

    "description": "President Donald Trump's social media company will provide the capital needed to bring TAE Technologies' first fusion power plant online in the United",
    "body": "President Donald Trump's social media company will provide the capital needed to bring TAE Technologies' first fusion power plant online in the United States by 2031, TAE CEO Michl Binderbauer told CNBC on Thursday.Binderbauer spoke shortly after his privately held company and Trump Media and Technology Group announced plans for an all-stock merger valued at more than $6 billion.The CEO said the deal would combine Trump Media's \"fortress balance sheet\" with TAE's technologies.\"We've got capability and technology to really scale this,\" Binderbauer told CNBC.\"We've got the engineering prowess to do that, but the last piece of the puzzle was the capital,\" he said. \"Now, you're marrying capital with that underlying base of technical capability.\"Fusion is a form of nuclear power that could one day generate enormous amounts of energy by fusing atoms. The process, which powers the Sun, does not produce the long-life radioactive waste that is the byproduct of fission, the process created in traditional nuclear reactors. Despite decades of research, scientists and companies have so far been unable to commercialize fusion technology. Fusion ignition was only achieved for the first time in a laboratory setting in December 2022. But Binderbauer said he is bullish on his company's prospects to reliably generate —  and sell — fusion power, now that it can tap funding from Trump Media.Trump Media, which operates the Truth Social app, will invest up to $200 million in TAE with another $100 million coming after filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Binderbauer said. Trump Media has meager revenue relative to its market capitalization, which was above $4 billion on Thursday, and to its balance sheet. For the third quarter that ended on Sept. 30, Trump Media had financial assets of $3.1 billion, which included cash and digital assets, the company announced last month. Trump Media for that quarter reported a net loss of $54.8 million, with sales of just under $973,000.TAE and Trump Media said that their merged company in 2026 plans, subject to regulatory approval, to \"site and begin construction on the world's first utility-scale fusion power plant,\" which would generate 50 megawatts of electrical power, an industry measurement. TAE has plans to scale up future fusion power plants to generate between 350 to 500 megwatts of power, Binderbauer said. A traditional fission nuclear power plant can generate about two to three times that power, depending on the reactor. \"Fusion power will be the most dramatic energy breakthrough since the onset of commercial nuclear energy in the 1950s,\" Trump Media CEO Devin Nunes said on a call Thursday. \"An innovation that will lower energy prices, boost supply, ensure America's AI supremacy and revive America's manufacturing base and bolster national defense,\" Nunes said.Trump Media's investment comes as the artificial intelligence boom has left utilities scrambling to find enough power to fuel the build-out of data centers across the country. In October, the Energy Department launched a national strategy in October to accelerate the commercialization of fusion. Nunes said, \"Together with TAE, we will have the capital and public market access to scale TAE's vision to put abundant nuclear energy on the grid.\"Nunes, who is a former House member from California, and Binderbauer plan to serve as co-CEOs of the merged company.\"Nunes will continue to lead all Trump Media brand operations. Binderbauer will manage TAE Technologies,\" a news release said.TAE, whose board members include Ernest Moniz, who served as Energy secretary in the Obama administration, was founded in 1998.Since then, the company has raised more than $1.3 billion in private capital in a dozen rounds of funding, from investors such as Chevron and Alphabet's Google. Asked why TAE did not strike a deal with one of its prior investors, Binderbauer said Trump Media moved quickly and boldly.\"We have these partnerships, but this is the one that moved,\" Binderbauer said.\"I just have to reduce it to that simple sort of factor. That's really the difference,\" he said. \"We're going to build a power plant. We're going to take this technology to the commercial level.\" TAE has not yet made siting decisions or reached offtake agreements for its planned plants, Binderbauer said. \"We're in the process on that,\" the CEO said.  \"We're going to announce that when we're ready with that, but we have a game plan.\" Michael Schwab will serve as chairman of the combined company's nine-member board. Trump's son, Donald Trump Jr., Nunes, and Binderbauer serve as directors. The five other members are yet to be chosen. ",

    "body": "Sanjay Mehrotra, CEO of Micron Technology Inc., speaks during an interview with CNBC on the floor at the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York City, U.S., April 26, 2024. Brendan Mcdermid | ReutersThe House of Representatives on Thursday passed a bill aimed at making it easier to get federal permits to build infrastructure for artificial intelligence projects.The bill, known as the SPEED Act, is backed Big Tech giants such as OpenAI, Micron and Microsoft The bipartisan bill cleared the House in a 221-196 vote, overcoming a conservative rebellion that nearly sank the legislation in a procedural vote earlier this week. The bill now heads to the Senate, where it is likely to be part of a larger conversation around permitting reform. The SPEED Act's proponents argue it is critical to help the U.S. outpace China and other global competitors in the race for AI dominance. \"The electricity we will need to power AI computing for civilian and military use is a national imperative,\" said Rep. Bruce Westerman, R-Ark., the bill's sponsor and chair of the House Natural Resources Committee. The SPEED Act would reform the 1969 National Environmental Policy Act, which mandates federal reviews for projects that would impact the environment.It would tighten the timelines for NEPA reviews and shrink the statute of limitations for NEPA litigation to 150 days from the current six years. Permitting reform has drawn bipartisan support recently as clean energy projects supported by Democrats became ensnared in permitting delays.Pressure has built on Congress to act as AI has emerged as a key sector and power-hungry data centers have placed an increased strain on the electric grid. Read more CNBC politics coverageTrump sues BBC for $10 billion, claims defamation from Panorama documentaryPentagon takes big stake in new Korea Zinc refinery in Tenn., gets 10% of companyNew Trump tariffs collection hits $200 billion, Customs saysFormer Instacart employee says she was fired over her Democratic congressional campaignUkraine peace talks progressing, Russia open to EU membership, U.S. officials sayNew York AG sues UPS for allegedly shorting Christmas season workers' wagesTrump admin to hire 1,000 specialists for 'Tech Force'Trump doubles down on Rob Reiner criticism after killing; director's son in custodyTSA is giving airline passenger data to ICE for deportation push: NYTTrump's AI order may be 'illegal,' Democrats and consumer advocacy groups claimTrump sued by preservation group seeking to halt White House ballroom projectTrump says 'no big deal' after new Epstein photos showing him releasedPutin can fund war for years, ex-official says as Trump's resolve is testedIndiana redistricting bill that Trump demanded defeated in state SenateHouse passes INVEST Act to ease investment standards, boost capital in marketsDOJ fails again to indict New York AG James, a Trump target: ReportsTrump 'sells out' U.S. national security with Nvidia chip sales to China: WarrenTrump pushes for top prosecutor nominee Halligan after Comey, James cases tossedTrump willing to seize more oil tankers off Venezuela coast: White HouseSeized tanker will go to U.S. port, Trump admin intends 'to seize the oil'GOP lawmakers seek Trump aid for agricultural equipment after tariff pressureTrump says Fed could have 'at least doubled' latest interest rate cut'Spoof' ship: Seized oil tanker hid location, visited Iran and VenezuelaTrump admin touts pulling 9,500 truckers off road for failing English testsSwiss government says new 15% U.S. tariff ceiling retroactive to mid-NovemberHomeland Security Dept. buying Boeing 737s for ICE deportationsTrump officials move to end student loan payment pause for millions of borrowersJudge unseals Ghislaine Maxwell grand jury materials, citing Epstein files actUkraine at 'critical moment' in war as European allies ramp up pressure on RussiaDemocrats establish AI working group as industry bolsters DC presenceEx-Trump lawyer Habba resigns as NJ U.S. attorney after disqualificationThe Democratic cosponsor of the bill, Rep. Jared Golden of Maine, said the SPEED Act would allow the U.S. to be \"nimble enough to build what we need, when we need it.\" Most Democrats opposed the SPEED Act, however, demanding that any permitting bill overturn President Donald Trump's moves to choke renewable energy sources like offshore wind. Democratic resistance was only compounded after GOP leadership inserted language to exempt Trump's efforts to block renewables from provisions in the SPEED Act that would limit the White House's ability to arbitrarily yank permits it does not like.The amendment was added after a standoff on the House floor during a procedural vote, where conservatives opposed to renewable energy demanded concessions for their votes.\"That provision codifies a broken permitting status quo,\" said Rep. Scott Peters, D-Calif., who supports permitting reform but opposed the SPEED Act.\"I look forward to working with my colleagues across the aisle in the Senate to craft a bipartisan product that can become law.\"",

    "body": "The Eli Lilly & Co. logo at the company's Digital Health Innovation Hub facility in Singapore, on Thursday, Nov. 14, 2024.Ore Huiying | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesEli Lilly on Thursday said its closely watched obesity pill helped patients maintain the majority of their weight loss after they switched directly from taking the company's injection Zepbound and Novo Nordisk's rival shot Wegovy in a late-stage trial. The company also said it has filed for Food and Drug Administration approval of the daily GLP-1 pill, called orforglipron, for obesity. The FDA in November said it awarded a priority review voucher to that pill, which could expedite its review timeline to a few months. Shares of Eli Lilly rose more than 2% on Thursday after the announcement. The positive trial data suggests that the pill could be an effective treatment for patients to transition to if they want to preserve their weight loss but don't want to take weekly injections long term. Many people who stop those shots regain much of the weight they initially shed. While Eli Lilly's pill appears to cause less weight loss overall than existing injections, Thursday's results highlight its potential role as a needle-free maintenance treatment in the blockbuster GLP-1 market. But an oral pill for obesity from Novo Nordisk will likely enter the market first, giving the Danish drugmaker a head start in staking its claim in the space.The phase three trial followed more than 300 patients with obesity who previously took Wegovy or  Zepbound for 72 weeks in a separate late-stage study. Those people were then randomized to take either Eli Lilly's pill or a placebo for another 52 weeks. The oral drug met the trial's main goal of demonstrating superior weight loss maintenance compared with a placebo, among people who previously experienced a plateau in their progress while taking the injections. On average, patients who switched to the pill from Novo Nordisk's Wegovy only regained roughly 2 pounds of the weight they initially lost by the end of the trial. Meanwhile, on average, people who switched to the pill from Zepbound only regained around 11 pounds of the weight they initially lost by the end of the study. That means people in the Wegovy group maintained about 95% of their weight loss after switching, while those in the Zepbound group maintained roughly 80%. \"Obesity is a chronic, progressive disease, and sustaining weight loss remains a significant challenge for many,\" said Kenneth Custer, president of Lilly Cardiometabolic Health, in a release. He said the trial showed that the pill \"helped people maintain the weight they worked hard to lose\" and that, if approved, it could \"provide a convenient alternative for the millions of individuals living with obesity around the globe to continue their long-term health journey.\"While people in the Zepbound group appeared to regain more weight, the bigger focus is likely on those who transitioned from the drug's top competitor, Wegovy. In an October note, BMO Capital Markets analyst Evan Seigerman said positive results from the trial could give Eli Lilly \"the unique opportunity to capture revenue share\" from chronic treatment with semaglutide, the active ingredient in Novo Nordisk's Wegovy and diabetes injection Ozempic. \"Chipping away at the potential for Novo's flagship product,\" Seigerman wrote. In a note on Thursday, Leerink Partners analyst David Risinger said the data \"will help drive commercial success and upside to consensus expectations\" for Eli Lilly's pill. He said the firm expects the drug to rake in $2 billion in sales by the end of 2026, $9 billion by the end of 2027 and $16 billion by the end of 2028. Dr. Caroline Apovian, co-director of the Center for Weight Management and Wellness at Brigham and Women's Hospital, said the results were \"still great\" even though patients regained some of the weight they lost. But she said, \"in order for this to be a good switch, these orals are going to have to be less expensive for the insurance companies to cover than the injectables, right?\" Obesity injections currently carry list prices of roughly $1,000 per month before insurance, though both Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk have cut the direct-to-consumer prices of their drugs for cash-paying patients. It's unclear how the companies will price their respective pills. But under recent deals with President Donald Trump, the companies said starting doses of their upcoming oral drugs, pending approvals, will be $149 per month for everyone getting them through the direct-to-consumer website TrumpRx. That site launches in January. The overall safety and tolerability – or how well patients handle treatment – of the pill were consistent with previous late-stage studies. The most common side effects were gastrointestinal related and generally mild to moderate in severity. More CNBC health coverageThe Trump administration is changing Covid, childhood vaccine recommendations – here's what it means for youU.S. to impose 100% tariff on branded, patented drugs unless firms build plants locally, Trump saysEli Lilly to build $6.5 billion Texas manufacturing facility for obesity pill, other drugsAround 4.8% of people who switched to the pill from Wegovy discontinued treatment due to side effects, while 7.2% of those who switched to the oral drug from Zepbound did the same. Meanwhile, those rates were 7.6% and 6.3% among patients who switched to a placebo from Wegovy and Zepbound, respectively. No liver safety issues were observed, according to Eli Lilly. Full results of the trial, called ATTAIN-MAINTAIN, will be presented at an upcoming medical meeting and published in a peer-reviewed journal next year. Eli Lilly's pill works in a similar way to Wegovy, Ozempic and Novo Nordisk's diabetes pill Rybelsus, targeting a gut hormone called GLP-1 to suppress a person's appetite and regulate blood sugar. Novo Nordisk is also seeking approval of an oral version of Wegovy for obesity, which could come by year-end.But unlike those three treatments, Eli Lilly's pill is not a peptide medication. That means it is absorbed more easily by the body and does not require dietary restrictions like Rybelsus or oral Wegovy does.In a note in August, Goldman Sachs analysts forecast that pills will capture a 24% share — or around $22 billion — of the 2030 global weight loss drug market, which they expect to be worth $95 billion in total.They said they expect Eli Lilly's pill to have a 60% share — or roughly $13.6 billion — of the daily oral segment of the market in 2030. They expect Novo Nordisk's oral semaglutide to have a 21% share — or around $4 billion — of that segment.",

    "body": "Pavlo Gonchar | SOPA Images | Lightrocket | Getty ImagesInstacart will pay $60 million to settle allegations by the Federal Trade Commission that it misled users with false advertising and deployed \"unlawful subscription enrollment\" practices.The federal agency alleged that Instacart used deceptive tactics in its subscription signup and \"satisfaction guarantee\" advertising that caused consumers to pay more in fees, and prevented them from securing refunds.For example, the FTC said Instacart falsely dangled promises of \"free delivery\" to consumers on their first order, while shoppers were still required to pay a mandatory service fee to get their groceries delivered.The FTC also said that Instacart falsely advertised full refunds for users who had problems with their order.\"Instacart misled consumers by advertising free delivery services — and then charging consumers to have groceries delivered — and failing to disclose to consumers that signed up for a free trial that they would be automatically enrolled into its subscription program,\" Christopher Mufarrige, director of the FTC's Bureau of Consumer Protection, said in a statement.In a blog post, Instacart acknowledged the FTC settlement but denied \"any allegations of wrongdoing by the agency.\"Read more CNBC tech newsGoogle and Nvidia VC arms back vibe coding startup Lovable at $6.6 billion valuationMetaX and Moore Threads' IPOs underscore Chinese chipmakers' growing challenge to NvidiaInstacart shares drop on report that FTC is probing company over AI pricing toolAmazon says AI chief Rohit Prasad is leaving, Peter DeSantis to lead 'AGI' groupThe grocery delivery platform said it uses \"straightforward marketing, transparent pricing and fees, clear terms, easy cancellation, and generous refund policies\" that comply with the law.\"This settlement allows us to move forward and remain focused on what's important to our company: delivering value for customers, shoppers, and retail and brand partners in the communities we serve,\" an Instacart spokesperson said.The move comes as Instacart reportedly faces a separate probe by the FTC into its pricing practices. The probe was launched after a wide-ranging study was released last week showing that its algorithmic pricing tools caused shoppers to pay different prices for identical items from the same store.News of the FTC probe sent Instacart shares lower by about 7% in extended trading on Wednesday. The stock was down more than 1% on Thursday.The FTC has recently ramped its scrutiny of companies alleged to be using deceptive billing and enrollment schemes.It sued Uber in April, claiming the ride-hail provider charged users for Uber One subscriptions without their consent. On Monday, 21 states joined the agency's lawsuit as part of an amended complaint.In September, the agency sued Live Nation and Ticketmaster for allegedly using \"bait-and-switch\" pricing tactics and illegally coordinating with ticket brokers.Earlier this month, the FTC said it was sending more than $27.6 million to consumers who were unknowingly enrolled in and charged for plans that shipped them products marketed to promote weight loss, clear skin and other healthcare benefits.watch now",

    "body": "The Lululemon logo can be seen on a store in Manhattan.Sven Hoppe | Picture Alliance | Getty ImagesActivist investor Elliott Investment Management has built a stake of more than $1 billion in Lululemon Athletica and is bringing a potential CEO candidate to the table, a person familiar with the matter told CNBC.Lululemon's stock rose 6% in early trading Thursday. Last week, Lululemon announced CEO Calvin McDonald would step down effective Jan. 31, following a year-long performance slump for Lululemon. Elliott has been working with former Ralph Lauren CFO and COO Jane Nielsen as a potential candidate, according to the person, who spoke on the condition of anonymity about confidential matters.In a news release announcing McDonald's departure, the company said its board of directors was working with a \"leading executive search firm\" to find its next CEO. The leadership change came as Lululemon's founder Chip Wilson has been calling on the company to make a change, saying earlier this year that the company's performance is \"in a nosedive.\"The athletic apparel company has been facing an increasingly crowded landscape, with athleisure entrants like Vuori and Alo Yoga. Nielsen served at Ralph Lauren from 2016 until April. Before that, she held roles at Coach and PepsiCo. Elliott has taken a stake in a slate of other companies as well this year, including a more than $2 billion stake in Workday and a $4 billion stake in PepsiCo. The Wall Street Journal earlier reported Elliott's Lululemon stake. ",

    "body": "The Bank of England (BOE) in the City of London, UK, on Monday, Dec. 15, 2025. Bloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesThursday's bonanza of four European central banks announcing interest rate decisions was as expected: the European Central Bank, Norges Bank, and Riksbank held their rates, while the Bank of England cut.But there were hints at what's ahead for 2026. Here are four key takeaways.1. The BoE voted to cut, but only justThe markets thought the BoE's rate cut was a done deal, with futures markets suggesting an almost 98% chance of one. But the vote to cut by 25 basis points was by the narrowest of margins: 5-4. A number of officials called for caution, citing continued risks to inflation.Rate setter Meghan Greene, who was among the four opposing a cut, argued there were signs inflation for services was at risk of spiking, while inflation for core goods remained at pre-Covid levels.Barclays U.K. Chief Economist Jack Meaning told CNBC the bank had delivered a \"hawkish cut,\" adding the bar could be higher for future cuts.watch now2. The ECB projections seem to justify the holdThe ECB's latest projections seem to have backed up European officials who have said rates are in a \"good place,\" with the growth outlook upgraded and inflation seen returning to the 2% target in 2028.President Christine Lagarde said the Eurozone's economy has been \"resilient\", while Al Cattermole, Mirabaud Asset Management fixed income portfolio manager, said the outlook was \"slightly hotter\" than expected, and means the committee will \"lean more towards that hawkish edge.\"3. But its next decision could be a hikeThe ECB leaving its policy rate unchanged came as little surprise to investors, with resilient economic data suggesting rates will remain on pause.But investors say that, by raising its growth outlook for the euro zone, the bank may have laid the groundwork for its next move to be a rate hike, as hinted at by governing member Isabel Schnabel.Schnabel told Bloomberg that she was \"rather comfortable\" with expectations that the next move could be a rate hike, \"albeit not any time soon.\"\"The prevailing narrative is that the rate-cutting cycle has largely run its course and that Europe's growth momentum now lies primarily in fiscal policy. Some even suggest that the ECB could begin raising policy rates again by the end of 2026,\" noted Kevin Thozet, a member of French asset manager Carmignac's investment committee.4. Don't expect Riksbank to move rates soonSweden's Riksbank boosted its economic outlook, now seeing 2.9% growth next year, compared to the 2.7% it previously expected.That has cemented expectations the central bank won't move rates anytime soon – with officials forecasting an eventual move higher after staying on hold throughout next year. Riksbank Governor Erik Thedéen told CNBC that Sweden is in \"a fairly good place,\" with growth picking up, while SEB Chief Economist Jens Magnusson said the country had \"one of the most promising growth cases for next year.\"",

    "body": "An Olive Garden restaurant in Milpitas, California, US, on Tuesday, Dec. 16, 2025. David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesDarden Restaurants on Thursday reported strong sales growth, fueled by demand at Olive Garden and LongHorn Steakhouse as thrifty diners look for good deals.For the second straight quarter, the company hiked its full-year outlook for revenue growth, although it only reiterated its projections for its earnings. \"The second quarter exceeded our top-line expectations as every segment delivered positive same-restaurant sales,\" Darden CEO Rick Cardenas said in a statement.Shares of the company rose nearly 3% in morning trading.Here's what the company reported compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:Earnings per share: $2.08 adjusted vs. $2.10 expectedRevenue: $3.1 billion vs. $3.07 billion expectedDarden reported fiscal second-quarter net income of $237.2 million, or $2.03 per share, up from $215.1 million, or $1.82 per share, a year earlier. Higher ingredient costs, particularly for near-record prices for beef, weighed on the company's restaurant-level margin, CFO Raj Vennam said on the company's conference call.Excluding restaurant closure costs and expenses related to its acquisition of Chuy's, the restaurant company earned $2.08 per share.Net sales rose 7.3% to $3.1 billion.Darden's same-store sales increased 4.3% in the quarter, topping Wall Street estimates of 3%, according to StreetAccount. While the broader restaurant industry has seen sluggish sales growth, Darden has found success by raising its menu prices by less than inflation and adding promotions aimed at diners looking for value.\"Weaker consumer sentiment doesn't necessarily translate into reduced spending during the quarter,\" Cardenas said during the conference call. He said the company saw high-income consumers trade into its casual-dining chains, although demand from diners making less than $50,000 fell slightly. Darden also got a traffic bump from consumers who are at least 55 years old.Restaurant resultsOlive Garden, which accounted for roughly 44% of Darden's quarterly sales, reported same-store sales growth of 4.7%. Executives credited the popularity of the Italian chain's $13.99 Never Ending Pasta Bowl promotion that ran during the quarter, plus Olive Garden's growing delivery business. In an appeal to inflation-weary consumers, Olive Garden is also adding the option of smaller portions at a lower price for select menu items. Cardenas said the change is improving its value perception among some diners. About 40% of the chain's locations offered the lighter portions menu during the quarter, and another 20% added it early in the fiscal third quarter. LongHorn Steakhouse saw same-store sales growth of 5.9%. While Olive Garden still outnumbers LongHorn based on its restaurant footprint, the steakhouse chain's sales are growing faster. Cardenas said LongHorn saw higher traffic from consumers who make less than $50,000, despite the chain's higher average check relative to Olive Garden. He credited higher beef prices, which mean that a steak at LongHorn could be the same price or cheaper than buying one from the grocery store.watch nowThe company's other business segment reported same-store sales growth of 3.1%, fueled by strong demand at Yard House, according to Cardenas.Darden's fine-dining business, which includes Ruth's Chris and The Capital Grille, saw same-store sales growth of 0.8%, bucking the malaise of the sector. The broader fine-dining segment has struggled as consumers spend less when dining out and many companies have cut back on business lunches and other expenses. Darden tried to appeal to those budget-conscious diners by bringing back a deal at Ruth's Chris for a three-course meal priced at $55 per person. \"It's a profitable deal for us,\" Cardenas said.For fiscal 2026, Darden now expects total sales growth of 8.5% to 9.3%, up from its prior forecast of 7.5% to 8.5%. The fiscal year includes a 53rd week, which is expected to contribute about 2%. Darden also adjusted its expectations for inflation to 3.5%, on the high end of its prior range of 3% to 3.5%. Higher costs will weigh on the company's margins, leading the company to reiterate its forecast for adjusted earnings in a range of $10.50 to $10.70 per share.",

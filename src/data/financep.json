    "body": "Elon Musk has called for the European Union to be abolished after the bloc fined his social media company X 120 million euros ($140 million) for a \"deceptive\" blue checkmark and lack of transparency of its advertising repository. The European Commission hit X with the ruling on Friday following a two-year investigation into the company under the Digital Services Act (DSA), which was adopted in 2022 to regulate online platforms. At the time, in a reply on X to a post from the Commission, Musk wrote, \"Bulls---.\"On Saturday he stepped up his criticism of the bloc. \"The EU should be abolished and sovereignty returned to individual countries, so that governments can better represent their people,\" he said in a post on X.Musk's comments come as top U.S. government officials have also intensified their opposition to the decision.Secretary of State Marco Rubio called the fine an \"attack on all American tech platforms and the American people by foreign governments,\" in a post on X on Friday. \"Today's excessive €120M fine is the result of EU regulatory overreach targeting American innovation,\" said Andrew Puzder, the U.S. ambassador to the EU, on X on Saturday. \"The Trump Administration has been clear: we oppose censorship and will challenge burdensome regulations that target US companies abroad. We expect the EU to engage in fair, open, & reciprocal trade — & nothing less.\"Last week, the Commission said breaches included \"the deceptive design of its 'blue checkmark,' the lack of transparency of its advertising repository, and the failure to provide access to public data for researchers.\"\"With the DSA's first non-compliance decision, we are holding X responsible for undermining users' rights and evading accountability,\" said Henna Virkkunen, executive vice president for tech sovereignty, security and democracy, at the time.X now has 60 days to inform the Commission of plans to address the issues with \"deceptive\" blue checkmarks. It has 90 days to submit a plan to resolve the issues with its ads repository and access to its public data for researchers.\"Failure to comply with the non-compliance decision may lead to periodic penalty payments,\" the Commission said in a statement.X.ai, the company which owns X, and the Commission have been approached for comment. oh ",

    "body": "Dado Ruvic | ReutersNextEra Energy is partnering with Exxon Mobil, the country's largest oil company, to build a large data center site powered by natural gas for a potential tech customer, CEO John Ketchum told investors Monday The 1.2 gigawatt power plant would combine gas generation with Exxon's carbon capture technology to reduce emissions, according to NextEra's presentation to investors. They plan to market the site to a hyperscaler in the first quarter of 2026. Hyperscalers are the big tech companies that are building data centers to train and run artificial intelligence applications. There is no signed agreement with a hyperscaler yet. NextEra and Exxon have secured 2,500 acres of land for the facility. The site will be located in the Southeast in close proximity to Exxon's carbon dioxide pipeline infrastructure, according to NextEra. NextEra is the largest renewable energy developer in the U.S., but it is leaning into natural gas to meet the growing demand from data centers. The power company plans to bring as much as 8 gigawatts of gas generation online by 2032, and is developing a pipeline of 20 gigawatts of gas generation. NextEra plans to build 15 gigawatts of power for data center hubs by 2035, Ketchum said. That includes at least three data center campuses that NextEra is developing with Alphabet's Google. \"A lot of those will get started with what I call bridge power — renewables, storage,\" the CEO said. \"We're also at that same time planning for the gas to come behind it.\"The tech sector has primarily secured renewables and increasingly nuclear power to supply data centers in an effort to meet its climate targets.

Media and Technology Conference in Sun Valley, Idaho, U.S., on Friday, July 12, 2019.Patrick T. Fallon / Bloomberg / Getty ImagesWarren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway announced a number of structural changes before the legendary CEO steps aside at the end of this year, among them the departure of Todd Combs, investment manager and Geico CEO.Combs, 54, will be joining JPMorgan Chase as head of the bank's new Security and Resiliency Initiative, to find direct equity investments in the defense, aerospace, health care and energy industries.Combs \"has resigned to accept an interesting and important job at JPMorgan,\" said Buffett, 95, in a press release from Berkshire. \"Todd made many great hires at Geico and broadened its horizons. JPMorgan, as usually is the case, has made a good decision.\"Combs joined Berkshire in 2010 from his hedge fund Castle Point and was brought in, along with Ted Weschler, to help manage Berkshire's portfolio of investments. Buffett is handing over the CEO reins to Greg Abel in 2026 and Combs' departure leaves some questions as to how the sizable equity holdings of Berkshire, which include Apple, Bank of America and Coca-Cola, will continue to be managed when he steps down. Berkshire shares traded lower on Monday following the management changes with perhaps some concern that other executives could depart when Buffett is no longer at the helm. Berkshire's B shares were last off by about 2.5%.Among some of the other notable changes at Berkshire are the retirement effective in June 2027 of Chief Financial Officer Marc Hamburg, who served under Buffett for 40 years. Charles Chang, current CFO of Berkshire Hathaway Energy will succeed him. Nancy Pierce, chief operating officer of Geico, will replace Combs as CEO of Geico. The conglomerate also said the CEO of its NetJets unit, Adam Johnson, will serve in a new role as president of Berkshire's consumer products, service and retailing businesses. Abel will directly oversee the remaining noninsurance businesses, Berkshire said.$1.5 trillion JPMorgan initiativeCombs, who was a member of JPMorgan's board of directors, will also become a special advisor to CEO Jamie Dimon. Combs is giving up his board seat as he moves into the new role.\"Todd Combs is one of the greatest investors and leaders I've known, having successfully managed investments alongside the most respected and successful long-term investor of our time, Warren Buffett,\" said Dimon in a release. \"Having served nine years on our Board, he truly understands all aspects of our company, and he supports the role we play helping make the world better and safer for all its citizens.\"Combs will have $10 billion to deploy to start with for JPMorgan's new initiative, which the bank said will ultimately commit $1.5 trillion to spur economic growth and \"to make the world more secure.\"The Security and Resiliency Initiative will have an outside council to guide its strategy which includes, Amazon's Jeff Bezos, Dell Chairman Michael Dell, former Secretary of Defense Robert Gates and former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconBerkshire B shares, YTDDespite his advanced age, Buffett surprised shareholders at the conglomerate's annual meeting in May when he said he would be stepping aside for Abel, who is 63 and current vice chairman of noninsurance operations. The stock has underperformed this year in part because of angst over what Berkshire will look like after Buffett, who took over the textiles manufacturer in 1965 and turned it into an investment holding company that went on to post an unprecedented long-term track record. Berkshire shares are up 9% this year, below the 16.6% return of the S&P 500. Buffett, who will remain chairman, noted in a Thanksgiving message that he still feels good, however he is moving slowly and reading with \"increasing difficulty.\"",

This decision will not weaken the Justice Department and it will not weaken me,\" Habba said. \"Make no mistake, you can take the girl out of New Jersey, but you cannot take the New Jersey out of the girl.\"Bondi said on X, \"I am saddened to accept Alina's resignation.\"\"The court's ruling has made it untenable for her to effectively run her office, with politicized judges pausing trials designed to bring violent criminals to justice,\" Bondi said. \"These judges should not be able to countermand the President's choice of attorneys entrusted with carrying out the executive branch's core responsibility of prosecuting crime.\"Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche appointed three people to supervise the criminal, civil and appellate, and administrative functions of the New Jersey U.S. Attorney's Office in light of Habba's departure.Lindsey Halligan, another former lawyer for Trump, was also recently disqualified by a judge from serving as the top federal prosecutor for the Eastern District of Virginia because of the circumstances of her appointment.Because of Halligan's disqualification, the grand jury indictments she obtained against former FBI Director James Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James were dismissed last month.Bondi appointed Habba as interim U.S.  Attorney in March after her predecessor resigned.Trump later nominated her to hold the post permanently, but her nomination was never considered by the Senate, as is required. The DOJ engaged in a byzantine series of maneuvers that it argued enabled Habba to automatically become the acting U.S. attorney, but a federal judge and then the 3rd Circuit rejected that effort, saying they failed to comply with the Federal Vacancies Reform Act.— Additional reporting by Justin Papp and Garrett Downs",

    "body": "Ray Dalio, founder of Bridgewater, speaking to CNBC at the Future Investment Institute 2025 summit in Riyadh on Oct. 28th, 2025.CNBCThe Middle East is fast emerging as one of the world's most powerful AI hubs, Bridgewater Associates' founder Ray Dalio said Monday, comparing the region's rise to Silicon Valley's pull for all things tech. Speaking to CNBC, Dalio said the United Arab Emirates and its neighbors have combined vast pools of capital with an influx of global talent, creating a magnet for investment managers and AI innovators alike.The UAE and Saudi Arabia have this year launched multibillion-dollar initiatives to build cloud, data centers and other AI infrastructure, underpinned by sovereign-wealth capital and global tech partnerships. A $10 billion agreement between Google Cloud and Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund announced this year aims to create a \"global AI hub\" in the country, as part of a broader push to host data-centers and AI workloads locally.Earlier this year, technology giants OpenAI, Oracle, Nvidia and Cisco combined forces to build a major Stargate artificial intelligence campus in the United Arab Emirates.When asked if he thinks that the UAE, Saudi Arabia and Qatar can be leaders in the AI race, Dalio said, \"What they've done is to create talented people. So this [region] is kind of becoming a Silicon Valley of capitalists ... So now people are coming in … money is coming in, talent is coming in.\"watch nowDalio, who has been visiting Abu Dhabi for more than three decades, said the Gulf's transformation is the result of deliberate statecraft and long-term planning. He described the UAE as \"a paradise in a world that's troubled,\" citing its leadership, stability, quality of life and ambition to build a globally competitive financial ecosystem.\"There's a buzz here, the way there's a buzz in San Francisco, places like that, about AI or technology. It's very similar to that,\" Dalio said.'Precarious' next two yearsThe Bridgewater founder warned that the global economy was headed toward an uncertain future in the near term due to a confluence of multiple forces, reiterating his concerns about markets being in bubble.  \"The next year or two in the future is going to be more precarious,\" he said, pointing to the convergence of what he calls the three dominant cycles: debt, U.S. political conflict and geopolitics.The global debt overhang is already forcing stress into pockets of the market.\"We're seeing cracks in the markets in a number of ways, private equity, venture capital, debt that's being refinanced, and all of those. So we are in a bubble, I believe, by almost all of those measures,\" Dalio said, highlighting similarities with the 2000 bubble but not the one in 1929.He also expects U.S. politics to become more disruptive heading into 2026. \"As we go into the 2026 elections … you will see a lot more conflict in different ways,\" Dalio said, adding that elevated interest rates and concentrated market leadership compound the vulnerability.\"Every country … cannot continue to accumulate the debt they have, yet politically they can't raise taxes and they can't cut benefits. So they're stuck.\" That fiscal bind feeds into a broader rise in domestic polarization: \"We now have populism of the left and populism of the right … which means irreconcilable differences.\"Dalio reiterated his view that the AI rally is in bubble territory, but advised investors not to rush for exits just because valuations are stretched.Concerns about an AI bubble have been swirling in recent months, with notable voices such as OpenAI CEO Sam Altman suggesting that the AI market was in a bubble. Investor Michael Burry, who called the 2008 subprime mortgage crash, has forecast the artificial intelligence market bubble could collapse in the next two years. \"All the bubbles took place in times of great technological change,\" Dalio said. \"You don't want to get out of it just because of the bubble. You want to look for the pricking of the bubble.\"The catalyst for that \"pricking,\" he said, usually comes from a tightening of money or a forced need to sell wealth to meet obligations. He also warned of stress in venture capital, private equity and commercial real estate, sectors where cheap debt is now rolling over at higher rates. ",

Michael Ochs Archives | Moviepix | Getty ImagesIn the dwindling days of the California gold rush, the wife of a local miner faced a problem. Her husband's denim work pants kept ripping, so her tailor, Jacob Davis, had the idea to add copper rivets to key points of strain, like the pocket corners and the base of the button fly, to keep them from tearing. Davis' \"riveted pants\" soon became a roaring success and, unbeknownst to him at the time, marked the official birth of the blue jean, a garment that would transform fashion and come to represent the United States around the globe. \"It really has democratized American fashion and it also is the greatest export that we have sent to the world, because people identify jeans specifically with American Western culture,\" said Shawn Grain Carter, a fashion professor at the Fashion Institute of Technology in New York. \"It doesn't matter your economic or social class. It doesn't matter what your views are in terms of the political spectrum. Everybody wears denim.\" Jacob DavisCourtesy: Levi Strauss & Co.These days, denim is a major sales driver for retailers big and small, as the global denim market reached $101 billion this year, up 28% from 2020, according to data from market research company Euromonitor International. Major apparel companies from American Eagle to Levi Strauss are in a race to corner that market, leaning on A-list celebrities like Sydney Sweeney and Beyonce to win over shoppers and drive sales in an unsteady economy.But if it weren't for Levi Strauss, founder of the eponymous blue jeans company, Davis' invention may not have gone far beyond the railroad town where it was created in the early 1870s. How Levi's created blue jeansSoon after Davis created his riveted pants, called \"waist overalls\" or \"overalls\" at the time, they began selling like \"hot cakes\" and he needed a business partner to secure a patent, said Tracey Panek, Levi's in-house historian. So he wrote to Strauss, a Bavarian-born immigrant who was running a successful wholesale business in San Francisco and had supplied Davis the denim he used to create his riveted pants. \"The secret of them Pents is the Rivits that I put in those Pockets and I found the demand so large that I cannot make them up fast enough,\" Davis wrote Strauss in a letter, according to PBS. Levi StraussCourtesy: Levi Strauss & Co.Strauss, an \"astute\" businessman, recognized the opportunity and agreed to partner with Davis, said Panek. \"This would have been the first time that Levi was actually\" manufacturing his own products, said Panek. \"He was no longer just importing and selling other people's goods. He was manufacturing himself and selling to retailers.\"On May 20, 1873, the two men secured a patent for the riveted pants and eventually opened a factory on Fremont Street, close to the modern-day Salesforce tower in San Francisco's financial district. They promised to offer workers the most durable jeans on the market and soon, business was booming. Dude ranch duds and the American worker Through Strauss' connections as a wholesaler, the company's riveted overalls soon spread across the U.S., becoming the garment of choice for working men everywhere: miners, cowboys, farmers – any role that required durable clothing. Jeans were exclusively reserved for work settings at the time, but as emerging denim manufacturers vied for a similar customer base, they looked to expand their assortment to drive sales. \"Slowly and steadily into the 20th century, you start to see some of these manufacturers making variations,\" said Sonya Abrego, a New York City-based fashion historian. \"There was this one design called spring bottom pants that was kind of a more form fitted, a more dressed up, a slightly flared, maybe what the factory foreman would be wearing, right? As opposed to just the guy on the shop floor.\"In 1934, Levi created the first ever line of jeans for women. Around that time, denim started to become more popular in settings outside of work, primarily for activities like dude ranch vacations, camping and horseback riding. \"So they were kind of taking on a cowboy's garment or a worker's garment but wearing it in a … resort setting,\" said Abrego. Courtesy: Levi Strauss & Co. Dude ranch vacations had become popular because there were finally highways connecting different parts of the country, and few were willing to venture to Europe during a war. Companies like Levi began releasing advertisements highlighting their denim as \"dude ranch duds\" and \"authentic western riding wear\" to capture shoppers looking for jeans to bring with them on vacation, according to archival advertisements from the time. These cultural moments helped to expand denim beyond workers, but jeans didn't become widespread casual attire until after World War II, when American fashion overall started to shift. The rise of the backyard BBQ By the time World War II ended, the mighty American consumer was beginning to emerge. For years, Americans had been forced to ration common goods like rubber, sugar and meat while simultaneously being encouraged to save their money by buying war bonds and socking away spare cash.When the country shifted from wartime to peacetime, Americans were ready to splurge and soon began spending big on new cars, appliances and clothes. \"With a little bit more money to spend, you start seeing a bigger push for leisure clothes and fun clothes and play clothes, clothes to wear to backyard barbecues,\" said Abrego. \"Clothes that we would consider today as just like casual style.\" Courtesy: Levi Strauss & Co.Slowly and surely, it became more and more acceptable for both men and women to wear jeans outside of work settings. Then, denim manufacturers made a push to allow jeans in schools. \"They wanted to sell to as many people as they possibly could,\" said Abrego. \"The idea that jeans are good for school means that they're good for every day.\"By the time the 1960s hit, denim manufacturers had expanded their products and were selling a wide variety of colors, fits and styles. It became a symbol of the hippie movement and a mainstay on Hollywood sets. Soon, denim was everywhere, and the 1970s brought the iconic bell bottom pants and the first iteration of the \"designer jean\" — denim pants being produced by labels and brands whose designs had nothing to do with work wear or western wear, like Calvin Klein and Gloria Vanderbilt. Since then, denim has remained a constant in global fashion. While silhouettes, washes and fits have changed over time, jeans never really go out of style, which is what makes them so enduring, said Abrego. \"This is a design from 1873 … do we see anything else from 1873 on the street? It's kind of wild if you think about it that way,\" said Abrego. \"We can talk about all the details, all the changes in manufacturing and all the different fits and finishes but it's a recognizable thing, it's still a pair of jeans. For me as a historian, that continuity is so compelling because I can't really name anything else that has stayed the same to this degree.\" ",

Sean Gallup | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesGoogle on Monday said it plans to launch the first of its AI-powered glasses in 2026, as the tech company ramps up its efforts to compete against Meta in a heating consumer market for AI devices. The Alphabet-owned company is collaborating on hardware design with Samsung, Gentle Monster and Warby Parker, with whom Google agreed to a $150 million commitment in May.Google plans to release audio-only glasses that will allow users to speak with the Gemini artificial-intelligence assistant, the company said in a blog. Google also said there will be glasses with an in-lens display that show users information such as navigation directions and language translations. The company said the first of these glasses will arrive next year, but it did not specify which styles that will include. In a Monday filing, Warby Parker said that the first of its glasses in partnership with Google are expected to launch in 2026.The glasses will be built on top of Android XR, Google's operating system for its headsets.Google's Monday updates come after the company in May announced that it would be getting back into the smart glasses game. At the time, co-founder Sergey Brin said he learned from Google's past mistakes of failed smart glasses, citing less advanced AI and a lack of supply chain knowledge, which led to expensive price points.\"Now, in the AI world, the things these glasses can do to help you out without constantly distracting you — that capability is much higher,\" Brin said in May.The AI wearables space has been gaining traction with Meta leading the pack. the social media company's Ray-Ban Meta glasses were met with surprising success. The glasses, which were designed in partnership with eyewear giant EssilorLuxottica, are infused with the Meta AI digital assistantMeta also released its own display glasses in September, which allows users to see features like messages, photo previews and live captions through a small display that's built into one of the device's lenses. Other companies like Snap and Alibaba have also been churning out their own AI glasses offerings as the small but competitive market continues to grow.Google on Monday also revealed more software updates to the Galaxy XR headset, including the ability to link it to Windows PCs and a travel mode that will allows the device to be used in planes and cars.WATCH: Google's vibe-coding playwatch now",

    "body": "NextEra Energy Chairman, President and CEO John Ketchum participates in a panel during CERAWeek in Houston, Texas, U.S., March 10, 2025. Kaylee Greenlee | ReutersNextEra Energy plans to build 15 gigawatts of new power generation for data center hubs by 2035, CEO John Ketchum told investors on Monday. NextEra is the largest renewable energy developer in the U.S. through NextEra Energy Resources, and also owns Florida Power & Light. The utility also operates a fleet of nuclear- and natural gas-powered plants. NextEra also announced a partnership with Alphabet's Google unit on Monday to develop three gigawatt scale data center campuses in the U.S. with plans to expand to additional locations. A gigawatt is roughly equivalent to more than 800,000 homes based on average household electricity consumption in 2024, according to the Energy Information Administration. Ketchum said the 15 gigawatts of power for data center hubs is a \"fairly conservative\" target. \"Quite frankly, based on what we're seeing today, we'll be disappointed if we don't do more,\" Ketchum said at NextEra's investor conference. There is potential upside to build 30 gigawatts of new generation by 2035, he said. The data center hubs will use all forms of energy, Ketchum said. NextEra announced a deal with Google in October to restart the Duane Arnold nuclear plant in Iowa through a power purchase agreement. The data center hubs will help NextEra meet its target of building four to eight gigawatts of new gas generation by 2032 and considerably more by 2035, Ketchum said. NextEra is developing a pipeline of 20 gigawats of gas generation. Ketchum acknowledged that the huge power demand from AI data centers is raising affordability concerns. He said the solution is for the big tech companies to bring their own power generation with them when they commit to build a data center. \"Hyperscalers can solve that problem by bringing and paying for their own power generation and infrastructure,\" the CEO said.

    "body": "watch nowParamount Skydance is launching a hostile bid to buy Warner Bros. Discovery after it lost out to Netflix in a monthslong bidding war for the legacy assets, the company said Monday. Paramount will go straight to WBD shareholders with an all-cash, $30 per share offer. That's the same bid WBD rejected last week and equates to an enterprise value of $108.4 billion. The offer is backstopped with equity financing from the Ellison family and the private equity firm RedBird Capital as well as $54 billion in debt commitments from Bank of America, Citi and Apollo Global Management, Paramount said in a news release. A portion of the equity financing comes from outside Middle Eastern financing partners including Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund, Abu Dhabi's L'imad Holding Company PJSC, and the Qatar Investment Authority. Another portion derives from Jared Kushner's Affinity Partners. Kushner is U.S. President Donald Trump's son-in-law. Those partners have agreed to \"forgo any governance rights,\" including board seats, as part of their non-voting equity investment, according to a Paramount filing. The modifications allow the deal to be outside of the jurisdiction of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S., or CFIUS. Shares of Paramount were 7% higher in morning trading Monday. Warner Bros. Discovery's shares were up about 5% while Netflix was down more than 4%.\"We're really here to finish what we started,\" Paramount Skydance CEO David Ellison told CNBC's \"Squawk on the Street\" on Monday. \"We put the company in play.\" Paramount Skydance began its hunt for Warner Bros. Discovery in September, submitting three bids before WBD launched a formal sale process that ultimately brought in other suitors. On Friday, Netflix announced a deal to acquire WBD's studio and streaming assets for a combination of cash and stock, valued at $27.75 per WBD share, or $72 billion. Paramount had been bidding for the entirety of Warner Bros. Discovery, including those assets and the company's TV networks like CNN and TNT Sports. \"We're sitting on Wall Street, where cash is still king. We are offering shareholders $17.6 billion more cash than the deal they currently have signed up with Netflix, and we believe when they see what it is currently in our offer that that's what they'll vote for,\" Ellison said. Ellison said Monday he places a value of $1 per share on the linear cable assets, which are set to trade as a separate public entity called Discovery Global in mid-2026. WBD executives have privately valued the assets closer to $3 per share. Paramount has repeatedly argued to the WBD board of directors that keeping Warner Bros. Discovery whole is in the best interest of its shareholders. Paramount made a bid on Dec. 1 and heard back from WBD that it needed to make certain alterations to the offer, Ellison said Monday. When Paramount made the changes and upped its bid to $30 per share, Ellison never heard back from WBD CEO David Zaslav, he said.Ellison said he told Zaslav via text message that $30 per share wasn't the company's best and final offer, suggesting the company is willing to bid higher still.Ellison argued Paramount's deal will have a shorter regulatory approval process given the company's smaller size and friendly relationship with the Trump administration. He called Trump a believer \"in competition\" and said Paramount's combination with WBD will be \"a real competitor to Netflix, a real competitor to Amazon.\"Ellison also threw cold water on Netflix's chances of regulatory approval.\"Allowing the No. 1 streaming service to combine with the No. 3 streaming service is anticompetitive,\" Ellison said.CNBC reported Friday that the Trump administration was viewing the deal with \"heavy skepticism,\" and Trump said Sunday that the market share considerations could pose a \"problem.\" Netflix agreed to pay Warner Bros. Discovery $5.8 billion if the deal is not approved, according to a Securities and Exchange Commission filing Friday. Warner Bros. Discovery said it would pay a $2.8 billion breakup fee if it decides to call off the deal to pursue a different merger.Netflix, for its part, once again championed the deal as positive for shareholders, consumers and the media industry as a whole when its top leadership spoke at the UBS Global Media and Communications Conference on Monday. Co-CEO Greg Peters said they recognize the Netflix deal came as a shock but called the Warner Bros. studio and HBO Max content complementary to Netflix's business.Co-CEO Ted Sarandos said the acquisition would protect jobs at a time when layoffs have been rampant across media: \"In the offer that Paramount was talking about today, they also were talking about $6 billion of synergies. Where do you think synergies come from? Cutting jobs. So we're not cutting jobs, we're making jobs.\" — CNBC's Lillian Rizzo contributed to this report. ",

The memo confirming that he plans to stay at Apple comes as the company has seen several high-profile executive exits in the past weeks, raising questions about the stability of Apple's top leadership.In addition to developing the chips that enabled Apple to drop Intel from its laptops and desktops, in recent years Srouji's teams have developed a cellular modem that will replace Qualcomm's modems in most iPhones. Srouji frequently presents at Apple product launches. \"I know you've been reading all kind of rumors and speculations about my future at Apple, and I feel that you need to hear from me directly,\" Srouji wrote in the memo. \"I am proud of the amazing Technologies we all build across Displays, Cameras, Sensors, Silicon, Batteries, and a very wide set of technologies, across all of Apple Products.\"Last week, Apple announced that its head of artificial intelligence, John Giannandrea, was stepping down.Two days later, the company announced the departure of Alan Dye, the head of user interface design.

As rising prices continue to affect consumers, President Donald Trump has pushed back on the idea that Americans are struggling financially. \"The word 'affordability' is a con job by the Democrats,\" Trump said during a cabinet meeting on Tuesday. \"The word 'affordability' is a Democrat scam.\"Lately, voters have expressed frustration with Trump's handling of the economy.

Andrew Caballero-Reynolds | AFP | Getty ImagesTensions are mounting once again between U.S. President Donald Trump and President Volodymyr Zelenskyy after the White House leader accused Ukraine's head of state of not even reading the U.S.' peace proposals yet.\"I'm a little bit disappointed that President Zelenskyy hasn't yet read the proposal, that was as of a few hours ago,\" Trump told reporters on Sunday night.  \"His people love it, but he hasn't [read it],\" Trump added.\"Russia, I guess, would rather have the whole country when you think of it, but Russia is, I believe, fine with it, but I'm not sure that Zelenskyy is fine with it,\" Trump said.It's uncertain which version of the U.S.-backed peace plan for Ukraine Trump was referring to but the president's comments came a day after talks between U.S. and Ukrainian officials ended in Miami without an apparent agreement over the latest version of a draft peace plan.There have been several versions of the purported peace plan as Russia and Ukraine have haggled — via their American intermediaries — over key details within the deal, particularly when it comes to demands for territorial concessions by Russia and security guarantees for Ukraine. Trump's outgoing Ukraine envoy Keith Kellogg remarked Sunday that a deal to end the war was \"really close\" and that it depended on resolving two main outstanding issues: the future of Ukraine's Donbas eastern region, which is broadly occupied by Russian forces, and the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in southern Ukraine.Ukraine has given a more cautious appraisal of the talks' progress with Zelenskyy saying in his nightly address Sunday that the Miami talks — held between his new chief negotiator Rustem Umerov and Ukraine's military chief of general staff, General Andriy Hnatov, and Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff and son-in-law Jared Kushner — were \"constructive, though not easy.\" Zelenskyy said he would have a detailed debrief with his negotiating team in person rather than over the phone, noting, somewhat pointedly, that \"some matters can only be discussed in person.\"Talks move to LondonZelenskyy travelled to London for talks on Monday as Kyiv and its European allies scramble to ensure that Ukraine's territorial integrity and future security (as well as Europe's) are not compromised in the face of growing U.S. pressure to agree to peace proposals initially seen as heavily favorable to Russia.Zelenskyy met U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer, French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Friedrich Merz for talks \"which will focus on the ongoing peace negotiations and next steps,\" Downing Street said Sunday. Zelenskyy will also travel to Brussels and Rome for further talks this week.Britain's Prime Minister Keir Starmer talks to French President Emmanuel Macron during a meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and other European leaders amid negotiations to end the Russian war in Ukraine, at the White House in Washington, D.C., U.S., August 18, 2025. Alexander Drago | ReutersUkraine's European allies are anxious to be seen and heard as peace proposals are discussed without their involvement, particularly given the security ramifications any deal will have for the wider continent.The U.K. and France have been leading proponents of a \"Coalition of the Willing,\" a group of countries that could be part of a \"reassurance force\" in a post-war Ukraine that helps to guarantee its security. Russia vehemently opposes the idea of foreign troops being deployed in Ukraine, with Russian President Vladimir Putin saying they would be \"legitimate targets.\"European leaders will be feeling more nervous about the U.S.' potential for accommodating Russian demands after the release of Trump's latest national security strategy last Friday, which said Europe risked \"civilisational erasure\" and that it was \"far from obvious\" whether European countries can \"remain reliable allies.\" The document also stated that Washington should reestablish strategic stability with Russia.The Kremlin on Sunday praised the new strategy, saying it largely accorded with Russia's \"vision.\"While both the U.S. and Russia share a mutual desire for a future rapprochement, some distance remains when it comes to an immediate peace agreement over Ukraine. Talks between Witkoff, Kushner and Russian officials held in Moscow last week also concluded without a breakthrough, with Russian presidential aide Yuri Ushakov telling reporters that the discussions were \"very useful, constructive, and highly informative\" but that there was more work to be done.Russian President Vladimir Putin, presidential envoy Kirill Dmitriev and foreign policy aide Yuri Ushakov attend a meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff and son-in-law Jared Kushner at the Kremlin in Moscow, Russia, Dec. 2, 2025.Alexander Kazakov | Via ReutersThe Kremlin also commented on Trump's criticism of Zelenskyy, with Putin's Press Secretary Dmitry Peskov telling reporters Monday:\"We don't know exactly what disagreements there are. What matters to us is this: A thorough amount of work was done in Moscow during Putin's meeting with Witkoff and Kushner and afterward, Witkoff and Kushner continued working with the delegation of Ukrainian negotiators led by Umerov on the basis of the results achieved in Moscow,\" he said, in comments translated by NBC News.\"Now it's important for us to understand what the outcome of that work is. It's clear that both sides now understand that such work needs to be done in silence. This kind of work cannot be conducted entirely in public. It's counterproductive. Most importantly, it prevents results from being achieved. So we expect to receive this information. Once we do, things will become clear,\" he stated.",

Southwest was due to make the last payment next month.\"Southwest Airlines is grateful to [Transportation] Secretary [Sean] Duffy and the DOT Team for recognizing Southwest's significant investments in modernizing our operations,\" Southwest said Saturday. \"During the last two years, Southwest successfully completed an operational turnaround that directly benefits our Customers with industry leading on-time performance and percentage of completed flights without cancellations.\"Read more CNBC airline newsDelta says government shutdown cost it $200 million, but forecasts strong travel demand into 2026The government shutdown is over.

    "body": "Corn and soybean farmer Don Swanson prepares to harvest his corn crop as he and other Iowa farmers struggle with the effects of weather and ongoing tariffs resulting from the trade war between the U.S. and China that continue to affect agricultural business, in Eldon, Iowa, on Oct. 4, 2019.Kia Johnson | ReutersPresident Donald Trump announced Monday that his administration is doling out a $12 billion aid package to farmers who have been squeezed by a trade war between the U.S. and its top economic partners.The funds will come from U.S. tariff revenues, Trump said during a roundtable event at the White House.Most of that money — up to $11 billion — will go to the U.S. Agriculture Department's new Farmer Bridge Assistance program, which will provide one-time payments to row crop farmers, a White House official told CNBC earlier Monday.The remaining $1 billion will be reserved as the USDA evaluates changing market conditions, according to the official.The president was joined at the event by Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins, as well as members of Congress and farmers who raise cattle and grow corn, cotton, sorghum, soybean, rice, wheat and potatoes.Democratic lawmakers slammed the administration ahead of the announcement.\"Trump wants credit for trying to fix a mess of his making,\" said Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., in an X post.\"Trump's tariffs are hammering our farmers, making it more expensive to grow food and pushing farmers into bankruptcy,\" he wrote. \"Farmers need markets to sell to—not a consolation prize for the ones he wrecked.\"\"Trump's plan to bail out farmers won't even get agriculture communities back to even,\" Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon, the Senate Finance Committee's top-ranking Democrat, said in a statement. \"They're still paying more for fertilizer, equipment and seeds, while grown-in-the-USA farm goods are facing more obstacles than ever in foreign markets.\"The administration is framing the money as \"bridge payments\" that will help farmers weather the period between the U.S. abandoning former President Joe Biden's economic policies and Trump's current agenda kicking in.But some in America's agriculture industry say they are suffering as a result of the wide-ranging trade war — especially due to conflicts with China, a major U.S. customer.China stopped buying U.S. soybeans for several months, most notably during the key harvest season beginning in the fall.Beijing resumed purchasing some soybeans in late October as Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping neared a tentative trade truce. But China's imports of the crop do not appear to be rebounding to their current levels, and Beijing's stockpiles have swelled to recent highs.Bessent has maintained that China is on track to meet its projected purchase of 12 million metric tons of U.S. soybeans by the end of February. The administration has previously said that Beijing would hit the 12 million ton mark during the last two months of the year, and that it would buy at least 25 million tons of soybeans in each of the next three years. China bought nearly 27 million metric tons of U.S. soybeans in 2024.Read more CNBC politics coverageJudge dismisses James Comey and Letitia James cases over 'unlawful' prosecutor appointmentSen.

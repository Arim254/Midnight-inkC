    "body": "Shoppers in Walnut Creek, California, US, on Tuesday, Oct. 7, 2025. David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesPresident Donald Trump's tariffs are pushing inflation generally higher as companies are caught between absorbing the costs or passing them onto customers, according to a Federal Reserve report Wednesday.The central bank's periodic Beige Book report, published eight times a year generally at about six-week intervals, categorized overall economic growth as having \"changed little\" since the last report on Sept. 3. Labor markets \"were largely stable\" as demand was \"muted\" for most of the Fed's 12 districts.When it came to prices, though, Trump's duties implemented in April and then staggered through ensuing months showed an impact.\"Prices rose further during the reporting period,\" the report stated. \"Tariff-induced input cost increases were reported across many Districts, but the extent of those higher costs passing through to final prices varied.\"In some cases, firms held prices unchanged to stay competitive and to appease inflation-sensitive clients. However, some businesses said they were \"fully passing higher import costs along to their customers.\"A few districts reported that slowing demand actually pushed prices down for materials.The trade war has escalated in recent days as China has ordered restrictions on coveted rare earths materials, while Trump has retaliated with a threat of 100% tariffs on Chinese imports.The release comes amid a dearth of relevant economic data due to a government shutdown entering its third week. Key providers such as the Labor and Commerce departments are largely closed due to the impasse.However, Bureau of Labor Statistics workers have been called back to release the pivotal consumer price index report used both as an inflation gauge and to index cost of living adjustments for Social Security recipients. The CPI reading, which normally would have been released Wednesday, will come out Oct. 24, the last inflation reading the Fed will get before its policy meeting Oct. 28-29.The Beige Book said consumer spending nudged lower in recent weeks, though it noted \"strong\" spending on luxury items and travel by upper-income earners. Lower and medium earners, meanwhile, pursued discounts and promotions.Future expectations improved in some districts, though Philadelphia reported caution over a prolonged government shutdown.",

The Supreme Court is scheduled to hear arguments on Nov. 5 on Trump's request that it overturn lower-court rulings, which found that a president does not have authority under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to impose the country-specific tariffs he implemented earlier this year.The White House did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment on Trump's statement.",

The airline increased capacity 7% in the third quarter over last year. Unit passenger revenue for the three months ended Sept. 30 fell 3.3% for domestic travel and 7.1% for international. Sales from its lucrative loyalty program rose 9%.In an interview last month, United CEO Scott Kirby last month defended the airline's growth plan and said the carrier was winning loyal customers through its network, new technology like complimentary inflight Wi-Fi, refreshed cabins and new lounges.\"Those investments over almost a decade, combined with great service from our people, have allowed United to win and retain brand-loyal customers, leading to economic resilience even with macro economic volatility through the first three quarters of the year and significant upside as the economy and demand are improving in the fourth quarter,\" Kirby said in a release on Wednesday.Still, for the third quarter, United beat earnings expectations, although its revenue fell short of estimates.Here is what United Airlines reported for the quarter that ended Sept. 30 compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on estimates compiled by LSEG:Earnings per share: $2.78 adjusted vs. $2.62 expectedRevenue: $15.23 billion vs. $15.33 billion expectedUnited's third-quarter revenue was $15.23 billion, up 2.6% from $14.84 billion last year. Net income fell 1.7% to $949 million or $2.90 a share. Adjusting for one-time items including debt, among other things, United posted income of $909 million or $2.78 a share.The carrier is vying with Delta Air Lines to win over more affluent travelers who shell out more for seats, and it has expanded its global network with far-flung destinations like Greenland and Mongolia. United said in the third quarter, its premium-cabin revenue, which includes first class and other, roomier seats, rose 6%. United's sales from no-frills basic economy 4% year-over-year.In the spring and early summer, United and other carriers trimmed their earnings forecasts they made at the start of the year, after passenger demand dipped amid on-again-off-again tariffs, and an oversupply of flights weighed on airfare.",

    "body": "John Furner, Walmart U.S. CEO, speaks to CNBC’s Sara Eisen during the Invest in America Forum on Oct. 15, 2025.Aaron Clamage | CNBCManufacturing is seeing renewed attention from corporate America, with Walmart among the major companies publicly reaffirming its commitment to domestic production. At CNBC's inaugural Invest in America Forum, Walmart U.S. CEO John Furner said the company is increasing its investments in U.S.-made products and suppliers, describing it as part of a long-standing, strategic priority. \"Investing in U.S. manufacturing and U.S. operations, sure, it's great for business, but it's also great for employment. It's great for jobs. It's great for the country, and it helps us with our supply chain being flexible and dynamic,\" Furner said. Nearly two-thirds of the products Walmart sells are made, grown or assembled in the United States, according to Furner. Walmart is expanding on that front, including a new beef processing facility in Olathe, Kansas, which he said is expected to create over 600 jobs. \"It's a big investment, and having quality products that are sourced in a more sustainable way that can deliver to customers is really important,\" Furner said. Furner also pointed to specific categories where domestic production is being revived, citing a recent partnership with USAntibiotics aimed at \"bringing back products like amoxicillin so that they're made here in the United States.\"Still, global sourcing remains essential for Walmart's operations. \"We source from all around the world,\" Furner said. \"There are things that are grown around the world that tend to do better in other climates, you know, coffee might be an example … I think there are a lot of possibilities.\"The heightened public focus on U.S. manufacturing comes amid trade policy uncertainty, with tariffs and interest rates remaining central to retailers' equation of how much inventory to stock and what to set prices at. For his part, Furner was uncertain about the future for the levies. \"As policies change, they'll change. Environments will change. That happens. Commodities change,\" he said. \"We've landed in a place where we have more rollbacks going into the fall than we had at the beginning of the year, and that's something we're proud of.\"Despite uncertain economic headwinds, Furner said Walmart is pushing to lower prices for consumers. \"We want to try to keep prices as low as we can, as long as we can,\" he said. \"We see a resilient customer that makes really smart choices for what's right for them and their families at the time of shopping.\"",

Carlos Osorio | ReutersBunge Global jumped more than 11% on Wednesday on the back of the Trump administration's threat to cut off U.S. purchases of Chinese cooking oil.Bunge is one of the largest soybean processors and cooking oil producers in the world. The stock's year to date gains are roughly 18%.President Donald Trump on Tuesday said the U.S. is considering \"terminating business with China having to do with Cooking Oil\" as a retaliatory action against Beijing's refusal to buy U.S. soybeans. China was the top buyer of American soybeans for years but has not bought a single soybean from the U.S. since May amid its trade war with the Trump administration. The country has instead been buying the crop from Argentina and Brazil due to Trump's high tariff rates on China.Trump's threat to China comes after China's used cooking oil exports surged to record highs last year, with the U.S. accounting for 43% of the total export number.Trade tensions between China and the U.S. have escalated in recent days. Late last week, President Donald Trump threatened to impose an additional 100% tariff on Chinese imports. That came after China placed new export controls on rare earth minerals. China this week then moved to tighten its grip in the global shipping space by sanctioning five U.S. subsidiaries from South Korea's Hanwha Group. Bunge earlier Wednesday also gave a full-year forecast that reflects its merger with grain and oilseeds processor Viterra. The company said it expects to earn $7.30 to $7.60 per share, excluding items, while analysts polled by FactSet expected $7.39 per share. Still, that appeared to be better than many investors feared.

Michael Short | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesSalesforce shares rose as much as 5% in extended trading on Wednesday after the software vendor issued new financial targets for the next few years.The company said it now expects revenue of over $60 billion in 2030, above the $58.37 billion consensus among analysts polled by LSEG.The guidance excludes impact from the pending acquisition of data management company Informatica. The $8 billion deal, announced in May, is slated to close in the fiscal fourth quarter or in the first quarter of the 2027 fiscal year.\"We have had some lower-stage growth for a while,\" Robin Washington, Salesforce's chief operating and financial officer, said during an investor briefing at the company's annual Dreamforce conference in San Francisco. \"That is reaccelerating.\"She company called for an organic year-over-year revenue growth rate above 10% in the 2026 through 2030 fiscal years. The growth rate has been under 10% since mid-2024.Investors have been concerned, in part because of the rise of \"vibe-coding\" tools for automatically generating software with a few words of human input. Industry observers have predicted that artificial intelligence services might threaten longstanding software providers. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said in April that AI is creating up to 30% of new code at the company.\"There's a certain amount of, let's just say, nonsense that's out there,\" Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff said on Wednesday. \"Like, for example, that these products are writing all the software, and that is not what's happening.\"As of Wednesday's close, Salesforce's stock had fallen 29% for the year, while the Nasdaq has gained 17%.To increase revenue, Salesforce is counting on its Agentforce software for automating customer service and other business processes, said Washington, who also sits on Salesforce's board. The company introduced Agentforce last year as a way for brands to add chat-based customer service agents that connect large language models to internal data.\"Investors continue to ask why Agentforce adoption has been slower than anticipated,\" analysts at RBC Capital Markets wrote in a note to clients earlier this month.Salesforce executives are hoping product enhancements will attract more business.The company on Monday released Agentforce Voice, which allows clients to have agents answer customer service calls. On Tuesday, Salesforce announced larger partnerships with AI model developers Anthropic and OpenAI, bringing their latest models to Agentforce.At Dreamforce, Salesforce pointed to Agentforce adoption at FedEx, Pandora, PepsiCo, Williams Sonoma and other companies.WATCH: People don't understand Agentforce is part and parcel of Salesforce, says CEO Marc Benioffwatch now",

Bloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesApple services chief Eddy Cue said the iPhone maker would like to buy more sports rights, but the company would need to be able to do something \"unique and special\" with the broadcast.\"We don't have to do sports the way that they are. There's plenty of people doing that,\" Cue told CNBC's Alex Sherman at the Autosport Business Exchange NYC.Apple TV, the company's streaming service, currently airs Major League Baseball games on Friday nights and has a package for Major League Soccer that allows subscribers to watch all MLS matches.But Apple hasn't secured rights to major American sports such as the National Football League, which sold its NFL Sunday Ticket package to Google's YouTube, or the National Basketball Association, which has some games appear on Amazon Prime.Apple Original Films released a licensed movie called \"F1\" this summer that made over $550 million at the box office. Cue declined to say if Apple had acquired broadcast rights to the F1 racing league.Cue, who is the senior vice president of services at Apple, said that there were a lot of things about sports broadcasts that he would like to fix, including blackouts, the need to subscribe to multiple services and issues with viewers accessing streams while traveling.He said that the way that Apple TV broadcasts MLS, in which viewers aren't blacked out and can stream games around the world, \"fixed\" some of those issues.\"If we want people to watch games, and we want all of sports to grow, some of these things need to be fixed,\" Cue said, suggesting that leagues could demand all of its broadcast partners work together to enable features like picture-in-picture when multiple games are playing at the same time but on different streaming services.When Apple broadcasts sports, the company is looking to create a \"level of differentiation\" from most broadcasts, said Cue, noting some of the things that Apple TV does with its MLB broadcasts.He said that Apple TV has better video quality than other broadcasters because it doesn't compress its video. He also cited a recent MLB broadcast in which Apple placed an iPhone on a foul pole for an unusual camera angle during the game.Ultimately, Apple would like to do deals with leagues to broadcast their games across international markets, rather than secure packages for individual games, as the company does now with MLB. Cue said that Friday Night Baseball, which debuted in 2022, was a \"test\" for Apple to figure out what it was getting into.\"You had to start somewhere to learn a little bit about what it takes to broadcast before you decide to take on a whole league and broadcast worldwide,\" Cue said.WATCH: Apple's China shipments grow 0.6%watch now",

    "body": "Sam Altman, chief executive officer of OpenAI Inc., during a media tour of the Stargate AI data center in Abilene, Texas, US, on Tuesday, Sept. 23, 2025. Kyle Grillot | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesOpenAI CEO Sam Altman said Wednesday that the company is \"not the elected moral police of the world\" after receiving backlash over his decision to loosen restrictions and allow content like erotica within its chatbot ChatGPT.The artificial intelligence startup has expanded its safety controls in recent months as it faced mounting scrutiny over how it protects users, particularly minors.But Altman said Tuesday in a post on X that OpenAI will be able to \"safely relax\" most restrictions now that it has new tools and has been able to mitigate \"serious mental health issues.\"In December, Altman said it will allow more content, including erotica, on ChatGPT for \"verified adults.\"Altman tried to clarify the move in a post on X on Wednesday, saying OpenAI cares \"very much about the principle of treating adult users like adults,\" but it will still not allow \"things that cause harm to others.\"\"In the same way that society differentiates other appropriate boundaries (R-rated movies, for example) we want to do a similar thing here,\" Altman wrote.The posts are at odds with comments Altman made during a podcast appearance in August, where he said he was \"proud\" of OpenAI's ability to resist certain features, like a \"sex bot avatar,\" that could boost engagement on ChatGPT.\"There's a lot of short-term stuff we could do that would really juice growth or revenue and be very misaligned with that long-term goal,\" Altman said. Read more CNBC tech news$1 trillion-worth of AI deals between OpenAI, Nvidia and others, in one chartWaymo plans robotaxi launch in London, marking its European debutASML looks to calm fears over 2026 growth as it warns of China sales declineMeta removes Facebook page allegedly used to target ICE agents after pressure from DOJIn September, the Federal Trade Commission launched an inquiry into OpenAI and other tech companies over how chatbots like ChatGPT could negatively affect children and teenagers. OpenAI is also named in a wrongful death lawsuit with a family who blamed ChatGPT for their teenage son's death by suicide.The company has taken several public steps to enhance safety on ChatGPT in the months following the inquiry and the lawsuit. It launched a series of parental controls late last month, and it is building an age prediction system that will automatically apply teen-appropriate settings for users under 18.On Tuesday, OpenAI announced assembled a council of eight experts who will provide insight into how AI impacts users' mental health, emotions and motivation. Altman posted about the company's aim to loosen restrictions that same day, sparking confusion and swift backlash on social media.Altman said it \"blew up\" much more than he was expecting.His post also caught the attention of advocacy groups like the National Center on Sexual Exploitation, which called on OpenAI to reverse its decision to allow erotica on ChatGPT.\"Sexualized AI chatbots are inherently risky, generating real mental health harms from synthetic intimacy; all in the context of poorly defined industry safety standards,\" Haley McNamara, NCOSE's executive director, said in a statement on Wednesday.If you are having suicidal thoughts or are in distress, contact the Suicide & Crisis Lifeline at 988 for support and assistance from a trained counselorWATCH: AI is not in a bubble, valuations look ‘pretty reasonable’, says BlackRockwatch now",

    "body": "President Donald Trump holds a news conference with Elon Musk to mark the end of the Tesla CEO's tenure as a special government employee overseeing the U.S. DOGE Service on Friday May 30, 2025 in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington. Tom Brenner | The Washington Post | Getty ImagesGeneral Motors' announcement on Tuesday that its upcoming quarterly results will include a $1.6 billion charge from its electric vehicle investments is the latest in a string of troubling EV-related disclosures from big automakers.Ford CEO Jim Farley said late last month that he expects demand for fully electric vehicles to be slashed in half following the end of a federal tax credit program. His prediction came after Stellantis, the parent company of auto brands including Chrysler and Jeep, said it was scrapping its target of producing nothing but electric vehicles in Europe by 2030, and backed off ambitious targets for the U.S., notably for Chrysler.The industry, which was already facing hurdles imposed by the Trump administration, faces a hefty dose of uncertainty now that consumers can no longer take advantage of $7,500 tax credits for purchasing EVs. The incentives expired at the end of September as part of President Trump's signature spending bill.As automakers reset investor expectations, one name has been notably absent from the conversation: Tesla.Elon Musk's company is by far the largest seller of EVs in the U.S., though its market share has been sliding as competition has increased and its brand value has declined. Tesla's share of the all-electric market in the U.S. was estimated at 43.1% at the end of September, down from 49% at the end of last year, according to data provided to CNBC from Motor IntelligenceTesla is slated to report third-quarter results next week, and Wall Street will be eager to hear what kind of demand the company expects with the credits no longer available. Tesla recently unveiled stripped-down, lower-cost variants of its popular Model Y SUV and Model 3 sedans, offsetting some of the effective price increases that come with the loss of incentives.watch nowSteve Greenfield, general partner at investment firm Automotive Ventures, said the retreat of legacy automakers from the segment could be good news for Tesla as its market share may start to rebound. He said in an email that the company has \"very strong brand loyalty.\"\"Chances are, most Tesla buyers will continue to stay in the brand, as they buy their next new car,\" Greenfield said.However, significant challenges loom. Interest in battery electric vehicles \"is very likely to shrink dramatically\" in the fourth quarter, he said, due to the \"pull-ahead of demand,\" as consumers rushed to buy EVs before the credit expired. As the year ends, Tesla will likely face a \"double whammy,\" Greenfield said, from reduced BEV sales and lower margins on the cars they do sell.Tesla didn't respond to a request for comment.Investors have become more bullish. Following a 36% slump in the first quarter, the stock has rallied and is now up more than 7% for the year, aided by Musk's purchase of about $1 billion worth of Tesla stock in September.The brutal start to the year was linked to a consumer backlash in the U.S. and Europe in response to Musk's incendiary political rhetoric, his work for President Trump slashing the federal workforce, and his endorsements of far-right groups including Germany's AfD party.Sharing in the painIn the company's third-quarter earnings scheduled for next Wednesday, analysts are expecting to see revenue growth of 3.5% from a year earlier to $26.1 billion, according to LSEG. Analysts are projecting a revenue drop in the fourth quarter and a 3.5% slide for all of 2025, which would mark the first full-year decline on record.Earlier this month, Tesla reported a 7% year-over-year increase in quarterly vehicle deliveries for the third quarter. That marked a turnaround after two consecutive quarterly declines to start the year.\"It's not just a retreat of everybody else, and Tesla gets to run away with the market,\" said Mark Wakefield, global automotive market lead at Alix Partners, in an interview.Consumer demand for fully electric vehicles had \"already kind of flatlined a bit\" even before the Republican spending bill, Wakefield added. Car buyers have been looking for a \"breakthrough moment\" where EVs would become cost competitive with hybrid or gas-powered models.Wakefield added that \"this market needs a sense of newness,\" and that the new, lower-priced Model Y and Model 3 options are not exactly \"earth shattering.\"The Trump administration isn't making life easy.Robbie Orvis, a senior director at Energy Innovation, a nonpartisan climate policy think tank, told CNBC the automakers' writedowns were expected and stem entirely from policy changes beyond just the tax credits.The Trump White House has also \"revoked California's waiver to set its own vehicle standards, revoked billions in funding for EV chargers and for auto plants to retool to build EVs, and is in the process of undoing vehicle tailpipe standards that would encourage the adoption of EVs,\" Orvis said.Those policies, along with tariffs, have already caused billions of dollars in losses for U.S. automakers, which means they aren't in a position to invest in new market segments, Orvis said.Tesla is experiencing its share of that pain, and it's showing up most acutely in international markets.\"Chinese automakers are rapidly displacing U.S. automakers in foreign markets as they are able to offer cheaper, higher-quality new cars, particularly EVs, in markets where there is large and growing demand for these cars,\" Orvis said.The Tesla Bot humanoid robot of Tesla ''Optimus'' is displayed at the 2023 World Artificial Intelligence Conference in Shanghai, China, July 6, 2023.Costfoto | Nurphoto | Getty ImagesMusk, meanwhile, continues to try and focus investor attention elsewhere.He insists the future of the company hinges on robotaxis and humanoid robotics, two markets that Tesla has yet to meaningfully crack. Tesla is testing its Robotaxi-branded service in limited capacity in some cities, but is way behind Alphabet's Waymo, which is rapidly expanding commercial operations.Musk said in March that Tesla aimed to make 5,000 of its Optimus robots this year, but key departures from the group have thrown that plan into question.In September, Musk wrote on X that \"~80% of Tesla's value will be Optimus.\" Last year, he predicted that Optimus robots would someday turn Tesla into a $25 trillion company, which was equal to more than half of the entire value of the S&P 500 at the time of his comment.It's a story that's compelling enough for some longtime Tesla bulls and Musk fanboys. But at the moment, the company still relies on sales of EVs to drive its business. And in the U.S., while Tesla's market share may be poised to rise, the overall pie — at least in the near term — appears to be shrinking.— CNBC's Mike Wayland contributed to this reportWATCH: Former Ford CEO says EV market didn't develop way automakers thoughtwatch now",

I think there's two vectors to it,\" Haas said. \"One is low power, the lowest power solution you can get in the cloud. Arm really contributes there. But I think even more specifically is moving those AI workloads away from the cloud to local applications.\"While he said AI training will likely always happen in the cloud, running AI, called inference, can happen locally — meaning on the chips inside people's phones, computers and glasses. History has shown \"we always go to hybrid models around computing,\" according to Haas.He suggested that hybrid dynamic will play out when it comes to AI, which will help alleviate huge power investments.Chip designer Arm's technology powers devices made by a number of major Big Tech players, including Microsoft and Amazon. Semiconductor giant Nvidia has a major stake in Arm and actually attempted to acquire the company in 2020.Arm and Meta on Wednesday said they would expand their partnership to \"scale AI efficiency across every layer of compute – spanning AI software and data center infrastructure,\" according to a press release. Arm stock saw gains following the announcement, finishing the day up 1.49%.Haas told Cramer that the partnership with Meta is \"largely around data centers, but more broadly...around software and the software stacks associated with it.\" He also discussed Arm's involvement in Meta's new Ray-Ban Wayfarer glasses, saying the AI for the technology is running both in the cloud and locally.\"For example, when you say, 'hey, Meta,' into those glasses, that's not happening on the cloud, that's actually happening in your glasses, and that's running on Arm,\" Haas said.Sign up now for the CNBC Investing Club to follow Jim Cramer's every move in the market.Disclaimer The CNBC Investing Club Charitable Trust owns shares of Meta, Microsoft, Amazon and Nvidia.Questions for Cramer?

The 11-inch iPad Pro starts at $999. The latest Apple Vision Pro, which includes a Dual Knit Band, starts at $3,499.The new devices are available to preorder now in most markets and go on sale Oct. 22. They are Apple's latest additions to its fall catalog of products.The company released the iPhone 17 and Apple Watch Series 11 models in September.Apple's December quarter is its largest by sales, driven by holiday and Christmas shopping. That is why the company usually updates its bestselling products in the fall. This year, it's the first full quarter of iPhone 17 sales as well.The new device lineup is powered by Apple's M5 chip, which the company said has four times the peak compute performance compared with the previous M4.Johny Srouji, Apple's senior vice president of Hardware Technologies, said in a release that the \"M5 delivers a huge boost to AI workloads.\"Supercharged by the powerful M5 chip, the new 14-inch MacBook Pro delivers even more performance and takes the next big leap in AI for the Mac.Courtesy: Apple Inc.Read more CNBC tech news$1 trillion-worth of AI deals between OpenAI, Nvidia and others, in one chartWaymo plans robotaxi launch in London, marking its European debutASML looks to calm fears over 2026 growth as it warns of China sales declineMeta removes Facebook page allegedly used to target ICE agents after pressure from DOJWednesday's announcement comes as Wall Street analysts are closely watching Apple's new releases to see if the company is raising prices or eating costs related to President Donald Trump's announced and threatened tariffs, especially on semiconductors and China.Starting prices for the latest M5 models are the same as the previous versions.While iPads and MacBooks aren't as critical for Apple as iPhone sales, they are still massive businesses.Apple reported $6.58 billion in iPad sales in the June quarter, an 8% decrease on an annual basis that the company attributed to difficult comparisons to the year-ago quarter when new iPad Pros were released.Mac sales in the June quarter came in at $8.05 billion, a 15% increase on a year-over-year basis. Apple released a new version of what it calls its bestselling laptop, the MacBook Air, earlier this year.Apple has never broken out figures for the Vision Pro headset but they are included alongside Apple Watch and AirPods sales in the company's wearables, or other products, line item. Analysts believe the company's Vision Pro revenue is negligible.MacBook, iPads and Vision Pro put together are significantly less than Apple's iPhone revenue, which accounted for more than 47% of revenue in the company's June quarter at just under $45 billion.Wall Street analysts tend to focus on iPhone sales and growth over the company's secondary product lines.The new iPad Pro with M5 unlocks the most advanced iPad experience ever, packing an incredible amount of power and AI performance into the ultraportable design.Courtesy: Apple Inc.watch now",

    "body": "UAE National Security Advisor, Sheikh Tahnoon bin Zayed Al Nahyan meets with U.S. President Donald Trump in the White House on March 18, 2025.Courtesy: Donald J. Trump | Via Truth SocialAs artificial intelligence startups raise increasingly large sums of cash to fund their swelling infrastructure needs, they're turning to strategic partners like Nvidia and big venture firms such as Thrive Capital, Sequoia and Andreessen Horowitz.But one major financier has a name that's less familiar in the world of tech investing: MGX.Backed by Abu Dhabi's sovereign wealth fund and launched in March 2024, MGX has emerged as a key source of capital as hyperscalers Microsoft, Meta and Google, and startups like OpenAI race to build out the enormous computing power needed to meet expected AI demand.In September, MGX made another big splash, joining Oracle and Silver Lake in President Donald Trump's push to get TikTok under U.S. control.And on Wednesday, MGX was back in the news as part of another giant AI deal. MGX is joining investors including Nvidia, Microsoft, BlackRock and Elon Musk's xAI in purchasing Aligned Data Centers for $40 billion, the largest global data center deal to date. Aligned designs and operates facilities across North and South America.MGX was formed out of a joint venture between Group 42 (G42), a tech holding company based in the United Arab Emirates, and Mubadala Investment Company. Despite the geopolitical concerns that come with bringing vast amounts of Middle Eastern money into critical U.S. infrastructure, tech companies are welcoming MGX and its deep pockets into the fold.MGX's first major announcement in the U.S. landed in the fall of 2024, not quite two years after OpenAI's ChatGPT set the generative AI boom in motion.In its initial deal, MGX joined a consortium — now called AI Infrastructure Partnership (AIP) — formed by firms including BlackRock and Microsoft, to spend $100 billion on AI infrastructure, primarily in the U.S. Separately, Microsoft invested $1.5 billion in G42 to develop AI technologies in the Middle East, with G42 using Microsoft's Azure cloud service to power it all.The AIP consortium is also MGX's avenue into the latest deal for Aligned.watch nowMGX has since joined as a partner in Stargate, the $500 billion Trump-endorsed joint venture with OpenAI, Oracle and SoftBank to build AI infrastructure across the U.S. According to PitchBook, MGX has also invested in numerous companies over the past year, including Databricks, Anthropic and xAI. Its chairman is Tahnoon bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the national security advisor of the UAE and a brother of the country's president.Certain transactions suggest a level of coziness with Trump.Earlier this year, MGX reportedly provided $2 billion in funding to the crypto exchange Binance, using a cryptocurrency purchased from the Trump family's World Liberty Financial. Al Nahyan also visited President Trump in the White House this spring to announce a $1.4 trillion investment in the U.S. over the next decade.'Backdoor deal'And then came TikTok.On Sept. 25, Trump signed an executive order backing a proposed deal to keep the social media app, owned by China's ByteDance, running in the U.S.ByteDance faced an ultimatum under a federal law, passed with bipartisan support from members of Congress, requiring it to either divest the platform's American business or be shut down in the U.S.As part of Trump's executive order, MGX joined with Oracle and Silver Lake to take a combined 45% of TikTok USA, though details still haven't been officially announced.Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., blasted the arrangement.\"MGX – a shady Abu Dhabi firm – has already cut deals to get sensitive American technology while enriching the Trump family's crypto firm,\" Warren said in a statement last month. \"The American people deserve to know if the President has struck another backdoor deal for this billionaire takeover of TikTok.\"Representatives for MGX, OpenAI, Microsoft and BlackRock declined to comment for this story.The steel frame of data centers under construction during a tour of the OpenAI data center in Abilene, Texas, U.S., Sept. 23, 2025. Shelby Tauber | ReutersPatrick Moorhead, an analyst at Moor Insights & Strategy, said tech companies in the U.S. may need to partner with Middle East firms on AI in order to keep them from instead working with our chief international adversary.\"I believe in the Middle East… we either provide the goods or they will go to China,\" Moorhead said.Moorhead added that MGX is following the same playbook as Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund. They're trying to diversify away from oil, and AI is one area where they can put money to work.\"The amount of capital required is astronomical,\" Moorhead said. \"And they're willing to take the risks.\"Even though tech giants like Microsoft, Meta and Amazon have enough cash to fund their AI ambitions, additional resources are always welcome. That's also why many AI leaders are renting AI capacity from companies like CoreWeave instead of building it all themselves.\"I think they will find real acceptance among VCs because people are comfortable with sovereign wealth,\" said Bradley Tusk, a venture capitalist and co-founder of Tusk Capital Partners. \"This is a tough fundraising environment, so they're a potentially good source of capital.\"Tusk warned that MGX could get entangled in U.S. politics and the perception that it's too close to the Trump administration, which could be problematic if a Democrat is in the White House in the coming years.\"I think the biggest risk is that the only narrative right now is they are Trump's friends,\" Tusk said.WATCH: Oracle, OpenAI and SoftBank unveil $400 billion Stargate data center expansion.watch now",

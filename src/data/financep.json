    "body": "There's no one right way to retire early. Some people manage to sell a business for a huge sum while others build passive income streams that allow them to leave their 9-to-5. Many adherents to the FIRE movement — short for financial independence, retire early — aim to save a large portion of their income in order to build a big enough investment portfolio to withdraw from in perpetuity. If you're hoping to follow that model, or even if you're aiming for a traditional retirement, new research indicates that you may be able to withdraw more from your portfolio each year — or build a smaller stash overall — than previously thought. For years, financial planners and early retirees alike have relied on the so-called \"4% rule\" as a guideline. The rule, which says it's generally safe to withdraw 4% of a balanced portfolio annually, adjusted for inflation, for a 30-year retirement was first described in a 1994 paper published in the Journal of Financial Planning by financial advisor Bill Bengen. Bengen's new book expands on his original research and, as a result, adjusts the safe withdrawal rate upward. For those still planning to take out 4% of their portfolio in retirement, \"I think they're cheating themselves a little bit,\" he tells CNBC Make It.Bengen's new default safe withdrawal rate for a 30-year retirement: 4.7%. And that number can go higher — even for early retirees — during periods of low to moderate inflation, he says.Arriving at the 4.7% ruleBengen arrived at his estimates through backward-looking data dating to 1926. Essentially, he says he wanted to find out what percentage of retirees' portfolios could be taken out each year, historically, with no one in his data set running out of money. Back in 1994, Bengen made a few assumptions. He assumed that historical investors had their savings in a tax-advantaged retirement account with 60% in U.S. large-company stocks and 40% in intermediate-term U.S. government bonds. He assumed the investor rebalanced to these allocations once per year. And he assumed that the investor would withdraw a certain percentage at the beginning of retirement and adjust the withdrawal for inflation, similar to the way Social Security does it, each following year. Putting those assumptions to work, he found that an initial withdrawal rate of 4.1%, adjusted for inflation thereafter, would see no historical investor run out of money over the course of a 30-year retirement. Thus, the 4% rule was born.Bengen made a few adjustments in his latest research to better reflect the asset mix that investors hold in retirement. He now assumes a portfolio with 55% in stocks, 45% in bonds and 5% in cash in the form of T-bills. Within that stock allocation, he includes large, midsize, small and micro-size company U.S. stocks, as well as some international exposure. The result: Under the historical worst-case scenario (one with high inflation and an unfavorable stock market) the investor can safely withdrawal 4.7% in retirement without running out of money for 30 years. For a 50-year retirement, it's closer to 4.2%. You may be able to safely withdraw even more, depending on conditions in the economy and stock market at the time you retire, Bengen finds. Your personal number may be higher, Bengen says, during periods when stocks aren't too richly valued and when inflation is at low to moderate levels. But you'll have to be vigilant — bear markets or periods of high inflation, especially at the outset of your retirement, could either force you to take more modest withdrawals or increase the risk that you'll run out of money, Bengen says. \"My research shows that if you endure a substantial bear market early in retirement, it drives down your withdrawal rates, because it sucks a lot out of the portfolio at the same time that you're drawing from it,\" Bengen says.The rate of inflation can also play a role in deciding how much to withdraw. Rapidly rising costs deplete the buying power of your savings, which, in turn, may force you to either withdraw more money or cut back on expenses — or both — in retirement, Bengen says. No two investors' withdrawal strategies will be exactly the same, and keeping tabs on these factors can be tricky, Bengen says. For those reasons, you'd be wise to discuss your retirement plans, early or otherwise, with a financial professional.And no matter what type of retirement you're planning for, it's smart to err on the conservative side with your planning, Bengen says. \"You don't know what the market or inflation could do. You don't know how long you'll live. [You] really don't know what your expenses will be like 30 years from now,\" he says.Want to give your kids the ultimate advantage? Sign up for CNBC's new online course, How to Raise Financially Smart Kids.

(Photo by Philip FONG / AFP) (Photo by PHILIP FONG/AFP via Getty Images)          Philip Fong | Afp | Getty ImagesJapan's consumer inflation rate dropped to 2.9% in November, staying above the 2% target set by the country's central bank for a 44th straight month, and further strengthening already strong prospects of a rate hike. Core inflation, which strips out prices of fresh food, remained unchanged from 3% in October, and came in line with Reuters-polled economists' average estimate.This data comes as the Bank of Japan is poised to raise rates to their highest level since 1995 as it concludes its 2-day policy meeting later in the day. The so-called \"core-core\" inflation rate, which excludes food and energy prices, fell to 3% from 3.1%. Rice inflation slowed for a sixth straight month, coming in at 37.1%. In May, rice prices had more than doubled year on year, marking the commodity's highest price growth in over 50 years.\"Core-core\" inflation will slow and stabilize at 2% by mid-2026 as supply-driven food inflation gradually fades, Shigeto Nagai, head of Japan economics at Oxford Economics, told CNBC.Nagai though warned that prolonged cost-push inflation due to additional supply shocks or yen depreciation poses a \"major risk.\" A rate hike by the BOJ will likely rein in inflation, bringing it closer to the bank's target. The BOJ, however, has to tread a fine line, as raising rates could crimp an already weak Japanese economy.Revised GDP numbers for the third quarter showed that Japan's economy shrank more than initially estimated, contracting 0.6% quarter on quarter, and 2.3% on an annualized basis. Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi reportedly said to a business lobby on Wednesday that Japan must pursue proactive spending, rather than excessive fiscal tightening in order to boost growth and tax revenues. She has also been a proponent of a looser monetary policy, and has been critical of BOJ's rate hikes. Bank of Japan Deputy Governor Masazumi Wakatabe told the same business lobby that the government must raise Japan's neutral rate of interest by boosting the economy's potential growth through fiscal spending and a growth strategy. The neutral rate refers to a policy rate that balances economic growth and inflation. \"If Japan's neutral rate rises as a result, it would be natural for the BOJ to raise interest rates,\" Wakatabe said, adding that \"The BOJ, however, must avoid raising rates prematurely or withdrawing monetary support too much.\"The BOJ does not have an official neutral rate forecast, with Governor Kazuo Ueda reportedly saying earlier this month that it was difficult to estimate the terminal rate, and the central bank pegging it at 1% to 2.5%. \"The yen could remain under pressure if fiscal concerns and the perception of an overly-dovish BOJ prevail over the impact of the yield gap,\" Nagai said. Japanese government bond yields have been hovering at multi-decade highs, narrowing the gap with their global counterparts.The yen strengthened marginally to trade at 155.53 against the dollar after the data release, while the benchmark Nikkei 225 gained 0.69%. Yield on 10-year JGBs was marginally lower at 1.957%.— CNBC's Asriel Chua contributed to this story.",

    "body": "Even with a lower-than-expected inflation reading Thursday, the cost of everyday goods and services remains much higher than it was at the start of the decade.Prices rose 2.7% over the past year, according to the consumer price index, which tracks changes in the cost of everyday items such as groceries, shelter, clothing, health care and transportation. While that marks a sharper-than-expected slowdown from October's 3% pace and brings inflation closer to the Federal Reserve's 2% target, it has remained above the Fed's goal since March 2021.The cumulative effect of those increases continues to strain household budgets, says Scott Anderson, chief U.S. economist at BMO Harris Bank.\"We're all comparing our grocery bills to what our money could buy in 2019 and not walking away with a warm and fuzzy feeling,\" Anderson tells CNBC Make It.Overall prices are up about 25% since January 2020, based on CPI data — more than double the roughly 10% cumulative inflation seen in the five years before that.Feeling the pinchWages have largely kept up with inflation since 2020 by most federal measures of income, according to a July 2025 report from Brookings. Still, not every worker has seen those gains, says Anderson.\"Wage gains tend to be higher for higher-skilled workers than lower-skilled workers, and in industries like financial services, information services and manufacturing sectors,\" he says.That uneven pattern may help explain why confidence remains weak, even with relatively low unemployment and steady overall wage growth.Consumer sentiment — a closely watched measure of household confidence — is near historic lows, based on a monthly University of Michigan survey. The survey asks households how their finances compare with a year ago, whether they expect their finances to improve in the year ahead and whether now is a good time to make major purchases. The latest index reading fell to 51 in November, a level last seen during the inflation surge of 2022, when the year-over-year inflation rate reached a peak of 9.1%.Similarly, a recent Bankrate survey found that 32% of Americans expect their finances to worsen in 2026, the highest level of pessimism since the annual survey began in 2018. Inflation stood out as the top concern, cited by nearly two-thirds of respondents — far more often than income, debt or interest rates.\"The cost of living still feels like it's rising for households who are now paying a lot more for food, electricity and housing than they were for several years before inflation shot up,\" says Atsi Sheth, chief credit officer at Moody's Ratings.Want to give your kids the ultimate advantage?

    "body": "The Eli Lilly & Co. logo at the company's Digital Health Innovation Hub facility in Singapore, on Thursday, Nov. 14, 2024.Ore Huiying | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesEli Lilly on Thursday said its closely watched obesity pill helped patients maintain the majority of their weight loss after they switched directly from taking the company's injection Zepbound and Novo Nordisk's rival shot Wegovy in a late-stage trial. The company also said it has filed for Food and Drug Administration approval of the daily GLP-1 pill, called orforglipron, for obesity. The FDA in November said it awarded a priority review voucher to that pill, which could expedite its review timeline to a few months. Shares of Eli Lilly rose more than 2% on Thursday after the announcement. The positive trial data suggests that the pill could be an effective treatment for patients to transition to if they want to preserve their weight loss but don't want to take weekly injections long term. Many people who stop those shots regain much of the weight they initially shed. While Eli Lilly's pill appears to cause less weight loss overall than existing injections, Thursday's results highlight its potential role as a needle-free maintenance treatment in the blockbuster GLP-1 market. But an oral pill for obesity from Novo Nordisk will likely enter the market first, giving the Danish drugmaker a head start in staking its claim in the space.The phase three trial followed more than 300 patients with obesity who previously took Wegovy or  Zepbound for 72 weeks in a separate late-stage study. Those people were then randomized to take either Eli Lilly's pill or a placebo for another 52 weeks. The oral drug met the trial's main goal of demonstrating superior weight loss maintenance compared with a placebo, among people who previously experienced a plateau in their progress while taking the injections. On average, patients who switched to the pill from Novo Nordisk's Wegovy only regained roughly 2 pounds of the weight they initially lost by the end of the trial. Meanwhile, on average, people who switched to the pill from Zepbound only regained around 11 pounds of the weight they initially lost by the end of the study. That means people in the Wegovy group maintained about 95% of their weight loss after switching, while those in the Zepbound group maintained roughly 80%. \"Obesity is a chronic, progressive disease, and sustaining weight loss remains a significant challenge for many,\" said Kenneth Custer, president of Lilly Cardiometabolic Health, in a release. He said the trial showed that the pill \"helped people maintain the weight they worked hard to lose\" and that, if approved, it could \"provide a convenient alternative for the millions of individuals living with obesity around the globe to continue their long-term health journey.\"While people in the Zepbound group appeared to regain more weight, the bigger focus is likely on those who transitioned from the drug's top competitor, Wegovy. In an October note, BMO Capital Markets analyst Evan Seigerman said positive results from the trial could give Eli Lilly \"the unique opportunity to capture revenue share\" from chronic treatment with semaglutide, the active ingredient in Novo Nordisk's Wegovy and diabetes injection Ozempic. \"Chipping away at the potential for Novo's flagship product,\" Seigerman wrote. In a note on Thursday, Leerink Partners analyst David Risinger said the data \"will help drive commercial success and upside to consensus expectations\" for Eli Lilly's pill. He said the firm expects the drug to rake in $2 billion in sales by the end of 2026, $9 billion by the end of 2027 and $16 billion by the end of 2028. Dr. Caroline Apovian, co-director of the Center for Weight Management and Wellness at Brigham and Women's Hospital, said the results were \"still great\" even though patients regained some of the weight they lost. But she said, \"in order for this to be a good switch, these orals are going to have to be less expensive for the insurance companies to cover than the injectables, right?\" Obesity injections currently carry list prices of roughly $1,000 per month before insurance, though both Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk have cut the direct-to-consumer prices of their drugs for cash-paying patients. It's unclear how the companies will price their respective pills. But under recent deals with President Donald Trump, the companies said starting doses of their upcoming oral drugs, pending approvals, will be $149 per month for everyone getting them through the direct-to-consumer website TrumpRx. That site launches in January. The overall safety and tolerability – or how well patients handle treatment – of the pill were consistent with previous late-stage studies. The most common side effects were gastrointestinal related and generally mild to moderate in severity. More CNBC health coverageThe Trump administration is changing Covid, childhood vaccine recommendations – here's what it means for youU.S. to impose 100% tariff on branded, patented drugs unless firms build plants locally, Trump saysEli Lilly to build $6.5 billion Texas manufacturing facility for obesity pill, other drugsAround 4.8% of people who switched to the pill from Wegovy discontinued treatment due to side effects, while 7.2% of those who switched to the oral drug from Zepbound did the same. Meanwhile, those rates were 7.6% and 6.3% among patients who switched to a placebo from Wegovy and Zepbound, respectively. No liver safety issues were observed, according to Eli Lilly. Full results of the trial, called ATTAIN-MAINTAIN, will be presented at an upcoming medical meeting and published in a peer-reviewed journal next year. Eli Lilly's pill works in a similar way to Wegovy, Ozempic and Novo Nordisk's diabetes pill Rybelsus, targeting a gut hormone called GLP-1 to suppress a person's appetite and regulate blood sugar. Novo Nordisk is also seeking approval of an oral version of Wegovy for obesity, which could come by year-end.But unlike those three treatments, Eli Lilly's pill is not a peptide medication. That means it is absorbed more easily by the body and does not require dietary restrictions like Rybelsus or oral Wegovy does.In a note in August, Goldman Sachs analysts forecast that pills will capture a 24% share — or around $22 billion — of the 2030 global weight loss drug market, which they expect to be worth $95 billion in total.They said they expect Eli Lilly's pill to have a 60% share — or roughly $13.6 billion — of the daily oral segment of the market in 2030. They expect Novo Nordisk's oral semaglutide to have a 21% share — or around $4 billion — of that segment.",

Last week, Lululemon announced CEO Calvin McDonald would step down effective Jan. 31, following a year-long performance slump for Lululemon. Elliott has been working with former Ralph Lauren CFO and COO Jane Nielsen as a potential candidate, according to the person, who spoke on the condition of anonymity about confidential matters.In a news release announcing McDonald's departure, the company said its board of directors was working with a \"leading executive search firm\" to find its next CEO. The leadership change came as Lululemon's founder Chip Wilson has been calling on the company to make a change, saying earlier this year that the company's performance is \"in a nosedive.\"The athletic apparel company has been facing an increasingly crowded landscape, with athleisure entrants like Vuori and Alo Yoga. Nielsen served at Ralph Lauren from 2016 until April. Before that, she held roles at Coach and PepsiCo. Elliott has taken a stake in a slate of other companies as well this year, including a more than $2 billion stake in Workday and a $4 billion stake in PepsiCo. The Wall Street Journal earlier reported Elliott's Lululemon stake. ",

Trump, and likewise, congratulations to President Kennedy, because this will be a truly great team long into the future! The building will no doubt attain new levels of success and grandeur,\" she said.The move may face challenges, however: U.S. code states that no new \"memorials or plaques in the nature of memorials shall be designated or installed in the public areas of the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts.\"To change that would require Congress, NBC News reported in July. House Republicans have already introduced at least one bill to rename the center in Trump's honor.\"The Kennedy Center is a living memorial to a fallen president and named for President Kennedy by federal law,\" said former Democratic Rep. Joe Kennedy III, a grandnephew of former President Kennedy, on X. \"It can no sooner be renamed than can someone rename the Lincoln Memorial, no matter what anyone says,\" he wrote.Leavitt's depiction of a center that has been saved \"not only from the standpoint of its reconstruction, but also financially, and its reputation\" contrasts with reporting from multiple news outlets that ticket sales and staffing both have sharply declined this year.The New York Times reported last month that internal figures showed ticket sales during a typical week in October down by about 50% from the same period a year earlier.The Washington Post, which analyzed sales data from early September through Oct. 19, found an \"across-the-board drop-off\" in ticket sales for the center's three largest performance spaces.Weeks after taking office, Trump named himself chairman of the Kennedy Center and terminated a slew of existing board members, saying they \"do not share our Vision for a Golden Age in Arts and Culture.\"He signaled in October that the name change was forthcoming.In a Truth Social post, Trump shared pictures of a newly painted colonnade on the outside of the building below a caption praising \"the new TRUMP KENNEDY, whoops, I mean, KENNEDY CENTER, columns.\"He nevertheless said later Thursday that he was \"surprised\" by the board's decision.\"I was honored by it. You know, we're saving the building,\" he told reporters in the Oval Office.The center was not initially named after Kennedy.It was created in 1958, when President Dwight Eisenhower signed legislation to \"provide for a National Cultural Center\" in Washington.In 1962, Eisenhower's successor, Kennedy, and first lady Jacqueline Kennedy led a $30 million fundraising campaign to build the center.Kennedy was assassinated in November 1963. Two months later, President Lyndon Johnson signed a law renaming the center in honor of the slain president.Trump has used the Kennedy Center extensively during the first year of his second presidential term.He attended a board meeting there in March, claiming the building was in \"tremendous disrepair.\" In June, he and first lady Melania Trump appeared for the opening night of the musical \"Les Miserables.\"This month, Trump took the unusual step of hosting the Kennedy Center Honors, where actors Sylvester Stallone and Michael Crawford, and musicians including Gloria Gaynor, George Strait and the members of '80s rock band Kiss, were saluted.Trump also attended the FIFA World Cup drawing at the center, where he was awarded the soccer organization's newly created \"peace prize.\"",

    "body": "An Olive Garden restaurant in Milpitas, California, US, on Tuesday, Dec. 16, 2025. David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesDarden Restaurants on Thursday reported strong sales growth, fueled by demand at Olive Garden and LongHorn Steakhouse as thrifty diners look for good deals.For the second straight quarter, the company hiked its full-year outlook for revenue growth, although it only reiterated its projections for its earnings. \"The second quarter exceeded our top-line expectations as every segment delivered positive same-restaurant sales,\" Darden CEO Rick Cardenas said in a statement.Shares of the company rose nearly 3% in morning trading.Here's what the company reported compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:Earnings per share: $2.08 adjusted vs. $2.10 expectedRevenue: $3.1 billion vs. $3.07 billion expectedDarden reported fiscal second-quarter net income of $237.2 million, or $2.03 per share, up from $215.1 million, or $1.82 per share, a year earlier. Higher ingredient costs, particularly for near-record prices for beef, weighed on the company's restaurant-level margin, CFO Raj Vennam said on the company's conference call.Excluding restaurant closure costs and expenses related to its acquisition of Chuy's, the restaurant company earned $2.08 per share.Net sales rose 7.3% to $3.1 billion.Darden's same-store sales increased 4.3% in the quarter, topping Wall Street estimates of 3%, according to StreetAccount. While the broader restaurant industry has seen sluggish sales growth, Darden has found success by raising its menu prices by less than inflation and adding promotions aimed at diners looking for value.\"Weaker consumer sentiment doesn't necessarily translate into reduced spending during the quarter,\" Cardenas said during the conference call. He said the company saw high-income consumers trade into its casual-dining chains, although demand from diners making less than $50,000 fell slightly. Darden also got a traffic bump from consumers who are at least 55 years old.Restaurant resultsOlive Garden, which accounted for roughly 44% of Darden's quarterly sales, reported same-store sales growth of 4.7%. Executives credited the popularity of the Italian chain's $13.99 Never Ending Pasta Bowl promotion that ran during the quarter, plus Olive Garden's growing delivery business. In an appeal to inflation-weary consumers, Olive Garden is also adding the option of smaller portions at a lower price for select menu items. Cardenas said the change is improving its value perception among some diners. About 40% of the chain's locations offered the lighter portions menu during the quarter, and another 20% added it early in the fiscal third quarter. LongHorn Steakhouse saw same-store sales growth of 5.9%. While Olive Garden still outnumbers LongHorn based on its restaurant footprint, the steakhouse chain's sales are growing faster. Cardenas said LongHorn saw higher traffic from consumers who make less than $50,000, despite the chain's higher average check relative to Olive Garden. He credited higher beef prices, which mean that a steak at LongHorn could be the same price or cheaper than buying one from the grocery store.watch nowThe company's other business segment reported same-store sales growth of 3.1%, fueled by strong demand at Yard House, according to Cardenas.Darden's fine-dining business, which includes Ruth's Chris and The Capital Grille, saw same-store sales growth of 0.8%, bucking the malaise of the sector. The broader fine-dining segment has struggled as consumers spend less when dining out and many companies have cut back on business lunches and other expenses. Darden tried to appeal to those budget-conscious diners by bringing back a deal at Ruth's Chris for a three-course meal priced at $55 per person. \"It's a profitable deal for us,\" Cardenas said.For fiscal 2026, Darden now expects total sales growth of 8.5% to 9.3%, up from its prior forecast of 7.5% to 8.5%. The fiscal year includes a 53rd week, which is expected to contribute about 2%. Darden also adjusted its expectations for inflation to 3.5%, on the high end of its prior range of 3% to 3.5%. Higher costs will weigh on the company's margins, leading the company to reiterate its forecast for adjusted earnings in a range of $10.50 to $10.70 per share.",

    "body": "Traders work on the floor at the New York Stock Exchange in New York City, U.S., Dec. 17, 2025.  Brendan McDermid | ReutersWall Street could be in for a volatile end to the week as traders brace for what Goldman Sachs says will be the largest options expiration on record.Options expiration days are a monthly occurrence on Wall Street when the contracts on short-term derivatives expire. Friday happens to be one of the rare times (four times a year) when options on four types of securities expire on the same day: index options, single stock options, index futures and index futures options. This is called a \"quadruple witching\" day.More than $7.1 trillion in notional options exposure is set to expire this Friday, according to Goldman, including roughly $5 trillion tied to the S&P 500 index and $880 billion linked to single stocks. December options expirations are typically the biggest of the year, but this one eclipses all prior records, the firm said.To put the scale into context, the options expiring Friday represent notional exposure equal to about 10.2% of the total market capitalization of the Russell 3000, Goldman said.That dynamic could lead to choppy trading, particularly around heavily watched levels in the S&P 500, according to Jeff Kilburg, founder and CEO of KKM Financial.\"I am expecting volumes to be well above normal as options traders finalize 2025 profits and losses,\" Kilburg said. \"But a lot of the repositioning seems to have already taken place. 6800 is a big strike price in the S&P and we will see if the bulls can defend that level after pushing the market back above it this morning.\"The S&P 500 is up about 15% this year, trading around 6,770 on Thursday. Stock Chart IconStock chart iconS&P 500 YTDWhile the broader market could have heightened volumes and volatility, some individual stocks with large open interest could see a different scenario. If options traders who hedge their positions are sitting on a large amount of at-the-money options, the activity tied to those contracts expiring can actually calm price swings rather than intensify them. Options that are \"at the money\" have strike prices that are equal to the current price of the underlying asset.As traders adjust their hedges, prices can get pulled toward heavily traded strike levels, a phenomenon known as a \"pin,\" leaving stocks hovering near key levels into the close, Goldman noted.\"This situation is often referred to as a 'pin' and can be an ideal situation for a large investor trying to enter/exit a stock position,\" Goldman said.Stocks with options expiring Friday that represent a large share of their typical daily trading volume — and could be prone to \"pinning\" — include GeneDx Holdings, BILL Holdings, Avis Budget Group and GameStop, the firm found.",

Now we're the hottest country anywhere in the world,\" Trump said.US President Donald Trump addresses the nation from the Diplomatic Reception Room of the White House in Washington, DC, on December 17, 2025. Doug Mills | Afp | Getty ImagesThe address came as Trump's approval ratings are sagging across the board, on issues ranging from immigration to inflation, and as Republicans seek to hold on to majorities in the House and Senate in the 2026 midterm elections.\"We're bringing our economy back from the brink of ruin,\" Trump said during the address.But the economy, once a selling point for the president, has become a vulnerability as his sweeping tariffs have caused uncertainty and led to increased costs for some consumers and businesses.Trump recently called growing concerns about affordability a \"Democratic hoax\" and, in a Politico podcast this month, gave the economy a grade of \"A plus plus plus plus plus.\"Meanwhile, according to CNBC's All-America Economic Survey, 66% of Americans polled this month disapproved of Trump's handling of inflation, which is ticking up. In April, his disapproval rate on inflation was at 60%. Trump's economic approval rating is 36% and his overall approval rating is just 38%, according to a Marist poll released Wednesday.Democrats have sought to hammer Trump on the economy.A group of Senate Democrats on Wednesday held a news conference on affordability.\"Costs are skyrocketing, and Democrats in 2026, you'll be hearing from us about costs over and over and over again,\" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said. \"On the contrary, Donald Trump tonight is going to try to talk about his accomplishments, but it's going to be a very short speech.\"Read more CNBC politics coverageTrump sues BBC for $10 billion, claims defamation from Panorama documentaryPentagon takes big stake in new Korea Zinc refinery in Tenn., gets 10% of companyNew Trump tariffs collection hits $200 billion, Customs saysFormer Instacart employee says she was fired over her Democratic congressional campaignUkraine peace talks progressing, Russia open to EU membership, U.S. officials sayNew York AG sues UPS for allegedly shorting Christmas season workers' wagesTrump admin to hire 1,000 specialists for 'Tech Force'Trump doubles down on Rob Reiner criticism after killing; director's son in custodyTSA is giving airline passenger data to ICE for deportation push: NYTTrump's AI order may be 'illegal,' Democrats and consumer advocacy groups claimTrump sued by preservation group seeking to halt White House ballroom projectTrump says 'no big deal' after new Epstein photos showing him releasedPutin can fund war for years, ex-official says as Trump's resolve is testedIndiana redistricting bill that Trump demanded defeated in state SenateHouse passes INVEST Act to ease investment standards, boost capital in marketsDOJ fails again to indict New York AG James, a Trump target: ReportsTrump 'sells out' U.S. national security with Nvidia chip sales to China: WarrenTrump pushes for top prosecutor nominee Halligan after Comey, James cases tossedTrump willing to seize more oil tankers off Venezuela coast: White HouseSeized tanker will go to U.S. port, Trump admin intends 'to seize the oil'GOP lawmakers seek Trump aid for agricultural equipment after tariff pressureTrump says Fed could have 'at least doubled' latest interest rate cut'Spoof' ship: Seized oil tanker hid location, visited Iran and VenezuelaTrump admin touts pulling 9,500 truckers off road for failing English testsSwiss government says new 15% U.S. tariff ceiling retroactive to mid-NovemberHomeland Security Dept. buying Boeing 737s for ICE deportationsTrump officials move to end student loan payment pause for millions of borrowersJudge unseals Ghislaine Maxwell grand jury materials, citing Epstein files actUkraine at 'critical moment' in war as European allies ramp up pressure on RussiaDemocrats establish AI working group as industry bolsters DC presenceEx-Trump lawyer Habba resigns as NJ U.S. attorney after disqualificationDuring the address, Trump projected \"the largest tax refund season of all time\" thanks to the tax and spending package he signed into law over the summer.The president also highlighted his foreign policy successes, making the questionable claim that he has ended eight wars since taking office and pointing to his aggressive posture toward Venezuela.\"Drugs brought in by ocean and by sea are now down 94%,\" Trump said.Beginning in September, the Trump administration began striking alleged drug boats in the eastern Pacific and the Caribbean. Trump claimed in October without evidence that each of the boats is \"responsible for the death of 25,000 American people, and the destruction of families.\" As Trump's speech was about to begin, the U.S. Southern Command announced on X that it had conducted a strike on a vessel in the eastern Pacific that was \"engaged in narco-trafficking operations.\" Four men aboard the boat were killed, the U.S. Southern Command said.According to the Government Accountability Office, fentanyl is the primary cause of overdose deaths in the U.S. and mostly comes from China and Mexico through the southern border. On Tuesday, Trump designated the Venezuelan government a \"terrorist\" organization and ordered a \"complete and total\" blockade of sanctioned oil tankers moving in and out of the country. He told Politico last week that he would not rule out a ground invasion of Venezuela.\"We have the most powerful military anywhere in the world and it's not even close.

    "body": "A shopper carries Nike bags in San Francisco, California, US, on Wednesday, Dec. 17, 2025.  David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesNike on Thursday posted quarterly earnings and revenue that topped Wall Street's estimates, as strength in North America helped to offset a plunge in China sales.The company's stock slid about 10% in extended trading Thursday, as investors digested the weakness in China and the sustained hit Nike is taking from higher tariffs.Here's what Nike reported for its second fiscal quarter of 2026, according to consensus estimates from LSEG:Earnings per share: 53 cents vs. 38 cents expectedRevenue: $12.43 billion vs. $12.22 billion expectedThe athletic apparel retailer said sales in North America rose 9% to $5.63 billion. But revenue in its Greater China market dropped 17% to $1.42 billion.The sneaker company is just over a year into CEO Elliott Hill's turnaround strategy, focusing on regaining its growth and market share, clearing out old inventory and investing in wholesale relationships.\"Fiscal year '26 continues to be a year of taking action to rightsize our classics business, return Nike digital to a premium experience, diversify our product portfolio, deepen our consumer connection, strengthen our partner relationships and realign our teams and leadership,\" Hill said on a call with analysts. \"And I say we're in the middle inning of our comeback.\"\"We're nowhere near our potential,\" he added.Hill said Nike's improvements in its China market are \"not happening at the level or the pace we need to drive wider change,\" though he said the country remains one of the company's most powerful long-term opportunities.Nike expects fiscal third quarter revenues to fall by a low single digit percentage, with modest growth in North America. It also anticipates gross margins will drop 1.75 to 2.25 percentage points – including a 3.15 percentage point hit from tariffs.The company said wholesale revenues climbed 8% to $7.5 billion during the quarter. But direct sales — which were a focus for Nike in the years before Hill took over and moved away from the strategy — fell 8% to $4.6 billion.Nike has also been feeling the impact of tariff increases. It said Thursday that its gross margin decreased by 3 percentage points and inventories dropped 3% primarily due to higher tariffs.watch nowThe sneaker company has been reporting weakness in its Converse brand, too. In its first fiscal quarter, Nike said Converse sales dropped 27% – on Thursday, it reported a 30% drop in revenues for the sneaker brand. Despite the weakness in some parts of Nike's business, the company highlighted some areas of strength and new initiatives ahead. CFO Matt Friend said on the call that Nike.com posted its best Black Friday ever this year, partially driven by its Air Jordan \"Black Cat\" launch.Nike also plans to launch a new footwear platform in January called Nike Mind, which aims to help athletes prepare for performance and competition, Hill said on the call.Nike has been making larger internal changes under Hill.Earlier this month, Nike underwent leadership changes to \"remove layers,\" according to Hill. Under its \"Win Now\" strategy, the company announced that Chief Commercial Officer Craig Williams would leave the sneaker giant. Hill called the shakeup a move \"about growth and offense.\"\"Collectively, these changes amount to us eliminating layers and better positioning Nike to continue to have an impact the way only Nike can,\" Hill said in a statement at the time.Nike shares have dropped more than 13% this year as of Thursday's close.",

    "body": "Cat Goetze has built her career in tech, but says even she's made an effort to reduce her phone screen time.The LA-based zillennial tech entrepreneur says earlier in her career, she felt she was on her phone too much and decided to make a concerted effort to curb the habit. She ended up going \"off of social media almost entirely for five years.\"\"I was screen-time sober, so to speak,\" Goetze tells CNBC Make It.Her quest to reduce her screen time led her to create Physical Phones, a landline-style phone that connects to smartphones via Bluetooth to place and receive calls. Goetze launched the business over the summer and sold $120,000 of them within three days, according to documents reviewed by Make It.Goetze says she's no longer fully off social media now that she creates online content for her brand as a tech founder, but she still makes an effort to stay off as much as possible. Aside from using her own product, Goetze says these five tips have helped her keep her screen time to a minimum:1. She changed her phone display to black and whiteThe first time Goetze went \"screen-time sober,\" she says she didn't feel compelled to keep up with the latest tech. She had an older device, an iPhone 8, at the time, which had fewer bells and whistles — or distractions — to keep her on her phone.She also adjusted her display settings so her screen was in black and white, which some users says makes your phone less fun to look at and therefore less distracting.\"It was super low stimulus,\" Goetze says, which kept her from endlessly scrolling on social media apps.2. She doesn't check her phone for the first 30 minutes of each dayGoetze says she avoids looking at her phone for the first 30 minutes of each morning during the week, and up to an hour on weekends. That means using a real alarm clock to wake up.She finds that starting her day phone-free drastically reduces the amount of times she reaches for it for the remainder of the day.\"How you start your day kind of sets the tone subconsciously for the rest of the day,\" she says. Now, she focuses on small morning routines, like brushing her teeth, journaling and feeding her cat.\"I'm busy enough as it is,\" Goetze says. \"I don't even realize the 30 minutes go by, and then I end up picking up my phone like a ton less.\"3. She leaves her phone at homeGoetze says the biggest milestone she hit was going the entire day without checking her phone.She'd accomplish that by leaving it at home while she was out running errands.\"I would literally not even bring my phone if I left the house,\" she says, \"like leaving it to go to the gym, and then I would go to the grocery [store], and then I would go to one more place and then come home. It would end up being half the day, or almost the entire day.\"4. She asks whether checking her phone is really urgentGoetze says that when she's at home and feels the urge to check her phone, she'll ask herself: \"Is there anything that is truly so urgent that it cannot wait until the next time I'm at my computer, which is usually within 15 minutes?\"That thought process is usually enough to keep her from pulling out her phone until she can dedicate time to knock out a few digital to-dos at once while back at her desk.If she's out somewhere and checks her phone, she'll again pause and consider whether she really needs to respond to a message or complete a task in that moment.\"I'll ask myself, will it make a difference if I send this message now, or later when I'm not doing something else — like when I'm actually sitting down and spending intentional time to respond to messages,\" she says.For example, she was recently waiting in line at a coffee shop when she read an email on her phone from her overseas Physical Phones manufacturer.She thought about responding in the moment, but paused and realized it was the middle of the night for them anyway, so her reply could wait. That ends up being the case in most instances, she says.5. She understands smartphones are built to maximize engagement.Goetze says one of the hardest parts of reducing her reliance on her phone is giving herself grace and knowing that it can be a difficult habit to break.\"There's a natural tendency to take on a lot of responsibility and be like, 'This is my fault. My screen time sucks. I have ADHD. I'm stupid; I'm bad; I'm I can't pay attention to stuff,'\" she says.As someone who studied science, technology, media and communication at Stanford, Goetze says she reminds herself that her screen time habits are linked to how companies design their devices and social media apps to be engaging.Stanford psychiatrist Anna Lembke has done research showing that using social media apps can cause the release of dopamine among users, leading them to want to keep using the platforms — even more so when AI-powered algorithms learn what they want to see or respond to most.From Goetze's perspective, \"this is not about willpower,\" she says, but rather about \"putting external things in place that combat the forces that are already underway,\" like turning your phone screen to black and white, or physically leaving it out of your bedroom at night.Want to give your kids the ultimate advantage? You teach them to read and ride a bike, but often skip money management.

These seven provisions reduced individual income taxes by $144 billion in 2025, according to Tax Foundation estimates. However, the IRS did not adjust withholding tables, which tell employers how much to take from worker paychecks.\"Instead of gradually receiving the benefit of the tax cuts through higher take-home pay during the year, most taxpayers will receive it all at once when they file their returns,\" York wrote.watch nowWho could see a bigger refundYour 2026 tax refund could depend on which provisions affect your individual situation, experts say. The higher standard deduction, bigger child tax credit and senior tax break will have an impact on many taxpayers, whereas other provisions, such as deductions on tip and overtime income, affect smaller groups of filers.For many, Trump's legislation was an extension of the tax breaks enacted in 2017, Alex Muresianu, a senior policy analyst at the Tax Foundation, previously told CNBC. \"The basic structure of it is going to be very much the same tax code that you've been used to for the past eight years,\" he said.A note released by Piper Sandler on Oct. 31 also predicted \"an exceptionally large refund season,\" with middle- and upper-income taxpayers likely to benefit the most.   As of Oct. 17, the average refund for individual returns was $3,052 during the 2025 filing season, up slightly from $3,004 in 2024, according to the latest IRS data.  ",

    "body": "Chipotle will debut a High Protein Menu on Tuesday, December 23, with items ranging from 15 to 81 grams of protein per item.Source: Chipotle Mexican GrillChipotle Mexican Grill is entering the snack business.The fast-casual giant announced Thursday it will roll out its first-ever \"High Protein Menu\" later this month, featuring grab-and-go protein cups. Starting Tuesday, customers in the U.S. and Canada can buy a 4-ounce portion filled with adobo chicken or steak.The move is designed to re-energize demand as the chain known for massive burritos and bowls is grappling with slowing sales growth and a fundamental shift in how Americans eat.\"For years, guests have used Chipotle's customizable offerings to build high protein and fiber-filled meals on their own,\" Chris Brandt, Chipotle's president and chief brand officer, said in a release.The company recently cut its full-year same-store sales forecast for the third consecutive quarter, triggering a nearly 20% single-day stock selloff. Multiple Wall Street firms lowered their price targets, citing weakening traffic, most sharply among customers ages 25 to 35, and fading visibility into a rebound.Chipotle stock is down around 38% year-to-date. Across the fast-casual sector, inflation-weary consumers have been pulling back on dining out, and analysts have told CNBC previously that Chipotle is battling a value perception problem, with some diners lumping the chain in with pricier fast-casual rivals despite average entree prices that are closer to $10.Beyond the protein cup, the High Protein Menu includes entrees such as the Double High Protein Bowl and the High Protein-High Fiber Bowl, with items ranging from 15 to 81 grams of protein per serving. \"This curated menu brings that fan behavior to the forefront with clean ingredients and flexible portions, making protein and other dietary goals easier to reach in just a few taps,\" Brandt said. watch nowSmaller, protein-dense portions allow Chipotle to compete not just with other restaurants, but with protein bars, shakes and convenience-store snacks, while potentially capturing visits outside of lunch and dinner.High-protein diets have ranked as the top diet pattern in the U.S. for three consecutive years, according to Chipotle. About 70% of Americans now say they prioritize protein, and more than one-third have increased their intake over the past year, according to the International Food Information Council.  The launch also comes against the backdrop of a dramatic shift in consumer behavior driven by GLP-1 weight-loss drugs and growing interest in macronutrient tracking. GLP-1 users, in particular, tend to eat smaller amounts while emphasizing protein to preserve muscle mass — a trend that is forcing restaurant chains to rethink portion sizes, menu structure and pricing.Chipotle isn't alone in pivoting toward protein-forward offerings. Fast-casual salad chain Sweetgreen recently introduced new menu items following the trend, headlined by a bowl with 106 grams of protein. ",

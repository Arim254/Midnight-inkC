Experts typically recommend a couple considerations before taking that risk.Those considerations include a strong business plan — clearly stating what the product or service is, who'll buy it and the money you'll be making — and enough money to sustain yourself as you establish your business, according to Kevin Lao, a certified financial planner and founder of advising firm Imagine Financial Security. Lao saved up a year's worth of living expenses and three months of business expenses before launching his firm, he told CNBC in January 2022. And he was clear on his company's vision, he added.\"It's very hard to be successful if you don't have a very compelling 'why,'\" Lao said.For John, his waiter job — though it wasn't glamorous — set the foundation for his approach to entrepreneurship and taught him an important lesson, he wrote.\"People don't realize it, but sometimes the day job is your first investor,\" John wrote. \"Don't get discouraged if you don't have the means to quit your job right away.

    "body": "If enacted, President Donald Trump's proposal for a temporary 10% cap on credit card interest rates could change many policies for borrowers. Among them: how issuers decide to value credit card points.  If you've accumulated any significant amount of credit card points, you should probably spend them now — but not because of the potential for a 10% interest rate cap, says Nick Ewen, senior editorial director at The Points Guy.\"This is not a reason in and of itself to spend your points,\" Ewen says. \"Even before this was announced, you should be spending your points.\"Credit card points — rewards earned from card spend that can be redeemed for benefits like travel, cash back or merchandise — are funded mainly by fees paid by merchants on each transaction, along with interest and sometimes fees paid by cardholders, Ewen says.That means a 10% interest rate cap could reduce issuer revenue. To offset that lost income, reward programs may lower the amount of points you can earn from spending on the card, increase redemption costs or offer fewer perks, Ewen says.However, putting a timeline on when points could start to lose their value if an interest rate cap is implemented is a \"fool's errand,\" because of all the uncertainty around Trump's proposal, he says. Why you should spend your credit card points nowThere are two main reasons you should be consistently spending your points, Ewen says:Credit issuers can change their policiesPoints tend to lose value over timeHotel, airline and credit card reward programs can change their redemption policies at will, and they don't necessarily need to give you advance notice of any upcoming changes, Ewen says.\"You don't know what the future is going to hold,\" Ewen says. Stockpiling points \"can really come back to bite you if something changes significantly in the program that you are holding them in.\"Changes rarely increase the value you can redeem for your points, Ewen says. Whether it's beneficial redemption rates or options to transfer your points to airlines or hotel loyalty programs, if your credit card comes with a perk you have active plans to use, Ewen says it may be wise to take advantage now.Additionally, unlike money you put in a high-yield savings or investment account, your points don't earn interest. This means their real value erodes over time as prices rise — $100 worth of points with an airline will still be worth $100 next year, even if flight prices increase, Ewen says. \"The idea of using your points now keeps money in your pocket to be used in other situations,\" Ewen says. \"Sure, you can earn more through spending and other activities, but you're not going to see a balance increase just by leaving it there.\"How many points is too many points?The number of points you should keep on hand will vary by person, and it largely depends on how many opportunities you have to redeem them, Ewen says. It can be useful to have some points saved for emergency situations like last-minute flights, he adds.For those going on multiple domestic and international trips in a year, it may make sense to hold onto more points. Those who travel less frequently should start thinking about spending their points once they hit the mid to upper five-figure range, he says.It's very common to see people saving points for a big trip like a honeymoon, Ewen says. Keep in mind that points can often be redeemed months ahead of time, and if price drops happen, especially with flights, you may be able to rebook and receive the difference back in points, though you should check with your provider first, Ewen says.If you have points that can cover a flight right now, go ahead and spend your points on it, he says: \"That is going to be your best option.\"Want to get ahead at work with AI?

    "body": "There's no way to walk through New York City's Flatiron district without seeing The Flatiron Building. It first opened in 1902 and has been part of the city's fabric ever since. And for the first time in 124 years, if you have the money, you can call it home.Formerly a commercial building, the Flatiron Building is being converted into 38 luxury condominiums, with a full completion scheduled for later this year. Apartments in the building range from three-bedroom units selling for around $10.95 million to the penthouse on the 21st floor going for over $50 million. Corcoran Sunshine is leading sales and marketing for all of the apartments, which were designed by Studio Sofield. \"Very few buildings in the world elicit an emotional response like The Flatiron Building and reimagining this iconic landmark as residential homes has been an exciting and deeply meaningful experience; one we approach with great care and respect,\" William Sofield, designer and founder of Studio Sofield, tells CNBC Make It via email. There are currently two four-bedroom, four-bathroom units available, priced from $16 million to $18.9 million. Others are set to become available later this year, with three-quarters of the building expected to be done by July. The 11th floor apartment spans 3,828 square feet and occupies two corners of the building.Courtesy of The Flatiron BuildingThe first is an 11th-floor unit that went on the market on Jan. 24 for $16 million. It spans 3,828 square feet and occupies two corners of the building, offering south, east and west exposures. The standout feature is the great room, measuring 58 feet by 21 feet, with 10-foot ceilings. \"You're in a historic building looking at historic facades. It gets tremendous light because it's southwest facing,\" James Lansill, senior managing director at Corcoran Sunshine Marketing Group, tells CNBC Make It. The second apartment is on the sixth floor and listed for $18.9 million. It spans 4,654 square feet with a great room measuring more than 63 feet by 26 feet. It also has an additional half bathroom. The unit offers views of Madison Square Park, up to Fifth Avenue and Broadway.One of the facing points of the apartment has views of Madison Square Park.Courtesy of The Flatiron BuildingLansill says the Flatiron Building apartments are special because each unit has subtle differences from its peers. \"Each one has a personality and that personality can be informed by the historical trim that surrounds the outside of the window,\" he says. \"What was modern about The Flatiron Building in 1902 is still what's modern about it today. The reimagined interiors reflect a love of craftsmanship, texture, and history. We carefully considered what kind of design would best honor the site's integrity and its place within the city,\" Sofield says. The sixth floor apartment spans 4,654 square feet with a great room measuring over 63 feet by 26 feet.Courtesy of The Flatiron BuildingThe Flatiron Building conversion began in 2023 and is a redevelopment led by the Brodsky Organization and the Sorgente Group.\"It's been a thrilling process because the building has this historical and architectural interest, but it also has this iconic shape,\" Lansill says. Landsill adds that because the building was designed for commercial use, it took the team about eight months to develop a concept that made sense. They eventually landed on two units per floor — a north and south apartment — plus two full-floor units on floors 20 and 21. Some of the amenities include a 60-foot lap pool, fitness center, billiards rooms and a piano lounge.Courtesy of The Flatiron BuildingPart of the conversation meant adding 21st-century amenities, including a wellness center, fitness center, sports simulator, lounge, 60-foot lap pool, billiards rooms and a piano lounge. The building also offers residents private storage and wine cellars for an extra fee. At the time of reporting, four apartments in the building have already sold, according to Lansill.

    "body": "Thomas Fuller | Sopa Images | Lightrocket | Getty ImagesCompany: CoStar Group Inc (CSGP)Business: CoStar Group engages in the provision of online real estate marketplaces, information, and analytics in the commercial and residential property markets. It operates through the following segments: CoStar Portfolio, Information Services Portfolio, Multifamily Portfolio, LoopNet Portfolio and Other Marketplaces Portfolio. The CoStar Portfolio segment consists of two classes of trade receivables based on geographical location: North America and International. The Information Services Portfolio segment includes four classes of trade receivables: CoStar Real Estate Manager; Hospitality, North America; Hospitality, International; and other Information Services. The Multifamily Portfolio, LoopNet Portfolio and Other Marketplaces Portfolio segments focus on one class of trade receivables. The company was founded by Andrew Florance and Michael Klein in 1987 and is headquartered in Arlington, Va.Stock Market Value: $26.07B ($61.50 per share) Ownership: 0.71%Average Cost: n/aActivist Commentary: Third Point is a multi-strategy hedge fund founded by Dan Loeb, that will selectively take activist positions. Loeb is one of the true pioneers in the field of shareholder activism and one of a handful of activists who shaped what has become modern-day shareholder activism. He invented the poison pen letter in a time when it was often necessary. As times have changed, he has transitioned from the poison pen to the power of the argument. Third Point has amicably gotten board representation at companies like Baxter and Disney, but the firm will not hesitate to launch a proxy fight if it is being ignored.What's happeningOn Jan. 27, Third Point sent a letter to the CoStar board calling on them to (i) replace a majority of the board and align management compensation to total shareholder return; (ii) consider strategic alternatives for Homes.com and related residential real estate (RRE) businesses; and (iii) refocus on the core commercial real estate (CRE) business. Third Point was previously bound by standstill restrictions following a settlement for board seats last year, which expired on Jan. 27. The firm now plans to nominate a new slate of directors.Behind the scenesCoStar Group (CSGP) is a provider of online real estate marketplaces, information, and analytics in the property market. It manages major brands including CoStar Suite, LoopNet, Apartments.com and Homes.com. Approximately 95% of the company's revenue is derived from its core commercial real estate (\"CRE\") franchises, which largely consists of CoStar Suite and Apartments.com. These businesses benefit from high barriers to entry, strong pricing power, proprietary data and subscription-based business models that drive recurring revenue and highly predictable free cash flow. Because of these dynamics, this business has historically traded at a premium to its Information Services peers but is now trading in line with them.This regression in the company's valuation largely stems from CoStar's aggressive investment into the residential real estate (\"RRE\") marketplace, Homes.com, which the company acquired in May 2021. From the beginning, CoStar's plan to build a dominant online classifieds business in the U.S. RRE industry was deeply flawed. Unlike its core CoStar Suite and Apartment.com businesses, Homes.com lacks clear competitive advantages and meaningful differentiation and faces intense competition from well-established peers like Zillow. Nevertheless, over the past five years, CoStar has invested roughly $5 billion in its RRE segment, $3 billion of which was in the U.S. Despite this massive investment, the U.S. RRE businesses generated only $60 million of revenue in 2024 and $80 million in 2025. Moreover, in addition to these direct financial losses, these initiatives have diverted focus from the core CRE business, limiting its growth potential.It was this backdrop that initially prompted Third Point to engage with CoStar last year, which ultimately resulted in a support agreement between the company, D.E. Shaw and Third Point. This agreement included (i) the addition of Christine McCarthy, John Berisford and Rachel Glaser as directors to the board; (ii) the retirement of Michael Klein, Christopher Nassetta and Laura Kaplan from the board; (iii) the appointment of Louise Sams as independent board chair; and (iv) the creation of a capital allocation committee. While these governance changes appeared to be a meaningful step in the right direction, progress has been deeply disappointing. Management has continued to move forward with its U.S. RRE initiatives, repeatedly shifting the strategy and missing targets even after they had been revised. In fact, the RRE business has gotten so bad that in 2025, the company cut Homes.com subscription pricing by over 30% and Homes.com is now expected to reduce 2025 adjusted EBITDA by more than 65%. Moreover, these losses are not going away anytime soon, as CoStar's new medium-term guidance now projects that Homes.com will not break even until 2030. Unsurprisingly, these failures continue to be reflected in the company's share performance, which has been underperforming the S&P 500 by over 45 percentage points since the date of the agreement and over 120 percentage points over the past five years.With the standstill period now expired, it's perhaps no surprise that Third Point is escalating its engagement, issuing a letter to the CoStar board calling on them to (i) replace a majority of the board and align management compensation to total shareholder return; (ii) consider strategic alternatives for Homes.com and related RRE businesses; and (iii) refocus on the core CRE business. While the latter two of these initiatives may feel intuitive given the aforementioned track record, it prompts the troubling question as to why this has not already been put into motion. The answer to that is the board's failure to hold management accountable. In fact, the company has rewarded CEO Andrew Florance. In 2024, he received approximately $37 million in total compensation, placing him in the top 10% of S&P 500 CEO earners despite the company being in the bottom 10% of performers. The board has done nothing to remedy this going forward as it has proposed tying only 25% of his future long-term incentives to total shareholder return, further disconnecting his pay from shareholder outcomes and particularly concerning for a CEO with de minimis stock ownership. This was done by the new board with three of eight directors recently appointed through the Third Point/D.E. Shaw settlement agreement, which appears to underscore the degree of control the CEO maintains over the company.While this may seem like a tall task, if Third Point succeeds, the upside potential appears significant. The firm points out that CoStar Suite alone has significant untapped pricing power, with an average selling price of just $350 per month, far below comparable information services products. Third Point also believes that the company has substantial opportunities to expand into adjacent end markets and develop new agentic products. Overall, Third Point believes that the CRE business should be capable of achieving EBITDA margins above 50% in the medium term, with further expansion over time given that peers ultimately achieve margins from 60% to 70%. In addition, the company's under-levered balance sheet also provides capacity for meaningful share repurchases, creating further opportunities for shareholder value creation. Putting it all together, absent the RRE distraction, Third Point believes that the CRE business could compound revenue at a mid-teens rate and grow earnings power per share in excess of 20% annually.This engagement is an example of shareholder activism the way it ought to be. Third Point quickly and amicably agreed to a settlement with the company to give it a chance to show Third Point that it can change its ways and start to turn around its poor performance. Had CoStar Group done that, you would not be reading this right now. But the company did the opposite, leaning into the strategy that has been failing it and its shareholders. So, now Third Point knows two things for sure: (i) change is definitely needed and (ii) three new directors is not enough to release the grip that Florance has on the board. We would expect to see Third Point nominate anywhere from three to six new directors. Two of the three directors (Christine McCarthy and John Berisford) appointed in last year's settlement were selected by Third Point, and we would expect them to not be targeted this year. So, assuming they are on the ballot as incumbents, Third Point could get a majority of the board by winning three seats. The decision whether to go for more than three will be made after consulting advisors on strategy and doing proxy math, particularly in the era of the universal ballot. There is an outside chance that the firm goes for eight if the company does not nominate McCarthy and Berisford. We would hope to see a Third Point executive nominated because in situations like this where substantial change is needed and that change has been met with resistance by a founder/CEO for so many years, it is helpful to have the activist in the room who designed the plan and is most passionate about it. While Third Point does not overtly call for it, it is hard to imagine a scenario where the firm wins meaningful board representation and Florance stays on as CEO – it does not seem like either of them would want that.Third Point, founded by Dan Loeb, is a true pioneer in shareholder activism, but has used it more sparingly in recent years as dictated by the market environment and available opportunities. He invented the poison pen letter in a time when it was often necessary. As times have changed, he has transitioned from the poison pen to the power of the argument. However, in this campaign we see shades of the old Dan Loeb – using phrases like \"feckless board of directors\" and \"CEO and his supine enablers.\" We particularly enjoyed his analogy of a CEO's compensation to elementary school children who win participation awards for finishing last. CoStar Group saw the new, more amicable Dan Loeb in April when he settled for three new directors. Now, the company may have woken up the Dan Loeb of the past, who has been in a sort of hibernation for years. We will not know for sure until March 13 when the nomination window opens.Ken Squire is the founder and president of 13D Monitor, an institutional research service on shareholder activism, and the founder and portfolio manager of the 13D Activist Fund, a mutual fund that invests in a portfolio of activist investments.",

Data from the card company shows that demand for high-end products and luxury experiences is accelerating, while purchases in more basic categories rises at a slower pace.Spending at luxury retailers surged 15% in the quarter, business and first-class airfare purchases rose 9%, and luxury hotel spending was up 12%, CFO Christophe Le Caillec told CNBC in an interview.Meanwhile, spending at airlines and lodging more generally was up 3% and 5%, respectively, during the quarter, showing that the richest cardmembers are driving results.Card growth slowingThe commentary helped allay fears from analysts that the relaunch of the pricey Platinum card last fall hadn't gone well.AmEx said Friday that new card accounts hit 2.9 million at year-end, a decline from the third quarter and the lowest figure in the past five quarters, as the company focused on its more profitable card products. \"We are incrementally worried that the Platinum Card refresh isn't generating much traction,\" said BTIG analysts led by Vincent Caintic, citing new competition from other card issuers and consumer weariness over high fees and cumbersome perks.While the company doesn't disclose its total number of cardmembers, including for the Platinum card, Squeri told analysts Friday that \"all of the metrics that we look at speaks to the fact that this was a wildly successful product launch.\"Still, shares of AmEx were down about 3.5% in midday trading after the company's results and guidance disappointed some. Earnings per share of $3.53 were a penny below the consensus estimate, according to LSEG. That was due in part to higher-than-expected expenses, at $14.5 billion, driven by the costs of the Platinum refresh, the company said.\"If there is a rub, perhaps it is that 4Q clearly shows the cost of the Platinum refresh, but doesn't show a corresponding bump on new accounts,\" wrote Truist analyst Brian Foran in a research note.",

    "body": "Eli Lilly Chair and CEO Dave Ricks speaks during a press conference in Houston, Sept. 23, 2025.Antranik Tavitian | ReutersEli Lilly on Friday said it will spend more than $3.5 billion to build a manufacturing plant in Pennsylvania's Lehigh Valley that will help make its next-generation obesity drugs.That includes a closely watched experimental drug called retatrutide, which has shown the highest weight loss seen to date for any treatment in a late-stage trial. It is the fourth facility in a string of new planned U.S. investments by the pharmaceutical giant. Lilly announced in February 2025 that it would spend at least $27 billion to build new domestic manufacturing facilities, adding to $23 billion in previous investments since 2020. On Thursday, President Donald Trump said Lilly CEO Dave Ricks has told him the drugmaker aims to build six plants in the U.S. But Lilly has not confirmed those plans. The company on Friday said it expects construction of the Pennsylvania plant to start this year and for the site to be operational in 2031. That added production capacity for upcoming weight loss treatments is crucial. Retatrutide is viewed as a key pillar of Lilly's long-term obesity strategy after its popular injection Zepbound and upcoming obesity pill. Some health experts say retatrutide, which works by targeting three gut hormones rather than one or two, can reach patients with severe obesity who would benefit from even more weight loss than what existing injections can offer. Lilly plans to release data from seven other Phase 3 trials on the drug this year. The company and its chief rival, Novo Nordisk, have invested heavily in boosting production capacity after previously facing supply shortages for their existing weekly injections in the U.S. Preparing enough supply of upcoming drugs is also central to Lilly's efforts to maintain its dominance in the booming GLP-1 market. The company secured the majority share in the space last year for the first time, overtaking Novo. But the Danish drugmaker is hoping to close the gap with the launch of the first-ever GLP-1 pill for obesity this month, which has already racked up thousands of U.S. prescriptions. Lilly has its own pill, orforglipron, that could win approval and launch later this year. Drugmakers have been scrambling to boost their production in the U.S. after threats by President Donald Trump to impose tariffs on pharmaceuticals imported into the U.S. But concerns about those potential tariffs have eased following voluntary drug pricing deals with Trump in recent months that exempt companies — including both Lilly and Novo — from the levies for three years. Eli Lilly said the Pennsylvania site will bring 850 jobs to the area, including engineers, scientists, operations personnel and lab technicians, as well as 2,000 construction jobs. ",

    "body": "Miami, Florida, Aventura Mall, GameStop store entrance front view, video game retailer shop. Jeff Greenberg | Universal Images Group | Getty ImagesGameStop wants to acquire a publicly traded consumer company that's far larger than the video game retailer in a deal that could be \"transformational\" for the company, CEO Ryan Cohen told CNBC in an interview Friday.\"It's gonna be really big. Really big. Very, very, very big,\" Cohen said of the size of the acquisition. \"It's transformational. Not just for GameStop, but ultimately, within the capital markets … this is something that really has never been done before within the history of the capital markets.\"Cohen declined to name the company's targets – saying only he's seeking a publicly traded consumer company that's undervalued, \"high quality, durable, scalable with growth prospects\" and has a \"sleepy management team\" behind the wheel. He claimed if the investment pans out, it has the \"potential to make [GameStop] worth several hundreds of billions of dollars.\" \"If it works, it's genius. If it doesn't work, then, you know, it will be totally, totally foolish,\" Cohen, the co-founder and former CEO of Chewy, acknowledged. \"But I believe we have the components to make it work, and I'm very confident in the ability to make the asset much, much, much more efficient … we've got the governance structure, we've got the capital, we have the operational expertise.\"While Cohen has transformed GameStop from a dying legacy retailer into a money making business, it's unclear how an acquisition in the consumer space could increase its worth to over $100 billion – a herculean task for a business with a $10.5 billion market cap.One investment banker in the consumer and retail space was skeptical Cohen could pull it off, saying there are very few businesses in the sector that could increase GameStop's value so dramatically.\"I've never seen it,\" the person said. \"Unless you're talking about radically transforming a business model or something, it just doesn't happen in retail.\"Another agreed. \"It's easy to say something,\" the person said. \"It's a lot harder to do it.\"GameStop's ambitions to balloon in size first came to light in early January. The company unveiled a new, all-or-nothing equity incentive for Cohen that will only pay out if it reaches a market cap of $100 billion and sees $10 billion in cumulative earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. If GameStop's acquisition plans succeed and its market value hits $100 billion or more, Cohen gets his payday — but he said he hopes \"all shareholders do\" as well.Since taking over as GameStop's CEO in September 2023, Cohen has dramatically cut costs, improved the retailer's profitability and grown its collectibles business, even as overall sales have sagged.Between GameStop's fiscal 2023 third quarter, when Cohen took over, and its fiscal 2025 third quarter, its most recent quarter, GameStop's gross margin has grown by 7 percentage points and net income has climbed to $77.1 million, up from a loss of $3.1 million. In fiscal 2024 and 2025, the retailer posted consecutive annual net incomes following five straight years of losses.The company's success has attracted interest from Michael Burry — the investor who became famous after betting against the U.S. housing market ahead of the financial crisis — who recently disclosed that he's been buying shares. \"Ryan is making lemonade out of lemons,\" Burry said in a Monday Substack post. \"He has a crappy business, and he is milking it best he can while taking advantage of the meme stock phenomenon to raise cash and wait for an opportunity to make a big buy of a real growing cash cow business.\"Over the last two years, GameStop has also amassed a more than $9 billion cash pile between cash on hand and marketable securities – money the company had been using to invest in bitcoin. When asked if GameStop will liquidate its bitcoin holdings to help fund its acquisition plans, Cohen said he was \"not prepared to say,\" but called his new strategy \"way more compelling than bitcoin.\"\"It's similar to Berkshire Hathaway, except what Berkshire did in decades we're attempting to do in a much shorter time in terms of creating that much value,\" said Cohen. \"We can go in there and apply the Chewy and [GameStop] mindset of like brutal efficiency and increase the profitability of the company very, very quickly and so we could capture a lot more value by focusing on this under optimized asset, and then eventually we could move on to the next one, but, you know, we'll see what happens.\"",

    "body": "A United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocket is on the launch pad carrying Amazon's Project Kuiper internet network satellites, which are expected to eventually rival Elon Musk's Starlink system, at the Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Cape Canaveral, Florida, on April 9, 2025.Steve Nesius | ReutersAmazon has asked the Federal Communications Commission for more time to meet a deadline that requires the company to deploy roughly 1,600 internet satellites by July 2026. The company needs to bring more of its satellites online so it can begin offering an internet-from-space service that was recently rebranded as Amazon Leo. The company has earmarked at least $10 billion to build the network.Delays beyond Amazon's control, including a \"shortage in the near-term availability\" of rockets, necessitate an extension, the company said in a filing made public on Friday. Amazon also pointed to manufacturing disruptions, the failure and grounding of new launch vehicles and limitations on spaceport capacity. Leo is \"producing satellites considerably faster than others can launch them,\" the company wrote. The company is now seeking a 24-month extension, to July 2028, or for the FCC to waive its deadline requiring Amazon to get roughly half of its 3,236 low Earth satellites up. In 2019, Amazon unveiled its plans to build a constellation of low Earth satellites. They are designed to provide high-speed, low-latency internet to consumers, corporations and governments, offering connections through square-shaped terminals. Amazon has booked more than 100 launches to deploy dozens of satellites at a time. The company said in the filing that it has bought 10 more launches with Elon Musk's SpaceX, as well as a dozen additional rides with Blue Origin, the space exploration startup of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos.The company said that many of its partners have notched significant launch milestones with their respective rockets in the past year. \"Not withstanding this progress, the development timelines for these next-generation vehicles have extended beyond initial projections, contributing to Amazon Leo's deployment delays,\" the company wrote.Amazon has sent up more than 150 satellites since April. The company said it expects to deploy about 700 satellites by July 30, \"moving from the third- to the second-largest satellite constellation in orbit.\" Its next launch is slated for Feb. 12, when Amazon will fling another 32 satellite into space atop a rocket from Arianespace, a French company. Leo's primary rival is SpaceX's Starlink, which has more than 9,000 satellites in orbit and roughly 9 million customers. Another challenger, OneWeb, is operated by France's Eutelsat and has a constellation of more than 600 satellites.In November, Amazon opened up an \"enterprise preview\" of Leo to select users ahead of a broader commercial launch. Amazon said if the FCC were to deny it an extension, it would \"undermine\" the agency's goals of expanding spectrum access and promoting \"expeditious deployment.\" The company also noted that the agency has previously granted similar extensions.\"Amazon Leo is engaged in full-scale deployment and stands on the doorstep of offering U.S. customers a competitive and innovative new service,\" the company said. \"An extension would enable this rapid and ongoing deployment to continue, while strict enforcement would interrupt or halt this effort.\" WATCH: Amazon laying off about 16,000 corporate workers in latest anti-bureaucracy pushwatch now",

Denis Balibouse | ReutersGold and silver prices plunged Friday, as President Donald Trump's nomination for the next chair of the Federal Reserve, Kevin Warsh, appeared to relieve concerns about the central bank's independence and sent the dollar soaring. Spot silver was down 28% at $83.45 an ounce, trading near its lows of the day. Silver futures plummeted 31.4% to settle at $78.53, marking its worst day since March 1980.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconSpot silverMeanwhile, spot gold shed around 9% to trade at $4,895.22 an ounce. Gold futures dropped 11.4% to settle at $4,745.10.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconSpot goldThe sharp moves down were initially triggered by reports of Warsh's nomination. However, they gained steam in afternoon U.S. trading as investors who piled into the metals raced to book profits. Metals were also under pressure as the dollar spiked higher, making it more expensive for foreign investors to buy gold and silver and spoiling the theory that metals would replace the greenback as the globe's reserve currency. The dollar index last traded around 0.8% higher. \"This is getting crazy,\" said Matt Maley, equity strategist at Miller Tabak. \"Most of this is probably 'forced selling.' This has been the hottest asset for day traders and other short-term traders recently. So, there has been some leverage built up in silver. With the huge decline today, the margin calls went out.\"Trump picks WarshNational Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett had been the favorite to replace Powell for some time, but Warsh became the front-runner in prediction markets in recent days. In a note on Friday morning, Evercore ISI's Krishna Guha said the market was \"trading Warsh hawkish.\"\"The Warsh pick should help stabilize the dollar some and reduce (though not eliminate) the asymmetric risk of deep extended dollar weakness by challenging debasement trades – which is also why gold and silver are sharply lower,\" the firm's vice chairman said.\"But, we advise against overdoing the Warsh hawkish trade across asset markets – and even see some risk of a whipsaw. We see Warsh as a pragmatist not an ideological hawk in the tradition of the independent conservative central banker.\"Claudio Wewel, FX strategist at J. Safra Sarasin Sustainable Asset Management, told CNBC's \"Squawk Box Europe\" on Friday that a \"perfect storm\" of geopolitical tensions had helped precious metals move higher this year, pointing to the U.S. capture of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and Washington's threats to use military force in Greenland and Iran.More recently, he said, speculation over who would be nominated as the next Fed chair had been influencing metals markets. \"The market has clearly been pricing the risk of a much more dovish contender, that's been largely helping the gold price along with other precious metal prices. Over the last 24 hours, the news flow has changed a little bit,\" Wewel said, prior to Trump's announcement. 'Even good assets can sell-off'Gold and silver both enjoyed record-smashing rallies in 2025, surging 66% and 135%, respectively, over the course of the year.Coeur Mining lost 17%. Silver ETFs were dragged into the action, with the ProShares Ultra Silver fund last seen more than 62% lower. The iShares Silver Trust ETF lost 31%. Both funds were headed for their worst days on record. Precious metals have been on a stellar rally over the past 12 months, amid broader market volatility, the decline of the U.S. dollar, bubbling geopolitical tensions and concerns about the independence of the Federal Reserve. Katy Stoves, investment manager at British wealth management firm Mattioli Woods, told CNBC on Friday morning that the moves were likely \"a market-wide reassessment of concentration risk.\" \"Just as tech stocks — particularly AI-related names — have dominated market attention and capital flows, gold has similarly seen intense positioning and crowding,\" she said. \"When everyone is leaning the same way, even good assets can sell off as positions get unwound. The parallel isn't accidental: both represent areas where capital has flooded in based on powerful narratives, and concentrated positions eventually face their day of reckoning.\"Meanwhile, Toni Meadows, head of investment at BRI Wealth Management, contended that gold's run to the $5,000 mark had happened \"too easily.\" He noted that the unwinding of the greenback had supported gold prices, but that the dollar had appeared to stabilize. \"Central bank buying has driven the longer-term rally but this has tailed off in recent months,\" he said. \"The case for further reserve diversification is still there though as Trump's trade policies and intervention in foreign affairs will make a lot of countries nervous about holding U.S. assets, especially those countries in the emerging markets or aligned to China or Russia. Silver will mirror the direction of gold, so it is not surprising to see falls there.\"",

    "body": "The logo for Google LLC is seen at the Google Store Chelsea in Manhattan, New York, Nov. 17, 2021.Andrew Kelly | ReutersA federal jury in San Francisco on Thursday convicted a former Google software engineer of stealing trade secrets related to the search company's AI technology.The jury found 38 year-old Linwei Ding, also known as Leon Ding, guilty on seven counts of economic espionage and seven counts of theft of trade secrets related to stealing thousands of pages of confidential information from Google to benefit the People's Republic of China, according to court documents. \"In today's high-stakes race to dominate the field of artificial intelligence, Linwei Ding betrayed both the U.S. and his employer by stealing trade secrets about Google's AI technology on behalf of China's government,\" said Roman Rozhavsky, assistant director of the FBI's Counterintelligence and Espionage Division, in a statement Friday. \"Today's verdict affirms that federal law will be enforced to protect our nation's most valuable technologies and hold those who steal them accountable.\"The case marks the first conviction on AI-related economic espionage charges in the U.S., according to the Department of Justice. Google executives and U.S. leaders have been vocal about the AI arms race, particularly between the U.S. and China. Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis recently told CNBC that Chinese AI models might be \"a matter of months\" behind U.S. and Western capabilities.The jury's decision comes after Ding was originally indicted in 2024. U.S. District Judge Vince Chhabria for the Northern District of California oversaw the 11-day trial that led to Thursday's decision. Between May 2022 and April 2023, Ding stole more than 2,000 pages of Google's AI trade secrets and uploaded them to his personal Google Cloud account, the DOJ said Friday. At the time, Ding had been affiliated with two tech companies based in China and was in the process of creating his own tech company.The trade secrets contained detailed information about the architecture of Google's custom Tensor Processing Unit chips and the company's graphics processing unit systems, according to the DOJ. The trade secrets also included details about Google's custom-built SmartNIC, a specialized network interface card that enables high-speed communication across its AI supercomputers and cloud networking systems.Ding's attorney Grant Fondo reportedly argued that Google didn't do enough to protect the information. He argued that the documents in question were available to thousands of employees and therefore could not have contained trade secrets, adding \"Google chose openness over security,\" according to Courthouse News Service.Ding, whose next court date is Tuesday, faces a potential maximum sentence of 10 years in prison for each count of theft of trade secrets and 15 years in prison for each count of economic espionage, according to the DOJ.\"We're grateful to the jury for making sure justice was served today, sending a clear message that stealing trade secrets has serious consequences,\" Lee-Anne Mulholland, Google vice president of regulatory affairs, said in a statement to CNBC.WATCH: Meta and Google go to trial over child safety — here's what's at stakewatch now",

    "body": "Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell are seen in this image released by the Department of Justice in Washington on Dec. 19, 2025, as part of a new trove of documents from its investigations into the late financier and convicted sex offender. Date and context is unclear.U.s. Justice Department | Via ReutersThe Department of Justice on Friday is releasing more than 3 million additional pages of documents related to Jeffrey Epstein, along with more than 2,000 videos and 180,000 images, Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said.The large release comes after weeks of criticism that the DOJ was not complying with the requirement under federal law passed in November that all files related to the notorious sex offender Epstein be publicly released by Dec. 19.Blanche said Friday the DOJ was not releasing the rest of what are more than 6 million total pages identified as potentially responsive to the Epstein Transparency Act.A group of victims of Epstein in a statement blasted the DOJ for what it called the \"incomplete\" release of the files.\"This latest release of Jeffrey Epstein files is being sold as transparency, but what it actually does is expose survivors,\" said the group in a statement obtained by MS Now.\"Once again, survivors are having their names and identifying information exposed, while the men who abused us remain hidden and protected. That is outrageous. As survivors, we should never be the ones named, scrutinized, and retraumatized while Epstein's enablers continue to benefit from secrecy. This is a betrayal of the very people this process is supposed to serve,\" the statement said. \"The Justice Department cannot claim it is finished releasing files until every legally required document is released and every abuser and enabler is fully exposed,\" the victims said. \"We need to hear directly from Attorney General Pam Bondi when she appears before the House Judiciary Committee on February 11. Survivors deserve answers, and the public deserves the truth.\"This is not over,\" the women said. \"We will not stop until the truth is fully revealed and every perpetrator is finally held accountable. As we have always said, this is not about politics. We hope Democrats and Republicans will stand with survivors in continuing to demand the full release of the Epstein files.\"Speaking at a press conference at DOJ headquarters in Washington, Blanche said that more than 500 DOJ lawyers and other personnel had spent the past 75 days reviewing potential material related to Epstein and determining what needed to be released under the law.Deputy U.S. Attorney General Todd Blanche speaks during a press conference at the Justice Department in Washington, Jan. 30, 2026.Elizabeth Frantz | Reuters\"We're releasing more than 3 million pages today, and not the 6 million pages that we collected,\" Blanche said. \"That means that the department produced approximately 3½ million pages in compliance with the act.\"He said that no more documents would be released. The large release on Friday comes weeks after DOJ released a much-smaller tranche of Epstein-related documents on Dec. 19.\"Today's release marks the end of a very comprehensive documentation, document identification and review process to ensure transparency to the American people and compliance with the act,\" Blanche said.Some of the material released relates to Epstein's convicted accomplice, Ghislaine Maxwell, who is serving a 20-year federal prison sentence for crimes related to procuring underage girls for him to abuse. Epstein killed himself in a federal jail in New York in August 2019, weeks after being arrested on child sex trafficking charges.Read more CNBC politics coverageMore Jeffrey Epstein files being released by DOJ, Blanche saysLuigi Mangione won't face death penalty in CEO murder case, federal judge rulesSenate to vote on funding deal soon as shutdown looms, GOP Sens. predictFeds arrested Don Lemon, former CNN anchor, over Minnesota activities: LawyerSen.

We did not protect President Trump ... or anybody.\"President Donald Trump had been friends with Epstein for years before the two men had a falling out in the mid-2000s.\"There's not some tranche of super-secret documents about Jeffrey Epstein that we're withholding,\" Blanche said.",

    "body": "You need to have the right skills to do the job you're hoping to land. But your ability to communicate that you have them — and can use them to help your prospective employer become more successful — is just as important.\"The things that make us good at communication also make us very, very attractive in an interview,\" Charles Duhigg tells CNBC Make It. Duhigg has studied hundreds of people in authoring three books on productivity, habits and communication. His latest book, \"Supercommunicators: How to Unlock the Secret Language of Connection,\" examines what sets the most effective communicators apart.Duhigg shared three communication tips that candidates should take into their next job interviews to connect with the person on the other side of the table (or screen) and make a stronger impression.1. Give authentic answersInterviewers know candidates are eager to impress. But if your answers to interview questions sound too polished or canned, you could be doing yourself a disservice.\"They know that you're performing; they know that you're there to try and get a job,\" Duhigg says. But the more we can \"genuinely convey who we are,\" the more the employer has \"a chance to see whether we'll actually succeed there.\"Answering questions genuinely, but tactfully, can help you stand out, he adds. \"The interviewer is going to remember that answer,\" he says. \"The best communication is the most genuine communication.\"One of the toughest questions to answer in an interview is \"Tell me about your weaknesses.\"If they ask a question like this, Duhigg says, \"and I answer it as honestly as I can, it doesn't mean that I have to expose my flaws, it doesn't mean that I have to say something out of line.\"Career coach Madeline Mann previously told CNBC Make It that an ideal answer would briefly explain a genuine weakness, but not one that's \"core to the job,\" before laying out steps you're taking to address the problem area.2. Ask questions\"Think about how many people go into an interview and the person asks them, 'Do you have any questions for me?' and the question they ask is completely predictable,\" Duhigg says.The best communicators typically \"ask a lot more questions\" than their peers, Duhigg says. They also ask what he calls deep questions, or those that center on a person's values, beliefs or experience.For job candidates, that might mean asking an interviewer how they got into that line of work, or what their favorite part of working there is.3. Mirror their body languageSome of the most important communication is silent. Body language can be very telling, and mirroring things like your interviewer's posture, gestures and expressions can make you a more attractive candidate for the job.That could be as simple as smiling back when they smile during conversation or noticing when they lean in and doing the same.\"The more we are prepared and comfortable doing that, the better off that interview is going to go,\" Duhigg says.Want to get ahead at work with AI?

    "body": "Elon Musk looks on as President Donald Trump speaks at the US-Saudi Investment Forum at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington, Nov. 19, 2025.Brendan Smialowski | Afp | Getty ImagesA cache of newly released documents from the Epstein files on Friday showed Elon Musk apparently corresponded with the convicted sex offender in 2012 and 2013, as they discussed meeting at Jeffrey Epstein's private island and at Musk's SpaceX facility in Southern California. The emails indicate Musk asked about attending the \"wildest party,\" hosted by Epstein at his island. Musk, who serves as CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, has for years downplayed his connection to Epstein, who died by suicide in 2019 while in federal custody. \"Epstein tried to get me to go to his island and I REFUSED,\" Musk said in a post on his social network X in September. He also complained that Sky News had mentioned him in conjunction with Epstein before naming Britain's Prince Andrew, who had visited the island. The U.S. Virgin Islands issued a subpoena to Musk in 2023 because of suspicion that Epstein \"may have referred or attempted to refer\" Musk as a client to JPMorgan Chase.The Department of Justice on Friday released millions of additional pages of documents related to Epstein, along with more than 2,000 videos and 180,000 images, Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said. The release comes after weeks of criticism that the DOJ wasn't complying with the requirement under federal law passed in November that all files related to Epstein be publicly released by Dec. 19.Among the documents released Friday were emails dated from 2012 to 2013, showing Musk's name but with his email address redacted.\"The world needs more romance,\" Musk wrote to Epstein in October 2012, the documents indicate. He told Epstein that he would be traveling with his partner at the time, English actress Talulah Riley, to St. Barts, and was looking to potentially connect at Epstein's Island.In a November 2013 email, Epstein offered to send Musk a private helicopter to transport him to the island and asked, \"how many people will you be for the heli to island?\" Musk responded that it would be just him and Riley and asked, \"What day/night will be the wildest party on your island?\"In a December 2013 email, Musk again wrote to Epstein saying, \"Christmas and New Year's, will be in the BVI /St Bart's area over the holidays. Is there a good time to visit?\"  \"I will send heli for you,\" Epstein responded, with Musk writing back, \"Thanks.\"In a follow-up email on Dec. 25, Musk said, \"Actually, I could fly back early on the 3rd. We will be in St Bart's.\" He asked if he and Riley should head to the island the day before. CNBC hasn't confirmed whether Musk ever visited the Island, though Musk has denied ever traveling there. Musk didn't respond to a request for comment. The emails released on Friday also show that in October 2012, Musk forwarded questions from Epstein to his cousin, Peter Rive, a SolarCity founder. Musk had invested personally in SolarCity and sat on the company's board.In the emails, Epstein asked if the solar installer could electrify his New Mexico ranch, or his private Island. Musk asked Rive, in an Oct. 4, 2012 email, \"Are we in New Mexico?\" Tesla acquired SolarCity in 2016 in a controversial deal, folding it into what would become the company's energy division. In June of last year, Musk wrote in a post on X, that he thought President Donald Trump and his administration were withholding Epstein-related files from the public view in order to protect the president's reputation.\"Time to drop the really big bomb: @realDonaldTrump is in the Epstein files,\" Musk, who was in the midst of a public spat with the president, wrote at the time. \"That is the real reason they have not been made public. Have a nice day, DJT!\"Days later he apologized for posts about Trump that he said \"went too far.\"WATCH: House votes to release more Epstein investigation files",

    "body": "watch nowEli Lilly CEO Dave Ricks on Friday said upcoming Medicare coverage of obesity drugs could be a major catalyst for the rollout of the company's closely watched experimental weight loss pill, orforglipron.In an exclusive interview with CNBC, Ricks said Lilly expects to have Medicare coverage for the treatment \"immediately following that launch, and that will change the game a bit too.\" He said that's because many patients are currently paying in cash for competitor Novo Nordisk's GLP-1 pill for obesity. That launched earlier this month and is off to a strong start, even with spotty insurance coverage. Ricks said he noticed that nearly all of the early adopters of Novo's Wegovy pill are new to GLP-1 treatments rather than users of existing injections, so \"it's expansive, it's reaching more patients and that's great.\" He added that Lilly is confident in its pill's ability to compete and is preparing for a \"full launch\" in the second quarter. The rollout is set to coincide with Medicare starting to cover obesity medicines for the first time later this year under drug pricing deals Lilly and Novo struck with President Donald Trump in November. Eli Lilly CEO Dave Ricks speaks during a press conference in Houston, Sept. 23, 2025.Antranik Tavitian | ReutersThat government coverage will bring the price point of pills even lower in the second half of the year, Ricks said. Certain Medicare patients will pay a copay of $50 per month for all approved uses of injectable and oral GLP-1 drugs, including diabetes and obesity treatment.\"That opens up things pretty wide, and we'll see where we can go from there,\" Ricks said. Medicare coverage of obesity treatments is a long-awaited move that some health experts say could broaden the market for the medicines and spur more private insurers to cover them. Ricks estimates that 20 million to 30 million Medicare beneficiaries who are suffering from obesity and related health conditions could be eligible for GLP-1 treatments, so coverage is a \"big multiplier on the eligible pool.\"Ricks acknowledged that under the drug pricing deal, there will be \"a step down in pricing\" early this year. The agreements involve drugmakers voluntarily offering their medications for less, including selling their existing treatments to Medicaid patients at the lowest prices abroad, and guaranteeing that so-called most-favored nation pricing for new medicines.But Ricks said volume growth of Lilly's drugs \"will ramp on the back half of the year.' \"We think that's a positive balance for us, but time will tell,\" he said, adding that it will be based on uptake of the treatments among Medicare patients and the company's share of that adoption. Lilly will share more details on the financial impact of the deal when it posts its fourth-quarter earnings and 2026 guidance next week, he said. The price agreements include commitments to launch drugs at discounted cash-pay prices on Trump's direct-to-consumer platform, TrumpRx. That site, which was expected to launch in January, is not yet live.Ricks said Lilly was the first drugmaker to sell obesity treatments directly to patients through the company's platform, LillyDirect, and TrumpRx is \"taking that and expanding it across the industry\" to other medicines.\"We're all for that,\" he said.",

    "body": "A General Motors Co. Chevrolet Blazer electric vehicle at a dealership in Colma, California, Jan. 23, 2026.David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesDETROIT — American consumers are hitting a fork in the road when it comes to the U.S. automotive industry. Affluent buyers are purchasing new vehicles at increasingly higher prices, while lower-income ones are continuing to drive used models.This trend is a growing concern for auto executives and feeds into worries that U.S. consumers are facing a \"K-shaped\" economy, where the wealthy keep seeing gains while those who have lower incomes struggle.\"We have a different vehicle buyer today than we had just a few years ago,\" Cox Automotive senior economist Charlie Chesbrough said Thursday during an auto analyst event. \"The key takeaway here is that we're seeing the average buyer here is much more affluent.\"Cox reports that the share of new-car buyers with incomes of less than $100,000 has dropped from 50% in 2020 to 37% last year, representing millions of lost sales. On the other end of the spectrum, the share of buyers with incomes of more than $200,000 has grown from 18% to 29% during that timeframe.The shift has occurred as MSRP, or manufacturer's suggested retail price, hit an average of $51,000 in 2025, according to Cox, and as buyers are also dealing with higher insurance costs and inflation. Consumer sentiment, meanwhile, is at recessionary levels.New-car sales were at record levels of more than 17 million prior to 2020 but have experienced mixed results since, ending 2025 with 16.3 million sales. Brand-new vehicles have never been for the majority of U.S. consumers, but automakers have increasingly been pricing millions of Americans out, including by cutting entry-level vehicle lines such as small cars.\"We're now relying on the extremely wealthy to generate the sales,\" Mark Barrott, a partner at consulting firm Plante Moran, said during the Thursday event. \"That's a structural problem from an affordability perspective.\"Barrott said U.S. sales aren't hitting records but that they're still pretty good compared with historical levels. Automotive executives may begin taking more notice if the market conditions shrink due to buyers getting priced out, he added.\"It's not unrealistic to think that in the next two or three years we could get to that kind of level, and then this really starts to hurt the [automakers],\" he said.A modeling study by Plante Moran found a third of the U.S. population can't afford new vehicles, with very limited choices for those who may be on the fence. There are roughly 110 \"affordable\" models, in relative terms, for household incomes of $65,000 or less compared with more than 250 \"affordable\" models for those with incomes of up to $105,000, according to the study.The median household income in the U.S. was $83,730 in 2024, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. That has risen 24% since 2020, when it was $67,521.U.S. average transaction prices for new vehicles, meanwhile, were hovering around $50,000 toward the end of last year, up 30% from less than $38,747 to begin 2020, according to Cox Automotive.CarMax's Edmunds this month reported new-car buyers are increasingly spending more per month on the purchase of a new vehicle, with a record of 20% committing to average monthly payments of more than $1,000 during the fourth quarter of last year.Ford CEO Jim Farley earlier this month warned the U.S. automotive industry needs to be mindful of affordability concerns leading to consumer pullback. While producing larger, more expensive vehicles can be more profitable for automakers, it can shrink the market and lower sales. \"Anyone in the auto industry … we should all be very careful about consumer demand,\" Farley said Jan. 13 during an event for the Detroit Auto Show. \"That's really important.\"Read more CNBC auto newsAuto executives are hoping for the best and planning for the worst in 2026GM expects to top Ford in U.S. vehicle production as it faces up to $4 billion in tariff costsStellantis stock off 43% as Jeep maker turns five, executes turnaroundEV realism is here.

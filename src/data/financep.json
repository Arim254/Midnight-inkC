    "body": "Paramount Skydance CEO David Ellison speaks during the Bloomberg Screentime conference in Los Angeles on October 9, 2025. Patrick T. Fallon | Afp | Getty ImagesParamount Skydance has already informed Warner Bros. Discovery it believes its $23.50 per share acquisition offer is in the best interest of shareholders. Now it has to plan on what to do if the WBD board disagrees.WBD is openly for sale and intends to publicly announce its plans toward the middle or end of December, according to people familiar with the matter, who asked not to be named because the discussions are private. The legacy media giant, run by Chief Executive Officer David Zaslav, is deciding whether to split the company in two, sell some assets or sell the entire company.Paramount has sent WBD's board multiple letters explaining why its offer is more valuable to shareholders than splitting the company, signaling negotiations could turn more aggressive if WBD chooses other options. CNBC has reviewed copies of two of the letters.A portion of a Paramount letter dated Oct. 13 specifically details the company's argument that its latest offer of $23.50 per share \"delivers superior value\" for WBD shareholders compared with any reasonable plan to break up the company.Roughly a week after receiving that letter, WBD said it would begin \"a comprehensive review of strategic alternatives to identify the best path forward to unlock the full value of our assets.\"The sale process was formally launched after WBD's announcement in June that it would split into two companies — a streaming and studios company to be called Warner Bros., which would include WBD movie properties and streaming service HBO Max, and a global networks company called Discovery Global, which would house CNN, TNT Sports and Discovery, among other businesses. Both companies would trade publicly on their own.The strategic options aren't mutually exclusive. Given an expected yearlong (or more) regulatory approval process, splitting the company into two and then selling one or both parts would be the most tax-efficient way to sell, according to the people familiar with the matter. The split, expected to be completed by April, is a tax-free transaction.Comcast and Netflix have shown interest in acquiring the studio and streaming assets, CNBC has previously reported. If Warner Bros. Discovery decides its best value-creation path is to sell Warner Bros., it plans to make that announcement in December, before the split takes place, said the people familiar.Comcast President Mike Cavanagh said last week during the company's earnings report that such an acquisition would be complementary to its post-Versant-spin NBCUniversal business.Warner Bros. Discovery is scheduled to announce third-quarter earnings Thursday morning.Paramount's hostile decisionWarner Bros. Discovery has rejected three different offers from Paramount for a full takeover of the company. The last, for $23.50 a share, was comprised of 80% cash and 20% equity, CNBC reported last month.Paramount executives are willing to wait to see if Warner Bros. Discovery's board decides to engage in friendly sale discussions, according to people familiar with the company's thinking.But, if WBD stalls in its decision or decides to move in a different direction, Paramount has discussed taking an offer directly to shareholders and formalizing a hostile bid for the company, the people said.Warner Bros. Discovery asked Paramount to sign a nondisclosure agreement that includes a standstill provision that would prevent Paramount from launching a hostile tender offer in return for access to its data room, according to people familiar with the matter. Paramount hasn't signed the NDA to keep its options open, one person said.Spokespeople for Warner Bros. Discovery and Paramount declined to comment.If Paramount appeals directly to shareholders, it will argue that its offer is superior relative to Warner Bros. Discovery's closing price on Sept. 10, the day before The Wall Street Journal reported Paramount was preparing a bid for the company. Warner Bros. Discovery closed at $12.54 per share on Sept. 10. A $23.50 per share offer is 87% higher than the so-called unaffected share price.Warner Bros. Discovery will have to persuade its shareholders that splitting the company or merging one of its units with another entity, such as NBCUniversal, is more shareholder friendly than an outright sale.Paramount has already laid out the math to Warner Bros. Discovery in the Oct. 13 letter obtained by CNBC. Here's the argument from the letter, addressed to the Warner Bros. Discovery board of directors and signed by Paramount Skydance Chairman and CEO David Ellison:\"We understand that you and your leadership team are optimistic about potential value creation from your planned break-up. However, a more objective analysis yields results meaningfully below the consideration to WBD shareholders in our proposal. We have analyzed the value of the planned break-up to WBD shareholders at the end of 2028 based on optimistic assumptions, including:Warner Bros. outperforming consensus EBITDA by ~$500 million (10%) and trading at the same multiple as Disney, despite the iconic global company that Disney represents across its businessesDiscovery Global achieving consensus EBITDA, despite meaningful headwinds, and trading at the media of analyst research \"sum-of-the-parts\" multiples for the businessAn illustrative 25-40% M&A premium applied to Warner Bros.Based on these assumptions, the planned break-up would generate a present value to WBD shareholders of less than $15 per share on a trading basis, or ~$18 to ~$20 per share including a robust, yet highly uncertain, M&A premium for Warner Bros.\"Regulatory uncertaintyParamount can also argue its deal for the entirety of Warner Bros. Discovery is well positioned to gain regulatory approval, given President Donald Trump's recent kind words about Ellison and his father, Larry, who is one of the world's richest people and who could contribute tens of billions of his personal money to help finance a transaction.\"I think you have a great, new leader,\" Trump said of David Ellison during a CBS \"60 Minutes\" interview last week. \"I think one of the best things to happen is this show and new ownership, CBS and new ownership. I think it's the greatest thing that's happened in a long time to a free and open and good press.\"In stark contrast, Trump has repeatedly bashed Comcast CEO Brian Roberts, including calling him a \"lowlife\" and a \"slimeball.\"Some analysts have speculated Comcast could try to structure a deal with Warner Bros. Discovery where it would spin NBCUniversal and merge it with the studio and streaming assets.Get the CNBC Sport newsletter directly to your inboxThe CNBC Sport newsletter with Alex Sherman brings you the biggest news and exclusive interviews from the worlds of sports business and media, delivered weekly to your inbox.Subscribe here to get access today.It's unclear if shareholders will be bullish on the future prospects of either Discovery Global or Warner Bros. as stand-alone entities.Discovery Global's collection of linear cable networks, such as TNT, TBS and CNN, faces declining advertising rates on top of annual cable subscriptions that are falling by the millions.Warner Bros.' HBO Max and the Warner Bros. movie studio may command a sizable M&A premium in a sale if Comcast, Paramount and Netflix are all potential buyers, but the price would have to be high enough to convince WBD shareholders that it's a better option than selling the entire company.Still, even if Paramount does decide to take an offer directly to shareholders, tender offers aren't guarantee to succeed.A threshold of just 20% of Warner Bros. Discovery shareholders who have held the stock for at least a year is needed to call a special meeting to potentially fight off a hostile bid, according to a company filing. Those long-term Warner Bros. Discovery shareholders may argue current management and the board are the best stewards of the company.Disclosure: Comcast is the parent company of NBCUniversal, which owns CNBC. Versant would become the new parent company of CNBC upon Comcast’s planned spinoff of Versant.",

    "body": "Cheng Xin | Getty ImagesLyft customers can once again earn miles toward their next flight.The ridesharing company on Wednesday said it's partnering with United Airlines to offer MileagePlus points to riders who link their accounts, months after it ended an eight-year partnership with Delta Airlines.Once linked, riders can earn one mile for every dollar spent on Standard Priority Pickup and XL rides and two miles for every dollar booked on business profiles. Extra Comfort, Lyft Black, Black SUV and regular airport rides will earn three miles per dollar. Pre-scheduled rides to and from the airport will rake in four miles per dollar.The company said rewards do not stack. Riders get the highest value multiplier on a booking.Lyft marketing chief Brian Irving told CNBC that the partnership builds on both Lyft and United's commitment to building better customer experiences.\"We have this simple, yet really customer-obsessed way of approaching things,\" he said.Earlier this year, Delta dissolved its eight-year partnership with Lyft and brought its loyalty program to ride-hailing competitor Uber.Read more CNBC tech newsAmazon upheaval: With morale shaken, Jassy looks for next big play after mass layoffsArmis raises $435 million, valuing cybersecurity startup at $6.1 billionChinese EV maker Xpeng to launch robotaxis, humanoid robots with self-developed AI chipsTrump renominates Musk ally Jared Isaacman to run NASA months after withdrawalAirlines have been amping up loyalty programs in recent years to try and grow revenues, offering new ways for customers to earn miles.United said last month that sales from its loyalty program rose 9%.

    "body": "The Vogtle nuclear power plant is located in Burke County, near Waynesboro, Georgia in USA. Each of the two existing units have a Westinghouse pressurized water reactor (PWR), with a General Electric turbine and electric generator, producing approximately 2,400 MW of electricity. Two Westinghouse made AP 1000 reactors are under construction here.Pallava Bagla | Corbis News | Getty ImagesThe Trump administration's plan to spend tens of billions of dollars on Westinghouse nuclear plants could transform it into an independent, publicly traded company with the U.S. government as a major shareholder.The Commerce Department signed a deal last week with Westinghouse owners Cameco and Brookfield Asset Management to spend $80 billion to build the company's nuclear plants across the U.S.Under the deal, the U.S. government is granted a participation interest in Westinghouse and can require an initial public offering on or before January 2029 if the company's value surges to $30 billion or more.The government could become an 8% shareholder in Westinghouse under this scenario, said Cameco Chief Operating Officer Grant Isaac on the company's third-quarter earnings call Wednesday. It is not entitled to a stake in Cameco or Brookfield under the deal, Isaac said.Cameco would consider spinning out Westinghouse as an independent company in 2029 depending on the circumstances, the executive said.\"There is definitely a unique interest in investing just in Westinghouse,\" Isaac said. \"Cameco is a funny proxy for that. Brookfield's probably an even funnier proxy to invest in just Westinghouse.\"Cameco is one of the largest uranium miners in the world and Brookfield is one of the biggest investors in energy generation.\"We're going to keep all options on the table,\" Isaac said. \"This partnership agreement does not force us to leave Westinghouse in 2029. We don't have to sell any of our share — or we may if the value of Westinghouse is so significant come 2029 when that window opens up.\"U.S. government financingThe government's interest in Westinghouse vests only if it makes a final investment decision with definitive agreements to build new reactors in the U.S. with a total value of $80 billion.The U.S. could use tools like Department of Energy loans or financing from \"other jurisdictions\" to finance the projects among other options, Isaac said.\"We're assured that there is a lot of interest in investing this minimum $80 billion in order to begin the process,\" the executive said.Westinghouse has designed a big modern nuclear reactor called the AP1000 that the Trump administration wants to deploy across the U.S. to meet rising electricity demand from data centers and manufacturing. It generates a gigawatt of electricity, which is enough power for more than 750,000 homes.President Donald Trump signed an executive order in May that called for the U.S. to start construction on 10 large new nuclear reactors by 2030. Westinghouse CEO Dan Sumner said in July that the company would meet Trump's call with the AP1000.But Westinghouse has struggled in the past to deliver the AP1000 on time and on budget. It went bankrupt in 2017 from cost overruns at big nuclear projects in Georgia and South Carolina.The first two AP1000 reactors in the U.S. came online at Plant Vogtle in Georgia in 2023 and 2024 but the South Carolina project was canceled.Westinghouse was bought by Brookfield and Cameco in 2023, five years after it emerged from bankruptcy. Brookfield has a 51% stake in Westinghouse and Cameco owns 49% of it.The nuclear industry needs a big order of reactors to stimulate the market and supply chains, Isaac said. The U.S. government is serving that role, the executive said.\"What the U.S. government has done is committed to step in and be that stimulant if you will, their commitment is to facilitate the financing,\" he said.",

The stripped-down version of the SUV was priced at 39,990 euros for the German market -- about 5,000 euros lower than the cheapest, previously available versions of the Model Y there.It remains to be seen whether Tesla's new, lower-priced model variants can help revitalize demand for their EVs in Germany or Europe.Policy changes ahead may lift EV sales in Germany, overall.Germany scrapped incentives to boost purchases of fully electric vehicles about two years ago, a policy change that led to a sharp drop in demand for fully electric vehicles, initially. The country is now poised to start up a new EV incentive program that goes into effect in January 2026, and is intended to help lower- and middle-income buyers adopt zero tailpipe emission vehicles.",

However, the platform's revenue did meet analyst estimates of $1.05 billion.\"Tariff-related weakness showed up for the first time in our digital ads universe and will reinforce PINS' lack of customer diversity for the bears and higher macro sensitivity,\" RBC wrote in an analyst note.Third-quarter sales in the U.S. and Canada came in at $786 million, lower than StreetAccount's estimates of $799 million.Pinterest finance chief Julia Donnelly said during the earnings call that the company faced \"some pockets of moderating ad spend\" in the two countries during the quarter due to unnamed \"larger U.S. retailers\" that faced pressure on their margins from tariff-related issues.Donnelly added that the company expects these trends to continue with the addition of a new tariff from President Donald Trump that will impact the home furnishings category.Several banks lowered their price targets following the earnings report, pointing to increasing competition from larger social platforms like Instagram and TikTok and concerns over macro headwinds.Citi analyst Ronald Josey noted that the company's international monetization could \"plateau or decelerate faster than expected.\"However, 81% of analysts still maintained an outperform or buy rating.

The midpoint of that range, $1.325 billion, missed Wall Street's projections of $1.34 billion.\"I did not think they were nearly as negative on the holiday season as people are making it out,\" CNBC's Jim Cramer said Wednesday on \"Squawk on the Street.\" \"They are very muted.

But it is absolutely likely, we believe, that as chatbots ramp up advertising and content for consumers with commercial intent, that Pinterest's wheelhouse will become their wheelhouse.\"Bank of America analyst Justin Post noted that while revenues fell short, the company is continuing to post steady growth and is in \"the early stages of realizing AI-driven gains.\"Ready said in the earnings call that the company is working to integrate more AI throughout the platform, including a new feature that will curate personalized boards for users. Pinterest also rolled out an AI-powered personal shopping assistant at the end of October.\"Our investments in AI and product innovation are paying off,\" Ready said in a statement. \"We've become a leader in visual search and have effectively turned our platform into an AI-powered shopping assistant for 600 million consumers.\"watch now",

    "description": "Dr. Sidrah Nisar was both excited and overwhelmed to land a $125,000 salary right out of veterinary school in 2019.\"I had more money than I could hand",
    "body": "Dr. Sidrah Nisar was both excited and overwhelmed to land a $125,000 salary right out of veterinary school in 2019.\"I had more money than I could handle,\" she tells CNBC Make It.Little did she know, she would soon be more than doubling that annual income by switching from full-time positions to contract work as a relief vet. Nisar's sister, who's also a vet, introduced her to an app called Roo that connects vets to clinics in need of coverage. Nisar started picking up shifts through Roo in May 2023 and left her full-time job in September of that year.\"I love being a relief veterinarian because I get to meet new people, talk to new people, learn new things every time I go into a new hospital,\" she says.In her full-time positions, Nisar worked 40 to 50 hours a week. Now, she works 50 to 60 hours a week, but on a schedule she can dictate, and with higher hourly rates. In 2024, Nisar earned $366,000 from shifts she picked up on Roo. She earned an additional $18,000 as a brand ambassador for Roo, plus another $2,000 from vet shifts she picked up outside of Roo to bring her total income for the year up to $386,000.Vets on Roo earn nearly twice as much per hour as the average full-time vet, and on average make $1,266 per day, the company says. Working full-time hours at that rate would easily help vets make more than the median $125,510 a year veterinarians nationwide earn, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data.Still, contract positions like the relief vet work Nisar does aren't for everyone. Here are three of the main differences to consider.1. Pay consistencyWhile a full-time position may come with rigid time-off policies or daily schedules, it also comes with a regular paycheck. Losing that guaranteed pay is \"the one setback of being a relief veterinarian,\" Nisar says.\"With being a relief vet, you kind of always have to be hustling and looking for work.\"Nisar credits the Roo app with making it easier to find shifts that work for her, but acknowledges the possibility that there could be a time when she struggles to find enough shifts to meet her financial obligations. For now, Roo has a lot of hospitals available in Nisar's area, \"so that's never a significant worry of mine,\" she says. 2. Work-life balanceWhen she worked full-time in animal hospitals, Nisar says she was \"consistently just thinking about my job when I wasn't at work.\"That quickly changed when she switched to relief work. Since she works at a number of different hospitals and may not return to some, Nisar is better able to separate what's happening at work from her personal life.\"My work-life balance has definitely changed since becoming a relief veterinarian,\" she says. \"I definitely am able to leave work at work and I don't bring it home with me versus being a full time vet.\"Like any workplace, drama and interpersonal conflicts can arise at animal hospitals where employees see each other every day and develop close relationships, for better or worse. As a relief vet, Nisar is largely able to stay out of any issues that can come up, or can choose not to return to hospitals where she doesn't enjoy working with the staff. \"[It's] significantly less stress,\" she says. \"When you're doing relief [shifts] you go in, you do your work, and then you leave.\"3. Mentorship opportunitiesWhile Nisar is happier doing relief work than she was in full-time positions, she doesn't recommend it for veterinarians just getting out of school because they still have a lot to learn that likely won't come as easily if they're bouncing from clinic to clinic.\"Doing that full time job and learning from your mentor is very, very important,\" she says. \"My advice to new vets is to do your full-time job first and having a mentor there and then stepping into relief [work] if that's something that you feel that would suit you best.\"And for experienced vets, Nisar says relief work still isn't right for everyone and you \"have to have a certain personality\" to be successful. \"You are going into a brand new clinic most of the time and you're meeting new people,\" she says. \"You have to be patient. You have to be flexible because you're doing what they want you to do. You're there to help them.\"Want to level up your AI skills? Sign up for Smarter by CNBC Make It's new online course, How To Use AI To Communicate Better At Work.

    "body": "Brad Garlinghouse, CEO of Ripple, speaks at the 2022 Milken Institute Global Conference in Beverly Hills, California, U.S., May 4, 2022. Mike Blake | ReutersDigital assets and infrastructure company Ripple said Wednesday it has raised $500 million in funding, lifting its valuation to $40 billion.The fundraise comes after a slew of acquisitions and as the company expands its product base beyond just payments.Crypto and digital asset companies are trying to take advantage of what is seen by the industry as a more favorable environment in the U.S. after the election of President Donald Trump and the passing of a landmark stablecoin law known as the GENIUS Act.Ripple, which is closely linked to the XRP cryptocurrency, said the funding round was led by funds managed by affiliates of Fortress Investment Group, affiliates of Citadel Securities, Pantera Capital, Galaxy Digital, Brevan Howard, and Marshall Wace.'Record year of growth'\"The decision to accept $500 million in new common equity reflects the strategic value of deepening relationships with financial partners whose expertise complements Ripple's expanding global suite of products,\" Ripple said, adding that it is continuing its \"record year of growth.\"Monica Long, president of Ripple, told CNBC in an interview on Wednesday that the company did not need to raise any money, but had seen demand from institutional investors who wanted to get a share of the company.\"We think it makes good sense to have them as strategic partners, as investors who will have a hand toward building the future\" Long said.Ripple has looked to position itself as a fintech firm bringing crypto and digital assets technology to institutional clients.When Ripple launched in 2012, the company initially focused on using blockchain technology to facilitate cross-border payments. The token XRP was used to move fiat currencies quickly.Since then, Ripple has bolstered its payments business and expanded into new areas through aggressive acquisitions. In just over two years, Ripple said it has completed six acquisitions.Last year, the company launched its own stablecoin, a type of digital currency pegged to the U.S. dollar and backed by real-world assets. Stablecoins are seen as a key way to move money quickly around the world as they can operate 24 hours a day. This year, Ripple acquired an enterprise-focused stablecoin platform called Rail.Beyond payments, Ripple has pushed into other lines of business, including custody of crypto assets, prime brokerage and corporate treasury management.Long said the company's acquisition strategy was focused on companies that will complement Ripple's core payments business, or allow it to push into new areas.\"We will continue to look at where new opportunities arise in those two things,\" Long said.While other crypto-focused companies such as Circle have gone public, Long said this is not on the radar for Ripple right now.\"We are really pleased to see crypto companies going public, that is great for our overall industry continuing to mature,\" Long said.\"We are not focused on an IPO right now. We have the balance sheet, the liquidity to be growing and making moves on M&A and other big strategic partnerships. We will continue to remain private.\"Ripple's funding comes as cryptocurrency markets remain volatile. This week, bitcoin fell below the $100,000 mark for the first time since June, with billions of dollars being wiped off the overall market.",

    "body": "watch nowThe head of the air traffic controllers' union said Wednesday that it could take the industry \"weeks to recover\" from the impacts of the government shutdown.Nick Daniels, president of the National Air Traffic Controllers Association, said on CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" that the holiday season will be especially affected by the shortage of air traffic controllers, who missed their first full paycheck last week. The Department of Transportation has reported increased delays and ground stops as a result of the shutdown, now in its fifth consecutive week.\"To somehow fathom we could go into the holiday season still in a government shutdown, I can't even begin to predict what the impacts will be across this country,\" Daniels said. \"Three-hour TSA wait lines will be the least of our worries.\"The FAA Air Traffic Control tower at Newark Liberty International Airport (EWR) in Newark, New Jersey, US, on Monday, Nov. 3, 2025. Michael Nagle | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesAir traffic controllers and airport security screeners are among the employees required to work during the shutdown as essential employees, even though they're not receiving regular paychecks. The shutdown, which entered its 36th full day on Wednesday, is now the longest in history.Even if the shutdown ended today, Daniels added, the impacts could take much longer to be seen among air traffic controllers and could pose challenges for the industry at large.\"We've been in this shutdown for so long at this point, I don't think we'll actually see the damage until well after the shutdown ends, seeing air traffic controllers resign from this career and profession,\" he said. \"Even if they open the government today, we won't see the pay that we deserve, that we've rightfully earned for over two to two and a half months.\"Read more CNBC airline newsAmerican Airlines is arriving late to the luxury travel boom.

That shutdown ended after air traffic controller shortages led to severe disruptions at U.S. airports.\"We'll do everything we can and be the professionals that show up and try to move the aircraft across the airspace — at the same time, we can't make the impossible possible if it's just going to be putting us in an impossible situation,\" Daniels said.Earlier this week, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said on \"Squawk Box\" that he may \"shut the whole airspace down\" if the shutdown continues to stretch on. The industry is currently 2,000 to 3,000 controllers short of its ideal staffing goal, he added.\"We won't let people travel, [but] we're not there at this point. It's just significant delays,\" Duffy said.",

    "body": "Starbucks baristas gather outside a Starbucks store as they protest against the company during a rally to demand a new contract in New York City, on October 28, 2025. The Starbucks Workers United is fighting for a new contract that delivers improved staffing hours, take-home pay, and on-the-job protections for baristas. (Photo by TIMOTHY A.CLARY / AFP) (Photo by TIMOTHY A.CLARY/AFP via Getty Images)          Timothy A.clary | Afp | Getty ImagesStarbucks Workers United has authorized an open-ended strike that could begin on Red Cup Day, one of the coffee chain's biggest sales days of the year, the union announced Wednesday.The union is preparing to strike in more than 25 cities if it doesn't reach a collective bargaining agreement with Starbucks by Nov. 13, when Red Cup Day falls this year. The two parties have not been in active negotiations to reach a contract after talks between them fell apart late last year. Starbucks and the union entered into mediation in February, and hundreds of barista delegates voted down the economic package Starbucks proposed in April.The strike authorization won 92% of votes, according to Starbucks Workers United.The union is pushing for improved hours, higher wages and the resolution of hundreds of unfair labor practice charges levied against Starbucks.The strike would clash with Starbucks' annual giveaway of reusable red cups bearing the company's logo with any purchase. The freebie has become a collector's item for the coffee giant's biggest fans.Without an end date in sight, the strike would also disrupt Starbucks' broader holiday season, which falls during the company's fiscal first quarter and is one of the busiest times of the year for the coffee chain. Customers flock to its cafes for seasonal drinks like its peppermint mocha, along with gift cards and other merchandise.watch nowWorkers United, which began organizing at Starbucks in 2021, says it now represents more than 12,000 workers across more than 650 stores. (The company told CNBC that the union only represents workers at 550 cafes, accounting for some store closures over time.)In a statement, Starbucks said it will be ready to serve customers across its nearly 18,000 company-operated and licensed stores this holiday season.\"We are disappointed that Workers United, who only represents around 4% of our partners, has voted to authorize a strike instead of returning to the bargaining table. When they're ready to come back, we're ready to talk,\" Starbucks spokesperson Jaci Anderson said.Starbucks said any agreement with the union needs to reflect the reality that it \"already offers the best job in retail, including more than $30 an hour on average in pay and benefits for hourly partners. The facts show people like working at Starbucks. Partner engagement is up, turnover is nearly half the industry average, and we get more than 1 million job applications a year.\"The company is in the midst of a turnaround plan under new CEO Brian Niccol, dubbed \"Back to Starbucks,\" that has begun to show momentum. Starbucks reported in its fiscal fourth quarter that its same-store sales returned to growth for the first time in nearly two years. The coffee chain's global same-store sales rose 1%, lifted by international markets. Its U.S. same-store sales were flat for the quarter but turned positive in September. Starbucks also announced a $1 billion restructuring plan in September that involves closing some 500 of its North American stores, according to analyst estimates, and laying off 900 workers in nonretail roles. ",

    "body": "watch nowCorporate America is getting rocked by historic rounds of white-collar layoffs, leading some to wonder: Has AI finally come for their jobs?While the proliferation of generative and agentic artificial intelligence is playing a role, recent job cut announcements from companies like Amazon, UPS and Target are about a lot more than just the advance of new technology. The firms, which each announced layoffs in recent weeks totaling more than 60,000 roles eliminated this year, said they're trying to cut corporate bloat, streamline operations and adjust to new business models.But in the absence of the Bureau of Labor Statistics' monthly jobs report, which has gone dark amid the government shutdown, the layoff announcements have raised questions about the strength of the labor market and if it's the start of an AI-driven, white-collar recession. Some companies have outright said they're replacing workers with AI. Klarna CEO Sebastian Siemiatkowski said in May the company was able to shrink its head count by about 40%, in part because of AI. Duolingo said in April it'll stop using contractors for work that AI can handle. Salesforce laid off 4,000 customer support roles in September, saying that AI can do 50% of the work at the company.But experts interviewed by CNBC said some companies could be \"AI-washing\" their job cuts, blaming layoffs on the new technology to cover up business fumbles and old-fashioned cost cutting.\"We spend a lot of time looking carefully at companies that are actually trying to implement AI, and there's very little evidence that it cuts jobs anywhere near like the level that we're talking about. In most cases, it doesn't cut head count at all,\" said Peter Cappelli, a professor of management at the Wharton School and director of its Center for Human Resources. \"Using AI and introducing it to save jobs turns out to be an enormously complicated and time-consuming exercise. … There's still a perception that it's simple and easy and cheap to do, and it's really not.\" Still, the cuts, which come after a string of layoffs across the tech industry, have cast a dark cloud on a teetering economy that's been wracked by persistent inflation, rising delinquencies, falling consumer sentiment and an average effective tariff rate that's at its highest level in nearly a century, according to estimates from The Budget Lab at Yale University.The growing pile of bad news has done little to shock the stock market, which is at near-record highs, but that's largely because it's been buoyed in part by AI megacaps.Cappelli attributed the recent surge in layoff announcements to concerns about the state of the economy. He also noted a likely \"bandwagon\" effect in which companies see their competitors cutting so they too start making cuts. \"If it looks like everybody is cutting, then you say, 'They must know something we don't know,'\" said Cappelli. He added investors often reward cutting: \"They want to hear that you're cutting because it looks like you're doing something good. It looks like becoming more efficient.\"To be sure, AI and automation are potentially enabling some of the cuts, and the emerging technology is poised to help all companies reduce costs and boost efficiency in the coming years. But the reasons behind each layoff and the role AI is playing are nuanced, and vary company by company.Starbucks' decision to cut around 2,000 corporate jobs in two rounds this year is related to slowing sales at the company and a larger turnaround effort led by its new CEO, Brian Niccol. Layoffs at Meta's AI unit, which impacted around 600 jobs, came as the company said it wants to operate more nimbly and reduce layers. Intel's decision to lay off about 15% of its workforce came after it overinvested in chip manufacturing without adequate demand. Together, they represent what John Challenger, CEO of job placement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas, described as a turning point in the economy and job market.\"We were in this no-hire, no-fire, type of zone. Economy was moving ahead. The labor markets were feeling pressure, but certainly, unemployment had stayed relatively strong,\" he said. \"These job cuts do suggest that the dam may be breaking as the economy slows.\"The earliest signals, he said, could be coming from retail, shipping and distribution.The world's largest startup  During the Covid-19 pandemic, Amazon went on a hiring spree in part to meet a surge in demand for e-commerce and cloud computing services, leading its corporate and front-line workforces to more than double to 1.3 million employees between 2019 and 2020. By 2021, the company had swelled to 1.6 million employees globally, the same year Andy Jassy succeeded Jeff Bezos as CEO. Since taking over, Jassy has been trying to undo some of that work.Last week's layoff announcement, impacting 14,000 corporate jobs, is expected to be the largest in the company's history and to affect nearly every unit in the company. It marks Amazon's second round of layoffs in three years and amounts to more than 41,000 corporate job cuts since 2022, with more potentially on the way come 2026.Though AI is part of the picture, there's more at work behind the reductions.Jassy said in the days following the announcement that the changes were neither AI nor financially driven, but were instead to cut corporate fat so the company can operate as the world's largest startup.Amazon said it's not replacing workers with AI, at least not yet, but it does need to cut employees so it can invest in the technology. As those costs come down, Amazon has earmarked hefty investments in cloud infrastructure to support AI workloads while simultaneously pushing out a flurry of AI services and tools across the company. It's contributed to a rise in capital expenditures, which are now expected to reach $125 billion this year, up from a prior forecast of $118 billion.Jassy said previously that the company's workforce would shrink in the future as a result of its embrace of generative AI but it still plans to keep hiring in \"key strategic areas.\" Over time, the company will need \"fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today\" but \"more people doing other types of jobs,\" Jassy said in June. The cuts are also part of a larger goal of Jassy's to make the company more nimble, reduce bureaucracy and remove layers so it can operate faster and smarter. \"It's culture,\" Jassy said during Amazon's quarterly earnings call Thursday. \"If you grow as fast as we did for several years, you know, the size of the businesses, the number of people, the number of locations, the types of businesses you're in, you end up with a lot more people than what you had before, and you end up with a lot more layers.\"Smart money In January, UPS announced a major change in its strategy.The logistics firm said it was going to pare down its relationship with its largest customer, Amazon, in favor of higher-margin businesses that require fewer people to operate. In fiscal 2024, Amazon shipments represented nearly 12% of revenue for UPS. The logistics giant said it was planning to reduce that volume by more than half by June because of the relatively low margins.\"This was not their ask. This was us. This was UPS taking control of our destiny,\" CEO Carol Tomé told analysts in January. In turn, UPS said it was pivoting to more profitable businesses, like health care, returns and business-to-business services and as a result, would require fewer resources. \"As we bring volume down, we will not only reduce the hours of miles associated with this volume, we will be able to take out fixed costs to match our capacity to our new expected volume levels,\" finance chief Brian Dykes said in January. \"We expect to close up to 10% of our building, cut back our vehicle and aircraft fleets and reduce labor.\" Last week the company said it had deepened previously planned job cuts for a total of 48,000 roles eliminated so far this year across operational employees and office workers.In the first half of 2025, parcel volumes were down 5.4% at UPS compared with the year-ago period, according to data from ShipMatrix, and the company has been changing its corporate structure to adjust to lower volume.The bulk of its layoffs this year, representing 34,000 operational jobs, were related to its decision to close 93 buildings – not replace people with robotics, the company said. The 14,000 additional corporate roles it cut were partially related to AI, but the technology was not the primary driver, a spokesperson said. Where AI and automation are expected to hit UPS most is in its future hiring plans.As the company plans to bring automation to more of its facilities, it won't need to hire as many people. Last week, UPS said 66% of its volume during the fourth quarter would come through automated facilities, up from 63% a year prior. That number is expected to move higher in the years ahead. Still, that doesn't necessarily mean those jobs are disappearing – some could be migrating from UPS to other companies, said Jason Miller, a professor of supply chain management at Michigan State University's business school.Miller said there's a \"reallocation\" effect happening where one firm is losing business and shedding payroll — while another is gaining. The number of jobs may be the same, but the location, qualities and duties can differ, he said. BLS data on the number of people employed in \"courier\" positions, which covers roles at places like UPS and Amazon, reflects that trend. As of August, courier positions were only down about 2% from their all-time high, and they've been on the rise over the last three years, the data shows. When tariffs bite Target's announcement last month that it would be cutting 1,800 jobs, representing about 8% of its corporate workforce, is a window into both consumer spending and the retailer's own specific challenges. It's Target's first major round of layoffs in a decade and comes after four years of roughly stagnant revenue. The retailer's incoming CEO, Michael Fiddelke, said the cuts are about reducing complexity at a company that's seen its workforce grow faster than sales. Unlike some of its competitors, the bulk of Target's revenue comes from the kinds of products that are nice to have, but not necessary, such as holiday mugs, trendy sweaters and home decor. That means when consumer spending starts to slow down, Target feels it more acutely than its rival Walmart, which earns the majority of its revenue from groceries. Slower consumer spending has been partially to blame for a decline in Target's performance in recent years, but the introduction of tariffs, which are pushing prices higher, could make that impact even worse. \"Buyers' willingness to pay is staying flat, inflation is high, income isn't going very up so firms' ability to sort of increase price to maintain their margin is being squeezed,\" said Daniel Keum, an associate professor of management at Columbia Business School, who studies labor market dynamics. \"If you can't increase price, you have to reduce cost.\"How operationally do I manage cost?\" Keum added. \"I mean No. 1, like, let's lay off white-collar people.\" Outside of macroeconomic conditions, Target's business has also suffered from a number of self-inflicted challenges. The quality of its merchandise has taken a dive, fewer staff and frequent out-of-stocks have made its stores less enjoyable to shop in, customers and insiders told CNBC earlier this year. The retailer has also struggled to manage its inventory, which has impacted its profitability. All of these issues combined have left Target with a workforce that has grown faster than sales and a complex corporate structure that has hampered decision-making and created needless red tape. Between fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2024, Target's global workforce grew 6% from 415,000 employees to 440,000, but in the same time period, sales declined 0.8%, according to company filings. \"The truth is, the complexity we've created over time has been holding us back,\" Fiddelke told Target employees in a memo when announcing the job cuts. \"Too many layers and overlapping work have slowed decisions, making it harder to bring ideas to life.\"He didn't cite AI in his memo but did say the cuts will help the company execute faster so it can better \"accelerate technology.\" — CNBC's Melissa Repko and Steve Liesman contributed to this report.",

    "body": "Sam Altman, chief executive officer of OpenAI Inc., during a media tour of the Stargate AI data center in Abilene, Texas, US, on Tuesday, Sept. 23, 2025.Kyle Grillot | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesWith OpenAI's recent release of its AI browser, the historic level of capital expenditures  being made in the current AI arms race may accelerate even further, if that is possible. From the reciprocal, and some have said circular, nature of hundreds of billions in  commitments in investment, tied to future chip purchases, to the extent to which GDP growth is reliant on this boom, some have said this is a bubble. A Harvard economist estimates  92% of US GDP growth in the first half of 2025 was due to investment in AI. But much more needs to be understood about the connection between the breakneck investment in AI and the business models that underpins the entire economy: the advertising technology (Ad Tech) industrial complex. For the past 25 years the infrastructure of the internet has been engineered to extract  advertising revenue. Search Engine Marketing, the advertising business model at the core of Google, is perhaps the greatest business model of all time. Meta's advertising  business, based on engagement and attribution, is a close second. And right behind  both of these is Amazon's advertising business, powered by its position as the largest  online retailer. While a smaller portion of Amazon's topline, its highly profitable  advertising business makes up a disproportionate percentage of Amazon's profits. So much so that nearly every major retailer has spun up their own version of retail media networks, all driving significantly to the bottom lines and market capitalization of massive companies like Walmart, Kroger, Uber (and UberEats), Doordash and many more. In fact, these platforms have been using AI to refine their advertising business models for years, in the form of algorithmic models that powered their search and recommendation engines, and to increase engagement and better predict purchase decision, seeking an ever-greater share of all commerce, not just what is typically thought of as \"advertising.\" These three multi-trillion-dollar market cap companies either wholly, or substantially, derive their profits from advertising. And now they are using some portion of those historically profitable advertising revenues to fuel infrastructure investments at a level the world has not seen outside of War Time spending by governments.But at the same time, the latest wave of AI has the potential to disrupt the very same trillions in market cap that is fueling it. AI will, without question, change how people search (Google), shop (Amazon) and are entertained (Meta). Answers delivered without clicking around the web. AI-assisted shopping. Infinite personalized content creation.If AI represents such a potential existential risk, why are Google, Meta and Amazon such a huge part of the current arms race to invest in AI? The \"moonshot\" outcome of would be that achieving Artificial General Intelligence, or Super Intelligence, AI that can do anything a human can, but better, would unlock so much value that it would dwarf any investment.But there is more immediate urgency to protect, or disrupt, the advertising business model fueling the trillions in market cap and hundreds of billions of current investment, before someone else does. While the seminal paper that launched this phase of AI, \"Attention is All You Need\" was written by mostly Google researchers, it was OpenAI and Microsoft, and now Grok as well, that launched the current AI arms race. And they are not remotely as dependent on the current advertising industrial complex. In fact, Sam Altman has called the feeds of the major platforms using AI to maximize advertising dollars, \"the first at-scale misaligned AIs.\" He is clearly stating which businesses he believes OpenAI is trying to disrupt.What comes next?This time is different, but it also comes with different risks. The major difference with the current fever in infrastructure investment vs the dotcom bubble of 2000, is that in large part the companies funding it are among the most profitable companies in the world. And so far, there has not been indications of cracks in the business model of advertising that is both funding their investments, and their market capitalizations (along with so many massive companies people wouldn't think about being in the advertising business).But if AI does disrupt, or even break, the current advertising model, the shock to the economy and markets would be far greater than most could imagine.Google, Meta and Amazon are still best positioned to create new business models, and as mentioned, have been using AI for far longer to support their advertising business models with great success. However, fundamentally changing the way people interface with search, commerce and content online will require just that, entirely new revenue models, maybe, hopefully, some that are aligned, that are not advertising based. But whatever the model, perhaps it is helpful to consider that the justification in AI infrastructure spending may not be to just unlock new revenue, but to protect the business models that make up a much more significant portion of the market capitalization of public companies than most people are aware.",

    "body": "watch nowMcDonald's on Wednesday fell short of Wall Street's earnings expectations, but the company's U.S. restaurants reported better-than-expected same-store sales growth.CEO Chris Kempczinski said in a statement that the third-quarter results are \"a testament to our ability to deliver sustainable growth even in a challenging environment.\"For more than a year, McDonald's, long considered a bellwether for the financial health of consumers, has been sounding the alarm about a pullback in restaurant spending, particularly from low-income diners. That downturn continued during the third quarter.\"We continue to see a bifurcated consumer base with [quick-service restaurant] traffic from lower-income consumers declining nearly double digits in the third quarter, a trend that's persisted for nearly two years,\" Kempczinski said on the company's conference call. \"In contrast, QSR traffic growth among higher-income consumers remains strong, increasing nearly double digits in the quarter.\"He added that McDonald's is projecting that the pressure on consumers' financial health will continue well into 2026.Shares of the company rose more than 3% in morning trading.Here's what the company reported compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:Earnings per share: $3.22 adjusted vs. $3.33 expectedRevenue: $7.08 billion vs. $7.1 billion expectedThe fast-food giant reported third-quarter net income of $2.28 billion, or $3.18 per share, up from $2.26 billion, or $3.13 per share, a year earlier. McDonald's saw a higher effective tax rate during the quarter, which weighed on its earnings.Excluding restructuring charges and other items, the burger chain earned $3.22 per share.Revenue rose 3% to $7.08 billion.A McDonald's restaurant is viewed on July 22, 2024 in Burbank, California.Mario Tama | Getty ImagesThe company's same-store sales increased 3.6%, a reversal from the year-ago period's decline of 1.5% and roughly in line with Wall Street's expectations, according to StreetAccount.In the United States, McDonald's same-store sales rose 2.4%, topping StreetAccount estimates of 1.9%. The company credited growth in average check, suggesting that diners are paying more for their meals despite the ongoing \"value wars\" between fast-food chains.In an appeal to budget-conscious consumers, McDonald's brought back its Snack Wraps for the first time in nine years and priced them at $2.99. CFO Ian Borden said it was one of the most popular chicken launches in recent history in the U.S., with nearly 1 in 5 customers purchasing a Snack Wrap in the first four weeks.And in September, the chain reintroduced Extra Value Meals, which it last promoted before the Covid-19 pandemic. Executives said that McDonald's value offerings have helped the chain gain market share with high-income diners.\"I think sometimes there's this idea that value only matters to low-income [consumers],\" Kempczinski said. \"But value matters to everybody, whether you're upper income, middle income, lower income, feeling like you're getting good value for your dollar is important.\"Outside of the U.S., McDonald's saw even stronger same-store sales growth. Its international operated markets division, which includes Australia and Canada, reported a 4.3% increase in same-store sales.\"The value platforms we've had in place for several quarters in our IOM markets are resonating with our customers and continuing to improve value and affordability scores,\" Kempczinski said.And McDonald's international developmental licensed markets segment saw its same-store sales grow 4.7%, lifted by demand in Japan.Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, the company is projecting stronger U.S. same-store sales growth, fueled by the return of McDonald's Monopoly and the Extra Value Meals. The chain is also facing easy comparisons to last year's fourth quarter, when an E. coli outbreak weighed on its domestic sales.However, the company's international divisions may see same-store sales growth slow next quarter as the two segments face tougher comparisons, Borden said.Correction: McDonald's priced its new Snack Wraps at $2.99. A previous version of this story misstated the price.",

Stephen Cohen | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesA UPS cargo plane crashed shortly after taking off from Louisville Muhammad Ali International Airport in Kentucky at around 5:15 p.m. local time Tuesday, the Federal Aviation Administration said.At least nine people were killed, Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear said Wednesday. \"Right now these families need prayers, love and support,\" he said. \"Let's wrap our arms around them during this unimaginable time.\"In a Wednesday news conference, Beshear said he was \"fairly confident\" that the death toll would rise by \"at least one\" and that he expects more details in the afternoon. He said six to seven people outside of the crew were injured, and the plane hit two of the \"lesser populated\" businesses in the area.Beshear also urged residents and businesses around the crash site to not drink water and declared a state of emergency for Kentucky.\"It allows us to move resources more quickly through emergency management and the Kentucky National Guard,\" Beshear said. \"It allows state resources to be used also.\"In an earlier news conference Tuesday, he also said 11 people were injured in the incident, some of them significantly. He said at the time that he expected those numbers to rise.UPS said in a statement that there were three crew members on the plane. Beshear said the status of the crew was unknown. He added that there was an emergency response area set up for families.The reason for the crash was not immediately known. The plane was a MD-11F, a type of freight transport aircraft made by manufacturer McDonnell Douglas, which merged with Boeing in 1997. The plane had about 38,000 gallons of fuel on board to travel all the way to Honolulu, officials said.The Louisville Metro Police Department implemented a shelter-in-place order near the crash site Tuesday. Several businesses close to the area were affected, officials said.There was no hazardous material on the plane that would cause an environmental issue, but the place where it crashed \"could create those types of situations,\" Beshear said. He said a petroleum recycling business and an auto parts business are in the area and called it an \"all-hands on deck response.\"A large plume of black smoke was visible near the airport, and footage from local TV showed fire and debris in a large radius around the crash site.Smoke rises from the site of a UPS cargo plane crash near the UPS Worldport at Louisville Muhammad Ali International Airport in Louisville, Kentucky, on November 4, 2025.

It reopened one runway Wednesday morning, and the airport encouraged travelers to monitor their flight status for delays or cancellations.UPS has its headquarters in Atlanta but the Louisville airport is home to its UPS Worldport, which the company says is its largest package handling facility in the world.\"We are terribly saddened by the accident tonight in Louisville. Our heartfelt thoughts are with everyone involved. UPS is committed to the safety of our employees, our customers and the communities we serve,\" the company said in a statement. \"This is particularly true in Louisville, home to our airline and thousands of UPSers.\"Hundreds of UPS flights take off daily from Louisville, according to the company. UPS noted late Tuesday that it has halted package sorting operations at the facility.\"This is a UPS town,\" said Louisville city council member Betsy Ruhe.— CNBC's Dennis Green and Laya Neelakandan contributed to this report.",

Andrew Cuomo, who had been endorsed by Trump.Trump told the Miami crowd on Wednesday afternoon, \"We lost a little bit of sovereignty last night in New York, but we'll take care of it. Don't worry about it.\"Near the end of the speech, Trump said he may try to work with Mamdani, though he has previously threatened to cut funding to New York City if its voters elected the Democrat.\"Now let's see how a communist does in New York. We're going to see how that works out. We'll help him. We want New York to be successful. We'll help him a little bit, maybe,\" Trump said in Miami.'I don't think it was good for Republicans'Hours earlier, Trump conceded that the Democrats' electoral sweep up and down the ballot on Tuesday night spelled bad news for his Republican Party.\"Last night, it was, you know, not expected to be a victory, it was very Democrat areas, but I don't think it was good for Republicans,\" Trump said during a breakfast meeting with GOP senators at the White House on Wednesday morning.\"I'm not sure it was good for anybody,\" Trump said. \"But we had an interesting evening, and we learned a lot, and we're going to talk about that.\"Trump added: \"If you read the pollsters, the shutdown was a big factor, negative for the Republicans, and that was a big factor.\"\"And they say that I wasn't on the ballot, was the, the biggest factor,\" he said.Trump's reference to the government shutdown, which is now the longest in U.S. history, suggests he believes that the stalemate in the Senate is a political liability for the GOP.Read more CNBC politics coverageDemocrats win big on Election Night in key racesZohran Mamdani wins New York City mayor's race, NBC News projectsDemocratic candidate Mikie Sherrill wins New Jersey governor's race, NBC News projectsDemocrats win Virginia governor, attorney general races, NBC News projectsSNAP update: Trump admin will pay 50% of food stamp benefits in November amid shutdownTrump says he has 'no idea who' Binance's CZ is after pardoning himTrump backtracks on attending Supreme Court tariffs case argumentsRecent polls show more Americans blame Trump and Republicans for the shutdown, which has caused mass furloughs of government workers and threatened the funding for a slew of federal services.Trump stressed at the breakfast meeting, \"We must get the government back open soon, and really immediately.\"He went on to urge Republicans to terminate the Senate filibuster in order to end the shutdown and force through his policy agenda.Mamdani's victory was one of many Democratic electoral wins in the first off-year election cycle since Trump began his second term as president.Democratic candidates Abigail Spanberger and Mikie Sherrill delivered resounding wins in their respective gubernatorial races in Virginia and New Jersey, with both projected to notch double-digit margins of victory.Jay Jones, the Democrat running for Virginia attorney general, defeated his incumbent rival, overcoming a major scandal involving texts he sent in 2022 musing about violence against a Republican political foe.After reporters and news cameras were ushered out of the breakfast Wednesday morning, Trump said that the electoral drubbing showed Republicans are \"getting killed\" and that the shutdown has been \"worse for us than for them,\" Punchbowl News reported.In his Miami speech hours later, Trump slammed the \"reckless Democrat shutdown.\"Publicly, some Republican leaders have brushed off the election results.\"What happened last night was blue states and blue cities voted blue. We all saw that coming,\" House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., said Wednesday morning. \"And no one should read too much into last night's election results. Off-year elections are not indicative of what's to come.\"Vice President JD Vance in an X post said he believes \"it's idiotic to overreact to a couple of elections in blue states.\"But Republicans \"have to do better at turning out voters,\" Vance wrote. And they must \"focus on the home front,\" he added, emphasizing the issue of affordability, a key refrain for Mamdani and other Democratic candidates.Trump's initial reaction to the electoral results, which came as the votes were still trickling in Tuesday night, was to claim that his party underperformed because he wasn't on the ballot, and because of the shutdown.\"'TRUMP WASN'T ON THE BALLOT, AND SHUTDOWN, WERE THE TWO REASONS THAT REPUBLICANS LOST ELECTIONS TONIGHT,' according to Pollsters,\" Trump wrote in a Truth Social post. He did not provide a link to those polls.Trump, in follow-up posts, reiterated his recent demand that top Republicans move to eliminate the Senate filibuster, which requires 60 votes to pass most legislation, rather than a simple majority.\"REPUBLICANS, TERMINATE THE FILIBUSTER! GET BACK TO PASSING LEGISLATION AND VOTER REFORM!\" he wrote.Republican leaders have long opposed taking that step, known as the \"nuclear option,\" for fear that a future Democratic congressional majority would wield that power aggressively.But Trump wants them to nuke the filibuster in order to quickly reopen the government and enact more of his policy agenda, including passing sweeping changes to federal voting laws.He emphasized that view at the breakfast Wednesday morning.\"If you don't terminate the filibuster, you'll be in bad shape. We won't pass any legislation,\" he said.",

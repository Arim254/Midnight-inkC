    "body": "Russian President Vladimir Putin is welcomed by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi upon arrival at the Palam Air Base in New Delhi, India December 4, 2025. Grigory Sysoev | Via ReutersRussian President Vladimir Putin has underlined Moscow's willingness to provide \"uninterrupted shipments of fuel\" to India, as the U.S. pressures New Delhi to give up importing their oil. Putin made the offer during a joint address with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday, part of his first visit to the country since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, which triggered widespread sanctions.The sanctions forced Russia to seek new customers for its exports. India has become the second biggest buyer of Russian crude oil, after China, with a report Finland-based Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air showing India bought 38% of Russian crude exports in October.In October, President Donald Trump sanctioned two of Russia's largest oil companies, Rosneft and Lukoil. This followed a tariff of 25% on India for buying Russian oil in August. But India has to walk a tightrope because it has close ties to the U.S. while also relying on Russia for fuel and access to military hardware.Putin questioned U.S. pressure on India in an interview to an Indian television channel on Thursday.The United States still buys nuclear fuel from Russia for its own nuclear power plants, Putin said in the interview, adding: \"If the U.S. has the right to buy our fuel, why shouldn't India have the same privilege?\" While Trump has acknowledged that India has cut back its Russian oil imports, experts told CNBC that this may be a temporary trend. watch nowApart from crude oil, Russia's Rosatom is also delivering reactors and reportedly fuel for India's Kudankulam nuclear power plant in Tamil Nadu, which has a combined capacity of 6000MW. India and Russia have an energy partnership, the Russian president said, adding that Moscow had been is reliable supplier of \"oil, gas, coal and everything that is required for the development of India's energy\".Last month, India announced a \"historic deal\" with Washington, in which Indian state-owned oil companies signed a one-year deal to import around 2.2 million tonnes per annum of liquefied petroleum gas from the U.S.",

    "body": "Jodie Foster, Billie Perkins, and Robert De Niro perform a scene in Taxi Driver directed by Martin Scorsese in 1976 in New York, New York.  Michael Ochs Archives | Moviepix | Getty ImagesIn the dwindling days of the California gold rush, the wife of a local miner faced a problem. Her husband's denim work pants kept ripping, so her tailor, Jacob Davis, had the idea to add copper rivets to key points of strain, like the pocket corners and the base of the button fly, to keep them from tearing. Davis' \"riveted pants\" soon became a roaring success and, unbeknownst to him at the time, marked the official birth of the blue jean, a garment that would transform fashion and come to represent the United States around the globe. \"It really has democratized American fashion and it also is the greatest export that we have sent to the world, because people identify jeans specifically with American Western culture,\" said Shawn Grain Carter, a fashion professor at the Fashion Institute of Technology in New York. \"It doesn't matter your economic or social class. It doesn't matter what your views are in terms of the political spectrum. Everybody wears denim.\" Jacob DavisCourtesy: Levi Strauss & Co.These days, denim is a major sales driver for retailers big and small, as the global denim market reached $101 billion this year, up 28% from 2020, according to data from market research company Euromonitor International. Major apparel companies from American Eagle to Levi Strauss are in a race to corner that market, leaning on A-list celebrities like Sydney Sweeney and Beyonce to win over shoppers and drive sales in an unsteady economy.But if it weren't for Levi Strauss, founder of the eponymous blue jeans company, Davis' invention may not have gone far beyond the railroad town where it was created in the early 1870s. How Levi's created blue jeansSoon after Davis created his riveted pants, called \"waist overalls\" or \"overalls\" at the time, they began selling like \"hot cakes\" and he needed a business partner to secure a patent, said Tracey Panek, Levi's in-house historian. So he wrote to Strauss, a Bavarian-born immigrant who was running a successful wholesale business in San Francisco and had supplied Davis the denim he used to create his riveted pants. \"The secret of them Pents is the Rivits that I put in those Pockets and I found the demand so large that I cannot make them up fast enough,\" Davis wrote Strauss in a letter, according to PBS. Levi StraussCourtesy: Levi Strauss & Co.Strauss, an \"astute\" businessman, recognized the opportunity and agreed to partner with Davis, said Panek. \"This would have been the first time that Levi was actually\" manufacturing his own products, said Panek. \"He was no longer just importing and selling other people's goods. He was manufacturing himself and selling to retailers.\"On May 20, 1873, the two men secured a patent for the riveted pants and eventually opened a factory on Fremont Street, close to the modern-day Salesforce tower in San Francisco's financial district. They promised to offer workers the most durable jeans on the market and soon, business was booming. Dude ranch duds and the American worker Through Strauss' connections as a wholesaler, the company's riveted overalls soon spread across the U.S., becoming the garment of choice for working men everywhere: miners, cowboys, farmers – any role that required durable clothing. Jeans were exclusively reserved for work settings at the time, but as emerging denim manufacturers vied for a similar customer base, they looked to expand their assortment to drive sales. \"Slowly and steadily into the 20th century, you start to see some of these manufacturers making variations,\" said Sonya Abrego, a New York City-based fashion historian. \"There was this one design called spring bottom pants that was kind of a more form fitted, a more dressed up, a slightly flared, maybe what the factory foreman would be wearing, right? As opposed to just the guy on the shop floor.\"In 1934, Levi created the first ever line of jeans for women. Around that time, denim started to become more popular in settings outside of work, primarily for activities like dude ranch vacations, camping and horseback riding. \"So they were kind of taking on a cowboy's garment or a worker's garment but wearing it in a … resort setting,\" said Abrego. Courtesy: Levi Strauss & Co. Dude ranch vacations had become popular because there were finally highways connecting different parts of the country, and few were willing to venture to Europe during a war. Companies like Levi began releasing advertisements highlighting their denim as \"dude ranch duds\" and \"authentic western riding wear\" to capture shoppers looking for jeans to bring with them on vacation, according to archival advertisements from the time. These cultural moments helped to expand denim beyond workers, but jeans didn't become widespread casual attire until after World War II, when American fashion overall started to shift. The rise of the backyard BBQ By the time World War II ended, the mighty American consumer was beginning to emerge. For years, Americans had been forced to ration common goods like rubber, sugar and meat while simultaneously being encouraged to save their money by buying war bonds and socking away spare cash.When the country shifted from wartime to peacetime, Americans were ready to splurge and soon began spending big on new cars, appliances and clothes. \"With a little bit more money to spend, you start seeing a bigger push for leisure clothes and fun clothes and play clothes, clothes to wear to backyard barbecues,\" said Abrego. \"Clothes that we would consider today as just like casual style.\" Courtesy: Levi Strauss & Co.Slowly and surely, it became more and more acceptable for both men and women to wear jeans outside of work settings. Then, denim manufacturers made a push to allow jeans in schools. \"They wanted to sell to as many people as they possibly could,\" said Abrego. \"The idea that jeans are good for school means that they're good for every day.\"By the time the 1960s hit, denim manufacturers had expanded their products and were selling a wide variety of colors, fits and styles. It became a symbol of the hippie movement and a mainstay on Hollywood sets. Soon, denim was everywhere, and the 1970s brought the iconic bell bottom pants and the first iteration of the \"designer jean\" — denim pants being produced by labels and brands whose designs had nothing to do with work wear or western wear, like Calvin Klein and Gloria Vanderbilt. Since then, denim has remained a constant in global fashion. While silhouettes, washes and fits have changed over time, jeans never really go out of style, which is what makes them so enduring, said Abrego. \"This is a design from 1873 … do we see anything else from 1873 on the street? It's kind of wild if you think about it that way,\" said Abrego. \"We can talk about all the details, all the changes in manufacturing and all the different fits and finishes but it's a recognizable thing, it's still a pair of jeans. For me as a historian, that continuity is so compelling because I can't really name anything else that has stayed the same to this degree.\" ",

    "body": "watch nowA key inflation measure was lower than expected in September, the Commerce Department said Friday in a report delayed by the government shutdown that gives a further green light for the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates.The core personal consumption expenditures price index, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, indicated a 0.2% monthly rise while the annual rate was 2.8%. The monthly rate was in line with the Dow Jones consensus, but the annual level was 0.1 percentage point lower. The core annual rate edged down from 2.9% in August.In addition, headline PCE increased 0.3% for the month, putting the annual inflation rate also at 2.8%, according to the department's Bureau of Economic Analysis. Both of those readings were in line with expectations though the annual rate was up 0.1 percentage point from August.Federal Reserve officials use the PCE price index as their primary policy tool for inflation. While officials look at both measures, they generally consider core a better indicator of longer-term inflation trends.\"The slightly stale September inflation report shows that prices remained reasonably stable despite tariffs and healthy consumer spending. This probably provides further air cover for the Fed to cut rates in December,\" said Scott Helfstein, Global X's head of investment strategy.Goods prices surged 0.5% on the month as President Donald Trump's tariffs continue to work their way through the economy. Services prices were up just 0.2%. Food rose 0.4% while energy was up 1.7%.The report also showed the personal savings rate was unchanged from August at 4.7%.The release was put off several weeks by the government shutdown, which had caused a halt to all data collection and economic reports.In addition to the inflation figures, the release provided information on income and spending.Personal income rose 0.4% on the month while spending was up 0.3%. Income was 0.1 percentage point above the forecast, while spending was 0.1 percentage point below the forecast.Stocks added to gains following the release as traders anticipate a quarter percentage point interest rate cut from the Fed when it announces its rate decision Wednesday.Odds of a rate cut when the Fed convenes next week held at 87.2% following the report, according to the CME Group's FedWatch gauge. The interest rate decision will be announced Wednesday.Though the September data is backward-looking, it is the last price reading the Fed will get before its monetary policy meeting next week. However, policymakers have been unusually divided in what the next steps should be for rates. One FOMC faction supports additional cuts as a way to head off further weakness in the labor market, while another sees continued threats from inflation that would require holding rates in a more restrictive position. Recent labor market indicators show a slow pace of hiring, with some private data points exhibiting an increasing level of layoffs. Labor Department data, though, actually showed a decline last week in initial unemployment benefit claims.A separate economic report Friday showed consumer sentiment a bit better than expected to start December.The University of Michigan's consumer survey came in at 53.3, up 4.5% from November and better than the Wall Street estimate for 52. Inflation expectations also dropped, with the one-year view falling to 4.1% and the five-year at 3.2%, both at their lowest levels since January.",

Andrew Caballero-reynolds | Afp | Getty ImagesPresident Donald Trump may remove members of the National Labor Relations Board and the Merit Systems Protection Board at will, a federal appeals court ruled Friday.The 2-1 decision from a panel of judges in Washington, D.C., reverses lower-court rulings blocking Trump's attempts to fire members of the key labor and employment panels.\"Congress may not restrict the President's ability to remove principal officers who wield substantial executive power,\" the two-judge majority wrote, citing a 2020 case known as Seila Law LLC v. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.They determined that another key court precedent, which was cited in the prior rulings that favored the fired board members, did not apply to the NLRB and MSPB.Those boards \"wield substantial powers that are both executive in nature and different from the powers\" that are covered by the removal protections laid out in the 1935 case known as Humphrey's Executor, the majority wrote.\"So, Congress cannot restrict the President's ability to remove NLRB or MSPB members,\" ruled Judges Gregory Katsas and Justin Walker, who were both appointed to the D.C. circuit by Trump.The Trump administration is challenging the 90-year-old precedent set by Humphrey's, which limits the president's ability to unilaterally remove the heads of certain independent government agencies. The Supreme Court on Monday is set to hear oral arguments in a case that could determine whether Humphrey's is overturned. The third judge on the appellate panel, Florence Pan, warned in a strongly worded dissent that Friday's ruling significantly increases the president's power.\"Today, my colleagues make us the first court to strike down the independence of a traditional multimember expert agency,\" Pan, an appointee of former President Joe Biden, wrote.\"Under my colleagues' reasoning, it appears that no independent agencies may lawfully exist in this country,\" she wrote. \"Their determination that the MSPB cannot be independent ... suggests that no agencies can be independent.\"Pan added that her colleagues \"redefine the type of executive power that must be placed under the exclusive command of the President, and effectively grant him dominion over approximately thirty-three previously independent agencies.\"Katsas and Walker noted that their opinion does \"not address whether Congress may restrict the President's ability to remove members of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.\"They pointed to a Supreme Court ruling from May, which, while allowing Trump to temporarily fire two NLRB and MSPB members, identified \"a 'distinct historical tradition' regarding the treatment of congressionally chartered banks, which may bear on Congress's ability to restrict the removal of their officials.\"Trump has tried to remove Fed Governor Lisa Cook, a Biden nominee, while urging the central bank and its chairman, Jerome Powell, to quickly slash U.S. interest rates. Cook sued to block her removal; the Supreme Court is set to hear oral arguments in the case on Jan. 21.Friday's ruling also does not touch on whether Congress can restrict the president's ability to fire members from certain agencies that have \"solely adjudicatory functions,\" Katsas and Walker noted.They cited the \"War Claims Commission,\" a temporary agency established after World War II to adjudicate compensation claims from American prisoners of war, as an example.Katsas and Walker additionally did not weigh in on \"whether wrongfully removed principal officers may obtain declaratory, equitable, or mandatory relief against the President or other government officials,\" they wrote.",

    "body": "Dr. Vicky Pebsworth, from left, Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor Retsef Levi, Case Western Reserve University Professor Catherine Stein and Dr. Raymond Pollak, listen to presentations during an Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) meeting to discuss childhood vaccine schedule changes at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, Georgia, U.S., December 4, 2025.Alyssa Pointer | ReutersHealth and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s handpicked vaccine committee voted on Friday to do away with the long-standing, universal recommendation that all babies receive a hepatitis B shot at birth, issuing weaker guidance for certain infants. The group, called the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, or ACIP, recommended that parents use individual decision-making in consultation with a health-care provider to determine when or if to give the hepatitis B birth dose to a baby whose mother tested negative for the virus. For babies who don't receive the birth dose, the committee recommended that they wait to receive a first vaccine until they are at least 2 months old. The acting director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention still has to sign off on that new recommendation. The CDC currently recommends that every baby get vaccinated against hepatitis B within 24 hours of birth, regardless of their mother's testing status. The move overturns that guidance, which has been credited with driving down infections in children by 99% since it was first introduced three decades ago and is widely considered to be a public health success story. Some committee members and public health experts warn that the change could have wide-ranging consequences, such as an increase in infections among kids. The vote only affects the timing of the first dose of the hepatitis B vaccine series. The second would still be given one to two months after birth, with a third dose between 6 and 18 months of age. All pregnant people are supposed to be tested for hepatitis B during pregnancy. During previous meetings, some advisors questioned the need for babies to receive a shot if their mothers test negative. But test results can produce false negatives, some people become infected later in pregnancy after being tested and babies can get infected by other members of their household. The panel's closely watched two-day meeting in Atlanta comes after Kennedy gutted the committee and appointed 12 new members, including some well-known vaccine critics. ACIP sets recommendations on who should receive certain shots and which vaccines insurers must cover at no cost. Eight members voted yes, while three voted no. Some advisors strongly pushed back on the new guidance ahead of the vote. \"This has a great potential to cause harm, and I hope that the committee accepts the responsibility when this harm is caused,\" said Dr. Joseph Hibbeln, psychiatrist and voting member. Dr. Cody Meissner, voting member and professor of pediatrics at the Dartmouth Geisel School of Medicine, said he hopes that pediatricians will continue to administer the birth dose within the first 24 hours of delivery and before discharge from the hospital. \"To follow any other course is not in the interest of infants,\" he said. Meissner added that more children will be injured and will catch hepatitis B infections. Hepatitis B, which can be passed from mother to baby during childbirth, can lead to liver disease and early death. Infants are more vulnerable to developing chronic hepatitis B infections, which have no cure. \"We will see hepatitis B come back,\" he said. \"The vaccine is so effective. It does not make sense in my mind to change the immunization schedule.\"In a statement Friday, the American Medical Association said the vote is \"reckless and undermines decades of public confidence in a proven, lifesaving vaccine.\" The group added that the decision was not based on scientific evidence and \"creates confusion for parents about how best to protect their newborns.\"Meanwhile, Retsef Levi, a voting member and Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor, falsely claimed during meetings that experts have \"never tested\" the hepatitis B vaccine \"appropriately.\" Some committee members raised concerns about vaccinating during the so-called neonatal period, which is a critical window of development for the brain and immune system. But decades of evidence show that the hepatitis B shot has been safely administered to newborns. Other advisors said there is no evidence supporting the two-month delay to the birth dose.\"We have to make decisions with the data that we have, and we must use only the credible data to make the decisions, and not speculations and not hypotheses,\" said Hibbeln. A 2024 CDC study showed that the current vaccination schedule has helped prevent more than 6 million hepatitis B infections and nearly 1 million hepatitis B-related hospitalizations.Merck and GSK manufacture the hepatitis B vaccines used starting at birth. Neither of the shots are significant revenue drivers for the companies, so the new recommendations should not have a material impact on their businesses. Still, Merck said in a statement Friday that it is \"deeply concerned\" by the vote, which it said risks \"reversing this progress and puts infants at unnecessary risk of chronic infection, liver cancer and even death.\" The company added that \"there is no evidence delaying it provides any benefit to children.\" In a statement, GSK said, \"we await additional information and an official adoption of today's recommendations by CDC to fully understand the potential impact.\"The panel's vote will not affect insurance coverage for the shots, including under Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program, Andrew Johnson, principal policy analyst for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid, told the members during the meeting.

    "body": "Logos of Netlfix and Warner Bros.ReutersThe Netflix and Warner Bros. Discovery deal came together quickly — but its path to regulatory approval may not be so speedy. Netflix stunned the media industry on Friday when it announced its proposed $72 billion deal to acquire the iconic Warner Bros. film studio and streaming service HBO Max. The combination brings together two of the most popular streaming platforms in the business. Netflix reported 300 million global subscribers as of late 2024, the last time it reported the metric. HBO Max had 128 million customers as of Sept. 30.  Netflix currently claims 46% of mobile app monthly active users in global streaming, according to data from market intelligence firm Sensor Tower. Combined with HBO Max, that share would rise to 56%, it found. \"This deal cements Netflix's position as the premier streaming service for original content,\" according to a research note from analysts at William Blair on Friday.The size of the deal makes it ripe for scrutiny, from both industry insiders and U.S. lawmakers. The Trump administration is viewing the merger with \"heavy skepticism,\" CNBC reported Friday, and Sen. Elizabeth Warren has already called for an antitrust review. \"This deal looks like an anti-monopoly nightmare. A Netflix-Warner Bros. would create one massive media giant with control of close to half of the streaming market — threatening to force Americans into higher subscription prices and fewer choices over what and how they watch, while putting American workers at risk,\" Warren, a Democrat from Massachusetts, said in a statement. The merger would also give Netflix control over the famed Warner Bros. film studio, further consolidating the cinematic space and raising concerns that the number or typical windowing of popular releases could shrink. It's typical in the days and weeks following a deal announcement of this scale for interest groups, politicians and corporate competitors to call foul on antitrust grounds. The Department of Justice is most likely to review the deal, as it has other media mergers in the past, and it could take some time. DOJ reviews can take anywhere from months to more than a year. Netflix said Friday it expects the transaction to close in 12 to 18 months, after Warner Bros. Discovery spins out its portfolio of cable networks into Discovery Global. Netflix confidenceTed Sarandos, co-chief executive officer of Netflix , attends the annual Allen & Co. Media and Technology Conference in Sun Valley, Idaho on July 11th, 2025.David A. Grogan | CNBCNetflix executives on Friday said they were \"highly confident\" the deal would win regulatory approval.\"You know, this deal is pro-consumer, pro-innovation, pro-worker, it's pro-creator, it's pro-growth,\" Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos said during an investor call following the acquisition announcement. \"Our plans here are to work really closely with all the appropriate governments and regulators, but [we're] really confident that we're going to get all the necessary approvals that we need,\" Sarandos added. As part of the deal, Netflix has agreed to pay a $5.8 billion breakup fee to Warner Bros. Discovery if the deal were to get blocked by the government. Netflix's bid won out over competing offers from Paramount Skydance and Comcast. Analysts at Deutsche Bank and William Blair were at least minimally convinced Friday of the potential for the deal to go through. \"A merger of Warner Bros. Discovery and any of the three bidders would probably succeed, even if the DOJ were to sue to block a proposed combination,\" Deutsche Bank analysts wrote in a note on Friday, citing insights from a Department of Justice veteran who the analysts said \"does not see any significant antitrust problems with any of the three scenarios.\" \"However ... we don't know all of the detailed facts that will be collected and analyzed by the DOJ, nor do we know who the judge hearing the case will be, and both of these factors can have an impact on the outcome,\" the Deutsche Bank analysts noted.  Paramount, for its part, has been fanning the flames. Paramount's lawyers sent a letter to Warner Bros. Discovery this week, first reported by CNBC, in which it argued the sale process had been rigged in Netflix's direction. The Wall Street Journal reported that in a separate letter, Paramount said a Netflix transaction would likely \"never close\" because of regulatory headwinds. Paramount was the only bidder looking to buy WBD's massive portfolio of pay-TV networks — and it's unlikely to walk away from the process quietly. Not so fastOracle co-founder, CTO and Executive Chairman Larry Ellison (C), U.S. President Donald Trump, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman (R), and SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son (2nd-R), share a laugh as Ellison uses a stool to stand on as he speaks during a news conference in the Roosevelt Room of the White House on January 21, 2025 in Washington, DC. Trump announced an investment in artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure and took questions on a range of topics including his presidential pardons of Jan. 6 defendants, the war in Ukraine, cryptocurrencies and other topics.Andrew Harnik | Getty ImagesWall Street expected President Donald Trump's second term to usher in a windfall of dealmaking. However, economic uncertainty has slowed the process for some companies, and regulatory holdups have played a bigger role than anticipated.  \"Under Donald Trump, the antitrust review process has also become a cesspool of political favoritism and corruption,\" Warren said in Friday's statement. \"The Justice Department must enforce our nation's anti-monopoly laws fairly and transparently — not use the Warner Bros. deal review to invite influence-peddling and bribery.\" Paramount's merger with Skydance was left in limbo for more than a year before it finally won federal approval in July. The Federal Communications Commission (which is unlikely to review the Netflix-WBD tie-up since it doesn't involve a broadcaster) signed off on the $8 billion merger shortly after Paramount agreed to pay $16 million to Trump to settle a lawsuit over the editing of a \"60 Minutes\" interview with former Vice President Kamala Harris. Paramount had also ended its diversity, equity and inclusion policies earlier in the year after the FCC said it would investigate the company over its DEI programs. In September, the newly combined Paramount Skydance, run by David Ellison, set its sights on Warner Bros. Discovery. The company is now considering whether to take a hostile bid straight to WBD shareholders and try to unseat Netflix as the would-be buyer, CNBC reported Friday. Ellison's billionaire father, Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison, is known to be close with Trump. The argument for whether to clear Netflix's proposed takeover of Warner Bros. would likely come down to questions around streaming — first, on pricing for consumers, and second, on how to define Netflix's audience. The pricing of streaming subscriptions has risen across the board in recent years. In 2022 Netflix instituted a cheaper, ad-supported model after years of resistance in an effort to beckon more customers. The following year, Disney followed with its own more-affordable plan. Netflix is used to upending the legacy media industry. The company ended its DVD rentals business in 2023 and went all in on streaming. It's since found massive scale and has taken over the zeitgeist with original series like \"Squid Game,\" \"Wednesday,\" \"Stranger Things,\" and \"Bridgerton.\" Its maverick approach to media and its broadening foothold in the industry may be its saving grace in the eyes of regulators. \"My expectation on the regulatory side is Netflix is going to advocate and argue with their advisors for a very expansive definition of what their market is ... so that would include broadcast, cable, subscription and ad-supported streaming,\" said said Jeff Goldstein, a partner and managing director at AlixPartners, and co-lead of the U.S. Media group. \"And really, really, really importantly, that would include YouTube,\" he said.YouTube has come to dominate the industry when it comes to viewership. Nielsen once again reported in October than YouTube had the largest share of TV usage, with Netflix in sixth place and Warner Bros. Discovery in seventh place. Traditional media companies with linear networks — Disney, NBCUniversal, Fox and Paramount — filled the spots in between. Critics of the deal will define Netflix's reach more narrowly to try to demonstrate outsized dominance, said Goldstein. \"I believe that streaming is not a category. Television viewership is a category ... you know, eyeballs might be a category,\" media industry titan John Malone told CNBC in November when asked about antitrust questions surrounding the WBD sale process. \"But if you're going to broaden the category to that, you got to take in YouTube and Facebook and the social networks, TikTok,\" he said. \"I mean, that's really the question, is streaming a category? ... Are studios a category ... and is that going to get looked at hard? These regulatory things are a little bit difficult to predict.\" — CNBC's Julia Boorstin contributed to this report. Disclosure: Comcast is the parent company of NBCUniversal, which owns CNBC. Versant would become the new parent company of CNBC upon Comcast's planned spinoff of Versant.",

    "body": "Jacob Wackerhausen | Istock | Getty ImagesEarlier this week, the White House — in conjunction with Michael Dell, founder and CEO of Dell Technologies, and his wife, Susan — announced one of the largest donations ever to benefit American children.  The Dells' $6.25 billion pledge goes hand in hand with a new federal government program focused on early wealth building. The money will go into a new child savings account for children under 18. Those who qualify can receive a $250 grant from the Dells' commitment or a one-time $1,000 initial deposit from the government to seed the so-called Trump accounts. Here's what families need to know about how the program works:What are Trump accounts?Trump accounts, a type of tax-advantaged savings and investment account, were created under President Donald Trump's \"big beautiful bill,\" which Congress passed in July.The accounts function like an individual retirement account, with some exceptions. These accounts can receive contributions from multiple sources, such as family or employers, and the funds grow tax-deferred. How do you open a Trump account?Trump accounts are not yet available; however, families who want to open one can start that process now. Any authorized individual — a legal guardian, parent, adult sibling or grandparent — can open a Trump account on behalf of a child age 18 or younger, as long as the child is a U.S. citizen.To open the account, an election must be made on IRS Form 4547, named after Trump's presidential terms. The form can be filed separately or with your 2025 tax return. Starting in mid-2026, you can also make the election online at trumpaccounts.gov.After filing the form, the Treasury Department will confirm that the account has been opened with an \"authentication process,\" according to a White House document. That fact sheet does not specify what the process will entail.Initially, Trump accounts will be held with the Treasury's \"designated financial agent,\" with the opportunity to transfer the full balance to your preferred brokerage firm at a later date, the Treasury said this week.lisegagne | E+ | Getty ImagesHow do you claim the Trump account free money?Once an account is established, eligible children may receive either the one-time $1,000 contribution from the Department of the Treasury, or the $250 Dell family grant, deposited to their Trump account.  Parents of babies born in 2025 through 2028 can elect to receive the $1,000, known as the \"pilot program contribution,\" on Form 4547. There are no income requirements, and everyone is eligible for the government's seed money.  Although Form 4547 can be filed at any time, no pilot program contribution will be deposited in the Trump account of a child earlier than July 4, 2026, according to the IRS.Children 10 or under and born before Jan. 1, 2025 — who wouldn't qualify for the $1,000 initial deposit from the Treasury — could get a $250 contribution if they live in a ZIP code where the median income is $150,000 or less. That money is aimed toward lower-income families based on their ZIP code, and there is no additional form required for the Dell contribution.Children older than 10 may benefit, too, if funds remain available after initial sign-ups, according to a fact sheet from the Dell Foundation.CNBC analyzed U.S. Census Bureau data for median incomes and population ages for each U.S. ZIP code. Only about 3% of ZIP codes have median incomes above $150,000. How can you fund a Trump account?As of July 4, 2026, parents, guardians, grandparents and others will be able to contribute up to $5,000 a year in after-tax dollars up until the year before the beneficiary turns 18. The annual contribution limit indexes for inflation after 2027.Employers can also contribute up to $2,500 per worker, per year, which is part of the $5,000 limit and won't count as taxable income, according to the IRS. This figure also adjusts for inflation after 2027.Additionally, qualifying charitable organizations and state and local governments may make contributions that do not count toward the $5,000 limit.What are the investment options for Trump accounts?Trump account investments are restricted to \"broad U.S. equity index funds,\" according to the Treasury, such as mutual or exchange-traded funds. These assets:must track a \"qualified index.\"can't use leverage, which typically uses debt or borrowing to boost returns.can't exceed annual fees or expenses above 0.1%.While the definition of \"qualified index\" remains unclear, these criteria could include about 186 mutual funds and ETFs, according to data from Morningstar Direct. How much could your Trump account grow?Experts say the one-time $250 or $1,000 grant won't grow substantially over the first 18 years without additional contributions. For example, $1,000 funded at birth could be worth around $4,700 by age 18, assuming a 9% annual return, and without considering inflation, according to chartered financial analyst Jason Norris. \"If the same family is able to contribute $50 per month, the account value at age 18 could potentially grow to greater than $29,000,\" said Norris, who is director of equity research and portfolio management at Ferguson Wellman Capital Management in Portland, Oregon, which ranked No. 12 on CNBC's Financial Advisor 100 list for 2025.\"That is a meaningful difference over that period of time,\" he said.The goal is to \"create a broad-based stakeholder economy,\" said Jason Ewas, associate director at the Aspen Institute Financial Security Program, a nonprofit forum. \"Half of the population doesn't own stocks,\" he said. When it comes to wealth-building opportunities, particularly by investing in the stock market, \"this is a way to make a statement about getting a foot in the door,\" Ewas said.Many families continually miss out on stock market gains while wealth rises fastest for those at the very top, data from the Federal Reserve also shows, as the value of their investment holdings continues to grow. The top 10% of Americans hold more than 87% of corporate equities and mutual fund shares.When can you withdraw funds from a Trump account? Generally, it's not possible to withdraw Trump account funds before age 18. But there are limited exceptions, including certain rollovers, distribution upon death and for excess contributions, according to the IRS.You may roll over the entire account to another brokerage, known as a trustee-to-trustee transfer. Certain rollovers to Achieving a Better Life Experience, or ABLE, accounts, for individuals with disabilities, may also be permitted during the year the child turns 17.Once the child reaches age 18, the standard rules for traditional IRAs apply. Withdrawals before age 59½ are generally subject to income taxes and a 10% penalty. There are certain penalty exceptions, such as for distributions for higher education expenses or first home purchases.watch nowWhat are the alternatives to a Trump account?Trump accounts are like other savings account options that already exist, including 529 college savings plans, which have higher contribution limits. In fact, there are at least 11 alternative tax-advantaged savings vehicles, each with different rules, limitations and regulations, according to the Tax Foundation. Some, like a Roth IRA, are geared toward retirement, while others, like a 529 plan, are aimed at education expenses. Some financial advisors say that the Trump accounts may not offer the best tax incentives. But with every case, the bulk of Americans who can take advantage of these accounts are high-income households, experts also say, because they can afford to make the maximum annual contributions.  Subscribe to CNBC on YouTube.",

    "body": "watch nowNetflix announced Friday it's reached a deal to buy pieces of Warner Bros. Discovery, bringing a swift end to a dramatic bidding process that saw Paramount Skydance and Comcast also vying for the legacy assets. The transaction is comprised of cash and stock and is valued at $27.75 per WBD share, the companies said. That puts the equity value of the deal at $72 billion, with a total enterprise value of approximately $82.7 billion. Netflix will acquire Warner Bros.' film studio and streaming service, HBO Max. Warner Bros. Discovery will move forward with its previously planned spinout of Discovery Global, which includes its massive portfolio of pay TV networks, such as TNT and CNN. The blockbuster deal brings together the streaming giant Netflix, which has upended the media industry in recent years, and the storied Warner Bros. film studio, known for its library including \"The Wizard of Oz,\" the Harry Potter franchise and the DC comics universe. It will also include the content of HBO Max, including \"The Sopranos\" and \"Game of Thrones.\"\"I know some of you're surprised that we're making this acquisition, and I certainly understand why. Over the years, we have been known to be builders, not buyers,\" Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos said on an investor call Friday morning. \"We already have incredible shows and movies and a great business model, and it's working for talent, it's working for consumers and it's working for shareholders. This is a rare opportunity,\" he said. \"It's going to help us achieve our mission to entertain the world and to bring people together through great stories.\"Netflix's initial bid for WBD's studio and streaming assets was for $27 a share, according to a person familiar with the matter. That trumped Paramount's offer at the time and turned the trajectory of the sales talks in Netflix's direction, said the person, who asked not to be named because the discussions were private.The acquisition is expected to close after the TV networks separation takes place, now expected in the third quarter of 2026. The companies estimated the transaction would close in 12 to 18 months. CNBC has reached out to Comcast and Paramount for comment.As part of the deal, every Warner Bros. Discovery shareholder will receive $23.25 in cash and $4.50 in shares of Netflix common stock for each share of WBD common stock outstanding following the close of the deal. Netflix and Warner Bros. Discovery said each of their boards of directors unanimously approved the deal, which is subject to regulatory approval as well as approval of WBD shareholders. Netflix has agreed to pay a $5.8 billion reverse break-up fee if the deal is not approved, according to a Securities and Exchange Commission filing. Warner Bros. Discovery would pay a $2.8 billion breakup fee if it decides to call off the deal to pursue a different merger.Edging out ParamountThe merger could invite regulatory scrutiny given the size of the expansive streaming businesses for each company. Netflix said it surpassed 300 million global streaming subscribers at the end of 2024, the last time it publicly reported its customer count. Warner Bros. Discovery said it had 128 million global subscribers as of Sept. 30. Paramount raised the potential for antitrust concerns earlier this week in a letter to Warner Bros. Discovery management as second-round bids came in, The Wall Street Journal reported. The newly merged Paramount Skydance made its initial run at Warner Bros. Discovery in September, submitting three bids before WBD launched a formal sale process. The David Ellison-run company was the only suitor bidding for the entirety of WBD's portfolio — the film studio, streaming business and TV networks.Paramount's final bid, received Thursday evening, was for $30 per share, all cash, people close to the matter told CNBC, speaking on the condition of anonymity about confidential dealings. Paramount's offer included a $5 billion breakup fee if the transaction didn't win regulatory approval after roughly 10 months, the people said. Earlier this week, Paramount raised questions about the \"fairness and adequacy\" of the sale process, contending Warner Bros. Discovery favored Netflix.\"It has become increasingly clear, through media reporting and otherwise, that WBD appears to have abandoned the semblance and reality of a fair transaction process, thereby abdicating its duties to stockholders, and embarked on a myopic process with a predetermined outcome that favors a single bidder,\" Paramount attorneys said in a letter to Warner Bros. Discovery management.— CNBC's David Faber, Kasey O'Brien and Laya Neelakandan contributed to this report.Disclosure: Comcast is the parent company of NBCUniversal, which owns CNBC. Versant would become the new parent company of CNBC upon Comcast’s planned spinoff of Versant.",

    "body": "When it comes to managing your finances, you may feel like you have to do the most: reap the most rewards from your credit cards, pay as little as you can in taxes, earn the highest returns on your investments and extract the most interest from your savings. If you feel this sort of pressure, you come by it honestly, says Christine Benz, director of personal finance and retirement at Morningstar and author of \"How to Retire.\" \"The [financial] industry has this optimizing mindset,\" she tells CNBC Make It. \"If you're just learning and getting up to speed, you probably start to think that's the only way to do this stuff and that you're doing it wrong if you cut corners.\"To be clear, if you're the kind of person who enjoys drilling down into every tiny detail of your finances, and has time to do so that's fine, Benz says. But for the rest of us, taking a simplified approach can free up time and energy to do other things while keeping us on track to reach our financial goals, she says. In a recent article for Morningstar, Benz called this the \"good enough\" approach to managing finances. Though they may not be moves to \"maximize\" your finances, consider these four strategies, which she says will achieve similar results \"with much less time and hassle.\"Reverse budgetingMany major financial goals, such as saving for retirement and paying down debt, are predicated on your ability to consistently save a portion of your income, Benz says. \"If you are saving reasonably, it obviates the need to do a lot of other things,\" she says. \"Even if you make subpar decisions about investment selections, for example, if the savings rate is decent, it addresses a lot of things that might not be perfect in the plan.\"Put simply, consistently investing 20% of your income into a below average portfolio will likely get you a better outcome than putting 5% in and earning above-average returns. If you want to keep things really simple, try a strategy Benz uses known as reverse budgeting. Rather than trying to tinker with your spending to optimize your savings rate, pick a flat percentage of your income — Benz says 15% is a good target — and set that money to automatically come out of each paycheck to be put toward financial goals. The rest of the money is yours to spend as you see fit. Index investingTheoretically, someone picking the right investments at the right time can beat the stock market over the long term. In practice, though, it's really tough to do. Consider the managers of large-company U.S. stock funds, whose job it is to beat the S&P 500. Over the decade ended June 2025, just 8% of those mutual funds survived and beat the benchmark, according to Morningstar. That's why Benz recommends building a core portfolio of index funds, which come with low fees and merely track the performance of market indexes rather than trying to beat them. \"A lot of data point to the fact that index funds are really terrific choices, and they're hands off,\" she says. \"They can give you exposure to a lot of different parts of the stock and bond market with a single holding.\"\"To me, index funds are a great intersection of optimization and the 'good enough' portfolio.\"Simplifying financial relationshipsNo one wants to park their cash in an account that offers practically no interest. But you needn't move your money around in search of a few tenths of a percentage point either, Benz says. \"It drives me crazy — the idea of people running around trying to get the best cash instrument,\" she says. \"The best way to tip things in your favor is to go with a low-cost provider that will deliver a persistently competitive yield.\"In the context of a brokerage, that may mean comparing what you'll get on so-called \"sweep accounts\" — the places where your money sits within your brokerage account when it's not invested, she says. For high-yield savings accounts, it pays to remember that rates fluctuate, Benz says. It will probably be less of a headache to stick with a bank that you like and that pays a generous rate rather than ping-ponging between online banks offering the highest rate of the year. And if that bank or brokerage also offers credit cards with rewards you like, all the better, she says. When it comes time for you or someone else to get hands-on with your money, having more of it under one roof tends to make things more manageable.\"Reducing the number of financial relationships is such a good practice, which doesn't mean you want to be completely lazy,\" she says. \"But if you can try to skinny down the number of entities that you need to connect with, it's good all around.\"Using an advisorBenz thinks and writes about finances for a living. She published a book about retirement. Still, when it comes to managing money and planning her own retirement, Benz and her husband have enlisted the help of a financial planner. Doing so allows Benz to have an optimized financial plan — she's just letting someone else help with all the fine-tuning. \"She has it all calibrated, and that gives me a lot of peace of mind, knowing that someone else is doing that optimization and using pretty high-powered tools to do it, too,\" Benz says. It's not that Benz or you or anyone else couldn't figure this out on their own. But delegating some of the heavy lifting can free you up to focus on the things you really want to spend time and energy on. Benz favors fee-only planners, who may charge an hourly fee, bill you for specific services or charge something akin to a monthly or annual subscription rate. The key is, they don't get paid to sell you certain financial products, which can be a conflict of interest, Benz says. For Benz, working with a pro has been worth the cost. \"I felt a little glimmer of like, 'Oh, I should be doing this on my own,'\" she says. \"But ultimately, I realized that turning to someone who, importantly, has tools to come up with some really good answers ... that I don't necessarily have, I decided it was a good value proposition.\"Want to stand out, grow your network, and get more job opportunities? Sign up today for Smarter by CNBC Make It's new online course, How to Build a Standout Personal Brand: Online, In Person, and At Work.

    "body": "The logo for Google LLC is seen at the Google Store Chelsea in Manhattan, New York City, U.S., November 17, 2021. Andrew Kelly | ReutersA U.S. judge on Friday added new details to the remedies resulting from Google's antitrust case, finalizing the consequences the company faces after its defeat last year.In mid-2024, Google was found to hold an illegal monopoly in its core market of internet search, and in September of this year, U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta ruled against the most severe consequences that were proposed by the Department of Justice, including a forced sale of Google's Chrome browser.Google was, however, ordered to loosen its hold on search data.Mehta on Friday issued additional details for his ruling. \"The age-old saying 'the devil is in the details' may not have been devised with the drafting of an antitrust remedies judgment in mind, but it sure does fit,\" Mehta wrote in one of the Friday filings. Mehta wrote that Google can't enter into any deal like the one it's had with Apple \"unless the agreement terminates no more than one year after the date it is entered.\" Google pays billions of dollars per year to Apple to be the default search engine on the Safari browser on iPhones, Macs and iPads.The judge's ruling includes deals involving generative artificial intelligence products, and any \"application, software, service, feature, tool, functionality, or product\" that involve or use genAI or large language models.GenAI \"plays a significant role in these remedies,\" Mehta wrote.Mehta on Friday also included requirements on the makeup of a technical committee that will determine with whom Google must share its data. Committee \"members shall be experts in some combination of software engineering, information retrieval, artificial intelligence, economics, behavioral science, and data privacy and data security,\" the filing says.The judge went on to say that no committee member can have a conflict of interest, such as having worked for Google or any of its competitors in the six months prior to or one year after serving in the role.Mehta said the committee must \"have access to Google's source code and algorithms, subject to a confidentiality agreement,\" and reiterated the web index data it will require Google to share with certain competitors. Google has to share some of the raw search interaction data it uses to train its ranking and AI systems, but not the actual algorithms. In September, Mehta said those data sets represent a \"small fraction\" of Google's overall traffic, but argued the company's models are trained on data that contributed to Google's edge over competitors.In August 2024, Mehta ruled that Google violated Section 2 of the Sherman Act and held a monopoly in search and related advertising. The antitrust trial started in September 2023.Google did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The company has previously said it will appeal the judge's monopoly ruling.WATCH: Judge Issues final remedies in Google antitrust casewatch now",

    "body": "Hampton Dumpty is the new corporate mascot for Willow Wealth, formerly known as Yieldstreet. The company is rebranding as its customers reel from investment losses.Source: Willow WealthAs Yieldstreet tries to distance itself from a rocky past with a new name and ad campaign, its customers are dealing with a present reality that is increasingly dire.The private markets investing startup, freshly rebranded as Willow Wealth, last week informed customers of new defaults on real estate projects in Houston and Nashville, Tennessee, CNBC has learned.The letters, obtained and verified by CNBC, account for about $41 million in new losses. They come on the heels of $89 million in marine loan wipeouts disclosed in September and $78 million in losses revealed by CNBC in an August report.In total, Willow Wealth investors have lost at least $208 million, according to CNBC reporting.Willow Wealth also removed a decade of historical performance data from public view in recent weeks. A chart on the company's website showing annualized returns of negative 2% for real estate investments from 2015 to 2025 — down from 9.4% gains just two years prior — has been taken down.\"They had to change their name,\" said Mark Williams, a professor at Boston University's Questrom School of Business. \"Their old name had negative value to it, so they're trying to do a 2.0 to restart things. They're also making it harder to uncover their poor performance by removing the stats, which is alarming.\"The high-stakes rebranding is the latest chapter for a company that sought to empower retail investors, but instead left some of them saddled with deep losses and years of uncertainty.Under its former name, Willow Wealth — backed by prominent venture firms and buoyed by aggressive online marketing — had been the best known of a wave of American startups that promised to broaden access to the alternative investments that are the domain of institutions and rich families.But the still-unfolding collapse of its real estate funds demonstrates the risks the private markets hold for retail investors. By their very nature, private investments don't trade on exchanges and lack standardized disclosures. That leaves investors especially reliant on private fund managers, both for information and to safeguard their interests for years while their money is locked up in deals.Private markets have gained in prominence this year after President Donald Trump signed an executive order to allow the investments in retirement plans.While critics say that opaque, illiquid investments with high management fees aren't appropriate for ordinary investors, asset managers including BlackRock and Apollo Global Management see retail as a vast untapped pool of capital. Retirement giant Empower said in May that it would allow private assets into the 401(k) plans of participating employers with help from firms including Apollo and Goldman Sachs.New mascot, same pitch Against this backdrop, Willow Wealth CEO Mitch Caplan, a former E-Trade chief who took the helm in May, said the company was heading toward a new model. Instead of only offering deals sourced by the startup, it would also sell private market funds from Wall Street giants including Goldman and Carlyle Group.The company no longer provides the historical performance of its offerings because of the pivot to third party-managed funds, according to a person with knowledge of the situation who asked for anonymity to discuss internal strategy.\"Transparency is paramount to us, and we consistently provide strategy-specific performance information for each manager at the offering level to support informed decision making,\" said a Willow Wealth spokeswoman.As for CNBC's reporting on the new real estate defaults and rising tally of losses, the Willow Wealth spokeswoman called it a \"rehash\" of news on \"investments from five years ago.\"\"The investments in question represent a very small portion of our overall portfolio and do not reflect the current nature of our offerings or business focus,\" she said.The firm declined to say how much it manages in assets.The startup — founded in 2015 by Michael Weisz and Milind Mehere, who remain on Willow Wealth's board of directors — told customers that private investments would provide both higher returns and lower volatility than traditional assets.Willow Wealth's pitch hasn't changed much, despite the rebrand.In a new ad campaign, a character called Hampton Dumpty says that he's \"learned a thing or two about crashes\" and therefore uses Willow Wealth to diversify his portfolio with private market assets including real estate.The mascot, a play on the Humpty-Dumpty nursery rhyme, tells viewers that \"portfolios including private markets have outperformed traditional ones for the past 20 years.\"Compounding feesOn its revamped website, the firm has a chart showing a hypothetical portfolio made of private equity, private credit and real estate outperforming traditional stocks and bonds over the decade through 2025.But the chart doesn't include the impact of fees, which are typically far higher for private investments than for stock ETFs and mutual funds. The company also notes in a disclosure that customers can't actually invest in the private market indexes listed.While most stock ETFs carry fees below 0.2%, Willow Wealth typically charges 10 times more than that, or 2% annually on unreturned funds, for its real estate offerings, according to product documents.Willow Wealth also charged an array of one-time fees associated with the creation of the funds, including for structuring the deal and arranging the loans.Fees for Willow Wealth's new products are even higher. The company charges about 1.4% annually for access to portfolios made up of private funds from Goldman Sachs, Carlyle and the StepStone Group, according to its website.Those firms also charge their own fees, leading to all-in annual costs ranging from about 3.3% to 6.7% per fund, according to the providers' documents.That makes Willow Wealth's products among the most expensive in the retail investing universe.'Difficult news'For customers still coming to terms with their losses and who remain in limbo on funds that the firm says are on \"watchlist\" for possible default, Yieldstreet's transformation into Willow Wealth looks like an effort to evade accountability, the customers told CNBC.After last week's disclosures, nine out of the 30 real estate deals reviewed by CNBC since August are now in default. That 30% failure rate is high, even by the standards of the private assets world, said Boston University's Williams.Though the realm of private credit is more opaque, making average default rates difficult to pinpoint, some in the industry estimate typical failure rates of between 2% and 8%.Whether they were apartments in hot downtown areas or established cities, or single-family homes scattered across Southern boomtowns, projects that Willow Wealth put its customers into struggled to hit revenue targets and fell behind on loan payments.Willow Wealth has blamed the failures on the Federal Reserve's interest rate hiking cycle in 2022, which made repaying floating-rate debt harder.Among newly disclosed defaults are a pair of funds tied to a 268-unit luxury apartment building in East Nashville called Stacks on Main.Investors hoping to earn the advertised 16.4% annual return put a combined $18.2 million into the two funds, according to documents reviewed by CNBC. They later added another $2 million in a member loan meant to stabilize the deal.Stacks on Main apartment complex in Nashville, Tenn.Courtesy: Google Maps\"Your equity investment is expected to incur a full loss\" after selling Stacks on Main on Nov. 25, Willow Wealth told customers in a letter dated that same day. Investors in the member loan will lose up to 60%, the company said.\"We understand this is difficult news to receive,\" Willow Wealth told customers. \"We share in your disappointment.\"Documents for the 2022 transactions listed Nazare Capital, the family office of former WeWork CEO Adam Neumann, as the sponsor for the deal. Real estate sponsors typically source, acquire and manage deals on behalf of investors.In 2022, after his WeWork tenure ended, Neumann founded property startup Flow, which took on some of the real estate deals from his family office.In public comments to news outlets over the past year, representatives from Flow have sought to distance the company from the travails of then-Yieldstreet.But according to the 2022 investment memo, Nazare purchased Stacks on Main in July 2021 for $79 million and then offloaded a majority stake to Yieldstreet members through a joint venture.Crucially, the transaction saddled the joint venture with $62.1 million in debt, a burden which would later prove instrumental in the deal's failure, CNBC found. Israeli-American businessman Adam Neumann speaks during The Israeli American Council (IAC) 8th Annual National Summit on January 19, 2023 in Austin, Texas.Shahar Azran | Getty Images\"This building was majority-owned by YieldStreet and the property was never operated either by Flow or anyone associated with Adam,\" a spokeswoman for Neumann told CNBC. \"In any event, the building has been sold and Flow no longer has a minority interest nor any involvement in this property.\" Nazare was also listed as sponsor for another Nashville project that went sideways for retail investors, an apartment complex at 2010 West End Ave. That project resulted in $35 million in losses across two funds, wipeouts that were previously reported by CNBC.Besides the deals tied to Nazare, there were other defaults.A project called the Houston Multi-Family Equity fund, made up of apartments across suburban Texas, resulted in a loss of all $21 million of customer funds, the startup told investors in a Nov. 25 letter. \"The property was unable to generate sufficient revenue to pay monthly debt service and operating expenses\" and went into foreclosure, resulting in a \"full loss of the equity,\" Willow Wealth said.A 'high-risk' trapThe tally of Willow Wealth's investor losses is likely to rise further.For instance, an $11.6 million loan made by Willow Wealth customers for a Portland, Oregon, multifamily project is \"currently in default\" after an appraisal found that the borrower owed more than the real estate was worth, the company told investors.Willow Wealth is trying to restructure the borrower's loan to avoid selling the property for a loss, the company said in a letter to investors.The company has also warned investors that a Tucson, Arizona, apartment complex and two projects made up of single-family rental homes across Southern states were likely to result in future losses of unspecified amounts, according to separate letters. Investors put more than $63 million combined into those deals.Williams, the Boston University professor and a former Federal Reserve bank examiner, said he taught a class this fall on how Willow Wealth and other fintech firms failed to protect their customers.\"They claimed they were going to democratize access to the types of deals only the rich had,\" Williams said. \"In reality, they created a high-risk trap for investors.\"watch now",

Carlos Osorio | ReutersCompany: Barrick Mining (B)Business: Barrick Mining, formerly Barrick Gold Corporation, is a gold and copper producer, which is engaged in the production and sale of gold and copper, as well as related activities, such as exploration and mine development. It has ownership interests in producing gold mines in Argentina, Canada, Cote d'Ivoire, the Democratic Republic of Congo, the Dominican Republic, Papua New Guinea, Tanzania and the United States. Its copper mines are in Zambia, Chile and Saudi Arabia. Its operations include Nevada Gold Mines, Bulyanhulu, Hemlo, Jabal Sayid, Kibali, Loulo-Gounkoto, Lumwana, North Mara, Porgera, Pueblo Viejo, Tongon, Veladero and Zaldivar. Its Bulyanhulu operation is located in northwest Tanzania, over 55 kilometers south of Lake Victoria and 150 km southwest of the city of Mwanza. The Jabal Sayid copper operation is located 350 km northeast of Jeddah in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The Lumwana copper mine is a conventional open pit operation.Stock Market Value: $69.16 billion ($40.38 per share)Stock Chart IconStock chart iconBarrick Mining shares year to dateActivist: Elliott Investment ManagementOwnership: n/aAverage Cost: n/aActivist Commentary: Elliott is a multistrategy investment firm that manages about $76.1 billion in assets (as of June 30, 2025) and is one of the oldest firms of its type under continuous management. Known for its extensive due diligence and resources, Elliott regularly follows companies for years before making an investment. Elliott is the most active of activist investors, engaging with companies across industries and multiple geographies.What's happeningOn Nov. 18, Elliott announced a position in Barrick Mining and expressed its interest in seeing a potential separation of North American assets from its mines in riskier regions across Asia and Africa. Most recently, on Dec. 1, Barrick announced that the board has authorized the company to explore a potential separation of the North American assets.Behind the scenesBarrick Mining is a Toronto-based global mining company focused predominantly on gold, operating 14 gold mines, as well as three additional cooper mines. The core of this business is its North America Gold assets, which consists of some of the highest quality deposits in the world, specifically Nevada Gold Mines, a joint venture with Newmont in which Barrick owns 61.5% and serves as its operator. The company also operates gold mines in Africa, the Middle East, Latin America, and Asia. Its copper portfolio is centered around Africa and the Middle East, including Reko Diq, a new copper development project in Pakistan. With the recent bull market for gold, Barrick's stock has more than doubled over the past six months. Despite this, Barrick continues to trade at 0.9 times its price to net asset value ratio, a significant discount to North American peers, who trade well above 1x, with best-in-class peers like Agnico Eagle trading at approximately 1.5x.Investors buy gold companies primarily for gold price exposure, and from there prefer the companies with the best management teams that operate the companies most efficiently to best isolate the value of the commodity. Barrick has not been a top operator amongst its peers and, as a result, they abruptly parted ways with their CEO in September and replaced him with Mark Hill, the former COO, as interim CEO. An interim CEO creates two very valuable opportunities for an activist in a company like Barrick. First and most importantly, they get to have a voice in who the new CEO will be regardless of whether they settle with the company for a board seat or just remain an outspoken shareholder. While they may not always be in the room when the discussions are had or the decision is made, we know of no CEO who would take a job at a company with an activist like Elliott engaging unless they knew that Elliott approved of the hiring. Second, when a company has an interim CEO, it is an advantageous time to explore strategic alternatives, and a breakup of this company has always been the elephant in the room. Barrick's North American operations have been sullied by the company's exposure to higher-risk regions and separating the two would go a long way to close the valuation gap between Barrick and Agnico Eagle. The value proposition for a breakup is clear and even something management has discussed. In a presentation released in May, management demonstrated that applying a peer-like multiple to Barrick's North American assets could unlock as much as 49% of unrealized value. Since then, the price of gold has appreciated by over 70% but the company's stock has appreciated by more than 100%, so much of that gain has been realized but there is still some value to be realized from a breakup.  Elliott has a history of taking board seats at companies not for activist's sake, but only when they feel that the director they are putting on the board could genuinely add value for shareholders. In this case, the breakup of the company is something that is being seriously considered by the board, and Elliott, just by its existence, is likely to have at least negative approval power over the new CEO. Moreover, Elliott does not act impetuously in its activism. They have likely had a position in Barrick for many months at this point and have already received a great return from the company's 100% appreciation in the past six months. We would not expect them to escalate their activism here unless either the board goes down a path they didn't expect and don't agree with, or it is at the company's invitation to join the board to assist with the tasks ahead.Ken Squire is the founder and president of 13D Monitor, an institutional research service on shareholder activism, and the founder and portfolio manager of the 13D Activist Fund, a mutual fund that invests in a portfolio of activist investments.",

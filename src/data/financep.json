    "body": "House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., holds a press conference as Congress faces a midnight Friday deadline for a deal to fund the Department of Homeland Security, in the U.S. Capitol in Washington, Feb. 13, 2026.Annabelle Gordon | ReutersAs they gathered in northern Virginia on Wednesday for their annual policy retreat, House Democrats rallied like they were on the brink of victory.\"House Democrats are on the verge of a takeover. The break's over for these MAGA extremists,\" Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., said at the leadership press conference kicking off the retreat. \"It's over because people know that Donald Trump and House Republicans have failed the American people.\"Jeffries and his Democratic colleagues have toiled this Congress as House Republicans hold a razor-thin majority. They see a path back to power by focusing on affordability and the economy in this year's midterm elections, pointing to topics they say Trump has largely neglected.Read more CNBC politics coverageState of the Union 2026 recap: Trump touted economic gainsEpstein files: Trump sexual abuse claims withheld by DOJSenators tell CFTC prediction market contracts need clear guidanceDemocrats seek to force refunds after Supreme Court blocks Trump tariffsTrump demands Netflix fire Susan Rice as DOJ probes Warner dealMuch of the three-day policy retreat is focused on cost-of-living issues. Guests include labor union leaders, representatives from the Black Economic Alliance and the National Low Income Housing Coalition, and Virginia Gov. Abigail Spanberger, a former member of the House who delivered the Democratic rebuttal to Trump's Tuesday night State of the Union.Democrats will use the time together away from the Capitol to hone their messages to voters and to coalesce around what they think are the themes that will resonate with ordinary Americans.\"Is the president working for you?\" Spanberger asked in her speech, which made the case that Trump's policies were hurting average Americans.\"This is the defining contrast of the midterms. While Republicans broke their promise to lower costs, Democrats are focused on lowering costs for hardworking families just trying to get by,\" said Rep. Suzan DelBene, D-Wash., chair of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and the person responsible for leading her party to taking control of the House.But victory is far from assured. Trump and Republicans are making their own aggressive pitch on affordability. They also have a cash advantage this cycle. And they have rolled out a series of election proposals — like voter-identification requirements and changes to mail voting — that Democrats say could disenfranchise millions. Coupled with the Supreme Court's pending decision on a challenge to a section of the Voting Rights Act that, if upheld, could eliminate some Democratic-held districts, Republicans are not out of contention come November.Still, there is cause for Democratic optimism. Recent polling shows many Americans are souring on Trump — a Washington Post-ABC News-Ipsos poll found 60% disapprove of the president. And Democrats have maintained a healthy lead in the generic ballot. Also, they need to net just three seats to flip the House.\"President Trump wants to take over elections. He's going to continue to tweet out and put out executive orders. He and republican governors could do other untoward things to affect our elections,\" House Democratic Caucus Chair Pete Aguilar, D-Calif., said. \"What we can control is communicating a message that will resonate to people. And that's what we're focused on,\" Aguilar said. ",

    "body": "Pokemon \"Pikachu Illustrator\" Trainer Promo Hologram Trading CardSource: Ha.ComSocial media influencer and wrestler Logan Paul made history last week when he auctioned and sold a rare Pokémon card for $16.5 million, a world record price for an auctioned trading card. The winner views it as an investment.AJ Scaramucci — son of investor and former White House communications director Anthony Scaramucci — won the bidding war for the \"Pikachu Illustrator\" card, made in 1998 and one of only an estimated few dozen to exist. It's the crowning achievement in the Solari Capital founder's short collecting career, which started with trading cards during the COVID-19 pandemic. \"I mean, Picassos are great,\" he said in an interview, explaining the Illustrator card's importance. \"But Pokémon means way more than just a Picasso painting to people.\"After winning, Scaramucci said the card's purchase was the first action in what will be, as he dubbed, a \"planetary treasure hunt.\" He said the goal, which he is embarking on with his younger brother, is to collect a number of real-world, scarce assets across varying categories. Trading card markets have exploded in recent years. According to data from Card Ladder, an analytics firm that tracks trading card prices and sales, the monthly sales volume in secondary trading has nearly doubled in the last two years.EBay CEO Jamie Iannone in the company's earnings call last week detailed that the largest contributor to gross merchandise volume growth in the fourth-quarter were collectibles, particularly \"driven by continued strength in trading cards.\"Paul himself bought the illustrator card in 2021 for nearly $5.3 million, indicating he sold it with a more than 200% return. Card Ladder's \"Pokémon index\" has grown 145% in the past year. Compare those gains to the S&P 500, which is up 15.2% in the past year. Or compare it to \"Magnificent Seven\" darling Alphabet, which is up 73.4% in the past year. \"Especially in 2025, the growth has been astronomical,\" said Ken Goldin, founder and CEO of Goldin Auctions, which is owned by eBay. Goldin ran the auction for the illustrator card last week. \"We have people who are buying solely either because they absolutely love it or they firmly believe that trading cards and collectibles are a legitimate alternative asset class.\"AJ Scaramucci, founder and Managing Partner at Solari Capital, speaks during the Skybridge Capital SALT New York 2021 conference in New York City, U.S., September 15, 2021.Brendan McDermid | ReutersScaramucci is someone who is buying Pokémon cards for both of those reasons: his own pleasure and the investment potential. \"The compounded annual growth rate of these cards is out of control,\" he said. \"And they should be treated as investments because that's what they are. It's just obvious.\"Scaramucci added the cards are a way to play the \"debasement trade,\" where investors fearful of countries devaluing their currencies move money into hard assets. Viewing collectibles as an alternative asset is not new, even if unorthodox. Other collectibles like wine and art have been used in the past for portfolio diversification.Photo: Image Source | Getty ImagesPaul Karger, co-founder and managing partner at wealth advisory firm TwinFocus, said he works with clients who collect art, wine, watches and even guitars. But while some view these items as investments, Karger wouldn't advise clients to get into that mentality. \"Think of it as a passion first, and kind of an investment second,\" he said. \"You hope they go up over time, but they're absolutely not a replacement to financial assets, it's just maybe a complement at the margin.\"Karger warned that the illiquid nature of collectibles, and the dependency they have on others determining their worth, often via auctions, are added risks. Kaycee LeCong, managing director of the family office at Brighton Jones Wealth Management, also noted a risk is that capital gains on collectibles are taxed at 28%, higher than capital gains taxes on stocks that are around 15% and 20%.Despite the risks, Goldin projects more people will view collectibles, particularly trading cards, as alternative assets. He said as more headlines come about detailing major sales — like that of Paul's — and price discovery becomes easier to do with more data, it will only attract more participants. Scaramucci will embark on his treasure hunt through a new company called Treasure Trove. However, he did not disclose any details about what that company will be nor how it will operate, beyond that it will receive funding from Solari Capital. Scaramucci also didn't disclose if he plans to sell the Illustrator card, or any other of his collectibles, if it grows more in value. And while Scaramucci said he'd like to obtain the Declaration of Independence as part of his hunt after he won the Illustrator card, he acknowledged to CNBC that it's a goal that will take much work to achieve while not addressing a plan on how to do it. But at the moment, the lack of clarity in his future plans is the point. \"For now, if you think I'm just a crazy person buying up real-world, scarce assets,\" he said, \"that's all you need to know.\"",

Samsung Electronics, which has been a decades-old partner of Nvidia, was up about 5%.\"This is a positive read through for many of the Asia supply chain players including SK Hynix, Samsung, and many others given the explosion of data center demand,\" said Dan Ives,  senior equity research analyst at Wedbush Securities.Other South Korean tech stocks also rose, with components manufacturer LG Innotek surging almost 14%, while Seoul Semiconductor soared 13%.In Japan, the TOPIX Information & Communication index climbed 2.6%, building on previous day's 0.58% gain. Software firm Trend Micro jumped 5.95%, while Sony Group rose over 3.86%. SoftBank Group added 5%. Andrew Jackson, head of Japanese equity strategy at ORTUS Advisors, said that flows will continue to favor AI-linked names, suggesting potential upside for Japanese gallium nitride and silicon carbide plays such as Fuji Electric, as investors position for sustained data-center buildouts. The company's shares were up 1.7%.Nvidia reported that revenue for its fiscal fourth quarter climbed 73% to $68.13 billion from a year earlier, beating analysts' estimates for $66.21 billion. The company now gets over 91% of sales from its data center unit, which houses its market-leading artificial intelligence chips.Dan Niles, portfolio manager at Niles Investment Management, said the current setup still favors semiconductor infrastructure names over software, noting Nvidia remains \"really the king of the infrastructure for all of this.Japanese chip firms Advantest and Renesas, however, were 2.35% and 1.75% lower, respectively.",

What has emerged about Epstein's appalling conduct, the harm that he has caused to so many people, makes my association with him all the more painful and inexcusable.\"This photo illustration shows redacted documents from the Epstein Library files released by the Department of Justice in Washington, Feb. 18, 2026.Brendan Smialowski | Afp | Getty ImagesAxel has not been accused of wrongdoing in connection with his friendship with Epstein, who died in August 2019 from suicide, weeks after being arrested on federal child sex trafficking charges.But Axel is mentioned in multiple emails and other documents released by the Department of Justice in January as having been in contact and dining with Epstein.Axel has been a Columbia University professor for 53 years, and will continue his lab's research at the Zuckerman institute, he said. Axel, in his statement, said he will resign as an investigator from Columbia's Howard Hughes Medical InstituteAxel won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 2004 with Linda Buck \"for their discoveries of odorant receptors and the organization of the olfactory system,\" the prize website notes.In a December 2007 New York magazine profile of Epstein, Axel is quoted saying about him, \"He has the ability to make connections that other minds can't make.\"\"He is extremely smart and probing. He can very quickly acquire information to think about a problem and also to identify biological problems without having all the data that a scientist would have,\" Axel said in the article. \"He also has an extremely short attention span.\"The article, which was published as Epstein faced a pending indictment for soliciting prostitution in Florida, notes that Axel met Epstein \"during the early biotech days of the eighties.\"Read more CNBC politics coverageState of the Union 2026 recap: Trump touted economic gainsEpstein files: Trump sexual abuse claims withheld by DOJSenators tell CFTC prediction market contracts need clear guidanceDemocrats seek to force refunds after Supreme Court blocks Trump tariffsTrump demands Netflix fire Susan Rice as DOJ probes Warner dealAxel joins a growing list of people who have lost positions or been subpoenaed due to their relationships with Epstein.Emails and other documents contained in the DOJ's Epstein files database show that the friendship between Axel and Epstein continued for years after Epstein served 13 months in jail following his guilty plea in Florida state court to soliciting an underage girl for prostitution.Columbia, in its own statement on Tuesday, said, \"The University has seen no evidence that Dr. Axel violated any University policy or the law. However, Dr. Axel made clear that in light of this past association, and the continued fallout from the release of DOJ files, he felt it appropriate to relinquish his position as co-director.\"The University agrees with this decision, while at the same time recognizing his extraordinary contributions to the University and his dedication to his colleagues, to his students, and to science,\" the university said.",

Discovery as Paramount ratchets up its rival bid, Politico reported Wednesday.The reported visit is set to occur five days after President Donald Trump demanded that Netflix immediately fire former Obama administration official Susan Rice from its board, or else \"pay the consequences.\"It was not immediately clear if Sarandos would be meeting with Trump during the visit, a person familiar with the discussions told Politico.Netflix declined CNBC's request for comment on the report. The White House, asked by CNBC to confirm the visit, said, \"We do not discuss private meetings that may or may not be happening.\"The acquisition fight over WBD, like numerous other business deals in over the past year, has been entangled with presidential politics.Trump had weeks earlier said he would stay out of the multibillion-dollar bidding war between Netflix, which wants to buy WBD's studio and streaming brands, and Paramount, which seeks to acquire WBD's whole business.But Trump appeared to change course when, in a Truth Social post on Saturday afternoon, he demanded that Netflix fire Rice from its board, calling her \"racist\" and a \"political hack.\"Trump on Truth Social linked to an X post from Laura Loomer, a far-right media figure in Trump's orbit, slamming Rice and urging the president to \"kill the Netflix-Warner Bros. merger now.\"Loomer's post highlighted a recent podcast appearance in which Rice, who has served in the Obama, Clinton and Biden administrations, predicted that corporations and other institutions that appeased Trump will be held \"accountable\" when his political opposition regains power.Read more CNBC politics coverageState of the Union 2026 recap: Trump touted economic gainsEpstein files: Trump sexual abuse claims withheld by DOJSenators tell CFTC prediction market contracts need clear guidanceDemocrats seek to force refunds after Supreme Court blocks Trump tariffsTrump demands Netflix fire Susan Rice as DOJ probes Warner dealThe WBD deal proposals have raised antitrust concerns.

    "body": "Prospective buyers arrive during an open house at a home in Seattle, Washington, US, on Sunday, Jan. 18, 2026.David Ryder | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesMortgage rates dropped sharply last week, and while that helped to prolong gains in refinancing, homebuyer demand seemed unimpressed.Total mortgage application volume was essentially flat, rising just 0.4% compared with the previous week, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association's seasonally adjusted index. The average contract interest rate for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages with conforming loan balances, $832,750 or less, decreased to 6.09% from 6.17%, with points falling to 0.53 from 0.56, including the origination fee, for loans with a 20% down payment. That was the lowest level since September 2022. Applications to refinance a home loan increased 4% last week from the week before and were 150% higher than the same week one year ago, when rates were 79 basis points higher. Refinancing has been on a bit of a tear lately, as rates drop. While the comparisons to a year ago are quite large, it is important to take into account that refinancing was quite low at this time last year. Applications for a mortgage to purchase a home dropped 5% for the week and were 12% higher year over year. While lower mortgage rates are improving affordability, home prices are still slightly higher than they were at this time last year and economic uncertainty is weighing heavily on consumers.

That's up from 13.1% a year ago and the highest January share in records dating to 2017.Borrowers also sought more savings in adjustable-rate mortgages, which are slightly riskier but offer lower rates. \"The ARM share stayed above 8 percent, as ARM rates remained more than 80 basis points below conforming fixed rates,\" said Joel Kan, an MBA economist, in a release. \"This is giving payment-sensitive borrowers or those seeking larger loans, an incentive to choose this product offering.\" watch now",

    "body": "Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff during the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Jan. 20, 2026.Krisztian Bocsi | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesSalesforce shares tumbled 5% in extended trading on Wednesday after the customer service software maker reported healthy results, although its fiscal 2027 revenue view trailed Wall Street projections.Here's how the company did in comparison with LSEG consensus:Earnings per share: $3.81 adjusted vs. $3.04 expectedRevenue: $11.20 billion vs. $11.18 billion expectedSalesforce's revenue grew 12% year over year in its fiscal fourth quarter, which ended on Jan. 31, according to a statement. It's the company's fastest growth rate in two years.The company has allocated $50 billion for new share buybacks, \"because these are some low prices,\" CEO Marc Benioff said on a conference call with analysts. As of Wednesday's close, Salesforce shares had fallen about 28% so far in 2026, while the S&P 500 index had gained 1%.Net income of $1.94 billion, or $2.07 per share, increased from $1.71 billion, or $1.75 per share. Adjusted earnings per share excludes stock-based compensation expense, amortization of purchased intangible assets and restructuring costs.Current remaining performance obligation, a sum of contracted but unrecognized revenue and unbilled amounts that will be recognized as revenue over the next year, came in at $35.1 billion. The figure was higher than StreetAccount's $34.53 billion consensus.Guidance for the fiscal first quarter included $3.11 to $3.13 in adjusted earnings per share on $11.03  billion to $11.08 billion in revenue. Analysts surveyed by LSEG were looking for $3.00 per share and $10.99 billion in revenue.For the 2027 fiscal year, Salesforce called for $13.11 to $13.19 in adjusted earnings per share on $45.8 billion to $46.2 billion in revenue, which implies 10% to 11% growth. The LSEG consensus had $13.12 per share on $46.06 billion in revenue.

On Monday, IBM stock dropped 13% in its worst daily performance since 2000 after Anthropic published a blog post saying its Claude Code AI tool for developers can assist with modernizing code written in the Cobol programming language.During the quarter, Salesforce released an AI-enabled Slackbot assistant in its Slack team communication app for paying clients. The company also completed its $8 billion Informatica acquisition and announced plans to buy marketing company Qualified. Informatica, a data management software company, contributed $399 million in revenue during the quarter.The company now sees $63 billion in fiscal 2030 revenue, up from a target of over $60 billion it presented in October. Analysts polled by LSEG had been looking for $59.07 billion. The new number includes a contribution from Informatica.Five customers of ServiceNow moved to Salesforce's competing product for information technology service management during the quarter, Benioff said on the TBPN podcast on Wednesday.Salesforce has been working to expand adoption of its Agentforce AI technology for automating customer service and other corporate functions. The company said annualized Agentforce revenue exceeded $800 million in the quarter. Morgan Stanley analysts, with the equivalent of a buy rating on Salesforce stock, said in a Monday note to clients that conversations with partners \"continue to indicate we are in the early innings.\"Meanwhile, Salesforce is seeing a benefit from its stake in Anthropic, generating an $811 million gain on strategic investments in the quarter. That's up from $96 million in the year-ago quarter.\"I think we just put another $100 million into the new round,\" Benioff said. We're [at] about $330 million into Anthropic invested. It's almost about 1% of Anthropic. And believe me, I wish we had invested a lot more.\"Benioff said the company isn't doing all that it can with debt.\"We're just very under-leveraged on our balance sheet,\" he said.WATCH: Investors are paying less and less for software earnings these days, says Jim Cramerwatch now",

    "body": "Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang speaks during the 2026 CES event in Las Vegas, Jan. 6, 2026.Bridget Bennett | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesNvidia CEO Jensen Huang said Wednesday that the dispute between the U.S. Defense Department and Anthropic is \"not the end of the world.\" His comments come after U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth gave Anthropic until Friday to loosen its rules on how the Pentagon can use its AI tools, or risk losing its government contract.If Anthropic fails to comply, Hegseth threatened to label the company a \"supply chain risk\" or invoke the Defense Production Act, sources told CNBC's Ashley Capoot and Kate Rooney earlier this week.Speaking to CNBC's Becky Quick on Wednesday, Huang said that the Defense Department has the right to use the technology and use the products that they procure in a way that serves their interests. Likewise, Anthropic has the right to decide how they would like to market their products and what kind of use cases they could be used for. \"So I think they both have their reasonable perspective,\" he said. Anthropic's negotiations with the Department of Defense have stalled because it is seeking assurance that its models will not be used for autonomous weapons or mass surveillance of Americans. The Department of Defense, meanwhile, wants the company to agree to \"all lawful use cases\" without limitation.\"I hope that they can work it out, but if it doesn't get worked out, it's also not the end of the world,\" Huang said, noting that Anthropic is not the only AI company in the world and the Department of Justice is not the only customer. Anthropic was founded in 2021 by a group of former OpenAI researchers and executives, and it's best known for developing a family of AI models called Claude. The company was awarded a $200 million contract with the DoD last year.Anthropic and Nvidia signed a strategic partnership in November. The Claude maker adopted Nvidia's technology architecture and received a $5 billion investment commitment from the chip designer.— CNBC's Ashley Capoot and Kate Rooney contributed to this storywatch now",

    "body": "Liubomyr Vorona | Istock | Getty ImagesThe prospect of being replaced by artificial intelligence is helping to scare higher-income workers and leading them to stay in their jobs longer, according to several recent surveys.One closely followed gauge, the University of Michigan Survey of Consumers, show confidence in the labor market among high earners around its historic lows going back to the late-1970s. Likewise, the New York Federal Reserve's monthly consumer survey shows unemployment angst also around record highs.Finally, payrolls processing firm ADP notes that turnover among traditionally white-collar occupations is around record lows.The reason for the trend? \"Our guess is partially 'AI fear', as white collar jobs are possibly at greater risk, but we are open to other explanations,\" UBS chief economist Arend Kapteyn said in a note. The rise of AI is causing both excitement and fear among investors, employers and workers alike. Policymakers also are trying to gauge the impact of the new technology and how it will fit into the economy.\"In my lifetime, I have never seen a technological revolution like this — and I have seen the birth of space exploration, the rise of the personal computer, the explosion of the internet and then smartphones,\" Fed Governor Christopher Waller said Tuesday. \"Firms, households, and every government [agency] are all trying to incorporate it into the way they function and operate.\"watch nowFor the moment, AI appears to be contributing to angst and caution.Over the past year, the University of Michigan survey has found a general decline in sentiment over the labor market. However, it's been most pronounced among the top one-third of earners, whose sentiment score on the labor market, in this case expectations for a higher unemployment rate, to be at its lowest level since the financial crisis ended in 2009. Sentiment among lower-income workers also has declined but is actually higher than those at the top end.Likewise, the New York Fed's month Survey of Consumer Expectations is showing that expectations of finding a job in three months if one loses their job today is around the lowest for a data sent that stretches to mid-2013.And ADP's extensive data on the private jobs picture shows that professions such as finance and information and business services is showing reduced turnover rate. In January, turnover for professional and business services was the lowest the firm ever recorded.\"The normal push-and-pull of job gains and pay growth — quantity and price — that once kept the labor market dynamic has weakened, giving way to a market defined more by inactivity than vigor,\" said Nela Richardson, chief economist at ADP.To be sure, the jobs picture is still very strong for higher-income groups.While the Bureau of Labor Statistics does not break out the unemployment rate by income, it does classify it by profession. Finance, for instance, had a jobless level of just 2.1% in January, close to the same level a year ago. Professional and business services was somewhat elevated at 4.5%, but down 0.4 percentage point from January 2025.\"We immediately jump to the notion that a bunch ⁠of people are going to ‌be displaced\" by AI, Richmond Fed President Thomas Barkin ‌said at an event Wednesday. \"We should also remember ⁠people are going ⁠to be enabled.\"Similarly, Kansas City Fed President Jeffrey Schmid said in the long run, AI will be a benefit to the labor market and the economy.\"I personally think we're going to need AI to supplement the fact that we aren't having new entrants into the labor market like we did, let's say 30 years ago or 40 years ago,\" Schmid said during a separate event Wednesday. \"So AI is going to have to be an enhancement to do jobs.\"",

    "body": "watch nowThe major technology companies will meet President Donald Trump at the White House next week to sign a pledge that they will supply their own power for artificial intelligence data centers. Amazon, Google, Meta, Microsoft, xAI, Oracle and OpenAI will sign the agreement at the March 4 meeting, a White House official confirmed to CNBC Wednesday.\"Under this bold initiative, these massive companies will build, bring, or buy their own power supply for new AI data centers, ensuring that Americans' electricity bills will not increase as demand grows,\" White House spokeswoman Taylor Rogers told CNBC. Fox News first reported the development. Trump said during his State of the Union address Tuesday that he had secured such a pledge from the tech sector, but did not provide detail on what the agreement entails. \"We're telling the major tech companies that they have the obligation to provide for their own power needs,\" the president said. \"They can build their own power plants as part of their factory so that no one's prices will go up.\"Data centers are facing opposition in communities across the U.S. as people blame rising utility bills on the facilities' huge electricity consumption.The Trump administration has closely embraced the AI industry as an engine of economic growth and a pillar of U.S. national security. It is an alliance that poses political risks for the White House ahead of the midterm elections. New Jersey Gov. Mikie Sherrill and Virginia Gov. Abigail Spanberger defeated their Republican opponents in landslide elections last November by campaigning against rising electricity prices.The Trump administration has warned the tech companies that they risk a backlash if the public believes their data centers are driving up energy costs, Energy Secretary Chris Wright said Wednesday. \"We want to see data centers developed,\" Wright told reporters on a call. \"We want to see them rapidly sited. We want to see communities welcoming them, but to do that, it's necessary to have up-front investments in the additional grid infrastructure needed.\" ",

He and Melinda French, who once were co-chairs of the foundation, divorced in 2021.\"In the conversation, Bill answered questions submitted by foundation staff on a range of issues, including the release of the Epstein files, the foundation's work in AI, and the future of global health,\" a Gates Foundation representative told CNBC in an email. \"In the townhall, Bill spoke candidly, addressing several questions in detail, and took responsibility for his actions.\"Read more CNBC tech newsFirst look at Nvidia's new AI system Vera Rubin is 10 times more efficient than its predecessorSamsung's S26 gives an advance look at what the Google-powered Apple Siri could doThrive Capital invested about $1 billion in OpenAI at a $285 billion valuation, source saysHead of Amazon's AGI lab is leaving the companyPoliticians, academics and business executives have been implicated in the millions of pages of documents the Justice Department released in January, leading some to give up their roles. Earlier this week Dr. Peter Attia resigned from his position as a CBS News contributor after he said the Epstein emails involving him were \"embarrassing, tasteless, and indefensible.\"For years, Gates has maintained that it was a mistake to be involved with the disgraced former financier. Last week, the foundation said Gates would not appear at an artificial intelligence summit in India as planned. In new documents released by the Department of Justice that included a trove of emails, Gates and Epstein discuss philanthropic fundraising, Microsoft's CEO search and even a $1 bet about the performance of the euro. The emails describe meetings with foundation staff that were then passed on to Epstein, who sometimes gave suggestions on how to proceed.Gates' new comments came weeks after the foundation said that \"on the basis of Epstein's claims that he could mobilize significant philanthropic resources for global health and development, a small number of foundation employees interacted with Epstein to try to secure this potential funding.\" The foundation said it never paid Epstein and no fund was ever created.\"The harm Epstein inflicted on women and girls was horrific, and no one should ever have to experience what they did,\" the statement said.WATCH: Top Goldman Sachs attorney steps down: Here's what to knowwatch now",

    "body": "South Korea's central bank raised its key interest rate by a quarter-percentage point as expected on Thursday, in a bid to contain inflation and prevent capital outflows as the U.S. Federal Reserve gears up for more hikes.Jung Yeon-je | Afp | Getty ImagesJapan's Nikkei 225 hit another record Thursday fueled by \"Takaichi trade,\" while the broader Asia-Pacific markets mostly climbed after tech stocks powered a Wall Street rally overnight.The Nikkei 225 rose 1.1%, to an all-time high of 59,199.31, extending its winning streak of record highs to a third straight session. The broader Topix added 1.45%, also scaling a new peak. On Wednesday, the Japanese government tapped Ayano Sato of Aoyama Gakuin University and Toichiro Asada of Chuo University as central bank board members, both dovish in their policy stance which aligns with Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi's approach as well. The two will succeed outgoing central bank board members Asahi Noguchi and Junko Nakagawa, whose terms expire at the end of March and in June, respectively.Japanese equities have scaled multiple record highs recently, buoyed by the so-called \"Takaichi trade,\" as investors bet that the prime minister's growth-oriented policies — viewed as an extension of Abenomics — will lift stocks while pressuring the yen through looser monetary policy and increased fiscal spending.South Korea's Kospi rose 1.65%, while the small-cap Kosdaq advanced 0.57%.Australia's S&P/ASX 200 gained 0.8%, also hitting a record high in early trade.Hong Kong Hang Seng index fell 0.62%, while the CSI 300 lost 0.2%.The Bank of Korea left its base rate unchanged at 2.5%, in line with Reuters' expectations.Asian tech stocks rallied as stronger-than-expected results from Nvidia eased concerns that momentum in artificial intelligence sector was cooling.Shares of South Korean chipmaking giants Samsung Electronics and SK Hynix jumped in early trade.SK Hynix, which is a key supplier of high-bandwidth memory used in AI applications to Nvidia, rose over 2%. Samsung Electronics, which has been a decades-old partner of Nvidia, was up about 5%.Other South Korean tech stocks also rose, with components manufacturer LG Innotek surging almost 14%, while Seoul Semiconductor soared 13%. In Japan, the TOPIX Information & Communication index climbed 2.6%, building on previous day's 0.58% gain. Overnight in the U.S., equities rose, supported by Nvidia and Oracle, as stocks built on the gains from the prior trading day.The S&P 500 added 0.81% to close at 6,946.13, and the Nasdaq Composite advanced 1.26% to 23,152.08. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 307.65 points, or 0.63%, to settle at 49,482.15.Nvidia posted fiscal fourth-quarter results that topped Wall Street expectations, fueled by a 75% surge in revenue from its core data center segment. Shares gained as much as 2% in extended trading following the release.The company reported adjusted earnings per share of $1.62, beating the $1.53 forecast from analysts surveyed by LSEG. Revenue totaled $68.13 billion, above estimates of $66.21 billion.—CNBC's Sean Conlon and Pia Singh contributed to this report.",

    "body": "Jensen Huang, chief executive officer of Nvidia Corp., speaks during the 2026 CES event in Las Vegas, Nevada, US, on Tuesday, Jan. 6, 2026. Siemens and Nvidia announced an expansion of their strategic partnership to develop industrial and physical AI solutions to bring AI-driven innovation to industrial workflow. Photographer: Bridget Bennett/Bloomberg via Getty ImagesBloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesNvidia just reported its 11th straight quarter of revenue growth above 55% as the leading tech names keep snapping up the company's AI chips. Already the world's most valuable public company, growth is now reaccelerating.In its earnings report Wednesday, Nvidia said year-over-year revenue will surge about 77% this quarter to roughly $78 billion. That would mark the fastest growth rate for any period since the quarter ending January 2025, when expansion came in slightly higher at 78%. Its forecast sailed past the $72.6 billion average analyst estimate, according to LSEG.Revenue in the fourth quarter jumped 73%, also topping estimates, following expansion of 62% in the prior period. The data center business, home to Nvidia's AI graphics processing units, now accounts for over 91% of sales.The chipmaker's optimistic outlook comes as the company ramps production of Vera Rubin, its next rack-scale system for AI that will succeed Grace Blackwell. Nvidia says the system's 72 next-generation Rubin graphics processing units (GPUs) are expected to deliver 10 times more performance per watt, compared to their predecessors. watch nowFinance chief Colette Kress said on the earnings call after the report that the company shipped its \"first Vera Rubin samples to customers earlier this week,\" and that Nvidia expects every model builder and cloud provider to eventually deploy the system. She said the company now expects growth this year to exceed what was included in the company's projection last year for a $500 billion revenue opportunity between Blackwell and Rubin. \"We believe we have inventory and supply commitments in place to address future demand, including shipments extending into calendar 2027,\" Kress said. Nvidia's shares were little changed in extended trading after initially popping, reflecting investors' lofty expectations for the company, which is valued at almost $5 trillion thanks to its dominance in AI processors.There's competition on the horizon, as smaller rival Advanced Micro Devices is set to release Helios, its first rack-scale system for AI, later this year. Earlier this week, Meta committed to deploying up to 6 gigawatts of AMD GPUs, with Helios shipments starting in 2026.Nvidia also faces challenges from some of its biggest customers — namely Amazon and Google — making in-house AI chips to power their data centers. In its annual filing, Nvidia said a potential risk to future results is that \"customers develop their own internal solution.\"Looking beyond fiscal 2027, growth is expected to slow dramatically, from 63% this year to 30%, 11.5% and 3% in the three subsequent years, according to LSEG. 'Compute equals revenue'But for now, Nvidia's growth is far outpacing any of its competitors or peers as tech giants and AI model developers race to build out their infrastructure to meet soaring demand. \"In this new world of AI, compute equals revenues,\" CEO Jensen Huang said on Wednesday's earnings call. He repeated the phrase and variations of it several times during the call, in reference to the speedy adoption of agentic AI, which goes beyond early generative AI by allowing businesses to create and run applications with text prompts. Anthropic's Claude Cowork has quickly taken off in the enterprise by plugging into more applications. And earlier this month, OpenAI hired OpenClaw developer Peter Steinberger after his tool surged in popularity by automating tasks such as managing emails and calendars, browsing the web and interacting with online services.\"Between Claude Cowork and OpenClaw, compute demand is skyrocketing, and the ChatGPT moment of agentic AI has arrived,\" Huang said on the call.Not included in Nvidia's first-quarter forecast is any potential data center revenue from China. A lack of clarity around export controls has kept Nvidia from selling into the world's second-largest economy, even after President Donald Trump said in January that his administration would approve China sales of Nvidia's H200 chip, with the U.S. government taking 25% of sales. Huang said in May that China's AI market would likely reach about $50 billion within two to three years, and that missing out on it would be a \"tremendous loss.\" It's an opportunity that hasn't yet opened up.\"While small amounts of H200 products for China-based customers were approved by the U.S. government, we have yet to generate any revenue and we do not know whether any imports will be allowed into China,\" Kress said on the call. \"We are not assuming any data center compute revenue from China in our outlook.\"WATCH: 'Fast Money' traders react to Nvidia quarterly resultswatch now",

    "body": "The logo of pharmaceutical company Novo Nordisk is displayed in front of its offices in Bagsvaerd, Copenhagen, Denmark, February 4, 2026. Tom Little | ReutersNovo Nordisk on Monday said it is suing online telehealth provider Hims & Hers for mass marketing cheaper, unapproved copies of the drugmaker's new Wegovy obesity pill and injections in the U.S. Novo is asking the court to permanently ban Hims from selling compounded versions of its drugs that infringe on the company's patents, and is seeking to recover damages. In a release, Novo accused Hims of \"deceiving patients and putting their health at risk,\" as the safety, efficacy and quality of those copies are not verified by U.S. regulators.The move escalates the feud between Novo and Hims, which said on Saturday it will stop offering its new obesity pill copycat after facing scrutiny from federal regulators and legal threats from the Danish drugmaker. Hims had planned to offer the oral drug for as little as $49 for the first month, roughly $100 less than Novo's approved Wegovy pill. Novo Nordisk's Copenhagen-listed shares were up 7.1% while Hims' NYSE-listed stock was down 19% in premarket as of 7 a.m. ET.The lawsuit comes as Novo works to reclaim market share in the booming obesity drug market and fend off competition from both Eli Lilly and a wave of compounded alternatives. Those copycats have proliferated under a regulatory loophole that allows companies like Hims to sell compounded versions of patent-protected drugs when branded treatments are in short supply.Semaglutide — the active ingredient in Novo's pill and its blockbuster injections — is no longer in shortage in the U.S., thanks to the company's efforts to ramp up manufacturing capacity. There are no shortages reported for the Wegovy pill, which has had an explosive launch since it entered the U.S. market in early January. Even so, Novo estimated in January that as many as 1.5 million Americans are using compounded GLP-1 drugs.Hims has said its compounded pill and other GLP-1 products contain semaglutide, despite the ingredient being protected by U.S. patents through 2032. Hims has said that its versions are legal because they are \"personalized\" in dosage.But Novo said it does not directly or indirectly sell semaglutide for copycats, and accused Hims of engaging in illegal mass compounding. Hims is \"mass marketing unapproved knock-off versions of [Wegovy and Ozempic] that evade the FDA's gold standard review process – that's dangerous and deceptive to patients, and undermines the scientific innovation and regulatory rigor in place to ensure these treatments are safe and effective,\" said John Kuckelman, Novo's senior vice president of general counsel, global legal, IP and security, in a release. On Friday, the Food and Drug Administration announced it planned to take legal action against Hims for the pill, including restricting access to the ingredients and referring the company to the Department of Justice over potential violations.Novo and Lilly have aggressively cracked down on compounding pharmacies over the last two years as they benefit from the soaring popularity of their weight-loss and diabetes drugs. Lilly has gone through a similar legal process with tirzepatide, the active ingredient in its weight loss drug Zepbound and diabetes treatment Mounjaro, which is no longer in short supply in the U.S.",

    "body": "Printed documents available at Epstein Library on the U.S. Department of Justice website are seen in this illustration photo.Nurphoto | Nurphoto | Getty ImagesThe U.S. Justice Department's latest release of millions of documents related to the notorious sex criminal and financier Jeffrey Epstein has shed more light on the relationships he built with various influential figures, including many from the American tech industry.Notably, the files reference communications and meetings involving tech mogul Elon Musk and Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, two of the world's wealthiest people. This has led to much scrutiny of the pair in recent weeks, both of whom have denied any wrongdoing related to Epstein.But those two billionaires are not the only tech names to appear repeatedly in the trove of new documents. Other tech leaders named include Google co-founder Sergey Brin, venture capitalist Peter Thiel, former Microsoft executive Steven Sinofsky, and LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman.While those four have been linked to Epstein in the past, the new disclosures reveal more than previously known about their association with the convicted sex offender through records ranging from emails, schedules and photos.Brin and Sinofsky have not commented on the matter, while Theil and Hoffman have said they only associated with Epstein for legal and legitimate purposes.Authorities have stressed that being named in the records does not indicate evidence of wrongdoing nor prove that the name was part of a purported client list or blackmail scheme.Still, the files help paint a picture of Epstein's longstanding efforts to embed himself within — and sometimes become a confidant and power-broker for — some of Silicon Valley's most powerful circles prior to his death in 2019Peter Thiel, PayPal and Palantir co-founder Peter Thiel, a venture capitalist and co-founder of Palantir and PayPal, where he once worked alongside Elon Musk, also appears in the Epstein files, with the latest release showing correspondence between and about the two.Those communications began around 2014 and lasted until around 2019, just months before Epstein was arrested on federal sex trafficking charges, and well after he was first formally charged with sex-related crimes in 2006.Among the materials is a recording of an undated conversation between Epstein and former Israeli prime minister Ehud Barak, in which Epstein references Thiel.In the recording, Epstein advised Barak on how to leverage his connections to get a lucrative position at a company, floating Palantir as a potential option. He added that he had not yet met Thiel but hoped to see him the following week.The duo would indeed get better acquainted, with emails over the years including meeting plans, discussions about the Trump campaign, and other informal exchanges. Ahead of one planned meeting, Thiel's team had even sent his dietary details to Epstein's staff. Peter Thiel, a venture capitalist and co-founder of Palantir and PayPal, appeared in the Epstein files, with the latest release showing correspondence between and about the two.Stephanie Keith | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesFiles released by the House Oversight Committee in November 2025 also showed Epstein invited Thiel to visit him in \"the Caribbean.\"In response to CNBC's request for comment, a representative for Thiel said the venture capitalist never visited Epstein's infamous private island in the Virgin Islands.The New York Times reported in June that Epstein, in 2015 and 2016, had invested $40 million in two funds managed by a venture capital firm co-founded by Thiel.In a podcast appearance that aired on Aug. 16, 2024, Thiel discussed some of his encounters with Epstein, noting that he met him a few times starting in 2014, after being introduced by LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman.Thiel said the discussions centered on tax and financial advice. He added that he had underestimated the severity of Epstein's earlier crimes due to Epstein's lenient sentencing in 2008 and his trust in the judgment of his mutual connections.Reid Hoffman, LinkedIn co-founder The latest Epstein file releases feature many references to Reid Hoffman, who co-founded LinkedIn in 2002, with communications between the two showing several friendly email exchanges.While much of the correspondence centered on fundraising for MIT's Media Lab, it also included personal interactions, tax advice, meeting plans, and mentions of gifts Hoffman sent to Epstein. The documents also confirm a 2014 visit Hoffman made to Epstein's private island. Hoffman has previously acknowledged visiting the island, saying the trip was strictly for philanthropic purposes and that he later regretted not researching Epstein more thoroughly beforehand. However, other emails show plans for additional visits to Epstein's estates, including his Zorro Ranch in New Mexico and his Manhattan apartment, though it's unclear which of those trips actually occurred.  Hoffman recently confirmed 2016 meetings with Epstein in Palo Alto and Cambridge.Epstein is seen referring to Hoffman as a \"very close friend,\" and saying at one point that he missed seeing and talking to the internet entrepreneur. Emails in 2014 also show the financier trying to help connect Hoffman to investment opportunities in India.Reid Hoffman attends a conversation at 92NY on Jan. 28, 2025 in New York City. The latest Epstein file releases feature many references to Hoffman.Dominik Bindl | Getty Images Entertainment | Getty ImagesMeanwhile, a 2015 email from Epstein mentioned a dinner Hoffman hosted in Palo Alto, attended by Zuckerberg, Musk, Thiel, and MIT neuroscientist Ed Boyden.Hoffman connected Zuckerberg and Epstein via email after the event.  In response to an inquiry, Meta directed CNBC to a 2019 statement from a spokesperson, which stated that Zuckerberg did not communicate with Epstein again after the dinner.Hoffman did not respond to a CNBC request for comment. He has previously said he regrets his interactions with Epstein and has called for a full release of the Epstein files. The latest documents reviewed by CNBC contained no indications of criminal wrongdoing or involvement in Epstein's illicit activities.However, in November last year, President Donald Trump had ordered a DOJ investigation into Hoffman, a major Democratic donor, along with former president Bill Clinton and former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers.Trump framed the investigation as a probe of Democratic ties to Epstein, though some critics argued it was a deflection from Trump's own mentions in the files. Trump has confirmed a past friendship with Epstein, but said he had no knowledge of his crimes and broke off his relationship with him years ago.Sergey Brin, Google co-founder The file release also contains multiple references to Google co-founder Sergey Brin, including email communications.One particular email chain in April 2003 showed Brin communicating with Ghislaine Maxwell, Epstein's longtime companion and convicted co-conspirator, regarding potential dinner plans at Epstein's New York estate.The exchange appeared to follow up on an earlier encounter between the two. \"Dinners at Jeffrey's are always happily casual and relaxed. Look forward to seeing you,\" Maxwell wrote.  CNBC contacted Brin through Google for comment, but did not receive a response. Connections between Epstein and Brin have been previously documented, though no allegations of wrongdoing have been leveled.Sergey Brin at the 2024 Vanity Fair Oscar Party on March 10, 2024 in Beverly Hills, California. The Epstein file release contain multiple references to Google co-founder Sergey Brin, including email communications.Lionel Hahn | Getty Images Entertainment | Getty ImagesIn 2004, Epstein had allegedly referred Brin to JPMorgan Chase as a client and later connected him with bank executives for tax advice, per a complaint filed by the U.S. Virgin Islands government in a U.S. district court against JPMorgan Chase Bank. The U.S. Virgin Islands also subpoenaed Brin in March 2023 for documents related to Epstein's interactions with JPMorgan.Meanwhile, court documents unsealed in 2024 related to litigation involving Maxwell included exhibits in which Epstein accuser Sarah Ransome alleged she met Brin and his then fiancée, now ex-wife, Anne Wojcicki, on Epstein's island.Brin stepped down as president of Google's parent company, Alphabet, on Dec. 3, 2019, saying at the time that he was no longer needed in the role. However, he remained a controlling shareholder and board member.He returned from semi-retirement in late 2023 to actively contribute to the company's artificial intelligence initiatives, including work on Gemini.Steven Sinofsky, ex-Microsoft executive More details of the relationship between Epstein and Steven Sinofsky, a former Microsoft executive who oversaw key products like Windows and Office, were revealed in the latest files.The documents showed that Sinofsky had sought Epstein's advice on the terms of his exit from Microsoft after leaving in 2012.Sinofsky, who is now a board partner at venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, then emailed Epstein in September 2013, about three months after Microsoft announced the terms of his $14 million retirement agreement, writing: \"Got paid. You will be too :)\"Sinofsky continued to email Epstein through 2018, discussing his finances, career prospects and social events in New York, San Francisco and Seattle.Steven Sinofsky speaks at an event at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, Spain, on Feb. 29, 2012. More details of the relationship between Epstein and Sinofsky, a former Microsoft executive, were revealed in the latest files.Bloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesAn email exchange from November 2012 also appears to show Epstein referencing a possible meeting between Sinofsky and Apple's Tim Cook regarding job opportunities. In the email, Epstein appears to indicate he had recently spoken with Cook, saying \"tim cook was excited to meet\" with Sinofsky, though the context is unclear. Months later, Sinofsky would email Epstein about a meeting with Cook.Sinofsky declined to comment. Apple did not respond to a request for comment regarding the alleged Epstein-Cook interaction.Epstein's relationship with Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, who appears in earlier document releases, has also drawn intense scrutiny in recent weeks following mentions in the latest disclosures. Those included draft emails written to himself in which Epstein suggests that he had helped facilitate extramarital affairs and sexual encounters for Gates, amongst other things.In an interview with Australia's 9News on Wednesday, Gates denied any wrongdoing in relation to new files, calling Epstein's allegations \"absolutely absurd and completely false.\"He emphasized that his interactions with Epstein were limited to dinners aimed at potential philanthropy discussions, adding that he \"never went to the island\" and \"never met any women.\"",

    "body": "The Fulton County Election Hub and Operation Center a day after the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) executed a search warrant in relation to the 2020 election in Union City, Georgia, U.S. January 29, 2026. Elijah Nouvelage | ReutersA federal judge in Georgia ordered documents related to a Federal Bureau of Investigation raid on an election facility in Fulton County to be unsealed by Tuesday. The FBI raid that took place late last month was executed under a judicial warrant and resulted in troves of ballots from the 2020 election being taken into federal custody. Information related to the warrant including the affidavit must be unsealed by Tuesday, which could provide new details into the government's interest in obtaining the ballots.Fulton County Board of Commissioners Chair Robb Pitts and the Fulton County Board of Registration and Elections are suing the federal government over the seizure of the ballots, seeking their return. \"Although Petitioners originally filed this case under seal, both parties have now indicated to the Court that they do not oppose unsealing the docket or the motions filed by Petitioners,\" wrote Judge J.P.

Trump and his allies vehemently denied that he lost the 2020 election to former President Joe Biden, an assertion that has proven to be false. Fulton County was central to now-debunked claims of election fraud, with the president and his surrogates continuing to make allegations of fraud to this day despite a hand recount affirming Biden's victory in the state. Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard's appearance at the Georgia raid has only added to speculation, with the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee denouncing the appearance. Virginia Sen. Mark Warner and other Democrats have warned that Trump may attempt to meddle in the 2026 midterm elections.\"When you put all of this together, it is clear that what happened in Fulton County is not about revisiting the past, it is about shaping the outcome of future elections,\" Warner said last week. Gabbard has defended her appearance at the election center, writing in a letter to Warner that it was \"requested\" by Trump and that she only observed the operation \"for a brief period of time.\" Trump later said at the National Prayer Breakfast on Thursday that it was actually Attorney General Pam Bondi who insisted Gabbard oversee the raid.Trump recently has been calling for a federal takeover of elections. States and local government typically run elections without interference from the federal government.",

    "body": "Cheng Xin | Getty ImagesLyft on Monday officially launched teen accounts nationwide in a bid to match competitor Uber.CEO David Risher addressed Lyft's delayed teen accounts rollout, saying the company \"wanted to get it right\" and is distinguishing itself with parent and driver communication tools. \"We've been really thoughtful as we've talked to parents and teens to come up with a product that meets what they both want,\" he said. The new program will match passengers between 13 and 17 with drivers, and includes safety features such as pin verification, real-time tracking and recordings. Risher said the drivers who can transport teens require a high star rating and cannot be blocked by a \"significant\" number of riders.Bloomberg first reported the news that the company was working on the feature last month. Following the report, Risher confirmed on X that Lyft would launch teen accounts early this year in hundreds of cities nationwide. Lyft rival Uber rolled out teen accounts nationwide in May 2023. Last year, Uber said it had expanded the offering to more than 50 countries.Read more CNBC tech newsGoogle and Microsoft offer lucrative deals to promote AI, but even $500,000 won't sway some creatorsNvidia shares rise 8% as Jensen Huang says $660 billion capex buildout is sustainableAmazon leads Big Tech's $1 trillion wipeout as AI bubble fears ignite sell-offWhy Amazon's CEO is 'confident' with $200 billion spending planIn recent months, Lyft has been breaking into new markets. Last year, it bought European taxi app Freenow for about $200 million and acquired a global chauffeuring service. But Lyft is also facing massive competition as ridesharing adds more and more driverless rides. So far, Alphabet-backed Waymo, which started its own teen accounts last summer, has led the charge in the U.S. with operations in major markets such as San Francisco, Los Angeles and Phoenix. CNBC reported in December that Waymo surpassed 450,000 paid rides and the cars are testing in New York City with a human in the driver's seat.Uber has teamed up with Waymo and signed a six-year robotaxi deal with Lucid and autonomous vehicle startup Nuro in July. Tesla launched a robotaxi pilot in Austin last year and recently began testing drives without a human safety monitor, CEO Elon Musk said on X.Lyft has previously partnered with Mobileye and is working with Tensor Robocar, powered by Nvidia technology, with plans to launch services in 2027. The company will also roll out Waymo rides in Nashville this year. \"Our goal is to be, is to create the best possible trends for riders and, frankly, the lowest cost way for AV tech to be deployed on the platform,\" Risher said of Lyft's strategy. Risher thinks Lyft is in an \"awesome\" position to address future autonomous vehicle demand but said adoption is in the early stage and there are many regulatory and tech hurdles remaining. He said it would be \"quite extraordinary\" if autonomous rides accounted for 10% of Lyft's business by 2030.watch now",

    "body": "The logo for Google LLC is seen at the Google Store Chelsea in Manhattan, New York, Nov. 17, 2021.Andrew Kelly | ReutersMore than 900 Google workers have signed an open letter condemning recent actions by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Customs and Border Protection (CBP), urging the tech giant to disclose its dealings with the agencies and divest from them.The letter, citing recent ICE killings of Keith Porter, Renee Good, and Alex Pretti, said that the employees are \"appalled by the violence\" and \"horrified\" by Google's part in it.\"Google is powering this campaign of surveillance, violence, and repression,\" the letter reads. It goes on to cite that Google Cloud is aiding CBP surveillance and powering Palantir's ImmigrationOS system, which is used by ICE. The letter states that Google's generative artificial intelligence is used by CBP and that the Google Play Store has blocked ICE tracking apps.The letter also quotes a social media post by Google Chief Scientist Jeff Dean from early January, who wrote, \"We all bear a collective responsibility to speak up and not be silent when we see things like the events of the last week.\"\"We are vehemently opposed to Google's partnerships with DHS, CBP, and ICE,\" the employees wrote. \"We consider it our leadership's ethical and policy-bound responsibility to disclose all contracts and collaboration with CBP and ICE, and to divest from these partnerships.\"The letter calls on Google to acknowledge the danger that workers face from ICE, host an emergency internal Q&A on the company's DHS and military contracts, implement safety measures to protect workers — such as flexible work-from-home policies and immigration support — and reveal its ties with the government agencies to help all involved determine where the company will draw a line.\"As workers of conscience, we demand that our leadership end our backslide into contracting for governments enacting violence against civilians,\" the letter reads. \"Google is now a prominent node in a shameful lineage of private companies profiting from violent state repression. We must use this moment to come together as a Googler community and demand an end to this disgraceful use of our labor.\"Google did not immediately respond to a CNBC request for comment.The letter comes as employees place mounting pressure on tech CEOs to speak out against ICE. Just two weeks prior, employees representing Amazon, Spotify, Meta and more wrote a similar letter demanding ICE \"out of our cities.\"",

    "body": "A robotic machine manufactures a semiconductor chip at a stall to show investors during The Advantage Assam 2.0 Investment Summit in Guwahati, India, on Feb. 25, 2025.Nurphoto | Nurphoto | Getty ImagesShares of Chinese interconnect chip designer Montage Technology surged more than 60% in its Hong Kong trading debut on Monday following an initial share sale that raised $902 million.The stock closed at 175 Hong Kong dollars ($22.39) after pricing its offering at HK$106.89, the upper end of the range.Founded in 2004, the Shanghai-based company specializes in supporting infrastructure chips for high-performance computing, data centers and artificial intelligence applications.Its Hong Kong public tranche was subscribed more than 700 times, while the international offering was nearly 38 times covered, signaling strong investor appetite for Chinese AI and semiconductor names.Montage Technology is also listed on the mainland, with a market capitalization of around $27 billion, according to LSEG data.The listing adds to a growing list of Chinese semiconductor firms tapping capital markets in recent months, with GigaDevice Semiconductor and OmniVision Integrated Circuits debuting in January. Other chip firms such as Biren Technology, MetaX, Moore Threads and Shanghai Iluvatar CoreX Semiconductor have also recently listed. The wave of IPOs comes as Beijing ramps up its self-sufficiency efforts in the advanced chip space and reduces reliance on American designers like Nvidia, which are prevented from selling its most advanced chips to China.  However, competition in the market is growing fierce, with Chinese tech giant Huawei and its chip unit HiSilicon holding a leading share of the domestic AI chip market. Meanwhile, Nvidia could be set for a market bounce back after the Trump administration cleared the way for it to sell its H200 chip to China. While the H200 lags Nvidia's most cutting-edge technologies, it is far more powerful than any AI chip previously sold in the Chinese market.China, in late January, had approved a first batch of H200 imports for several domestic tech companies, including ByteDance, Alibaba, Tencent and DeepSeek, according to a report from Reuters. However, the report added that Beijing was only granting approvals under specific conditions, with the final rules still being finalized, according to anonymous sources. ",

Yamil Lage | Afp | Getty ImagesThe Cuban government said international airlines can no longer refuel there due to fuel shortages after U.S. President Donald Trump threatened tariffs on any country that supplies the communist country with oil.The island nation's leadership said Sunday that Cuba will run out of aviation fuel from Monday, likely disrupting airlines operating there, according to EFE news agency, citing two sources. The kerosene shortage is expected to persist for the next month, with all of Cuba's international airports affected.Cuba's Foreign Ministry and the Cuban Embassy in London did not immediately respond to a CNBC request for comment.The Trump administration has sought to tighten the U.S. chokehold on Cuba since Jan. 3, when it conducted an audacious military operation to depose Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, a long-time ally of Cuba's government.Trump, in an executive order issued at the end of January, said the Cuban government constituted \"an unusual and extraordinary threat,\" which required a national emergency declaration. Read moreThe U.S. president said that Cuba's ties to countries including China, Russia and Iran, human rights violations and communist leadership destabilize the region \"through migration and violence.\" As part of the announcement, Trump said U.S. tariffs may target countries that provides any oil to Cuba, whether directly or indirectly. Russia: Fuel situation in Cuba is 'critical'Gripped by a deepening energy crisis, Cuba on Friday outlined extensive measures designed to protect essential services and ration fuel supplies for key sectors.The plan reportedly includes restrictions on fuel sales, the closure of some tourist establishments, shortening school days, and a reduction of the working week in state-owned companies to four days, from Monday to Thursday.Russia, which holds friendly ties with Cuba, said Monday that Havana's fuel situation was \"truly critical\" and that U.S. attempts to further pressure the country were causing numerous problems.\"The situation in Cuba is truly critical. We know this. We are in intensive contact with our Cuban friends through diplomatic and other channels. Indeed, let's say the U.S.'s stranglehold is causing many difficulties for the country,\" Kremlin Spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters on Monday, according to state news outlet RIA Novosti.Pedestrians walk past the Habana Libre Hotel, formerly the Havana Hilton, in Havana on February 2, 2026. Tourism in Cuba suffered a sharp setback in 2025.Yamil Lage | Afp | Getty ImagesCuba's Foreign Minister Bruno Rodríguez Parrilla previously said the country's leadership condemned Washington's tariff threats in the \"strongest possible terms.\"In a statement posted on Jan. 30, Parrilla also accused the U.S. government of resorting to \"blackmail and coercion in an attempt to make other countries to join its universally condemned blockade policy against Cuba.\"Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said last week that her government would aim to send humanitarian aid to Cuba from Monday, adding that the country is working to find a diplomatic solution to resume oil shipments to the Caribbean island.Mexico had paused shipments of crude and refined products to Cuba amid pressure from the Trump administration.",

    "body": "A snow removal machine is seen working while a Boeing 737 American Airlines passenger aircraft is parked at gate on the tarmac of LaGuardia airport in New York on January 25, 2026. Charly Triballeau | Afp | Getty ImagesAmerican Airlines' promised turnaround is off to a rocky start this year.Pilot and flight attendant unions have called CEO Robert Isom's leadership into question as the airline's performance has trailed its rivals by a wide margin, a trend that has translated to lower profit-sharing for American's more than 130,000 employees. Adding to employee frustration, the airline struggled to recover from major winter storms in recent weeks and crews were left stranded — some without a place to sleep beside the airport.Late Friday, the pilots' union wrote to the airline's board, seeking a meeting to discuss the carrier's financial and operational challenges.\"Our airline is on an underperforming path and has failed to define an identity or a strategy to correct course,\" the board of directors of the Allied Pilots Association wrote. The union called for \"leaders who are willing, equipped, and empowered to get the house in order.\"Isom replied on Saturday that as board member and chief executive it is \"most appropriate\" to meet as soon as possible. \"The Board and I are aligned with you in the desire to make American the strongest airline possible in every respect,\" he wrote.American made $111 million last year, an amount eclipsed by profits from Delta Air Lines and United Airlines, which brought in $5 billion and more than $3.3 billion, respectively, even though American flew similar capacity in 2025.\"I know that it is a meager profit-sharing, a very small profit-sharing pool this year. Again, when you break even, that's the kind of profit-sharing you have,\" Isom told employees after releasing earnings results on Jan. 27, according to a recording of the event that was reviewed by CNBC. \"I'm disappointed in that.\"'2026 can't just feel different'American is trying to catch up to rivals with premium products that bring in higher fares, a bright spot in the industry as coach cabin revenue growth has been elusive. It has also worked to reverse the damage from a failed direct-to-traveler business-travel strategy, whose architect American ousted in May 2024. 2026 is crucial for the carrier. The Fort Worth, Texas-based airline issued an upbeat outlook for the year on Jan. 27, and Isom told crews that he was optimistic about improvement this year. He also noted that many staff, like flight attendants, make more than their counterparts at United, where cabin crews and other employees are in contract negotiations.Isom is leading what he has pitched as a major transformation of American. The strategy includes improving customer service, the network and revenue management.This week, he took his message to about 6,000 leaders at a conference the airline held at Globe Life Field in Arlington, Texas.\"We've had conversations as a senior leadership team about how we can't pass up any opportunity ... how we need to hold ourselves accountable,\" Isom said at the event, according to a transcript which was seen by CNBC. \"It starts with us at the top, but it's all of us here today and how you lead your teams. 2026 can't just feel different. It has to be different.\"American issued its 2026 outlook as it was juggling the aftermath of a late January winter storm that walloped much of the U.S. with snow, ice and sleet and preparing for another storm that ended up hitting its major hub of Charlotte, North Carolina, while competitors dug out faster.The financial results, coupled with the slow storm recovery, drew anger from both pilot and flight attendant union leaders, which together represent about 40,000 crew members. This week, two American Airlines flight operations leaders met with the union to discuss recent problems, and the union told members, \"Our pilots will not accept platitudes, empty words, and the absence of decisive action any longer.\" Association of Professional Flight Attendants President Julie Hedrick said on Jan. 27 that Isom, who became CEO in 2022, \"is missing the human factor\" and that \"many of us have been here for a very long time, and we don't see an ending that puts us in a better place.\"Isom acknowledged the trouble American's crew members faced during the late January storm that paralyzed a large swath of the United States and called the weather \"probably the most impactful\" during his decades-long tenure at the airline.Robert Isom, chief executive officer of American Airlines Group Inc., speaks during a Bloomberg Television interview in New York, US, on Wednesday, Dec. 10, 2025. Christian Monterrosa | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesTale of two Texas airlinesAmerican had an especially difficult 2025, which started with the collision of an Army Black Hawk helicopter into one of the carrier's regional jets that was arriving at Washington, D.C.'s Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport, killing all 67 people on both flights. The airline and its rivals were also hit by the U.S. government shutdown late last year.\"We're off to a fast start based on the booking trends we've observed in January, all-time records for the first three weeks of the year,\" Isom told analysts on the Jan. 27 earnings call.But investors also want to the airline to prove its progress.American's stock is roughly flat this year. Its competitor, 20 miles away in Dallas, Southwest Airlines, is also trying to remake itself, and its stock is up more than 30% in 2026. Shares of United and Delta are up more than 3% and more than 8%, respectively, for the year.Southwest's forecast that it could quadruple earnings this year has had investors in a bullish frenzy. That carrier recently sealed the biggest transformation in its nearly 55 years of flying (to some travelers' chagrin): assigning seats for the first time, adding its first-ever bag fees, and rolling out basic economy tickets and other changes. Investors' confidence boosted Southwest's stock to a nearly four-year high last month after it reported results.All U.S. carriers are investing heavily in higher-end travel over standard coach, and even Southwest is considering opening its first airport lounge, its CEO told CNBC last year.American is likewise revamping its wide-body planes with larger, single business-class cabins, putting in a three-class cabin on new Airbus narrow-bodies and expanding its airport lounges. The airline has also refreshed its food and beverage options, including offering Lavazza coffee and Champagne Bollinger. For its 100th anniversary this spring, it's also adding caviar and beef Wellington for long-haul premium cabins.Isom has said he expects half of American's revenue to come from \"premium offerings\" toward the end of the decade. Fight over ChicagoSeveral planes wait in line to taxi down a runway after a winter snow storm affected the area at O'Hare International airport on Nov. 30, 2025 in Chicago, Illinois.Jim Vondruska | Getty ImagesOne major battle for American is at Chicago O'Hare International Airport, where United CEO Scott Kirby, whom American fired in 2016, has vowed to keep his old employer at bay.Both carriers are ramping up their schedules there next summer. Deutsche Bank estimated in a note Monday that United generates about $10 billion in revenue at O'Hare and that American generates more than $5 billion. Around the time American reported earnings, United posted a digital billboard in Chicago that read \"More on time, less canceled flights. Aadvantage, United,\" using the same spelling as American's AAdvantage loyalty program. Bankrupt Spirit Airlines is also seeking to transfer two gates at Chicago O'Hare to United for $30 million, which would give United more ground at the airport.But from Chicago to Charlotte, questions still remain for American.\"It's unclear if the current strategy will close the margin gap to its peers,\" Melius Research airline analyst Conor Cunningham said about American. \"It will take a lot of time to execute. You can't just turn premium revenue on.\"Cunningham added, \"It took Delta over a decade to cultivate a premium image,\" pointing to the U.S. profit leaders' transformation.Read more CNBC airline newsBoeing outsold Airbus last year for first time since 2018, deliveries rise to 600Allegiant to buy rival budget airline Sun Country in $1.5 billion cash and stock dealWhy airline class wars will intensify in 2026American Airlines no longer lets basic economy flyers earn miles",

    "body": "A real estate project under construction along the ancient Huai River in Huai'an City, Jiangsu Province, China on January 29, 2026.Cfoto | Future Publishing | Getty ImagesBEIJING — S&P Global Ratings has lowered its forecast for China property sales this year, barely two months into 2026.The firm said Sunday that primary real estate sales will likely drop by 10% to 14% this year, worse than the 5% to 8% decline for 2026 sales predicted back in October.\"This is a downturn so entrenched that only the government has capacity to absorb the excess inventory,\" the analysts said in a note. They added that the state could buy more unsold property to create affordable housing, but that so far these efforts have been piecemeal.China's property market, once accounting for more than a quarter of the economy, has seen its annual sales volume halve in just four years. Beijing's crackdown on developers' high reliance on debt for growth sparked the initial slump, while consumer demand for homes has yet to pick up.Economists have long warned of overbuilding in China's property market. But developers have only kept up construction despite the sales slump, leading to a sixth-straight year of completed, unsold new housing, according to the ratings agency.\"China's glut of primary housing is keeping a property market recovery out of reach,\" the S&P analysts said, noting the oversupply pressures prices to fall by another 2% to 4% this year, following a similar decline last year.watch now\"Falling prices erode homebuyers' confidence,\" S&P's report said. \"It's a vicious cycle with no easy escape.\"What's particularly concerning, S&P said, is that the price decline in China's biggest cities worsened in the fourth quarter of last year. \"We previously viewed these markets as healthy, and as the likely starting place of any national property recovery,\" the report said.The cities of Beijing, Guangzhou and Shenzhen reported home price declines last year of at least 3%, the report said, noting Shanghai was the only major city to report an increase, up 5.7% in 2025 from 2024.Getting worseChina's property slump progressively worsened throughout 2025.In May, S&P predicted a 3% decline in sales of new homes, only to revise that in October to an 8% drop. Sales ended up falling by 12.6% to 8.4 trillion yuan ($1.21 trillion) — less than half the annual sales of 18.2 trillion yuan seen in 2021.That's ramping up the pressure on China's struggling real-estate developers.If sales end up falling 10 percentage points below S&P's base case for this year and next, four of the 10 Chinese developers that the company rates could see downward rating pressure, the analysts said.That excludes China Vanke, once one of the country's largest developers, which, late last year, asked to delay repayment on some of its debt. \n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tWeekly analysis and insights from Asia's largest economy in your inbox\n\t\t\tSubscribe now\n\t\t\n\tChinese authorities have yet to release significant new support for real estate, preferring to double down on efforts to develop advanced technologies.Last month, U.S.-based research firm Rhodium Group said that China's push into high-tech industries isn't large enough to offset the country's property slump, leaving the economy more reliant on exports for growth and more exposed to trade tensions.Top policymakers are set to release economic goals for the year at a parliamentary meeting next month.",

    "body": "watch nowPresident Donald Trump's official Truth Social account on Friday morning deleted a video showing a racist image of former President Barack Obama and former first lady Michelle Obama portrayed as apes, following widespread bipartisan calls for its removal.The depiction of the Obamas, posted late Thursday from Trump's official Truth Social account, was included in a video clip pushing a conspiracy theory about voting machines during the 2020 election. The post stayed up for about 12 hours.Trump late Friday during a gaggle with reporters accompanying him aboard Air Force One said that he won't apologize for the post. \"I didn't make a mistake,\" he said.Trump told reporters that he didn't watch the whole video, just the beginning.\"I didn't see the whole thing,\" Trump said. \"I looked at the first part, and it was really about voter fraud in the machines, how ‌crooked ‌it is, how disgusting it is. Then I gave it to the people. Generally, they look at ​the whole thing. But I guess somebody didn't.\"When asked if he condemned the video, he replied, \"Of course I do.\"The White House initially defended Trump's post.A screenshot from a video President Donald Trump posted to his social media platform, Truth Social, on Feb. 5, 2026.

A source familiar with the matter, however, later told CNBC that Trump \"had not seen that video before it was posted.\"\"As soon as he found out, he ordered it taken down,\" the source added.Leavitt's initial reply included a link to a longer video posted Oct. 24 from a pro-Trump meme account on X.In addition to showing the Obamas as apes, the full video shows other animals bearing the faces of prominent Democrats, including former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York and Rep.

Mike Lawler, a New York Republican who is considered at risk of losing his seat in the House of Representatives in November's election, also criticized Trump's post.\"The President's post is wrong and incredibly offensive — whether intentional or a mistake — and should be deleted immediately with an apology offered,\" Lawler said on X. The Obama Foundation did not respond to CNBC's request for comment.The video that Trump reposted carried the watermark of an entity calling itself Patriot News Outlet.CNBC reached out to Patriot News Outlet via its email address, requesting comment on the new video, asking who created it and for what purpose, and reaction to the video being removed from Trump's Truth Social feed.In response, the group said, \"We fully unaware of anything that President Trump might have posted including any video claiming to be from Patriot News Outlet. I cannot comment or any your questions for this reason [sic].\"\"Do you have a link to the video or copy of the video you can share?\" the group said.Trump's opponents may seek to make the post an issue for the midterm election in November, though it's still nine months away.

    "body": "For years, bedtime was the most stressful part of my day. No matter how early we started or how carefully I planned, evenings always felt chaotic.I've heard the same story from many of the parents I've worked with, and it's understandable. Bedtime is a major emotional transition that most of us were never taught how to navigate.But as a conscious-parenting researcher who has studied over 200 kids, I've noticed a clear pattern: The happiest, most emotionally well-rounded children have parents who follow a predictable routine that lowers anxiety and strengthens connection. Here's what they do differently.1. They let go of controlMany parents head into bedtime expecting resistance, and children can sense that tension almost immediately.Parents who experience smoother evenings aren't attached to how long the routine takes or how perfectly it unfolds. When you soften your grip on the outcome, your child's nervous system will follow.Remember, if bedtime takes 90 minutes instead of 30, but your child falls asleep feeling safe and calm, that's still a win.2. They connect before they disconnectStalling, clinging, tantrums and irritability at bedtime can be signs of separation anxiety. Parents who understand this slow down the final moments of the evening. They offer physical closeness or quiet presence before saying goodnight. Even 10 to 20 minutes of intentional connection can make a difference. From there, you can set clear but warm boundaries: \"I'm here with you now. After two books and a cuddle, it's time to turn the lights out.\"3. They remove pressure around sleepMany bedtime battles are simply about pressure. When children feel they're expected to \"fall asleep\" on command, their nervous systems shift into alert mode, making rest harder. Parents with the easiest nights stop making sleep the goal. They focus on creating calm conditions. This makes it more likely for our bodies to settle naturally.4. They build a bridge from night into morningTo a child, bedtime can feel like an abrupt ending. You can ease this transition by emphasizing what comes next: \"We'll finish this in the morning,\" or, \"We'll snuggle again when the sun comes up.\"This helps children experience bedtime as a pause, not a loss, reducing anxiety and resistance.Some parents also create this bridge by ending the night with a simple point of connection. They might ask, for example, \"What are you most excited for tomorrow?\" 5. They end the night by reinforcing safetySafety is the signal that tells a child's nervous system it can finally stop bracing and start resting. Without it, even the tiredest body stays alert.You can reinforce safety by saying things like: \"Today was hard. Tonight was hard. And I'm still here.\"\"You didn't have to be perfect today. You just had to be you.\"\"I'm here. You can rest.\" 6. They regulate their own emotionsFinally, and this might be the most important one: Emotionally attuned parents regulate themselves. Evenings are when you are most depleted and therefore most likely to react from stress rather than intention.So pause before engaging. Take a few deep breaths. Ask yourself whether you're carrying stress from the day into the moment. Settle yourself first, then support your child.Reem Raouda is a leading voice in conscious parenting and the creator of the BOUND and FOUNDATIONS journals, now offered together as her Emotional Safety Bundle.

    "body": "A screen displays Nikkei 225 Stock Average inside the Kabuto One building in Tokyo, Japan, on Monday, Feb. 9, 2026. Japanese stocks surged to fresh record highs, while bonds dropped, after Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi's Liberal Democratic Party secured a landslide victory. Photographer: Kiyoshi Ota/Bloomberg via Getty ImagesBloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesA yen nearing 160 to the dollar, record Japanese equities and higher Japanese government bond yields could be on the table after Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi romped to a landslide victory in the country's snap election Sunday. Takaichi led the ruling Liberal Democratic Party to a supermajority in the Lower House, securing 316 seats in the party's largest election victory since World War Two. The result gives her the power to override any legislative veto from the Upper House, strengthening her ability to push her agenda through Japan's legislature. 'Takaichi Trade' returnsAnalysts said that her victory will lead to a revival of the so-called \"Takaichi trade,\" which typically involves a weaker yen, rising equities, and higher long-dated Japanese government bond yields. The trend reflects Takaichi's dovish stance on monetary policy and expectations of expanded fiscal stimulus. Some early signs of these emerged Monday. The benchmark Nikkei 225 soared past the 57,000 mark to a record high, while the broader Topix rose to an all-time peak of 3,825.67, exceeding Citi analysts' pre-election expectations.Stock Chart IconStock chart icon\"The strong LDP win is warming the hearts of investors,\" said Frederic Neumann, Chief Asia Economist at HSBC. \"Equities, in particular, are celebrating the surprising election result, re-loading the 'Takaichi-trade.'\"\"The hope is that the strong majority will give the LDP more leeway in pursuing growth-friendly policies,\" Neumann added. This is echoed by Adrian Wong, global market strategist at J.P. Morgan Asset Management, who said the victory would lead to proactive fiscal measures, such as the two-year consumption tax cut, to increased corporate investment and aggressive corporate reforms.Debt concerns lingerHowever, while most analysts agree on the boost to equities, some warned that heavier spending could pressure bonds and raise bond yields. The yield on the 10-year Japanese government bond rose 4 basis points to 2.27% on Monday. Stock Chart IconStock chart iconBefore the election, Takaichi had announced a record 122 trillion yen budget for the financial year starting April 1, marking a second straight year of record spending. Japan is the most indebted nation in the world, with a debt-to-GDP ratio of almost 230% in 2025, according to data from the International Monetary Fund.Takaichi told national broadcaster NHK after the election that she was pursuing \"a shift in economic and fiscal policy and a 'responsible, proactive fiscal policy.'' \"We will move forward with areas where we can, and will call for cooperation from the opposition parties in areas where we can gain their support,\" she added, according to a Google translation. Carlos Casanova, senior economist for Asia at Swiss private bank UBP, expects the 10-year yield to reach 2.5%, with most of the pressure concentrated at the ultra-long end of the yield curve.watch nowOthers were more cautious. Sree Kochugovindan of Aberdeen Investments said the LDP landslide does not entitle Takaichi \"free rein to just spend.\"\"The LDP is fiscally conservative, and Takaichi has been very mindful of bond investors,\" the senior research economist noted.Japan's debt-to-GDP ratio has declined since the pandemic, he said, and Takaichi's latest fiscal and economic package will keep it on that downward trend.Takaichi said the amount of newly issued government bonds is expected to be 29.6 trillion yen, marking the second consecutive year that issuance remains below 30 trillion yen.Yen headed the opposite wayHowever, in an uncharacteristic move, the yen strengthened 0.4% to trade at 156.55 against the dollar after Takaichi's electoral victory.Michael Wan, senior currency analyst at MUFG, wrote in a note Monday that the move likely reflected continued commitment by Takaichi on fiscal sustainability in her post-election comments, as well as comments from Finance Minister Satsuki Katayama supporting yen stability, in coordination with U.S. authorities.Katayama reportedly said that she would communicate with financial markets on Monday if needed, following Takaichi's win. The yen had approached the 160 mark against the dollar earlier this year, before strengthening sharply in late January amid speculation that the New York Federal Reserve conducted \"rate checks\" on the yen, often seen as a signal of possible intervention. U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent later denied that the U.S. had intervened.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconKatayama early Monday did not rule out taking action against \"rapid movements out of line with fundamentals,\" saying that measures included intervention in the currency market.For analysts, 160 yen to the greenback seems to be the line in the sand, with Citi analysts saying the yen is unlikely to weaken far beyond that level, given awareness of potential forex intervention by Japanese or U.S. authorities.\"The yen will approach the 160 level once more,  but there will likely be a struggle between the market and the authorities near the 159 mark,\" Dutch bank ING said in a Feb. 9 note.

    "body": "watch nowFor years, a growing number of students have been considering alternatives to a four-year degree. Now the trend toward a two-year program or even shorter-term credential — also dubbed \"un-college\" — is gaining steam. Ballooning college costs and the student loan debt that goes along with them are partly to blame. New borrowing limits for 2026 under President Donald Trump's \"big beautiful bill\" are another factor. Plus, students are increasingly seeking job training and career-driven pathways to secure a foothold in today's softening labor market. The term \"un-college\" first emerged about a decade ago to describe the rise of college alternative programs. This year, the shift will be striking, experts say.

Enrollment in private four-year nonprofit institutions fell by 1.6% over the same period.\"Overall enrollment is up slightly, but the real story is the shift between sectors,\" Matthew Holsapple, senior director of research at the National Student Clearinghouse Research Center, said in a statement. \"Community colleges and public universities are gaining ground, while private colleges are down — a clear departure from the broad-based growth of recent years.\" Golden West College students walk to the GWC Student Union in Huntington Beach on Wednesday, Sept. 3, 2025.

To be sure, the job market for new grads is shakier than it's been in years.As the rise of artificial intelligence reshapes the workforce, there are fewer entry-level jobs for those just starting out.

This year, more employers are also focusing on job applicants' skills rather than academic degrees or grade point averages, NACE's Job Outlook 2026 survey found.At the same time, a shortage of skilled tradespeople is boosting the number of job opportunities and pay in industries like nursing, manufacturing and construction, other research shows. Some in-demand trade jobs have average salaries well over $100,000 a year, according to the job site Indeed. How the 'big beautiful bill' may impact higher educationAmid a challenging job market, Trump's \"big beautiful bill,\" which Congress passed last July, will usher in more sweeping changes to higher education. The legislation package establishes, for the first time, a cap on the amount of money that students and their families can borrow from the federal government to pay for college and graduate school. The new limits on federal student loans include a total lifetime borrowing limit of $257,500.Those limits are likely to prompt families to \"increasingly opt for more cost-efficient pathways, such as starting at a two-year college and then transferring to a four-year institution, or choosing in-state public universities over private colleges,\" said Tricia Scarlata, head of education savings at J.P. Morgan Asset Management. \"Now more than ever, weighing the return on investment … is essential, not optional,\" said Derek Brainard, financial director of education nonprofit AccessLex Institute.Further driving interest in \"un-college,\" the \"big beautiful\" law also includes new provisions for short-term Pell Grants. Beginning in mid-2026, students enrolling in workforce training programs at community colleges may be eligible for Pell funding, a need-based aid program for low-income students. \"The creation of Workforce Pell Grants will increase interest in very short programs that are inexpensive and closely tied to jobs,\" higher education expert Mark Kantrowitz said. The grants are worth up to $7,395 for the 2025-26 academic year. Previously, these funds were only available to degree-seeking undergraduate students.\"The smartest move students can make today is to plan with precision: explore scholarships, compare programs and avoid assuming that federal loans will fill every gap,\" Brainard said. \"Students should be running the numbers early — understanding program costs, federal limits and their long‑term borrowing capacity before committing.\"Subscribe to CNBC on YouTube.",

Fabrice Coffrini | AFP | Getty ImagesTwo congressional lawmakers on Sunday called on Howard Lutnick to resign amid revelations that the Commerce secretary had more extensive business and personal dealings with deceased sexual predator Jeffrey Epstein than were previously disclosed.Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., urged Lutnick to step down after The New York Times reported the Trump ally interacted \"regularly\" with Epstein, according to files released by the Department of Justice relating to the notorious sex offender. Massie was the lead Republican on the Epstein Files Transparency Act that compelled the release of the Epstein files.\"He should just resign,\" Massie said on CNN's \"Inside Politics Sunday.\" \"Howard Lutnick clearly went to the island if we believe what's in these files; he was in business with Jeffrey Epstein, and this was many years after Jeffrey Epstein was convicted.\" He added: \"He's got a lot to answer for, but really, he should make life easier on the president, frankly, and just resign.\"Rep. Robert Garcia, D-Calif., the ranking member on the House Oversight Committee, took it a step further, calling on Lutnick to resign — or be fired.\"It's now clear that Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick has been lying about his relationship with Epstein. He said he had no interactions with Epstein after 2005, yet we now know they were in business together,\" he wrote in a post late Sunday on X. \"Lutnick must resign or be fired. And he must answer our questions.\"Massie also noted that several British officials have been toppled over appearances in the Epstein files. Morgan McSweeney, the chief of staff to British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, resigned on Sunday over his role in appointing ousted U.S. ambassador Peter Mandelson. Mandelson was also named in the Epstein files.Lutnick's dealings with Epstein have come under increased scrutiny as dozens of public figures have been named in the files, which the DOJ has been releasing after a law was signed compelling their disclosure. The former chairman and CEO of Cantor Fitzgerald said on the podcast \"Pod Force One\" last year that he swore off interactions with Epstein after an initial encounter in 2005.

The two also had drinks in 2011, the files revealed. The Times report also includes new details, including that Epstein's lawyer obtained the resume of Lutnick's nanny and that Epstein donated $50,000 to an event honoring Lutnick. Epstein and Lutnick also invested in the now-defunct company AdFin Solutions, according to the Times report. A Commerce Department spokesperson told the Times that Lutnick had \"very limited interactions\" with Epstein, and called the report a \"failing attempt by the legacy media to distract from the administration's accomplishments.\"CNBC has reached out to the Commerce Department and the White House for a response.",

    "body": "The International Energy Agency (IEA) 2026 Ministerial Meeting and Energy Innovation Forum in the OCDE in Paris, France, on February 18 and 19, 2026.Nurphoto | Nurphoto | Getty ImagesU.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright said on Thursday that the U.S. would \"pressure\" the International Energy Agency to move away from net zero — and quit from the global watchdog if it failed to do this.Wright was speaking on the last day of an IEA ministerial meeting in Paris and shortly after he said the agency would need to reform for the U.S. to remain a long-term member.\"There has been such a group mentality, 10 years invested in a destructive illusion of net zero by 2050, that the U.S. will use all the pressure we have to get the IEA to eventually, in the next year or so, move away from this agenda,\" Wright said, according to Reuters.The 2015 Paris Agreement committed nations to \"net zero\", the balancing of carbon emitted into the atmosphere and removed from it. The U.S., India and the European Union were among the polluters that ratified the accord.Wright added that it was not Washington's intention to leave the IEA, as there's \"always a risk\" China could gain dominance in the agency if it did. CNBC has reached out to the U.S. Department of Energy and the IEA for comment. A long-running war of wordsThe IEA, which was established in 1974 to ensure the security of oil supplies, faced criticism from the Trump administration last year when it projected that \"peak oil\", when global crude production will reach its highest point before entering an irreversible decline, will take place around 2030.OPEC, the influential group of oil-exporting countries, accused the energy agency of fearmongering and risking the destabilization of the global economy. Wright called the IEA's forecast \"nonsensical.\"The energy watchdog later watered down its forecast, signaling in a major tonal shift that oil demand could keep growing through to the middle of the century.

    "body": "Bill Gates speaks during the Gates Foundation's first global Goalkeepers event in the Nordics, which is being held in Stockholm, Sweden, Jan. 22, 2026. TT News Agency | Stefan Jerrevang | Via ReutersBill Gates has become a source of controversy at this week's high-profile India AI Impact Summit, as speculation around his planned keynote address ultimately ended with his withdrawal at the last minute. The drama comes as the Microsoft co-founder receives public backlash for his past relationship with deceased financier and sex predator Jeffrey Epstein — with more details on the two men's years of communications revealed in the Department of Justice's file drop last month. The Gates Foundation India on Thursday said the billionaire would skip the address \"[a]fter careful consideration, and to ensure the focus remains on the AI Summit's key priorities,\" adding that he would be replaced by another foundation representative. The official announcement capped a back-and-forth saga that began earlier this week when local Indian media pointed out that Gates' name had been removed from some of the summit's public-facing materials. Government sources later briefed the media that Gates was not expected to attend the event. However, the Gates Foundation issued a conflicting message on Wednesday, insisting that he was participating \"as planned\" before the recent reversal. Asked about the controversy on Tuesday, India's IT minister Ashwini Vaishnaw told reporters that Gates' attendance would come down to \"personal choices,\" adding he \"need not comment.\" The summit organizers and the foundation did not immediately respond to a request for comments on Gates' absence.The American tech leader turned philanthropist has been under intense scrutiny in recent weeks following the release of millions of documents related to financier Jeffrey Epstein under the Epstein Files Transparency Act. The files included a draft email written to himself in which Epstein suggests that he had helped facilitate extramarital affairs and sexual encounters for Gates, amongst other references of the Microsoft co-founder. In an interview with Australia's 9News last month, Gates denied any wrongdoing, commenting in relation to new files, calling Epstein's allegations \"absolutely absurd and completely false.\"He emphasized that his interactions with Epstein were limited to dinners aimed at potential philanthropy discussions, adding that he \"never went to the island\" and \"never met any women.\"The New Delhi AI Impact Summit, where Gates had been scheduled to speak, has seen participation from leading tech names such as Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai, OpenAI's Sam Altman, and Anthropic's Dario Amodei, besides a host of global leaders including French President Emmanuel Macron and UN Secretary-General António Guterres.The Gates Foundation has invested in India across health and development, and has also backed projects related to AI.",

Toby Melville | ReutersU.K. police on Thursday arrested King Charles III's brother, Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, on suspicion of misconduct in public office, with the monarch expressing his \"deepest concern\" over the latest development.British police were seen arriving at Andrew's residence in Sandringham, England, on Thursday morning, according to earlier reports from the BBC and the Daily Telegraph.Thames Valley Police said in a statement that they had arrested a man, who they did not name, in his 60s from Norfolk on suspicion of misconduct in public office and are carrying out searches at addresses in Berkshire and Norfolk. \"Following a thorough assessment, we have now opened an investigation into this allegation of misconduct in public office,\" Assistant Chief Constable Oliver Wright said in the police statement.\"It is important that we protect the integrity and objectivity of our investigation as we work with our partners to investigate this alleged offence,\" he said, adding: \"We understand the significant public interest in this case, and we will provide updates at the appropriate time.\" King Charles reactsBuckingham Palace initially declined to comment on the matter but the king issued a statement soon after. \"I have learned with the deepest concern the news about Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor and suspicion of misconduct in public office,\" the king said in a statement sent to CNBC by Buckingham Palace.\"What now follows is the full, fair and proper process by which this issue is investigated in the appropriate manner and by the appropriate authorities,\" he added.The police, Charles said, had the royal family's \"full and wholehearted support and co-operation.\"\"Let me state clearly: the law must take its course.

The former prince continues to deny any wrongdoing. Peter Nicholls | Getty Images Entertainment | Getty ImagesFormer princeAndrew, the younger brother of the king and the second son of the late Queen Elizabeth II, had come under scrutiny due to his relationship with the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, and allegations that he sexually assaulted a high-profile victim of Epstein's sex trafficking, Virginia Giuffre, when she was 17.Andrew denied any wrongdoing in connection with Epstein, and denied ever meeting Giuffre, and there is no indication that his arrest on Thursday is related to Giuffre, who died in 2025.Thames Valley Police has previously said it was \"assessing\" reports alleging that he sent confidential trade reports to Epstein in 2010, when he was Britain's special envoy for international trade. CNBC has contacted Andrew's spokesperson for further comment on the arrest. The public outcry over Andrew's association with disgraced financier Epstein has had far-reaching consequences. The former prince was stripped of his royal titles, including \"His Royal Highness\" and \"Prince,\" and is no longer a working royal.  Andrew was also forced to move out of his Windsor mansion, the Royal Lodge, to a smaller residence on Charles' Sandringham Estate. The king has cut Andrew's annual personal allowance and security funding, but is covering the cost of his new accommodation.A general view of the entrance to Wood Farm, the home of Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor on February 19, 2026 in Sandringham, Norfolk.

    "body": "Nestle shares rose 3% Thursday after the maker of Nescafé and KitKat reported organic sales growth for the fourth quarter that beat analyst forecasts.The closely watched organic sales growth rate came in at 4%, beating a FactSet consensus of 3.55%. For 2026, Nestle said it is targeting organic sales growth of 3% to 4%, along with an improvement in its underlying trading operating profit margin, which stood at 16.1% in 2025.The Vevey, Switzerland-based company also announced it was planning to sell its remaining ice cream business to Haagen-Dazs owner Froneri, a joint venture by PAI and Nestle. In addition, Nestle said it started the formal process to shed its water business earlier in the first quarter, and expects the business, which holds brands such as Henniez and Perrier to be deconsolidated by 2027. Shares were last trading up 2.6% and the stock is up around 2% so far this year.watch nowThe company, under its new leadership duo of CEO Philipp Navratil and Chairman Pablo Isla, a former Inditex executive, have been focusing on streamlining the sprawling consumer giant, after years of operational and share-price underperformance. \"We are accelerating our strategy. We are focusing our portfolio on four businesses, led by our strongest brands, with prioritized resources and a simplified organization,\" Navratil said in a statement.The CEO later told analysts that the remaining ice cream business was \"strong, but small and a distraction\" for the company.Nestle's portfolio plans were \"little changed and undramatic for now,\" analysts at Jefferies said. They noted that there had been some anticipation and uncertainty ahead of the earnings report, but the CEO had left most key ambitions unchanged.UBS wrote in a note that the results reflected early signs of progress while pointing to the strength of confectionery, beverages and petcare as being the biggest drivers of growth in the fourth quarter. An infant formula recall, which has also engulfed rival Danone and privately held Lactalis in France, has provided a stumbling block for restoring trust in the business. Nestle said Thursday its organic growth guidance includes a negative 20 basis point impact from the recall and flagged 1.7 billion Swiss francs in restructuring items, mainly due to the recall. ",

That marked an increase of $17.3 billion from November and was well above the Dow Jones consensus estimate of $55.5 billion.For the full year, the U.S. ran a $901.5 billion deficit, down slightly from 2024 but only by 0.2%, or $2.1 billion. The total was also a bit less than the record $923.7 billion shortfall in 2022.The report follows a year in which President Donald Trump implemented a series of aggressive tariffs aimed at leveling the global playing field. In April, Trump announced an across-the-board duty of 10% on all imports as well as so-called reciprocal tariffs aimed at specific countries that had run up surpluses against the U.S.However, during the course of the year Trump softened many of those positions, and negotiations with major trading partners are ongoing.In an effort to get ahead of the tariffs, companies front-loaded imports during the first three months of the year. The trend abated following the early effort, with October registering the lowest monthly deficit since 2009.The U.S. had its largest goods deficit with the European Union, at $218.8 billion, followed by China, at $202.1 billion, and Mexico, at $196.9 billion.Exports for 2025 totaled $3.43 trillion for all of 2025, up $199.8 billion from 2024.

Over the past five years, we've done exactly that around the globe.\" Jeremy Moeller | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesSince 2020, New Balance has grown sales by a staggering 180%, placing it among a handful of standout competitors that supersized their businesses as Nike changed its business model and lost significant market share.During the Covid-19 pandemic, Nike doubled down on its direct selling strategy that cut off longtime wholesale suppliers so the sneaker giant could grow through its own website and stores. While the strategy briefly boosted sales and promised higher margins, it opened up critical shelf space at strategic retailers that companies like New Balance, Brooks Running, On and Deckers rushed to fill. With so much focus on building out a direct selling model, which can be more complex than distributing to wholesalers, Nike also fell behind on innovation and lost its edge in the performance footwear market. That created further opportunity for competitors like New Balance. Nike's former CEO, John Donahoe, previously blamed remote work during the pandemic for the retailer's innovation slowdown, but Preston said the global crisis created an opportunity for his team to come together in ways they hadn't previously to implement new strategies. \"We met every Tuesday morning at 7:30 a.m., we still have that meeting weekly today, and it allowed us to get on a global offense … we came out of Covid stronger than any other company in our industry,\" said Preston. \"The marketplace disruption that's been taking place, the examples of Nike, sure, all that stuff is real and at the same time, I don't think it's the reason that we have begun to emerge.\" Preston said the company has stood apart from competitors and taken market share by focusing on \"staying in front of the consumer\" and how, when and where people want to shop. The chief executive said New Balance's growth came across a range of regions and categories, and was fueled by an aggressive store-opening plan that saw 80 new doors opened in 2025 alone. While they are a critical revenue driver, store openings are costly and take time to show a return. When asked, New Balance declined to share details about its profitability, so it's unclear how much these investments are weighing on its bottom line, and whether it'll be able to keep up the high growth it has enjoyed.To build up its business after more than 100 years on the market, New Balance took a few cues out of Nike's playbook. The company said a key driver of its growth has been its ability to position itself as a premium brand, which was critical to Nike's ability to become a roughly $50 billion powerhouse.That has meant New Balance being selective with both distribution and discounting. The move has allowed it to increase its average selling price by about 30% over the last five years at a time when many competitors have had to lean on promotions to drive sales.There was also some good timing at play, too. Coming out of the Covid-19 pandemic, New Balance leaned on its heritage as a 1990s \"dad shoe\" when styles from the '90s were extremely popular with younger shoppers. That allowed it to win over a younger consumer base that didn't grow up with the shoes and shoppers who chose sneakers as a fashion statement – not just for sports or working out. At the same time, it partnered with key athletes, including Los Angeles Dodgers two-way superstar Shohei Ohtani, tennis star Coco Gauff and Buffalo Bills quarterback Josh Allen, which has fueled growth in its performance footwear business. For the year ahead, New Balance said it plans to grow its existing product lines, build out new products and put a bigger emphasis on performance sales. It also wants to continue growing its direct-to-consumer sales through store openings in strategic areas. While the direct selling strategy didn't go so well for Nike, Preston said he's taking a different approach. \"One of the things we're not doing is establishing a [DTC] target internally,\" said Preston. \"We want to make sure that our goal is to show up the best and not have it be the biggest part of our business. I don't want to get in the way with how the consumer wants to shop. We want to make sure that we are enabling the consumer to shop how they want to shop. We just want to show up great.\" ",

    "body": "watch nowWest Virginia's attorney general has filed a consumer protection lawsuit against Apple, alleging that it has failed to prevent child sexual abuse materials from being stored and shared via iOS devices and iCloud services.John \"JB\" McCuskey, a Republican, accused Apple of prioritizing privacy branding and its own business interests over child safety, while other big tech companies, including Google, Microsoft, and Dropbox, have been more proactive, using systems like PhotoDNA to combat such material.PhotoDNA, developed by Microsoft and Dartmouth College in 2009, uses \"hashing and matching\" to automatically identify and block child sexual abuse material (CSAM) images when they have already been identified as such and reported to authorities.In 2021, Apple had tested its own CSAM-detection features that could automatically find and remove images of child exploitation, and report those that had been uploaded to iCloud in the U.S. to the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children.But the company withdrew its plans for the features after privacy advocates who worried that this technology could create a back door for government surveillance, and be tweaked and exploited to censor other kinds of content on iOS devices.The company's efforts since then have not satisfied a broad array of critics.Read more CNBC tech newsAmid Epstein fallout, Bill Gates becomes point of controversy at India AI summitOpenAI and Anthropic's rivalry on display as CEOs avoid holding hands at AI summitChinese tech companies progress 'remarkable,' OpenAI's Altman tells CNBCAnthropic is clashing with the Pentagon over AI use. Here's what each side wantsIn 2024, UK-based watchdog the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children said Apple failed to adequately monitor, tabulate and report CSAM in its products to authorities. And in a 2024 lawsuit filed in California's Northern District, thousands of child sexual abuse survivors sued Apple, alleging the company never should have abandoned its earlier plans for CSAM detection features, and by allowing such material to proliferate online, it had caused survivors to relive their trauma.Apple has positioned itself as the most privacy-sensitive of the Big Tech companies, since its CEO Tim Cook wrote an open letter on the topic in 2014. If West Virginia's suit is successful, it could force the company to make design or data security changes. The state is seeking statutory and punitive damages, and injunctive relief requiring Apple to implement effective CSAM detection.In an e-mailed statement, a spokesperson for Apple told CNBC that \"protecting the safety and privacy of our users, especially children, is central to what we do.\"The company pointed to parental controls and features like Communication Safety which, \"automatically intervenes on kids' devices when nudity is detected in Messages, shared Photos, AirDrop and even live FaceTime calls,\" as an indication of its commitment to provide \"safety, security, and privacy\" to users.\"We are innovating every day to combat ever-evolving threats and maintain the safest, most trusted platform for kids,\" the spokesperson added.-- CNBC's Kif Leswing contributed reportingwatch now",

Elizabeth Frantz | ReutersThe Trump administration has warned it would be \"very wise\" for Iran to make a deal, amid reports the White House is considering fresh military action against Tehran as soon as this weekend. It comes shortly after Vice President JD Vance accused Iran of failing to address core U.S. demands during nuclear talks in Switzerland this week. Iran's foreign minister previously reported progress in the talks, saying the two countries had reached an understanding over the \"guiding principles\" for the negotiations.Speaking at a news briefing Wednesday, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said there were \"many reasons and arguments that once could make for a strike against Iran,\" noting that the two countries remain \"very far apart\" on some issues.The U.S. president had a \"very successful\" operation last June, Leavitt said, when U.S. stealth bombers struck three Iranian nuclear facilities as part of \"Operation Midnight Hammer.\"watch now\"The president has always been very clear though with respect to Iran or any country around the world, diplomacy is always his first option. And Iran would be very wise to make a deal with President Trump and this administration,\" Leavitt said. The White House has said it still hopes to reach a diplomatic resolution over Tehran's nuclear program, although U.S. media has reported that the military could be prepared to strike Iran as early as the weekend. 'Extremely dangerous' situationBoth the U.S. and Iran have increased military activity in the oil-producing Middle East region in recent weeks.The U.S., for its part, has built up a significant presence of air and naval assets, while Iran has conducted military drills in the strategically vital Strait of Hormuz and announced joint naval drills with Russia in the Sea of Oman.Laura James, Middle East senior analyst at Oxford Analytica, described the current situation as \"extremely dangerous,\" with the U.S. and Iran \"certainly closer\" to an outright conflict than last week.watch now\"The thing that is now a particular concern over the past 24 hours is the very rapid pace at which the United States is reinforcing its air power in the region. That, of course, can still be signalling and pressure for a particular diplomatic outcome,\" James told CNBC's \"Access Middle East\" on Thursday.\"But as more and more planes comes in and more and more equipment comes in, that signalling gets more and more expensive. And therefore, the payoff you want for it in diplomatic terms has to be larger — and there is simply no sign Tehran can offer the absolute minimum that Washington is likely to demand,\" she added.

The online marketplace also reported mixed earnings results for the fourth quarter. Here's how Etsy did, compared with estimates from analysts polled by LSEG: Earnings per share: 92 cents vs. 84 cents estimatedRevenue: $882 million vs. $885 million estimatedGross merchandise sales, or the dollar value of items sold, slid 3.8% year over year to $3.59 billion and missed analyst estimates of $3.6 billion, according to FactSet. The company attributed the annual decline to its sale of musical instrument marketplace Reverb, which was completed last June. The downbeat results were overshadowed by the Depop deal announced on Wednesday. Etsy CEO Kruti Patel Goyal said in a statement that the sale would allow the company to \"focus exclusively\" on its core marketplace.

The second trial regarding former President Yoon Suk-yeol's charge of leading a rebellion hold at the Seoul Central District Court. (Photo by Jung Yeon-Je - Pool/Getty Images)Pool | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesFormer South Korean president Yoon Suk Yeol was sentenced to life imprisonment Thursday after being found guilty of leading an insurrection during his declaration of martial law in December 2024. The ruling, delivered by Seoul Central District Court Judge Jee Kui-youn, was lighter than the death penalty prosecutors sought at the trial's final hearing in January. The ruling was aired live on South Korea's major broadcasters.Jee said in the verdict that Yoon led an insurrection and committed acts to subvert the country's constitutional order.The court added that Yoon \"took the lead in planning the crime and involved a large number of people,\" and that it was \"difficult to see any sign of remorse from the defendant, who also refused to appear in court.\"Yoon had previously reportedly refused to appear in court for questioning last year. The court also found Yoon had ordered South Korea's military to capture individuals during the martial law declaration, including the current president Lee Jae Myung. Yoon also had the intention to \"paralyze\" the country's parliament by deploying troops to blockade the National Assembly and arrest key politicians, Jee said.Five others were also sentenced, including former defense minister Kim Yong-hyun, who was sentenced to 30 years in prison.The defendants may appeal the ruling within a week. The sentence follows a separate ruling on Jan. 16, when Yoon was given a five-year prison term for attempting to obstruct his arrest after he was impeached and suspended from office. Other senior officials have been sentenced over the failed martial law bid. Former Prime Minister Han Duck-soo was sentenced to 23 years in prison, while former Interior Minister Lee Sang-min received a seven-year sentence.Yoon was the first sitting South Korean president to be arrested in an operation involving over 3,000 police personnel that involved a standoff with presidential security agents. Martial law attemptDuring the final hearing, special counsel Cho Eun-suk's team said Yoon declared martial law \"with the purpose of remaining in power for a long time by seizing the judiciary and legislature,\" according to South Korean media reports.Yoon reportedly maintained his innocence, arguing the declaration was within his constitutional authority and was intended to \"safeguard freedom and sovereignty.\"He imposed South Korea's first instance of martial law in 44 years during a late-night address on Dec. 3, claiming that the then-opposition Democratic Party of Korea was engaging in \"anti-state activities\" and colluding with \"North Korean communists.\"Troops were deployed to the country's National Assembly, while soldiers and police clashed with protesters outside the compound. Television footage showed special forces breaking windows to gain access to the chamber, while parliamentary staffers used furniture to barricade doors.Then-defense minister Kim Yong-hyun also reportedly ordered troops to \"pull people inside the National Assembly building outside.\"But the martial law order was overturned within three hours, after 190 of the 300 National Assembly lawmakers gathered in the chamber and unanimously voted to do so. Yoon eventually lifted martial law about six hours after announcing it.He was impeached 11 days later and removed from office on April 4, 2025. ",

    "body": "Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat from Massachusetts and ranking member of Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee, speaks during a hearing in Washington, Feb. 5, 2026.Kent Nishimura | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesSen. Elizabeth Warren asked the Treasury Department and the Federal Reserve on Wednesday to confirm that they will not \"use taxpayer dollars to bail out cryptocurrency billionaires and other highly leveraged cryptocurrency investors.\"The Massachusetts Democrat's request to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Fed Chair Jerome Powell came as bitcoin continued a slide that has seen the popular cryptocurrency drop about 50% since hitting a high in October.Warren, in a letter to Bessent and Powell about a potential bailout, warned that it not only \"would be deeply unpopular to transfer wealth from American taxpayers to cryptocurrency billionaires, it could also directly enrich President [Donald] Trump and his family's cryptocurrency company, World Liberty Financial.\"She noted that both the Treasury Department and the Fed have authorities that empower them to give financial support to banks and other entities during a financial crisis.\"Concerningly, at a recent hearing, in an exchange regarding his authority to bail out the cryptocurrency industry, Secretary Bessent was asked whether 'the money of our taxpayers … is … going to be deployed into crypto assets,'\" Warren wrote, referring to the secretary's testimony on Feb. 6 to the House Financial Services Committee.\"Rather than giving a simple 'no,' he deflected, stating that '[w]e are retaining seized bitcoin,'\" Warren wrote. \"It's deeply unclear what, if any, plans the U.S. government currently has to intervene in the current Bitcoin selloff.\"Read more CNBC politics coverageBillionaire Les Wexner's congressional deposition over Jeffrey Epstein ties is underwayTrump administration sued for Stonewall Pride flag removal in New YorkPotomac River sewage spill: Trump says Democrats need to ask for his helpStephen Colbert says CBS blocked James Talarico interview from air\"Ultimately, any government intervention to stabilize Bitcoin would disproportionately benefit crypto billionaires,\" wrote Warren, who is the ranking Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee. \"Your agencies must refrain from propping up Bitcoin and transferring wealth from taxpayers to crypto billionaires through direct purchases, guarantees, or liquidity facilities.\"The Treasury Department and Fed did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Warren's letter.The letter came on the same day that World Liberty Financial hosted its first World Liberty Forum for business leaders at Trump's Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Florida.In the letter, Warren said the sell-off in bitcoin \"has been amplified by cascading liquidations of leveraged positions.\"She wrote that Trump's crypto company World Liberty Financial \"has sold around 173 wrapped Bitcoin.\"\"This transaction was made to repay $11.75 million in USDC stablecoin debt, thereby avoiding liquidation as Bitcoin's price dropped below $63,000,\" she wrote.\"During this selloff, crypto billionaires have taken massive hits, as Bitcoin's value continues to plummet. Crypto billionaire Michael Saylor's Strategy Inc., one of the largest corporate holders of Bitcoin, has reportedly seen its shares fall nearly 20% since the beginning of the year,\" Warren wrote.\"Other major Bitcoin investors have also seen losses, including Binance founder Changpeng Zhao, who reportedly lost nearly $30 billion, and Coinbase's Brian Armstrong, who reportedly lost $7 billion.\"Elsewhere in the letter, Warren said that federal financial agencies \"must strengthen protections for retail crypto investors.\"She noted that in 2025, a record $17 billion was lost or stolen in crypto fraud.Correction: This story has been revised to reflect that bitcoin has lost about half its value since its October high. A previous version mischaracterized the extent of its drop in value.",

Bridget Bennett | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesAccenture has told senior staff they must regularly use its AI tools to be considered for promotions for leadership roles.Associate directors and senior managers at the consultancy giant were informed that \"regular adoption\" of AI would be required to progress to leadership positions, according to an FT report. An Accenture spokesperson told CNBC the report was correct. They added: \"Our strategy is to be the reinvention partner of choice for our clients and to be the most client-focused, AI-enabled, great place to work. \"That requires the adoption of the latest tools and technologies to serve our clients most effectively.\"The spokesperson also confirmed that, as the FT reported, the policy had been set out in an internal email. \"Use of our key tools will be a visible input to talent discussions,\" the email said, according to the FT. The FT reported that Accenture staff in 12 European countries were unaffected by the policy, as well as staff working in the division that handles U.S. government contracts. watch nowIn September, Accenture outlined a restructuring strategy in which it said staff who are unable to reskill on AI would eventually be laid off.On an earnings call, CEO Julie Sweet said all employees would be expected to \"retrain and retool\" at scale, adding that 550,000 workers had already been reskilled on the fundamentals of generative AI. Accenture employs a total of 780,000 people globally.\"Our No. 1 strategy is upskilling, given the skills we need, and we've had a lot of experience in upskilling, we're trying to, in a very compressed timeline, where we don't have a viable path for skilling, sort of exiting people so we can get more of the skills in we need,\" Sweet added.Sweet told CNBC at the time: \"Our early investment in AI is really paying off.\"\"Every CEO, board and the C-suite recognize that advanced AI is critical to the future. The challenge right now they're facing is that they're really excited about the technology and they're not yet AI ready for most companies,\" she told CNBC's \"Squawk on the Street.\"Accenture announced a string of partnerships and tools in recent months. Accenture partnered with OpenAI in December to give tens of thousands of its employees access to ChatGPT Enterprise and continue to upskill on AI. Accenture also partnered with Anthropic to train 30,000 employees on Claude AI tools, with tens of thousands of Accenture developers to use Claude Code for coding and AI-assisted work.Other ventures include partnering with Palantir so that over 2,000 Accenture staff can get AI training using the software company's platforms.",

    "body": "Shares in Blue Owl Capital tumbled 8.7% on Thursday after the private market and alternative assets manager sold $1.4 billion of loan assets held across three of its private debt funds.Blue Owl said Wednesday it had agreed the sale with four North American pension and insurance investors, with the loans changing hands at 99.7% of par value.The largest sale comes out of the Blue Owl Capital Corporation II fund, also known as OBDC II, a semi-liquid private credit strategy aimed at U.S. retail investors. OBDC II offloaded $600 million in loans, amounting to about 34% of its $1.7 billion portfolio.In a major switch, Blue Owl said that following the deal, OBDC II would end regular quarterly liquidity payments to the fund's investors.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconBlue Owl.Instead, the business development company — which specializes in private credit lending to U.S. middle-market companies — will pivot to periodic payouts that will be funded by asset sales, earnings, repayments and other strategic deals.That shift more tightly restricts investor liquidity and their ability to withdraw their money. The move underlines the challenges surrounding liquidity and transparency in private markets, amid the ongoing push by private asset managers and alternative investment funds into the more liquid retail wealth space.It follows a recent rise in redemption requests in some of Blue Owl's business development companies, according to a Bloomberg report.Last November, Blue Owl Capital attempted to merge OBDC II with the larger, publicly-traded Blue Owl Capital Corporation (OBDC) fund. Before abandoning its plans, Blue Owl halted redemptions in OBDC II until the deal — which could have brought losses of some 20% to investors — was completed. The episode rattled investors, sending Blue Owl Capital's shares lower.Now, Blue Owl will use the proceeds from this sale to pay down debt and return capital to OBDC II shareholders, at up to $2.35 per share or approximately 30% of OBDC II's net asset value.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconBlue Owl Capital Corporation (OBDC).Elsewhere, the other funds — the OBDC and Blue Owl Technology Income Corp (OTIC) — each sold $400 million in assets, representing 2% and 6% of their respective portfolios.\"These sales consist of 97% senior secured debt investments with an average size of $5 million and include investments in 128 distinct portfolio companies across 27 industries,\" Blue Owl said in a statement.\"The largest industry represented is internet software and services at 13%, generally consistent with the industry composition of Blue Owl's overall direct lending strategy and reflecting continued confidence in the quality and valuations of these software investments.\"Logan Nicholson, president of OBDC II and OBDC, said the deal \"opportunistically\" delivers value to shareholders and, in OBDC II, provides a \"significant liquidity event\" while maintaining a diversified portfolio with strong earnings potential.",

Eduardo Munoz Alvarez | Getty ImagesA desire for deep discounts inspired 202.9 million U.S. consumers to shop during the five-day stretch from Thanksgiving Day through Cyber Monday, according to a survey by the National Retail Federation and Prosper Insights & Analytics released on Tuesday.That estimated total surpassed the major trade group's forecast that 186.9 million people would shop during the five-day period. It also increased from last year's turnout of 197 million shoppers during the same period. The shopping turnout is the largest since NRF began tracking the five-day total in 2017, and topped the previous high of 200.4 million shoppers during the same days in 2023. The trade group does not estimate the total amount spent during the extended Thanksgiving weekend.On a call with reporters, NRF CEO Matt Shay described the shopping period as \"the psychological kickoff of the holidays.\" He said the number of shoppers represented \"a very, very solid beginning\" to the season.\"One of the key drivers here is that for many Americans and many families, holiday spending and holiday shopping is an essential part of the budget,\" he said. Even when consumers are pulling back and making trade-offs, they may still shop as December approaches. Shay said the holidays are \"very much an emotional purchase.\" Retailers and economists are closely watching spending during the peak shopping season while trying to make sense of conflicting indicators about the country and U.S. households' outlook. While consumer sentiment has tumbled and a growing number of major companies have laid off thousands of employees, retail sales data remains solid. Even during a time of year that typically brings higher store traffic, retailers have looked for ways to manage one of their top costs: labor. Holiday hiring by retailers is expected to total between 265,000 and 365,000 roles this year, the lowest number of seasonal workers in at least 15 years, according to the NRF.Despite that, the NRF anticipates U.S. consumers will still spend freely on gifts, decor and more. The trade group said in early November that it expects holiday spending to hit a record of between $1.1 trillion and $1.2 trillion from Nov. 1 through Dec. 31, the first time the total would top $1 trillion.That would represent a 3.7% to 4.2% increase from the year-ago holiday period. It would be a slight drop from last year's 4.3% holiday sales growth rate. NRF's forecast excludes auto dealers, gas stations and restaurants.Shay said the Thanksgiving weekend spending gives the industry group confidence it's on track to hit that projection. At the end of Cyber Monday, shoppers told NRF that they had about 53% of their holiday shopping remaining, which is similar to a year ago.

Michael Nagle | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesConsumers said in the survey that they were motivated to make purchases during the five days because of sales and promotions, such as free shipping and limited-time deals, said Phil Rist, executive vice president at Prosper Insights & Analytics, the research firm that conducts NRF's annual survey. The poll included nearly 3,100 adults and was conducted from Nov. 26 to Nov. 30.Mark Mathews, chief economist for the NRF, said \"there's a moat around this type of spending\" for families across income levels. He said financially stretched households typically cut back in other areas like recreation and travel as they prioritize spending on the holidays. He added that he expects shoppers to fill up bigger shopping baskets this season, including items that aren't for the holidays, because shoppers \"want to take advantage of these great deals that they're seeing.\"Top gifts bought during the five-day span were clothing and accessories, with 51% of consumers surveyed saying they purchased items in the category, followed by toys with 32%, books and other media with 28%. and gift cards with 26%.A total of 129.5 million consumers shopped in stores over the five days, a 3% year-over-year increase, the survey found, even as the more Americans have done more of their Black Friday shopping online in recent years. The online shopping turnout jumped even more — by 9% year over year  — as 134.9 million people shopped on retailers' websites and apps.Other research indicated a step-up in online spending, too. U.S. consumers spent a total of $14.25 billion online on Cyber Monday, a 7.1% year-over-year increase, according to Adobe Analytics. The company analyzes direct transactions online and covers over 1 trillion visits to U.S. retail sites, 100 million individual items and 18 product categories.  During the five-day stretch from Thanksgiving through Cyber Monday, Adobe said consumers spent $44.2 billion online overall — a 7.7% year-over-year jump. A significant chunk of that came from online spending on Black Friday, which totaled $11.8 billion and grew by 9.1% year over year as shoppers sought out early deals. ",

Kevin Mazur | Getty ImagesPop star Sabrina Carpenter on Tuesday blasted the Trump administration for using her hit 2024 song \"Juno\" as the soundtrack for a TikTok video showing Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents detaining people during raids.\"This video is evil and disgusting,\" Carpenter wrote on X, in response to the White House posting the ICE video on TikTok.\"Do not ever involve me or my music to benefit your inhumane agenda,\" she added.The clip posted by the White House begins with footage of a protest against ICE operations before cutting to a montage of agents handcuffing and detaining people. The soundtrack features a viral lyric from \"Juno\": \"Have you ever tried this one?\" The caption on the White House's post echoes the lyric: \"Have you ever tried this one? Bye-bye.\"Carpenter typically performs the song on tour with a playful skit involving pink furry faux handcuffs.White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson responded to Carpenter's criticism in a statement to CNBC.\"Here's a Short n' Sweet message for Sabrina Carpenter: we won't apologize for deporting  dangerous criminal illegal murderers, rapists, and pedophiles from our country,\" Jackson said.\"Anyone who would defend these sick monsters must be stupid, or is it slow?\" she said.\"Short n' Sweet\" is the 2024 album by Carpenter that launched her to global fame. \"Juno\" is on that album.CNBC has requested comment from Carpenter representatives.Carpenter is the latest in a growing line of artists who have objected to President Donald Trump or his administration using their music without permission or in political messaging. Beyoncé, Neil Young, ABBA, Celine Dion, and Olivia Rodrigo are among the performers who have previously demanded that Trump stop using their songs at rallies or in social-media videos. Several of those artists have sent cease-and-desist letters or threatened legal action.",

    "body": "John Giannandrea.David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesApple's AI chief is stepping down, the company announced Monday in the most visible shake up yet to the iPhone maker's artificial intelligence group since launching its Apple Intelligence suite in 2024.John Giannandrea, who held the position since joining the company in 2018, will be replaced by Amar Subramanya, an AI researcher who most recently worked for Microsoft and was previously part of Google's DeepMind AI unit, according to his LinkedIn profile. Giannandrea was a senior vice president and reported to Apple CEO Tim Cook. He will continue to serve as an advisor until retiring next spring, Apple said.The change comes as experts this year have said Apple has fallen behind its tech peers in artificial intelligence, a tech field that has been reinvigorated since OpenAI launched ChatGPT in 2022.Apple Intelligence, which was intended to put Apple alongside AI leaders like OpenAI and Google, has not been well-reviewed by users and critics. Earlier this year, one of its most critical aspects, a significantly improved Siri assistant, was delayed until 2026, signaling development challenges. Subramanya will serve as Apple's vice president of AI, and will report to software chief Craig Federighi, the company said.In a statement, Cook said Federighi has already been playing a key role in Apple's AI efforts.\"In addition to growing his leadership team and AI responsibilities with Amar's joining, Craig has been instrumental in driving our AI efforts, including overseeing our work to bring a more personalized Siri to users next year,\" Cook said in a statement. Subramanya will lead teams working on Apple's foundation models, research and AI safety. Other teams previously under Giannandrea will move under COO Sabih Khan and services chief Eddy Cue, Apple said.Although Apple shares are up 16% in 2025, they have lagged many other big tech companies as investors say the iPhone maker has fallen behind its peers that are investing billions into AI data centers, chips and frontier models.Apple said in August that it was \"significantly increasing\" the amount it spends on AI, and Cook has said it's a \"profound\" technology. Apple has struck a deal with leader OpenAI to integrate ChatGPT into some of its products, like Siri.But Apple is playing a different game than companies like Microsoft, Google, and Meta. It's spending much less on infrastructure for the technology. Apple also prefers its AI to run on its devices, instead of communicating back to more powerful computers in the cloud.Apple this year also saw Jony Ive, its legendary hardware designer who helped late co-founder Steve Jobs invent the iPhone, sell his startup io for $6.4 billion to OpenAI, with the intention of helping the AI lab release its own hardware.Analysts say that Apple has built a loyalty moat among its customers since the iPhone launched in 2007, but AI-driven hardware is on its way, with Ive and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman last month saying that they've already completed their first prototypes and could reveal them in two years or less.WATCH: Apple will gain more AI functionality over time, says D.A.

He posted a chart with subscribers that he said \"shows the kind of present value destruction that this level of dilution can impart.\"He said the vote to accept CEO Elon Musk's $1 trillion compensation plan means investors should expect to get diluted further — meaning that that these additional shares water down their ownership of the company. The package had 75% approval among voting shares, despite proxy advisors Glass Lewis and ISS coming out against it.\"With recent news of Elon Musk's $1 trillion dollar pay package, dilution is certain to continue,\" Burry wrote.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconTesla in 2025Tesla's market cap is currently $1.43 trillion. The electric vehicle maker's shares have added more than 6% so far in 2025, while the S&P 500 has surged more than 15% in the same period.Burry noted that moving past dilution \"is not easy\" for businesses. He also pointed to Palantir and Amazon as other well-known technology companies that dilute their shares through employee-based compensation, a practice that Burry said \"penalizes shareholders.\"The newsletter post goes into an in-depth explanation of how stock-based compensation is not accurately reflected under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) and how companies used \"adjusted\" earnings to present a bottom line that wrongly ignores the practice as a real expense.Burry quotes Warren Buffett's view of stock-based compensation being treated as something other than a tangible expense: \"What else could it be — a gift from shareholders?\" wrote Buffett in his Berkshire Hathaway 2018 annual letter.Burry launched his Substack called \"Cassandra Unchained\" late last month after deregistering hedge fund Scion Asset Management. The blog, which has a $379 annual subscription fee, has so far focused on why he believes artificial intelligence is a bubble.",

Trump last month appeared to soften his stance on H1-B visas, saying in an interview to Fox News that foreign labor was needed at times because U.S. did not have \"certain talents.\" \"I'm certainly not in the school of thought that we should shut down the H-1B program,\" Musk said, adding that it would be \"very bad.\" watch nowMusk, whose relationship with the U.S. president appears to be on the mend having soured in May over Trump's spending bill, also raised concerns over the U.S. administration's tariff policy.

If tariffs at an individual level, or within each state of U.S. would be disastrous for the economy, \"then why do you want tariffs between countries?\" he said.The Tesla CEO, who spearheaded the formation of the Department of Government Efficiency that was recently disbanded with eight months left to its mandate, according to Reuters, said \"the president has made it clear he loves tariffs.\"Trump has levied \"reciprocal\" tariffs on dozens of countries, with several managing to strike a deal with the U.S. to lower levies.In the podcast with Kamath covering a wide range of topics, Musk also laid out his vision for the future, forecasting that working will be optional in less than 20 years and money as a concept would \"disappear.\"Energy is the true currency, Musk said. \"This is why I said bitcoin is based on energy. You can't legislate energy.\" Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have seen a sharp sell-off over the past two months as investor mood sours on digital assets.",

Speaking via teleconference, Son and OpenAI chief Sam Altman argued that advancing artificial intelligence would lead to new jobs that are not yet imagined, and the advancement of robotics will help kickstart a \"self-improvement\" loop. Photographer: Kiyoshi Ota/Bloomberg via Getty ImagesBloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesSoftBank Group founder Masayoshi Son on Monday downplayed the decision to offload the conglomerate's entire Nvidia stake, saying he \"was crying\" over parting with the shares. Speaking at a forum in Tokyo Monday, Son addressed SoftBank's November disclosure that the firm had sold its holding in the American chip darling for $5.83 billion. According to Son, SoftBank wouldn't have made the move if it didn't need to bankroll its next artificial intelligence investments, including a big bet on OpenAI and data center projects. \"I don't want to sell a single share. I just had more need for money to invest in OpenAI and other projects, Son said during the FII Priority Asia forum. \"I was crying to sell Nvidia shares.\"Son's comments are consistent with what analysts and other Softbank executives said in November, describing the sale as part of broader efforts to bolster SoftBank Vision Fund's AI war chest. SoftBank has doubled down on its AI plans this year with a series of projects, including work on Stargate Project data centers and the acquisition of U.S. chip designer Ampere Computing.The Japanese giant could also \"potentially\" increase its investment in OpenAI depending on the performance of the ChatGPT maker and the valuation of further rounds, a person familiar with the matter previously told CNBC.Earlier this year, Son said that SoftBank was \"all in\" on OpenAI and predicted the AI startup would one day become the most valuable company in the world. So far, that bet has reaped some dividends, with SoftBank reporting last month that its second-quarter net profit more than doubled to 2.5 trillion yen ($16.6 billion), driven by valuation gains in its OpenAI holdings.However, SoftBank's massive AI bets come amid growing fears and jitters in markets about a potential AI bubble. In his Monday talk, Son also pushed back against these concerns, arguing that those who talk about an AI bubble are \"not smart enough.\"He predicted that \"super [artificial] intelligence\" and AI robots will generate at least 10% of global gross domestic product over the long term, which he said would outweigh trillions of dollars of investment into the technology.",

Giuseppe Cacace | Afp | Getty ImagesBoeing is continuing to express optimism about its business as the company wraps up the year and looks at 2026.Chief Financial Officer Jay Malave said Tuesday at a UBS conference that the company expects deliveries of both its 737 and 787 jets to be up next year.\"When you now fast forward to 2026, we're going to be increasing our deliveries,\" Malave said. Boeing's stock rose more than 10% in afternoon trading Tuesday after Malave's comments.He added that he expects the certification for the 737-10 aircraft, which is years behind schedule, to come later in 2026. The bolstered deliveries will be \"a big driver\" of cash flow as well, Malave said, with positive free cash flow expected to be in the billions in the \"low single digits.\" Boeing hasn't turned an annual profit since 2018.Malave also said the company expects that cash margins will get a \"pretty significant boost\" through 2030 due to the higher productivity.Boeing has been experiencing an upward trend after a period of increased scrutiny following the blowout of a door plug on a flight in January 2024. In July, CEO Kelly Ortberg said the company was beginning to see changes in its business, including slashing its quarterly losses. Boeing saw a strong delivery pace in October, putting it on track for its highest annual delivery total since 2018. The company said its jetliner deliveries drove it back into cash-positive territory for the first time in nearly two years in October. Those deliveries follow a lifting of restrictions by the Federal Aviation Administration, allowing the company to sign off on some of its 737 Max and 787 Dreamliner planes before they reach customers.",

    "body": "Elon Musk, chief executive officer of Tesla Inc., during the US-Saudi Investment Forum at the Kennedy Center in Washington, DC, US, on Wednesday, Nov. 19, 2025.Bloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesElon Musk has again sounded the alarm on the dangers of AI and listed what he considers as the three most important ingredients to ensure a positive future with the technology. The billionaire CEO of Tesla, SpaceX, xAI, X and The Boring Company, appeared on a podcast with Indian billionaire Nikhil Kamath on Sunday.\"It's not that we're guaranteed to have a positive future with AI,\" Musk said on the podcast. \"There's some danger when you create a powerful technology, that a powerful technology can be potentially destructive.\" Musk was a co-founder of OpenAI alongside Sam Altman, but left its board in 2018 and publicly criticized the company for ditching its founding mission as a non-profit to develop AI safely after it launched ChatGPT in 2022. Musk's xAI developed its own chatbot, Grok, in 2023. Musk has previously warned that \"one of the biggest risks to the future of civilization is AI,\" and stressed that rapid advancements are leading AI to become a bigger risk to society than cars or planes or medicines.On the podcast, the tech billionaire emphasized the importance of ensuring AI technologies pursue truth instead of repeating inaccuracies. \"That can be very dangerous,\" Musk told Kamath, who is also the co-founder of retail stockbroker Zerodha.\"Truth and beauty and curiosity. I think those are the three most important things for AI,\" he said. He said that, without strictly adhering to truths, AI will learn information from online sources where it \"will absorb a lot of lies and then have trouble reasoning because these lies are incompatible with reality.\" He added: \"You can make an AI go insane if you force it to believe things that aren't true because it will lead to conclusions that are also bad.\"\"Hallucination\" — responses that are incorrect or misleading — is a major challenge facing AI. Earlier this year, an AI feature launched by Apple on its iPhones generated fake news alerts.These included a false summary from the BBC News app notifications on a story about the PDC World Darts Championship semi-final, where it wrongly claimed that the British darts player Luke Littler had won the championship. Littler did not win the tournament's final until the next day. Apple told the BBC at the time that it was working on an update to resolve the problem which clarifies when Apple Intelligence is responsible for the text shown in the notifications. Musk added that \"some appreciation of beauty is important\" and that \"you know it when you see it.\" Musk said AI should want to know more about the nature of reality because humanity is more interesting than machines.\"It's more interesting to see the continuation if not the prosperity of humanity than to exterminate humanity,\" he said. Geoffrey Hinton, a computer scientist and ex-vice president at Google known as a \"Godfather of AI,\" said earlier this year that there's a \"10% to 20% chance\" that AI will \"wipe us out,\" in an episode of the Diary of a CEO podcast. Some of the shorter term risks he cited included hallucinations and the automation of entry level jobs.\"The hope is that if enough smart people do enough research with enough resources, we'll figure out a way to build them so they'll never want to harm us,\" Hinton added.",

    "body": "watch nowCostco sued the Trump administration to get a full refund of new tariffs it paid so far this year, and to block those import duties from continuing to be collected from the retail warehouse club giant as a Supreme Court case plays out.In the suit filed Friday, Costco said that it risks losing the money it has already paid to satisfy the tariffs even if the Supreme Court eventually upholds earlier lower court rulings that found President Donald Trump did not have the legal power to impose those duties.The company noted a looming Dec. 15 deadline that could prevent the tariffs that it has already paid on an estimated basis from being refunded. Costco did not say how much money it believes should be refunded to the company.Costco's suit, filed in the U.S Court of International Trade, said that U.S. Customs and Border Protection denied the company's request to extend the Dec. 15 date of so-called liquidation, the final computation of tariffs assessed on imported items. While an importer has six months to file a protest contesting liquidation, \"not all liquidations are protestable,\" the suit said.A shopper exits a Costco store in Centerville, Ohio, US, on Tuesday, Oct. 21, 2025. Kyle Grillot | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesDozens of other companies have filed similar lawsuits to protect their right to potential refunds in case the Supreme Court rules against the so-called reciprocal tariffs that Trump imposed on imports from many U.S. trading partners and his so-called fentanyl tariffs on products from Canada, China, and Mexico.Trump invoked the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to impose those often high tariffs. In August, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, in a 7-4 ruling, upheld a prior decision by the Court of International Trade that found Trump did not have that power.\"The core Congressional power to impose taxes such as tariffs is vested  exclusively in the legislative branch by the Constitution,\" the Federal Circuit said in its ruling. \"Tariffs are a core Congressional power.\"During oral arguments on Nov. 5, a majority of the Supreme Court's nine justices appeared skeptical of arguments by a lawyer for the Trump administration that the president did have the power to impose the tariffs.The Supreme Court took the administration's appeal of the lower court rulings on an expedited basis, but it is not clear when or how the court will decide the dispute.Costco, in its lawsuit, said, \"This separate action is necessary, however, because even if the IEEPA duties and underlying executive orders are held unlawful by the Supreme Court, importers that have paid IEEPA duties, including Plaintiff, are not guaranteed a refund for those unlawfully collected tariffs in the absence of their own judgment and judicial relief.\"Read more CNBC politics coverageJudge dismisses James Comey and Letitia James cases over 'unlawful' prosecutor appointmentSen.

Galaxy Z TriFold smartphone on display during a media preview in Seoul, South Korea, on Tuesday, Dec. 2, 2025.Bloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesLee added that Samsung's latest product is meant to test durability, hinge design and software performance while gathering real-world user insights before wider commercialization.The phone's three foldable panels can also run three apps vertically side by side, and offer a desktop-like mode without a separate display. The TriFold features Samsung's largest battery capacity among its foldable models and supports super-fast charging that reaches 50% in 30 minutes.TM Roh, who was recently appointed Samsung Electronics co-CEO and head of the Device eXperience division, said the Galaxy Z TriFold reflects years of work on foldable designs and aims to balance portability, performance and productivity in one device.Samsung was an early innovator of folding smartphones, unveiling its first foldable device in 2019. While the market has remained relatively small, new competitors have continued to enter, including Chinese brands that have proven competitive in both price and dimension.Visitors try out the Galaxy Z Trifold during Samsung Electronics' Galaxy Z TriFold media day at Samsung Gangnam in Seoul, South Korea, on Dec. 2, 2025.

Honor was spun off from Huawei in 2020 in a bid to avoid U.S. sanctions and tap international markets.Like Samsung's other recent foldables, the TriFold is rated IP48, meaning it is water-resistant up to 1.5 meters for up to 30 minutes but offers limited dust protection.",

    "body": "The Sinclair Broadcast Group, Inc. headquarters are seen July 17, 2024 in Cockeysville, Maryland.Kevin Dietsch | Getty ImagesThe broadcast television industry knows it needs to consolidate. It's just struggling with how to do it.In August, Nexstar Media Group, the largest owner of broadcast stations in the U.S., announced a proposed $6.2 billion deal to buy Tegna — a combination that would bring together more than 260 stations across the U.S. Last week, Sinclair, the owner of 179 local TV affiliates, made a hostile offer to acquire its smaller peer E.W. Scripps after buying up nearly 10% of the company on the open market. Both potential deals remain in limbo, and executives are getting antsy.Companies like Sinclair and Nexstar run the affiliate stations of the major networks across the U.S. known for local news, sports and other broadcast content. They face the same headwinds as their cable and content studio counterparts — the shrinking number of pay-TV customers due to the rise of streaming and tech options. Broadcast station owners remain profitable, largely from the hefty fees they receive from pay-TV distributors. About 65 million U.S. households still subscribe to a bundle of linear TV networks. Anywhere from 33% to 50% of a broadcast station group's annual revenue stems from retransmission fees — payments made to a broadcaster for the inclusion of local TV affiliates in pay-TV bundles — with advertising making up most of the rest.Yet profitability is shrinking for these companies as the universe of traditional bundle subscribers gets smaller. The streaming strategy for local news and TV has yet to come together, and like other parts of the media, local newsrooms and their resources are dwindling. That's made station owners desperate to consolidate, just as the biggest media companies — including Paramount, Warner Bros. Discovery and Comcast's NBCUniversal — continue to plan their own potential mergers. The impetus for deals among station owners is to cut duplicate costs and add scale to their businesses, increasing negotiating power when it comes time for carriage renewals with the largest pay-TV providers such as Comcast, Charter, Google's YouTube TV and DirecTV.While some are facing regulatory headwinds, for Sinclair, it's family ownership dynamics coupled with cultural and governance issues that have complicated its latest efforts to buy scale. Family squabblesSinclair has been looking for an acquisition target for nearly a year. The company announced in August it was launching a strategic review with an eye toward merging its broadcast station business with a peer. By that point Sinclair and its advisors had already held discussions with potential merger partners, CNBC previously reported. One of those targets was Gray Media, according to people familiar with the matter, who spoke on the condition of anonymity about internal plans. But the conversations with Gray haven't advanced, the people said, as Gray is already awaiting government approval for a much smaller deal and isn't in a rush to explore another transaction.Sinclair then set its sights on Scripps, the owner of more than 60 stations and a variety of entertainment channels like Ion and Bounce. Deal discussions started in the last year, according to people familiar with the matter.Thomas Fuller | SOPA Images | Lightrocket | Getty ImagesInitial talks revolved around creating a company where both the Scripps family and the Smith family, which owns the majority of Sinclair's voting shares, would give up majority control of a combined company but remain involved, according to people familiar with the matter. Those early talks included developing an independent board that would be in charge of making pivotal business decisions, such as whether and when to preempt national programming. In September, Sinclair and Nexstar both preempted episodes of \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\" after the late night host made controversial comments following the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. Throughout the Scripps deal discussions, Sinclair proposed three different variations of a transaction, including different stipulations of who would remain as CEO and whether the deal would be structured as a merger or an acquisition, said the people familiar. The Scripps family ultimately balked, in part due to governance issues and cultural concerns, two of the people said. In particular, Sinclair's controlling family is known for its conservative politics. In 2018 Sinclair made all of its owned stations air so-called \"must-runs\" — commentary that sometimes echoed viewpoints of then-and-now-U.S. President Donald Trump. That same year, Sinclair's attempt to to acquire Tribune ultimately failed amid both Federal Communications Commission concerns and criticism by Democrats and public advocacy groups over whether the merger was in the public interest.\"I think there's a lot of complexity to any transaction, especially transactions that involve family-controlled public companies with highly levered balance sheets,\" Scripps Chief Financial Officer Jason Combs said during Wells Fargo's TMT Summit in November. \"I think they'd add some complexity around a variety of issues, whether it's economic splits, whether it is impacts to the capital structure and potential there, whether it's governance issues. There's a whole range of issues.\"When discussions went quiet in September, Sinclair began buying Scripps shares weekly until its stake amounted to roughly 8% and it had to go public, per the Securities and Exchange Commission. Currently, Sinclair has a 9.9% stake in Scripps. Sinclair publicly announced last month it would pursue a hostile transaction of Scripps. In the days following Sinclair's public proposal to acquire Scripps for $7 per share — or more than $580 million — Scripps adopted a shareholder rights' plan, commonly known as a \"poison pill,\" to give it more time to consider the offer. \"We believe the strategic and financial rationale of a potential Sinclair-Scripps combination is indisputable,\" Sinclair said in a statement last week. \"Given the family control of Scripps, the only effect of adopting a poison pill is to limit the liquidity opportunities for public shareholders of Scripps.\"A Scripps spokesperson on Wednesday said the company adopted the poison pill \"to ensure that all shareholders receive full value in connection with any proposal to acquire the company.\" The plan is intended to ward off \"coercive tactics\" and expires after a year, the spokesperson said. Insider trading concernsThere could be an additional layer of complication, too. After Sinclair's SEC filing that disclosed it had amassed a stake in Scripps, attorneys for Scripps sent a letter to Sinclair raising questions around the stock purchases, according to two of the people familiar with the matter. As part of early deal discussions, Sinclair and Scripps signed a nondisclosure agreement and Sinclair received nonpublic information, the letter noted, according to the people. When Sinclair stopped receiving nonpublic information remains unclear, as do specific details of the nondisclosure agreement. That leaves open for interpretation whether Sinclair's recent maneuver is a securities violation, according to attorney Jonathan Hochman, founding partner of Schindler Cohen & Hochman. \"Assuming Sinclair received confidential information from Scripps under an NDA, whether any of that information was material and not stale is interesting, because, if so, buying Scripps stock while in possession of that information sounds a lot like insider trading,\" said Hochman, who is not involved in the Sinclair-Scripps matter. Representatives for Sinclair and Scripps declined to comment. Government holdupBeyond complex deal structures and family ownership dynamics, the biggest hurdle for broadcast station mergers at large is U.S. law. The FCC currently prevents any one company from owning broadcast stations that reach more than 39% of the U.S. TV households. That threshold doesn't threaten a potential Sinclair-Scripps merger — which Sinclair has said would easily win regulatory approval — but it puts Nexstar's proposed acquisition of Tegna at risk. In order to go through, Nexstar's deal would require the lifting of the decades-old FCC rule, or at least significant waivers. \"We are focused on achieving deregulation, and we continue to advocate for the elimination of the antiquated constraints on local television ownership as the best solution to level the competitive playing field for all media,\" Nexstar CEO Perry Sook said in a November release when requesting approval for the Tegna deal. In addition to the 39% nationwide cap, broadcasters would also like to eliminate another law on the books that prevents one company from owning three or more ABC, CBS, Fox or NBC affiliates in a given media market. FCC Chairman Brendan Carr has been vocal about his support for reforming the laws. In one instance earlier this year, Carr reportedly called the ownership cap \"arcane, artificial limits,\" adding that such rules don't \"apply to Big Tech.\" In late September the FCC said it would review the ownership rules. But the changes have yet to take place, and the opposition's voice is getting louder. In addition, the Department of Justice has also been slow moving toward approving deals in the industry, creating a hurdle for deals of all sizes, one of the people said. Trump recently slammed the proposed consolidation of the industry in a Truth Social post. Meanwhile, Chris Ruddy, CEO of conservative cable TV channel Newsmax and a Trump supporter, is against FCC rules changes, arguing consolidation limits the number of potential voices and raises cable prices for Americans by giving more leverage to the affiliate groups. A representative for Carr didn't respond to requests for comment. U.S. President-elect Donald Trump speaks to Brendan Carr, his intended pick for Chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, as he attends a viewing of the launch of the sixth test flight of the SpaceX Starship rocket on November 19, 2024 in Brownsville, Texas. Brandon Bell | Getty ImagesThe argument against these mergers from the pay-TV distributors is that higher fees get passed down to consumers, which would likely amplify the hemorrhaging of traditional bundle customers. They also say it's unclear how consolidation of these companies would help the local news industry, as the station owners argue. \"Sinclair is brazenly seeking a mega-footprint nationwide and in local markets across the country, which will allow them to impose even more exorbitant retransmission consent fees. These higher prices will leave consumers with a painful choice—pay up or lose your programming,\" said Grant Spellmeyer,   president and CEO of America's Communications Association, an advocacy group for distributors, in a statement. Curtis LeGeyt, President and CEO of the National Association of Broadcasters, the industry's trade association, said in a statement to CNBC that local broadcasters are \"not asking for special treatment; we are asking for the ability to compete in today's media landscape.\" \"Lifting the arbitrary 39% limit, which applies only to broadcast stations, will allow station groups to invest in local journalism, sports rights and the technology that keeps communities informed during emergencies, especially in smaller markets,\" he said. \"The national cap was imposed during an era before broadband and streaming reshaped how Americans get their news, and the longer Washington delays addressing it, the harder it becomes for local stations to sustain the trusted local news and reporting that Americans rely on every day.\" Disclosure: Comcast is the parent company of NBCUniversal, which owns CNBC. Versant would become the new parent company of CNBC upon Comcast’s planned spinoff of Versant.",

    "body": "Attendees pass an Amazon Web Services logo during AWS re:Invent 2024, a conference hosted by Amazon Web Services, at The Venetian hotel in Las Vegas on Dec. 3, 2024.Noah Berger | Getty ImagesAmazon has found a way to let cloud clients extensively customize generative AI models. The catch is that the system costs $100,000 per year.The Nova Forge offering from Amazon Web Services gives organizations access to Amazon's AI models in various stages of training so they can incorporate their own data earlier in the process. Already, companies can fine-tune large language models after they've been trained. The results with Nova Forge will lean more heavily on the data that customers supply. Nova Forge customers will also have the option to refine open-weight models, but training data and computing infrastructure are not included. Organizations that assemble their own models might end up spending hundreds of millions or billions of dollars, which means using Nova Forge is more affordable, Amazon said.AWS released its own models under the Nova brand in 2024, but they aren't the first choice for most software developers. A July survey from Menlo Ventures said that by the middle of this year, Amazon-backed Anthropic controlled 32% of the market for enterprise LLMs, followed by OpenAI with 25%, Google with 20% and Meta with 9% — Amazon Nova had a less than 5% share, a Menlo spokesperson said.The Nova models are available through AWS' Bedrock service for running models on Amazon cloud infrastructure, as are Anthropic's Claude 4.5 models.\"We are a frontier lab that has focused on customers,\" Rohit Prasad, Amazon head scientist for artificial general intelligence, told CNBC in an interview. \"Our customers wanted it. We have invented on their behalf to make this happen.\"Nova Forge is also in use by internal Amazon customers, including teams that work on the company's stores and the Alexa AI assistant, Prasad said. Reddit needed an AI model for moderating content that would be sophisticated about the many subjects people discuss on the social network. Engineers found that a Nova model enhanced with Reddit data through Forge performed better than commercially available large-scale models, Prasad said. Booking.com, Nimbus Therapeutics, the Nomura Research Institute and Sony are also building models with Forge, Amazon said.Organizations can request that Amazon engineers help them build their Forge models, but that assistance is not included in the new service's $100,000 annual fee.AWS is also introducing new models for developers at its Reinvent conference in Las Vegas this week.Nova 2 Pro is a reasoning model whose tests show it performs at least as well as Anthropic's Claude Sonnet 4.5, OpenAI's GPT-5 and GPT-5.1, and Google's Gemini 3.0 Pro Preview, Amazon said. Reasoning involves running a series of computations that might take extra time in response to requests to produce better answers. Nova 2 Pro will be available in early access to AWS customers with Forge subscriptions, Prasad said. That means Forge customers and Amazon engineers will be able to try Nova 2 Pro at the same time. Nova 2 Omni is another reasoning model that can process incoming images, speech, text and videos, and it generates images and text. It's the first reasoning model with that range of capability, Amazon said. Amazon hopes that, by delivering a multifaceted model, it can lower the cost and complexity of incorporating AI models into applications.Tens of thousands of organizations are using Nova models each week, Prasad said. AWS has said it has millions of customers. Nova is the second-most popular family of models in Bedrock, Prasad said. The top group of models are from Anthropic.WATCH: Amazon set to kick off AI conference next week: Maxim's Tom Forte on what to expectwatch now",

    "body": "Nurphoto | Nurphoto | Getty ImagesThe term Digital Asset Treasury companies, known as DATs or DATCOs, has emerged as one of the biggest buzzwords in the digital currency industry this year, providing investors with a novel way to play crypto — but with new risks. A DAT is effectively a publicly-listed entity that holds cryptocurrencies like bitcoin or ether and provides investors with exposure to the underlying digital currency. DATs aim to outperform the price action of the cryptocurrency that they hold. But with crypto markets seeing a big plunge in recent weeks, the strategies of DATs has come under scrutiny and raised concerns about whether they could add further pressure to an already weak crypto market.What is a DAT?A Digital Asset Treasury is a type of company that buys and holds cryptocurrencies directly on its balance sheet. Investors can buy shares of that entity to get exposure to the underlying digital asset.The original — and one of the biggest DATs — is Michael Saylor's Strategy which began buying bitcoin in 2020 and has done so ever since. But more recently, there has been an explosion of this type of vehicle. In 2021, fewer than 10 companies held bitcoin in their treasuries, according to DLA Piper. That number has since jumped to 190 companies, while another 10 to 20 firms are focused on alternative digital assets as of September, DLA Piper said.These DATs hold around $100 billion worth of cryptocurrencies combined, according to data from The Block.Why do DATs exist?The DAT explosion this year has been driven by buoyant crypto markets and more favorable regulation in the United States toward the industry.But their growth has also come at a time when it's easier than ever to buy cryptocurrencies directly or invest in the asset via other regulated entities like exchange-traded funds (ETFs). DATs are intended to outperform the underlying assets which they hold. They can achieve this through various strategies to maximise returns. In contrast, ETFs effectively hold the cryptocurrency passively and issue shares backed one-to-one with the actual asset.Should any of the key variables — investor sentiment, crypto prices, or capital market liquidity — fall, the DATCO model could unravel.MacquarieDATs can also provide regulatory certainty to investors, according to a note from Macquarie published last week. They \"package crypto assets within SEC-regulated securities,\" the investment bank's analysts said. \"This eliminates regulatory ambiguity and ensures the same public reporting, disclosures, and investor protections as any public equity.\"Carol Alexander, professor of finance at Sussex University, told CNBC that DATs also offer an option to \"institutional and professional investors with regulatory, fiduciary or operational constraints that make direct token ownership or crypto ETFs unsuitable.\"DAT strategies DATs offer unique capabilities that ETFs cannot, employing a range of strategies to enhance investor returns.To assess the performance of these DATs, a metric known as market net asset value, or mNAV, is closely watched. It compares a company's enterprise value to the value of its digital asset holdings. It can show how much of a premium investors are assigning to a DAT, with an mNAV over 1 signifying a premium.watch nowDATs can use an at-the-market (ATM) equity program to increase their crypto holdings. When its share price exceeds the net asset value of the crypto holdings, a DAT can issue more shares at a premium and therefore raise cash. That allows the DAT to fund the purchase of more crypto — as has been the case for Strategy.\"This creates a crypto-per-share accretive feedback loop: the issuer raises equity, accumulates tokens, and sees its NAV per share increase, further increasing the premium, representing accretive dilution,\" Macquarie explained. Staking is another strategy that is employed by DATs. It allows a holder of cryptocurrency to earn yield, similar to interest, on their assets. To stake, an investor effectively locks up their crypto on a blockchain to help the network run better. In return, the investor receives a return in the form of more crypto. However, unstaking crypto can take several weeks, which may limit ETFs and similar products from fully embracing staking, given their need for liquidity and stable asset values.Staking creates free cash flow that \"can be redeployed into mergers and acquisitions (M&A), token purchases, on-chain opportunities, or shareholder distributions,\" ARK Invest said in a note last month. As the market advances, there are likely to be new trading strategies employed by DATs. What happens to DATs when the market plunges?DATs have come into focus amid recent crypto market turmoil, with bitcoin well off its all-time high. As crypto prices fall, mNAV may fall under 1, meaning companies are trading at a discount to their crypto holdings. This can create a number of issues. \"When the crypto market pulls back, DATCOs face pressure and they have a limited menu of realistic responses,\" Alexander said. \"Some may double‑down and hold, viewing the drop as a buying opportunity for future appreciation. Others may need liquidity, especially those that used financing (e.g. debt, convertible bonds, share issuance) which can force them to sell part of their token holdings.\"And an mNAV premium is key for the DAT market.\"The viability of DATCOs is closely tied to the persistence of an equity premium to NAV. If this premium erodes or reverses to a discount, the model faces significant challenges,\" Macquarie analysts said.watch nowThe investment bank also notes that if a DAT's stock price falls or near NAV, equity issuance becomes dilutive, meaning \"new shares issued no longer increase crypto per share, but rather dilute existing shareholders' exposure. This can break the self-reinforcing cycle that sustains the premium.\"Meanwhile, the explosion in the number of DATs and growing interest from investors creates its own risks.\"The sector is becoming increasingly crowded, with capital flowing in according to an established playbook. This influx, however, increases structural fragility. Should any of the key variables - investor sentiment, crypto prices, or capital market liquidity - fall, the DATCO model could unravel,\" Macquarie said.Strategy has sought to protect itself against the downturn. On Monday, the company announced a $1.44 billion U.S. dollar reserve that was funded by the sale of more stock. The reserve is designed to support the payment of dividends and service debt, Strategy said.James Butterfill, head of research at CoinShares, said other DATs may follow Strategy's decision to dilute shareholders.\"It is not particularly confidence-inspiring: it highlights both their dependence on, and their expectation of, a recovery in token prices,\" Butterfill told CNBC.\"We do expect token prices to rebound, particularly if the Federal Reserve delivers a December rate cut, which should help these companies avoid forced liquidations. Nevertheless, the episode underscores the inherent fragility of the DAT model.\"Will DATs impact crypto prices?If mNAVs continue to fall and DATs don't have the means to keep afloat, they may turn to selling digital tokens which could put pressure on crypto markets.\"As token prices drop, even the highest‑profile DATs have begun scaling back. This can amplify volatility in the broader crypto markets, because DATs are large holders: their sales, even if staggered, increase supply into already weakened liquidity conditions,\" Alexander said. For now, DATs' digital currency holdings account for less than 1% of the total crypto market. But as their influence potentially grows, they may have more of an impact on braoder markets.\"As DATCOs scale, their market influence grows; an unwind could weaken a major tailwind for crypto, namely the normalization of digital assets on corporate balance sheets,\" Macquarie said. \"This, in turn, could dampen public equity interest in digital asset exposure, slow crypto ETF inflows, and pressure cryptocurrency prices.\"Has the DAT bubble burst?The DAT space is currently in a bubble, according to Sussex University's Alexander.\"The DATCO model seems to have attracted many entrants driven more by marketing, hype and easy capital than by durable business fundamentals,\" she told CNBC. CoinShares' Butterfill said the \"bubble has already decisively burst,\" with many DATs now trading at mNAVs below 1 and a \"clear signal that the market fears\" these companies will be forced to sell their digital assets. However, both experts said DATs may evolve in the future.\"Over the longer term, investors are likely to demand a more measured approach,\" Butterfill said. watch now\"Tolerance for shareholder dilution and for extremely high token concentrations without accompanying revenue streams will diminish. The recent frenzy of token accumulation has, in many ways, undermined the original intent of the DAT concept: credible global companies seeking diversification from fiat-currency and depreciation risks.\"Alexander said that these digital asset treasury firms may also begin to diversify their holdings into non-crypto assets too. \"I believe those that pivot toward operations such as yield‑generation through staking, increasing the diversification of their tokens, and mix with token traditional assets like cash or T-bills, may survive as legitimate digital‑asset infrastructure players,\" Alexander said.

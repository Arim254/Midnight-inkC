    "body": "When I think back on my childhood, my happiest memories aren't tied to things I owned. They're about the freedom of growing up in a small Ohio town where everyone knew your name and kids ran in packs.The neighborhood park was our meeting place. A few bikes tossed in a friend's front yard signaled the game was on. There were no texts or group chats. But childhood today often looks different. Connection revolves around gaming consoles, phones, sneakers, and the next must-have gadget. If you can't afford it, you risk being left out.That contrast led me to talk to my 79-year-old dad, a man who wears thriftiness the way others wear luxury. He genuinely enjoys finding new ways to save money. He never tried to keep up with anyone. While others rushed to buy the newest car or gadget, he was content with what he had. That mindset made him the quintessential millionaire next door.He helped shaped my relationship with money. I don't feel compelled to chase status or possessions. Here are eight lessons from my frugal dad that have stood the test of time — and how they still apply today.1. Let your values guide your financial decisionsEvery dollar you spend is a vote for the life you want to build. When your spending aligns with what matters most, money feels less like sacrifice and more like purpose. For couples especially, shared values turn financial decisions into a source of clarity instead of conflict.2. You can always earn more money, but not timeImagine you could swap places with legendary investor Warren Buffett, now 95. Would you? Time is scarce and unrecoverable, unlike money. Remember this when deciding whether to take a promotion just for a bigger paycheck, even if it means less time with family; or working longer hours for a fancier car when your current one works fine; or buying a bigger house when your kids already attend a great school in a safe neighborhood.3. The best investment you can make is in yourselfThe returns on personal growth compound for decades. Education, learning a new skill, reading widely, or even investing in therapy can strengthen both your earning potential and your resilience. In a partnership, personal growth benefits everyone — stronger individuals make stronger teams.4. Debt steals tomorrow’s optionsEvery borrowed dollar limits future freedom. A loan may feel manageable today, but it quietly shapes your choices tomorrow, from the jobs you can take to where you can live. Prioritizing flexibility over financing buys peace of mind and the ability to pivot when life changes.5. Turn off the lights when you leave the roomTurning the lights off is a metaphor for the small things we do. It’s more than about saving a few cents on electricity; it’s a mindfulness practice. Every small act of frugality adds up, and it builds awareness of how we use our resources. 6. Celebrate simplicityA quiet life is often an intentional one. Choosing simplicity means choosing time over things, presence over pressure, and meaning over noise. Less clutter often leads to less stress — and more room for what actually matters.7. New cars destroy wealthThe average new car now sells for over $50,000, and when you factor in financing, fuel, and insurance, monthly costs can exceed $1,200. Vehicles that are about three years old often hit the sweet spot between price and reliability. Investing the difference between new and used can significantly boost long-term net worth.8. Being cheap and being frugal aren’t the same thingCheapness cuts corners at all costs. Frugality focuses on getting value for your money. A frugal person maintains what they own, spends intentionally, and is generous where it counts. Understanding that difference can prevent endless money conflicts because frugality builds a meaningful life, while cheapness slowly erodes joy.Brian Page is the founder of Modern Husbands, a company dedicated to helping couples manage both financial and home responsibilities as a team.

    "body": "After years of steep increases, renters are finally seeing sustained price relief, a trend that appears to be carrying into early 2026.In November, the median asking rent across the 50 largest U.S. metro areas was $1,693, down about 1% from a year earlier and marking the 28th consecutive month of year-over-year declines, according to Realtor.com listings data. Nationally, the median rent fell to $1,367, down 1.1% from a year earlier, according to Apartment List's data.November is typically the slowest month for rentals, but rents fell more from October to November this year than they did over the same period last year, according to Apartment List.With new apartment supply still hitting the market, rents are expected to remain lower into 2026.\"Barring a major economic shock, 2026 is shaping up to be one of the more renter-friendly periods we've seen in a decade,\" says Michelle Griffith, a luxury real estate broker at Douglas Elliman.Why rents are coolingRent relief comes after a sharp run-up in prices earlier in the decade. Prices for one- and two-bedroom rentals were rising at an annual pace above 12% in mid-2021 and mid-2022 amid high demand, according to Realtor.com data. Since early 2023, rent growth has turned negative as a surge of new apartment supply entered the market.In 2024, more than 600,000 new multifamily apartment units — typically large, managed apartment buildings — were completed nationwide, the most in a single year since the 1980s, according to Apartment List.The biggest rent cuts have shown up in these buildings, where the surge of supply has forced landlords to compete for tenants.\"We're seeing price wars within buildings, longer days on market, and the need for multiple price reductions just to generate foot traffic,\" says Jaclyn Bild, a real estate broker associate at Douglas Elliman. Prices for detached homes and higher-end rentals have held more steady, with demand remaining relatively strong, she says.Where rents are falling the mostRent relief hasn't been uniform, as conditions vary widely by market. The sharpest declines have occurred in fast-growing Sun Belt and interior Western metros with a surge in new housing supply in recent years—especially Austin.These 10 cities recorded some of the steepest year-over-year drops in median asking rent in November, using data for the 50 largest U.S. metro areas, according to Realtor.com.Austin–Round Rock–San Marcos, Texas: −6.6%Denver–Aurora–Centennial, Colorado: −4.8%Birmingham, Alabama: −4.6%Jacksonville, Florida: −4.2%Phoenix–Mesa–Chandler, Arizona: −4.0%San Diego–Chula Vista–Carlsbad, California: −3.5%Las Vegas–Henderson–North Las Vegas, Nevada: −3.0%Houston–Pasadena–The Woodlands, Texas: −2.7%Miami–Fort Lauderdale–West Palm Beach, Florida: −2.7%San Antonio–New Braunfels, Texas: −2.7%While rents remain well above pre-pandemic levels, the momentum has shifted in many markets.High vacancies and a wave of new apartments still coming onto the market are expected to keep rent growth limited into early 2026, with prices leveling off later in the year rather than rebounding quickly, according to Apartment List.\"This is a good time to negotiate rather than assume the asking rent is fixed,\" says Griffith. \"Landlords are far more open to concessions, flexible lease terms, or modest rent reductions than they were even a year ago. Locking in a lease during periods of elevated supply, especially in late winter or early spring, can provide cost certainty before demand picks up again.\"Want to give your kids the ultimate advantage?

Resume Genius's latest report identified the jobs that offer the highest pay without requiring a four-year college degree, using data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.The report demonstrates that \"there's no one way to get a high-paying job,\" according to Resume Genius career expert Eva Chan. \"All of the jobs do have some degree of training, some have schooling, but they're all very attainable without a degree,\" she says.Blue-collar jobs like electrical power-line installer and repairer are becoming increasingly popular, according to Chan.\"Maybe 10 to 15 years ago, they weren't seen as lucrative,\" Chan says, but more people are realizing that blue-collar roles and skilled trades can offer \"high pay\" and plenty of growth opportunities.Management and sales roles like insurance sales agent are ideal for people who have strong interpersonal skills, according to Chan.\"Your pay can increase pretty quickly if you're consistent and you're good with building relationships,\" she says.

However, the updated guidance on email address changes appears only in the Hindi version of Google's support page, suggesting the rollout may begin in India or Hindi-speaking markets.The support page said the feature is gradually rolling out to all users, suggesting full global adoption is coming, but could take some time.The English-language page retains prior guidance stating that @gmail.com addresses \"usually cannot be changed.\" Google did not immediately respond to CNBC's inquiry about which regions would be the first to receive the feature. Under the new policy, users who change their address will automatically keep their original address as an alias. Emails sent to the old address will continue to arrive in the inbox, and the original address will still work for signing in to Google services like Drive, Maps and YouTube. Previously, users seeking a new Gmail address had to create a new account and transfer their data manually through a complicated and fraught process that could disrupt integrations with third-party apps.Google said existing data, including photos, messages and emails would remain unchanged after an address update. Users can also reuse the old Google account email address at any time, according to a Google translation of the support page in Hindi.However, accounts that change their Gmail address won't be able to create another new Gmail address for the next 12 months and cannot delete the new chosen address. Google has not issued a formal press release or announcement about the change, which was reportedly first discovered within user forums and tech communities.",

    "body": "As a clinical psychologist, I often have to caution clients to examine the sparks that they feel for a new romantic prospect.You want to be excited about someone new and feel a deep connection to them. But many of us carry old wounds from our childhood, previous relationships, or formative experiences. If your past was chaotic, inconsistent, and confusing, then you may be drawn to those same relationship dynamics again and again. Here are five signs that the chemistry you feel might actually be a red flag.1. The relationship makes you feel on edgeIn your past, if someone made you feel loved but also anxious, your nervous system learned that loving and fearing the same person was okay.Mixed signals, hot and cold affection, and inconsistency can then feel intimate rather than anxiety-inducing. Excitement and anxiety are closely related emotions, so you feel on edge, but mistake this feeling for excitement and chemistry.What to do: Slow down and notice how your body feels around this person. Does your nervous system settle when you are around them or are you always on edge? If it's the latter, that may be a signal that the feeling you have isn't chemistry, and that this person makes you feel unsafe.2. The highs and lows feel addictiveThe emotional rollercoaster when someone pulls away and the relief when they come close again can feel like a spark, especially if you had relationship dynamics like that in the past. When you are stressed, your body releases hormones such as cortisol, which activates reward and addiction pathways in your brain. As a result, you may unconsciously chase that stress, conflict, unpredictability, and intensity because it gives your body a hit of the feel-good chemicals that it craves.What to do: Your body needs to learn how to slow down and feel safe again. This can look like stretching, breathwork, meditation, nature walks, and decreasing your workload.3. You keep going back to themBeing drawn to someone doesn't always mean the chemistry is good. You may be unconsciously trying to gain mastery over an old wound by reenacting the pain. You believe that you can make it right this time. You might also recreate painful dynamics that mirror your past because you can predict what happens, and this gives you a false sense of control.What to do: Self-reflection is important here. Does this person remind you of something from your past? Therapy can provide you with a safe space to unpack your history. 4. Jealousy feels excitingIf it feels exciting when your partner is jealous, this isn't chemistry — it is your insecurity rearing its head. You might even do something on purpose to trigger their jealousy in order to feel closer to them or make them prove to you that you are wanted. In your mind, this might sound like, \"If they choose me, then I'm finally good enough,\" or, \"If they chase me, it means they love me enough.\"What to do: Work on yourself so your validation comes from within, not from other people. Remember who you are outside of the context of this relationship, and that you are already more than enough. 5. Things are never calmSteady connection should feel grounding and safe. But if your nervous system is used to chaos, calm can feel boring and even uncomfortable. You may catch yourself thinking there's no spark, and then chase the next thrill by creating tension, initiating conflict, or even leaving the relationship. If you feel safe and you aren't used to that, in your mind, this might sound like, \"If I feel safe, I'll let my guard down but then I'll get hurt.\"The lack of spark doesn't mean there isn't chemistry. It might just mean there isn't anxiety. What to do: Teach your body that it's okay to feel calm. When you feel like you want to create conflict or chase a thrill, stop and notice that. Then practice doing the opposite of what your urges are, and waiting for them to pass.Noticing patterns in your relationships is a great first step. Of course, you should always consult with your physician or therapist before making significant changes. Understanding how to slow down and process your past can help you relearn what safety and consistency feel like.Dr. Amy Tran is a clinical psychologist.

    "body": "American consumers aren't feeling great about the economy or their own financial situation, with the phrase \"affordability crisis\" dominating headlines and political campaigns over the last few months.The majority — 70% — of Americans surveyed in a Marist poll of over 1,400 adults taken in December, say that the cost of living in their area is not very affordable, or not affordable at all, for the average family.While President Donald Trump called the word \"affordability\" a \"con job by the Democrats,\" in a speech in early December, other politicians have insisted it's an issue for their constituents. \"The affordability crisis is not a hoax, it is a reality felt by Americans everywhere.\" Rep. Sarah McBride, D-Del. said in a newsletter.Nearly half of Americans say their financial situation is worse than a year ago, a recent Credit Karma survey found. And consumer sentiment in December sank 29% from 2024 according to the University of Michigan's monthly survey. While annual inflation is down from the historic highs the U.S. saw in 2022, prices for everyday essentials remain elevated, and in some categories continue to rise. In November 2025, coffee prices were up nearly 19% from the previous year and the cost of beef was up around 15%, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data. Housing costs rose over 14% between September 2023 and September 2025, per Bureau of Labor Statistics data. Medical costs are up nearly 7% over the same period, and costs for services are up over 8%. While some of those price increases are related to supply issues, Trump's tariff agenda has also pushed prices on essentials like bananas and coffee and discretionary items like toys and electronics.\"It's not like people are overspending,\" Joey Khoury, partner and senior wealth advisor at Mission Wealth, says. Middle and lower-earners especially aren't \"spending lavishly,\" he adds, but as living costs have risen it's become harder for them to stay within their normal budgets.Consumers are 'trying to muscle through'Consumer spending has increased with each subsequent quarter, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis, despite worsening sentiment and weakening consumer confidence, per The Conference Board's monthly survey.\"What we're seeing is there is still inflation pressure across the system, particularly in the retail environment, and consumers, through our research tell us that they are effectively trying to muscle through this,\" Will Auchincloss, Americas retail sector leader at EY-Parthenon, says. \"They're trying to buy what they've always bought or want to buy, but in the face of higher prices.\"Higher earners may be cutting back on some nonessentials, including vitamins and supplements, he says, or trading down to lower-cost alternatives.However, lower earners are \"not just talking about pulling back,\" he says. \"They are actively pulling back and having a hard time making ends meet.\"\"Consumers are balancing many pressures,\" including tariffs, sticky inflation and a softening labor market, says Leanna Haakons, a business development and marketing expert, and president of Black Hawk Financial.At the same time, \"they're still seeking a sense of normalcy and value in their purchases,\" Haakons says. For some households, she says, that means being more selective about what they do buy.  \"Consumers are buying fewer items overall, but focusing on high-value, more meaningful purchases, durable goods, gifts, things for the household, home upgrades, things that really are valuable to their day to day life,\" Haakons says.Some are borrowing to get byWhile they may be steadily spending, many consumers are also relying on credit cards and buy now, pay later (BNPL) loans to fund their purchases.Credit card debt rose to a collective $1.23 trillion in the U.S. as of the third quarter of 2025, according to New York Fed data. And a growing number of Americans say they're using BNPL plans to pay for groceries, a LendingTree survey found in April.\"Consumers are borrowing more and more to cover the spending challenges they've got, and that obviously can't go on forever,\" Auchincloss says. As of the fourth quarter of 2025, growing shares of consumers are already changing behaviors according to McKinsey & Company research. Nearly a third of adults (29%) say they've dipped into their savings in the last three months, up from 26% in Q3. Another 29% say they've reduced their savings rate, also up from 26% in the third quarter. And 28% are using credit cards more, up from 26%, McKinsey finds. BNPL usage also ticked up by a percentage point over the same period.New year, same problemConsumers are hopeful they'll be able to find their financial footing in 2026 and many are optimistic about meeting their goals, the Credit Karma survey found. Still, 32% of Americans expect things to get worse in the new year, according to a recent Bankrate survey.Rent prices may cool off in 2026, experts at real estate firm Douglas Elliman recently told CNBC Make It. But overall inflation is expected to stay at or above 3% throughout the year, economists at Deloitte and Fitch Ratings predict.\"The smartest approach for households heading into 2026 is to be selective with spending, prioritizing debt repayment going into the new year,\" Haakons says. She encourages folks to pay off their credit card balances and try to time major purchases \"wisely,\" taking advantage of potential interest rate cuts later in the year. \"It's important to be prudent going into 2026,\" she adds, \"because there are some strong signals that there could be some more difficult times ahead for employment.\"Want to give your kids the ultimate advantage?

    "body": "Waymo autonomous taxis turns onto Post Street in San Francisco, California, US, on Wednesday, Dec. 17, 2025. David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesWaymo temporarily paused its robotaxi service in the San Francisco Bay Area on Thursday, ahead of expected storms in the area, according to a customer notification in the company's driverless ride-hailing app.\"Service temporarily paused due to National Weather Service flash flood warning,\" the notification read.Earlier this week the Alphabet-owned company said it will update its fleet so its robotaxi service is better able to perform during power outages.On Dec. 20, Waymo paused service during a blackout in San Francisco that left tens of thousands of people in the area without power and caused some of its autonomous vehicles to halt in mid-traffic, contributing to or causing gridlock.The National Weather Service extended a flood watch for the entire San Francisco Bay Area through Friday 10 p.m. local time.Waymo didn't immediately respond to a request for comment, or say whether regulators required its service pause on Thursday given the flash flood warnings.The California Public Utilities Commission — which regulates driverless ride-hailing services in the state — did not immediately respond to requests for information during the Christmas holiday on Thursday.Waymo currently operates a commercial, driverless service in five U.S. markets, up from three at the end of 2024. Waymo's robotaxi service has been operating in Austin, the San Francisco Bay Area, Phoenix, Atlanta and Los Angeles this year. The company intends to significantly expand its service area across and beyond the U.S. in 2026, CNBC previously reported.Waymo is facing increased public scrutiny and safety concerns as it attempts to expand its robotaxi service.The former CEO of San Francisco's Municipal Transit Authority, Jeffrey Tumlin, told CNBC that regulators and robotaxi companies can take valuable lessons away from the chaos that arose with Waymo vehicles during the PG&E power outages last week.\"I think we need to be asking 'what is a reasonable number of [autonomous vehicles] to have on city streets, by time of day, by geography and weather?'\" Tumlin said. He also suggested regulators may want to set up a staged system that will allow autonomous vehicle companies to rapidly scale their operations, provided they meet specific tests.One of those tests, he said, would be how quickly a company can get their autonomous vehicles safely out of the way of traffic if they encounter something that is confusing like a four-way intersection with no functioning traffic lights.Cities and regulators should also seek more data from robotaxi companies about the planned or actual performance of their vehicles during expected emergencies such as blackouts, floods or earthquakes, Tumlin said.",

    "body": "US President Donald Trump, flanked by Navy Secretary John Phelan (R), announces the US Navy's new Golden Fleet initiative, unveiling a new class of frigates, at Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach, Florida, on December 22, 2025. Andrew Caballero-Reynolds | Afp | Getty ImagesOn Monday, U.S. President Donald Trump unveiled plans for a new \"Trump-class\" battleship, declaring it would be \"the fastest, the biggest, and by far, 100 times more powerful than any battleship ever built.\" He hailed the ships as \"some of the most lethal surface warfare ships,\" promising they would \"help maintain American military supremacy [and] inspire fear in America's enemies all over the world.\"But there is one glaring problem: battleships have been obsolete for decades. The last was built more than 80 years ago, and the U.S. Navy retired the last Iowa-class ships nearly 30 years ago. Once symbols of naval might with their massive guns, battleships have long since been eclipsed by aircraft carriers and modern destroyers armed with long-range missiles.While labeling the new surface combatants as \"battleships\" could be a misnomer, defense experts say that there remain several gaps between Trump's vision and modern naval warfare.Mark Cancian, a senior adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, dismissed the idea, writing in a Dec. 23 commentary that \"there is little need for said discussion because this ship will never sail.\" He contended the program would take too long to design, cost far too much and run counter to the Navy's current strategy of distributed firepower.\"A future administration will cancel the program before the first ship hits the water,\" Cancian said.Bernard Loo, senior fellow at Singapore's S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies, described the proposal as \"a prestige project more than anything else.\" He compared it to Japan's World War II super-battleships Yamato and Musashi — the largest ever built — which were sunk by carrier-borne aircraft before playing a significant role in combat.Photograph of the IJN Yamato, the lead ship of the Yamato class of battleships that served with the Imperial Japanese Navy during World War II. Dated 1941. (Photo by: Photo12/Universal Images Group via Getty Images)Photo 12 | Universal Images Group | Getty Images\"Historically, we looked at battleships and the bigger the better... [and] in a very layman's perspective of strategy, size matters,\" Loo said. He added that the size of the proposed battleship — displacing more than 35,000 tons and measuring more than 840 feet, or a little over two football fields long — would make it a \"bomb magnet.\"\"The size and the prestige value of it all make it an even more tempting target, potentially for your adversary,\" Loo said.Bryan Clark, a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute, suggested Trump may be drawn to the symbolic power of battleships, which were the most visible icons of naval firepower for much of the 20th century.The USS Missouri, completed in 1944 and the last U.S. battleship built, famously hosted Japan's surrender in 1945.Japanese surrender signatories arrive aboard the USS Missouri to participate in surrender ceremonies, Tokyo Bay, Japan, U.S. Army Signal Corps, September 2, 1945. (Photo by: Circa Images/GHI/Universal History Archive/Universal Images Group via Getty Images)Universal History Archive | Universal Images Group | Getty ImagesClark noted that the U.S. Navy recommissioned four World War II battleships in the 1980s as part of its 600-ship fleet expansion strategy during the Cold War to counter the Soviet Union. \"This may be an era in which the president believes the U.S. last had naval supremacy.\"Battleships last saw combat in 1991, when retrofitted Iowa-class battleships provided shore bombardment fire support to coalition forces in the first Gulf War.The battleship USS Wisconsin (BB-64) launches a BGM-109 Tomahawk missile against a target in Iraq during Operation Desert Storm. (Photo by © CORBIS/Corbis via Getty Images)Historical | Corbis Historical | Getty ImagesWhat's in a name?Clark noted that the classification matters less than the weapons a ship carries.According to the U.S. Navy, the Trump-class battleship — part of a new \"golden fleet\" of warships — will be equipped with weapons such as conventional guns and missiles, as well as electronic rail guns and laser-based weaponry. It will also be able to carry nuclear and hypersonic missiles.Such a vessel would essentially function like a large destroyer, regardless of whether it is called a battleship.However, CSIS' Cancian countered that such a design runs against the Navy's distributed operations model, which seeks to reduce vulnerability by spreading firepower across many assets. \"This proposal would go in the other direction, building a small number of large, expensive, and potentially vulnerable assets,\" he wrote.Even if the Trump-class battleship proves technically feasible, analysts said cost would be the decisive obstacle.Loo said U.S. weapons programs routinely exceed timelines and budgets.The Navy's Zumwalt‑class destroyers — the largest surface combatants currently at 15,000 tons — were reduced from 32 to three ships due to spiraling costs. More recently, the Constellation‑class frigate was canceled due to design and workforce challenges.Clark estimated the Trump‑class would cost two to three times more than today's destroyers. With Arleigh Burke destroyers priced at about $2.7 billion each, that implies a single battleship could cost upward of $8 billion.The cost of crewing and maintaining them will put more pressure on an already strained Navy budget, he added.RSIS' Loo was more critical in his assessment, calling the decision a strategic mistake. \"At the very least, as far as I'm concerned, it's strategic hubris.\"",

    "body": "watch nowRecently appointed NASA Administrator Jared Isaacman on Friday told CNBC that the U.S. will return to the moon within President Donald Trump's second term. Isaacman, a close ally of SpaceX CEO Elon Musk, told CNBC's \"Closing Bell Overtime\" that Trump's recommitment to exploring the moon is key to unlocking the \"orbital economy.\"\"We want to have that opportunity to explore and realize the scientific, economic and national security potential on the moon,\" he said. Isaacman's comments on Friday were some of his first public remarks since being confirmed to his position by the Senate last week, after a long saga throughout 2025. Trump initially nominated Isaacman for the NASA head role in December 2024, but the president abruptly pulled his pick in May due to Isaacman's \"prior associations.\" Although Trump did not specify what those were, some have suggested that it was related to Isaacman's close ties with Musk, with whom Trump had a heated feud over the summer.In November, Trump renominated Isaacman, who was an entrepreneur and became a civilian astronaut after commanding an orbital mission aboard SpaceX's Crew Dragon spacecraft in 2021.Lunar opportunities include establishing space data centers and infrastructure, as well as potentially mining Helium-3, a rare gas embedded in the moon's surface that could become a major fuel for fusion power, Isaacman said. He added that after building a \"moon base,\" NASA will look into making investments in nuclear power and space nuclear propulsion to further exploration.NASA is currently working with various contractors including SpaceX, Jeff Bezo's Blue Origin and Boeing, to participate in its Artemis campaign, a moon exploration program that also aims to prepare for Mars missions.The campaign was propelled after Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill Act allocated $9.9 billion to NASA earlier this year.The Artemis II mission, NASA's first test flight with crew aboard the Space Launch System rocket and the Orion spacecraft, is expected to take off in the near future, Isaacman said.The expedition will be followed up with the Artemis III mission, which SpaceX is contracted to build the lunar landing system for.SpaceX and Blue Origin are refining heavy lift launch vehicles with on-orbit cryogenic propeller transfer to become more readily reusable, he added.\"That's what's going to enable us to be able to go to and from the moon affordably, with great frequency, and set up for missions to Mars and beyond,\" Isaacman said.",

The sale values Castrol at $10.1 billion.Energy companies, including India's Reliance Industries and Saudi Arabia's oil behemoth Aramco, as well as private equity firms Apollo Global Management and Lone Star Funds, had all been touted as suitors for BP's Castrol unit in May, according to Bloomberg, citing people familiar with the matter.\"With this, we have now completed or announced over half of our targeted $20bn divestment programme, with proceeds to significantly strengthen bp's balance sheet,\" interim CEO Carol Howle said in a statement.\"The sale marks an important milestone in the ongoing delivery of our reset strategy. We are reducing complexity, focusing the downstream on our leading integrated businesses, and accelerating delivery of our plan.\"BP has the option to sell its remaining 35% stake in Castrol after a two-year lock-up period.Strategy resetThe Castrol majority stake sale comes days on from the oil giant announcing it was appointing a new CEO — it's fourth in six years.Woodside Energy boss Meg O'Neill will take up the role on April 1, replacing Murray Auchincloss, who lasted less than two years in the role.Stephen Isaacs, strategic advisor at Alvine Capital, which holds a position in BP, told CNBC's \"Squawk Box Europe\" last week that while BP has been \"a very poor performer for a long, long time,\" the CEO change could be \"the last piece of the jigsaw\" in getting its house in order.\"I think there'll be further stake sales of different parts of BP\" going forward, Dan Boardman-Weston, CEO at BRI Wealth Management, told CNBC on Wednesday. The shift will see the company \"getting back to their bread and butter of focusing on oil and gas exploration and development.\"The London-listed company has underperformed compared with its peers in recent times, having reported declining annual profits in both 2023 and 2024.BP's shares opened at 1.3% on Wednesday before paring gains slightly to last trade 0.9% higher. Its share price is up around 9% so far this year, following a 15.7% drop in 2024. Pressure on the stock eased in 2025 following a leadership shakeup, a cost-cutting program, and a string of oil discoveries.",

    "body": "The AI market is tipped to splinter in 2026. The last three months of 2025 were a rollercoaster of tech sell-offs and rallies, as circular deals, debt issuances, and high valuations fueled concerns over an AI bubble.Such volatility may be an early sign of how AI investment is set to evolve as investors pay closer attention to who is spending money and who is making it, according to Stephen Yiu, chief investment officer at Blue Whale Growth Fund.Investors, especially retail investors who are exposed to AI through ETFs, typically have not differentiated between companies with a product but no business model, those burning cash to fund AI infrastructure, or those on the receiving end of AI spending, Yiu told CNBC.So far, \"every company seems to be winning,\" but AI is in its early innings, he said. \"It's very important to differentiate\" between different types of companies, which is \"what the market might start to do,\" Yiu added.This illustration taken on April 20, 2018, in Paris shows apps for Google, Amazon, Facebook and Apple, plus the reflection of a binary code displayed on a tablet screen.Lionel Bonaventure | Afp | Getty ImagesHe sees three camps: private companies or startups, listed AI spenders and AI infrastructure firms. The first group, which includes OpenAI and Anthropic, lured $176.5 billion in venture capital in the first three quarters of 2025, per PitchBook data. Meanwhile, Big Tech names such as Amazon, Microsoft and Meta are the ones cutting checks to AI infrastructure providers such as Nvidia and Broadcom.  Blue Whale Growth Fund measures a company's free cash flow yield, which is the amount of money a company generates after capital expenditure, against its stock price, to figure out whether valuations are justified.  Most companies within the Magnificent 7 are \"trading a significant premium\" since they started heavily investing in AI, Yiu said.\"When I'm looking at valuations in AI, I would not want to position — even though I believe in how AI is going to change the world — into the AI spenders,\" he added, adding that his firm would rather be \"on the receiving end\" as AI spending is set to further impact company finances.  The AI \"froth\" is \"concentrated in specific segments rather than across the broader market,\" Julien Lafargue, chief market strategist at Barclays Private Bank and Wealth Management, told CNBC. The bigger risk lies with companies that are securing investment from the AI bull run but are yet to generate earnings — \"for example, some quantum computing-related companies,\" Lafargue said. \"In these cases, investor positioning seems driven more by optimism than by tangible results,\" he added, saying that \"differentiation is key.\"Read moreThe need for differentiation also reflects an evolution of Big Tech business models. Once asset-light firms are increasingly asset-heavy as they gobble up technology, power and land needed for their bullish AI strategies. Companies like Meta and Google have morphed into hyperscalers that invest heavily in GPUs, data centers, and AI-driven products, which changes their risk profile and business model.Dorian Carrell, Schroders' head of multi-asset income, said valuing these companies like software and capex-light plays may no longer make sense — especially as companies are still figuring out how to fund their AI plans.\"We're not saying it's not going to work, we're not saying it's not going to come through in the next few years, but we are saying, should you pay such a high multiple with such high growth expectations baked in,\" Carrell told CNBC's \"Squawk Box Europe\" on Dec. 1.Tech turned to the debt markets to fund AI infrastructure this year, though investors were cautious about a reliance on debt. While Meta and Amazon have raised funds this way, \"they're still net cash positioned,\" Quilter Cheviot's global head of technology research and investment strategist Ben Barringer told CNBC's \"Europe Early Edition\" on Nov. 20 — an important distinction from companies whose balance sheets may be tighter.The private debt markets \"will be very interesting next year,\" Carrell added. If incremental AI revenues don't outpace those expenses, margins will compress and investors will question their return on investment, Yiu said. In addition, the performance gaps between companies could widen further as hardware and infrastructure depreciate. AI spenders will need to factor into their investments, Yiu added. \"It's not part of the P&L yet. Next year onwards, gradually, it will confound the numbers.\" \"So, there's going to be more and more differentiation.\" ",

    "body": "Mixmike | E+ | Getty ImagesMany student loan borrowers have hit a repayment obstacle: the U.S. Department of Education denied their application to switch into a new payment plan.The department rejected 327,955 borrower requests to be enrolled in an income-driven repayment plan in August alone, according to a Dec. 15 court filing. The denials mean many of these borrowers may remain stuck in their prior repayment plan with a higher monthly payment, or in an interest-accruing forbearance. As of the end of November, another 802,730 IDR plan applications remain pending with the Education Department. Millions of student loan holders rely on IDR plans to afford their payments and eventually, to emerge from their debt. The plans cap borrowers' monthly bills at a share of their discretionary income, and lead to debt cancellation after a certain period, typically 20 years or 25 years. Those pursuing the popular Public Service Loan Forgiveness program, which leads to debt erasure for public servants after a decade, also typically need to be enrolled in an IDR plan. Consumer advocates said they were alarmed by the number of denials.\"This could cause further delays — losing out on qualifying months for Public Service Loan Forgiveness and IDR cancellation — and many of these borrowers will wind up paying a higher amount each month,\" said Persis Yu, deputy executive director and managing counsel at Protect Borrowers. More than 42 million Americans hold student loans, and the outstanding debt exceeds $1.6 trillion.The Education Department did not respond to a request for comment.

The teacher's union, which represents nearly 2 million members, filed a lawsuit against the administration in March, accusing it of depriving student loan borrowers of their rights. Protect Borrowers served as AFT's legal counsel.Here's what to know about the recent IDR plan application denials — and what to do next if it happened to you. Why some IDR applications were rejected The Education Department said in the court filing that it rejected the hundreds of thousands of IDR applications because of an \"unforeseen ambiguity\" about which repayment plan the borrowers should have been enrolled in.  These federal student loan holders had requested to be put in the plan with \"the lowest monthly payment,\" according to the filing. But Trump officials said two plans result in an equal monthly bill. \"In response, ED opted to procedurally deny such applications,\" the agency said in the court document.Yu said the Trump administration's reasoning did not follow established guidelines. \"The IDR application anticipated two possible repayment plans with equal payment amounts and provided a plan for such a case,\" Yu said. In these situations, there is a ranking of IDR plans the Education Department is supposed to follow, she added. Higher education expert Mark Kantrowitz also said he questioned the Trump officials' explanation. \"The U.S. Department of Education's justification for rejecting these borrowers is weak,\" Kantrowitz said. What borrowers should do next The difficulty accessing an affordable student loan repayment plan comes at an already trying time for borrowers. More than 5 million student loan holders are currently in default, and that total could swell to roughly 10 million borrowers soon, the Education Department said earlier this year.The Education Department confirmed to CNBC on Tuesday that it will begin garnishing the wages of borrowers in default on student loans in early January. The U.S. Department of Education's justification for rejecting these borrowers is weak.Mark Kantrowitz higher education expertIf your application for an IDR plan was rejected, file a new request as soon as possible, said Kantrowitz.Borrowers should select a specific plan on their application, \"partly because the borrower should make an informed decision,\" Kantrowitz said, and also because of the recent denials related to ambiguity over which plan has the lowest monthly payment. The Biden administration's Saving on a Valuable Education, or SAVE, plan is now defunct, after a court blocked the program. And President Donald Trump's \"big beautiful bill\" phases out some other IDR plans.As a result, the best current option for many borrowers is the Income-Based Repayment plan, or IBR, Kantrowitz said. Under the terms of IBR, borrowers pay 10% of their discretionary income each month — though that share rises to 15% for certain borrowers with older loans.There are several tools available online to help you determine how much your monthly bill would be under different plans.You can submit a request for an IDR plan at StudentAid.gov.",

Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, confer during the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies hearing titled Fiscal Year 2022 Budget Request for The Environmental Protection Agency, in Dirksen Building on Wednesday, June 9, 2021. Tom Williams | Cq-roll Call, Inc. | Getty ImagesThe Department of Justice on Wednesday said more than one million additional documents potentially related to the disgraced sex offender Jeffrey Epstein have been discovered, slowing the release of the files that supposed to be made public by last Friday.\"The US Attorney for the Southern District of New York and the FBI have informed the Department of Justice that they have uncovered over a million more documents potentially related to the Jeffrey Epstein case,\" the DOJ said in a post on X.\"We have lawyers working around the clock to review and make the legally required redactions to protect victims, and we will release the documents as soon as possible. Due to the mass volume of material, this process may take a few more weeks,\" the post continued.The Christmas Eve announcement drew pushback from lawmakers who had already been critical of the DOJ's handling of the Epstein files.Rep. Robert Garcia, the top Democrat on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, which is conducting its own investigation into Epstein, in a statement accused the White House of engaging \"in a cover-up protecting Epstein's co-conspirators and the powerful men who abused women and girls.\"\"It's outrageous that the DOJ has illegally withheld over 1 million documents from the public,\" said Garcia, who also called on Attorney General Pam Bondi to testify before Congress.The announcement came the same day a bipartisan group of Senators called for an audit of the DOJ's handling of the Epstein files.In a letter to DOJ Acting Inspector General Don Berthiaume, a group of 12 senators said the DOJ had violated a law -- dubbed the Epstein Files Transparency Act -- that passed Congress and was signed by President Donald Trump in November. The law mandated a full release of the Epstein files with minimal redactions by Dec. 19.The lawmakers -- led by Sens. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, and Jeff Merkley, D-Ore. -- said the DOJ has withheld files, released documents already publicly available and redacted certain releases to the extent that \"there are serious questions as to whether the Department is properly applying the limited exceptions for redaction that are permitted under the Act.\"Read more CNBC politics coverageEuropean Union approves over $105 billion toward Ukraine aid package for next two yearsBrown and MIT prof shooter suspect Neves Valente is found dead, authorities saysTrump Media to merge with fusion company TAE Technologies, DJT stock soarsTrump announces 'warrior dividend' of $1,776 to U.S. soldiers in prime-time speechEpstein accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell petitions to vacate sex crime convictionCongressional stock trading ban bill to get a vote in new year: House RepublicansFBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino is stepping down in JanuaryObamacare subsidies extension to get vote after 4 Republicans buck leadershipFCC chief Carr tells Senate that his agency is 'not formally ... independent'Trump vowed to block tankers carrying Venezuela's oil — nearly a dozen at sea nowKennedy Center to be renamed 'Trump-Kennedy Center,' White House saysTrump vowed to block tankers carrying Venezuela's oil — nearly a dozen at sea nowHouse passes bill to ease permits for building out AI infrastructureTrump sues BBC for $10 billion, claims defamation from Panorama documentaryPentagon takes big stake in new Korea Zinc refinery in Tenn., gets 10% of companyNew Trump tariffs collection hits $200 billion, Customs saysFormer Instacart employee says she was fired over her Democratic congressional campaignUkraine peace talks progressing, Russia open to EU membership, U.S. officials sayNew York AG sues UPS for allegedly shorting Christmas season workers' wagesTrump admin to hire 1,000 specialists for 'Tech Force'Trump doubles down on Rob Reiner criticism after killing; director's son in custodyTSA is giving airline passenger data to ICE for deportation push: NYTTrump's AI order may be 'illegal,' Democrats and consumer advocacy groups claimTrump sued by preservation group seeking to halt White House ballroom projectTrump says 'no big deal' after new Epstein photos showing him releasedPutin can fund war for years, ex-official says as Trump's resolve is testedIndiana redistricting bill that Trump demanded defeated in state SenateHouse passes INVEST Act to ease investment standards, boost capital in marketsDOJ fails again to indict New York AG James, a Trump target: ReportsTrump 'sells out' U.S. national security with Nvidia chip sales to China: WarrenTrump pushes for top prosecutor nominee Halligan after Comey, James cases tossedTrump willing to seize more oil tankers off Venezuela coast: White HouseSeized tanker will go to U.S. port, Trump admin intends 'to seize the oil'GOP lawmakers seek Trump aid for agricultural equipment after tariff pressureTrump says Fed could have 'at least doubled' latest interest rate cut'Spoof' ship: Seized oil tanker hid location, visited Iran and VenezuelaTrump admin touts pulling 9,500 truckers off road for failing English testsSwiss government says new 15% U.S. tariff ceiling retroactive to mid-NovemberHomeland Security Dept. buying Boeing 737s for ICE deportationsTrump officials move to end student loan payment pause for millions of borrowersJudge unseals Ghislaine Maxwell grand jury materials, citing Epstein files actUkraine at 'critical moment' in war as European allies ramp up pressure on RussiaDemocrats establish AI working group as industry bolsters DC presenceEx-Trump lawyer Habba resigns as NJ U.S. attorney after disqualification\"Given the Administration's historic hostility to releasing the files, politicization of the Epstein case more broadly, and failure to comply with the Epstein Files Transparency Act, a neutral assessment of its compliance with the statutory disclosure requirements is essential,\" the group wrote.Inspectors general are independent watchdogs that conduct audits and investigations of federal agencies. The DOJ inspector general is \"ideally placed\" to conduct an audit because he has full access to the files, the lawmakers wrote.At the beginning of his second term, Trump fired more than a dozen inspectors general across the federal government but spared longtime DOJ watchdog Michael Horowitz, who had been in the role since 2012. Horowitz left the post in June to take on the same role at the Federal Reserve.Trump tapped Berthiaume to become the DOJ's internal watchdog in October.The DOJ has released two major batches of Epstein files since Dec. 19, but the slow trickle of documents has angered lawmakers on both sides of the aisle. In a letter to Congress on Friday, Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche told lawmakers the DOJ would release the files on a \"rolling basis\" through the end of the year, defying the law's requirement. Now it appears the release will continue into the new year.\"A Christmas Eve news dump of 'a million more files' only proves what we already know: Trump is engaged in a massive coverup. The question Americans deserve answered is simple: WHAT are they hiding—and WHY?\" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said in a post to X on Wednesday.Schumer vowed earlier this week to force the Senate to vote on suing the DOJ for the full release of files. And Reps. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., and Ro Khanna, D-Calif., have threatened to hold Bondi and Blanche in inherent contempt.\"The survivors deserve justice. The DOJ release does not comply with the Epstein Files Transparency Act and does not provide what the survivors are guaranteed under the new law,\" Massie said in a post to X on Monday.Trump, a former friend of Epstein's, was largely absent from the DOJ's initial release of documents last Friday. The latest batch of files, released Tuesday, include many references to Trump, including an email that suggests Trump traveled often on Epstein's private plane in the 1990s.Trump has denied any wrongdoing associated with the disgraced New York financier. On Tuesday, the DOJ said in a post on X that \"some of these documents contain untrue and sensationalist claims made against President Trump that were submitted to the FBI right before the 2020 election.\"During his 2024 presidential campaign, Trump suggested he was open to declassifying some Epstein files, but has fought for much of this year to keep them under wraps. He has referred to the uproar over the Epstein files as a \"hoax\" and pressured some House Republican to drop their support for the legislation that would eventually compel their release. As the Epstein Files Transparency Act seemed poised to advance out of Congress, Trump belatedly gave his blessing to the effort. \"Full transparency—as called for bravely and repeatedly by survivors—is essential in identifying members of our society who enabled and participated in Epstein's crimes. Survivors deserve full disclosure,\" the lawmakers wrote. Murkowski was the lone Republican to sign the letter, though the Epstein Files Transparency Act passed both chambers with broad bipartisan support.",

    "body": "European leaders on Wednesday condemned a move by the U.S. to ban visas for five individuals — including a former EU commissioner — for alleged censorship.The Trump administration imposed visa bans on Thierry Breton, a former European Union commissioner behind the Digital Services Act (DSA), and four anti-disinformation campaigners, accusing them of censoring U.S. social media platforms.\"The State Department is taking decisive action against five individuals who have led organized efforts to coerce American platforms to censor, demonetize, and suppress American viewpoints they oppose,\" Secretary of State Marco Rubio said in a statement.The DSA forces tech giants like Google and Meta to police illegal content more aggressively, or face hefty fines.Rubio added that \"these radical activists and weaponized NGOs have advanced censorship crackdowns by foreign states—in each case targeting American speakers and American companies.\" As such, their entry to the U.S. has \"potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences,\" he said. \"Based on these determinations, the Department has taken steps to impose visa restrictions on agents of the global censorship-industrial complex who, as a result, will be generally barred from entering the United States.\" Breton, who served as EU commissioner between 2019 and 2024, wrote on X: \"Is McCarthy's witch hunt back?\"He added: \"As a reminder: 90% of the European Parliament — our democratically elected body — and all 27 Member States unanimously voted the DSA.\" \"To our American friends: \"Censorship isn't where you think it is.\"\" 'Witch hunt'The European Commission \"strongly condemned\" the move on Wednesday. \"Freedom of expression is a fundamental right in Europe and a shared core value with the United States across the democratic world,\" it said in a statement, adding that \"the EU is an open, rules-based single market, with the sovereign right to regulate economic activity in line with our democratic values and international commitments.\"\"Our digital rules ensure a safe, fair, and level playing field for all companies, applied fairly and without discrimination.\" The Commission has asked for clarifications from U.S. authorities, it said. \"Freedom of speech is the foundation of our strong and vibrant European democracy,\" said current EU chief Ursula von der Leyen on X. \"We are proud of it. We will protect it.\"French President Emmanuel Macron said that his country condemns the visa restrictions. \"These measures amount to intimidation and coercion aimed at undermining European digital sovereignty,\" he said in a statement on X. watch now\"The European Union's digital regulations were adopted following a democratic and sovereign process by the European Parliament and the Council.\"He also said that the DSA does not target any specific third country but is designed \"to ensure that what is illegal offline is also illegal online.\"It comes as President Donald Trump continues to ramp up travel restrictions for foreign visitors and criticizes Europe. Rubio did not identify who his department had taken action against, however Under Secretary for Public Diplomacy Sarah Rogers later did so on X. Josephine Ballon, the co-leader of HateAid who serves on Germany's Advisory Council of the Digital Services, was among those working on anti-disinformation campaigns to receive sanctions. Her co-leader Anna-Lena von Hodenberg was also affected. CNBC has reached out to Ballon and Von Hodenberg for comment.The bans are part of efforts to enforce what Rogers refers to as a \"red line\" for the U.S. and the \"extraterritorial censorship of Americans.\" In an interview with GB news on Dec. 4, Rogers took aim at the U.K.'s Online Safety Act (OSA), saying the law was being applied extraterritorially, accounting for U.S. citizens' speech about U.S. politics on U.S.-based platforms.Europe's DSA and the U.K.'s OSA are among only a handful of pieces of legislation designed to keep the power of Big Tech in check and improve safety for children online. OSA law requires age verification on adult sites and a number of other platforms.",

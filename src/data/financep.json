    "body": "File: President Donald Trump looks on after signing an executive order in the Oval Office of the White House on April 9, 2025.Saul Loeb | Afp | Getty ImagesA company controlled by a Chinese national was ordered by U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday to unwind a $2.9 million acquisition of chip assets from a U.S. manufacturer, citing national security concerns.The White House said in an executive order that HieFo Corporation, incorporated in Delaware, was \"controlled by a citizen of the People's Republic of China.\"HieFo acquired the digital chips and related wafer design, fabrication, and processing businesses of New Jersey-based Emcore on April 30, 2024, which included a semiconductor manufacturing facility, the Treasury Department said in a separate statement.The potential diversion of the supply of indium phosphide chips manufactured by Emcore's digital chips business away from the U.S. was also identified as a national security risk, the Treasury Department added.HieFo and Emcore did not immediately respond to a CNBC request for comment.The Global Times, a Chinese government mouthpiece, citing an expert, said the divestment order \"reflects Washington's anxiety over technology competition with China\" as it was made without a convincing rationale.The Treasury Department said the deal was not notified to the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, known as CFIUS, prompting a review by its non-notified transactions team.\"CFIUS identified a national security risk arising from the transaction relating to potential access to EMCORE's intellectual property, proprietary know-how, and expertise,\" the Treasury Department said.HieFo was ordered to divest all acquired assets within 180 days and to immediately restrict access to Emcore's technical information.In a statement dated Sept. 2, 2024, HieFo said the deal would allow operations to continue at Emcore's facility in Alhambra, California, and that it had \"successfully engaged\" nearly all key scientists, engineers and operational staff.HieFo was founded by Genzao Zhang and Harry Moore through a management buyout of wafer fabrication and chip-related assets from Emcore. Both founders list their start dates at HieFo as May 2024 on LinkedIn, when the acquisition closed.The company claimed it had inherited more than 40 years of optoelectronic innovation in indium phosphide chip manufacturing.Emcore manufactures navigation equipment such as gyroscopes and sensors used in commercial, industrial and defense applications, including autonomous navigation and weapons systems, according to its website.The company was delisted from Nasdaq in early 2025 following its merger with aerospace manufacturing holding company Velocity One LP in November 2024.",

    "body": "A pedestrian passes in front of the Saks Fifth Avenue at Brookfield Place in New York.Allison Joyce | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesSaks Global named a new CEO on Friday as the retailer is reportedly on the cusp of filing for bankruptcy protection.The parent of high-end department store chain Saks Fifth Avenue, which is privately held, will now be led by Richard Baker, the company's executive chairman, Saks said in a news release. He will continue to hold the executive chairman role.With the shake-up, three-decade long Saks executive Marc Metrick will leave the company. The news release said Metrick's is departing \"to pursue new opportunities.\"In a statement, Baker said he will work \"to secure a strong and stable future for our company.\"\"Across Saks Global, with our deep industry expertise, well-established relationships within the luxury sector, and talented employees, we will strengthen our position so that we can capitalize on the many opportunities we see for our company in the luxury market,\" he said.Saks is preparing to file for bankruptcy after missing a debt payment related to its 2024 acquisition of department store chain Neiman Marcus, the Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday, citing people familiar with the matter.It's the latest twist in the luxury department store operator's effort to regain its financial footing. Saks Global was created in 2024 after Saks Fifth Avenue parent company Hudson's Bay Co. acquired Neiman Marcus for $2.65 billion. By marrying the two luxury chains, it sought to better compete with other retailers and department stores including Nordstrom and Macy's-owned Bloomingdale's.The deal turned Saks Global into a larger player, which included Saks Fifth Avenue, its off-price chain Saks Off 5th, Neiman Marcus' namesake department store chain and Bergdorf Goodman. Yet the company has taken clear steps to raise cash and shore up its finances, including the recent sale of Neiman Marcus' Beverly Hills flagship and Saks Global's debt restructuring in August 2025.In his biography on Saks Global's website, the company credited Baker for leading the acquisition of Neiman Marcus and described his strong real estate background. Baker is an owner of National Realty & Development Corp., one of the largest real estate development companies in the United States, and he previously served as the chairman of the board of directors for Retail Opportunity Investments Corp., which he also converted into a real estate investment trust listed on the Nasdaq.

Citadel's fundamental equity strategy returned 14.5%, while its global fixed income fund advanced 9.4%.Citadel declined to comment. The S&P 500 locked in a 16.4% gain for the year, its third straight double-digit annual advance. That marks an impressive recovery from the rout seen in early April following President Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs announcement. At one point, the S&P 500 was even on the cusp of closing in bear market territory.The hedge fund plans to return about $5 billion of profits earned this year to clients in an effort to limit capital growth, CNBC's Leslie Picker previously reported. The move is expected to reduce assets under management to about $67 billion from roughly $72 billion.Wellington's long-term track record remains strong as the fund has generated an annualized return of 19% since its inception in 1990, the person said.",

    "body": "If your portfolio is invested in exchange-traded funds, you may have had a very good 2025. The S&P 500 — the index tracked by the three largest ETFs on the market, per ETF Database – returned about 16% in 2025.But in theory, depending on which funds you held, you could have done quite a bit better. The MicroSectors Gold Miners 3X Leveraged ETN, a fund which tracks the price of a privacy-focused cryptocurrency, finished the year up 796% — the best of any U.S. traded ETF, according to data from FactSet analyzed by CNBC. You could have also earned a huge return had you bought other ETFs focused on metal mining or Korean stocks. While it can be fun to fantasize about what your returns could have looked like had you chosen one of last year's big winners, you should think twice before choosing one as a major building block of your investing strategy, says Jeff Ptak, managing director for Morningstar Research Services. \"They should play very little, if any, role in your portfolio,\" he says. \"Most of what you see at the top of these lists is niche, hyper-volatile, gimmicky. These aren't words I would associate with prudent, long-term investing.\"Beware of the big winnersPrudent, long-term investing is generally the name of the game if you're hoping to build wealth, investing experts say. So what makes some of the 2025 winners unsuitable? Leveraged fundsOne common theme on the list is the use of leverage, the practice of buying or selling derivatives to amplify a fund's return. Rather than seeking to track the return of an index, funds with 2X or 3X in the name aim to deliver multiples of that same return. This makes them highly volatile, and likely candidates for year-end best-of — or worst-of — lists, says Roxanna Islam, head of sector and industry research at TMX VettaFi, an investment research firm and index provider.\"I don't think it's surprising to see leverage at the top,\" she says. \"With two or three times [returns] they're most likely going to be in the top at some point.\"The problem with these funds, for long-term investors, is that they aim to produce 200% to 300% of the index's return on a daily basis, resetting for each trading day. In other words, they're for day traders, not investors, says Islam. \"These are basically used as short-term trading instruments. They're intended to be held for one day,\" she says. \"They're not something to hold for a whole year, even though you see a high [2025] return.\"Volatile areas of the marketAnother common theme among winning 2025 ETFs: precious metals mining funds. It's no surprise that some companies that mine for the shiny stuff did well last year. Gold prices spiked by about 65% in 2025 and silver rose by more than 140%. These firms, some of which have more well-established mining operations than others, benefit from rising precious metals prices. While owning precious metals — often as a portfolio diversifier or an inflation hedge — is a common investment strategy, says Ptak, investing in miners is \"a whole other kettle of fish.\"That's because, in addition to fluctuations in metal prices, these firms' stock prices move based on changes to the underlying business, which can be volatile and highly indebted, says Ptak. \"[Mining ETFs] are only slightly less speculative than something that's got 2X or 3X in the name,\" he says. Make smarter movesOverall, when considering adding any high-performing fund to your portfolio, you'd be wise to consider its long-term track record as well as how its objectives fit within your investment strategy, says Islam. It may be wise to do this with the help of a financial professional. And when browsing year-end lists, remember that you're looking for consistent, long-term returns rather than short-term wins, says Islam. \"Past performance does not equal future performance, especially when you're looking at a lot of these smaller themes, smaller ETFs,\" she says. \"A lot of them don't tend to show significant outperformance year after year, the same way holding a broad stock market ETF would.\"Want to give your kids the ultimate advantage?

In a statement published Thursday, BYD said sales of its battery-powered cars rose nearly 28% to 2.26 million units.Musk openly laughed at the mention of BYD while being interviewed on Bloomberg TV in October 2011. He said he did not see the company as a competitor to Tesla, adding: \"I don't think they have a great product.\"Meanwhile, Tesla said Friday it delivered 1.64 million vehicles in 2025, in line with a company-compiled estimate of 1.6 million vehicle deliveries. The annual figure is roughly an 8% drop from 2024, the company's second straight annual drop. Deliveries for Q4 2025 were about 16% lower than the fourth quarter of 2024, when Musk's EV company reported 495,570 deliveries. Deliveries are the closest approximation of sales reported by Tesla, but are not precisely defined in the company's shareholder communications.

The company saw shares collapse in the first quarter of 2025 amid stiff competition, particularly from Chinese EV manufacturers, and reputational fallout from Musk's incendiary political rhetoric.The stock price has come roaring back in recent weeks, however, notching an all-time closing high of $489.88 last month, after Musk said the company had been testing driverless vehicles in Austin, Texas, with no occupants on board, almost six months after launching a pilot program with safety drivers. — CNBC's Lora Kolodny contributed to this report.",

    "body": "U.S. President Donald Trump gestures during a press conference following a U.S. strike on Venezuela where President Nicolas Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, were captured, from Trump's Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Florida, U.S., January 3, 2026. Jonathan Ernst | ReutersThe Trump administration is facing renewed questions over its recent pardon of former Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernandez after the U.S. captured Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro on Saturday and charged him with crimes related to drug trafficking.  Hernandez in 2024 was convicted of conspiring with drug traffickers and using his government position to help hundreds of tons of cocaine enter the United States. He was sentenced to 45 years in prison. President Donald Trump pardoned Hernandez in November, saying in a post to his Truth Social account that he had been \"treated very harshly and unfairly.\" Maduro was charged with narco-terrorism conspiracy, along with four other charges: cocaine importation conspiracy; possession of machine guns and destructive devices; and conspiracy to possess machine guns and destructive devices.Secretary of State Marco Rubio on Sunday was pressed on the apparent contradiction of Hernandez' pardon now that the U.S. is seeking similar charges against Maduro, another head of state of a South American nation with ties to the drug trade. \"I don't do the pardon file, I'm not against it or for it, I didn't review the file, so I can't speak to you about the dynamics that led the president to make the decision that he made,\" Rubio said on NBC's \"Meet the Press.\" \"He reviewed the file, he went through the arguments in it and he felt that the former president of Honduras was treated very unfairly by the previous administration,\" Rubio said. Rubio said that \"whether you agree with that decision or not ... that doesn't mean you leave Maduro in place.\"\"The answer to that, whether you have a problem with it or not, is not to leave in play someone who has been indicted who hasn't even faced American justice yet,\" Rubio said. Trump's pardon of Hernandez was already under intense scrutiny before Maduro's ouster. Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., the ranking member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said in a statement that the \"hypocrisy underlying this decision is especially glaring.\"\"This same president recently pardoned former Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernández, who was convicted in a U.S. court on serious drug trafficking charges, including conspiring with narcotics traffickers while in office,\" Warner said. \"Yet now, the administration claims that similar allegations justify the use of military force against another sovereign nation. You cannot credibly argue that drug trafficking charges demand invasion in one case, while issuing a pardon in another.\"At a press conference on Saturday after Maduro's capture, Trump was pressed on the pardon. He said Hernandez was \"persecuted very unfairly.\" \"He was treated like the Biden administration treated a man named Trump,\" Trump said, referring to his own criminal prosecutions for allegedly hoarding classified documents and attempting to overturn the 2020 election after leaving office following his first term as president. Trump also cited his endorsement of Nasry Asfura, the president-elect of Honduras, as another reason for the pardon. \"He's also a party member of the man who won, so obviously the people liked what I did,\" Trump said. \"And one of the reasons that was done is because of the fact that the party in power felt very strongly that that man was treated very badly.\"Trump also gestured at Rubio and other members of his national security team when explaining why he issued the pardon. \"I went to a lot of the people standing behind me, and they felt that that man was persecuted and treated very badly,\" he said.

Read the indictment here.\"Nicolas Maduro Moros, the defendant, now sits atop a corrupt, illegitimate government that, for decades, has leveraged government power to protect and promote illegal activity, including drug trafficking,\" the indictment said.\"That drug trafficking has enriched and entrenched Venezuela's political and military elite, including Minister of the Interior, Justice and Peace Diosado Cabello Rondon, the defendant, and former  Minister of the Interior and Justice Ramon Rodriguez Chachin, the defendant.\"Guerrero was identified as the leader of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua.In addition to the narco-terrorism conspiracy charge, the indictment alleges four other criminal counts: cocaine importation conspiracy; possession of machine guns and destructive devices; and conspiracy to possess machine guns and destructive devices.Rep.

Clary | Afp | Getty ImagesThe new year is starting off with the stock market looking as split as it did last year. The first trading day of 2026 kicked off Friday, with the stock market as bifurcated as it had been in recent months. Though the S&P 500 started the session higher, carried aloft by semiconductors, it has since sputtered and turned lower as the day wore on. The broad market index was last down by 0.1%. A look inside the S&P 500 shows a major division. Five sectors in the broad market index are higher, led by industrials, energy and utilities that were each higher by more than 1%. Six sectors were lower, led by consumer discretionary and communication services. The day's trading is a continuation of a theme that has gained strength in recent months. While the bull market rally of the last three years has been defined by artificial intelligence, traders, nervous tech stocks will find an uphill climb more difficult in 2026, started rotating into other groups. Indeed, the Nasdaq Composite, known for its heavy exposure toward tech companies, ended last year with two straight months of losses.  Many strategists called for a broadening out of the stock market, with companies more sensitive to the economic cycle taking the mantle from tech to lead the market in 2026. They viewed that as a healthy development to extend the bull market.But that could mean an advance for the overall index is harder to come by. Broadly speaking, according to the 2026 CNBC Market Strategist Survey, Wall Street expects the S&P 500 will climb by roughly 11% in 2026 — a respectable rise that nevertheless falls short of the advance of the last three.Others on the Street are more nervous. On Wednesday, Bank of America strategist Savita Subramanian noted the S&P 500 is expensive, meaning \"risks to the index abound in 2026.\" The strategist's 7,100 year-end target for the S&P 500 is among the lowest of those surveyed. Elsewhere, Adam Parker, founder of Trivariate Research, told CNBC's \"Squawk on the Street\" this past week that the level of optimism on the Street has him nervous for 2026. \"I think the consensus is pretty bullish,\" Parker said. \"You're betting on strong earnings growth, and I don't know if that's as likely.\" Within the tech trade, chip stocks were the lone bright spot. As of midday trading, Nvidia was the only name among the Magnificent Seven companies to rise, up by 1.5%. The VanEck Semiconductor ETF gained nearly 3%. Micron rallied more than 7%, while AMD rose more than 3%. ",

    "body": "Amazon Ireland corporate offices in Dublin, as Amazon.com, Inc., said on Tuesday it plans to cut its global corporate workforce by as many as 14,000 roles and seize the opportunity provided by artificial intelligence (AI), in Dublin, Ireland, Oct. 28, 2025. Damien Eagers | ReutersValuations of several technology and artificial intelligence stocks are expected to remain in focus in 2026, as investors are concerned about the payoffs on massive AI spending.Nonetheless, top Wall Street analysts continue to be bullish on several tech and AI plays based on thorough analysis of their fundamentals, strong execution, and growth potential.Here are three stocks favored by some of Wall Street's top pros, according to TipRanks, a platform that ranks analysts based on their past performance.AmazonThis week's first pick is e-commerce and cloud computing giant Amazon (AMZN). In a research note on the 2026 outlook for stocks in the AI and internet space, RBC Capital analyst Brad Erickson called Amazon one of his favorite ideas, citing \"Best in-class visibility on AI infrastructure ROIC [return on invested capital] with compelling product cycle/capacity acceleration cycle coming.\"Erickson reaffirmed a buy rating on Amazon stock with a price forecast of $300. Interestingly, TipRanks' AI Analyst is also bullish on AMZN stock with an \"outperform\" rating but a lower price target of $240.The top-rated analyst said that he likes the structural positioning of the company's Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud unit for two key reasons. First, Erickson highlighted that AWS has the most diversified and hedged revenue sources, with its core business largely unaffected by generative AI and not a competitor of ChatGPT maker OpenAI. Second, Erickson thinks that AWS is the most disciplined hyperscaler when it comes to capital spending.Notably, based on his ROIC scenario analysis, Erickson expects Amazon to see the fastest returns, with Alphabet-owned Google expanding more gradually, and Meta Platforms lagging in capital efficiency due to its indirect revenue model. He expects AWS to have the highest marginal contribution margin as the cloud unit increases its spending, thanks to its pay-as-you-go model and strong efficiency, with new capacity that is often pre-booked and revenue that is directly linked to infrastructure usage.Based on his optimistic outlook, Erickson raised his revenue and EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) estimates for 2026 and 2027, driven by higher AWS growth expectations and cost efficiencies. For 2028, the analyst expects revenue growth of 10% and an adjusted EBITDA margin of 30%.Erickson ranks No. 195 among more than 10,100 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been successful 58% of the time, delivering an average return of 21.9%. See Amazon Hedge Funds Trading Activity on TipRanks.MicrosoftLet's look at another tech giant, Microsoft (MSFT). Following meetings with the company's executives across businesses, Morgan Stanley analyst Keith Weiss reiterated a buy rating on MSFT stock with a price target of $650. The stock scores an \"outperform\" rating from TipRanks' AI Analyst with a price target of $562.\"Meeting with executives across Microsoft businesses leaves us with conviction on robust demand translating to durable mid-teens top-line growth and increased confidence in ROI contributing to continued operating margin expansion,\" said Weiss.Among the key takeaways from his meetings that he mentioned, Weiss highlighted that demand for Microsoft Azure has been stronger than what the company expected at the start of the year. The analyst added that demand is solid not only for Azure AI but across every product within the Azure portfolio, thanks to broader IT modernization efforts of enterprises.Consequently, Weiss raised his Azure estimates, assuming Azure AI gross margin (excluding OpenAI revenue share) reaches 30% by fiscal 2029. In fact, Weiss thinks that Azure AI margin can exceed 40%, suggesting huge upside to his estimates in the years ahead.Overall, Weiss called MSFT his Top Pick in the large-cap software sector, with the stock trading at 23x his calendar year 2027 GAAP EPS estimate of $20.65. The analyst contends that sustained top-line demand and the possibility for further margin expansion, as reflected in the company's Q1 FY26 results, are not yet fully valued by the market.Weiss ranks No. 400 among more than 10,100 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been profitable 63% of the time, delivering an average return of 12.1%. See Microsoft Technology Ownership Structure on TipRanks.Micron TechnologyMemory and storage solutions provider Micron Technology (MU) impressed investors with market-beating results for the first quarter of fiscal 2026. The company also issued an upbeat outlook for the fiscal second quarter, reflecting strong demand for its high-performance memory and storage products amid the rapid growth in AI data centers.Impressed by the Q1 FY26 print, Stifel analyst Brian Chin reiterated a buy rating on Micron stock with a price target of $300. TipRanks' AI Analyst is also bullish on MU stock, with an \"outperform\" rating and a price target of $285.Discussing the \"blockbuster\" quarterly performance and outlook, Chin observed that Micron easily surpassed Stifel's above-consensus expectations with a higher average selling price (ASP) driving a 20% sequential growth in DRAM and NAND revenue. The 5-star analyst highlighted the robust demand, saying, \"Demand is outstripping supply, with Micron only able to meet 1/2 to 2/3 of some key customers' near term demand.\"Chin also noted the impressive rise in margins across all of Micron's business units, including the consumer-oriented Mobile and Client Business division, which saw its gross margin jump to 54% in Q1 FY26 from 36% in Q4 FY25.The analyst also discussed Micron's solid guidance and added that despite industry supply constraints, Micron expects both DRAM and NAND bit shipments to increase by 20% in 2026. Overall, Chin remains bullish on MU stock and noted that after another round of positive estimate revisions, the stock trades at less than 6x his next-12 months earnings per share estimate.Chin ranks No. 350 among more than 10,100 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been profitable 63% of the time, delivering an average return of 25.6%. See Micron Financials on TipRanks. ",

    "body": "watch nowWarren Buffett said Berkshire Hathaway is better positioned than any company to endure over the long term as he handed over the CEO reins to his successor Greg Abel, whom he strongly endorsed. \"It has a better chance I think of being here 100 years from now than any company I can think of,\" Buffett told Becky Quick in a special interview, parts of which aired on CNBC Friday.The full interview with Buffett will air on CNBC Tuesday, Jan. 13 at 7 p.m. ET.Buffett officially relinquished the CEO role to Abel Thursday, ending a six-decade legendary run at the helm that turned a struggling textile mill into a trillion-dollar conglomerate with varied businesses from insurance companies to railroads with over $300 billion in cash on the balance sheet. \"Greg will be the decider,\" Buffett said. I \"can't imagine how much more he can get accomplished in a week than I can in a month....I'd rather have Greg handling my money than any of the top investment advisors or any of the top CEOs in the United States.\"Berkshire shares trailed the market after Buffett announced in May he was retiring as some investors questioned whether Abel could manage the sprawling collection of businesses, along with an equity portfolio, in a similar fashion as Buffett, while commanding a premium valuation from the market.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconBerkshire B shares, 1 yearBuffett, who will remain chairman, noted that Abel is a sensible leader, who, like him, lives a normal life away from the spotlight.\"He's not a distorted individual. You know, I mean, he likes to play ice hockey with his kids,\" he said. \"If the neighbors didn't know who he was, they wouldn't have any idea that on Jan. 1, he's going to be the decider on a company that employs close to 400,000 people, and has got plans to be around 50 or 100 years from now.\"The 95-year-old investor also signaled a quieter public role going forward, saying he will not take the stage at Berkshire's annual shareholder meeting this year, a notable shift from a tradition that has drawn tens of thousands of investors to Omaha for decades.\"Everything will be the same,\" Buffett said. \"I will come in. I won't be up there speaking at the annual meeting, but I'll be in the directors' section.\"",

    "body": "U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell holds a press conference following a two-day meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee at the U.S. Federal Reserve in Washington, Dec. 10, 2025.Kevin Lamarque | ReutersThe Federal Reserve heads into 2026 facing a slew of political and policy challenges, headlined by a new chair and an economy fed by both tailwinds and headwinds that will make policymakers' choices all the more important.Coming off three consecutive interest rate cuts, the central bank is expected to follow a more tepid path for the year ahead in which additional cuts could be hard to come by considering expectations for solid growth and ongoing inflation pressures.One thing does seem certain: After a year of extraordinary upheaval surrounding the Fed, 2026 looks to offer more of the same.\"I do think there'll be a big spotlight. There'll be lots of intrigue,\" said Kathy Bostjancic, chief economist at Nationwide. \"There's still a lot of uncertainty that keeps the Fed in the spotlight, and probably in the hot seat too.\"The previous year saw the Fed come under that spotlight in ways that it never had before.As he started his second term at the White House, President Donald Trump repeatedly threatened to fire Fed Chair Jerome Powell for not being quicker to push for interest rate cuts. Around mid-year, the Fed came under fire again, this time for cost overruns at a renovation project it had undertaken at its Washington headquarters.In between, Trump tried to remove Governor Lisa Cook over allegations — as yet unproven and not even brought as formal charges — that she committed mortgage fraud. That all came against a backdrop of who would succeed Powell as chair when his term expires in May, with as many as 11 candidates considered during an interview process led by Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. If all that sounds exhausting, consider that 2026 begins with a Supreme Court hearing scheduled for Jan. 21 to decide whether Trump has the authority to remove Cook. A week later, the Federal Open Market Committee holds its interest rate vote. At some point during the month, Trump is expected to unveil his choice for Fed chair. And Powell, cagey on the issue so far, also will have to disclose whether he plans on serving out his term on the Board of Governors that runs until January 2028.There also have been multiple dissents at recent rate votes, and new regional presidents set to come on board at the FOMC have a hawkish bent, meaning they're likely to resist additional cuts.\"It's still a tough spot for the Fed,\" Bostjancic said.Focus on policyStill, when it comes to policy, most on Wall Street expect the Fed to put the noise in the background and continue down the road of lowering its benchmark interest rate just a bit more until it gets closer to a neutral level around 3%. Neutral is considered a spot that neither boosts nor holds back economic activity, and the funds rate is just half a percentage point above where most on the FOMC see the rate landing over the long term.\"Chair Powell helped orchestrate three 25-basis-point rate cuts in a row. It's not as if he was standing in the way of the FOMC cutting rates,\" Bostjancic said. As far as further cuts go, \"For us, it's [about] the economic data.\"Bostjancic sees the data pointing to two cuts this year, one around mid-year and another toward the end. The Fed's \"dot plot\" grid of expectations indicates just one cut, while outliers such as Moody's Analytics chief economist Mark Zandi and Citigroup seeing labor market weakness pointing to three.Powell and his colleagues have stood by the notion that they won't be bullied into cuts and indeed will be guided by data.Torsten Slok, chief economist at Apollo Global Management, thinks the economy will be too strong for the Fed to cut much more, seeing just one reduction ahead.\"The issue is that the winds are really changing for the U.S. economy,\" Slok said during a CNBC interview Friday.Whereas 2025 saw headwinds of tariffs, inflation and a general air of uncertainty, fiscal stimulus and a stabilizing labor market will be pushing on growth, he said.\"It is, in my view, looking like more that the tailwinds are beginning to accumulate and making it more difficult for the Fed to cut rates this year,\" Slok added.The role of AIOne wildcard will be the role that artificial intelligence plays on economic growth.Seen as both a productivity enhancer and a potential impediment to hiring, assessing the impact AI is having on the economy will be paramount for the Fed, said Joseph Brusuelas, chief economist at RSM.\"The Fed this year has got a real challenge in terms of communicating their strategy,\" Brusuelas said. \"We have this massive investment flowing into very sophisticated technologies, and the Federal Reserve is going to need to communicate their basic view on what this means.\"After sputtering at the beginning of 2026, the economy grew rapidly in the middle two quarters and is on pace to accelerate at a 3% pace in the fourth quarter, according to preliminary data from the Atlanta Fed.In addition to helping push along the broader economy, AI-related stocks were a key highlight of another stellar year on Wall Street that saw major averages post double-digit increases.Calibrating monetary policy in that kind of environment will be tough, Brusuelas said.\"They're going to need to provide strategic direction for the central bank at a time when the economy is clearly pivoting towards the integration of this sophisticated technology in the production of goods and provision of services,\" he said. \"This is a really big potential pivot around policy that needs to happen.\"",

While the scale of the U.S. attack was unexpected, markets had already priced in a conflict with Venezuela that would disrupt oil exports, said Arne Lohmann Rasmussen, chief analyst and head of research at A/S Global Risk Management.Venezuela, a founding member of OPEC, has the largest proven oil reserves in the world. But the South American nation currently produces less than a million oil barrels a day, which is less than 1% of global oil production, according to Rasmussen. It exports just about half its production, or some 500,000 barrels, Rasmussen said. The conflict also comes as the global oil market is oversupplied and demand is relatively weak, a pattern that is customary in the first quarter of the year, he said.Rasmussen estimated that Brent crude prices will only rise by about $1 to $2, or even less, when futures trading opens on Sunday night. He projected that Brent will edge lower next week than where it closed on Friday, which was $60.75.\"Despite this being a huge geopolitical event that you would normally expect to be positive or push up oil prices,\" he said, \"the bottom line is there's still too much oil in the market, and that's why oil prices will not go ballistic.\"Analyst Bob McNally of Rapidan Energy said he was advising clients before the weekend that about a third of Venezuela's oil production was at risk. While he does not predict that all of Venezuela's output would be cut off, he told CNBC that it would not pose a meaningful risk to oil markets in the short term. The oil market in 2025 posted its biggest annual decline in five years. The global benchmark Brent fell about 19% last year, while U.S. crude oil lost nearly 20%.The market has been under pressure as OPEC+ ramped up production after years of output cuts. The U.S. also produced at a record level of just over 13.8 million barrels per day.Oil prices may decline further as the regime overthrow raises the possibility of eventually boosting oil production in Venezuela, analysts told CNBC. Saul Kavonic, head of energy research at MST Financial, estimated that exports could approach 3 million barrels in the medium term if a new Venezuelan government led to the lifting of sanctions and the return of foreign investors. \"If anything, the future of Venezuela will have a bearish impact on the market, because there's really nowhere to go but up,\" said energy industry consultant David Goldwyn, a former top State Department energy official in the Obama administration.Currently, the embargo on Venezuelan oil is still in effect, Trump said during a press conference Saturday. He also said that U.S. oil companies will invest billions of dollars to rebuild Venezuela's energy sector. Trump did not provide details on which companies would invest or how, nor did he clarify how the U.S. would temporarily run Venezuela \"with a group.\"Goldwyn said it is hard to predict whether U.S. oil companies will invest, given the uncertainty about the interim and future governments in Venezuela. \"Everything we have learned about government transitions from Iraq, from Afghanistan, from other countries, is that transitions are hard,\" he said. \"No company is going to want to commit to invest billions of dollars for a long-term operation until they know what the terms are. And they can't know what the terms are until you know what the government is going to be.\"Goldwyn added that companies, including Exxon Mobil, are still waiting to collect on debt owed by Venezuela's national oil company, Petróleos de Venezuela S.A. (PDVSA). Rapidan Energy's McNally said it is a complicated proposition for U.S. oil companies. Oil producers have not forgotten being kicked out of Venezuela in the early 2000s, when the country expropriated the assets of foreign oil companies, he said. That said, accessing the world's largest oil reserves would be \"tantalizing\" to U.S. oil companies if sanctions were lifted, he added.But it would take decades of investment and billions of dollars, McNally said. Whether it's worth it comes down to one central question, he said: Does the world need that much oil?\"Until late last year, the market consensus had been that demand for oil is going to stop growing in four years. It's over because of EVs and fuel efficiency policies and climate change policies,\" McNally said.But as the U.S. and other nations, including China and Canada, weaken their climate policies and sales of electric vehicles fall, the prospect of investing in Venezuela has become much more attractive. \"All of a sudden you're starting to say: \"Whoa, we're going to need more oil,\" he said. — Additional reporting contributed by CNBC's Victor Loh",

    "body": "As news spread Saturday of President Donald Trump's removal of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, a split screen emerged in Congress: Republicans largely celebrated the military operation, while Democrats condemned the president's actions and questioned their legality. After months of pressure on Maduro, Trump announced on Truth Social that the U.S. had assisted in a \"large scale strike\" against the country and its leader, who was captured along with his wife, Cilia Flores, and is being brought to the U.S. \"Trump rejected our Constitutionally required approval process for armed conflict because the Administration knows the American people overwhelmingly reject risks pulling our nation into another war,\" Sen. Andy Kim, D-N.J., said in a post to X on Saturday.The Constitution grants Congress primary authority to declare war. The War Powers Resolution, passed in 1973 in response to the Vietnam War, limits the president's ability to take military action unilaterally and requires the president to consult with Congress when troops are deployed.But lawmakers said the president did not seek approval and did not brief Congress on his plans.Trump is expected to meet with House Republicans on Tuesday at the Kennedy Center, MS NOW reported, citing two sources. Trump will reportedly make an appearance at the gathering and it is unclear how long he will stay, MS Now reported.The lawmakers had already been scheduled to meet at the center for a policy forum to discuss the agenda for the second half of the 119th Congress, according to an invitation obtained by MS NOW. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., in a statement, called the decision to take military action in Venezuela without congressional authorization \"reckless.\"\"The administration has assured me three separate times that it was not pursuing regime change or taking military action in Venezuela. Clearly, they are not being straight with Americans,\" Schumer said.Rep. Gregory Meeks, D-N.Y., the ranking member on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, told MSNOW that he had \"no briefing or heads up. I received all information from the news media at this point.\" And Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., who sits on the Senate Armed Services Committee, was among those who cheered the capture of Maduro, but said Congress had not been given any forewarning.\"And that's probably one reason why it didn't leak over these four days,\" Cotton said, in an interview on \"Fox & Friends\" on Saturday. \"Congress isn't notified when the FBI is going to arrest a drug trafficker or cyber criminal here in the United States. Nor should Congress be notified when the executive branch is executing arrests on indicted persons.\"Attorney General Pam Bondi on Saturday said in a post on X that Maduro and his wife have been indicted in the Southern District of New York.They have been charged with conspiracy to commit narco-terrorism, cocaine importation conspiracy, possession of weapons and destructive devices, and conspiracy to possess machineguns and destructive devices against the U.S., according to Bondi's post.Trump seemed to shrug off concerns about the constitutionality of the attack during a call-in to \"Fox & Friends.\"\"The Democrats, maybe they'll take a shot... all they do is complain,\" Trump said. \"They should say, 'great job.' They shouldn't say, 'Oh gee, maybe it's not constitutional.' You know, the same old stuff that we've been hearing for years and years and years.\" The president also said that the attack originally had been planned for earlier in the week but was rescheduled due to weather. No U.S. soldiers were killed in the operation, he said.During a press conference at Mar-a-Lago on Saturday, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said members of Congress were called immediately after the mission, which he said was \"largely a law enforcement function.\" Notifying members ahead of the action could have jeopardized the mission, he said.\"This was not the kind of mission that you can do congressional notification on. It was a trigger-based mission... it's just simply not the kind of mission you can call people and say, 'Hey, we may do this at some point in the next 15 days,\" Rubio said. \"Congress has a tendency to leak. This would not be good. If they leaked... I think it would have been maybe a very different result,\" Trump said at the press conference. \"Congress will leak, and we don't want leakers,\" he continued.The Trump administration has ramped up pressure on the Venezuelan government in recent months, alleging that Maduro is the head of a narco-terror organization. He recently ordered a complete blockade on sanctioned oil tankers moving in and out of the country and has been targeting alleged Venezuelan drug boats.House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., said in a statement that he had spoken \"in the last several hours\" with Rubio and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and that the White House was working to schedule briefings with members when Congress is back in session next week.\"President Trump is putting American lives first, succeeding where others have failed, and under his leadership the United States will no longer allow criminal regimes to profit from wreaking havoc and destruction on our country,\" Johnson said.Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., called the operation an \"important first step to bring [Maduro] to justice for the drug crimes for which he has been indicted in the United States.\" Neither Thune nor Johnson, through their offices, responded to requests for comment on whether Republican leaders had been briefed ahead of the attack.\"I spoke to Secretary Rubio early this morning, and I look forward to receiving further briefings from the administration on this operation as part of its comprehensive counternarcotics strategy when the Senate returns to Washington next week,\" Thune said.As news of the attack on Venezuela broke early Saturday, there was at least some Republican skepticism.\"I look forward to learning what, if anything, might constitutionally justify this action in the absence of a declaration of war or authorization for the use of military force,\" Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, posted to X.Hours later, and after a phone call with Rubio, Lee had changed his tune.\"This action likely falls within the president's inherent authority under Article II of the Constitution to protect U.S. personnel from an actual or imminent attack,\" Lee said in a subsequent post.Rep. Marjorie Taylor Green, R-Ga., the former Trump ally who had a falling-out with the president and is resigning from Congress on Jan. 5, was part of a small group within the GOP who questioned the attack. \"(W)hy is it ok for America to militarily invade, bomb, and arrest a foreign leader but Russia is evil for invading Ukraine and China is bad for aggression against Taiwan? Is it only ok if we do it? (I'm not endorsing Russia or China),\" Greene posted to X on Saturday.And Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., a frequent foil to Trump, questioned the constitutionality of Trump's removal of Maduro.\"If this action were constitutionally sound, the Attorney General wouldn't be tweeting that they've arrested the President of a sovereign country and his wife for possessing guns in violation of a 1934 U.S. firearm law,\" Massie posted to X.Democrats, meanwhile, called for more answers and questioned what might come next for Venezuela, where Maduro has ruled for more than a decade.\"Maduro is an illegitimate ruler, but I have seen no evidence that his presidency poses a threat that would justify military action without Congressional authorization, nor have I heard a strategy for the day after and how we will prevent Venezuela from descending into chaos,\" Rep. Jim Himes, D-Conn., ranking member on the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, said in a statement.\"Secretary Rubio repeatedly denied to Congress that the Administration intended to force regime change in Venezuela. The Administration must immediately brief Congress on its plan to ensure stability in the region,\" Himes continued.House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., in a statement on Saturday, also said Trump did not properly notify Congress of the military action. He questioned how many American troops would remain on the ground and who would run Venezuela now that Maduro has been deposed.\"Pursuant to the Constitution, the framers gave Congress the sole power to declare war as the branch of government closest to the American people,\" Jeffries said. \"The House and Senate must be briefed immediately and compelling evidence to explain and justify this unauthorized use of military force should be presented forthwith.\"",

    "body": "U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio speaks as U.S. President Donald Trump stands behind him during a press conference following a U.S. strike on Venezuela where President Nicolas Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, were captured, from Trump's Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Florida, U.S., January 3, 2026. Jonathan Ernst | ReutersU.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio on Sunday appeared to backtrack on President Donald Trump's claim that the U.S. will \"run\" Venezuela after U.S. forces on Saturday captured Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and hauled him to the U.S. Asked for details on how the U.S. plans to run Venezuela, Rubio said the U.S. would use leverage gained from its oil blockade on the country and regional military buildup to achieve its policy aims. He did not say the U.S. would directly govern Venezuela.The U.S. in recent months has seized tankers associated with the country and moved military ships and warplanes into the Caribbean. \"What's going to happen here is we have a quarantine on their oil, that means their economy will not be able to move forward until the conditions that are in the national interest of the United States and the interests of the Venezuelan people are met, and that's what we intend to do,\" Rubio said on ABC's \"This Week with George Stephanopoulos.\" \"That leverage remains, that leverage is ongoing and we expect that it's going to lead to results here,\" Rubio said. Pressed by the host of NBC's \"Meet the Press,\" Kristen Welker, on who is running Venezuela, Rubio was more direct. \"Well, it's not running,\" Rubio said. \"It's running policy, the policy with regard to this. We want Venezuela to move in a certain direction.\"Trump said on Saturday said the U.S. would \"run the country until such time as we can do a safe, proper and judicious transition.\" The comments sparked a firestorm of criticism from Trump's adversaries and some allies, who warned against a nation-building exercise in Venezuela. \"We have learned through the years when America tries to do regime change and nation building in this way, the American people pay the price in both blood and dollars,\" Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said on ABC on Sunday. Venezuelan Vice President Delcy Rodríguez was sworn in as president following Maduro's capture. Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, arrived in New York on Saturday night to face charges related to drug trafficking. Rubio's comments suggest that the U.S. will take a softer approach with Venezuela than Trump's initial suggestions of ruling the country with a \"group.\" Though Rubio said Trump still may take further military action to achieve U.S. goals. Asked on \"Meet the Press\" about further military action in Venezuela, Rubio said Trump \"retains all his optionality.\"Rubio also extrapolated on the U.S.' aims with Venezuela's oil reserves. Trump on Saturday said the U.S. is \"going to have our very large United States oil companies — the biggest anywhere in the world — go in, spend billions of dollars, fix the badly broken infrastructure, the oil infrastructure.\"Venezuela sits on the largest proven oil reserves in the world. \"Ultimately, this is not about securing the oil fields; this is about ensuring that no sanctioned oil can come in and out until they make changes to the governance of that entire industry,\" Rubio said on ABC. \"The way to address it to the benefit of the Venezuelan people is to get private companies that are not from Iran or somewhere else to go in and invest in the equipment.\" Rubio said he has not spoken to specific U.S. oil companies about the prospect of starting business in Venezuela. Currently, only Chevron operates in the country. \"We're pretty certain that there will be dramatic interest from Western companies,\" Rubio said. Rubio said Interior Secretary Doug Burgum and Energy Secretary Chris Wright will be \"taking an assessment and speaking to some of these companies.\"Clarification: The U.S. military captured Nicolas Maduro and removed him from Venezuela. That was not clear in a reference in an earlier version of this article.",

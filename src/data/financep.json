    "body": "The best company to work for in 2026 isn't a buzzy tech startup — it's a family-owned carwash company based in Indiana, according to Glassdoor's 18th annual Best Places to Work report.Glassdoor named Crew Carwash as the number one place to work in 2026, based on their analysis of employee feedback from U.S.-based companies with at least 1,000 workers submitted between October 2024 and October 2025. The full list encompasses 100 companies.Employees were asked to rate their overall satisfaction with their employer, as well as workplace attributes like career opportunities, compensation and benefits, culture and values, diversity and inclusion, senior management and work-life balance.A common trait among the top companies on the list is that they are \"continuing to invest in employees,\" says Daniel Zhao, chief economist at Glassdoor.With widespread layoffs at major companies, \"2025 was a year of very high uncertainty in the economy, and thus for workers,\" he says. The best employers are the ones that helped \"their employees adapt to this uncertain environment,\" he continues.Here are the top 10 best companies to work for in 2026, according to Glassdoor.1. Crew CarwashCompany rating: 4.6Headquarters: Fishers, INIndustry: Retail2. In-N-Out BurgerCompany rating: 4.5Headquarters: Irvine, CAIndustry: Food service3.

Houston MethodistCompany rating: 4.4Headquarters: Houston, TXIndustry: Healthcare10. EPAM SystemsCompany rating: 4.4Headquarters: Newtown, PAIndustry: TechnologyCrew Carwash rose to the top spot on the list this year after ranking second in 2024. Glassdoor cites supportive leadership, opportunities for career growth and team culture as key factors that contribute to the company's success. One trend Zhao points to in this year's report is the \"ongoing decline\" of tech companies on the list.While tech is still the best-represented industry, with 24 companies on Glassdoor's list of 100, the number of tech companies on Glassdoor's list has decreased consistently, down from 26 companies in 2025 and 31 companies in 2024.\"This is a continuation of what we've seen for tech across several years, where the industry has lost some of its luster as some of these big tech companies undergo layoffs,\" Zhao says.Flexibility is one of the main criteria that employees are looking for in the workplace, according to Zhao.\"Some of these large companies [are] really pushing on return to office, or being much more strict about the hours that people are working,\" he says. \"What we hear from workers is that they really value flexibility.\"Still, the tech industry offers \"potentially very high pay and career opportunities,\" he says, \"even though it isn't quite at its peak\" in popularity.The retail and manufacturing industries increased their representation on this year's list to 10 and nine companies, respectively. This year's list \"really goes to show that finding the best place to work is is not limited to just one industry or just one job,\" Zhao says. \"There are these employers across a whole host of different sectors and parts of the country that offer best-in-class employee experience.\"Want to get ahead at work with AI?

    "body": "Algi Febri Sugita | SOPA Images | Lightrocket | Getty ImagesNetflix said on Tuesday it had reached 325 million global paid subscribers, a new milestone for the streaming giant that last reported membership numbers a year ago. The company reported fourth-quarter earnings and revenue that narrowly beat Wall Street estimates. Here's how Netflix performed for the period ended Dec. 31, compared with estimates from analysts polled by LSEG:Earnings per share: 56 cents vs. 55 cents, estimatedRevenue: $12.05 billion vs $11.97 billion, estimatedNet income for the fourth quarter was $2.42 billion, or 56 cents per share, up from $1.87 billion, or 43 cents per share, during the same period a year earlier. Netflix said revenue during the period rose 18% year over year, driven by membership growth, higher subscription pricing and increased advertising revenue. In recent years Netflix has been focused on growing its ad-supported membership tier. Netflix launched its ad-supported option in late 2022. On Tuesday, it said 2025 ad revenue grew by more than 2.5-times from 2024 to over $1.5 billion.The company said it expects 2026 overall revenue to range between $50.7 billion and $51.7 billion, due to increases in membership and pricing, as well as \"a projected rough doubling of ad revenue in 2026\" compared to the prior year. On Tuesday's earnings call with investors, Netflix leaders noted what they described as heated competition among industry peers when it comes to gaining subscribers and growing profitability. \"Looking ahead to '26 we're focused on improving the core business, you know, and we do that by increasing the variety and quality of our series and films,\" said co-CEO Ted Sarandos. Still, Netflix's stock was down more than 4% in after-market trading on Tuesday. Netflix's report drew comparisons to a Wall Street Journal report from April that outlined ambitious internal financial targets at the streamer. By those lofty standards, Netflix's growth underwhelmed. But co-CEO Greg Peters said Tuesday the internal targets were considered \"long-term aspirations\" and not to be confused with a forecast. \"Having said that, those goals were based on organic process,\" Peters added, noting they didn't take into account the impact of mergers and acquisitions. WBD deal updateNetflix's quarterly report comes against the backdrop of its proposed transaction of Warner Bros. Discovery's streaming and film studio assets. The company announcement in December that it had agreed to acquire streamer HBO Max and the Warner Bros. film studio for $27.75 per WBD share, or an equity value of $72 billion.Earlier on Tuesday Netflix amended its offer to be all-cash. The company said Tuesday it would pause share repurchases to fund the acquisition. Netflix said in its letter to shareholders that it believes the transaction will \"allow us to accelerate our business strategy.\" Netflix said Warner Bros.' library, development and intellectual property will allow it to boost its content selection for members and that HBO Max will help to \"offer more personalized and flexible subscription options.\" However, the proposed acquisition came as a shock to the market as the streaming giant has long stayed away from industry consolidation and mega deals. Since October, when Netflix was first rumored to be interested in the assets, the company's stock has dropped nearly 30%.And the potential acquisition has not been without its bumps. Soon after announcing the deal with Netflix, Paramount Skydance launched a hostile effort to buy all of WBD. Lawmakers and industry insiders have also raised questions about whether the Netflix deal could win necessary regulatory approval. \"We're working really hard to close the acquisition of Warner Bros. Studios and HBO, which we see as a strategic accelerant,\" Sarandos said on Tuesday's call. \"And we're doing all this while we're driving and sustaining healthy growth.\"Netflix has started the regulatory process, Sarandos said, adding he is confident the company will be able to secure regulatory approval \"because this deal is pro-consumer, ... pro-innovation, pro-worker.\" The company has repeatedly argued the combination would preserve jobs during a time of heavy layoffs across media. On Tuesday, Sarandos said the Warner Bros. assets would bring the addition of businesses that don't already exist for Netflix. \"We're going to need those teams, these folks that have extensive experience and expertise. We want them to stay on and run those business,\" Sarandos said. \"So we're expanding content creation, not collapsing it in this transaction.\"Sarandos and Peters both discussed the high level of competition in the media industry, which they said spans various platforms — from traditional TV to social media platforms like YouTube. Proving that Netflix is a small part of an expansive competitive landscape is likely to be key to Netflix's argument to antitrust regulators, CNBC previously reported. ",

    "body": "European lawmakers on Wednesday suspended the approval of the trade deal that the EU and U.S. agreed in July.In a statement on Wednesday, European Parliament member Bernd Lange, and INTA chair on EU-US trade relations, said the recent plans by President Donald Trump to impose tariffs of between 10% to 25% on European nations go against the terms of the trade pact.Referring to Trump's address at the World Economic Forum in Davos on Wednesday, Lange said: \"I guess he didn't revise his position. He wants to have Greenland as part of the United States as quick as possible.\"In his speech, the president called for \"immediate negotiations\" on the acquisition of the Arctic territory.watch nowTrump ruled out the use of military force in his speech, a commitment Lange described as a \"small positive element.\"However, Lange said the proposed 10% to 25% tariffs remain on the table,  adding that, until the threat of them is over, \"there will be no possibility of compromise.\"\"We will hold on the procedure... until there is clarity regarding Greenland and the threats,\" he said.\"There was a breaking of the Scotland deal by President Trump,\" Lange said, referring to the trade pact agreed by the EU and the U.S. at Trump's Turnberry golf resort last year.Lange said Trump is \"using tariffs as an instrument of political pressure\" as a way to buy Greenland, and described the move as \"an attack against the economic and territorial sovereignty of the European Union.\"He added that the Committee on International Trade would on Monday discuss the use of the EU's Anti-Coercion Instrument (ACI) — a far-reaching measure variously described as a \"trade bazooka\" — which would allow the EU to substantially restrict U.S. companies' access to its single market, block them from tenders, reduce the flow of goods and capital, and curb foreign direct investment in the bloc.\"This was created exactly for such a case when a foreign country [uses] tariffs and investment for political and coercive pressure,\" Lange said of the ACI.Earlier in the day, Bundesbank president Joachim Nagel told CNBC that he hoped Trump would reverse his stance, calling the transatlantic tensions a \"very problematic situation.\"Nagel, a governing council member of the European Central Bank, acknowledged that the tariff threat will likely have \"some spillover\" to monetary policy in the region.Speaking to CNBC's Karen Tso at the World Economic Forum gathering in Davos Wednesday, Nagel said the tariff dispute could \"maybe\" be a game changer for monetary policy in the eurozone, which he said was still on \"a good path.\"\"I still have the hope that we can find a solution, a joint understanding,\" Nagel added.

    "body": "Artificial intelligence startups OpenAI and Anthropic have their sights set on enterprise customers this year as they race to win more revenue, users and market share. In separate interviews with CNBC at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland on Wednesday, Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei and OpenAI CFO Sarah Friar highlighted enterprise as a key revenue driver for their businesses. Enterprise customers account for roughly 40% of OpenAI's business as of January, but Friar said she expects that figure to grow to closer to 50% by the end of the year. OpenAI announced in November that more than 1 million business customers around the world are using the company's technology.  OpenAI was founded as a nonprofit AI lab in 2015, and its valuation has swelled to $500 billion since the launch of its ChatGPT chatbot in 2022. \"We're an incredibly strong business today,\" Friar said Wednesday. \"As we look forward, for us, it's eyes on the prize of, 'How do we add value to the consumer? How do we add value to enterprises? And how do we close this capability gap?'

He attributed roughly 80% of Anthropic's business to enterprises and 20% to consumers, adding that the startup has embraced enterprises in part because they are a relatively predictable and stable source of income. \"Since the beginning, Anthropic has thought in terms of safety and reliability of AI systems, and one of the things we realized is that that was very synergistic with working with enterprises as compared to consumers,\" Amodei said.As of September, Anthropic had amassed more than 300,000 business customers, up from less than 1,000 two years prior. Anthropic was founded by a group of former OpenAI executives and researchers in 2021, and its valuation has since climbed to $350 billion.

    "body": "Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook delivers remarks during an event organized by the Psaros Center for Financial Markets and Policy at the Georgetown University's McDonough School of Business at the university on Nov. 20, 2025 in Washington, DC.Chip Somodevilla | Getty ImagesThe Supreme Court began hearing oral arguments on Wednesday morning in a case over whether President Donald Trump has the power to fire Lisa Cook as a governor of the Federal Reserve for uncharged allegations that she committed mortgage fraud.Solicitor General D. John Sauer, the lawyer who is arguing for the Trump administration, from the beginning of the hearing faced pointed questions from justices.\"The real question is to what extent we believe the public is harmed to allow Ms. Cook to remain in post during the pendency of this case?\" asked Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, referring to Cook's lawsuit challenging her removal, which remains pending in a federal district court.Sauer replied, \"We assert grievous, irreparable injury to the public perception to the Federal Reserve of allowing [Cook] to stay in office.\"Jackson asked, \"Do you have evidence other than the president's view?\"At stake is not only the fate of Cook — who denies any wrongdoing — but potentially the Fed's future independence to set monetary policy without the risk of a president being able to easily remove a governor who fails to do their bidding on that issue.Underscoring those stakes is the recent disclosure by Fed Chairman Jerome Powell that he is the subject of a criminal investigation by the U.S. Attorney's Office in Washington, D.C., in connection with his oversight of a multi-billion-dollar renovation of the central bank's headquarters there.Powell, who planned to attend Wednesday's arguments at the Supreme Court, has said the real reason for that probe is the Fed holding interest rates steady for much of last year to Trump's ire.Cook was one of the Fed governors who backed Powell in maintaining those rates. Members of the media in front of the US Supreme Court in Washington, DC, US, on Tuesday, Jan. 20, 2026. Al Drago | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesWhen Trump moved to fire Cook in late August — the first time a president had ever attempted such a move — there was immediate speculation it was due to her refusal to agree to cut interest rates as Trump wanted.If Cook and Powell were to be removed from the Fed's seven-member board, Trump would be in a position to appoint a majority of that board — and, theoretically at the least, have more influence over interest rate decisions.Trump did not cite Cook's stance on interest rates when he said he was firing her.Instead, the president cited allegations made by Federal Housing Finance Director Bill Pulte that she had made false statements in applying for home mortgages, which predated her appointment to the Fed by then-President Joe Biden in 2022 to fill an unexpired board term. Cook, the first Black woman to serve on the Fed board, was reappointed by Biden in 2023 to serve a full 14-year term.Lisa Cook, governor of the US Federal Reserve, and U.S. President Donald Trump.Ting Shen | Bloomberg | Getty Images | Jonathan Ernst | ReutersUnder the Federal Reserve Act of 1913, only the president can terminate a Fed board member, and a governor like Cook can only be terminated \"for cause.\"The law does not detail what would constitute \"cause,\" but cause has historically been understood to mean malfeasance or dereliction of duty.After Cook sued Trump to block her removal from the Fed, a federal District Court judge in Washington ruled that she could remain with the central bank pending the outcome of her lawsuit.Judge Jia Cobb, in that ruling, wrote that \"Cook has made a strong showing that her purported removal was done in violation of the Federal Reserve Act's 'for cause' provision.\"Cobb said that \"best reading\" of that provision is that the alleged cause for removal relates to a governor's actions while \"in office.\"The allegations against Cook relate to actions she took before joining the Fed.The Department of Justice appealed Cobb's ruling, but was unsuccessful. The DOJ then asked the Supreme Court to take the case.In a filing, the DOJ said that the \"determination of cause\" for termination is subject to \"the unreviewable discretion of the President.\"\"In any case, the President has identified sufficient cause here,\" the filing says.Read more CNBC politics coverageRussia watches as ally Iran edges closer to collapse.

Thom Tillis vows to block Trump's Fed nominees following Powell probe\"That the Federal Reserve Board plays a uniquely important role in the American economy only heightens the government's and the public's interest in ensuring that an ethically compromised member does not continue wielding its vast powers,\" the filing says\"Put simply, the President may reasonably determine that interest rates paid by the American people should not be set by a Governor who appears to have lied about facts material to the interest rates she secured for herself—and refuses to explain the apparent misrepresentation,\" the filing said.A general view of U.S. Supreme Court as justices could issue at least one ruling in several major cases pending including a decision on the legality of President Donald Trump's sweeping global tariffs, in Washington, D.C., U.S., Jan. 20, 2026.  Nathan Howard | ReutersAll three former living Fed chairs — Alan Greenspan, Ben Bernanke, and Janet Yellen — signed on to a legal brief with the Supreme Court arguing against Cook's removal, along with a group of former Treasury secretaries, chairs of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, and others.The brief says that Congress \"intentionally\" designed the Fed \"as a uniquely independent entity, largely insulated from political pressures that could otherwise prioritize short-term economic gain over long-term stability and growth.\"\"Granting the government's request to remove Governor Cook from the Board immediately would upset these longstanding protections and the essential functions they serve,\" the brief says. \"Doing so would expose the Federal Reserve to political influences, thereby eroding public confidence in the Fed's independence and jeopardizing the credibility and efficacy of U.S. monetary policy.\"",

Berkshire is Kraft Heinz's largest shareholder.Shares of Kraft Heinz fell about 5% in Wednesday's trading following the news.The move underscores Abel's willingness to move on from a deal that has long stood out as a rare blemish in Buffett's otherwise storied record. Kraft Heinz shares have plunged about 70% since the 2015 merger that created the ketchup-making giant, weighed down by shifting consumer tastes, rising costs and sluggish growth across core brands. Some of the loss has been offset with billions of dollars in dividends over the years, but last year Berkshire still took a $3.8 billion writedown on the value of its holding. The latest filing also came as Kraft Heinz seeks to separate into two companies: one focused on sauces, spreads and shelf-stable meals and a second that includes North American staples like Oscar Mayer meats, Kraft cheese singles and Lunchables.Buffett himself has acknowledged his frustration with how the merger he orchestrated a decade ago ultimately unraveled.\"It certainly didn't turn out to be a brilliant idea to put them together, but I don't think taking them apart will fix it,\" Buffett, who remains Berkshire's chairman, told CNBC last year.The registration statement gives Berkshire the flexibility to reduce the position, rather than signaling an imminent sale, according to Stifel.\"The registration provides Berkshire Hathaway the ability to reduce its ownership stake; we believe transaction notifications are not required outside of quarterly 13F filings,\" Stifel analysts wrote. \"The next update is likely to be in mid-May, when Berkshire reports its first fiscal quarter activity.\"Stifel reiterated a hold rating on Kraft Heinz and a $26 price target, citing softer U.S. consumption trends and slower growth in emerging markets that could delay any revenue growth, even as the company continues to generate strong cash flow.In 2015, Berkshire teamed up with Brazilian private equity firm 3G Capital to merge Kraft Foods with H.J. Heinz. 3G Capital quietly exited its Kraft Heinz investment in 2023, after years of periodically trimming its stake as the combined company struggled.",

    "body": "Reliance Retail's revenue grew just 8.1% on year and its EBITDA, improved a mere 2% during the December quarter.Sheldon Cooper | Sopa Images | Lightrocket | Getty ImagesIndia's largest business group, Reliance Industries, has been battling geopolitical headwinds in its oil refining and, reportedly, in one of its new energy ventures. But those are not the oil-to-telecom conglomerate's biggest worries. The slowdown in its retail business, the group's third largest vertical, has had analysts reduce earnings estimates and cut stock target price, even as they maintain a buy rating on Reliance shares.Reliance Retail's revenue grew just 8.1% on year and its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization, or EBITDA, improved a mere 2% during the last quarter, raising doubts over its ability to deliver high growth.\"We are confident of delivering 20%+ plus CAGR [compound annual growth rate] in retail revenues over the next three years,\" Isha Ambani, who heads the retail business, told shareholders at the company's annual meeting last year.     Macquarie Capital has removed Reliance from its Asia Marquee list. Reliance Retail \"is a key swing factor\" in the group's sum-of-the-parts valuation due to the slowdown in its growth momentum, the global brokerage said in a report on Monday.Citi has cut its target price to 1,815 rupees ($19.9) per share from 1,860 rupees while UBS has lowered it to 1,790 rupees from 1,820 rupees. UBS was expecting the retail business to grow 10% on year in the December quarter.Just ahead of the festive season, in September, the Indian government slashed goods and service tax rates in order to spur domestic consumption. But the pick up in demand has been uneven across segments with sales of gold and cars increasing in the December quarter while fashion and consumer staples reported softer growth.\"We don't see any incremental near-term catalyst for consumer demand and go into 2026 with somber expectations. While we hope for a delayed impact of the stimulus measures, we expect only a gradual recovery at best, not a dramatic rebound,\" Bernstein said in a note earlier this week. Reliance Retail peers such as Avenue Supermarkets and Tata Group's Trent have also reported slower growth in the December quarter. Reliance has said festive season demand last year was split across second and third quarters, resulting in softer growth numbers. Reliance Retail has also argued that its December quarter results are not comparable year on year as its consumer staples business was demerged and now is a direct subsidy of Reliance Industries.  The gross revenue of consumer staples business was 50.65 billion rupees ($556.8 million)  in the December quarter, or roughly 5% of Reliance Retail's revenue of 976 billion rupee. Brokerages do not see the December quarter results as blip in the company's growth, but more of a secular downtrend. Citi on Monday pared its estimates for Reliance's consolidated EBITDA, from financial year 2026 to 2028 by 1%-2%, citing \"moderation\" in the retail business.Reliance Industries' shares have lost nearly 5% since its earnings were announced, even though the company's core oil refining business appears to be navigating well a tough business environment and its large telecom business reported steady growth.   Weathering headwindsReliance had to cut back on imports of cheap Russian oil as the U.S. imposed sanctions on oil firms Rosneft and Lukoil, one of which had a long-term supply contract with the Indian firm.The company has been one of the largest consumers of Russian crude oil, which accounted for 40%-45% of its crude mix at its peak, said Pankaj Srivastava, senior vice president of commodity markets-oil at Rystad Energy.EBITDA for oil-to-chemicals business, which includes refining and petrochemicals, rose 15% year on year and as \"refining cracks [margins] strength more than offset lower Russian crude intake, higher freight rates and petchem weakness,\" Goldman Sachs said in a report on Monday. Geopolitical concerns appear to have also weighed on the company's new energy business. A report from Bloomberg last week claimed that the company's plans of setting up a battery storage plant with an annual capacity of 40 gigawatt were put on hold. The report claimed that the Indian company was unable to procure technology from China owing to Beijing's curbs on technology transfer.During its earnings call the company denied any delays in the project. Karan Suri, senior vice president of new energy business, said the company was \"fast progressing on setting up our 40 gigawatt battery storage plant and the commissioning will happen over \"next few quarters.\"Untouched by domestic consumption worries or geopolitical tensions, the telecom business of Reliance, continued to deliver a steady performance, in line with expectations of brokerages such as UBS and Citi.The business, which is looking to list this year, reported a 12.7% year on year rise in its revenue and 16.4% rise in EBITDA. It added 8.9 million customers in the quarter taking its total subscriber base to 515 million. ",

    "body": "An \"Open House\" sign outside a home in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida, US, on Sunday, Jan. 11, 2026. Zak Bennett | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesStagnant mortgage rates, falling housing supply and ongoing economic uncertainty weighed heavily on homebuyers in December. Pending home sales, a measure of signed contracts on existing homes, dropped 9.3% last month from November, according to the National Association of Realtors. Analysts were expecting a slight gain. Sales were 3% lower than December 2024.\"The housing sector is not out of the woods yet,\" said Lawrence Yun, chief economist for the Realtors. \"After several months of encouraging signs in pending contracts and closed sales, the December new contract figures have dampened the short-term outlook.\"Sales fell month-to-month in all regions of U.S. and were higher annually only in the South. Homes also stayed on the market longer in December, at an average of 39 days compared with 35 days in December 2024.Mortgage rates in December, when these deals were inked, barely moved at all. The average rate on the popular 30-year fixed loan sat around 6.25%, according to Mortgage News Daily. That is slightly lower than it was over the summer, but consumers were also facing a market with fewer homes available for sale.

Inventory was up 12% from a year ago, but that is off an extremely low level. \"Consumers prefer seeing abundant inventory before making the major decision of purchasing a home. So, the decline in pending home sales could be a result of dampened consumer enthusiasm about buying a home when there are so few options listed for sale,\" Yun added. ",

    "body": "watch nowA startup widely known as \"ChatGPT for doctors\" raised a new funding round that values the company at $12 billion. OpenEvidence, based in Miami, Florida, closed a $250 million financing, led by Thrive Capital and DST, the company told CNBC. The startup first raised outside capital in February, when it reeled in $75 million from Sequoia at a $1 billion valuation, before its value jumped to $6 billion in October. In less than a year, OpenEvidence has raised $700 million from investors including Google's venture arm, Nvidia, Kleiner Perkins, David Sacks' Craft Ventures and Mayo Clinic.The company was founded in 2022 by Daniel Nadler, who previously built Kensho Technologies, an artificial intelligence company that was acquired by Standard & Poor's for about $700 million in 2018, and by Zachary Ziegler, a Harvard PhD student in AI. Nadler's newest venture provides a chatbot for doctors, with its AI models having been trained on data and information from top scientific journals, Nadler said in an interview. \"'ChatGPT for doctors' is a useful shorthand, but what we really do is help physicians make high-stakes clinical decisions at the point of care,\" Nadler said. \"It's not trained on the open internet or social media, which can introduce low-quality medical information.\"Nadler claimed OpenEvidence is the most widely used AI platform by doctors in the U.S., with more than 40% of physicians utilizing the tool. He pointed to the massive opportunity in health care, which accounts for nearly 20% of U.S. gross domestic product with $5 trillion in annual spending.\"Health care is the largest segment of the real economy,\" Nadler said. \"People realize there could be a lot of winners in the space.\"Those names could include OpenAI and Anthropic. OpenAI launched \"ChatGPT Health\" earlier this month, while Anthropic has \"Claude Healthcare.\" Both are Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or HIPAA, compliant extensions of their popular consumer chatbots. While competition is emerging, Nadler said his company's moat is its focus on physicians, quality of data and a first-mover advantage. \"We've already gathered hundreds of millions of real-world clinical consultations from verified physicians — that feedback loop is incredibly hard to replicate,\" Nadler said. \"Even if someone copied the playbook today, they'd still be far behind because it's not just the partnerships, it's the real-world usage data.\"Relying on advertisingOpenEvidence said it topped $100 million in annualized revenue last year, mostly fueled by organic growth. Nadler said 95% of new users hear about OpenEvidence from another physician. \"Most health care in America isn't happening at billion-dollar hospitals in New York or San Francisco,\" Nadler said. \"It's happening in small practices that don't have IT departments or budgets for expensive software.\" OpenEvidence was one of the first AI startups to rely on advertising for revenue, which Nadler said allows faster adoption and wider use versus a paid subscription model. Companies can pay for promotions through video ads on the OpenEvidence app.The artificial intelligence industry has started to warm up to ad-based revenue. Last week, OpenAI said it was testing an ad-supported version of ChatGPT. Nadler said he's trying to be more disciplined than some companies that are \"openly planning to burn billions or tens of billions over the next several years.\"\"That's a big bet, and a very risky bet,\" Nadler said, adding that OpenEvidence is trying to balance growth with eventual profitability. \"We're not running this like a private equity portfolio company, but we're also not planning on burning billions of dollars over the next year.\"AI startups are picking up this year where they left off in 2025. In the third quarter of last year, there were six AI funding rounds of more than $1 billion, according to CB Insights. Anthropic is in talks to raise an additional $10 billion as of January, while Elon Musk's xAI announced a $20 billion round this month. Nadler said that with the big tech companies aggressively pursuing acquisitions in the space, he's felt the pressure, but has remained set on building OpenEvidence as a stand-alone company. \"I've done the acquisition route before,\" he said. \"It can be great. But this time, I want to build something that compounds over many years.\" As for an initial public offering, he said SpaceX, OpenAI and Anthropic, which have all been rumored to be potential 2026 candidates, need to go public first. \"There's an order to nature,\" Nadler said. \"Foundation model companies go public first. Then the application layer follows. That's how the internet played out, and that's how this cycle will play out, too.\"WATCH: OpenAI investor letterwatch now",

    "body": "Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, is pictured on Sept. 25, 2025, in Berlin.Florian Gaertner | Photothek | Getty ImagesOpenAI on Tuesday said it is rolling out an age prediction model to its ChatGPT consumer plans to help the artificial intelligence company identify accounts that belong to users under 18 years old.The model relies on a combination of account-level signals and behavioral signals, OpenAI said. Some of those signals include usage patterns over time, how long an account has existed, the typical times of day a user is active and the user's stated age. OpenAI has rolled out several new safety features in recent months as it faces mounting scrutiny over how it protects users, particularly minors. The AI startup and other tech companies are facing a probe from the FTC over how their AI chatbots potentially negatively affect children and teenagers, and OpenAI is named in several wrongful death lawsuits, including one that centers around a teenage boy's death by suicide. Once OpenAI's age prediction model suggests that a user is under 18, OpenAI said, ChatGPT will automatically apply protections designed to reduce exposure to \"sensitive content,\" like depictions of self-harm. If users are incorrectly identified as being under 18, they will be able to use the identity-verification service Persona to restore their full access.

In August, OpenAI said it would release parental controls to help them understand and shape how their teens are using ChatGPT. The following month, OpenAI rolled out its parental controls and said it was working to build an age prediction system. The company also convened a council of eight experts in October who will provide insight into how AI could affect users' mental health, emotions and motivation. OpenAI said Tuesday that it will continue to improve the accuracy of its age prediction model over time.

Zak Bennett | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesMortgage refinancing jumped sharply higher for the second straight week, as interest rates fell further, but that boom may be about to bust. Interest rates are now moving much higher.Last week, applications to refinance a home loan rose 20% compared with the previous week, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association's seasonally adjusted index. Applications were 183% higher than the same week one year ago. The average contract interest rate for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages with conforming loan balances, $832,750 or less, decreased to 6.16% from 6.18%, with points falling to 0.54 from 0.56, including the origination fee, for loans with a 20% down payment. That is the lowest rate since September 2024.\"Mortgage rates declined further last week, driving another big week for refinance applications, which saw the strongest level of activity since September 2025,\" said Joel Kan, MBA's vice president and deputy chief economist. \"These lower rates prompted greater refinance activity from conventional and VA refinance borrowers, with increases of 29 percent and 26 percent, respectively.

Rates only fell 9 basis points across the two weeks, but the focus on it in the news may have caused an outsized reaction. The 30-year fixed was 86 basis points lower year over year.Applications for a mortgage to purchase a home rose 5% for the week and were 18% higher than the same week one year ago. Homebuyers are still contending with high home prices and continued uncertainty in the broader economy. There are more homes available for sale, but affordability, despite slightly lower rates, is still a major impediment. Interest rates moved much higher to start this week, as bond markets sold off following the Trump's threats of new tariffs and escalating tensions over Greenland. The average rate on the 30-year fixed jumped 14 basis points higher, according to a separate survey from Mortgage News Daily. \"This matches the level seen the day before the announcement of the administration's $200 billion mortgage bond buying plans. The last time rates were higher was December 23rd,\" wrote Matthew Graham, chief operating officer at Mortgage News Daily. \"In light of that announcement, why aren't mortgage rates doing better? Simply put, the market has already reacted to that news to the extent allowed by its transparency.\"",

The tax would apply to California residents as of Jan. 1, 2026.Sacks insisted that \"it's not a one-time, it's a first time.\"\"And if they get away with it, there'll be a second time and a third time. And this will be the beginning of something new and different in this country, which is asset seizure,\" he said.Read more CNBC tech newsTech stocks lead Wall Street sell-off as tensions over Greenland escalateMost of Instagram's ads ran on Reels in 2025, data showsOpenAI to focus on 'practical adoption' in 2026, says finance chief Sarah FriarElon Musk's xAI faces tougher road building out data centers after EPA rule updateSacks, who has relocated to Texas after three decades in California, believes the legislation has a \"good chance\" of passing and could set a precedent for similar bills in other states. He called out Gov. Gavin Newsom for his delayed opposition to the bill, which he argued has caused a trillion dollars of net worth to leave the state and put a \"huge hole\" in tax collections. Despite the tax, CEOs like Nvidia's Jensen Huang and OpenAI's Sam Altman have indicated plans to stay in the state. Airbnb CEO Brian Chesky also told CNBC this month that he'll remain in California.But Sacks said smaller businesses in California are more flexible and opting to leave.\"They've got large companies in the state, and California's network effect is powerful,\" he said of large businesses like Nvidia. \"That's why progressives think they can get away with this.\"watch now",

    "body": "Neal Mohan, the CEO of YouTube speaks during a panel for the Summit for Democracy on March 30, 2023 in Washington, DC.Anna Moneymaker | Getty ImagesYouTube CEO Neal Mohan said reducing \"AI slop\" and detecting deepfakes are priorities for the Google-owned video site in 2026. \"It's becoming harder to detect what's real and what's AI-generated,\" Mohan wrote in his annual letter published Wednesday. \"This is particularly critical when it comes to deepfakes.\" With artificial intelligence penetrating every aspect of technology, Google has been investing heavily in building out the infrastructure to support new and growing workloads while also bolstering its Gemini models and adding AI features to its portfolio of business and consumer products. But as one of the leading sources of user-generated content on the internet, YouTube is dealing with an explosion in the number of videos created by AI. The term AI slop refers to the mass of low-quality AI content that's showing up across social media platforms. In addition to YouTube, companies such as Meta and TikTok rely on recommendation systems powered by AI that surface personalized videos designed to keep users engaged for longer periods of time.Mohan said the world is at an \"inflection point,\" where \"the lines between creativity and technology are blurring.\"\"To reduce the spread of low quality AI content, we're actively building on our established systems that have been very successful in combatting spam and clickbait, and reducing the spread of low quality, repetitive content,\" Mohan wrote. He said that YouTube clearly labels videos created by AI products and requires creators to disclose if they've produced altered content. The company's systems also remove \"harmful synthetic media\" that violates its guidelines, Mohan wrote. Critical to YouTube's growth among users, creators and advertisers is keeping the platform desirable for all parties involved. In December, YouTube said it would be expanding its \"likeness detection,\" which flags when a creator's face is used without their permission in deepfakes. The feature is being rolled out to millions of creators in the YouTube Partner Program.Mohan's letter said the company will use AI as a tool and \"not a replacement,\" adding that on average more than 1 million YouTube channels used its artificial intelligence creation technology daily in December.The company is expanding the way creators can take advantage of AI, he said, including on YouTube's short-form video offering called Shorts, which competes with TikTok and Instagram Reels. \"This year you'll be able to create a Short using your own likeness, produce games with a simple text prompt, and experiment with music,\" he wrote. Mohan described creators as \"the new stars and studios,\" and said YouTube creators are \"buying studio-sized lots in Hollywood and beyond to pioneer new formats and produce beautifully produced, must-see TV.\"  The company also wants to provide new ways for creators to earn, from \"shopping and brand deals to fan funding features like Jewels and gifts.\"Another priority, Mohan said, is making YouTube \"the best place for kids and teens\" and said this year the company plans to make it easier for parents to set up new kid accounts and to easily switch between them.YouTube said in September that it's paid out more than $100 billion to creators, artists and media companies since 2021. Earlier in the year, analysts at MoffettNathanson estimated that If it was a stand-alone business, YouTube would be worth between $475 billion and $550 billion.WATCH: How Neal Mohan leads YouTube by putting creators firstwatch now",

    "body": "Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan Chase, speaks at the American Business Forum at the Kaseya Center in Miami on Nov. 6, 2025.Chandan Khanna | AFP | Getty ImagesJPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon on Wednesday advocated for a test of President Donald Trump's proposed 10% cap on credit card interest rates in two U.S. states: Vermont and Massachusetts.Dimon, speaking on a panel at the World Economic Forum at Davos, Switzerland, addressed a question about Trump's order for banks to voluntarily limit their interest rates for a year. The president had called for the lower rates to take effect Tuesday.Several large credit card lenders contacted by CNBC on Tuesday said they had made no changes to their interest rates, but they all declined to be identified as defying Trump's proposal.\"It would be an economic disaster,\" Dimon said Wednesday. \"In the worst case, you'd have a drastic reduction of the credit card business\" for 80% of Americans, he said. In earnings conference calls last week and behind the scenes, banks have pushed back against Trump's order this month to voluntarily forgo billions of dollars in revenue.Their main argument, that price controls will result in lenders canceling accounts for many card customers, has resonated with several Republican lawmakers, including House Speaker Mike Johnson. Most banking analysts believe that Trump would need legislation to enact a nationwide cap on card rates.'A great idea'Dimon then said he had a \"great idea\" to help quell disagreement over the proposed card cap, suggesting that the U.S. government impose the pricing controls on Americans in just two states.Vermont and Massachusetts are the home states of Sens. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, respectively, both of whom support a bill capping card rates at 10% for five years. Dimon didn't mention the lawmakers by name Wednesday.The U.S. government \"should force all the banks to do it in two states, Vermont and Massachusetts, and see what happens,\" Dimon said, drawing laughter from the audience.Dimon said \"the left\" and people who argue for price controls \"will learn a real lesson, and the people crying the most won't be the credit card companies,\" he said.\"It'll be the restaurants, the retailers, the travel companies, the schools, the municipalities, because people miss their water payments,\" he said. \"It would be something else to watch.\"Dimon added that JPMorgan was planning on giving the Trump administration its analysis on what would happen under a national credit card rate cap.\"I think it's wrong for the government to get involved extensively in pricing of stuff, but I got to deal with the world I got,\" Dimon said.watch now",

    "body": "watch nowPresident Donald Trump on Wednesday urged U.S. lawmakers to pass legislation to limit credit card rates to 10%, following his social media post this month ordering banks to voluntarily lower their rates.\"I'm asking Congress to cap credit card interest rates at 10% for one year, and this will help millions of Americans save for a home,\" Trump said from the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.\"They charge Americans interest rates of 28%, 30%, 31%, 32%,\" Trump said. \"Whatever happened to usury?\"Shares of banks climbed after the comments. The KBW Bank index rose 2.2% in morning trading. Capital One, which relies on cards for most of its revenue, advanced 1.9%.Among the options that the Trump administration had for applying pressure to American banks over card rates, the legislative path may be less threatening. A bill was introduced last year from Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri and Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont that would limit card APRs at 10% for five years, but that bill has been stalled in Congress.Analysts including Sanjay Sakhrani of KBW have said it is unlikely that a card bill will have enough bipartisan support to become law. Republican lawmakers, including House Speaker Mike Johnson, have expressed caution when it comes to card price controls.\"If this is the path, the odds of implementation are low,\" Sakhrani said in an interview. \"There is a lot of Republican leadership that opposes the idea\" and other industries, including airlines and retailers, would be hurt by the policy.Breaking 'the law?'The episode may show the limits of President Trump's ability to cajole the financial industry into voluntarily giving up billions of dollars in revenue to support his election-year affordability push.After Trump's Jan. 9 Truth Social post on the rate cap, banks said on earnings conference calls that such a limit would have unintended consequences, including that lenders would simply cancel accounts for many card customers, especially those with lower credit scores.The president told reporters that lenders who didn't comply on rates will be \"in violation of the law,\" but bankers countered, behind closed doors, that they were already compliant with the law. Privately, bankers and their lobbyists told CNBC they hoped to fend off the president's request, given the difficulty of passing legislation. Several large credit card lenders contacted by CNBC on Tuesday said they had made no changes to their interest rates, but they all declined to be identified. KBW's Sakhrani said he wasn't aware of any major card player that took its rates down. On Wednesday, JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon told a Davos audience that the U.S. government should test out the rate cap in just two states, Vermont and Massachusetts.Doing so would teach \"a real lesson\" to those in favor of price controls, Dimon said.\"It would be an economic disaster,\" Dimon said. \"In the worst case, you'd have a drastic reduction of the credit card business\" for 80% of Americans, he said.",

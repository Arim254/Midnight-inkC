    "body": "A Boeing Co. 737 Max airplane at the company's manufacturing facility in Renton, Washington, US, on Thursday, Nov. 20, 2025. David Ryder | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesBoeing is set to report this week that it delivered the most airplanes since 2018 last year after it stabilized its production, the clearest sign of a turnaround yet after years of safety crises and snowballing quality defects. Now, the aerospace giant is planning to ramp up production.\"It's a long road back from a ... shall we say, a rather dysfunctional culture, but they're making big progress,\" said Richard Aboulafia, managing director at AeroDynamic Advisory, an aerospace industry consulting firm.Boeing was forced to scale back production in recent years following two fatal crashes of its popular 737 Max aircraft in 2018 and 2019 and a midair blowout of a door plug from one of its planes in the first week of 2024. The Covid pandemic snarled airplane assembly at both Boeing and its chief rival, Airbus, with supply chain delays and loss of experienced workers, even after the worst of the health crisis subsided.A Boeing 737 approaches San Diego International for a landing, May 10, 2025.Kevin Carter | Getty ImagesBoeing's leaders, including CEO Kelly Ortberg — a longtime aerospace executive who came out of retirement to take the top job months after the midair door plug accident — are gearing up to increase production this year of its cash cow 737 Max aircraft and the longer-range 787 Dreamliners.That could help the manufacturer, the top U.S. exporter by value, return to profitability, as analysts expect this year, territory that was out of reach for seven years as its leaders focused on damage control and were stuck reassuring frustrated airline executives who were awaiting late planes.Their tone has changed as Boeing has become more predictable and increased production, with the Federal Aviation Administration's blessing. In a sign of the FAA's increased confidence in Boeing, the agency in September said Boeing could issue its own air worthiness certificates before customers receive some of its 737s and 787s after years of restrictions.Boeing's commercial aircraft business is its largest unit, accounting for about 46% of sales in the first nine months of last year, with the rest coming from its defense and services business. Boeing last reported a full-year profit in 2018.Investors are optimistic for further improvement. Boeing shares have gained 36% over the last 12 months, outpacing the S&P 500's nearly 20% advance. \"Boeing is definitely better and more stable,\" said Bob Jordan, CEO of all-Boeing airline Southwest Airlines, in an interview Dec. 10. The company is scheduled to outline its production plans for 2026 later this month when it reports quarterly results on Jan. 27.Getting into gearFor Boeing, the recent turnaround has taken place largely on the assembly floor. Under Ortberg, the manufacturer has slashed so-called traveled work, in which assembly tasks are done out of order, to avoid costly mistakes. The company has made other manufacturing changes, as well, including added training.The National Transportation Safety Board in June said inadequate training and management oversight had been among the problems at the company, according to its investigation into what led to the door plug blowout in January 2024.On Dec. 8, Boeing also completed its acquisition of fuselage maker Spirit AeroSystems, which Boeing had spun out of the company two decades ago. It now has more direct control of the crucial supplier.Moving out jetsBoeing handed over 537 aircraft in the first 11 months of last year. It reports December deliveries on Tuesday, but Jefferies estimates the company delivered 61 commercial jets last month, 44 of them Boeing's bestseller, the 737 Max.Boeing delivered 348 aircraft in 2024 and 528 in 2023. Last year's total would still be far off the 806 airplanes it handed over in 2018.Last October, the FAA raised its production cap on Boeing's 737 Max from 38 a month to 42. (The FAA required its sign-off after the door plug accident.) CFO Jay Malave said at a UBS conference on Dec. 2 that he expects the company to get to that rate in early 2026. Ortberg told investors in October that further rate increases are on the table, in increments of five planes.Kelly Ortberg, chief executive officer of Boeing Co., during a media event at the Boeing Delivery Center in Seattle, Washington, US, on Wednesday, Jan. 7, 2026. M. Scott Brauer | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesHandovers to airlines in 2026 will likely be new production, compared with clearing out older inventory, Malave had said. Boeing is also likely to produce about eight Dreamliners a month as of early this year, he added.Deliveries are key for airplane makers, because airlines and other customers pay the bulk of an airplane's price when they receive the aircraft. Boeing's chief competitor, Airbus, is scheduled to report 2025 orders and deliveries on Monday.Still, several planes that were expected to already flying passengers aren't certified yet, including the Boeing 777X as well as the Max 7 and Max 10 variants, depriving Boeing of cash and driving up costs.Southwest is awaiting the delayed Max 7, the smallest plane of the Max family. The model is important for airline routes that have lower demand so airlines can avoid oversupplying the market with seats, pushing down fares.Southwest CEO Jordan last month said that he doesn't expect the airline to fly the Max 7 before the first half of 2027 as Boeing certification work continues. Boeing at one point expected it to enter service in 2019.\"They're still very short in terms of delivering the aircraft that we need, but I'm glad to see the progress on the Max 7,\" Jordan told CNBC. watch nowRobust demandOrders for both Boeing and Airbus jets look solid, with demand set to continue outstripping supply into the next decade, Bernstein aerospace analyst Douglas Harned said in a note last week.Airbus outpaced Boeing in deliveries last year, though Boeing appears to have outsold its European competitor in new orders.Through November, Boeing logged 1,000 gross orders compared with 797 from Airbus. Airline customers have started to look beyond this decade, snagging delivery slots into the mid-2030s as they plot out growth and international expansions.On Wednesday, Alaska Airlines said it is ordering 105 Boeing 737 Max 10 jets, the longest aircraft of the Max group. Alaska fleet chief Shane Jones told CNBC the order is a sign of \"our confidence in the Max 10 certification\" as well as \"our confidence in Boeing and their turnaround and their ability to produce quality aircraft on time.\"  Alaska also exercised options for five 787 Dreamliners for more international routes just over a year after it acquired Hawaiian Airlines — a combination that handed Alaska more Dreamliners and Airbus A330s to reach for destinations that it couldn't get to before, like Japan, South Korea and Italy.The wide-body aircraft market is now picking up steam, said Ron Epstein, aerospace analyst at Bank of America, with orders starting to get handed over faster to customers.

More and more global airlines are looking at snagging long-haul jets like Boeing's Dreamliner and Airbus' A330 and A350s for the coming years, heating up the wide-body airplane market, analysts said.Globally, airplanes flew nearly 84% full in November, the highest level on record, according to the latest data available from the International Air Transport Association, an airline industry group.With travel demand still robust, orders to replace older jets and secure new ones will continue to fuel growth.\"The magic, if you will, of air transportation is until somebody comes up with a transporter, you know, [like] 'Star Trek,' where you sort of vaporize and show up someplace else, we're going to be flying,\" Epstein said.",

    "body": "Around 80% of workers feel unprepared for the job hunt in 2026, new LinkedIn research finds. Filadendron | E+ | Getty ImagesArtificial intelligence could be something of a game changer for recruiters as firms continue to be inundated with job applications, according to one LinkedIn executive.Janine Chamberlin, LinkedIn's U.K. country manager, told CNBC Make It in an interview that AI will be a \"critical part of how hiring is done in 2026,\" as it speeds up processes. \"Last year was the year of experimentation and companies and professionals taking their first steps. 2026 is the year of more widespread adoption of AI tools, particularly in hiring,\" she said. AI can help recruiters speed up manual tasks such as going through very high volumes of applications and sifting through resumes and cover letters to find the right skills for a job. \"We've heard from 60% of recruiters that AI is helping them to find what they would call a 'hidden gem' talent — so people that they would have, in their manual search, overlooked, but actually AI is surfacing that as a candidate that is a good match for a specific job, because it can look very specifically at those skills so critically important to do it well,\" Chamberlin said. The job market has been rough for both employers and professionals as widespread layoffs dominate headlines and professionals face intense competition for jobs. Over 1 million job cuts were announced in the U.S. in 2025, the highest level since the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020, according to data from consulting firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas. Meanwhile, the number of applications per role have skyrocketed, making it difficult for employers to respond quickly to applications. In fact, new Linkedin research finds that U.S. applicants per open role have doubled since the spring of 2022.Chamberlin said this is creating an overwhelming cycle in the job market that is difficult for both job seekers and recruiters to handle. \"The job search is tougher right now, because what we are seeing is that there's such a high volume of applications for each role that there is available. So, if I'm a job seeker, I'm applying to lots of roles. On the flip side, there's companies recruiters who are receiving lots of applications.\"Companies are finding it hard to filter through these applications quickly enough to find people with the right skill set for the jobs that they're hiring for. And the job seeker on the other side of that is waiting to hear back from companies whilst getting increasingly anxious because they might not be hearing back,\" Chamberlin said. The anxious job seeker then goes and applies to more roles to increase their chances of getting a job, continuing the cycle. Chamberlin says AI is a \"big part of the solution,\" with 93% of recruiters planning to increase their use of AI in 2026, per the LinkedIn research. Avoid sending generic applications The start of the new year typically brings an influx of new job openings and motivated job seekers. However, as AI becomes central to hiring, many professionals are rethinking how to navigate the job market. LinkedIn's global research, which surveyed 19,000 respondents globally, including from the U.K, U.S., France, Germany and Australia, found that 80% of workers feel unprepared for the job hunt in 2026 and nearly two-thirds feel that the job search has become more challenging. Chamberlin advised tailoring applications and to avoid mass-applying with generic cover letters, as AI is now often the first to review a job application. It's important to \"be targeted\" when crafting your resume and cover letter. \"Applying for roles that genuinely match your skills will always outperform sending lots of generic applications, for both AI and for humans,\" she said. Chamberlin said that using AI can help make your application more succinct as it can identify where you're not highlighting the skills you need for a particular job.\"In an AI-driven job market, clarity is key,\" she said. \"If you can make sure that your skills are highlighted very clearly on your resume, on the cover letter, on your LinkedIn profile, naturally, I think that's what's really going to help you stand out.\"Finally, Chamberlin suggested prioritizing simple formats and to avoid overly stylistic templates as it can be confusing to read for AI.",

    "body": "Nearly a million young British people, between the ages of 16 and 24, were not in education, employment or training at the end of 2025, per the U.K. Office for National Statistics.Hiraman | E+ | Getty ImagesYoung people are struggling to score their first jobs, and it might be because they're just not ready to enter the workforce, after missing out on critical social development during the Covid-19 pandemic. Joblessness in Generation Z is on the rise as nearly one million young British people, between the ages of 16 and 24, were NEETs (not in education, employment, or training), between July and September 2025, according to the U.K. Office for National Statistics. Identified as a crisis, the government launched an independent review into NEETs in December, led by former Labour Health Secretary Alan Milburn. Worryingly, the ONS report found that almost 600,000 of those young people who were unemployed were also not actively looking for a job. Young people are facing several challenges in the job market, from artificial intelligence eliminating entry-level positions to increased competition for jobs. More than 1.2 million applications were submitted for just 17,000 graduate roles in the U.K. last year, per The U.K.'s Institute for Student Employers. Meanwhile, the number of job openings have decreased nearly 10% on the year to 729,000 in the September to November period from a year ago, the ONS found. There were 2.5 unemployed people per vacancy between August and October, up from 1.8 the previous year. It's not just the economic climate, with employers and experts saying that Gen Z are not adequately prepared to join the workforce. Milburn told The Times in a recent interview that employers find that young people \"aren't work ready\" when they enter full-time jobs after school. \"Young people don't necessarily have work experience, and what they have learnt at school isn't necessarily pertinent for the world of work.\" Generation Lockdown U.K.-based charity Shaw Trust helps people find employment and is working to end the NEETs crisis. Chief Impact Officer Julie Leonard broke down how virtual learning and being at home during the 2020 lockdown created a socialization gap in Gen Z, particularly between the ages of 20 and 24, in an interview with CNBC Make It. \"You've got a lot of young people who missed out on years of in person, education, work experience, work readiness, soft skills, and who now find themselves adults and in a very difficult job market, and also in a recruitment landscape that has completely changed over the years,\" Leonard said. Soft skills like learning to lead a team, collaboration, following instructions are \"so core to being work-ready,\" and Gen Z \"missed out.\"Many young people weren't forced to get out of their comfort zone at home, which includes talking to strangers, showing up on time for school or work, she added. MP Milburn explained that young people can't be blamed for not being ready to work and said opportunities for young people are in \"sharp decline.\" \"There's been a longstanding decline in 16 and 17-year-olds getting Saturday jobs,\" Milburn said, in comments reported by The Times. \"Previous generations, including mine, were all brought up where most of us had that type of job or had a paper round or whatever. That not only provided youngsters with the opportunity to earn but it also allowed teenagers to learn about what it meant to be in a workplace.Leonard says these part time jobs such as babysitting, gardening, or being on the paper route were \"critical\" to getting young people familiar with the discipline of work. \"We've lost that kind of stepping stone approach that is so critical,\" she said. In fact, employers at Big Four firms like KPMG and PWC have identified that their youngest recruits are lacking essential work etiquette skills like communication and collaboration. PWC started offering resilience training to toughen up its new graduate recruits in 2025 and pinned the lack of \"human-skills\" on the pandemic. In 2023, KPMG started offering soft skill sessions for young recruits including on teamwork and how to give presentations. Ask for jobs in-person Leonard recommends going back to old-school tactics to secure jobs, rather than sitting behind a screen and sending off an endless number of CVs that will eventually be rejected by AI.Indeed, now that job hunting has become primarily digital, many young people are sending off CVs written by AI. \"It's become so depersonalized, and they send off the email, they often get no response whatsoever, which is extremely demotivating,\" Leonard said. Walk into your local shop and ask for a job, advises Julie Leonard, chief impact officer at Shaw Trust. Timnewman | E+ | Getty Images\"Actually, what you do is you make a CV, you go down the high street, you have somebody walk with you and give you that resilience and that confidence to go and say 'I would like a job,'\" she advised saying that this is an exercize Shaw Trust advisors often carry out with young people. The kind of shop where this tactic might be most successful includes local mom-and-pop busineses, bars, cafes, or other small and medium enterprizes. \"You go in there with your CV, you have a conversation with a manager, you start to open doors. That's the type of work that we do. It's the hand holding, the resilience, the confidence building to step out. It's not sitting behind a laptop and just sending CVs,\" Leonard added. ",

Alex Wong | Getty ImagesU.S. President Donald Trump on Friday signed an executive order that aims to block the seizure of Venezuelan oil revenue held in U.S. Treasury accounts.The executive order states that the revenue, which is held in foreign government deposit funds, are \"held solely for sovereign purposes\" and that any court attempt to seize the funds will \"materially harm the national security and foreign policy\" of the U.S. The order, which declared a national emergency, said the funds are the sovereign property of Venezuela held in U.S. custody for governmental and diplomatic means, and are not assets subject to private claims. Any use of judicial process against the funds will interfere with efforts to \"ensure economic and political stability in Venezuela,\" the order says.Trump signed the order nearly one week after U.S. military forces captured Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, in Caracas. Both were indicted on drug-trafficking charges and have pleaded not guilty. Since the military operation, Trump has said that both nations \"are working well together\" on rebuilding Venezuela's oil and gas infrastructure and that American oil giants will invest at least $100 billion in the South American country.Trump met with major oil industry executives on Friday afternoon in an effort to get U.S. oil companies to invest in Venezuela. In that meeting, ExxonMobil CEO Darren Woods told Trump that right now Venezuela is \"uninvestable.\"ConocoPhillips and ExxonMobil exited Venezuela after its government, under President Hugo Chávez, nationalized the country's oil sector along with several other key industries. Both companies have filed arbitration cases against Venezuela seeking billions of dollars in compensation for assets that were expropriated by the government.Chevron is the only major U.S. oil company currently operating in Venezuela through a special license issued by the Trump administration.In his Friday order, Trump cited the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act and the 1976 National Emergencies Act as legal justification for safeguarding Venezuelan oil revenue in U.S. accounts. The White House did not immediately respond to a CNBC request for comment.",

    "body": "At the start of a new year, it's hard not to get swept up in the allure of New Year's resolutions: Setting goals you want to achieve or pinpointing the bad habits you want to break. For many people, breaking bad habits can be easier when you swap a not-so-great behavior out for a healthier option, Margaret Moore, founder of Wellcoaches Corporation, a school for coaches of healthcare and well-being experts, told CNBC Make It in 2023.Neuroscientist Anne-Laure Le Cunff, PhD, suggests trying \"tiny experiments\" with habits you'd like to introduce into your life instead of setting huge goals that can be unrealistic. It's significant to \"withhold judgment until you're done conducting your experiment,\" Le Cunff told CNBC Make It last week.In 2026, I'm simply looking to do less. My past few years have involved starting each day with a minimum of 10 items on my to-do list. This year I want to get that list down to five tasks, or less.I talked to my fellow CNBC Make It staff members about the bad habits they want to break this year and there were a few common themes. Here's what stood out.Screen time and tech\"A habit I would like to break this new year is waking up and reaching for my phone first thing in the morning. It's something that has been like muscle memory for such a long time now that I can't remember a time where I didn't wake up and immediately grab my phone and check messages or scroll on social media.\"\"I'd also like to do more mentally stimulating activities when I'm bored instead of just reaching for my phone or watching TV, or just doing things that aren't really challenging my mind in a way.\"— Ashton Jackson, Success Reporter\"I want to fix my sleep. I have not been sleeping right, and I want to fix that. I think I'm just not sleeping enough, and also being on a screen too much before bed. A lot of it is doom scrolling. My other thing is if I'm trying to read and wind down before bed, I read e-books and that screen issue has kind of been a thing too.\"— Sarah Jackson, Work Reporter\"I'm avoiding video games for January. So if I feel like going to play a video game, I play music or I'll read a book.\"— Mike Winters, Money Reporter'Revenge bedtime'Staying up late for extra free time, even when it cuts into the hours you'd otherwise use to sleep and feel rested the next day, is called revenge bedtime. \"It often happens when individuals feel they have little control over their daily schedules,\" according to the Sleep Foundation.\"I'm very bad about watching TV until like 12:30, so I want to have a harsh 'Get into bed,' no later than 11 [p.m.] And I think that will help me break a lot of other bad habits that I have. Like after work being too tired to be productive or do things, I think if I get my sleep on track, it will help with having energy to exercise or be productive after work.\"— Marisa Forziati, Video Editor\"Going to sleep earlier is a big one. It's just tough because with little kids, it's like after they go to sleep at 8' o clock then that feels like freedom. It's the push and pull of wanting to maximize that time with free time, but then also needing to go to sleep. Trying to find that balance of making space to unwind but also to get good rest.\"— Tom Huddleston Jr., Senior Success ReporterNo more abandoning healthy habits\"One habit that I want to stop doing is getting lazy about reading. That's like the hardest thing to force myself to do. I lowered my quota of books for the year to 10 from 12 because I was like maybe if it's 10, I'll actually do it.\"— Gili Malinsky, Lead Psychology Reporter\"Not skipping my workouts, eating sugar or pressing snooze. Trying to get up when the alarm goes off.\" — Kamaron McNair, Money Reporter\"Having less FOMO with my friends. Like if they're going out, I don't have to go this time. If I miss this one social plan, I'm not going to lose this friend, I don't think. I hope not. I have a hard time saying no to invitations to things.\"— Raffi Paul, Video Producer\"I'm trying to walk more. I take the train to work usually but if I can walk home, that adds a bunch of steps to my day.\"— Natalie Wu, Associate Money ReporterAs you look to break habits that don't suit you, Moore reminds you to leave some room for grace, especially if you're a very disciplined person.\"There's a part of you that needs to be free, and indulgent, and impulsive, and enjoy life,\" she said.And if you're struggling to keep up with the changes you're making to your routine, \"there's nothing inherently wrong with not being ready,\" Moore added. \"You're just not ready.

    "body": "watch nowThe U.S. labor market ended 2025 on a soft note, with job creation in December less than expected, according to a report Friday from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.Nonfarm payrolls rose a seasonally adjusted 50,000 for the month, lower than the downwardly revised 56,000 in November and short of the Dow Jones estimate for 73,000. At the same time, the unemployment rate fell to 4.4%, compared with the forecast for 4.5%. A more encompassing measure that includes discouraged workers and those holding part-time jobs for economic reasons dropped to 8.4%, down 0.3 percentage point from November. The household survey, which is used to calculate the unemployment figures, showed an increase of 232,000 while the labor force participation rate edged lower to 62.4%.The report presented a muddy view of the labor market, with companies reporting a low level of hiring but households showing employment gains. Stock market futures gained following the release while Treasury yields were stable.In addition, revisions brought totals down for the prior months. The November total saw a slight downward revision of 8,000 to the payrolls number, while October's loss was even more than originally reported, now at 173,000 compared with the prior estimate of 105,000.For the full year, payroll gains averaged 49,000 a month, compared with 168,000 in 2024, according to the BLS.\"The jobs report is a mixed bag, with both positive and negative aspects,\" said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B. Riley Wealth. \"We continue to see an environment where companies are slow to hire and slow to fire. The overarching takeaway in today's report is that there is more good news than bad in the first on-time jobs report in three months.\"watch nowPrior reports had been delayed due to the government shutdown, which saw data collection and reports suspended during the 43-day impasse.Restaurant and bar jobs led the month, rising 27,000, while health care added 21,000 and social assistance increased by 17,000. Retail reported a decline of 25,000. Government added just 2,000 jobs for the month.Average hourly earnings rose 0.3% for the month, in line with the forecast, although the annual increase of 3.8% was 0.2 percentage point higher than expected. The average workweek edged lower to 34.2 hours.Federal Reserve officials have been watching the jobs picture closely for guidance on the future path of interest rates.The annual payrolls gain of 584,000 for 2025 is the worst year outside of a recession since 2003, according to Heather Long, chief economist at Navy Federal Credit Union.\"It's fair to say that 2025 was a hiring recession in the United States,\" Long wrote. \"The United States is experiencing a jobless boom where growth is strong, but hiring is not. It's a great scenario for Wall Street, but an uneasy feeling on Main Street.\"Despite some clamoring for additional rate cuts on top of the three the Fed approved in the latter part of last year, the economy looked in fairly solid shape as a tumultuous year came to a close.The Atlanta Fed's rolling measure of incoming economic data is pointing to gross domestic product increasing at a 5.4% annualized pace in the fourth quarter. That comes off a third quarter in which the broad growth measure rose at a 4.3% rate.In addition, consumers, who power two-thirds of the $31 trillion U.S. economy, spent heavily during the holiday season. Adobe estimates that online spending rose 6.8% from a year ago to a record-setting $257.8 billion.Markets expect the Fed to stay on hold for a period following the succession of cuts that began in September. The next reduction is not priced in until June, though that could change following the payrolls report.The report caps a tumultuous year for the BLS. President Donald Trump in August, angry over a weak payrolls report for July and large revisions to prior months, fired former Commissioner Erika McEntarfer and replaced her with William J. Wiatrowski. In addition, the shutdown posed data collection challenges for the bureau. Markets expect the January report will present a cleaner view of the labor picture.watch now",

    "body": "watch nowBlackRock came into 2026 with a clear investment plan built around three pillars: artificial intelligence, income, and diversification. Jay Jacobs, BlackRock's head of equity exchange-traded funds, laid out ways in which ETFs fit into the shifting market bets from the world's largest asset manager, which oversees more than $13 trillion from investors. Investors should remain focused on growth, he says, but precision will matter more than broad exposure.\"The first is really what are the biggest growth opportunities in the market today,\" Jacobs said on CNBC's \"ETF Edge\" on Monday. \"Where you have to get laser focused to try and find some of these targeted exposures, like artificial intelligence, that could do very well in this environment.\"That and the other investing themes Jacobs shared on \"ETF Edge\" are consistent with BlackRock's 2026 annual outlook, \"AI, income & diversifiers,\" which was released earlier this week.BlackRock continues to view AI as a long-term, capital intensive investment cycle. Infrastructure spending remains elevated, while productivity gains and earnings growth are backed by AI-related investments. The firm does not see the theme as nearing exhaustion.BlackRock is among the ETF companies offering AI-focused funds, such as its iShares A.I. Innovation and Tech Active ETF (BAI), which has amassed over $8 billion in assets. Stock Chart IconStock chart iconBAI 1YThere are many other AI ETF options that have grown to over $1 billion in assets in recent years:Roundhill Generative AI & Technology ETF (CHAT)Ark Autonomous Technology and Robotics ETF (ARKQ)Global X Robotics and Artificial Intelligence ETF (BOTZ)Global X Artificial Intelligence and Technology ETF (AIQ)iShares Future AI & Tech ETF (ARTY)Dan Ives Wedbush AI Revolution ETF (IVES)Jacobs cited the U.S. equity market's high level of concentration, with a handful of mega-cap tech stocks now accounting for an outsized share of returns, as among the reasons to fine-tune equities exposure. The \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks make up over 40% of the S&P 500 Index.\"[That concentration] is either a feature or a bug,\" Jacobs said. \"It's reaching historical levels.\"Jacobs said investors are responding by becoming more deliberate about how much concentration they want. Some are choosing to broaden their exposure by equal-weighting the U.S. stock market as a way to manage the risk.Jacobs cited the interest-rate environment, and expectations the Federal Reserve will lower rates again, as a reason to make income a major focus this year as the declining rates pressure yields on cash investments. Investors who relied on money markets for income may need to reposition. \"We are in a falling interest rate environment. We expect some cuts this year. We need to find new sources of income to diversify your portfolio and generate income from it,\" Jacobs said.Diversification is the third pillar of BlackRock's 2026 approach to the market. Bouts of volatility are becoming more frequent while market leadership is narrow, and traditional portfolio design that rely on bonds to smooth out the risks from stocks — typically the so-called 60-40 portfolio — are proving less reliable during periods of stress. As a result, Jacobs said investors are looking for assets that behave differently. \"Where can you really get diversification for your portfolio?\" he said. \"Something that's going to behave differently from stocks and bonds.\"The underlying message from Jacobs was that investors have been very fortunate over the past decade with a U.S. stock market that has produced significant returns, but it would be risky to expect that run to continue at a similar pace. \"The last 10 years, the S&P 500 has an annualized return of 13.5%, and many expect it to be lower,\" he said.",

    "body": "Jeff Greenberg | Universal Images Group | Getty ImagesCompany: Lululemon Athletica Inc. (LULU)Business: Lululemon Athletica is a technical athletic apparel, footwear, and accessories company. The company organizes its operations into four regional markets: the Americas, China Mainland, Asia Pacific (APAC), and Europe and the Middle East (EMEA). It conducts its business through different channels in each market, including the company-operated stores, e-commerce, temporary locations, wholesale, outlets, a re-commerce program, as well as license and supply arrangements. The company offers a comprehensive line of technical athletic apparel, footwear and accessories marketed under the lululemon brand. Its apparel assortment includes items such as shorts, tops and jackets designed for a healthy lifestyle, including athletic activities such as yoga, running, training and most other activities. It also offers apparel designed for being on the move and fitness-inspired accessories. It operates stores in the United States, Canada, China Mainland, Australia, South Korea and others.Stock Market Value: $23.92B ($203.90 per share) Stock Chart IconStock chart iconLululemon Athletica shares in the past 12 monthsActivist: Elliott Investment ManagementOwnership: n/aAverage Cost: n/aActivist Commentary: Elliott is a multi-strategy investment firm that manages approximately $76.1 billion in assets (as of June 30) and is one of the oldest firms of its type under continuous management. Known for its extensive due diligence and resources, Elliott regularly follows companies for years before making an investment. Elliott is the most active of activist investors, engaging with companies across industries and multiple geographies.What's happeningOn Dec. 18, it was reported that Elliott has taken a more than $1 billion position in Lululemon and is bringing in Jane Nielsen, former CFO and COO of Ralph Lauren, as a potential CEO candidate at the company.Behind the scenesLululemon is a global athletic apparel, footwear, and accessories company, offering pants, shorts, tops, and jackets for activities such as yoga, running and training. While the company remains anchored in its core North America market (~70% of revenue), it has built a significant presence in APAC (~25%), and China specifically (18%), as well as Europe (~5%). In fact, these ancillary markets have grown quite rapidly, with APAC and Europe delivering average compound annual growth rates of 33% and 22% respectively, over the past year. This international expansion has helped drive strong overall topline growth, with sales growing from $8 billion in 2023 to $11.9 billion today. However, in that same period, the company's share price has gone down from over $500 to now below $220 per share. The problem here lies in North America. Growth in this core market has slowed to low single digits, and now has turned negative, with comparable sales down 5% in the most recent quarter. Further, while the China growth story resonated with investors when North America was showing continued expansion, this narrative on its own in the face of North American core uncertainty is not something that is very appetizing to public market investors. The root challenges in the North America business can be traced back to 2018, when Calvin McDonald became Lululemon CEO. From the beginning of his tenure, and through the post-Covid period, the company operated in a golden era for athleisure, benefiting from the broad casualization of apparel and enjoying years of outsized growth as the only real large-scale player. While this environment delivered years of share price appreciation, it also masked a series of strategic missteps that would later come back to bite them. First, Lululemon used much of these earnings to pursue new business lines, including its $500 million acquisition of Mirror, as well as the launches of footwear and skincare lines, none of which have generated meaningful shareholder value. Moreover, while these initiatives may have been tolerable on their own during a period of rapid growth, they ultimately distracted management from the core North America business that was key to revenue growth. This loss of focus became especially pronounced in May 2024, when the company's chief product officer resigned. Since then, product direction and design have widely been perceived to be largely centralized under McDonald. Lululemon has shifted from its historically sleek and highly functional aesthetic toward louder branding and collaborations, such as with Disney, that are not aligned with the core customer. As a result, the company's brand perception has shifted, allowing competitors like Alo and Vuori to gain momentum and begin taking share, particular among Lululemon's core customer base of young women. This is a dynamic that is evident to anybody who shops in the category. While store traffic and brand awareness remain high, conversion has deteriorated. These product missteps have been further compounded by broader operational issues in the areas of marketing, supply chain and corporate cost controls. Together, these issues have driven margin pressure, eroded brand momentum in North America, and ultimately contributed to the sharp decline in the company's stock price. On Dec. 11, 2025, Lululemon announced that McDonald would step down as CEO effective Jan. 31, 2026. This impending leadership transition is what set the stage for Elliott to disclose a more than $1 billion position in Lululemon and bring in Jane Nielsen, former CFO and COO of Ralph Lauren, as a potential CEO candidate at the company. Lululemon is still a quality product and brand that has somewhat lost its way and needs to be invigorated. It does not need a CEO who knows all the answers (if that exists) but one who will hire the best talent and institute the right processes so management can work as a team of marketers, merchandisers and product developers to come up with the solutions. At the same time by delegating these duties to competent senior executives, Nielsen will be able to also oversee the company's supply chain and corporate structure to solve the problems there and institute a cost discipline that has been absent. This is what Nielsen has experience doing at both Ralph Lauren and Coach. In 2014, when Nielsen was at Coach, the manufacturer of luxury handbags was losing out to rivals and announced that it expected same-store sales in North America to be down by a high-teens percentage in the coming year. Nielsen told investors that Coach would be back to profitability within two years. Nielsen helped Coach close underperforming stores and get inventory under control and by March 2016, the Coach brand posted its first quarterly sales increase in North America in nearly three years. When Nielsen joined Ralph Lauren in September 2016, sales had stalled and net income had fallen approximately 50% since 2014. In a 2024 article in The Wall Street Journal, Nielsen was quoted as saying, \"The brand was bigger and better than the business was showing\" — which is similar to Lululemon today. Nielsen and the leadership team targeted millennial and Gen Z shoppers and overhauled the website and closed stores, leading to an increase of 20% in adjusted operating income.When an activist comes to a company with an idea or recommendation, they are just as happy if the company takes that recommendation or comes up with a better one. Elliott is not saying that Jane Nielsen is the best person for the job. The firm is saying that she is the best person it knows of for the job, and the firm does extensive and comprehensive diligence and analysis before making a recommendation like this. Elliott cannot name the next CEO. The board does that. And while Elliott would like to see Nielsen as the next CEO, if the board decides on someone else who is equally qualified, Elliott will support that decision. In practicality, whoever the next CEO is will be pseudo-approved by Elliott because we have never seen a qualified CEO with options take a job like this if they knew an activist like Elliott opposed his or her appointment. But Elliott's presence alone adds a lot of value to the situation which the board should recognize. First, it justifies a sense of urgency, which is needed here. Second, the firm brings to the table a more than qualified CEO candidate who is ready and willing to take on this role. Third, an activist of Elliott's stature and reputation can give the board cover in whatever decision they make. This third point is particularly important when there is an outspoken founder in the wings like Chip Wilson who has been publicly criticizing board decisions. Without the activist, even a competent and experienced board could compromise on the CEO selection to appease the vocal founder. This is very similar to Elliott's recent campaign at Starbucks, another iconic brand facing popularity, competition and image challenges with an outspoken founder not afraid to give his opinion. At Starbucks, Elliott's efforts quickly culminated in the appointment of Brian Niccol as CEO, now working to reset the company's strategy and restore investor confidence. Elliott's presence justified the urgency required and its endorsement of Niccol gave the board the external credibility to act quickly.Since Elliott engaged Lululemon, on Dec. 29, Chip Wilson has nominated three directors – Marc Maurer, the former co-CEO of On Holding AG; Laura Gentile, former chief marketing officer of ESPN; and Eric Hirshberg, former CEO of Activision, the largest segment of Activision Blizzard – for election to the board at the 2026 annual meeting.Ken Squire is the founder and president of 13D Monitor, an institutional research service on shareholder activism, and the founder and portfolio manager of the 13D Activist Fund, a mutual fund that invests in a portfolio of activist investments.",

    "body": "A cargo ship sits in New York Harbor on Nov. 19, 2025 in New York City. Spencer Plat | Getty ImagesThe Supreme Court did not rule Friday on the legality of broad tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump, leaving markets still awaiting a decision poised to have far-reaching impacts on trade policy and the U.S. fiscal situation.There had been speculation that the tariff ruling would be issued on Friday, but the Supreme Court released just one opinion for the day, and it was unrelated to tariffs.It is unclear when the tariff ruling will be released. The court will release its next rulings Wednesday.When it does come, the decision will address two issues: whether the administration can use provisions under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to levy the tariffs, and if it isn't proper, if the U.S. will have to reimburse those importers who already have paid the duties.However, the final decision could also fall somewhere in between.The court has the option to grant limited powers under the IEEPA and require only limited repayment, along with multiple other options for how it handles a touchy matter that is being closely watched on Wall Street.Moreover, even should the White House lose the case, it has other tools in its chest to implement tariffs that don't require the emergency powers cited under the act.Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent himself said Thursday he expects a \"mishmash\" ruling.\"What is not in doubt is our ability to continue collecting tariffs at roughly the same level, in terms of overall revenues,\" Bessent said during an appearance in Minneapolis. \"What is in doubt, and it's a real shame for the American people, was the president loses flexibility to use tariffs both for national security, for negotiating leverage.\"Trump used the IEEPA in part as an emergency measure to stop the inflow of fentanyl to the U.S. The impact of losingLosing the tariffs would have multiple ramifications, said Jose Torres, senior economist at Interactive Brokers.\"If the court blocks the tariffs, the administration is going to find workarounds,\" Torres said. \"President Trump is very ambitious in getting this agenda through despite potential controversies that could surround such a decision.\"\"Blocking tariffs would be bad for onshoring ambitions. It would be bad for fiscal conditions, rates would go higher,\" he added. \"But it would be good for corporate earnings. Input prices would be lower and trade would be smoother.\"Administration officials have cited a number of options to offset the court's decision should it not go their way. Prediction markets site Kalshi is pointing to just a 28% probability that the court will rule in favor of the tariffs as implemented. Torres said his firm's clients have a similar expectation. Bessent has said that the administration has at least three other options through the 1962 Trade Act that will keep most of the tariffs in place. However, he also has worried that reimbursements could place a strain on the administration and its effort to drive down the fiscal deficit. Tariffs brought in some $195 billion in fiscal 2025 and another $62 billion in 2026, according to Treasury data.Ultimately, Morgan Stanley analysts \"see significant room for nuance\" in the Supreme Court decision. The court \"has wide latitude when it comes to issuing decisions, a range of outcomes is possible, like the Court narrowing the scope of existing tariffs but not mandating their full removal or limiting the future application of tariffs,\" Morgan Stanley analysts Ariana Salvatore and Bradley Tian said in a note.\"We do think there's scope for the administration to take a lighter-touch approach to the overall tariff regime given a recent political focus on affordability,\" they added.The tariff impact thus far has defied analyst projections: There's been a limited impact on inflation, while the trade deficit has plunged, countering expectations in some quarters that the tariffs could make the U.S. a pariah on the global trading stage. The trade imbalance for October hit its lowest level since the end of the financial crisis in 2009, at a time when imports had declined sharply due to the massive recession the crisis generated.",

    "body": "FILE PHOTO: U.S. President Donald Trump looks on as he signs executive orders and proclamations in the Oval Office at the White House, in Washington, D.C., U.S., May 5, 2025. Leah Millis | ReutersPresident Donald Trump's attack on Venezuela and threats to other countries, as well as concerns about affordability, exposed fractures within the congressional GOP this week at the start of a challenging midterm election year.Trump avoided defeat when most House Republicans declined to override the first of two vetoes of his presidency, which spiked a pair of nonpartisan infrastructure bills that would've benefited Colorado and Florida.But it was otherwise a less-than-stellar week for Trump on Capitol Hill, though Republicans are projecting confidence.\"This isn't an unusual situation, particularly coming into midterm elections, where you have senators that are in tough situations,\" Sen. Bill Hagerty, R-Tenn., said Friday on CNBC's \"Squawk Box.\"A senior White House official said the defectors represent just a \"tiny fraction\" of congressional Republicans.\"Republicans aren't always going to have the same views as the president,\" the White House official said.Read more CNBC politics coverageNew cellphone video of Minneapolis ICE shooting incident revealedIran's leader accuses protesters of acting for TrumpTrump suggests U.S. military will hit cartels on 'land' in MexicoPortland: Border Patrol agent shoots 2 after ICE killing in MinneapolisTrump 'instructing' his 'Representatives' to buy $200B in mortgage bondsEpstein files: Reps ask judge to appoint special master for document releaseStill, cracks in GOP unity emerged on multiple fronts.On Thursday, 17 House Republicans broke ranks and voted with Democrats on legislation to extend enhanced Affordable Care Act tax credits for three years, despite opposition from House Speaker Mike Johnson of Louisiana and the widespread unpopularity of the Obamacare subsidies within the Republican party. The White House official said Trump opposes a three-year extension, but the vote was not viewed internally as a defeat.The enhanced tax credits were first enacted under President Joe Biden in 2021 and have been a focal point of Democratic messaging on health care and affordability. The credits expired at the end of 2025, resulting in sharply higher premiums for millions of Americans who get their health insurance on ACA marketplaces.Many of those who supported the bill to extend the tax credits were among the most vulnerable Republicans in the 2026 midterms.\"I have long opposed the damage the Unaffordable Care Act has done to our country, but I will not watch Wisconsinites lose health care because Democrats let their own law collapse,\" Rep. Derrick Van Orden, R-Wis., who voted for their extension, posted on X. Van Orden is running for reelection in a toss up district, according to Cook Political Report.Earlier on Thursday, five Senate Republicans bucked the president and joined Democrats on a procedural vote that could rein in his ability to take military action in Venezuela. Trump responded in a Truth Social post that \"Republicans should be ashamed\" of the senators who supported the preliminary vote and said they \"should never be elected to office again.\"Sen. Todd Young, R-Ind., one of the members called out by Trump, declined to comment on the president's comments on Thursday. When asked if he was open to changing his stance on subsequent War Powers votes, Young told reporters, \"Why would I?\"The White House, however, said there is a \"significant\" chance future votes on the resolution might go the president's way.\"A number of these members have left the door open to additional conversations,\" the senior official said.Meanwhile, Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., who is retiring at the end of his term in January 2027, has found himself at odds with the administration on several fronts. On Wednesday, Tillis took aim at White House senior adviser Stephen Miller from the Senate floor, calling Miller's comments about the U.S. taking over Greenland \"amateurish\" and \"stupid.\" The White House official called those remarks \"disappointing.\"A day after U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents killed a civilian in Minnesota, Tillis also announced he was blocking all Department of Homeland Security nominees. Tillis, however, said the hold was not related to the shooting, and instead had to do with Trump's Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem so far refusing to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee.\"All I'm saying is, you need to show respect to a committee of jurisdiction,\" Tillis told reporters this week.And on Thursday, Tillis and Sen. Jeff Merkley, D-Ore., secured passage of a resolution to place a plaque honoring police officers who defended the Capitol on Jan. 6 in the Senate. Language authorizing the plaque was passed into law as part of a larger appropriations bill in 2022. The monument was supposed to be displayed on the West front of the Capitol by March 2023, but had been blocked by House Republicans.Trump and his Republican allies in Congress have sought to shift the narrative on Jan. 6. On the five-year anniversary this week, the White House launched a web page casting blame on Democrats, then-Vice President Mike Pence, and Capitol Police for the violence that transpired that day.Officers \"risked their lives to defend the United States Capitol and protect members of Congress. Their brave actions upheld the rule of law and ensured that our democratic institutions could continue to function as intended,\" Tillis said in a statement. When asked about the plaque, the White House official said, \"The administration doesn't have a position on the decorations of the Capitol.\"",

    "body": "SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman attend an event to pitch AI for businesses in Tokyo, Japan Feb. 3, 2025.Kim Kyung-Hoon | ReutersOpenAI and SoftBank announced plans to invest $1 billion in SB Energy as part of a strategic partnership that will support OpenAI's artificial intelligence infrastructure buildout.The partnership is part of the $500 billion Stargate commitment that OpenAI, SoftBank and Oracle announced last January at the White House, according to a Friday release. As part of the agreement, SB Energy will build and operate OpenAI's 1.2 gigawatt data center site in Milam County, Texas that was announced in September. \"Partnering with SB Energy brings together their strength in data center infrastructure and energy development and OpenAI's deep domain expertise in data center engineering,\" Greg Brockman, OpenAI's president, said in a statement on Friday. \"The result is a fast, reliable way to scale compute through large, highly optimized AI data centers.\"SB Energy is backed by SoftBank and Ares Management. The company develops, owns and operates  energy projects across the U.S. It has offices in Redwood City, California, San Diego and Denver, according to its website. In addition to the investment, SB Energy has also formed a non-exclusive preferred partnership with OpenAI and SoftBank to develop \"a new model for data center builds,\" according to the release. That model will combine OpenAI's first-party data center design with SB Energy's \"proven expertise in speed, cost discipline, and integrated energy delivery,\" the companies said.The company has several multi-gigawatt data center campuses in development, and initial facilities are under construction and expected to enter service this year, the release said. SoftBank, led by Masayoshi Son, and OpenAI have become increasingly intertwined over the past year. Two months after the Stargate project was announced, OpenAI said it closed a $40 billion financing round led by SoftBank, the largest private tech funding on record. The round included participation from core investor Microsoft, as well as Coatue, Altimeter and Thrive.SoftBank said in November that it's sold its entire stake in chipmaker Nvidia for $5.83 billion as it looks to capitalize on its \"all in\" bet on OpenAI.The ChatGPT maker is burning through mounds of cash, and is still far from profitability, meaning it remains heavily reliant on outside capital.OpenAI has inked more than $1.4 trillion of infrastructure deals in recent months to try and build out the data centers it says are needed to meet growing demand. In November, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said the company was on track to generate more than $20 billion in annualized revenue run rate in 2025, with plans to grow to hundreds of billions in sales by 2030.WATCH: Judge rules Elon Musk’s lawsuit over OpenAI for-profit conversion can head to trialwatch now",

    "body": "In a photo illustration, prescription drugs are seen next to a pill bottle on July 23, 2024 in New York.Spencer Platt | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesA coalition of patient advocacy groups is urging a federal court to halt the practices of third-party companies that buy drugs from countries outside the FDA-regulated U.S. supply chain, which the groups argue put U.S. patients' health at risk.The court filing comes in the wake of a CNBC investigation that documented how these third-parties — commonly referred to as alternative funding programs, or AFPs — have spread across employer-sponsored health plans nationwide. Under the growing business model, AFPs source high-cost specialty drugs from abroad at lower prices and charge employers a fee or a percentage of the savings. The AFPs then provide the medication to patients at little or no cost. AFPs are especially appealing to small employers like local school districts, county governments and others who pay their staff's health-care costs out of pocket. But there's a trade off: Federal officials at the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and the Food and Drug Administration told CNBC that these medications are illegally imported and put patients' lives at risk. A Homeland Security Investigations official last year told CNBC that criminal investigations into AFPs were ongoing.The filing in a U.S. Court of Appeals in Maryland, dated Dec. 26, was led by the HIV+Hepatitis Policy Institute, a nonprofit that advocates for safe and affordable treatment for people living with HIV and viral hepatitis. \"Forcing a person who has employer-sponsored health insurance to sign up with an unknown third-party vendor to receive their life-saving drug supplied by a foreign country not only is illegal but jeopardizes the health and safety of patients,\" wrote Carl Schmid, executive director of the HIV+Hepatitis Policy Institute, in a press release. \"While federal regulators should be shutting them down, in the meantime, the courts must step in to protect patients.\" watch nowIn the court filing, the patient groups said the arrangements can delay treatment, confuse patients and expose them to drugs that differ from those distributed through the tightly regulated U.S. system. They warned that patients with chronic and life-threatening illnesses should not be forced to trade the safety and certainty of approved U.S. supply chains for lower costs to employers.The amicus brief filing was submitted in a case brought by Gilead Sciences after the company learned that an HIV patient received Gilead medication with labeling written in Turkish. Gilead alleges the drug traveled through an unsecured supply chain that does not comply with U.S. law. Turkey is a known hotbed for counterfeit drugs, according to U.S. officials.Gilead sued several companies involved in administering employer health plans, including the alternative funding program Rx Valet.Greg Santulli, the CEO of the Georgia-based AFP, told CNBC last year that he's confident in the safety of the medications his company sources, adding that Turkey is a \"modern, sophisticated country\" capable of tracking medications through its supply chain.The lawsuit also named Meritain Health, which managed the patient's employee health plan and is owned by CVS Health.A spokesperson for CVS Health told CNBC last year that it \"has long maintained a policy that it does not support programs for non-FDA-approved medications sourced from outside the United States and does not contract with companies to facilitate the importation of non-FDA-approved medications\" from overseas.A federal judge issued a preliminary injunction blocking all parties in the case from importing Gilead medications from overseas. The defendants are appealing the ruling, with Meritain arguing the injunction is not necessary and would adversely affect its business. Rx Valet in a court filing said the injunction undermines access to safe medications, adding that Gilead's HIV drug shipped from Turkey was the same as what is sold in the U.S. at a much higher cost.",

    "body": "Are we in an artificial intelligence bubble?It's the debate that dominated the tech industry in 2025, and it's not going away anytime soon.Record valuations and deals driven by major investments in artificial intelligence have fueled the AI boom, leaving some to brace for the potential burst.AI leaders like OpenAI and Nvidia have spun an impressive web of staggering deals with cloud infrastructure companies, while hyperscalers including Amazon, Microsoft and Google continue to spend billions on data center buildouts.Although companies are racing to supply the rapidly accelerating AI demand, the enormous debt financing these buildouts have sparked worry that the spending spree may prove to be an overreach.Economic bubbles occur when asset prices in a specific market rapidly rise, often due to speculation or overenthusiasm, followed by a crash when prices suddenly drop.Read more CNBC tech newsMeta faces China probe over acquisition of AI agent startup ManusMicrosoft revealed as company behind controversial data center proposal in Michigan townshipAlphabet's market cap surpasses Apple's for first time since 2019Google, Character.AI to settle suits involving minor suicides and AI chatbotsBubble talks ignited again at the end of last year after Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang dismissed fears of a possible AI bust during the company's third-quarter earnings call.\"There's been a lot of talk about an AI bubble,\" he said. \"From our vantage point, we see something very different.\"Others have been less confident in the stability of the AI surge, including \"The Big Short\" investor Michael Burry. The fund manager, who rose to fame for predicting the 2008 housing crisis, drew parallels between the current spending euphoria and the dot-com mania of the late 1990s in a lengthy Substack essay.\"Sometimes, we see bubbles,\" Burry wrote in an October X post. \"Sometimes, there is something to do about it. Sometimes, the only winning move is not to play.\"OpenAI CEO Sam Altman made a similar comparison during a dinner with reporters in August.\"Are we in a phase where investors as a whole are overexcited about AI? My opinion is yes. Is AI the most important thing to happen in a very long time? My opinion is also yes,\" he said.A note on methodology:CNBC compiled responses from 40 tech executives, analysts and other professionals in the space, who shared their thoughts over the past four months about the current AI frenzy.Although the question of whether or not the market is in a bubble seems binary, many answers have landed across a spectrum of bubble potential — and worry.To give each response a more rounded perspective, CNBC also weighed the level of concern.CNBC scored each person's remarks on a scale from 0 to 10 on two factors: How much they believe that AI is in a bubble (0 being no and 10 being yes) and how concerned they are about it (0 being not concerned at all and 10 being very concerned).",

    "body": "watch nowPresident Donald Trump in a social media post Thursday evening indirectly revealed data from Friday's market-moving nonfarm payrolls count, an apparent violation of long-standing federal policy on statistical releases.In a Truth Social post around 9 p.m. ET, the president indicated that private sector payrolls had expanded by 654,000 for the full year of 2025, a total that would have included Friday's jobs count for December. Office of Management and Budget policy prohibits executive branch officials from commenting on such releases early and in fact forbids public statements until 30 minutes after the release. Presidents can be briefed on official jobs figures ahead of the release.A White House official conceded, however, that \"there was an inadvertent public disclosure of aggregate data that was partially derived from pre-released information. The White House is accordingly reviewing protocols regarding economic data releases.\"The official further chided the media for \"grasping at straws to foment another fake controversy\" and instead urged a focus on how \"President Trump's policies are laying the groundwork for an economic resurgence as GDP and real wage growth continue to accelerate.\"The Trump post drew a distinction between private and government job growth, with the latter down 181,000 for 2025.Data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics' December jobs report, posted by U.S. President Donald Trump on his Truth Social account, about 12 hours before the figures were publicly released, is seen in this screenshot obtained on January 9, 2026. @realdonaldtrump | Via ReutersFriday's jobs data release went on to show that nonfarm payrolls increased 50,000 for December, all but 2,000 of which came from the private sector. The figures, while slightly less than official economists' estimates, assuaged concerns about a steeper drop in employment. Stock futures trended higher following the data.While Trump's post would not allow traders to calculate the exact payrolls figure because of lack of data on revisions, they could have gleaned a rough estimation of the figure and possibly ruled out a December job-loss scenario that would have spooked markets.Trump once telegraphed somewhat a positive jobs figure in his first term, drawing criticism.",

For many men, like Daniel Rankin, makeup has transformed from something taboo into a tool to make them look less tired and more put together.\"I remember thinking, 'Am I really doing this?'\" Rankin, a 24-year-old advertising agent from New York who likes to shop at Sephora, told CNBC. \"But once I tried it, it just became normal.\"In front of bathroom mirrors and in gym locker rooms, more men are now adding cosmetics to their routines, industry experts told CNBC. The men's makeup market is now one of the most lucrative — and largely untapped — growth opportunities left in beauty, and specialty retailers like Ulta Beauty and Sephora along with big-box companies like Target and Walmart all see opportunity. \"Men's beauty is one of the last categories left where brands can likely still see easy double-digit growth potential simply by showing up,\" said Delphine Horvath, professor of cosmetics and fragrance marketing at the Fashion Institute of Technology.

The global market was valued at $61.6 billion in 2024 and projected to surpass $85 billion by 2032, with the biggest growth driven by the skin-care sector, according to Fortune Business Insights.Much of the momentum is coming from Gen Z.In the U.S., 68% of Gen Z men ages 18 to 27 used facial skin-care products in 2024, a sharp jump from 42% just two years earlier, according to data from market intelligence firm Mintel.\"This is no longer niche,\" said Linda Dang, CEO of Canada-based Asian beauty retailer Sukoshi. \"Men are forming routines, that usually starts at skin care and then expands further, they are no longer just buying random products. That's what makes this market so valuable.\"Bloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesUnlike one-off grooming purchases, makeup encourages repeat use and experimentation. A man who starts with concealer often adds primer, setting powder or tinted SPF over time, said Farah Jemai, global marketing associate lead at beauty brand Unleashia. \"When men discover makeup that works, they don't use once and never again,\" Jemai told CNBC. \"They restock.\"Market researchers estimate that in 2022, about 15% of U.S. heterosexual men ages 18 to 65 were already using cosmetics and makeup, while another 17% said they would consider it, according to Ipsos. Industry experts say those figures are likely higher in 2026.Openness to cosmetics has grown, as the share of U.S. men who say they never wear makeup has fallen from more than 90% in 2019 to about 75% in 2024, Statista survey data show.Retailers cater to menBeauty conglomerates and startups alike are responding to the growth in men's beauty. Ulta Beauty and and Sephora have begun integrating men's complexion products into gender-neutral, skin care-first displays rather than having \"Men's\" aisles. Those gender-specific displays can feel intimidating or stigmatizing to some men, Horvath said.Big-box retailers like Walmart and Target have also expanded their men's cosmetics or grooming offerings.For example, in 2025, Target partnered with online streaming collective AMP, Any Means Possible, to launch TONE. The men‑forward personal care brand debuted in Target stores nationwide in July, leveraging AMP's massive Gen Z male following across YouTube and Twitch.Online — where much of the growth and discovery is happening — many beauty brands are pouring money into influencer partnerships to increase engagement and sales on TikTok Shop and Amazon.\"So many brands are now putting most of their marketing budget into influencer marketing to meet people where they already are online and make it easier to click 'buy,'\" said Janet Kim, a vice president at K-beauty brand Neogen.Others are leaning into digital education to teach men what different items do.The brand War Paint sells makeup products like concealer pens, tinted moisturizers and anti-shine powders that feature QR codes on the packaging. Scanning them launches video tutorials explaining what each product does — without forcing customers to ask questions in a store.\"The biggest barrier isn't price, it's uncertainty,\" Dang said. \"Men want to know what a product does and how to use it without feeling awkward.\"But the path to mass adoption isn't guaranteed. Industry analysts warn that social stigma remains high and inflation threatens to curb spending on experimental, nonessential goods. Retailers also face a steep learning curve: It is difficult to scale a market when the core customer doesn't know how to use the product.Target's SoHo store has an eye-catching \"Beauty Bar\" that shows off fragrances, makeup items and more.Courtesy of TargetThe emergence of men's makeupWhile men have worn makeup for centuries, from ancient Egypt to Elizabethan England, the modern commercial men's makeup movement traces its roots to the mid-2010s.In 2016, CoverGirl made history by appointing then 17-year-old YouTuber James Charles as its first-ever \"CoverBoy,\" placing a male face on a mass-market cosmetics brand for the first time.Still, beauty conglomerates largely focused on women until recently, Sukoshi's Dang said. Now, a broader cultural reset around masculinity is taking place and companies are racing to monetize it, FIT's Horvath said.Social media has been the single biggest accelerant, Dang said.On TikTok and Instagram, male creators post step-by-step makeup routines, product breakdowns and before-and-after results that often emphasize subtle changes rather than dramatic looks. Hashtags tied to men's grooming and makeup have amassed billions of views, with #mensgrooming alone surpassing 26 billion views on TikTok.\"TikTok democratized the 'how-to,'\" said Dang. \"You don't have to ask your sister or guess anymore. You just scroll, see a guy who looks like you fixing his acne in 30 seconds, and click 'buy.' It removed the gatekeepers.\"Gen Z men are also more comfortable rejecting rigid gender categories and more skeptical of marketing that frames products as inherently masculine or feminine, Horvath said.At the same time, makeup has increasingly been folded into a broader wellness and optimization culture — sometimes referred to as \"looksmaxxing\" — that includes fitness tracking, supplements, hair-loss prevention and longevity routines.\"Many men have started framing grooming and, for some, makeup as maintenance, not vanity,\" Horvath said. \"That reframing removes stigma and unlocks spending.\"Celebrity influence has further accelerated adoption, with stars like Harry Styles, Brad Pitt and Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson launching their own skin care and makeup brands, mirroring the trend of celebrity saturation largely seen in spirits.Johnson's brand Papatui, which launched at Target in 2024 and spans skin, hair, body and tattoo care, was created in response to ongoing questions about his grooming regimen. It now competes directly with legacy names like Clinique, L'Oréal and Kiehl's.CoverGirl James CharlesSource: COVERGIRL Moving aheadAs the market matures, a debate is forming: Do men want \"men's makeup,\" or do they just want makeup?Horvath said there is a \"bifurcation\" in how companies are marketing their products.Brands like War Paint and Stryx argue that men need products designed for their thicker, oilier skin, and packaged in masculine, tool-like containers that feel at home in a gym bag.But Gen Z consumers are increasingly gravitating toward gender-neutral brands like LVMH co-owned Fenty Beauty, The Ordinary and Haus Labs. For them, labels that say \"For Men\" can feel outdated or even patronizing, Horvath said. \"In ten years, I don't think we'll be talking about 'men's makeup' anymore,\" Horvath said. \"We will just be talking about makeup. The gender binary in beauty is dissolving, and the sales data is finally catching up to the culture.\"",

    "body": "Concept Ventures was an early investor in billion dollar AI firm Eleven Labs.Reece ChowdhuryA venture capitalist says one of the biggest reasons startups fail hinges on the relationship between co-founders.Reece Chowdhry, founding partner of Concept Ventures, said early teams often split within two years because their co-founders clash or lack a shared vision. His venture capital firm, founded in 2018, says it is Europe's largest pre-seed fund, which focuses on startups at the ideation stage. It recently announced it had raised $88 million for its newest fund.Chowdhry told CNBC Make It that he invests based on founders' personalities and traits before they even have a product. There are four to five key traits he looks for in a startup before going all-in, Chowdhry explained.\"I think 80% of our decision is on founders and we are typically the first investor in every company we invest in,\" Chowdhry said in the interview. \"The number one reason companies typically fail in the first 18 to 24 months is that founders fall out with each other or don't get along, don't have the same vision alignment, purpose, and so that is something that we think is really important,\" he said. In the initial meeting with founders, Chowdhry emphasized that co-founder chemistry is one of the key characteristics he looks for. \"One of the things we're very obsessed with is 'How well do you know each other? Have you gone through something meaningful in life? If I interview you both separately, will the answers also match? What will that person's strengths be? What will that person's weaknesses be? And do you intimately know each other?\"If I gave the New York Times' dating questions, would they match up to a level where you would really  intimately know people at their core?\"Other core traits that Chowdhry looks for in founders include an obsession with a specific field or industry, relentlessness and grit, a growth mindset, and evidence of exceptionalism in something outside of work, such as sports or chess. Concept Ventures was an early backer of $3 billion voice AI company Eleven Labs, co-founded in 2022 by Mati Staniszewski and Piotr Dąbkowski. Chowdhry said two key traits in his meeting with Eleven Labs' co-founders stood out and persuaded him to invest. \"The two things that stood out were domain obsession, so literally thinking about that problem for a long time and the team dynamics. They were like childhood friends. They knew each other super well. They complemented each other really well,\" he added. 'The whole package'Y-Combinator co-founder and startup guru Paul Graham shared similar wisdom in a blog. He warned that solo founders faced an uphill climb, noting that most successful startups have at least two or three founders. In one post, Graham wrote that a startup with only one founder is \"a vote of no confidence\" because it suggests they couldn't convince any of their friends to join.  However, failure is possible, even with multiple founders. \"The relationship between the founders has to be strong. They must genuinely like one another and work well together. Startups do to the relationship between the founders what a dog does to a sock: if it can be pulled apart, it will be,\" Graham said. Concept Venture's Chowdhry added that his investment decisions in early-stage startups involve examining \"the whole package,\" rather than just one founder.\"It has to be a package and I think what many VCs optimize for is they'll meet the CEO typically and they'll put a lot of lens on the CEO, although 50% of the business is two people or three people,\" he explained.He noted that many companies being built in Europe have very technical founders, but he looks for a founding team with complementary skill sets. \"It's not just technical and non-technical. Is one a very fast thinker, and the other ones are balancing them out. A slow thinker slows the other person down. Does one have magnetism, as in they can attract world-class talent to them,\" he added. ",

    "body": "Greg Hart, President and CEO of CourseraCourseraWith entry-level jobs declining as employers continue to deploy AI, Coursera's CEO has shared his top tips for graduates to stay competitive in the job market and stand out in interviews. Greg Hart, former technical advisor to Jeff Bezos at Amazon, became president and CEO of online learning platform Coursera in February 2025. He told CNBC Make It that in the age of AI, it's important for young people to pursue additional learning alongside a degree. \"The advice that I give to my sons... is one of the best things that you can do is to augment your university degree with micro credentials specifically,\" he said in the interview. Micro credentials are short courses that provide a certification for a specific skill or knowledge and they take less time to complete than a traditional degree or diploma. It's become increasingly important to supplement degrees with additional certifications, as graduate jobs are at risk of being replaced by AI, Hart said. Major firms have been laying off staff this year and have cited AI as part of the reason, from Amazon making 14,000 workers redundant as it bets on AI to Salesforce slashing 4,000 customer support roles saying AI can do 40% of the tasks at the company. \"Say you're a young person in university right now, you are generally going to get hired into your first job based primarily on the traits that they see in you.\"Greg HartPresident and CEO of CourseraMeanwhile, 62% of U.K. employers anticipate that junior, clerical, managerial and administrative roles will be the most likely be lost to AI, according to a recent survey of 2,019 senior HR professionals and decision makers by the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development (CIPD.)Additionally, the U.K.'s Institute for Student Employers found in its annual Student Recruitment Survey that 1.2 million applications were submitted for just 17,000 graduate roles, highlighting the intense competition and the limited positions available to young people. \"They [micro credentials] demonstrate to employers that not only did you get whatever university degree you're studying, but you augmented that with something that is generally much more workforce focused,\" Coursera's Hart added. As AI dominates, many workers are pursuing upskilling opportunities with LinkedIn's Skills on the Rise report, earlier this year finding that AI literacy was the most popular skill that people were adding to their profiles. 'Hiring you for your traits' Hart explained that fresh graduates going into job interviews should highlight their personality and character traits alongside their experience. \"Say you're a young person in university right now, you are generally going to get hired into your first job based primarily on the traits that they see in you,\" Hart said. \"They're going to be assessing your mindset and your traits as a human being more than your experience, because by definition, you really don't have much experience and so they're not really hiring you for your experience, they're hiring you for your... personality traits.\" Hart outlined that \"one of the most important traits\" that employers want to hire for are \"people who are proactive and hard working and take initiative, who prove to be ready, learners.\" The best way to show these traits is having micro credentials alongside your degree, especially ones that are tailored to your field. For example, Hart encouraged his son, who is a finance major, to take an additional course on AI for finance. In fact, experts previously told CNBC Make It that workers who have been laid off as a result of AI should train themselves up on new skills including increasing AI literacy via short courses, rather than pursuing a new degree which would be more costly and time consuming. Having the dedication to pursue additional learning demonstrates that you will also bring those traits to the job, they told CNBC. ",

    "body": "Despite a brief pandemic-induced recession, higher inflation and rising borrowing costs since 2020, the wealthy have gotten considerably wealthier.The threshold to be in the top 10% of U.S. households by net worth grew from about $1.3 million to roughly $1.8 million over the last five years, largely due to rising stock and home values, according to a recent Visa analysis of 2024 U.S. Census Bureau survey data. That figure reflects the value of what households own — homes, vehicles, savings, retirement accounts, investments and other assets — minus any debts.In absolute terms, households already in the top 10% by net worth saw their wealth grow more than any other cohort over the last five years, according to the Federal Reserve's distribution of wealth data.The income needed to be in the top 10% also increased, climbing from about $170,000 to roughly $210,000 over the same period, Visa's analysis shows. For comparison, the U.S. median income is $83,730 as of 2024, per U.S Census Bureau data.Visa defines \"affluent\" households as those who either earn at least $210,000 or have a net worth of about $1.8 million, a level that places them above 90% of U.S. households.About 12.2 million U.S. households qualify under that definition, and Gen X makes up 57% of them, compared with 12% for boomers, the analysis shows. Millennials and Gen Z together account for the remaining 31%.It may not be surprising that Gen X leads the affluent group, given they're in their peak earning years, while many boomers are retired.Most wealth gains came from rising home and stock valuesThe last five years were unusually good for households that already owned a home or had money in the market. Even through the Covid-19 pandemic and a spike in inflation, the job market stayed strong and consumers kept spending, which kept the economy on solid footing.Home prices surged beginning in 2020 on tight supply and cheaper mortgage rates, which stayed near historic lows until the Federal Reserve raised its benchmark interest rate in 2022, the first increase since December 2018.Major stock indexes also rebounded quickly from the early 2020 crash and went on to hit new highs, buoyed by a massive federal stimulus and a fast economic recovery, as measured by gross domestic product.Those trends pushed wealth up much faster than incomes. Paychecks rose, but at roughly half the pace. Between 2020 and 2024, the threshold for the top 10% of net worth grew about 40%, compared with about 23% for income, according to Visa's analysis.Broader indicators tell the same story: the U.S. median home price rose about 25% over the last five years, per U.S. Census data, and the S&P 500 gained roughly 109%.

    "body": "Ina Garten is an expert on making major career changes: she built a multimillion-dollar culinary empire after she quit her government job to open a food store.Garten's husband Jeffrey gave her sage advice when she decided to leave her previous career, she told Amy Poehler in a Nov. 25 episode of her podcast \"Good Hang with Amy Poehler.\"\"I said to Jeffrey, I really need to find something else to do. And he said, 'Just pick something fun. Pick something that you think you'd love doing, and if you love it, you'll be really good at it,'\" Garten said.She purchased her first store, Barefoot Contessa, in Westhampton Beach, New York in 1978.Managing her own store was difficult at first, Garten said. She had to \"learn very quickly how to be a boss,\" and she struggled to find her leadership style.\"A friend gave me the advice, your employees need two things from you. They need you to be clear, and they need you to be happy,\" Garten said. From then on, Garten practiced being more direct with her instructions – \"I need these candies bagged, and I need them wrapped up like this\" — and she resolved to not let her bad days \"disturb the energy in the room\" at the store. \"That was the best lesson I ever had for business,\" Garten recalled.How she delivers criticism Garten has a \"very clear\" rule about giving feedback to her employees: \"If I'm criticizing you, I'll take you out of the room and discuss what you can do better. If I'm complimenting you, I'll do it with everybody around.\"Though Garten tries to avoid firing people — \"I usually give them a lot of warning, explain what they have to do better,\" she said — sometimes the job just isn't the right fit. Learning how to let employees go was also a leadership skill Garten had to hone.A month into running Barefoot Contessa, Garten realized that one of her young employees was \"just dreadful\" at her job.\"She was just very sweet, but not very good,\" Garten said, so she decided to fire her.\"I took her out in the back and I explained that, you know, I'm sure there are other jobs that you're good at. This isn't the one,\" Garten told Poehler. Her delivery \"was so gentle, because I was so worried about hurting her feelings,\" Garten said, but she failed to get her point across to the employee.\"The next day she showed up for work again. She didn't know she was fired,\" Garten laughed. Garten didn't have the heart to attempt to fire the employee again, so she allowed her to stay on for the rest of the summer.Now, Garten has mastered the art of firing people in a kind, but firm manner: she said she fires people \"in a way that makes them say thank you and kiss me when they leave.\"Garten also prioritizes transparency as a leader. When Garten lets an employee go, she calls together the rest of her team to explain what happened, she said.She always worries that other employees will be upset with her for firing their colleague, she told Poehler, but \"100% of the time they're like, 'Oh, [they were] such a pain in the neck. We hated working with them. I'm so glad you fired them.'\"Black Friday sale: Want to up your AI skills and be more productive? Get 25% off our most popular course of the year, How to Use AI to Be More Successful at Work, with coupon code GETSMART.

    "body": "Before your child even steps out the door every day, their emotional baseline for the day is already set — not by color-coded routines, but by how safe and connected they feel in your presence.As a conscious parenting researcher, I've studied more than 200 kids, and I'm a mother myself. I've found that the happiest, most resilient kids are raised in homes where connection matters more than control, especially in the morning.Parents who raise happy kids practice nine morning rituals to create emotional safety and support their children's developing brain:1. Self-regulate before you reconnectBefore your child wakes up, take just 60 seconds to check in with yourself: Take a few deep breaths, a moment of stillness with your coffee, or a quick meditation.Children learn how to be calm directly through our nervous systems. When you begin in a regulated state, you provide a sturdy emotional foundation for your child's day.2. Lead with connection, not correctionBefore asking about teeth-brushing or backpacks, create a moment of genuine connection, like eye contact, a warm smile, or physical touch. Your message should be: \"You matter more than the morning rush.\"This brief emotional attunement regulates your child's nervous system and sets the stage for cooperation and calm.3. Create pockets of calm amid chaosIntegrate small rituals that slow the pace, like playing soft music during breakfast, sitting together without screens, or implementing a 30-second family huddle before heading out.These micro-moments teach kids that calm is available even on busy mornings.4. Find moments for laughterEven in the midst of spilled milk and mismatched socks, find opportunities for playfulness, like a silly voice, a 10-second dance party, or a shared inside joke.Laughter reduces stress and reinforces that mistakes or morning mishaps don't overpower emotional safety.5. Check in emotionally, not just logisticallyBefore diving into the day's logistics, pause to check in with how your child is feeling: \"How's your heart this morning?\" or \"What's one thing you're looking forward to today?\"These brief emotional check-ins build emotional literacy, which is one of the strongest predictors of lifelong resilience and happiness.6. Make physical touch non-negotiableA morning hug, a forehead kiss, or a moment of snuggling releases oxytocin and increases emotional security.Choose three specific moments in your morning routine where you'll pause for intentional physical connection and affection, regardless of how rushed you feel. It's one of the fastest, most effective ways to regulate a child's nervous system.7. Create a screen-free sanctuaryMake mornings a device-free zone for both parents and children for at least the first 20 minutes of waking. No phones, tablets, or television.This digital boundary creates space for natural conversation or even comfortable silence together. 8. Honor the power of slownessChildren live at a different pace than adults. That's just their biology. I recommend adding five extra minutes to one morning transition and match your child's pace.When we slow our movements and expectations, we help regulate their nervous systems. What looks like “dawdling” is often a child’s natural rhythm: their brain processing the world at a developmentally appropriate speed.9. Create a bridge before goodbyeInstead of rushing out with a quick \"Let's go,\" pause for a real goodbye: eye contact, a hug, reassurance.Then add a \"connection bridge,\" or something to look forward to later: \"I can't wait to hear about your science project tonight,\" or \"Let's make pancakes tomorrow morning.\"Let go of the idea that every morning needs to be rushed, or that the day is in shambles because they didn't finish their homework the night before. Focus on creating emotional safety. Even adopting one of these habits can help shift your child's entire day and support healthier brain development.Reem Raouda is a leading voice in conscious parenting and the creator of the BOUND and FOUNDATIONS journals, now offered together as her Holiday Emotional Safety Bundle.

These groups are expected to grow by 12.4% and 10.1%, respectively.One of the main reasons that the health-care industry is expected to grow so rapidly is because the American population is aging, according to Emily Krutsch, branch chief at the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\"That's really what's driving that trend: the older population tends to need more of this type of care and services,\" she says.Computer and mathematical roles will become increasingly important with the rise of AI technology, according to Krutsch.\"We are expecting a boost in employment growth for occupations that would be involved in developing and testing and implementing these types of tools,\" Krutsch says.Relatedly, information security analyst roles are projected to grow significantly due to the \"larger need to protect data and develop systems and tools to secure it,\" she says.Krutsch emphasizes that the growth rate for each job isn't the only important data point to consider.For example, wind turbine service technicians and solar photovoltaic installers are the two fastest-growing jobs, but both occupations combined will add under 20,000 jobs by 2034. \"Just because we're talking about fast growth doesn't necessarily translate to lots of jobs, because it could just be a very, very small occupation,\" Krutsch says.Based on the Bureau of Labor Statistics' data, these are the fastest-growing occupations for 2034, as well as the expected increase in jobs by 2034 and the current median salary for each role.1.

Michael Nagle | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesThe U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating Jefferies' relationship into bankrupt auto parts maker First Brands Group, The Financial Times reported Thursday. The newspaper, citing people with knowledge of the matter, said the regulator is looking into whether Jefferies gave investors enough information on its Point Bonita fund's exposure to the failed auto business. The inquiry into internal controls and potential conflicts within the bank is at an early stage, the report said. It's not clear whether it will result in any allegations of wrongdoing. Jefferies came under pressure last month after its exposure to First Brands — which collapsed under a series of complex debt agreements — raised fears of other bad loans on Wall Street.

Ben Montgomery | Getty Images Entertainment | Getty ImagesLONDON — European stocks started the last trading month of the year in negative territory.The Stoxx 600 began Monday in negative territory, with the pan-European benchmark down 0.44% shortly after the opening bell, with major bourses and sectors in the red.Regional markets had closed in positive territory on Friday, at the end of a choppy month for stocks as concerns over lofty AI valuations returned to the fore. Uncertainty over monetary policy also affected sentiment last month but investors are now expecting the U.S. Federal Reserve to trim interest rates when it meets on Dec. 9-10. Traders are pricing in an 87.4% chance of a quarter-point rate cut, according to the CME FedWatch Tool.Europe investors will be keeping a close eye on progress toward a peace deal for Ukraine this week as U.S' Special Envoy Steve Witkoff travels to Moscow for talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin and other Kremlin officials.The talks come after Ukraine said it approved in principle of a U.S.-backed 19-point peace plan. The plan is an amended version of an initial 28-point plan, devised secretly by the U.S. and Moscow, which appeared to favor Russia.Ukrainian and U.S. officials, led by U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, held more talks in Florida over the weekend. Rubio said the talks were \"very productive\" but that there was more work left to be done. Asia-Pacific markets kicked off December in mixed territory as traders assessed fresh manufacturing data from China, which showed China's factory activity unexpectedly contracted in November. Meanwhile, U.S. stock futures were little changed on Sunday night following a winning week, as traders prepared to wrap up a strong 2025.Seasonality is also on Wall Street's side. The S&P 500 averages an advance of more than 1% in December, making it the third-best month of the year for the benchmark in records going back to 1950, according to the Stock Trader's Almanac.There are no major earnings or data releases in Europe on Monday.— CNBC's Fred Imbert contributed reporting to this market report.",

    "body": "Cheng Xin | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesNovember has been quite volatile, with the high valuations of artificial intelligence stocks and expectations of an interest rate cut in December impacting investor sentiment. Those seeking stable income in this uncertain backdrop can consider strengthening their portfolios by adding some dividend paying stocks.Given the vast universe of dividend stocks, selecting the attractive ones could be challenging. In this regard, recommendations of top Wall Street analysts can help in decision-making, as their selection is based on in-depth analysis and thorough research.Here are three dividend-paying stocks, highlighted by Wall Street's top pros, as tracked by TipRanks, a platform that ranks analysts based on their past performance.MPLXMPLX (MPLX) is a master limited partnership that owns and operates midstream energy infrastructure and logistics assets and offers fuel distribution services. The company announced a third-quarter distribution of $1.0765 per common unit, reflecting a 12.5% year-over-year growth. At an annualized distribution of $4.31 per unit, MPLX offers a yield of 8.03%.In a recent research report, RBC Capital analyst Elvira Scotto reiterated a buy rating on MPLX stock and raised the price target to $60 from $58. In comparison, TipRanks' AI Analyst has an \"outperform\" rating on MPLX stock with a price target of $59.\"We continue to view MPLX as one of the most compelling income plays among large-cap MLPs with an attractive current yield of ~8% and plans to grow further,\" said Scotto.The top-rated analyst expects MPLX to deliver higher EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) growth from 2025 to 2026 compared to the prior year, driven by the scale-up of key projects like the Secretariat processing plant, the Titan sour gas treatment expansion, and the BANGL pipeline system.Additionally, Scotto is optimistic about MPLX delivering mid-single-digit EBITDA growth beyond 2026, driven by contributions from the Eiger pipeline and its Gulf Coast fractionation and export facilities, along with potential mergers and acquisitions. While Scotto slightly reduced her 2025 and 2026 adjusted EBITDA estimates following the Q3 results, she continues to expect MPLX to achieve its mid-single-digit annual growth target.Meanwhile, Scotto maintained her distribution per unit estimates and expects a 12.5% rise in 2026, followed by an incremental 12.5% hike in 2027, in line with the company's distribution growth target.Scotto ranks No. 333 among more than 10,100 analysts tracked by TipRanks. Her ratings have been profitable 64% of the time, delivering an average return of 11.4%.ConocoPhillipsAnother dividend-paying energy stock in this week's list is ConocoPhillips (COP). Earlier this month, the oil and gas exploration and production company announced an 8% hike in its fourth-quarter dividend to $0.84 per share, payable on December 1. COP stock offers a dividend yield of 3.65%. Following meetings with ConocoPhillips CEO Ryan Lance, Piper Sandler analyst Ryan Todd reiterated a buy rating on COP stock with a price target of $115. TipRanks' AI Analyst is also bullish on ConocoPhillips stock and has assigned an \"outperform\" rating with a price target of $96.\"In terms of resource depth and diversity, we see COP as better positioned than any company in our coverage universe,\" said Todd. He highlighted that ConocoPhillips has an industry-leading 22 years of drilling inventory, along with strong growth from LNG and U.S. conventional projects over the next four years. Todd contends that the market may still be underestimating COP's growth prospects beyond 2030, with massive growth potential across U.S. L48, Alaska, Norway, and Surmont and Montney in Canada.Todd is also impressed with ConocoPhillips' cost reduction efforts. He highlighted that COP has reduced adjusted operating costs by 8% or $900 million since 2024, with the 2026 outlook indicating another $400 million in cost reductions.Also, high-quality assets and lower costs are driving peer-leading free cash flow (FCF) growth for COP through 2030, with FCF/share estimated to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 12% from 2025 to 2030 at $70/bbl Brent, higher than the peer average of 8%. While investors worry that most growth comes after the contribution from the Willow project starts in 2029, Todd contends that near-term catalysts are likely underestimated. Todd estimates pre-Willow FCF/share to grow by 6% per year from 2025 to 2028, which still makes COP rank third among peers.Todd ranks No. 716 among more than 10,100 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been successful 58% of the time, delivering an average return of 8.4%. International Business MachinesFinally, we look at tech giant IBM (IBM), which returned $1.6 billion to shareholders in the third quarter via dividends. With a quarterly dividend of $1.68 per share (annualized dividend of $6.72 per share), IBM offers a yield of 2.22%.Following a meeting with the management, Evercore analyst Amit Daryanani reiterated a buy rating on IBM stock with a price target of $315. TipRanks' AI Analyst has an \"outperform\" rating on IBM stock with a price target of $349.Among the key takeaways, Daryanani highlighted that despite the uncertainties related to tariffs, interest rates, inflation, and geopolitics, management is optimistic about the broader macro backdrop and expects tech spending to be 2 to 3 points ahead of GDP growth. Over the medium term, IBM expects to sustain mid-single digit annual growth in its top line, driven by about 10% growth in the software business, better than-market growth in Consulting, and 1% to 3% increase in the Infrastructure segment revenue.The top-rated analyst also noted IBM's business transformation over the past five years, including the Red Hat acquisition and divestiture of GTS and other non-core assets. This transformation has helped IBM grow consistently with solid free cash flow and expansion in pre-tax income margin.Furthermore, Daryanani also discussed management's optimism about enterprise AI and a massive opportunity in the quantum space. \"We see multiple vectors for growth over the medium term,\" concluded Daryanani.Daryanani ranks No. 187 among more than 10,100 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been profitable 61% of the time, delivering an average return of 16.5%.",

    "body": "Disney's \"Zootopia 2\" follows detectives Judy Hopps and Nick Wilde find themselves on the twisting trail of a mysterious reptile who turns the mammal metropolis of Zootopia upside down.DisneyThe Thanksgiving box office had enough tasty options to deliver one of the best holiday performances ever.Led by Disney's \"Zootopia 2,\" which collected an estimated $156 million, the five-day Thanksgiving weekend secured around $294 million. That figure won't be finalized until Monday, when all of Sunday's ticket sales are calculated, but would represent either the third or fourth best Thanksgiving haul of all time.The fourth-highest Thanksgiving holiday box office is currently $291.3 million, which was generated in 2012 while the third-highest is 2013's $294.2 million haul, according to data from Comscore.While the 2025 Thanksgiving period at the box office was smaller than both 2018's $315.6 million haul and 2024's record-breaking $424.9 million, it still set records. IMAX reported its best five-day Thanksgiving holiday weekend ever with $40.8 million in global ticket sales, 70% higher than the previous record set during the same frame in 2024.\"'Zootopia 2' and 'Wicked: For Good' delivered a phenomenal one-two punch for the Thanksgiving holiday — hitting the sweet spot for family audiences and sending our global box office soaring well past expectations,\" Rich Gelfond, CEO of IMAX, said in a statement Sunday.Disney, too, hit several benchmarks.Largest animated box office ever \"Zootopia 2\" had the highest global opening of an animated movie of all time, with an estimated haul of $556 million. It is the fourth-highest global opening of all time, the company reported.\"A staggering global result for 'Zootopia 2' as the Disney brand coupled with a PG-rated family film extravaganza and a beloved original installment powered the film to over a half a billion dollars worldwide,\" said Paul Dergarabedian, head of marketplace trends at Comscore, told CNBC. \"This film truly cracked the code on what family audiences around the world [are] looking for when venturing out to cinemas.\"Additionally, the animated sequel posted the second-highest Thanksgiving day and Thanksgiving opening for both the five-day and three-day periods. The current record holder is 2024's \"Moana 2\" which tallied $221 million for the five-day Thanksgiving period and $135.5 million for the three-day.Universal's \"Wicked: For Good\" added an estimated $93 million to the domestic box office during the five-day Thanksgiving period, smaller than the $118 million \"Wicked\" picked up during the same period in 2024.Still, box office experts expected \"Wicked: For Good\" and \"Zootopia 2\" to continue to snap up ticket sales in the weeks before Christmas and ahead of the release of Disney's \"Avatar: Fire and Ash.\"\"This holiday weekend now sets the stage for a solid final home stretch of the box office year and with a great assortment of films on the way, including notable blockbusters and awards contenders ... this is a welcome result in the wake of what has been a very tumultuous post-summer season for the industry,\" Dergarabedian said.Disclosure: Comcast is the parent company of NBCUniversal, which owns CNBC. Versant would become the new parent company of CNBC upon Comcast's planned spinoff of Versant.",

US President Donald Trump said Thursday that Sarah Beckstrom, one of the two National Guard troops shot a day earlier near the White House, had died, while the other soldier was \"fighting for his life.\"Jim Watson | Afp | Getty ImagesU.S. President Donald Trump on Thursday announced sweeping plans to tighten immigration rules, including a suspension on migration from \"Third World Countries\" and cancellation of all federal benefits and subsidies to \"noncitizens\" in the country.In a pair of Truth Social posts late Thursday night, Trump said he would \"permanently pause migration from all Third World Countries to allow the U.S. system to fully recover,\" without specifying what would be considered a \"third world\" country. The term loosely referred to countries with higher poverty rates and economic instability.The president said he would also terminate \"millions\" of admissions under his predecessor Joe Biden and remove \"anyone who is not a net asset to the United States, or is incapable of loving our Country.\"Trump added he plans to end all federal benefits and subsidies for noncitizens, \"denaturalize migrants who undermine domestic tranquility,\" and deport any foreign national he described as a \"public charge, security risk, or non-compatible with Western Civilization.\"Read more CNBC politics coverageJudge dismisses James Comey and Letitia James cases over 'unlawful' prosecutor appointmentSen.

On average, these billionaires are worth $2.2 billion each.Despite Europe as a whole seeing a declinPhoto: Ingolf Pompe | LOOK-fotoSwitzerland has long been a haven for the ultra-rich. Its 300 wealthiest residents are worth a combined 850 billion Swiss Francs, or just over $1 trillion, according to business magazine Bilanz.So it was perhaps unsurprising that a new inheritance tax was resoundingly rejected by voters on Sunday. The proposal to tax every inheritance and gift of more than 50 million Swiss Francs at 50% was defeated with 78% voting against it. Powerful Swiss business lobby Economiesuisse called talk of the inheritance tax a \"superfluous and damaging discussion.\"It welcomed the proposal's defeat, saying: \"The threat of forced sales of companies and the resulting weakening of the business location have convinced those entitled to vote from all political camps.\"The proposal came from the youth wing of the country's left-wing Social Democrats. Money raised from the tax would have been earmarked to fund policies to combat climate change, with the party saying it would \"channel billions into climate protection every year while simultaneously combating extreme wealth inequality.\"watch now'The ultra wealthy are like queens on a chessboard'Before the vote, close followers of the debate told CNBC the initiative, first proposed in 2024, had already shaken wealthy individuals and family-owned companies. Swiss billionaire Peter Spuhler, founder and owner of Stadler Rail, had threatened to leave the country if the tax became law. He told Swiss daily Tagesanzeiger that his family would struggle to pay such a tax as their wealth is tied up in companies.\"A lot of people who would be affected talked to their consultants and their tax lawyers, and they did the paperwork to be sure that this time of the year, a week before the final vote, they are ready to move out if necessary,\" Stefan Legge, from the University of St. Gallen in Switzerland told CNBC on Friday.Legge, who conducted research into the potential impact of the tax, said: \"If you target the super wealthy, they are like queens on a chessboard.\" \"They are very mobile. They have tons of options to optimize their taxes,\" he added.Kurt Moosmann, president of the Swiss Single Family Office Association, told CNBC the proposal had caused \"a certain uncertainty among family offices and has kept foreign capital holders away from Switzerland.\"One potential impact of the 50% tax, if implemented, would have been a fall in tax revenue, according to  Legge. He said that around 2,000 people, or 0.3% of Switzerland's population, would be affected and they currently pay between 5 and 6 billion Swiss Francs a year.But although Switzerland faces competition from wealth centers in the Middle East and other countries in Europe, Legge said Switzerland was \"still very strong\" on \"finding the right balance between taxes and the right public services.\"watch nowGiorgio Pradelli, CEO of Swiss private bank EFG International, agreed that Switzerland remains in a strong position. \"If you look at the overall competitive landscape, Switzerland remains the No. 1 destination for international private banking and wealth management,\" he told CNBC last week. \"We have an ecosystem that is super healthy and strong.\"",

    "body": "Shoppers and pedestrians move through the Pitt Street Mall during a Black Friday sale on Nov. 28, 2025 in Sydney, Australia.Lisa Maree Williams | Getty ImagesThe emergence of AI shopping doesn't just give consumers access to personalized advice and hassle-free shopping, it also brings with it an increased risk of digital fraud.This Black Friday, for the first time, consumers and retailers alike are being warned about the perils of so-called \"agentic shopping,\" as consumers turn to large language models to search for products, compare offerings, receive personalized recommendations, and even make purchases without much human input. These technological advances come with their own risks.  \"It definitely makes my life easier… but at the same time, it also makes fraudsters' life substantially easier as well,\" said Michael Reitblat, CEO of Forter, an identity intelligence company that works on fraud prevention.According to Reitblat, there has been a 200% increase in agentic shopping by consumers over the past six months. That has been accompanied by a nearly tenfold increase in fraudsters using AI. \"Think of it as sending thousands of robots into different stores to masquerade as good consumers,\" Reitblat told CNBC's \"Squawk Box Europe.\"watch nowWhile some retailers' knee-jerk reaction has been to simply ban AI purchases, that could be a faulty strategy as more and more consumers use AI for shopping and that is driving good quality traffic, Reitblat said.A report by McKinsey & Company and The Business of Fashion found that among fashion executives, AI and digital tools were seen as the single biggest opportunity for the industry in 2026. To ensure products are visible and favored by AI models, brands must rethink marketing and e-commerce strategies, the report noted, adding that semantically rich data and API-accessible content will be critical to success.\"You need to use AI to fight AI,\" Reitblat said. \"You need to make sure that you're leveraging better data than fraudsters may have, and you need to properly think of: how do you authenticate the consumers?\"Shaky consumer confidenceValue-conscious consumers is another factor retailers have to deal with this year as heightened trade tensions and worries about a slowing economy impact consumers' spending habits.Consumer confidence has been shaky heading into the shopping season. In Europe, economic sentiment has remained stubbornly below its long-term average since mid-2022, according to data by the European Commission. Meanwhile in the U.S., consumer confidence hit its lowest point since April in November as concerns about job security mount.watch nowSome experts have suggested a split between wealthy consumers doing well and others that are cutting back on spending amid pressure from higher prices, in what has been dubbed the \"K-shaped economy.\"\"Consumer confidence has been bumpy, and therefore the customers feeling like they're getting genuine value is going to be a big thing for this year,\" said Curry's Chief Services Officer Dean Kramer. \"We know research is a big part of how consumers approach Black Friday, making sure they're getting absolute value.\"",

    "body": "Chinese-made automobiles and construction machinery are assembled and shipped for export at Yantai Port in Yantai City, Shandong Province, China, on October 21, 2025.  Costfoto | Nurphoto | Getty ImagesChina's factory activity unexpectedly contracted in November, according to a private survey released Monday, as soft domestic demand continued to cast a pall over the world's second-largest economy. The RatingDog China General Manufacturing PMI, conducted by S&P Global, dropped to 49.9 in November, missing analysts' expectations of 50.5 in a Reuters poll. A reading above the 50 benchmark level suggests an expansion, while one below that indicates contraction.  The private survey, which has typically painted a better picture than the official polls because it focuses on export-oriented manufacturers, signaled a slowdown from 51.2 in September and 50.6 in October. The official manufacturing PMI, released on Sunday, showed China's factory activity shrank for an eighth month in November, coming in at 49.2, although marking a modest improvement from 49.0 in the prior month.  The RatingDog private survey covers 650 manufacturers and collects responses in the second half of each month, while the official PMI surveys a larger sample of over 3,000 companies at month-end.  \"Manufacturing production growth came to a halt as new orders nearly stalled in November,\" S&P Global and RatingDog said in a statement, despite a notable recovery in new export orders, which expanded at the quickest pace in eight months. \"Manufacturers reduced their workforce and purchasing volume, and became more cautious in inventory management,\" said Yao Yu, founder of financial technology company RatingDog, amid a slowdown in new business growth.Yu expects a \"weak expansion\" in factory activity in December as policymakers work toward the annual growth target of \"around 5%.\" Separately, the official non-manufacturing PMI, comprising construction and services, fell to 49.5, marking the first contraction for the index since December 2022, the official data showed, dragged by weakness in the real estate and residential services sectors. Economic downswing The readings offered an early glimpse of how the economy fared in November after a slew of data showed the economic slowdown had worsened in the final quarter of this year, amid a prolonged housing downturn and sluggish domestic demand. Fixed-asset investment, which covers real estate, declined 1.7% in the first ten months of the year, levels unseen since 2020 when the pandemic hit. For October alone, fixed-asset investment fell 11.4% from a year earlier, the worst reading since early 2020. Property investment extended declines, shrinking 14.7% in the first ten months, widening from 13.9% in the first three quarters.  watch nowIndustrial output expanded 4.9% in October from a year earlier, while growth in retail sales slowed for a fifth straight month to 2.9%. Both marked their weakest levels since August 2024, according to LSEG data. Signaling further economic malaise, China's exports in October unexpectedly contracted for the first time in nearly two years, dropping 1.1% year on year, as businesses' front-loading momentum tapered off.  The latest economic data suggested China's growth is likely to decelerate further to below 4.5% in the fourth quarter, said Tommy Xie, managing director and head of Asia macro research at OCBC Bank, from the 4.8% expansion in the third quarter.    The economist pointed to the upcoming Politburo meeting and the Central Economic Work Conference later this month for policymakers' signals on next year's economic priorities. Tensions with the U.S. have, however, eased after a temporary trade truce following President Donald Trump's meeting with Chinese leader Xi Jinping in South Korea in late October. Washington agreed to roll back steep tariffs on Chinese exports in exchange for Beijing cracking down on illicit fentanyl trade, pausing export controls of rare earths and resuming purchases of American soybeans. The U.S. also agreed to suspend for one year the port fees levied on Chinese vessels, as well as its plans to bar certain Chinese firms from its technology. While the trade truce may help reduce the uncertainty, \"a meaningful demand recovery is unlikely to come easily,\" economists at Bank of America said in a note on Monday, as domestic consumption and investment remain under pressure and the policy boost on government funding for infrastructure investment has yet to kick in.  The Wall Street bank expects deflation risks to persist in the economy next year as \"the aggregate demand [is] likely to stay sluggish for longer.\" Mainland China's CSI 300 was up 0.36% on Monday while Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index edged up 0.74%. The offshore yuan last traded at 7.0711 against the greenback. ",

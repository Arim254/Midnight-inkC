How old should they be when they get their first phone or tablet? What parental controls, if any, should you use?</p><p>No matter what you decide, you need to follow one \"imperative\" rule to help your kids grow up to be happy, successful adults, says psychologist Jean Twenge: \"No electronic devices in the bedroom overnight.\"</p><p>\"That's just a situation where there's, kind of, no argument: 'You do not need that phone in your bedroom when you are supposed to be sleeping. Period. End of story. Mic drop. We're done,'\" says Twenge, a professor of psychology at San Diego State University whose latest book, \"<a href=\"https://www.jeantwenge.com/10-rules-for-raising-kids-in-a-high-tech-world/\" target=\"_blank\">10 Rules for Raising Kids in a High-Tech World</a>,\" published on September 2.</p><p>Twenge has spent much of the past decade <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2017/08/05/smartphones-ruining-mental-health-teens.html\">warning parents</a> about the risks of giving young adolescents unlimited access to smartphones and social media. She's cited <a href=\"https://www.who.int/europe/news/item/25-09-2024-teens--screens-and-mental-health\" target=\"_blank\">research</a> connecting their usage to higher rates of mental health issues in teens, including anxiety and depression.</p><p>Some other parenting and medical experts <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/23/jonathan-haidts-advice-for-planning-a-screen-free-afternoon-for-kids.html\">have issued similar warnings</a>: In 2023, then-U.S. Surgeon General Vivek Murthy <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2023/05/23/us-surgeon-general-we-must-protect-kids-from-social-media-risks-now.html\">issued an advisory</a> warning that the risks of social media and connected devices have helped create \"a national youth mental health crisis,\" for example.</p><p>In her book, Twenge advocates for parents to wait as long as possible before handing over smartphones to their kids, or allowing them on social media platforms. She recommends keeping kids from joining social media until they're 16 or older, and from having full access to their own smartphone until they have a driver's license and are expected to \"get around independently.\"</p><p>But banning devices from kids' rooms overnight is her No. 1 rule because of its potential to improve their sleep habits, she says. Doing so is \"absolutely crucial for both physical and mental health,\" she notes in her book.</p><p>\"If you have the bandwidth to fully follow only one rule in this book, make it this one,\" writes Twenge. \"No devices in the bedroom overnight is very straightforward and costs nothing.\"</p></div><h2><a></a>'Not getting enough sleep is a risk factor'</h2><div><p>Devices in bedrooms can easily cut into sleeping time, whether your teen puts off shutting their eyes to continue scrolling through social media or the sounds of notifications keep waking them up, <a href=\"https://www.commonsensemedia.org/press-releases/teens-are-bombarded-with-hundreds-of-notifications-a-day\" target=\"_blank\">research shows</a>.</p><p>More than two-thirds of adolescents surveyed <a href=\"https://www.commonsensemedia.org/sites/default/files/research/report/2023-cs-smartphone-research-report_final-for-web.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">by Common Sense Media in</a> 2023 reported missing out on sleep \"sometimes\" or \"often\" due to using phones or other devices late at night in their bedrooms. Overall, 77% of teens get an insufficient amount of sleep, <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/sleep/data-research/facts-stats/high-school-students-sleep-facts-and-stats.html\" target=\"_blank\">according to data</a> from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p><p>\"Not getting enough sleep is a risk factor for just about everything we'd like our kids to avoid, from getting sick to feeling depressed,\" Twenge writes in her book.</p><p>Looking at screens in bed <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2017/11/03/nobel-prize-winner-sleep-research-dont-take-your-phone-to-bed.html\">is connected to higher rates</a> of mental and physical health issues for adults, too. But healthy sleeping habits are even more important for kids, because their brains are still developing. Sleep can help enable their <a href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9685105/\" target=\"_blank\">cognitive development and mental health</a>, including their ability to learn and regulate their emotions — <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2024/12/13/the-no-1-strategy-for-raising-mentally-strong-kids-psychotherapist.html\">traits they'll need</a> to develop to grow up and become happy, healthy and successful adults.</p><p>\"If you can only do one thing, [this rule] might end up making the biggest difference,\" says Twenge.</p></div><h2><a></a>Be honest, but firm</h2><div><p>Any of Twenge's rules will likely be met with resistance from kids, especially teenagers who already regularly use their smartphones and other devices at all times of day, she says. You can more easily implement and enforce these types of policies by communicating them to your kids at an early age, she advises.</p><p>Twenge recommends having conversations about the dangers of smartphones — and the need for strict rules around their use — as soon as elementary school. \"Kids are getting these devices younger and younger\" and your child might have friends who are already using connected devices at that age, she says.</p><p>Parents of older kids can also backtrack and put new, stricter rules in place. That's what Twenge did with her own three teenage daughters, after initially allowing them to use their laptops overnight, she says. Retroactively establishing strict rules isn't easy, she adds: \"The first few days might be tough, and you might get some slammed doors.\"</p><p>Her advice is to be transparent, but firm, about your decision process. \"You should be honest with your kid [and say], 'Look, I made a mistake. I now know more, I've learned more, and we're going to do it differently going forward,'\" says Twenge.</p><p><em><strong>Want to be your own boss?</strong> Sign up for CNBC's new online course, </em><a href=\"https://smarter.cnbcmakeit.com/p/how-to-start-a-business-for-first-time-founders?utm_source=cnbc&utm_medium=makeitarticle&utm_campaign=bottom\" target=\"_blank\"><em>How To Start A Business: For First-Time Founders</em></a><em>.

He started planning his return to the country.</p><p>The veteran returned to his life in the United States and the Air Force, where he completed his service on a military base in Wyoming before being honorably discharged in 2019.</p></div><div><p>Ryan's favorite part of the apartment is his view.</p><p>Louis Corallo for CNBC Make It</p></div><div><p>Soon after leaving the Air Force, Ryan relocated to Vietnam, where he lives off roughly $4,000 a month, according to documents reviewed by CNBC Make It. His monthly income stems from several sources, including VA disability, the GI Bill since he's pursuing a master's degree, and teaching English. Ryan also occasionally takes on odd jobs, such as voiceover work, and is an avid fan of day trading.</p><p>Ryan suffers from spine arthritis, respiratory issues, auditory pain, and mental health challenges from his time in the military.</p><p>\"This might not sound like a lot in America but trust me, this is more than enough to be middle or even above middle class in Vietnam,\" he says.</p><p>When Ryan first arrived, he worked with a longtime friend and realtor to find his first apartment. He moved around a lot at first because of all the noise pollution. He also wanted to take advantage of low rent prices during the covid-19 pandemic.</p><p>\"There's a lot of honking, street sellers and sometimes karaoke really loudly, so if you are very intolerant to noise, this might not be the place for you,\" he says.</p></div><div><p>Ryan says he has no plans of leaving this apartment.</p><p>Louis Corallo for CNBC Make It</p></div><div><p>In 2023, Ryan moved into the two-bedroom, one-bathroom apartment where he currently resides in Ho Chi Minh City.

In America, I felt very unmotivated. I felt like no matter how hard you work, you're still in poverty. You're constantly chasing a standard that you can't really achieve,\" he says.</p><p>\"Here in Vietnam, it takes a lot of the monetary pressure out of your day-to-day. You focus on what makes you happy, who you want to become and how you're going to get there.\"</p></div><div><p>Ryan lives in one of the country’s tallest residential towers in Ho Chi Minh City.</p><p>Louis Corallo for CNBC Make It</p></div><div><p>This experience, he says, is the complete opposite of what his life was like back in the U.S.</p><p>\"Every day I wake up with a long to-do list of things I want to do, not the things that I need to do, and it's a completely different way of living.

At one point, open positions outnumbered available workers by more than 2 to 1.</p><p>\"A lot of the new entrants in the market, young workers, recent graduates, people who are already unemployed [are] having a hard time getting into the market,\" said Cory Stahle, senior economist at job postings site Indeed, which itself provides an encompassing menu of labor market data. \"Regardless of what the unemployment rate is, people taking longer to find jobs is a sign of some economic distress for some households.\"</p></div><h2><a></a>Signs of imbalances</h2><div><p>Indeed's <a href=\"https://data.indeed.com/#/\" target=\"_blank\">measure of job postings</a> shows a decline of about 8.9% from a year ago as of Sept. 26, a sharper drop than the 5.5% reflected in BLS data, which only runs through August.</p><p>Broader trends suggest an uneven labor market, with professions like health care continuing to thrive while other fields lag, Stahle said.</p><p>\"Overall, things are looking pretty good, but a lot of those job gains, a lot of those postings and hiring, are coming from health care, and so it's hard to say that the labor market is fully in balance when it's not providing equal opportunities across different occupations,\" he said.</p><p>BLS data also has shown a fairly sizeable tilt in openings toward health care-related professions, with business and professional services next followed by leisure and hospitality. Government had been a leader but has pulled back since President Donald Trump began his term in January with a vow to pare down the federal payroll.</p><p>\"Right now is a good time to be a nurse, not so good of a time to be working as a software developer,\" Stahle added. \"That bifurcation of the labor market is also an important thing to look at here, not just the overall balance and an overall number.\"</p><p>Other indicators paint a similar picture, though <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/01/private-payrolls-declined-in-september-by-32000-in-key-adp-report-coming-amid-shutdown-data-blackout.html\">ADP's private payroll count</a> for September showed a decline of 32,000 jobs and an August loss of 3,000 as well.

There are, unfortunately, very few that get filled,\" Bill Dunkelberg, chief economist at the National Federation of Independent Business, told CNBC on Friday. \"So plans to fill them are always very optimistic, but when the dust clears, very few jobs actually get created.\"</p></div></div>"

But the independent, outside accounting firms, in particular the \"Big Four\" — Deloitte, EY, KPMG and PwC — that help prepare them stand to lose a major portion of their audit business. On average, it takes about 180 hours to prepare a requisite form 10-Q, at an expense that can vary from $50,000 for smaller companies to well over $1 million for large-cap enterprises. And that doesn't include expenditures for internal audit teams and operations.</p><p>It's important to note the distinction between a quarterly report, or 10-Q, and an earnings report. The SEC-required 10-Q is prepared and reviewed by independent auditors, following strict disclosure standards. Around the same time, via a press release, companies issue a quarterly earnings report — which is not audited — to the media and investors, highlighting revenue, profits and other key metrics featured in the official 10-Q.</p><p>\"I'm sure [the Big Four] are paying very close attention to this proposal as it potentially moves through the SEC,\" said Jerry Maginnis, a CPA and former audit partner at KPMG. \"It could have a very significant impact on their business model.\"</p><p>He estimates that up to 15% of the firms' annual audit fees \"could be going away.\"</p><p>The Big Four might be able to recoup some of that lost revenue by expanding their advisory and tax services, but if not, they would have to consider cost cuts, said Larry Rand, a visiting professor of economics at Brown University and a financial consultant. \"If you are going to be losing a substantial revenue flow, you're certainly going to have to look at ways of saving money,\" he said. \"They will hire fewer people. They will use more artificial intelligence tools,\" he added.</p><p>That's happening as it is. <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/pwc-hiring-fewer-junior-associates-ai-offshoring-big-four-2025-8\" target=\"_blank\">PwC said</a> in August that it expects to hire one-third fewer people off college campuses by 2028 — 39% fewer in audit — partly driven by the rapid emergence of AI and how it's changing entry-level jobs. The SEC rule change could be another blow to accounting firms' workforces.</p><p>The proposed SEC rule change came as somewhat of a surprise. It hadn't been among Trump's plethora of deregulation targets, from immigration to DEI, nor was it included in the now-prescient Project 2025 playbook.</p><p>But during Trump's first term, he threw out the same pitch in 2018. \"That would allow greater flexibility & save money,\" he posted on Twitter (now X). \"I have asked the SEC to study!\" The SEC elicited <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-26-18/s72618.htm?campaign_id=4&emc=edit_dk_20250916&instance_id=162639&nl=dealbook&regi_id=46899355&segment_id=206001&user_id=3f253630d9e330aaf579d9ddaec0d2f5\" target=\"_blank\">comments</a> from a variety of affected stakeholders — the accounting industry, investment research firms, institutional and individual investors and academics — but ultimately, momentum stalled.</p><p>This iteration is likely to go through the same process, but has a good chance of succeeding, especially considering the current administration's <a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/articles/tracking-regulatory-changes-in-the-second-trump-administration/\" target=\"_blank\">deregulatory wins to date</a> and agencies' steady compliance with Trump's wishes. Indeed, a spokesperson for the SEC said that the agency \"is prioritizing this proposal to further eliminate unnecessary regulatory burdens on companies.\"</p><p>Each of the Big Four accounting firms declined to comment.</p><p>Although today's economy is remarkably different from that in 2018 — look no further than tariffs, trade wars and AI — it's instructive to review comments accounting firms did make back in 2018 when the SEC first undertook the quarterly reporting issue.</p><p>Not surprisingly, considering the negative implications for the industry, all four were in favor of retaining the quarterly cadence, each citing values that it brings to investors and capital markets. Deloitte, for example, said, \"By helping to ensure that investors receive regular, timely and reliable information, the SEC regime has helped make the U.S. markets the strongest and most trusted in the world.\"</p><p>\"We believe quarterly reporting minimizes information asymmetry between management and investors and reduces market uncertainty,\" EY said. \"Quarterly reporting also helps reduce risks in the corporate financial reporting system by facilitating timely identification and resolution of potential accounting and reporting issues.\"</p><p>Financial statement users, said KPMG, \"have historically relied on the negative assurance provided by the auditors' review for their investment decisions.\"</p><p>PwC, remarking on the difficulty of reforming reporting, said that the \"unstructured nature of earnings releases could make it challenging for investors to determine what information was subject to the independent auditor's interim review procedures. Additional guidance would need to be developed.\"</p><p>At the same time they argued against the rule change, the firms were careful to acknowledge the SEC's authority to review its quarterly reporting schedule, which has been mandated since 1970. For instance, KPMG said, \"We applaud the Commission's continued efforts to take a fresh look at the financial reporting requirements…to update and streamline them for the benefit of all market participants.\"</p><p>The reporting process, EY said, \"could benefit from targeted improvements that would reduce the compliance burden on companies.\"</p></div><div><p><img src=\"https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/108199362-17580343831758034380-41674851475-1080pnbcnews.jpg?v=1758034382&w=750&h=422&vtcrop=y\" alt=\"Long-Term Stock Exchange CEO on biannual reporting: Pleased the President agrees with us\" /><span></span><span><div><p><span>watch now</span><span></span></p></div></span></p></div><div><p>Its merits have long been debated by business leaders and investors, but the concept of semi-annual reporting has precedent. The European Union and the U.K. switched from a quarterly cadence more than a decade ago, although companies can voluntarily choose to issue quarterly reports.</p><p>Those foreign companies \"are not required to report quarterly, but a fair amount of larger companies still do,\" even if it's not an official earnings release, said Dominic Pappalardo, chief multi-asset manager for financial research firm Morningstar.</p><p>Pappalardo can foresee that same scenario being adopted in the U.S., he said. \"If the companies think there's a benefit to giving investors quarterly information, they're going to continue to do it. I believe that some, if not many, [would] continue to provide some sort of quarterly update,\" he said.</p><p>Some commentators back in 2018 noted that any public firms needing to issue debt or equity at any given time might have no choice but to report quarterly numbers, or face a higher cost of capital. There will also be some level of peer checks taking place in the market — if a public company is out of step with key competitors on reporting schedules, investor money could move away from it.</p><p>For these and many other reasons, accounting firms' fears of losing business may be less extreme than they seem on the surface. \"Even if it's not required by the SEC,\" Maginnis said, \"it would not be surprising to me that [certain clients] would want their accounting firm to be involved somewhat similarly to what's happening currently. In those cases, the revenue streams might not be impacted as much,\" he added.</p><p>Besides lessening the expense and rigors of quarterly reporting, another argument in favor of a semi-annual mandate is that it would encourage private companies to go public. The number of publicly listed companies in the U.S. has fallen from more than 7,000 in 1996 to less than 4,000 in 2020.</p><p>Reinvigorating the IPO market — which has lately been <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/15/tech-ipos-bullish-figma-circle-roaring-after-years-of-prohibition-.html\">gaining momentum</a> — would be an additional way for the Big Four to keep their heads above water. \"From their point of view, it's zero sum,\" Rand said. \"They may lose revenues from their existing client base, but will pick up revenues from more companies going public if they know that they only have to report semi-annually.\"</p><p>It will take months for the SEC to again gather and sift through comments to this proposal. Although the Big Four pushed back, if gently, against Trump's 2018 proposal, the firms may be more conciliatory this time around — if for no other reason than fretting the type of jawboning that has been a hallmark of Trump 2.0. \"That is a pervasive reaction to a lot of potential commenters,\" Rand said. \"I don't think it would be a safe thing to do.\"</p><p>Regardless, Maginnis believes the stars are aligning in favor of the scheduling change. \"Between the president's support and encouragement of this, and the current SEC leadership's approach to the regulatory landscape, I would say it's got at least a 50-50 chance of going through, and maybe a little better than that.\"</p></div></div>"

    "body": "<div><div><p>For Dawon Matthews, pursuing entrepreneurship has always been a \"no brainer.\"</p><p>After he was charged with a felony at age 19, Matthews couldn't find a job in the corporate world, so he decided to carve his own path, he says.</p><p>\"Once they see a felony behind a person they don't even care about what credentials you got. You're just not accepted in that society,\" Matthews says.</p><p>Now, Matthews, 32, currently owns five companies, most notably his successful Houston, Texas food truck, Goodies Soul Kitchen.</p><p>Born in Philadelphia, Matthews had a \"rough start\" in life, before his family moved to the metro area borough of Norristown, he says.</p><p>\"Growing up, I didn't have any mentors or anyone I wanted to be like. I just had a bunch of people that I didn't want to be like,\" he says.</p><p>Matthews excelled in high school, but got into legal trouble in college.</p><p>As a freshman, he was charged with aggravated assault after a party brawl, for which he was expelled from school and served 6 months in jail. While on probation, he was charged with a DUI.</p><p>\"That just led to me going down a hole of just going in and out of the system,\" Matthews recalls.</p><p>Though Matthews earned an associate's degree from Manor College and a B.A. in business from La Salle University, he applied to over 200 jobs in a two-month period with no luck. He started his first company \"due to the simple fact that I couldn't get a job with my college degree,\" he says.</p><p>Today, his businesses collectively bring in over $1 million in net revenue annually.</p><h3><strong>'Always looking for the next thing'</strong></h3><p>In 2017, Matthews launched his first business, a cleaning company called Wonderful Cleaning, in the Philadelphia area with his childhood friend Darnell Hinton.</p><p>He chose to enter the cleaning industry because it had low startup costs and didn't require background checks for business owners, he says.</p><p>\"As long as you can get some bleach and some hot water and some spray bottles and some rags, you can turn this thing into a business,\" Matthews says.</p><p>His first job was cleaning his brother's house, but with help from his high school football coach, Matthews landed more lucrative commercial cleaning contracts.</p><p>By the end of year two, Wonderful Cleaning brought in around $12,000 in revenue each month, and Matthews transitioned into being the \"middleman,\" hiring other cleaning crews to fulfill his contracts.</p><p>With the revenue from Wonderful Cleaning, Matthews and Hinton bought a pickup truck and started a second business, R&R Junk Removal, in 2020.</p><p>A few months in, they were able to purchase a dump truck, and R&R Junk Removal brought in over $100,000 in its first year, according to Matthews.</p><p>Matthews also used his income from the two businesses to buy single-family properties, which he refinanced in order to buy duplexes and triplexes. He currently owns 16 properties in the Philadelphia area, from which he makes around $11,000 a month in profit.</p><p>In January 2024, Matthews moved to Houston: \"I felt like I reached my success in Philly, so I wanted to get out of there,\" he says.</p><p>Not all of his business ideas were hits: right after moving to Houston, Matthews sold a couple of his properties to start a nightclub. It didn't work out, he says, and he ended up losing over $170,000 on the venture.</p><p>After that, he decided to try the restaurant industry.</p><p>\"I'm always looking for the next thing,\" he says, \"and then that's when I came up with food.\"</p><p>Matthews took out a $40,000 loan to buy a food truck and launched Goodies Soul Kitchen in August 2024, which he operates with business partner Jessica Ahwash.</p></div><div><p>Goodies Soul Kitchen is a food truck based in Houston, Texas.</p><p>Corentin Soibinet/CNBC Make It</p></div><div><h3><strong>Finding success in the food industry</strong></h3><p>Other than working at KFC during his freshman year of college, Matthews didn't have any prior restaurant experience when he started Goodies.</p><p>There were plenty of growing pains: \"I didn't even know how to turn the trailer on when I first started,\" Matthews says.</p><p>And just one month after launching Goodies Soul Food Kitchen, the chef he hired quit unexpectedly.</p><p>\"I don't know nothing about food,\" Matthews says, but \"I had to figure out how to become a chef\" until he could hire another.</p><p>For Matthews, developing Goodies' business model was paramount.</p><p>He was inspired by the success of chains like Chick-Fil-A and Chipotle: \"These people aren't doing anything different. Their food isn't different than any other food you'll see at KFC, Popeyes or anything like that. But what is different is the service,\" he says.</p><p>\"Looking at it as a businessman, the money isn't in food,\" he continues. \"The money is in the service and the quality and the systems that you produce. That's where you reach your success in the food industry.\"</p><p>In his view, Houston's late night food scene was \"not that good,\" so Matthews decided to market Goodies Soul Kitchen as an evening option for clubgoers.</p><p>Goodies Soul Kitchen's offers fried fish, lamb chops, chicken wings and fried chicken, as well as side dishes like mac-and-cheese, sweet potato casserole and fried cabbage.</p><p>The truck currently operates four days a week from 7 p.m. to 3 a.m., and Matthews has four employees who run the truck and handle food prep.</p><p>Unlike many other food trucks, Goodies Soul Kitchen is always based at the same location in downtown Houston. On average, they serve about 300 customers each week – more on a \"good club night,\" but less when it's raining, he says.</p><p>This summer, Goodies Soul Kitchen brought in around $20,000 in revenue each week, Matthews says, and the truck has been profitable since the beginning.</p><p>In 2024, Goodies brought in just over $1 million in gross revenue, according to documents reviewed by CNBC Make It, and according to Matthews, they're on track to make even more in 2025 with catering contracts and holiday parties.</p><p>As of September this year, Goodies has made over $665,000 in sales.</p><h3><strong>Food is the future</strong></h3><p>Following the success of Goodies, Matthews opened another food truck, Birds and Buns, which sells hoagies, tacos and chicken wings, in March 2025.</p><p>\"I thought, you know, what the heck? We did really well at this business model. Let's do another one,\" he says.</p><p>He plans to sell most of his other companies in the next year in order to focus on his food businesses.</p><p>\"They say you start to find what you want to do for the rest of your life around this age,\" Matthews says. \"I think I found my love for entrepreneurship in hospitality.\"</p><p>Aside from his business goals, Matthews is also committed to employing recovering addicts and former felons.</p><p>\"Here, you're not judged by a paper,\" he says. \"You're not judged by a record. You're judged by your skills.\"</p><p>Managing all of his ventures isn't easy, Matthews says, but his mantra is \"choose your hard.\"</p><p>\"Being poor is hard. Being rich is hard. Being happy is hard. Being sad is hard, right? So it's the reality of just choosing your 'hard.'\"</p><p>Matthews is currently preparing to expand Goodies into a brick-and-mortar location with a sports bar and burger shop.</p><p>Going forward, it's \"Goodies to the moon,\" he says.</p><p><em><strong>Want to be your own boss?</strong> Sign up for Smarter by CNBC Make It's new online course, </em><a href=\"https://smarter.cnbcmakeit.com/p/how-to-start-a-business-for-first-time-founders?utm_source=cnbc&utm_medium=makeitarticle&utm_campaign=bottom\" target=\"_blank\"><em>How To Start A Business: For First-Time Founders</em></a><em>.

It's a time capsule, and one day, they'll be glad it exists.</p><p>It was practical to secure email addresses using their names before they were taken. But I also knew the deeper value. Having worked with families facing illness, grief, and loss, I've seen how children treasure keepsakes and words that preserve connection.</p><p>When parents are reminded of life's fragility, they often seek ways to capture memories, share guidance, and support their children — even if they can't be there for every moment. In my work, I see this daily, which shapes how I parent: I don't wait for <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2024/11/06/phrases-emotionally-intelligent-parents-use-to-talk-to-kids-about-hard-things.html\">hard moments</a>; I prepare for them.</p><p>These inboxes have become a way to build a legacy, a living collection of love, advice, and stories my kids can carry with them.

You can make this practice your own. I tend to write:</p><h3>On birthdays</h3><p>Every year, I send an email on or around their birthday. Sometimes it's long, sometimes short and sweet. </p><p>This year I'm writing something like: \"Today you're 3. You chose a Minnie Mouse birthday with your favorite color, green. You are fierce, full of words, and love to dance. I can't wait to see who you become, and I love every moment you greet me with a big smile in the morning.\"</p><h3><strong>At silly and special moments</strong></h3><p>I like to jot down quick notes when I want to capture something small but meaningful — the way my kids say a certain phrase, a silly moment we shared, or something that surprised me. Often it starts with, \"Things I want to remember…\" or \"I love the way you…\"</p><p>One email I wrote says: \"I never want to forget the way you call your Chicago Bears blanket your 'gummy bear blanket.'\"</p><p>When my daughter eventually starts saying it correctly, I know I'll suddenly miss it — and notice how quickly she's growing and changing. These little snapshots help me preserve the ordinary magic of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/14/ive-worked-with-over-1000-kids-the-no-1-phrase-to-validate-your-child-at-every-age.html\">childhood</a>, and sometimes I'll even attach a photo alongside the words.</p><h3><strong>During difficult moments</strong></h3><p>Parenting isn't just about the highlight reel. I write when things are difficult, too. It helps me process my feelings and shows my children that <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/06/01/ive-worked-with-over-1000-kids-if-you-want-yours-to-trust-you-do-this.html\">love remains steady</a> even in struggle. </p><p>Recently I wrote: \"Your fierce personality has been testing my limits lately, but I keep reminding myself you'll use it for good one day. You push limits. You stand tall. You fight for what you want — all things I'll one day admire. At night, I sneak into your room and whisper how much I love you. Even when it's hard, it's still so fun. I hope you feel it, too.\"</p></div><h2><a></a>When they'll get their emails</h2><div><p>When I picture how my children might one day receive these notes, a few possibilities come to mind. I might share it on a milestone birthday, like turning 18, or during life transitions such as graduating high school or college.</p><p>Of course, I hope to live a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2024/08/07/7-lessons-for-a-long-happy-life-from-people-who-triumphed-after-60.html\">long, healthy life</a> and see my children grow into adults who eventually take care of me. I don't write these emails out of fear, but out of love and an awareness of how important it is to capture memories, connection, and joy.</p><p>But if life throws a curveball and tragedy strikes, I know that at any time I'll be able to give them an inbox filled with reminders that they were always seen, always known, and always cherished. </p><p>No matter the timing, they'll know my love is steady and my words are always with them.</p></div><h2><a></a>Want to try it yourself? </h2><div><p>Create a simple email address for your child. Whether they are in infancy or in school, it's never too late to start. </p><p>Then send one personal, simple note. Describe who they are today,  saying a little bit about their personality and interests. Jot down what you love about them and what your hopes are for them. </p><p>From there, set reminders on your phone or calendar around birthdays, holidays, and other milestones or transitions. </p><p>Try not to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2024/11/07/use-this-perfect-2-word-phrase-to-stop-overthinking.html\">overthink</a> it.

Risher served as Amazon's senior vice president of U.S. retail between 1997 and 2002.</p><p>In fact, Bill Gates tried to talk Risher out of the move, he said on the podcast, reminding him he'd been \"successful\" at the larger company, where Risher had developed Microsoft's first database product, called Access.</p><p>Gates — then the world's wealthiest person, with a net worth estimated by Forbes at <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1996-07-01-fi-20274-story.html\" target=\"_blank\">$18 billion</a> in September 1996 — was surprised Risher would want to leave Microsoft for an internet startup that reported annual revenue of just <a href=\"https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/company-news/amazons-original-1997-letter-to-shareholders\" target=\"_blank\">$15.7 million</a> in 1996, only two years after Jeff Bezos founded the company.</p><p>\"'Things are going well [here]. You mean to tell me you're leaving this company for some tiny, little internet bookstore that nobody's ever heard of … that has got to be the stupidest decision I've ever heard anyone make,'\" Risher said Gates told him at the time. A spokesperson for Gates did not immediately respond to CNBC Make It's request for comment.</p><p>While Risher understood the inherent risk of leaving an established tech giant for a much smaller, and unproven, startup, Amazon's founder had made a convincing case, Risher said.</p></div><h2><a></a>'We'll be a billion-dollar business' by 2000</h2><div><p>Risher actually first met Bezos over the phone a year before joining Amazon, when the founder called him to check a work reference for another new employee Bezos was hiring. </p><p>\"We had a great conversation and I was really impressed by the questions he asked, and that the CEO of Amazon would take 45 minutes to personally do a background check,\" Risher told journalist Danielle Newnham in a <a href=\"https://medium.com/swlh/david-risher-the-quiet-revolutionary-1e6d1512eadb\" target=\"_blank\">2015 interview</a>.</p><p>By 1996, Risher had become so impressed with Bezos and Amazon that he began interviewing for a job at the young startup. There were two things about Bezos that convinced Risher he was making the right decision, he said. The first was Bezos' obsession with the customer experience.</p><p>\"The idea that you, personally, can improve the lives of millions of customers if you take the responsibility seriously is very powerful,\" he told Newnham.</p><p>The other part of Bezos' pitch that won over Risher was the entrepreneur's confidence that Amazon could be the next huge tech company. </p><p>At the time, Amazon had a \"relatively small business\" that <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2024/01/13/in-1997-jeff-bezos-said-why-he-chose-books-to-sell-on-amazon.html\">initially only focused on selling books</a>. But, Bezos had a clear vision that would start with books and eventually expand to more and more product categories until Amazon became the \"<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/08/jeff-bezos-amazon-turned-into-the-everything-store-because-of-an-email-i-sent-in-1997.html\">everything store</a>\" it is today.</p><p>\"'I think if we do everything right, by the time we're in the year 2000, we'll be a billion-dollar business,'\" Bezos said, according to Risher.</p></div><h2><a></a>A 'very compelling' opportunity</h2><div><p>Risher obviously bought into Bezos' vision for Amazon. He found the opportunity to be at the forefront of that sort of massive, rapid growth to be \"very compelling,\" he said.</p><p>\"I thought to myself: 'How often do you get to be at a company that's right at this crazy intersection of technology and culture and all these different things, and build something that could be a billion-dollar company?'\" he told Fortune.</p><p>Amazon ended up beating Bezos' prediction by one year, hitting $1.6 billion in annual revenue in 1999. Risher was a huge part of that growth, joining Amazon as the company's 37th employee overall, he said. Risher's role involved expanding Amazon into a variety of new product categories, including music, movies and toys.</p><p>When Risher left the company to become a business professor at the University of Washington in 2002, Amazon's annual revenue was $3.9 billion.</p><p>Now 60 years old, Risher has led Lyft since 2023 and he still takes leadership inspiration from his former bosses, the billionaires Gates and Bezos, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/09/lyft-ceo-i-learned-these-lessons-from-bill-gates-jeff-bezos.html\">Risher often says</a>. He also fondly remembers the excitement of Amazon's early years.</p><p>\"It was really quite a rocket ship, which is always a fun thing to be on,\" Risher said. \"That building of something that hadn't been built before at that scale was really very exciting.\"</p><p><em><strong>Want to be your own boss?</strong> Sign up for CNBC's new online course, </em><a href=\"https://smarter.cnbcmakeit.com/p/how-to-start-a-business-for-first-time-founders?utm_source=cnbc&utm_medium=makeitarticle&utm_campaign=bottom\" target=\"_blank\"><em>How To Start A Business: For First-Time Founders</em></a><em>.

    "body": "<div><p>President Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill passed over the summer, but the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/20/trump-big-beautiful-bill-2025-tax-changes.html\">tax benefits</a> have barely begun. Many Main Street businesses stand to gain significantly from new tax law deductions into next year, some key ones as high as 100% of costs.</p><p>The favorable tax measures are not all entirely new. Some had been phased out or were going to sunset and now have been resurrected. But there's so much meat to the bill that small businesses may have missed some significant opportunities for bottom-line savings, according to Jeffrey Kelson, co-leader of EisnerAmper's National Tax Office.</p><p>According to Melanie Lauridsen, vice president of tax policy and advocacy with the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, many of the provisions in the bill are particularly favorable to Main Street companies and local economies.</p><p>To be sure, there are still some unknowns, given that the Treasury Department and the IRS still have to release multiple regulations and guidance about how the bill is implemented and interpreted. But overall, it's seen as a boon for small businesses. </p><p>Here are a few of the major benefits coming to Main Street:</p><h3><strong>Business purchase write-offs at 100%</strong></h3><p>Small businesses that have been mulling the purchase of new computers, machinery or other equipment can deduct 100% of the cost in many cases. \"This is a huge jump from the old 40%,\" Ken Webster, chief executive of Rocket Legal Professional Services, wrote in an explainer for small businesses. The perk applies to assets bought on or after January 20, 2025. \"This means you might already qualify for bigger deductions on recent purchases, so be sure and review your year-to-date equipment purchase records,\" Webster wrote.</p><p>Most of these write-offs are for new items, but a different tax code provision lets businesses deduct 100% of certain purchases up to $2.5 million for taxable years beginning after Dec. 31, 2024. To take advantage, the item needs to be new to your business, not necessarily brand new, Webster noted. There are also spending limits before the maximum deduction starts to drop. </p><p>It's advisable to speak to a tax advisor on how best to maximize these write-off options and also reap potential state tax advantages, Kelson said.</p><h3><strong>Big win on R&D deductions</strong></h3><p>The new law encourages domestic research and development. </p><p>As part of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, immediate expensing of R&D costs was ended as of 2022, and businesses had to amortize R&D expenses over time, which could have caused them to pay more taxes in a given year. This was particularly hard on small businesses, and especially start-ups in tech niches like software, said Diana Walker, a director with Baker Tilly's tax practice. </p><p>Now, small businesses can immediately deduct 100% of domestic R&D costs incurred after 2024. \"This is a huge relief for a lot of taxpayers who were negatively impacted by the TCJA,\" Walker said.</p><p>Additionally, there are several ways to get credit for previous domestic R&D expenses, including opting to amend previous returns, so small businesses should speak to their tax advisor about which method to choose, even if they've already filed their 2024 return, she said. </p><p>In 2025, all taxpayers, regardless of their gross receipts, can take advantage of not having to capitalize and amortize domestic R&D. To receive credit for past years, businesses must have gross receipts under $31 million on average from 2022 through 2024 — a bonus for small businesses. \"This bill definitely is favorable to small businesses,\" Walker said.</p><h3><strong>A key interest deduction tied to loans </strong></h3><p>The Big Beautiful Bill revived a more generous calculation for deducting interest, which many small businesses taking on a loan or other forms of debt could benefit from, said Colin Wilhelm, policy analyst in the Washington National Tax Office at Grant Thornton. </p><p>Starting with tax years that begin after Dec. 31, 2024, the legislation brings back the EBITDA-based limitation that had previously been scaled back. This allows for higher interest deductions than under the EBIT-based system.</p><p>\"A lot of small businesses have to take on debt to keep growing. It allows them to deduct that interest and reinvest the savings into the business to keep growing,\" Lauridsen said.</p><h3><strong>'No tax on tips' for owners</strong></h3><p>This provision has received significant press, and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/19/treasury-details-trumps-no-tax-on-tips.html\">the rules are still being written</a>, but it's worth noting given the potential benefit for certain small businesses that can now deduct up to $25,000 in tips annually through 2028. </p><p>Some exceptions to consider: Self-employed individuals can't deduct more than their net income from the business that earned the tips, according to Rocket Legal's Webster. Also, individuals with a modified adjusted gross income over $150,000 for individual taxpayers and $300,000 for joint filers can't take advantage of the deduction. </p><p>Wilhelm recommends that businesses attempting to claim this deduction keep careful records of tips. \"I think there's going to be more scrutiny of those records by the IRS,\" he said.</p><h3><strong>Reducing taxable income</strong> </h3><p>The popular Qualified Business Income (QBI) deduction is now permanent. This allows sole proprietors, partners and S corporation shareholders to deduct 20% of their business income, with certain exceptions. </p><p>The Big Beautiful Bill makes it easier for a larger number of higher-income small business owners to claim this deduction, expanding the income ranges for eligibility starting next year. An eligible business with at least $1,000 in active business income is guaranteed a minimum $400 deduction, which will increase with inflation each year. Certain skilled service businesses, such as health, law and accounting, have income limits for claiming the full deduction.</p><h3><strong>Employer-provided child care credit tax savings</strong></h3><p>All businesses providing employee child care are eligible for a tax credit, and there are expanded benefits for small businesses with less than $31 million in gross receipts for 2025, according to a <a href=\"https://www.uschamber.com/small-business/navigating-the-new-tax-law-what-small-businesses-need-to-know\" target=\"_blank\">resource guide</a> from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. </p><p>Eligible small businesses can claim up to $600,000 and 50% for expenses. With this added benefit, small businesses should evaluate options for providing or expanding employee child-care benefits or programs, according to the Chamber of Commerce. They should consider coordinating with nearby businesses if pooling is an option.</p></div>"

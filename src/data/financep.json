    "body": "Neal Mohan, the CEO of YouTube speaks during a panel for the Summit for Democracy on March 30, 2023 in Washington, DC.Anna Moneymaker | Getty ImagesYouTube's CEO Neal Mohan is the latest in a line of tech bosses who have admitted to limiting their children's social media use, as the harms of being online for young people have become more evident. Mohan, who took the helm of YouTube's leadership in 2023, was just named Time's 2025 CEO of the Year. He said in an interview with the magazine that his children's use of media platforms is controlled and restricted. \"We do limit their time on YouTube and other platforms and other forms of media. On weekdays we tend to be more strict, on weekends we tend to be less so. We're not perfect by any stretch,\" Mohan said in one TikTok video posted by Time Magazine on Thursday. He stressed \"everything in moderation\" is what works best for him and his wife, and that extends to other online services and platforms. Mohan has three children: two sons and one daughter. Experts have continued to sound the alarm on how excessive smartphones and social media use has harmed children and teenagers. Jonathan Haidt, NYU professor and author of \"The Anxious Generation,\" has advocated for children to not have smartphones before the age of 14 and no access to social media before the age of 16.\"Let them have a flip phone, but remember, a smartphone isn't really a phone. They could make phone calls on it, but it's a multi-purpose device by which the world can get to your children,\" Haidt said in an interview with CNBC's Tania Bryer earlier this year.This week, Australia became the first country to formally bar users under the age of 16 from accessing major social media platforms. Ahead of the legislation's passage last year, a YouGov survey found that 77% of Australians backed the under-16 social media ban. Still, the rollout has faced some resistance since becoming law.Mohan said in a more extensive interview with Time on Wednesday that he feels a \"paramount responsibility\" to young people and giving parents greater control over how their kids use the platform. YouTube Kids was launched in 2015 as a child-friendly version of the Google-owned platform. He said his goal is  \"to make it easy for all parents\" to manage their children's YouTube use \"in a way that is suitable to their household,\" especially as every parent has a different approach. Bill Gates, Mark Cuban Several tech bosses have taken a similar approach. YouTube's former CEO Susan Wojcicki, also barred her children from browsing videos on the app, unless they were using YouTube Kids. She also limited the amount of time they spent on the platform. \"I allow my younger kids to use YouTube Kids, but I limit the amount of time that they're on it,\" Wojcicki told CNBC in 2019. \"I think too much of anything is not a good thing.\"Bill Gates, Microsoft's co-founder, is amongst the tech titans who are against allowing young people too much screen time. With three children, now adults, Gates openly talked about not giving them cell phones until they were in their teens. \"We don't have cell phones at the table when we are having a meal, we didn't give our kids cell phones until they were 14 and they complained other kids got them earlier,\" Gates said years ago. Meanwhile, billionaire Mark Cuban would even resort to installing Cisco routers and using management software to monitor which apps his children were on and shut off their phone activity.",

    "body": "From how much energy you have first thing in the morning, to how your mood ebbs and flows throughout the day, the foods you eat have a significant impact on how you feel. It's why doctors and nutritionists alike consider the first meal of the day to be most important. Hunter Stoler, a NYC-based certified nutrition and health coach, has a go-to breakfast that he eats just about every day to feel his best. Known as \"Health with Hunter\" on social media, the 25-year-old also recommends this breakfast to his more than 400,000 followers on Instagram and 300,000+ followers on TikTok. \"I'll say six out of every seven days a week, I have a yogurt bowl just because I know it's balanced,\" Stoler tells CNBC Make It.His yogurt bowl recipe is high in fiber and protein.\"It sets me up for success, it makes me feel good and I'm full for a few hours after that,\" he says.The breakfast allows him to up his fiber intake, which, research shows, many people often lack in their diets. Less than 10% of U.S. adults get the recommended daily intake of fiber, according to a study which was presented at Nutrition 2021 Live Online.Here are the key ingredients in Stoler's daily yogurt bowl. Plus, some of his other healthy breakfast options.Health with Hunter's go-to high-fiber, high-protein breakfastJust about every morning, Stoler mixes together these five ingredients:Non-fat Greek yogurtHalf a serving of protein powderFrozen organic wild blueberriesHealthy cereal or granolaSpices (cinnamon, pumpkin spice or a pinch of salt)\"There's flexibility in that, but the structure of the meal is the same,\" Stoler says. \"That combination of protein from the protein powder and Greek yogurt, fiber from the blueberries, and potentially a little bit from the cereal or granola, is what's going to keep me really full and just satisfied.\"Research shows that the antioxidants found in blueberries can help reduce inflammation, improve your brain health and lead to more positive health outcomes.The opportunities are endless, but remember, it's about the structure with flexibility.Hunter StolerNutrition and health coachOne of Stoler's other go-to morning meals that's high in fiber and protein is overnight oatmeal. He mixes together almond milk or whole milk with a cup of glyphosate-free oats and a scoop of protein powder. He stores it in his fridge until the following day.\"Then the next morning, you have delicious oats that you could top with fruit, a nut butter, which is really great, cinnamon and maybe a little bit of Greek yogurt for more protein,\" Stoler says.If he's craving a warm, healthy breakfast, he toasts high-fiber bread and tops it with savory foods like scrambled eggs and avocado, or yogurt for a sweet option. \"The opportunities are endless, but remember, it's about the structure with flexibility,\" he says.Want to give your kids the ultimate advantage?

    "body": "Today, Dick Van Dyke is officially 100 years old. Born on Dec. 13, 1925, the \"Mary Poppins\" actor took Hollywood by storm with his singing and dancing, and became an Emmy, Grammy and Tony award-winning legend. Now, Van Dyke has earned a new title: centenarian. Over the course of his life, the performer has shared the practices he follows to stay in the best of health.\"When you reach 100, a lot of things don't work too well,\" Van Dyke told The New York Times last month. But \"sometimes I feel like I'm 15 again.\"In his recent book, \"100 Rules for Living to 100: An Optimist's Guide to a Happy Life,\" published last month, Van Dyke explores his secrets for longevity even further. Here are three research-backed staples in his routine that he credits for his 100 years of life. How Dick Van Dyke stays active at 100, and his tips for a long, healthy life1. He moves his body oftenEven at 100, Van Dyke goes to the gym three times a week, he told the New York Times. When he makes his way to each machine, sometimes he dances as he walks, he said.On his off days from the gym, he practices yoga and stretches. Van Dyke said his doctors are amazed at how he's still able to touch his toes.Similar to Van Dyke, many Japanese centenarians — particularly in the blue zone, Okinawa, Japan — start their mornings with exercise. Typically they do a low-intensity workout that airs on the radio, called radio taiso, which is about three minutes long. The exercise also promotes a sense of community because participants tend to practice it alongside friends, colleagues or family.2. He has an optimistic outlook and doesn't turn down opportunities that excite him\"I've decided people are born with a certain personality and a certain outlook, a certain perspective,\" Van Dyke said in a sit-down interview with Al Roker for the TODAY show this November. \"I tend to look on the good side of things.\"Keeping a sense of playfulness in his life helps him experience a lot more fun, he said in his interview with The New York Times. Just last year, Van Dyke starred in Coldplay's music video for the song \"All My Love.\"In the Directors' Cut version of the video, Van Dyke spoke about how his career aligned with his desire to remain a kid at heart. He said he's \"one of those lucky people who got to do for a living what I would have done anyway.\"Often, the happiest centenarians pursue jobs that are fulfilling to them and don't retire. \"Think how lucky I am,\" he said. \"I got to do what I do — play and act silly.\"3. He values quality time with loved onesTowards the end of the \"All My Love\" music video, Van Dyke welcomes his children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren into frame to dance with him. The scene is a symbol of just how much he treasures spending time with his loved ones.Van Dyke is always looking for ways to get his grandchildren and great-grandchildren to enjoy their time at his house, so they want to come back and visit, he told The New York Times. He wants his backyard to resemble a theme park, and mentioned that he's planning to add a zip line next.\"Just hearing them all out there squealing gives me such joy,\" Van Dyke said.A decades-long study conducted by researchers at Harvard found that the key to happiness and longevity is social fitness, or maintaining healthy, long-lasting interpersonal connections.As far as his plans for his birthday today, Van Dyke's itinerary is very relaxed when squared with the major accomplishment of turning 100. Still, it aligns with spending quality time.\"He doesn't want to do anything,\" his wife Arlene Silver told People last week. \"He wants to be in his room watching Jeopardy! reruns with me.\"Want to give your kids the ultimate advantage?

    "description": "After 41 draws without a winner, the Powerball lottery jackpot has climbed to $1 billion — the seventh largest in the lottery's history.Even if you do",
    "body": "After 41 draws without a winner, the Powerball lottery jackpot has climbed to $1 billion — the seventh largest in the lottery's history.Even if you don't match all six numbers, smaller prizes of $1 million and $50,000 are still in play.If you somehow beat the odds and win a large cash prize, what happens next can be just as important as the win itself. That's because decisions you make in the first few days can leave you vulnerable to losing or mismanaging the prize.Here are five common mistakes experts say to avoid, starting the moment the ticket is in your hands.1. Handing an unsigned ticket to the store clerkUntil a lottery ticket is signed, \"the person who physically holds a winning ticket\" can claim the prize, according to the South Carolina Education Lottery, one of the state lotteries that administers Powerball.Participating state lotteries generally direct players to use validation tools — self-check terminals, mobile app scanners or official lottery websites — rather than relying on store staff. That guidance exists in part because store clerks have been caught stealing winning tickets.To prevent fraud, you'll want to sign the ticket in ink right away, state lotteries advise. It also can't hurt to have a photocopy or photo of the signed ticket, since it can help if your ticket is lost or misplaced, according to the South Carolina Education Lottery.2. Not keeping the ticket in a safe placeYou signed the ticket, but where do you put it? Because a winning ticket functions much like cash, you don't want to keep it in your pocket, wallet or lying on a desk in your home, says George Gagliardi, a certified financial planner in Lexington, Massachusetts.\"Holding the winning ticket before claiming it is akin to walking around town with $100 million in your wallet,\" he says.The official ticket needs a secure location. A common recommendation is to lock it in a bank safe deposit box or a personal fireproof safe or lockbox as soon as possible.3. Telling everyone about winningAnnouncing a big lottery win can invite financial requests, scams and unwanted attention, says Gagliardi. It's often safer to keep the news within a very small circle of trusted family members.Some state lotteries require winners to go public when they claim the prize, which is why it can help to consult a financial advisor, a lawyer and an accountant before coming forward, State Farm advises.They can walk you through payout options and, in some states, help set up a trust that allows you to claim the prize anonymously.4. Rushing to claim your prizeWinners are often given between 90 days and a year to claim a prize, depending on the state.Rushing to claim it can prevent you from building the advisory team you'll need to manage immense wealth. Without a lawyer, accountant and financial advisor experienced in large windfalls, you risk making costly decisions about taxes, investments and spending, State Farm reports.5. Deciding on the payout too quicklyPowerball winners must choose between two payout options: a 30-year annuity worth the full listed jackpot amount or a lump-sum cash payout that is roughly half the advertised prize. For a $1 billion jackpot, the annuity would pay about $33.3 million per year, according to USAMega.com.Each option comes with tradeoffs. The annuity provides guaranteed installments with a larger total payout over time, while the cash option gives you immediate access to a sizable sum that can be invested right away. Your age, estate planning needs and comfort with investment risk can all shape which payout structure makes the most sense. Consult a trusted financial professional who can help you make decisions based on your individual financial situation.It can also help to slow down before making a choice, since \"you will be in an emotional state for a while, and one wants to make decisions logically, not emotionally,\" says John Loyd, a certified financial planner in Texas.Want to give your kids the ultimate advantage?

    "description": "Between long office days, late dinners and endless to-dos, many working couples slip into a routine of coexisting instead of really connecting. The ex",
    "body": "Between long office days, late dinners and endless to-dos, many working couples slip into a routine of coexisting instead of really connecting. The excuses feel valid: \"We're exhausted,\" or, \"We'll catch up this weekend.\" The problem is that they both end up missing the everyday moments that keep a relationship alive.As a psychologist who studies couples and as a husband, I've found that people in the happiest, most resilient relationships treat their weeknights as opportunities that don't go wasted.Here are the seven things these couples consistently do before bedtime.1. They start with decompression timeYou can't always expect your partner to walk through the door ready to cook, talk, or be cheerful. Healthy couples build in 15 to 30 minutes of guilt-free alone time for each partner — one decompresses while the other handles a light task, then they switch.It's not glamorous, but it's a huge kindness. By protecting each other's battery early in the evening, they preserve the bandwidth they'll need to connect later on.2. They 'silent sync' when they're drainedSome nights, even after a decompression session, you may still feel drained. Happy couples don't force it. They start their evening together, but quietly: sitting on the balcony, lying side by side, taking a slow walk.In psychological research, this is a form of co-regulation: the process of two people syncing up emotionally, allowing the emotions of the day to rise and fall until they feel like themselves again. A few minutes of shared quiet can reset your rhythm better than a forced conversation.3. They do a quick daily recapNot every weeknight has room for deep emotional check-ins. So the happiest couples keep it simple: each person shares one thing about their day, good or bad. It could be venting some frustration, sharing a little win they had at the office or even just something funny that happened. No advice. No solutions. Just listening. This light, consistent sharing keeps them emotionally updated without draining what's left of their workweek energy.4. They keep one honored ritual, no matter whatEven on nights when both partners want to zone out, they stick to one small shared ritual they never skip. For most, it's something ridiculously simple: eating dinner together without their phones, making a nightly cup of tea, or doing a word game together. The ritual becomes a daily anchor — something predictable, comforting, and theirs alone.5. They cuddle before sleepIf I had to choose just one nightly habit to keep, this would be it. Research shows that partners who cuddle regularly report higher relationship satisfaction and commitment, even compared with couples who emphasize \"quality time\" together.Cuddling triggers oxytocin (the bonding hormone) and lowers cortisol (the stress hormone). It's the easiest, fastest biological boost your relationship can get.6. They 'close the kitchen' as a teamEven the happiest couples feel the low-level resentment of uneven household work. That's why they end the evening with 5 to 10 minutes of shared tidying, wiping counters, packing tomorrow's lunches, loading the dishwasher.The point isn't actually about cleaning, but rather to prove that they're committed to keeping things fair.7. They check in about tomorrowInstead of rehashing the day, heathy and happy couples look ahead. They share one small thing they're looking forward to tomorrow, or even one small thing they're dreading.This is a brief, gentle way for working couples to stay in sync without needing to fully rehash the emotional weight of their day. You get a sense of what your partner might need tomorrow, whether it's encouragement, space, or just a little extra support. And they get the same from you.Mark Travers, PhD, is a psychologist who specializes in relationships. He holds degrees from Cornell University and the University of Colorado Boulder.

Becoming a first-time CEO at age 60 felt somewhat impossible to her, which is exactly why she decided to do it, she said on a Dec. 8 episode of \"The Mel Robbins Podcast.\"Whether you're \"20 or 40 or 60 or 80,\" you can determine whether such a drastic career change is right for you by asking yourself one important question, said Kotb, now 61: Is this job giving me what I deserve?In Kotb's case, she was ready for a new challenge, and realized during an on-air 60th birthday celebration that continuing her journalism career probably wouldn't fulfill that need, she said. \"I was almost having an out of body [experience],\" she said. \"I kept thinking ... This is the top of the wave. I could feel it ... This is the best it's ever going to be.\"Other people may come to a similar conclusion through more a frustrating process: Maybe you've worked a job where you didn't receive enough positive feedback, or the company lacked opportunities for you to learn and grow.DON'T MISS: The ultimate guide to teaching your kids about moneyIf you feel like you're hitting a professional roadblock, you should sit down and figure out what it is that you feel like you deserve, said Kotb. That self-audit shouldn't come from a place of envy or \"FOMO\" around what someone else has, she noted. And it won't always prompt a total career reset — maybe you'll seek a raise or promotion at work instead, for example.\"Look at your life, just look at it from 35,000 feet and then decide, do I want to change it?\" she said. \"And I'm here to tell you, I feel like I'm living, breathing proof that you can change it at any time. Things you thought were impossible are not impossible.\"Kotb has previously said that her decision to leave \"TODAY\" was also influenced by a desire to spend more time with her family. This was made difficult by her daily 3:15 a.m. wakeup to get to work on time, she told People in May.Entrepreneurship now presents Kotb with a different kind of challenge, she's said. \"Being an entrepreneur is hard,\" Kotb told Variety in May. \"I didn't realize how many hats you wear as an entrepreneur ... I'm learning how to be a boss.\"To make building a new career from scratch feel less intimidating, you can start small, Kotb recommended: Spend 30 minutes per day doing something that'll help you make progress, from working on your resume to creating a business plan or learning a new skill. After a month, for example, you'll have 900 minutes of groundwork, rather than making a spur-of-the-moment decision to quit your job without a plan.\"Baby steps toward the jump,\" said Kotb. \"Sometimes we think we want it and you're like, 'I'm going to run and jump off the cliff' ... Don't do that. We're not idiots. We need our paychecks. We need our insurance. We need these things, but we can explore possibilities at the same time.\"Disclosure: NBC and CNBC are divisions of NBCUniversal.Want to give your kids the ultimate advantage?

    "body": "Software company ServiceNow is in advanced talks to buy cybersecurity startup Armis, which was last valued at $6.1 billion, Bloomberg reported. The deal, which could reach $7 billion in value, would be ServiceNow's largest acquisition, the outlet said, citing people familiar with the situation who asked not to be identified because the talks are private. The acquisition could be announced as soon as this week, but could still fall apart, according to the report. Armis and ServiceNow did not immediately return a CNBC request for comment.Armis, which helps companies secure and manage internet-connected devices and protect them against cyber threats, raised $435 million in a funding round just over a month ago and told CNBC about its eventual plans for an IPO.Armis CEO Yevgeny Dibrov and CTO Nadir Izrael.Courtesy: ArmisCEO and co-founder Yevgeny Dibrov said Armis was aiming for a public listing at the end of 2026 or early 2027, pending \"market conditions.\" Armis's decision to be acquired rather than wait for a public listing is a common path for startups at the moment. The IPO markets remain choppy and many startups are choosing to remain private for longer instead of risking a muted debut on the public markets. Founded in 2016, Armis said in August it had surpassed $300 million in annual recurring revenues, a milestone it achieved less than a year after reaching $200 million in ARR.Its latest funding round was led by Goldman Sachs Alternatives' growth equity fund, with participation from CapitalG, a venture arm of Alphabet. Previous backers have included Sequoia Capital and Bain Capital Ventures.Read the complete Bloomberg article here.",

    "body": "Billionaire philanthropist MacKenzie Scott has unveiled the final tally for her 2025 charitable donations, which totaled $7.17 billion in gifts to roughly 225 organizations, she wrote in a blog post published on Tuesday.\"This dollar total will likely be reported in the news, but any dollar amount is a vanishingly tiny fraction of the personal expressions of care being shared into communities this year,\" Scott wrote.Scott's 2025 giving brings her total donation amount since 2019 to $26.3 billion, based on her past public announcements of her charitable giving. This year's donations went to a wide range of nonprofits including several historically Black colleges and universities, and organizations focused on issues including poverty, social injustice and climate change.Scott's updated philanthropic tally puts her behind only fellow billionaires Warren Buffett and Bill Gates in terms of lifetime giving, according to Forbes. Forbes still estimates a $29.9 billion net worth for Scott, who became one of the world's wealthiest women following her 2019 divorce from Amazon founder Jeff Bezos.DON'T MISS: The ultimate guide to teaching your kids about moneyFollowing her divorce, Scott signed The Giving Pledge, committing to giving away the bulk of her wealth in her lifetime. She tasked a team of advisors with helping her step up her philanthropic giving by identifying \"organizations with strong leadership teams and results\" across a wide range of areas of societal need, she wrote in a 2020 blog post.Specifically, she wanted to pay \"special attention to those operating in communities facing high projected food insecurity, high measures of racial inequity, high local poverty rates and low access to philanthropic capital,\" she wrote.In her Tuesday essay, Scott wrote about putting her giving into perspective, citing data from Giving USA, which reported in June that Americans donated more than $590 billion in charitable giving in 2024. Much of the country's philanthropy — whether monetary or otherwise — happens on a relatively small scale, Scott wrote.\"Over 70% of Americans reported giving both labor and money to people they know, and half reported doing the same for strangers,\" wrote Scott, adding: \"It's easy to focus on the methods of civic participation that make news, and hard to imagine the importance of the things we do each day with our own minds and hearts.\"Scott mentioned multiple examples of generosity she received before she became wealthy, helping inspire her more recent philanthropy. She wrote about a \"local dentist who offered me free dental work when he saw me securing a broken tooth with denture glue in college,\" and her college roommate at Princeton University \"who found me crying, and acted on her urge to loan me a thousand dollars to keep me from having to drop out in my sophomore year.\"That roommate, Jeannie Ringo Tarkenton, went on to found Funding U, a student lender that offers loans to low-income students without requiring a co-signer, Scott noted.Scott highlighted those examples while encouraging civic participation in myriad forms, from financial gifts to random acts of kindness: \"Respect, understanding, insight, empathy, forgiveness, inspiration – all of these are meaningful contributions to others.\"Scott's blog post did not break down how or why she chose any of the hundreds of organizations she supported in 2025. A long-standing aspect of her giving does stand out in contrast to many other billionaire philanthropists: Her donations typically come without any strings, meaning organizations are free to use the money however they see fit.Her goal has been to \"de-emphasize privileged voices\" like her own, \"and cede focus to others,\" she wrote in a 2021 blog post.\"People struggling against inequities deserve center stage in stories about change they are creating,\" Scott wrote in that post. \"This is equally — perhaps especially — true when their work is funded by wealth.\"Want to give your kids the ultimate advantage?

    "body": "Kevin Warsh, former governor of the US Federal Reserve, speaks with CNBC on July 17, 2025.CNBCPresident Donald Trump said Friday that Kevin Warsh has moved to the top of his list as the next Federal Reserve chair, though others remain in contention, according to the Wall Street Journal.Previously considered on Trump's short list but not the favorite, Warsh, a former Fed governor himself, apparently ingratiated himself further following an interview Wednesday with the president.\"Yes, I think he is,\" Trump told the paper when asked if Warsh was at the top, according to an account posted Friday afternoon.Referring to National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett, whom prediction markets previously had projected as the favorite, Trump said, \"I think you have Kevin and Kevin. They're both — I think the two Kevins are great.\"\"I think there are a couple of other people that are great,\" the president added.Hassett emerged as the lead candidate following a Bloomberg News report. Publicly, he has been demure when asked about the prospect of taking the job, saying only he would serve if asked. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), said Thursday on CNBC that she worried Trump would appoint a \"sock puppet\" as Fed chair to do his bidding.In addition to putting heavier weight on Warsh getting the job, Trump repeated an assertion he has made in the past that the Fed chair ought to consult the president about interest rate decisions.\"Typically, that's not done anymore. It used to be done routinely. It should be done,\" he said. \"I'm a smart voice and should be listened to.\"Trump has been at odds with the current chair, Jerome Powell, almost from the moment he nominated him for the position in 2017. Often resorting to name-calling and personal insults, Trump has badgered the Fed to lower interest rates, dissatisfied even with the current pace of cuts that has seen the central bank lop off three-quarters of a percentage point from its key rate since September. The Fed most recently cut Wednesday, taking the benchmark federal funds rate down to a range of 3.5%-3.75%, which Trump thinks should be even lower.Trump noted that Warsh largely agrees with his stance on monetary policy.\"He thinks you have to lower interest rates,\" Trump said. \"And so does everybody else that I've talked to.\"Prediction markets moved following the Journal report. Previously giving Hassett about a 71% chance of the nomination, that slipped to 62%, with Warsh at 36%, according to Kalshi.Trump did leave enough space to change his mind, noting that he has several good candidates in front of him.\"I think I have somebody that I like the best,\" he said. \"I like all of them, but I want to be careful because I was given a bad recommendation\" when he named Powell to the spot.Over the year, Trump repeatedly has blamed former Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin for recommending Powell. Current Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has led the current search. Trump has made no secret that he'd prefer Bessent to take on the role, but the Treasury chief has said repeatedly he is not interested.Other candidates considered included current Governors Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman along with Rick Rieder, who runs the fixed income operation at money management giant BlackRock. They were the last of a group of 11 candidates considered for the post.Powell's term expires in May, having been reappointed to the position by former President Joe Biden.Asked at his Wednesday news conference about his legacy, Powell said, \"I really want to turn this job over to whoever replaces me ... with the economy in really good shape. That's what I want to do.\"",

They are known for their excellent diligence and for running many of the most successful campaigns. Starboard has initiated activist campaigns at 59 prior information technology companies and their average return on these situations is 36.92% versus an average of 20.01% for the Russell 2000 during the same time periods. Additionally, Starboard has taken a total of 163 prior activist campaigns in their history and has an average return of 21.26% versus 14.34% for the Russell 2000 over the same period.What's happeningOn Dec. 9, Starboard announced a nearly 5% position in Clearwater Analytics and is urging the company to run a robust sales process if it has received in-bound interest from potential buyers.Behind the scenesClearwater Analytics is a provider of front-to-back, cloud-based investment accounting solutions. The company has steadily taken share from legacy solutions, such as BlackRock, State Street and SS&C, as they are widely viewed as the premium modern platform. In 2016, private equity firm Welsh, Carson, Anderson & Stowe became the majority investor in the company. In 2020, Warburg Pincus and Permira made minority investments, and, about a year later, these three firms took the company public at $18 per share. Clearwater performed fairly well from its IPO through 2024, supported by consistent growth and historically strong margins that drove a premium valuation relative to peers, and these sponsors were rewarded accordingly. Warburg and Permira, which owned 22%, each sold their positions entirely and WCAS, which owned 56%, reduced its stake to roughly 1% by November 2024, at prices as high as $29.11 per share.Shortly thereafter, the company started making a string of acquisitions — a public company, Enfusion, and two private businesses, Beacon and Bistro. All of these transactions were announced between January and March of this year and closed within the following few months. The consequence of this is that Clearwater shifted from being a clean high-growth vertical software story with strong margins, a premium valuation, and a net cash balance, to a riskier, less certain integration story with leverage around 3x EBITDA. Unsurprisingly, the market questioned the company's decision to change course so sharply as well as its ability to integrate these three acquisitions while continuing to maintain its core organic growth story, and the stock sold off sharply, ultimately reaching a low of $15.73 per share after its third-quarter earnings report last month. Shortly thereafter, it was reported that Clearwater had engaged advisers to evaluate strategic options after receiving a bevy of unsolicited offers from firms like Thoma Bravo and even Warburg Pincus and Permira, both of whom still had representatives on the board. These announcements prompted Starboard to disclose its nearly 5% position in Clearwater and urge the company to run a robust sales process if it has received in-bound interest from potential buyers. But don't misunderstand Starboard's motive or thesis. They are not short-term strategic investors jumping on an opportunity for a quick return. They have likely been looking at Clearwater for many months and had owned it because they like the standalone story and see an opportunity to create long term value. But, to paraphrase the overused quote attributed to Mike Tyson (but really said by Cus D'Amato), everyone has a plan until they get hit. And Starboard is as good as anyone with rolling with the punches. So, when news surfaces that the company is considering a sale and that two of its board members may be bidders, Starboard is doing what any good activist would do and making sure there is a fair process to maximize value for shareholders. Starboard will then decide whether that price is better than the risk adjusted value shareholders could receive from a standalone plan of integrating the acquisitions and growing the core business. Moreover, a credible and fair process could likely attract additional bidders, including strategics such as BlackRock and Nasdaq. While the leveraged buyout math works in the high $20s per share, strategics could push it to a 3 handle.  There could be a quick resolution here if the board decides to sell to the company and receives a bid that is good for everyone. But that is a risky activist thesis on its own. What makes this a good activist campaign for Starboard is that they are a believer in the company as a standalone entity and see a path to create shareholder value. If the standalone path is ultimately pursued, it would make a lot of sense for the private equity investors who no longer own any material position to resign from the board and be replaced with industry experts and a shareholder representative who can guide management through a standalone plan. Essentially, there are three potential outcomes to Clearwater's current inflection point: (i) a standalone plan where the company integrates its acquisitions and grows its core; (ii) a sale of the company for a satisfactory premium following a real and competitive review process; or (iii) an abbreviated sale process orchestrated in part by Warburg and Permira resulting in a sale to Warburg and Permira. Starboard would likely be happy with (i) or (ii) and we expect them to do everything within their power to prevent (iii).Ken Squire is the founder and president of 13D Monitor, an institutional research service on shareholder activism, and the founder and portfolio manager of the 13D Activist Fund, a mutual fund that invests in a portfolio of activist investments.",

(Photo by: Jeffrey Greenberg/Universal Images Group via Getty Images)Jeff Greenberg | Universal Images Group | Getty ImagesThe U.S. Federal Reserve cut key interest rates by 25 basis points, lowering borrowing costs for the third time in 2025. Given the lower interest rate backdrop (which reduces the appeal of fixed-income investments) and a volatile stock market, some investors might want to consider adding dividend stocks to their portfolios to ensure stable income and enhance overall returns.The stock picks of top Wall Street analysts can help investors select attractive dividend-paying companies.Here are three dividend-paying stocks, highlighted by Wall Street's top pros, as tracked by TipRanks, a platform that ranks analysts based on their past performance. Devon EnergyThis week's first dividend pick is Devon Energy (DVN), an independent oil and natural gas exploration and production (E&P) company. In the third quarter of 2025, Devon returned $401 million to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. The company's fixed quarterly dividend of $0.24 per share (annualized dividend of $0.96 per share) indicates a yield of 2.5%.Recently, JP Morgan analyst Arun Jayaram upgraded Devon Energy stock to buy from hold, though he lowered the price target to $44 from $49. TipRanks' AI Analyst has an \"outperform\" rating on DVN stock with a price target of $43.Jayaram explained that his rating upgrade was based on DVN's compelling valuation compared to its peers, supported by free cash flow gains from the company's $1 billion business optimization plan. The 5 star analyst noted that Devon achieved about 60% of its $1 billion goal in a little over half a year following the plan's formal rollout.The analyst noted that Devon's Delaware Basin well productivity was adversely impacted by the company's focus on completing a higher proportion of Wolfcamp B wells. That said, Jayaram expects well productivity to be stable in 2026 and 2027 due to a \"steadier mix of secondary zones\" compared to 2025.Overall, Jayaram is bullish on Devon, given that it has a top-quality acreage position in the most important parts of the Delaware Basin, Bakken, and Eagle Ford shale regions. Moreover, the company has the option to expand in the STACK and Powder River Basins.\"We believe DVN's core franchise assets have the potential to provide a large inventory of lower-risk, high rate-of-return development drilling opportunities that are critical given the depleting nature of an E&P's asset base,\" said Jayaram.Jayaram ranks No. 655 among more than 10,100 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been profitable 59% of the time, delivering an average return of 10.3%.

In the third quarter of 2025, EOG paid $545 million in regular dividends and repurchased shares worth $440 million. Last month, EOG announced a quarterly dividend of $1.02 per share, payable on January 30, 2026. At an annualized dividend of $4.08, EOG's yield stands at 3.7%.Siebert Williams Shank analyst Gabriele Sorbara reaffirmed a buy rating on EOG stock with a price target of $150. The stock also scores an \"outperform\" rating from TipRanks' AI Analyst, with a price target of $127.Sorbara views EOG as a \"premier\" large-cap company with the ability to navigate through commodity cycles, supported by its solid balance sheet and strong inventory. The analyst also noted the company's massive free cash flow-generating capabilities.Notably, Sorbara highlighted EOG's commitment to return at least 70% of its free cash flow to shareholders annually through dividends and share buybacks. In fact, the energy company has the flexibility to return 100% of free cash flow based on its balance sheet strength.The 5-star analyst also noted EOG's efforts to leverage advanced technology to capture further opportunities in the Delaware Basin, with the company now identifying more than nine different development targets. Among other positives, Sorbara also mentioned that EOG is tracking ahead of its target for the first year with regard to the $150 million synergies from its Encino acquisition. More savings are expected from factors like improved infrastructure, production efficiency, and marketing deals through EOG's midstream network.Sorbara ranks No. 225 among more than 10,100 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been successful 61% of the time, delivering an average return of 18.4%. See EOG Resources Ownership Structure on TipRanks. CVS HealthFinally, let's look at pharmacy chain CVS Health (CVS). The company's turnaround efforts are helping it drive improved performance in a challenging business backdrop. At its Investor Day event on December 9, CVS Health provided positive updates and stated that it expects to achieve a mid-teens adjusted earnings per share (EPS) compound annual growth rate (CAGR) through 2028. At a quarterly dividend of $0.665 per share (annualized dividend of $2.66 per share), CVS stock offers a yield of 3.4%.Following Investor Day, Mizuho analyst Ann Hynes reiterated a Buy rating on CVS stock and raised her price target to $95 from $88. \"CVS is our top pick in our coverage universe,\" said the 5-star analyst, and cited structural improvement in retail earnings forecast as the reason for her revised price target. Interestingly, TipRanks' AI Analyst has a \"neutral\" rating on CVS with a price target of $81.Hynes noted that CVS' mid-teens adjusted EPS CAGR target does not take into account any additional share buybacks, which she expects to take place once the company achieves its leverage targets, possibly by the end of next year.The analyst also highlighted the company's efforts to improve margins of the Healthcare Benefits (HCB) segment, which has been under pressure due to a continued rise in the medical loss ratio (MLR). This ratio is expected to decline by about 50 basis points in 2026 due to better pricing, reduced benefits under Medicare Advantage (MA) plans, and the company's decision to exit the Health Insurance Exchange (HIX) business.Hynes also noted the improvement in CVS' Pharmacy and Consumer Wellness (PCW) segment outlook, with the company now expecting flat adjusted operating income growth compared to the previous guidance of a mid-single-digit decline. This improvement is driven by market share gains, a better reimbursement backdrop, and cost savings.Hynes ranks No. 733 among more than 10,100 analysts tracked by TipRanks. Her ratings have been successful 60% of the time, delivering an average return of 8.5%. See CVS Health Options Activity on TipRanks.",

    "body": "watch nowStock Chart IconStock chart iconTilray Brands, 1-dayPresident Donald Trump is expected to issue an executive order as soon as Monday that would allow for reclassification of marijuana, a person familiar with the matter told CNBC. The person asked not to be named because they are not authorized to speak about the White House's plans.Such a move would allow cannabis companies to fall under different tax regulations and encourage investment.Cannabis stocks took a leg up in Friday's midday trading following CNBC's report.The Washington Post first reported Thursday that Trump was expected to use an executive order to instruct federal agencies to reclassify marijuana as a less-regulated Schedule III drug from a Schedule I. Axios reported that the potential reclassification of marijuana — out of a group that includes heroin and into a lower tier of less dangerous drugs, such as steroids and Tylenol with codeine — would take place early next year.Trump floated a change in marijuana's classification in August.\"Trump rescheduling marijuana was not an if, in our assessment, but a when,\" Ed Groshans of Compass Point, a middle-market investment bank, wrote to clients in a Friday note.More optimismGroshans said the reported change would be \"positive\" for the cannabis industry, allowing banks to serve the sector.He said he expects that if Trump orders cannabis to be rescheduled, the Drug Enforcement Administration would finalize a proposed rule for the reclassification by the summer.Bill Kirk, senior research analyst at Roth, said he's also monitoring whether the Supreme Court decides next week to hear a case on state regulations and federal prohibition of cannabis. A positive ruling for the industry in that case could speed up regulatory timelines.The industry sees the latest moves as a sign of progress to normalize pot under national law.\"I'm a lot more optimistic than I ever have been,\" Tilray CEO Irwin Simon told CNBC. Shawn Hauser, partner at cannabis-focused law firm Vicente LLP, said a reclassification would mark only a \"partial victory,\" as the sector will need to continue fighting for legalization. However, she said the momentum can press Congress to create a regulatory framework that offers broader changes around safety, access and criminal justice reform than what a rescheduling provides.\"This [is] the beginning of a new era of public health policy,\" Hauser said. \"If implemented, it dismantles nearly a century of outdated drug policies that fly in the face of science and medicine.\"Pot stocks have struggled since a brief mania around public growers and dispensaries in the years before Covid, even as cannabis has received broader acceptance and some states have eased their classifications.Tilray shares were recently trading at a little more than $10 after peaking at more than $2,140, adjusted for splits, in September 2018.

    "body": "watch nowEverything is bigger in Texas. That's also true for data center demand in the Lone Star State, where project developers are rushing to cash in on the artificial intelligence boom.  Cheap land and cheap energy are combining to attract a flood of data center developers to the state. The potential demand is so vast that it will be impossible to meet by the end of the decade, energy experts say. Speculative projects are clogging up the pipeline to connect to the electric grid, making it difficult to see how much demand will actually materialize, they say. But investors will be left on the hook if inflated demand forecasts lead to more infrastructure being built than is actually needed. \"It definitely looks, smells, feels — is acting like a bubble,\" said Joshua Rhodes, a research scientist at the University of Texas at Austin and a founder of energy consulting firm IdeaSmiths.  \"The top line numbers are almost laughable,\" Rhodes said. More than 220 gigawatts of big projects have asked to connect to the Texas electric grid by 2030, according to December data from the Electric Reliability Council of Texas. More than 70% of those projects are data centers, according to ERCOT, which manages the Texas power grid. That's more than twice the Lone Star State's record peak summer demand this year of around 85 gigawatts, and its total available power generation for the season of around 103 gigawatts. Those figures are \"crazy big,\" said Beth Garza, a former ERCOT watchdog.\"There's not enough stuff to serve that much load on the equipment side or the consumption side,\" said Garza, director of ERCOT's independent market monitor from 2014 to 2019. Rhodes agreed. \"There's just no way we can physically put this much steel in the ground to match those numbers. I don't even know if China could do it that fast,\" he said.  'Not all real'Data center requests have exploded in Texas since state legislation in 2023 required projects that have not signed electric connection agreements to be considered in power demand forecasts. The number of big projects requesting an electric connection has nearly quadrupled this year. But more than half of them, representing about 128 gigawatts of increased potential demand, have not submitted studies for ERCOT to review yet. About another 90 gigawatts are either under review or have had planning studies approved. \"We know it's not all real. The question is how much is real,\" said Michael Hogan, a senior advisor at the Regulatory Assistance Project, which advises governments and regulators on energy policy.The huge numbers in Texas reflect a broader data center bubble in the U.S., said Hogan, who has worked in the electric industry for more than four decades, starting at General Electric in 1980.  \"As with everything else in Texas, it's an outsized example of it,\" he said. The number of projects that have actually connected to the grid or have been approved by ERCOT is much smaller, at only around 7.5 gigawatts. It is still a large number, equivalent to nearly eight large nuclear plants. But Texas can meet that level of demand, Rhodes said. \"We could comfortably grow 8 gigawatts of data centers,\" Rhodes said. Texas might be able to meet 20 gigawatts or 30 gigawatts of data center demand by 2030, he said. Texas has acted to separate serious data center projects from those that are merely speculative. A law passed in May requires developers to pay $100,000 for the initial study of their project and show that a site is secured through an ownership interest or lease. And they have to disclose whether they have outlined the same project anywhere else in Texas. The Texas Public Utility Commission has proposed a rule that would require data centers to pay $50,000 security per megawatt of peak power. The cost to a developer would total at least $50 million for a gigawatt-scale data center. \"The serious developers with long-term contracts signed with anchor tenants, they're going to be willing to put that money down,\" Rhodes said. More speculative developers will likely drop out of the line for an electric connection, which will help authorities get a more accurate forecast, he said. Risk to investorsThe risk is that electric infrastructure such as power plants, transmission lines and transformers will be built for speculative data centers that either do not materialize or use less electricity than anticipated, Rhodes said. And overbuilding would come at time when the cost of that infrastructure has soared as data centers and other industries all compete for the same scarce equipment, he said.\"When the bubble bursts, who pays is going to depend on how much steel has been moved,\" Rhodes said. The cost of a natural gas plant, for example, has more than doubled over the past five years, he said. \"It's kind of like buying your house at the top of the market,\" the analyst said. \"If the house price goes down in five years, you're out of luck.\" watch nowThe cost of building new power plants to serve the Texas electric market is generally borne by investors, Rhodes and Hogan said, providing some protection to households from higher electricity prices if too much capacity is built.  By contrast, electric prices have spiked in some Midwestern and mid-Atlantic states from data center demand because the grid operator, PJM Interconnection, buys power generation years in advance — with the burden falling on consumers.  In Illinois, where the northern part of the state is served by PJM, residential electricity prices rose about 20% in September compared to the same month last year. But prices in Texas increased just 5% year over year, below the average national increase of more than 7%, according to data from the Energy Information Administration.  Texas has less risk of building too much generation compared to PJM states because of the way the market is structured, Hogan said. But \"whatever [new] build we do end up seeing in Texas, the people who ended up investing in the excess capacity are the ones that are going to suffer,\" he said.  ",

    "body": "watch nowHoliday shopping has always felt like a \"chore\" for Amrita Bhasin. Between deciding what to buy, comparing prices and checking reviews, the 24-year-old retail tech CEO said she spent more than 15 hours each year buying gifts for her friends and family, a process that took the joy out of giving. But this year, Bhasin said she did all of her shopping in a fraction of the time and even had a little \"fun\" — all thanks to her new personal assistant: ChatGPT. \"I feel like I've got that physical store associate that I'm talking to, so I feel like I'm getting better recommendations. I actually think my tendency to buy is higher because of ChatGPT,\" Bhasin, based in Menlo Park, California, told CNBC. \"It has really changed the game.\" Bhasin is one of the many shoppers turning to AI platforms like OpenAI's ChatGPT, Google's Gemini and Perplexity this holiday season to help them buy gifts for their loved ones, and maybe a few for themselves, too. Whether consumers use them to get gift ideas or compare prices, AI platforms are poised to reshape the shopping experience and drive billions in revenue this holiday season as it becomes harder to get discovered on traditional search platforms.In a report published last month, Salesforce said it expects AI to drive a staggering $263 billion in global online holiday sales this year, representing 21% of all holiday orders. Though estimates vary widely, surveys conducted by Visa, Zeta Global and other organizations found that between 40% and 83% of consumers plan to use AI for shopping this holiday season. Meanwhile, AI traffic to U.S. retail sites surged 760% between Nov. 1 and Dec. 1, according to Adobe. While AI shopping is in its early stages, initial reads on how shoppers are interacting with it show the opportunity it can bring for retailers. Shoppers arriving on retail websites from generative AI platforms are 30% more likely to buy something and about 14% more engaged than those coming from non-AI sources, meaning they're spending more time on the site and are less likely to leave immediately, Adobe found. These AI-fueled shopping visits now generate 8% more revenue per session, the firm found. AI tools can also help shoppers spot deals and aid lesser-known brands in getting discovered — about half of the gifts Bhasin bought this year came from brands she'd never shopped before.\"It's where consumers are going, because they're just asking questions around, like, 'Hey, where can I find the best gift under $20 for my niece that cares about these things?'\" said Kimberly Shenk, the founder and CEO of Novi, a tech firm that helps brands adjust to AI shopping. Emily Park | CNBCThe surge in AI shopping has led retailers big and small to rethink their strategies to ensure they're showing up where customers expect them to be. Walmart and Amazon have each launched their own AI shopping assistants, and others, including Walmart, Target and Etsy, have partnered with OpenAI so customers can search for items or buy products without leaving ChatGPT. Apparel retailer PacSun said it hopes to join OpenAI's platform and in the meantime is reformatting its website so its teen-friendly clothes will show up in AI searches. Others are changing their budgets, directing funds away from SEO, or search engine optimization, and into AEO, or answer engine optimization, and hiring outside firms to help them navigate the shift. Shenk said her company has seen a \"major surge in demand\" from retailers and brands that have started to see a steep decline in traffic from social media ads and search engines.\"I've heard so many brands talking about their paid advertising in Meta and all these different places really just not performing and ultimately seeing a ton of that transition over to AI mode in Google, ChatGPT, Perplexity,\" Shenk said. \"I think people were caught off guard … so brands are really scrambling to figure out, 'How do I know if I'm visible? I have no idea if I'm even showing up. I have no idea how I'm showing up, but I'm seeing all my traffic drop off, and I got to figure that out. Now.'\" Brands are walking a tightrope. They have to adjust to consumers who are using AI to discover products, but still be present through traditional channels for those who prefer old-fashioned shopping. While AI companies and retailers themselves have made massive investments in the chatbot shopping experience, some consumers also say it doesn't yet measure up to searching for gifts themselves.Walmart, Target and others join the AI race As more shoppers start their gift searches on AI chatbots, some of the country's biggest retailers, including Walmart, Target and Etsy, have announced their own strategies to try to attract customers through AI assistants.Walmart announced a deal in October with OpenAI that will enable shoppers to both find and buy items without leaving ChatGPT. Yet the big-box retailer hasn't shared a launch date.Etsy and many Shopify merchants, including Glossier, have also signed deals with OpenAI for its Instant Checkout feature, which will initially allow customers in the U.S. to make single-item purchases. Instant Checkout launched with Etsy in late September, and ChatGPT has begun to roll out a few Shopify merchants, including Skims, Vuori and Spanx, an OpenAI spokesperson said.Target announced a deal last month to allow customers to shop Target's app within ChatGPT. The beta feature enables shoppers to purchase multiple items in a single transaction, including groceries, and choose if they want delivery or curbside pickup.On the other hand, Amazon — an online retail behemoth where many shoppers begin their product search — has taken the opposite approach. It has moved to block external AI chatbots, including those developed by OpenAI, Google and Meta, from crawling its website to try to stop them from pulling in product listings as part of their answers.Amazon has gone a step further by sending a cease-and-desist letter to Perplexity AI to try to prevent users of its AI browser, Comet, from purchasing its items. The startup described Amazon's legal threat as \"bullying.\"Read moreAlong with their different strategies with outside tech companies, Amazon, Walmart and Target are among the retailers who have built their own AI-powered chatbots in the hopes of reeling in curious shoppers during the holiday season and beyond. On Walmart's app, customers are greeted by a yellow smiley-faced agent called Sparky that can answer questions and recommend products. Amazon has a shopping assistant called Rufus. And Target has an AI-powered tool, Target Gift Finder, for the second holiday season in a row.On Walmart's earnings call in November, CEO Doug McMillon said agentic AI will be one of the growth drivers for the retailer's e-commerce business. He said the technology will \"help people save time and have more fun shopping.\"Walmart has added other capabilities for Sparky, such as recommended shopping lists for parties. Incoming CEO John Furner also said the assistant will eventually be able to remind customers about items they may want to reorder.Tracy Poulliot, senior vice president of shopping experiences for Walmart U.S., told CNBC that \"customers are really starting to rely on these GenAI assistants to take on more of a problem-solving approach than your traditional item-by-item search experience.\"So far, Target said, thousands of customer have used its Gift Finder, with common searches about sports, beauty and wellness, cooking and apparel gifts. In a statement, the company said it had early insights that the tool was driving higher engagement and larger shopping carts than the year prior.Prat Vemana, Target's chief information and product officer, said the retailer is already seeing changes in how customers are looking for items on its website and app. About 25% of its customer searches are descriptive and conversational in phrasing, rather than keyword-based, he said.How retailers are overhauling digital marketingShopping research feature in ChatGPT.Courtesy: ChatGPTSince the dawn of online search, SEO has guided online marketing strategies and evolved into a game of stuffing relevant keywords into the back end of product listings to ensure they pop up on Google.For example, if a shopper was looking for a new green sweater, Googling \"green sweater\" would bring up a slew of product matches from retailers, with some links appearing higher than others if they were sponsored. \"You pay somebody and you spend money, you get yourself listed on top,\" said Shirley Gao, the chief digital and information officer at PacSun. \"Now [with AI], there's no way you can pay anybody. This is very authentic.\" When searching for products on an AI platform, a consumer might write a few sentences, explaining the event they need the product for and sharing their preferences, location, body type and size. The AI platform then hunts for credible information to ensure it's a product worth buying. It looks for keywords, but also other data like reviews, credible media reports and information about the item's materials. OpenAI's ChatGPT ranks results based on what best matches the shopper's request, not based on ads, paid placement or whether a company has a business deal with OpenAI, a spokesperson said. Retailers who are partners with ChatGPT provide OpenAI with direct product feeds, which help make sure listings are more up-to-date. In some cases, they are integrated to allow for Instant Checkout in the chat.ChatGPT decides how to rank merchants who sell the same product by considering factors including availability, price, quality, whether a merchant is the primary seller and whether Instant Checkout is enabled, the company spokesperson said.Brands CNBC spoke with said this evolution is forcing them to rethink their entire media, content and e-commerce strategies. SEO still matters — but the information they're putting on the back end of their websites is evolving.Gao said her team has been reformatting PacSun's website so it's easier for AI platforms to read it, including through new gift and style guide pages. She said those product listings share more details like item specifications and customer feedback.In an interview with CNBC, Target's Vemana said the retailer historically tracked how it showed up in customers' online searches. Now, he said, it wants to make sure it shows up better in AI chatbots' search results.To increase visibility, he said, Target is providing richer descriptions of its merchandise, such as listing unique features like sustainable fabrics or explaining how a product fits into a trend or theme.A shopper at a Target store ahead of Black Friday in Jersey City, New Jersey, US, on Tuesday, Nov. 25, 2025. Michael Nagle | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesMichael Wieder, a Brooklyn-based dad who co-founded baby and toddler goods retailer Lalo, said he and his team have spent time considering the questions people could be putting into AI platforms and ensuring product listings answer them.For example, instead of keyword stuffing product listings with basic attributes like the material, size and color of the item, his team has been putting in more detailed information like \"good for small spaces,\" \"great for apartment living\" or \"best gifts for kids under one year old.\" \"I'm looking for the best gift for a child that is, you know, this age that lives in this place,\" Wieder said in an interview. \"We're taking it a step further in how we construct the infrastructure of our website and the content that lives within our website.\" Ethique Beauty, which sells shampoo and conditioner bars in retailers like Ulta Beauty, Wegmans and Whole Foods, has \"completely changed\" its approach to search, leading to a 90% increase in traffic from AI platforms in the past six months, CEO Erica Cocilova said in an interview.\"When you're thinking about what you need as a consumer, your shopping doesn't necessarily start with products,\" Cocilova said. \"People are searching for things like, 'I need scalp health,' right? Or 'my scalp is flaky. I'm struggling with oily scalp. My hair is too dry.' They're looking for solutions.\" Cocilova and her team combed through the business's customer service FAQs, talked to shoppers, examined reviews and scoured the internet to get a better idea of what shampoo customers sought. Then, they added more information to product listings, including brand certifications and details about the company's supply chain.They also took the biggest questions consumers had — like \"how to sleep with curly hair\" — and created blog posts answering them. \"Any hair brand could be talking about that, but we talk about it in a way that's got super dense, rich content and then ties it back to how our products are different and address the needs for curls,\" Cocilova said. The changes have led more shoppers to Ethique's products through its own website and its partners, and the company has enjoyed a boost in sales. Even so, the shift to optimizing for AI search has required a steep investment in both internal staff and consulting relative to SEO, a cost other businesses have also had to take on as they try to stay relevant.\"What I would say is the return is better, because the person that ends up on your site, or any site, to shop is just that much more educated,\" she said. \"They're not getting to your site and having to do as much research, right? They're there to shop.\" When AI falls short Though AI platforms are pointing many shoppers in the right direction, not every tool hits the mark. When CNBC asked Target's Gift Finder for ideas based on personalized scenarios, the chatbot answered with links to gift guides and repeated itself instead of delivering specific product recommendations.Through a company spokesperson, Target said the chatbot's results include \"a variety of gift recommendation items grouped by category.\" He said the company's tool is learning from the customer interactions and that Target is regularly updating its algorithms While AI platforms can be effective when people need to do product research or are looking for something highly specific, some consumers prefer the traditional shopping experience.Diana Tan, a 39-year-old startup founder based in Seattle, asked ChatGPT to help her build a capsule wardrobe earlier this year and provided a slew of information about her body type, preferences and budget. Instead of a curated set of options, she said she was repeatedly served boring basics like black shirts, gray pants and black turtlenecks.\"It just became almost like talking to a demented grandmother, where you're just constantly trying to remind it, 'Okay, I really want something that is in this price range. No, this is too expensive. Please stop sending me this,'\" Tan said. \"And then they'll come at me like, 'Here's a black turtleneck again.' Okay. No. Please stop sending me black turtlenecks. I really didn't want this the first time.\"Ultimately, Tan gave up.\"I think it takes the joy out of shopping,\" she said. \"So much of shopping is still very much just browsing. … After a while, I'm like, well, you know, it's actually more fun and more interesting for me to just go to Nordstrom Rack, or, like, anywhere else, and just look for what I actually want.\"",

This administration is working diligently to ensure that aliens in our country illegally can no longer fly unless it is out of our country to self-deport.\"The Times said that it is not known how many people have been arrested as a result of TSA's information sharing.But the newspaper said it had obtained documents that indicate the program led to the Nov. 20 arrest at Boston's Logan Airport of a college student, Any Lucía López Belloza, who was deported to Honduras two days later. López had been on her way to visit her family in Texas for the Thanksgiving holiday.The Times previously reported that López was brought to the United States from Honduras at age 7, and that her family said neither they nor she knew she was subject to a deportation order.",

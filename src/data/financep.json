    "body": "A logo sits illuminated outside the Cisco booth at ISE 2024 on January 30, 2024 in Barcelona, Spain.Cesc Maymo | Getty ImagesCisco Systems shares closed 12% lower Thursday as rising memory prices put pressure on the networking company's margins. It's the stock's worst day since 2022.Strong demand for artificial intelligence data centers has led to a global shortage of memory, which has caused costs to skyrocket for the component. Large orders for data center memory have limited production capacity for other devices, including smartphones.This has created uncertainty for a number of tech companies, including consumer electronics makers like Apple and Dell as well as chipmakers like Qualcomm, which cited the shortage when it issued weak guidance on Feb. 4. Now, Cisco is feeling the pinch. Cisco CEO Chuck Robbins addressed memory price increases across the market on the company's earnings call on Wednesday. Robbins said Cisco will raise prices, revise contracts and negotiate terms to account for the evolving component prices. \"In terms of memory, we're going to control what we can control,\" Cisco finance chief Mark Patterson said on the call.The company reported better-than-expected quarterly results on Wednesday, but shares dropped about 7% as Cisco issued a mediocre forecast.Product gross margin for the quarter was 66.4%, down 130 bps from the year prior, which Patterson said was \"primarily driven by negative impacts from mix and higher memory costs.\"Read more CNBC tech newsTech IPO hype gets drowned out on Wall Street by prospect of $1 trillion in debt salesFTC tells Tim Cook to look into reports Apple News is censoring conservativesAnthropic closes $30 billion funding round as cash keeps flowing into top AI startupsWaymo begins deploying next-gen Ojai robotaxis to extend its U.S. lead",

    "body": "watch nowShares of Airbnb were up about 2% in extended trading Thursday after the company reported fourth-quarter results that beat expectations for revenue and offered rosy guidance for the current period.Here's how the company did based on analysts' estimates compiled by LSEG:Earnings per share: 56 cents vs. 66 cents expectedRevenue: $2.78 billion vs. $2.72 billion expectedFor the current period, Airbnb said it expects to report revenue of $2.59 billion to $2.63 billion. Analysts were expecting $2.53 billion for the quarter, according to LSEG. The company said it expects full-year revenue growth of \"at least low double digits.\" Analysts were expecting 10.2% growth.Airbnb's revenue increased 12% during the fourth quarter from $2.48 billion during the same period last year. Airbnb has beat Wall Street's revenue expectations for 20 of the past 21 quarters, according to FactSet.The company reported net income of $341 million, or 56 cents per share, down from $461 million, or 73 cents per share, a year earlier. Airbnb attributed the lower figure to $90 million of non-income tax matters and planned investments in new growth and policy initiatives, according to a release.  Airbnb said it finished 2025 with \"strong momentum,\" and that its results reflect the strength of its core business. The company connects users who are willing to rent out their homes with travelers who are looking for places to stay. The company reported 121.9 million nights and seats booked in the fourth quarter, up 10% from a year ago and above the 117.6 million expected by StreetAccount.Gross booking value, which Airbnb uses to report host earnings, service fees, cleaning fees and taxes, totaled $20.4 billion in the fourth quarter, up 16% year over year. That figure is above the $19.4 billion expected by analysts polled by StreetAccount.Airbnb reported adjusted EBITDA — earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization — of $786 million during the period.Last month, Airbnb announced it hired Ahmad Al-Dahle, former head of generative artificial intelligence at Meta, as its new tech chief. Airbnb's previous technology chief, Ari Balogh, stepped down in December after more than seven years at the company.WATCH: Airbnb CEO Brian Chesky on new CTO: We have an opportunity to do AI right for travel and e-commercewatch now",

    "body": "Tractor trailers sit parked at a J.B. Hunt Transport Services Inc. facility in Columbus, Ohio.Luke Sharrett | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesShares of several trucking and logistics companies declined Thursday on fears that new artificial intelligence tools could slash major freight inefficiencies, leading to less demand for the industry's services.A new tool from AI company Algorhythm Holdings has made trucking companies the latest victim of the market's AI jitters, adding to the historic sell-off in software stocks and real estate companies. The notable market rotation has come as investors are increasingly scrutinizing traditional businesses that may not be able to keep up with rapid advancements in AI.Leading trucking and logistics stocks C.H. Robinson and RXO dropped 14.5% and 20.5%, respectively, during Thursday's session. J.B. Hunt Transportation Services declined about 5%, while XPO lost nearly 6% and logistics company Expeditors International of Washington fell about 13.2%.There's an \"emerging debate around open-source automation agents such as Molt Bot that offer increased potential to automate routine back-office tasks and help equalize the technology playing field for smaller operators,\" said Baird analyst Daniel Moore in a note. He reiterated his outperform ratings on C.H. Robinson and Expeditors, saying \"automation is not a new theme.\"Shares of Algorhythm, a penny stock before Thursday, popped 29.9%, meanwhile.Algorhythm announced earlier this week that its SemiCab's platform, deployed with live customers, is allowing operators to scale freight volumes by 300% to 400% without increasing their headcount. According to its press release, the SemiCab platform reduces \"empty freight miles\" by more than 70% across active customer networks. The company said that trucks are driving empty nearly one out of every three miles and therefore lose more than $1 trillion in freight spending each year, citing data from Mordor Intelligence.\"What we're proving with SemiCab is that when freight is managed as a coordinated network rather than isolated transactions, utilization improves dramatically. The substantial reduction in empty miles that we are able to achieve for our customers represents a fundamental shift in how logistics economics work,\" said Ajesh Kapoor, CEO of SemiCab.Algorhythm was previously focused on developing in-car karaoke systems, but sold its Singing Machine business to Stingray for $4.5 million in 2025 before pivoting to its AI freight platform.Separately, investors are watching to see how trucking companies could also be impacted by U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean P. Duffy's Wednesday ruling to prohibit, according to the announcement, \"unqualified foreign drivers\" from obtaining licenses to drive commercial trucks and buses. Duffy said that government reforms will seek to address safety concerns by preventing \"foreign drivers\" who have not undergone consular and interagency screening from receiving a commercial driver's license. Consular screening typically applies to non-U.S. citizens.",

    "body": "Ring security cameras are displayed on a shelf at a Target store on June 01, 2023 in Novato, California. Justin Sullivan | Getty ImagesRing is terminating its partnership with police tech provider Flock Safety, the Amazon-owned company announced Thursday.The partnership between Flock and Ring came under scrutiny after the Amazon doorbell company ran an ad during the Super Bowl that touted a \"Search Party\" feature that uses AI to help locate lost pets. The Electronic Frontier Foundation called the feature a \"surveillance nightmare.\"  Flock, meanwhile, operates a network of automated license plate readers, and sells access to that software to customers that include law enforcement agencies, such as Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Customs and Border Protection.Ring's decision to cancel its partnership with Flock comes as tech companies face growing pressure to reexamine their work with federal agencies. Earlier this week, Salesforce employees pressed CEO Marc Benioff to cancel \"ICE opportunities,\" CNBC reported. More than 900 Google employees also asked their company to divest itself from ICE and U.S. Customs and Border Protection.Privacy and civil liberties advocates called on Ring to drop its partnership with Flock. A protest calling on the e-commerce company to cut its ties with Flock, ICE and CBP is scheduled for Friday, outside of Amazon's Seattle headquarters. \"Following a comprehensive review, we determined the planned Flock Safety integration would require significantly more time and resources than anticipated,\" Ring wrote in a blog post. \"As a result, we have made the joint decision to cancel the planned integration.\"watch nowFlock representatives didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.Amazon acquired Ring for $839 million in 2018. The home security company is primarily known for its connected doorbell devices, which can record footage and alert users to activity around their home or business via an app.Ring has long sparked controversy about privacy due to its partnerships with police. In recent years, the company had adopted a softer image, positioning its devices as a tool to capture porch pirates and family-friendly hijinks. After founder Jamie Siminoff returned as CEO last year, the company has re-embraced its original mission of fighting crime. The Amazon company announced its partnership with Flock last October, giving owners of its video doorbells the option to share footage with law enforcement agencies that use the startup's software to assist with their \"evidence collection and investigative work.\" Flock's systems have been adopted by thousands of communities and law enforcement agencies across the country, and both ICE and CBP have increasingly accessed Flock's data as part of President Donald Trump's immigration crackdown.Ring spokesperson Emma Daniels said in a statement that the Flock partnership was never active, and the companies never announced a date for it to go live. \"No videos were ever shared between these services,\" Daniels said. The news was earlier reported by The Verge. ",

    "body": "watch nowRivian Automotive on Thursday beat Wall Street's fourth-quarter expectations and said it's targeting a significant increase in vehicle deliveries this year, but the automaker also cautioned that it will continue losing money as it launches its crucial R2 next-generation vehicle.Rivian's 2026 guidance includes increasing vehicle deliveries to between 62,000 and 67,000 units, which would be up by 47% to 59% compared with 2025. That increase is expected to be assisted by the launch of the R2 SUV during the second quarter.Rivian CEO RJ Scaringe told CNBC's Phil LeBeau on Thursday that the R2 is expected to be the \"majority of the volume\" of the business by the end of 2027, as it ramps up production at its sole factory in Normal, Illinois.The electric vehicle maker also said it expects adjusted pre-tax losses for 2026 of between $1.8 billion and $2.1 billion and capital expenditures between $1.95 billion and $2.05 billion. That compares with nearly $2.1 billion in adjusted pre-tax losses and $1.7 billion in capital expenditures last year.Scaringe described 2025 to investors Thursday as a \"foundational year\" for Rivian, while saying 2026 will mark \"an inflection point\" for the company.Shares of Rivian were up more than 15% during after-hours trading Thursday after closing at $14, down roughly 5%.watch nowHere's how the company performed in the fourth quarter compared with average estimates compiled by LSEG: Loss per share: 54 cents adjusted vs. a loss of 68 cents expectedRevenue: $1.29 billion vs. $1.26 billion expectedRivian's full-year 2025 revenue, including $1.7 billion during the fourth quarter, was up 8% compared with $4.97 billion in 2024.The company was able to achieve its first annual gross profit, which is closely watched by investors, of $144 million in 2025, including $120 million during the fourth quarter. That was driven by its software and services joint venture with Volkswagen offsetting $432 million in losses for its automotive business last year.This year's gross profit may not be as fruitful, with Rivian CFO Claire McDonough describing it as a \"transition year\" as it ramps up R2 production.Investors view gross profit as a key indicator of a business's profitability before operating expenses, interest and taxes.Rivian's net loss last year was $3.6 billion, an improvement from a loss of $4.75 billion in 2024. That includes an $804 million loss during the fourth quarter, accelerated by a decrease in earnings from the sale of regulatory credits, which was expected after changes by the Trump administration to federal fuel economy and emissions standards.Rivian ended the fourth quarter with $6.59 billion in total liquidity, including nearly $6.1 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments.It's needed capital for Rivian. This year is a crucial one for the automaker as it attempts to deliver on promises of technological advancements and improved profitability with the R2. The roughly $45,000 midsize vehicle, per Rivian, is expected to cut build material costs in half, reduce production complexity and significantly grow demand and sales.Rivian said the R2 is expected to initially be produced by one plant shift, followed by a second shift by the end of this year. The company said additional R2 details by model such as pricing, options and more will be available on March 12.Rivian has made important strides with its first-generation R1 pickup and SUV, but the market for such pricey EVs, which both start in the $70,000s, has slowed. It also continues to produce an all-electric delivery van, historically purchased by its largest shareholder, Amazon.",

    "body": "Dado Ruvic | ReutersPinterest shares plunged as much as 20% after hours Thursday as CEO Bill Ready said the company \"absorbed an exogenous shock this year related to tariffs\" that affected top retail advertisers.The company reported a fourth-quarter earnings miss, revenue that was roughly in line with expectations and issued weak guidance for the current period.Here's how the company did, compared to analysts' consensus estimates from LSEG:Earnings per share: 67 cents adjusted vs. 69 cents expectedRevenue: $1.32 billion vs. $1.33 billion expectedReady told analysts on Thursday that the company is \"not satisfied with our Q4 revenue performance, and believe it does not reflect what Pinterest can deliver over time.\"The company's fourth-quarter sales rose 14% year-to-year. Net income for the fourth quarter came in at $277 million, down 85% from a year prior, when net income was $1.85 billion and included a deferred tax benefit.  This is the second quarter in a row in which Pinterest shed a fifth of its value after delivering Wall Street disappointing results. The impact of tariffs on large retailers \"created a more meaningful headwind than we expected,\" Pinterest finance chief Julia Donnelly said on the call with analysts. Those retailers also pulled back on ad spend in Europe, she said.The retail sector has been reeling from President Donald Trump's ongoing trade war, which raised the price of shipping costs. The trade war has also led to companies charging customers higher prices and reducing the number of products they can put on the market. Besides implementing layoffs, the retail sector also pulled back on advertising to deal with the ongoing trade issues.Pinterest said it expects first-quarter sales to come in between $951 million to $971 million, trailing analyst estimates of $980 million.\"Looking ahead to Q1, we expect these headwinds will continue and may become slightly more pronounced in Q1, including in the U.K. and in Europe,\" Donnelly said.Pinterest recorded $541.5 million in adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or EBIDTA. That figure fell short of the $550 million that analysts were projecting.While Pinterest sees \"opportunity over the long term\" from large advertisers, Ready said \"the near-term outlook for this cohort on our platform remains pressured given these headwinds.\"The company plans to more heavily court small-to-medium-sized and international advertisers so its core online ad business doesn't rely so heavily on large retailers, Ready said.\"Most importantly, we need to further broaden our revenue mix and accelerate the next phase of our sales and go-to-market transformation,\" he said.The disappointing results come after the company in January announced that  it would lay off less than 15% of its workforce and reduce its office space in an effort to shift resources to technical teams prioritizing the development of \"AI-powered products and capabilities.\"Pinterest then fired staffers who built a tool to quantify the layoffs, and Ready admonished them during a companywide meeting, saying that \"there's a clear line between constructive debate and behavior that's obstructionist,\" CNBC reported.The January restructuring and ongoing sales unit overhaul \"may cause some near term disruption, which we factored into our guidance to be prudent,\" Donnelly said on Thursday. Despite the results and gloomy outlook, Pinterest said that fourth-quarter global monthly active users jumped 12% year-over-year to 619 million, representing an all-time high. Wall Street was expecting that figure to be 613 million.Fourth quarter sales in the U.S. and Canada region came in at $979 million, which was ahead of StreetAccount's estimates of $973 million.WATCH: Magnificent 7 trade is broken and reversing.watch now",

Certain pockets of the U.S. stock market have been hit this year by the release of AI tools that could replicate their businesses — or at least eat into their profit margins.Shares of several trucking and logistics companies declined on fears that new AI tools could slash major freight inefficiencies, leading to less demand for the industry's services.Real estate and financial stocks were also casualties, with commercial real estate brokers extending losses for a second straight day.Investors in Asia were watching for any spillover effects, though Taiwan — the most prominent market in the AI space — was closed for the Lunar New Year holiday.

    "body": "watch nowHigh home prices, faltering supply and weaker consumer confidence in the economy all continue to weigh on the U.S. housing market. The chief economist for the National Association of Realtors, Lawrence Yun, is calling it \"a new housing crisis.\"Sales of previously owned homes in January dropped a much wider-than-expected 8.4% from December to a seasonally adjusted, annualized rate of 3.91 million, according to the NAR. Sales were 4.4% lower than January 2025. That is the slowest pace since December 2023 and the biggest monthly drop since February 2022.This count is based on closings, so contracts that were likely signed in November and December, when the average rate on the 30-year fixed mortgage didn't move much before dropping slightly in January. That rate is now 6.1%, according to Mortgage News Daily. Regionally, sales fell across the nation month to month but were down the most in the South and West. \"Affordability conditions are improving, with NAR's Housing Affordability Index showing that housing is the most affordable it's been since March 2022,\" Yun said in a release. \"This is due to wage gains outpacing home price growth and mortgage rates being lower than a year ago. However, supply has not kept pace and remains quite low.\"But he also noted on a call with reporters that potential buyers are \"still struggling,\" and \"renters are not participating in housing wealth.\" He characterized the current market as a crisis because, \"the movement is not happening. Americans are stuck.\"Get Property Play directly to your inboxCNBC's Property Play with Diana Olick covers new and evolving opportunities for the real estate investor, delivered weekly to your inbox.Subscribe here to get access today.Inventory came down in January from December but was still up 3.4% year over year. There were 1.22 million homes for sale at the end of January, which at the current sales pace is a 3.7-month supply. A six-month supply is considered a balanced market between buyer and seller.Tighter supply kept home prices in positive territory. The median price for a home sold in January was $396,800, up 0.9% year over year and the highest January price on record. \"Homeowners are in a financially comfortable position as a result. Since January 2020, a typical homeowner would have accumulated $130,500 in housing wealth,\" Yun added.Homes are taking longer to sell, at 46 days in January versus 41 in January 2025. About 31% of sales were to first-time buyers, up from 28% a year ago. Sales continue to be strongest on the higher end of the market; in fact, the only price segment in the positive from a year ago was the $1 million-plus range. Sales dropped the most for homes priced below $250,000.",

    "body": "Swiss franc banknotes in Lausanne, Switzerland, on Dec. 23, 2025.Fabrice Coffrini | Afp | Getty ImagesAsk an investor to name safe-haven currencies, and most will say the U.S. dollar, the Swiss franc, and the Japanese yen.Investors historically expected them to hold their value during geopolitical or economic turbulence.But more recently, these currencies have experienced volatility themselves. The dollar and yen saw sharp declines over 2025 and into 2026. The franc has strengthened, but this is challenging for a country with unusually low inflation and a reliance on exports.Declining dollarU.S. President Donald Trump reordered global trade with tariffs in 2025, sparking a \"sell America\" trade: a sell-off of U.S. assets, including the dollar, the world's reserve currency.The suddenness with which other tariffs have been imposed and withdrawn kept the pressure up.In a December note, Swiss private bank Julius Baer stated that \"erratic trade policies\" were just one cause of the dollar's woes, adding that Trump's \"One Big Beautiful Bill Act\" put the U.S. on \"an unsustainable debt trajectory.\"Trump's pressure on U.S. Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell also undermined investors' confidence in the dollar, the note said.The dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of peers, tumbled 1.3% on Jan. 29 after Trump said the dollar is \"doing great,\" its sharpest drop in a day since Trump first announced tariffs in April. It took the greenback to its lowest level in almost four years.The index plunged 9.37% in 2025, and it has fallen further in 2026.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconIn a Wednesday note, George Saravelos, head of FX research at Deutsche Bank, said the dollar's safe-haven status was \"myth.\"He challenged the notion that the dollar \"rallies during risk-aversion,\" adding: \"A simple chart of the dollar-equity relationship shows this not to be true. The average USD-equity correlation has historically been closer to zero, and over the last year the dollar has once again de-correlated from the S&P.\"Cole Smead, CEO and portfolio manager at Smead Capital Management, told CNBC's \"Squawk Box Europe\" at the end of January that he sees further weakness ahead for the dollar.\"We're in a dollar bear market longer term,\" he said. \"If you go back and look at these 'American manias' [in markets], if you go back and look at the telecom bubble and tech bubble the late 1990s, the dollar peaked in 2002 and within six years, you saw the dollar go to a low it hadn't seen for [a] very, very long time.\"The U.S. dollar index nosedived by around 41% between 2002 and its 2008 low.Yieldless Yen The Japanese yen has seesawed across 2025, and rumors of intervention now swirl around Asia's safe-haven currency. At the start of 2025, the yen was worth about 156 against the dollar. It strengthened as the Bank of Japan started to signal it would continue to raise rates, but remained around 150 for most of the second and third quarters.It started to weaken sharply after October, when Sanae Takaichi became prime minister. Her expansionary fiscal policy stance prompted a selloff in the yen, pushing up long-term yields of Japanese government bonds. The yen has declined 5.9% between Takaichi's accession to Jan. 23, before a reported \"rate check\" by the New York Federal Reserve on the dollar/yen pair on Jan. 23 saw the currency strengthen sharply to about 152.However, the yen had started to weaken, heading toward the 157 level, before strengthening again after the LDP saw a landslide victory in Sunday's Lower House election.Citi analysts have said the yen is unlikely to weaken far beyond the 160 level, given this could prompt intervention by Japanese or U.S. authorities.\"The yen will approach the 160 level once more, but there will likely be a struggle between the market and the authorities near the 159 mark,\" Dutch bank ING said in a Feb. 9 note. U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has denied that the U.S. had intervened before the January rate check.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconFaltering FrancUnlike the dollar and yen, the Swiss franc's home country isn't big, but Switzerland's political stability, low debt and diversified economy make it a safe-haven asset. The hunt for stable assets over the last year has benefited it. It has held its value far more clearly than either the dollar or the yen. Over 2025, the franc gained almost 13% against the U.S. dollar. It has extended those gains into 2026, hitting an 11-year high against the greenback. It also touched on an 11-year high against the euro earlier this month. Stock Chart IconStock chart iconU.S. dollar/Swiss franc exchange rateThe franc's path has been completely turbulence-free. On Jan. 30, as gold and silver were gripped by a historic sell-off that wiped as much as 30% from the latter's value, investors also pivoted out of the Swiss franc, with the currency shedding about 1.2% versus the greenback.But this was one of only 10 trading days over the last year where it moved lower against the dollar. But that strength is causing problems in Switzerland — and, if it gets stronger, it could force an intervention from officials as they try to rein in the impact of a hot currency on the wider economy.Unusually among developed economies, Switzerland is battling sluggish price growth, and a strengthening franc could add further disinflationary pressure to the country's export-driven economy. The country's inflation rate is just 0.1%, and the Swiss National Bank's key interest rate is at 0%. With officials trying to avoid reinstating the unpopular negative rates policy of 2015 to 2022, the strengthening franc complicates the SNB's monetary policy picture.Swiss officials have previously intervened in the foreign exchange market by selling the franc and buying foreign currencies to help cool theirs. But doing this now comes with risks, with the Trump administration — in both its first and second iteration — taking issue with the SNB's interventions. SNB Chairman Martin Schlegel told CNBC's Karen Tso on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, last month that the bank is \"ready to intervene in the FX market if necessary.\"Economists at Swiss investment bank UBS — which forecasts the franc will lose around 2% against the dollar by the end of the year — said in a note on Wednesday that the SNB was unlikely to \"react forcefully\" to the rising currency.  \"Sporadic foreign exchange interventions are possible, but broad-based action is not warranted, in our view, given limited deflation risks, an optimistic global growth outlook, and moderate overvaluation of the CHF,\" they said.However, the bank also said in a separate report that it sees limited upside ahead for the franc. Economists polled by Reuters earlier this month said they saw the dollar clawing back 2.2% against the franc by the end of April.Matthew Ryan, head of market strategy at global financial services firm Ebury, told CNBC on Wednesday that the dollar and the yen \"have undoubtedly lost some of their sheen of late,\" while the Swiss franc has \"solidified itself as the premier safe-haven currency of choice.\"Lee Hardman, a UK-based currency analyst for Japanese bank MUFG, agreed that the safe haven appeal of both the yen and the dollar had been \"undermined\" by political turbulence. \"Over the long-term the [Swiss franc] has proven to be the best store of value among other G10 currencies including the JPY and USD,\" he said.",

    "body": "Cheng Xin | Getty ImagesInstacart shares climbed 14% during extended trading on Thursday after the grocery delivery company reported strong fourth-quarter revenue and forecast upbeat guidance.Here's how the company did versus LSEG estimates:Earnings per share: 30 cents vs. 52 cents expectedRevenue: $992 million vs. $974 million expectedFor the first quarter, Instacart expects gross transaction value, which tracks the value of goods sold, to range between $10.13 billion and $10.28 billion. That was ahead of StreetAccount's $9.97 billion estimate. The company expects adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization in the range of $280 million and $290 million, versus $277 million expected by StreetAccount.Revenue grew 12% from $883 million a year ago. Net income totaled $81 million, or 30 cents per share. The company reported adjusted EBITDA of $303 million, topping the $292 million expected by StreetAccount.In a letter to shareholders, CEO Chris Rogers said Instacart's technology and customer-oriented approach are driving more growth and engagement to the platform.\"Our execution on what matters most to customers is driving strong momentum on our marketplace, as well as our enterprise platform — which is a real, strategic advantage for us,\" he said. Instacart also said its operating expenses rose year over year \"due to higher general and administrative expense driven by non-recurring legal and regulatory matters.\" That included a $60 million refund settlement with the Federal Trade Commission over alleged deceptive practicesGross transaction value grew 14% from a year ago to $9.85 billion, surpassing a StreetAccount estimate of $9.54 billion. Instacart said this was its strongest quarter of growth for the metric in three years. Orders totaled 89.5 million orders, beating a StreetAccount estimate of 87.8 million. Finance chief Emily Reuter told CNBC that strong gains in Instacart's enterprise platform, where the company added 70 net new retailers last year, helped the company's robust gross transaction value.

Like many competitors, Instacart has toyed with new AI tools to optimize its platform for customers and businesses in an increasingly competitive food delivery market. Recent product launches include new AI tools for grocers and an integration with OpenAI's ChatGPT. Some experiments haven't gone so smoothly. In December, Instacart drew criticism over AI pricing tests it ran with a small group of retailers, which gave customers different prices on the same items. Instacart later halted the testing, saying it \"missed the mark.\"Food delivery apps like DoorDash and Uber Eats have also intensified their push into grocery delivery and added more retailers and AI features to their platforms. This week, Uber Eats debuted an AI tool to help customers build a grocery cart from text or images. Reuter said there are opportunities for multiple players to operate in what's becoming a \"huge\" market for consumers.\"We are the leader by far amongst digital first players, and that's because we have been able to execute across the promise of what most customers want consistently over time,\" she said.watch now",

    "body": "watch nowAmazon Web Services CEO Matt Garman suggested that investors might be worrying too much about the risk of artificial intelligence models slowing the growth of major software companies.\"Look, my own opinion is that much of the fear is overblown,\" Garman told CNBC's Jon Fortt on Thursday.Technology stocks have sold off this year following the release of software built on top of AI models from the likes of Anthropic and OpenAI. The iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF is down 24% so far in 2026, on par for the worst year since 2022, as inflation and rising interest rates drive companies to streamline post-pandemic technology spending. Analysts have taken to labeling the drawdown in software as a service stocks as an \"SaaS apocalypse.\" Software executives have responded by saying core business metrics have not deteriorated. The CEO of data analytics software company Databricks, Ali Ghodsi, said last week that he thought the correction is an overreaction. Last week, Amazon said revenue from its market-leading cloud infrastructure segment grew about 24% to $35.6 billion in the fourth quarter, a larger sum than analysts had expected. The unit showed a 35% operating margin, widening slightly from the previous quarter.Read more CNBC tech newsTech IPO hype gets drowned out on Wall Street by prospect of $1 trillion in debt salesFTC tells Tim Cook to look into reports Apple News is censoring conservativesAnthropic closes $30 billion funding round as cash keeps flowing into top AI startupsWaymo begins deploying next-gen Ojai robotaxis to extend its U.S. lead\"There's a huge disruption,\" Garman said. \"AI is absolutely a disruptive force that's going to change how software is consumed and how it's built. And I would argue that the systems of record, as you call them, the SaaS providers and the large players of today have an inside track to winning that business. Now, they have to innovate, just like the rest of the world. They can't stand still. If they stand still, they're absolutely going to be disrupted.\"AWS generates revenue from long-standing software companies such as Adobe, Intuit and Zillow, and it has picked up business from AI model developers. In November, the cloud announced a $38 billion spending commitment from OpenAI, which sells models for software developers in addition to ChatGPT subscriptions. \"Our perspective is that our customers are going to consume more compute technology and more infrastructure than they ever have, whether they run it themselves, whether they build it on top of AI, whether they buy it from SaaS vendors, whether they have some mix of that,\" Garman said.Large software companies have been releasing AI features, but their growth rates have not spiked. Two weeks ago, AWS customer ServiceNow reported that revenue increased 20.7% year over year in the fourth quarter, down from almost 26% two years earlier.Concerns about AI disruption have spread outside of technology software. Florida-based Algorhythm Holdings said on Thursday that an AI product is enabling logistics clients to quadruple freight volumes without raising headcount. C.H.

    "body": "watch nowSen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., on Thursday rejected a proposal aimed at ending the Department of Justice's controversial criminal probe into Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell and clearing a path for his successor, Kevin Warsh, to be confirmed.The proposed off-ramp, which has been floated by at least one Republican lawmaker this week, would see the Powell investigation handed off from the DOJ to the Senate Banking Committee. The idea is an attempt to thread a political needle: It would drop the threat of criminal prosecution against Powell – which spurred Tillis, a Banking Committee member, to declare a blockade on Warsh – while still satisfying President Donald Trump, who supports the DOJ probe.But Tillis poured cold water on that proposal Thursday morning.\"I'm not going to have an investigation out there,\" Tillis told reporters on Capitol Hill. \"We have to have an independent Fed. And we can't finesse this.\"Read more CNBC politics coverageEpstein files: DOJ says it logs Congress members' searches to 'protect' victim informationEpstein files: AG Pam Bondi seemed to have Rep.

    "body": "watch nowThe Department of Homeland Security is barreling toward a shutdown starting this weekend after Senate Democrats and the White House on Thursday failed to clinch a deal on immigration enforcement restrictions.A bill already approved by the House of Representatives, which would fund DHS through the end of the fiscal year on Sept. 30, failed on Thursday to clear a procedural hurdle in the Senate, meaning time will run out before a shutdown can be avoided.Sen. Chris Murphy, a Connecticut Democrat, shortly after that vote also objected to immediately considering what would have been the second two-week stopgap funding for DHS while negotiations continue.Congress went into a weeklong recess after Murphy's objection, making a shutdown set to begin at 12:01 a.m. ET Saturday.The looming shutdown comes as Democratic senators continue to negotiate directly with the White House and President Donald Trump on a deal that could unlock DHS funding. Democrats want new restrictions on immigration officers, citing the killing of two U.S. citizens in Minneapolis in January by federal agents who were there to conduct immigration enforcement.Read more CNBC politics coverageEpstein files: DOJ says it logs Congress members' searches to 'protect' victim informationEpstein files: AG Pam Bondi seemed to have Rep.

Mark Kelly over troops video, for nowWatch Pam Bondi hearing: AG touts record Dow as Democrats grill her over Trump, EpsteinThe rest of the federal government is funded through Sept. 30.The public is not likely to be significantly affected if DHS shuts down, because most of the department's employees would be deemed as essential workers, who would not be furloughed.However, many employees will be required to work without pay, especially if the shutdown drags on for a long time.The shutdown would hit employees at DHS subagencies, including the Transportation Security Administration, the Coast Guard and the Federal Emergency Management Agency. The TSA shutdown could affect travelers going through airport security, especially if agents miss their paychecks in early March.\"DHS essential missions and functions will continue as they do during every shutdown,\" a DHS spokesperson told CNBC. \"However, during a shutdown, many employees will be forced to work without pay, putting strain on the frontline defenders of our nation.\"So far, Democrats and the White House appear far apart on their terms for a deal to restore full funding to DHS.\"Today's strong vote was a shot across the bow to Republicans. Democrats will not support a blank check for chaos,\" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said at a press conference after Thursday's vote.Schumer threw cold water on the White House's latest offer. \"Their proposal is not serious,\" Schumer said. He declined to detail the sticking points. Democrats are pushing for a series of changes at DHS. They want a requirement for agents to wear body cameras, a bar on agents wearing masks and a requirement for judicial warrants for arrests. The Democrats also want an end to \"roving patrols,\" a term they have used to describe the administration's dragnet immigration operations. A senior White House official said the judicial warrants are a \"particularly challenging aspect,\" according to MS Now. The person, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the administration won't accept changes that affect its ability to deploy its immigration enforcement agenda.If a deal is reached, both chambers of Congress could come back from their recess and pass it. But it's far from clear that a deal will be clinched over the next week.And, many lawmakers are set to be in Germany then for the Munich Security Conference. \"If and when there's a breakthrough, we'll make sure people are here to vote on it,\" said Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D.",

The aircraft will be phased out starting in April, he said.Deal talks with investment firm Castlelake and fellow budget carrier Frontier Airlines haven't yielded an agreement that would give Spirit a path forward, though the airline could forge a plan on its own.Read more CNBC airline newsPressure mounts on American Airlines CEO as carrier lags rivalsBoeing outsold Airbus last year for first time since 2018, deliveries rise to 600Allegiant to buy rival budget airline Sun Country in $1.5 billion cash and stock dealWhy airline class wars will intensify in 2026The Dania Beach, Florida-based carrier is also calling 500 flight attendants back from furlough, just as it gears up for the spring break travel season.\"Fixing this airline is a shared effort,\" Bendoraitis said. \"There's a lot in this moment that crews can't control, but we do need you to continue giving us the foundation for a strong operation.\"Spirit has slashed its network and fleet and furloughed more than 1,300 flight attendants and hundreds of pilots to save cash.\"This is good news for 500 Flight Attendants and their families and critical to those of us on the line that have faced a grueling operation over the last two months,\" the Association of Flight Attendants-CWA, the union for Spirit flight attendants, said in a message to members Wednesday. \"The company's goal in recalling Flight Attendants is to ease some of the operational issues since the furloughs.\"",

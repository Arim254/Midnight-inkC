    "body": "Packages of Pampers diapers are displayed at a Target store on June 05, 2025 in Novato, California. Justin Sullivan | Getty ImagesProcter & Gamble is selling diapers made with silk fibers in China as part of the company's strategy to entice shoppers to spend more, even as demand for some of its products wanes.China is the company's second-largest market, trailing only the United States. In both markets, P&G has turned to innovation, rather than discounts, to attract consumers who are otherwise trying to spend less at the grocery store. For example, last year, it unveiled a new formula for its liquid Tide detergent in the U.S. In China, P&G also faces another challenge: a record-low birth rate. Government data released Monday showed that births dropped to 5.6 per 1,000 people in 2025, down from 6.4 in 2023. For P&G, fewer babies means the company is selling fewer diapers. To boost the sales of its baby-care division, P&G is leaning into luxury.Executives touted the success of the Pampers Prestige product on the company's earnings conference call Thursday. It added silk fibers to the inside of the diaper for skin comfort and protection.\"Chinese parents want only the best for their baby,\" P&G CEO Shailesh Jejurikar said.He added that \"reframing\" the company's super-premium diaper line has fueled double-digit organic sales growth and a 3% market share increase for P&G's baby-care business in Greater China over the last 18 months. The company did not share how the pricing of Pampers Prestige compares with its other diaper lines in China.In the latest quarter, P&G's overall baby-care division reported single-digit organic sales declines, despite a 20% jump in organic sales in Greater China, according to CFO Andre Schulten.More broadly, the focus on innovation is paying off for P&G. Consumer sentiment in China is still negative, yet P&G saw 3% growth in the market in the latest quarter, Schulten said on a call with reporters on Thursday.Stateside, P&G's sales were weaker. Organic sales in North America fell 2% in its fiscal second quarter. P&G is hoping that the strategy that is working in China could soon pay off in the U.S. The current bifurcated — or \"K-shaped\" — economy has showed that wealthier Americans are still willing to flex their purchasing power, even as lower-income shoppers pull back. Shares of P&G rose more than 2% in morning trading Thursday after the company reported better-than-expected earnings. However, P&G's revenue fell short of Wall Street's expectations, hurt by weaker demand in the U.S.",

    "body": "TikTok discussions overshadowed U.S.-China tariff negotiations during the latest round of talks.Anna Barclay | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesTikTok has just announced a new U.S. venture that will keep it operating there after years of concerns about its links to China. But even as it was nearly banned and faced scrutiny from officials, the short-video platform still dominated in 2025.The app, owned by Beijing-headquartered ByteDance, was the second-most-downloaded app across Apple's App Store and the Google Play Store in the U.S. in 2025, according to Sensor Tower data, defying a near-ban in the market.Another ByteDance app, CapCut, ranked fourth, with the video editing tool climbing three places from a year ago.Other China-linked apps also had strong showings across U.S. app stores in 2025, with major e-commerce players like Temu and Shein thriving even as they were targeted by policy changes, Sensor Tower data showed.Temu, which ran a high-profile Super Bowl ad campaign in 2024, fell from the top position that year, but still ranked in seventh place in 2025, even as U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs upended its business model.U.S. President Donald Trump speaks after signing an executive order on a deal that would divest TikTok's U.S. operations from ByteDance from its Chinese owner ByteDance, at the White House in Washington, D.C., U.S., Sept. 25, 2025.Kevin Lamarque | ReutersAlthough Shein did not rank among the top 10 most downloaded apps overall, it was the most downloaded app in the apparel shopping category in the U.S. in 2025.Separately, OpenAI's ChatGPT was America's most downloaded app last year, as adoption of generative artificial intelligence continued to expand.Sensor Tower's data shows that U.S. consumers continue to favor apps coming out of China, often synonymous with addictive algorithms, affordability, and convenience.\"2025 showed that these China-originated apps aren't just policy arbitrageurs, but are adaptive ecosystems with governance capabilities on both the demand and supply sides,\" Liang Chen, a Professor of Strategy & Entrepreneurship at Singapore Management University, told CNBC.Defying the banBefore Thursday's announcement of the U.S. joint venture, TikTok faced months of uncertainty in 2025. The Supreme Court upheld a law in January that effectively banned the video-sharing app from U.S. app stores unless ByteDance divested from the platform.The law, signed by President Joe Biden in April 2024, cited risks of the Chinese government accessing user data for surveillance or influence operations. Although TikTok briefly went dark in January, the law was never enforced. Upon taking office, Trump repeatedly extended the law's deadline as he negotiated a divestment deal.The threat of a TikTok ban also drew increased attention to Chinese alternatives such as Xiaohongshu, known in English as RedNote.Despite the uncertainty, not only did interest in TikTok's app hold steady, but it managed to expand its e-commerce business, TikTok Shop, which allows users to purchase products directly through videos and live streams. The company has said that, under the new joint venture plans, TikTok Global's U.S. entities will continue to manage certain commercial activities, including e-commerce and advertising. According to data from retail consulting firm Coresight, TikTok's U.S. revenues, including ad revenue, in-app purchases and commerce, rose 26.2% year over year to $13.9 billion, following 25.7% growth in 2024.\"TikTok's success in 2025 demonstrates a path to navigate geopolitical headwinds despite the continuously deteriorating U.S.-China relationship — a rare case of clever commercial strategy triumphing over politics,\" said Xiaomeng Lu, director of geo-technology at Eurasia Group. The app looks poised to close its deal with U.S. investors, with multiple Trump-Xi meetings planned throughout the year, she added. Temu, Shein and e-commerceTikTok Shop competitors Temu and Shein also remained major players in the U.S. last year despite new tariffs and increased government oversight of labor practices, supply chains, and product safety. The most significant of these headwinds was the Trump administration's closure of the \"de minimis\" trade loophole on May 2 and the imposition of broader tariffs on imports from China. The \"de minimis\" rule had allowed packages valued under $800 to enter the United States duty-free.Although Shein and Temu have moved their headquarters out of China in recent years, much of their operations and suppliers remain in the country.An employee packages garments for the online Chinese e-commerce company Temu at a clothing factory in Guangzhou, in southern China's Guangdong province on April 16, 2025. Jade Gao | Afp | Getty ImagesAnalysts said both companies adjusted to tariffs by negotiating lower supplier prices, absorbing some of the levy costs, and expanding supply networks beyond China, including in the United States.Coresight estimates Shein's U.S. revenue increased 16.8% year over year to $14.6 billion in 2025. Meanwhile, Temu's gross merchandise values increased by 21.8% year over year to $27.4 billion.\"[Policy] shocks in 2025 didn't really make demand disappear. Rather, they proved that these platforms can adapt their logistics, merchant mix, and incentive design faster than consumer habits shift,\" said Singapore Management University's Chen. Secret sauce Analysts said the staying power of apps such as TikTok, Temu and Shein stems from their attention-driven platforms and algorithms.\"The success of Temu, Shein, and TikTok Shop fundamentally reflects a shift in demand generation: moving away from legacy marketing tactics like simple ad-spend and display campaigns to a continuous, attention-economy strategy,\" said Scott Miller, CEO of e-commerce consulting firm pdPlus. \"Their growth shows that American consumers now discover products through highly engaging, viral, and personalized content, making demand creation a function of entertainment and constant digital presence rather than traditional top-down branding,\" he added. Those same algorithms and features have also drawn scrutiny from U.S. regulators. For example, officials have raised national security concerns over TikTok's recommendation algorithm, citing its potential for manipulation by the Chinese government. Regulators have also flagged data privacy and national security risks tied to Temu and Shein's data collection practices.Despite those concerns, the apps have continued to capture the attention of U.S. users and shoppers. \"American consumers overall don't really care an app's association with any specific country as long as they can find something they want at an affordable price,\" said Yao Jin, an associate professor of supply chain management at Miami University.\"[That] is exactly the competitive advantage of most China-originated apps.\"",

    "body": "A guide sign reading \"Bank of Japan\" is seen in Tokyo on July 31, 2024.Kazuhiro Nogi | Afp | Getty ImagesJapan's central bank on Friday raised economic growth forecasts while holding its key policy rate at 0.75% as the country prepares to go into an election.  The Bank of Japan upgraded its economic growth forecast for the fiscal year ending in March 2026 to 0.9% from 0.7% in October 2025, and also raised its GDP expansion outlook for the 2026 fiscal year to 1% from 0.7%. The central bank expects Japan's GDP to grow moderately as other countries return to growth, and the BOJ sees a virtuous cycle of rising prices and wages, supported by government's economic measures and accommodative financial conditions.The central bank kept the benchmark interest rate steady in a split 8-1 decision, after raising it to the highest level in 30 years in December, ahead of snap polls that could see Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi sharpen her advocacy for monetary easing and fiscal support.In its statement, the BOJ revealed that board member Hajime Takata had proposed raising rates to 1%, saying that risks to prices in Japan were skewed to the upside. The bank, which forecast inflation to fall below the 2% target in the first half of the year, expects underlying inflation to \"continue rising moderately.\"Underlying inflation is still supported by wage growth and sticky prices of services that continue to run above 2%, according to Masahiko Loo, senior fixed income strategist at State Street Investment Management. \"This firm underlying inflation reinforces our view that the BOJ's normalization path will stay intact, albeit at a gradual pace,\" he said. Japan's December inflation data, released earlier in the day, showed headline price growth coming in at 2.1%, its lowest since March 2022, but still running above the BOJ's target of 2% for a 45th straight month. So called \"core-core\" inflation, which strips out fresh food and energy prices, came in at 2.9% in December.Japan embarked on the path to policy normalization in March 2024, abandoning the world's last negative interest rate regime, and has stressed on raising rates subject to a virtuous cycle of growth in wages and prices.That policy, however, has come under political pressure with prominent names including Takaichi advocating for softer rates to fuel economic growth. Japan's economy shrank more than initially estimated in the third quarter, contracting 0.6% quarter on quarter, and 2.3% on an annualized basis.BOJ Governor Kazuo Ueda said Friday that the bank will continue to raise interest rates if its economic and price forecasts materialize, according to a Reuters translation of his remarks. Bond and yen worries Despite BOJ's monetary tightening, Japanese bond yields have been rising, hitting multidecade highs over the past month, driving capital outflows and weakening the yen. This comes as real rates still remain negative, according to the BOJ, as well as mounting fiscal worries.  Ueda said the rise of long-term interest rates were going at a \"fast pace,\" but that the BOJ was ready to take \"nimble action to cope with exceptional moves.\"Takaichi had planned a record $783 billion budget for the next fiscal year, starting April 1, on top of a $135 billion stimulus package last year targeted at helping households with the rising cost of living. Pressured by rising yields amid fiscal concerns, the yen has seen a significant decline against the dollar toward the end of last year, falling about 4.6% since Oct. 21, when Takaichi became prime minister to its current level of 158.97.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconThis weakness prompted Finance Minister Satsuki Katayama to warn against \"one-sided\" moves in the currency. Katayama reportedly told reporters in Washington last week that she has conveyed her \"deep concern\" over the depreciation in yen and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent shared her view on \"one-sided\" weakness in the Japanese currency. On Friday, she reportedly said that the bond market rout has appeared to have receded, and that she was closely monitoring financial markets with a \"high sense of urgency.\"When asked if he agreed with Katayama, Ueda said that \"volatility remains high\" and that he would \"scrutinise developments carefully.\"State Street's Loo said that his base case for the BOJ is one hike in 2026 and another in 2027 with a terminal rate of 1.25%. If the yen breaches the 160 level against the dollar, there could be two hikes this year and one as early as April, bringing the terminal rate to 1.5%. A terminal rate, also known as the neutral rate, is one that one that balances inflation and economic growth. Separately, Takaichi on Friday dissolved Japan's Lower House, with the country set to go to polls in a snap election on Feb. 8. ",

    "body": "An employee at the Celsior Wadamachi supermarket in Yokohama, Japan, on Thursday, Jan. 15, 2026. Soaring food costs are a key component driving broader inflation higher, with data Friday expected to show consumer price growth has stayed above the central bank's 2% target for four straight calendar years. Bloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesJapan's headline inflation rate slowed sharply to 2.1%, its lowest level since March 2022, down from 2.9% in November, as easing price pressures collide with political focus on living costs and a looming central bank decision.This was the 45th straight month that the inflation figure has been above the Bank of Japan's 2% target. Core inflation, which strips out prices of fresh food, stood at 2.4%, in line with analysts' estimates and its lowest level since October 2024. That was sharply lower than November's 3%.The so-called \"core-core\" inflation rate — which strips out prices for fresh food and energy — eased to 2.9% from 3% a month earlier.Japan's full-year inflation stood at 3.2%, according to government data. Inflation hit a two-year high in January 2025, before tapering down over the course of the year.However, Japan saw rice inflation hit its highest in over 50 years in May, and rice prices soared to record highs then. Rice inflation for December came in at 34.4%, marking the seventh straight month of decline from a year ago. Despite that, rice prices in Japan remain near record levels. Data from Japan's agriculture ministry showed the average price of a 5-kilogram bag of rice was at 4,267 yen for the week ended Jan. 11. Back in 2025, soaring rice prices and careless comments cost then farm minister Taku Eto his job and reportedly prompted former prime minister Shigeru Ishiba to take personal responsibility for lowering prices as a rice shortage took hold. \"Goods inflation in Japan is still the main driver of inflation,\" Marcel Theliant, Head of Asia Pacific at Capital Economics, told CNBC's \"Squawk Box Asia\" on Friday. He noted that in 2025, import prices slowed as the yen strengthened, but they have since stopped falling. \"So it's possible [that] goods inflation probably remains higher for longer, and that will keep inflation above the BOJ's target for longer.\"This would possibly prompt an interest rate hike as soon as April, Theliant said.Snap electionThe data comes as Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi dissolved Japan's Lower House on Friday ahead of a snap election scheduled for Feb. 8.Takaichi has made tackling the cost of living a priority and has vowed to suspend Japan's 8% food tax for 2 years to help households with rising living costs.Last year, her government put together a massive $135 billion stimulus package for the country, which included measures to expand local government grants, as well as provide subsidies for electricity and gas bills.Separately, the Bank of Japan slightly raised its inflation forecast for the 2026 fiscal year to 1.9% from 1.8% and held its policy rate at 0.75%.— CNBC's Martin Soong, Chery Kang and Kaori Enjoji contributed to this report.

Amarjeet Kumar Singh | Anadolu | Getty ImagesIndia's largest airline, Indigo, that cancelled more than 2,500 flights within days last month causing massive disruptions, reported a 78% drop in profit in the December quarter, sending its shares down more than 3%.The company, which reported results after market close on Thursday, made a provision of 5.8 billion rupees ($63 million) toward compensation following flight disruptions in December. The larger impact on its earnings, however, was from a one-time charge owed to the implementation of new labor code and forex losses, together amounting to about 20 billion rupees. The lack of progress on the U.S.-India trade deal has hurt investor confidence, contributing to capital outflows, and has weighed on the rupee, making it Asia's worst performing currency last year — down about 5%. The currency was last trading at 91.52 and experts predict it to slip further to 92 rupee per dollar level by end of March, which could spell more trouble for forex-exposed businesses including Indigo.The March quarter for the airline is \"expected to be weaker\" despite a 10% rise in available seat kilometers, or ASK, according to a report by Jefferies on Thursday. ASK is a key metric for measuring passenger capacity.The brokerage added that the airline will see a \"moderation\" in passenger revenue per available seat kilometer (PRASK) and increase in cost per available seat kilometer as the company \"continues to add aircraft.\"Jefferies maintains a buy rating on the stock with a target price of 6,140 rupees per share.Airlines in India face pressure on both costs and revenue fronts as a majority of the airlines get nearly 65% of their revenue from domestic travel, for which passengers pay in Indian rupees, but most of the costs are in dollars.Indigo is adding more capacity because they need to grow, but the next 6-12 months will be tough, as we expect the rupee to weaken further and fuel costs to rise, said Mark Martin, founder and CEO of aviation consulting firm Martin Consulting.He told CNBC that Indigo may need to fly on more international routes to improve its dollar earnings. This was also hinted at in the company's earnings call, with the management saying that new seat additions will be skewed toward international routes.Labor painsLabor reforms in India, which have expanded the scope and eligibility of social security benefits for employees, also weighed on Indigo's earnings as it recognized one-time charges of 9.7 billion rupees. Several large Indian companies, such as Tata Consultancy Services and ICICI Bank, have reported a one-time hit on earnings due to the labor reforms during the December quarter. In November, the Indian government announced reforms, consolidating 29 separate labor laws into four comprehensive codes, walking a tightrope between balancing business interests and employee welfare.Under these codes, fixed term or contract employees will now qualify for benefits available to permanent workers, including leave, medical, and social security.However, this was not the only change in government regulation that impacted Indigo during the last quarter.In November last year, government implemented flight duty time limitation norms under which airlines were mandated to operate fewer late-night flights and rest time for crew was increased from 36 hours to 48 hours.In the first week of December, Indigo cancelled thousands of flights, blaming it on the changes to the pilot rest policy. Early December was the \"the most challenging weeks\" in Indigo's history, said Pieter Elbers, chief executive of the Indigo.Last week, India's Directorate General of Civil Aviation ordered the airline to pay a penalty of 222 million rupees in connection with the operational disruptions, which is part of the one-time provisions. Currently, Indigo is operating 2,100-2,200 daily flights, said Elbers, who had come under fire following the disruption in December, adding that the airline will be able to comply with the government's flight duty time limitation norms by February.Indigo served 124 million customers in 2025, up 9% on year, according to its statement.

    "body": "DAVOS, SWITZERLAND - JANUARY 20: Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney delivers a speech at the World Economic Forum Annual Meeting held in Davos, Switzerland on January 20, 2026.Anadolu | Getty ImagesU.S. President Donald Trump withdrew the invitation to Canada to join his \"Board of Peace,\" days after Prime Minister Mark Carney's address in Davos warning against economic coersion by the world's superpowers.   \"Dear Prime Minister Carney: Please let this Letter serve to represent that the Board of Peace is withdrawing its invitation to you regarding Canada's joining,\" Trump said in a post on Truth Social on Thursday night stateside. Carney said last week that he intended to join the board but details, including financial terms, had yet to be worked out. States looking for a permanent seat need to pay $1 billion.In his speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, earlier this week, Carney said the world's \"middle powers\" must band together to resist coercion from the world's largest powers. \"Great powers have begun using economic integration as weapons. Tariffs as leverage, financial infrastructure as coercion, supply chains as vulnerabilities to be exploited,\" he said. While Carney did not name any country, Trump responded later, saying on the sidelines of the forum that \"Canada lives because of the United States. Remember that, Mark, the next time you make your statements.\" Hours before Carney's speech, Trump had posted on social media a digitally-altered image of a map with Greenland, Venezuela and Canada covered with American flag.  Recent events have shown that \"the rules-based international order\" is effectively dead, while the world's superpowers \"pursue their interests using economic integration as a weapon of coercion,\" Carney said in his speech.  Relations between the two longstanding allies have come under heavy strain in Trump's second term, who has referred to the neighboring country as the U.S.' 51st state, besides targeting it with tariffs. U.S. President Donald Trump (R) meets with Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney in the Oval Office of the White House on October 07, 2025 in Washington, DC. Anna Moneymaker | Getty ImagesThe \"Board of Peace,\" chaired by Trump, was originally conceived to oversee the demilitarization and rebuilding of Gaza strip after a two-year war with Israel. But Trump said he foresees the board to take a wider role that could ultimately rival the United Nations, a remit that has alarmed several U.S. allies. Trump has garnered the support from regional Middle East countries including Turkey, Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Qatar, as well as emerging economies such as Indonesia. But several global powers and traditional Western U.S. allies have been more cautious, including Australia, France, Germany, Italy and some have rejected the proposal. U.K. Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper reportedly said that it \"won't be one of the signatories\" citing concerns over Russian President Vladimir Putin's invitation to join.  Russia and China are among those invited to join the board. Putin reportedly told the Russian security council that the foreign ministry was still studying the proposal while China has not confirmed whether it will join. Carney's WEF address followed his high-profile visit to China last week, where he reached a wide-ranging agreement with President Xi Jinping to reduce tariffs and rebuild ties. As part of the deal, Beijing cut tariffs on a number of agricultural products from Canada while Ottawa increased the quotas for imports of Chinese electric vehicles into its market with the most-favored-nation tariff rate of 6.1%. Carney hailed his strategic partnership with Xi, touting the importance of their ties in the face of a \"new world order,\" in a veiled reference to the global instability caused by Trump's foreign policy swings and disruptive trade agenda.

Indian billionaire Gautam Adani, chair of India's Adani Group and one of the world's richest people, was indicted with seven other men in New York federal court in November 2024 on charges related to a massive bribery and fraud scheme.The SEC has approached a U.S. District Judge, Nicholas Garaufis in Brooklyn, seeking permission to issue a legal summons to Adani Group Chairman Gautam Adani and the executive director of Adani Green Energy, Sagar Adani, according to court filings. CNBC has reached out to Adani Group and the U.S. SEC for comment.Shares of Adani Green Energy ended the session nearly 14% lower, while those of the flagship company Adani Enterprises closed 10.7% lower on Friday. Shares of Adani Power dropped 5.7%.The Adani Group executives are charged with misleading U.S. and international investors about their company's compliance with anti-bribery and anti-corruption practices, as they raised more than $3 billion in capital to fund those energy contracts.India's Ministry of Law and Justice has twice refused last year to deliver the summons to Gautam Adani and Sagar Adani under the Hague Convention, the SEC told the court. \"The Ministry appeared to suggest that the SEC lacks authority to invoke the Hague Convention or seek service of the Summonses,\" it said.Adani and several other defendants are accused of having paid Indian government officials more than $250 million in bribes to obtain solar energy supply contracts worth more than $2 billion in profits.",

Shares traded 30% higher at 32.5 euros ($38.2) at 12:21 p.m. London time (7:21 a.m. ET), having jumped as much as 32% earlier in the session. The upswing implies a market capitalization of roughly 32.5 billion euros. The Prague-based company, which makes armed vehicles, ammunition, and advanced defense systems, raised a total of 3.8 billion euros in its initial public offering. Euronext said the listing marked the world's largest defense IPO ever recorded, both in terms of amount raised and market capitalization.\"Today marks a historic milestone for CSG as we join the Euronext Amsterdam market and we welcome the confidence shown in us by investors,\" Michal Strnad, chairman of CSG, said in a statement.\"Becoming a publicly listed company demonstrates our commitment to high standards of transparency, disclosure and corporate governance and strengthens our ability to invest in innovation, expand our global reach and deliver on our mission to be a critical long-term supplier of advanced defence and industrial solutions to NATO states and Government partners worldwide,\" he added.The listing comes after weeks of mounting geopolitical tensions, with U.S. President Donald Trump threatening to use military force to seize Greenland from Denmark, a NATO ally. In a surprise development on Wednesday, however, Trump said he had agreed to a framework of a future deal with respect to the self-governing Danish territory. In Europe, meanwhile, investors have continued to pile into defense stocks, fueled by a mix of European Union, national and private capital funding.Strategists have cited Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine and the end of the U.S. defense umbrella in Europe as underpinning a so-called \"mega-trend in the making.\"  — CNBC's Hugh Leask contributed to this report.",

Fabrice Coffrini | Afp | Getty ImagesBEIJING — Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang plans to visit China in the coming days ahead of the mid-February Lunar New Year, two people familiar with the matter told CNBC. The trip comes as questions persist over the U.S. chip giant's ability to sell in the Chinese market, which once accounted for at least one-fifth of revenue from Nvidia's data center business.U.S. export restrictions have prevented Nvidia from selling its most advanced chips to China as Washington seeks to maintain an edge over Beijing in chips used to develop cutting-edge artificial intelligence.Huang is expected to attend an Nvidia company party in Beijing on Monday, said one of the sources, who requested anonymity to speak about the trip.He is also set to meet with potential buyers in China and discuss recent logistical challenges in supplying U.S.-approved Nvidia chips into the market, according to a person with direct knowledge of the travel plans. The Information reported last week, citing sources, that China would only approve local purchases of Nvidia's H200 AI chips for limited purposes such as research. When asked about the report Thursday, China's Commerce Ministry claimed it was unaware of the situation. Bloomberg first reported news of Huang's China trip earlier this week. Nvidia declined to comment on executive travel plans. Huang visited mainland China at least three times last year, including in January for Lunar New Year celebrations. \n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tWeekly analysis and insights from Asia's largest economy in your inbox\n\t\t\tSubscribe now\n\t\t\n\t",

Kent Nishimura | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesThe House of Representatives on Thursday passed the final set of outstanding government funding bills as a partial federal government shutdown looms on Jan. 30.The four bills account for the largest chunk of government spending, about $1.2 trillion in total. They would fund the departments of Defense; Health and Human Services; Homeland Security; Labor; Housing and Urban Development; Transportation; and Education. The Homeland Security bill passed 220-207, while the other three cleared 341-88 as part of a package known as a \"minibus.\"The bills represent the final quartet of 12 annual appropriations bills required to fund the government and avoid a partial shutdown on Jan. 30. The Senate still needs to approve them, along with two other House-passed funding bills, before they head to President Donald Trump's desk for a signature. The Senate does not return until next week, and a winter storm closing in on Washington over the weekend threatens to complicate those plans. House lawmakers were widely expected to pass the bills on Thursday, with lawmakers desperate to avoid another shutdown after enduring a record 43-day shutdown last year. Despite bipartisan accord on avoiding another shutdown, some of the bills still face serious hurdles in the Senate.

    "body": "A pharmacist displays a box of Wegovy pills at a pharmacy in Provo, Utah, Jan. 15, 2026.George Frey | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesThe future of the booming obesity drug market won't hinge on drugs that deliver greater weight loss alone. Top executives from drugmakers big and small told CNBC that the next phase of the space will be defined by a broader range of treatment options and improved access for patients. Those were among the themes that emerged at the annual JPMorgan Healthcare Conference in San Francisco during interviews with top brass from Eli Lilly, Novo Nordisk, Pfizer and other drugmakers. \"We really see the obesity market going from, in this year, a one-size-fits-all kind of idea to different medicines for different patients. We don't have a crystal ball to know how that all sorts out,\" Dan Skovronsky, Eli Lilly's chief scientific officer, told CNBC in an interview at the conference.\"But I think by presenting people with options, they'll pick for themselves with their doctors, and I think we want to have something for everyone,\" he continued. \"And we're not done yet.\" Over the coming years, executives expect an expanding menu of obesity treatments that can be tailored to an individual patient's needs — from pills and less-frequent injections to combination regimens and drugs designed to preserve muscle mass while promoting weight loss. Some also expect the direct-to-consumer market to become an even larger slice of the market, while hoping that hurdles preventing patients from getting treatment continue to fall.Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly are widely credited with establishing the market through their weekly GLP-1 injections for obesity and diabetes, which have surged in popularity in recent years. The next chapter is already taking shape, with Novo launching the first GLP-1 pill for obesity earlier this month and Lilly preparing to bring an oral option of its own to market later this year. While those companies will play a critical role in how the space evolves, other players from pharma titan Pfizer to little-known upstarts could also enter the market — both threatening the two rivals' sales dominance and offering more treatment alternatives for consumers.While access remains a challenge for many patients, the ability to get GLP-1s has improved notably over the past year. Both Novo and Lilly have slashed cash prices for their injections and struck deals with President Donald Trump in November that will, for the first time, introduce Medicare coverage for obesity drugs later this year.More treatment options and wider access could boost the case for analyst projections that say the weight loss and diabetes drug market could be worth almost $100 billion annually by the end of the decade. In an interview at the conference, Novo Nordisk CEO Mike Doustdar said the company and Lilly currently have around 15 million people combined who have obesity taking GLP-1s. There is still a \"long tail\" to reaching the 110 million that are reportedly suffering from the condition, along with those who are overweight, he added. In a May report, McKinsey said it expects a range of 25 to 50 million U.S. patients to use GLP-1s by 2030. Here's what executives say the future of the space could look like. The pill potentialPills have not yet proven more effective than injections. Still, the consensus among executives is that oral options could expand the market, reaching entirely new patients. That may include people who are afraid of needles, as well as people who could benefit from existing injections but don't view their condition as severe enough to warrant a weekly shot.In an interview at the conference, Doustdar said it could also include people who travel frequently and can't easily refrigerate injections. \"There is so much aligned exactly with this market expansion story … because there is a huge number of patients that are simply not interested in losing weight at the cost of injecting themselves,\" Doustdar said. The \"real growth\" and uptake of the pills is going to come from primary care physicians, who write the majority of prescriptions for Americans and typically prefer pills to injections, said Ray Stevens, the CEO of obesity market hopeful Structure Therapeutics. He said he believes his company's GLP-1 pill, aleniglipron, will be the third to enter the market after Eli Lilly's and Novo Nordisk's. Structure's oral drug will enter Phase 3 trials this year. Daily pills can offer more flexibility to patients. For example, Stevens said a patient could cut a pill in half to mitigate side effects on a day when they have an important meeting to attend. Lilly's Skovronsky said pills will also serve as a way for patients to \"deescalate their therapy\" after taking injections. The company in December released data showing that patients who initially took Wegovy or Zepbound shots maintained the majority of their weight loss after switching to Lilly's pill. \"They say, 'I've lost the weight, I've got this, so I can maintain this on my own with something less strong,'\" Skovronsky said. Structure is also developing an oral drugs that targets amylin, an emerging form of weight loss treatment that mimics a hormone co-secreted with insulin in the pancreas to suppress appetite and reduce food intake. Novo is developing a medicine called amycretin, which targets both GLP-1 and amylin to offer potentially enhanced weight loss. Mixing and matching drugsStevens said combination regimens are \"going to be the next phase of the field.\" For example, Structure hopes to combine its oral GLP-1 and amylin drugs to achieve even greater weight loss than one alone would, which he said will likely be \"one of the best combos of the future.\" It's too early to say which patients would be the best fit for that regimen, but Stevens said it could achieve \"good tolerability, really good patient experience and good efficacy.\" He said the company is already working on manufacturing the two ingredients together in a single pill, which is similar to what Novo's amycretin achieves. But he said combination regimens can also help treat certain obesity-related conditions better than one product alone. That could look like combining a GLP-1 with one of the existing treatments for fatty liver disease. \"I feel like the winners are now starting to emerge for the monotherapy\" treatments, he said. But Stevens said the treatment patients take will segment according to the other health conditions a person has on top of obesity, such as fatty liver disease, chronic kidney disease and cardiovascular disease. Lilly's upcoming pill is an oral GLP-1, but Skovronsky said the company can see the potential for a pill that targets that hormone along with another called GIP, since that's a \"preferred formulation.\" That's how tirzepatide, the active ingredient in Lilly's blockbuster obesity and diabetes injections, works. That drug has proven to be more effective than semaglutide, the active ingredient in Novo Nordisk's rival injections, which only targets GLP-1. Skovronsky said, \"we're working hard to create those medicines\" in an oral form, but aren't ready to disclose any details. Pfizer inherited several experimental injections and pills with combination potential from its roughly $10 billion acquisition of the obesity biotech Metsera last year. But Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla said the company is also developing an in-house oral drug that blocks the GIP receptor, which can significantly reduce side effects when combined with GLP-1. \"I have very high hopes that it will also differentiate,\" Bourla said.One biotech, Wave Life Sciences, also sees combinations as part of its broader strategy, its CEO Paul Bolno said in an interview at the conference. Different weight loss methodsWave is taking a different approach to weight loss, targeting how the body burns fat rather than suppressing appetite. The goal is to achieve comparable weight loss to GLP-1s, without the associated muscle loss, and with less frequent dosing of once or twice a year rather than weekly. That push comes amid growing focus on the quality of weight loss with next-generation obesity drugs, as GLP-1 treatments have raised concerns around muscle loss, side effects and patient drop-offs.Wave has an experimental injection that uses RNA technology to lower levels of a protein called activin E – a liver-produced protein that slows fat burning. By reducing that protein, Wave believes the drug can increase fat loss, particularly harmful visceral fat, while preserving lean muscle mass. Bolno said the company is developing the injection, called WVE-007, as a monotherapy or a potential maintenance treatment that patients can switch to and take far less frequently after being on GLP-1s.But he also sees the opportunity to combine the company's injection with GLP-1s to \"continue to drive benefits.\" \"We can double the weight loss on GLP-1s in combination,\" Bolno said, referring to what the company is seeing in preclinical research. He said adding Wave's injection on top of a GLP-1 won't make it more difficult for patients to tolerate the treatment regimen, so it makes the company's drug \"very amenable to combination\" options.As for who can use Wave's injection, Bolno said it will work for any patient since \"this happens to be a target that's actually in human genetics.\"The future of the industry will likely also include drugs that can achieve even greater weight loss than the current treatments on the market. Lilly in December released the first late-stage data on an injectable drug called retatrutide, the highest dose of which achieved more than 28% weight loss at 68 weeks among patients who stayed on the treatment. Lilly will read out data on seven other Phase 3 trials on the drug this year. Dubbed the \"triple G\" drug, retatrutide works by mimicking three hunger-regulating hormones — GLP-1, GIP and glucagon — rather than just one or two. That appears to have more potent effects on a person's appetite and satisfaction with food than other treatments. Skovronsky said the drug could serve patients who need additional weight loss or have other severe health conditions on top of obesity, such as arthritis knee pain. Novo Nordisk is racing to catch up: In March, it agreed to pay up to $2 billion for the rights to an early experimental drug from Chinese drugmaker United Laboratories International. The newly acquired treatment is a clear potential competitor to retatrutide because it similarly uses a three-pronged approach to promoting weight loss and regulating blood sugar.Patient access to drugsThe industry has made strides toward improving drug access for patients, and executives expect that will continue. The cash price of Novo's pill is already the lowest seen on the market, at $149 for the starting dose and up to $299 for the higher doses. GLP-1 injections are roughly $1,000 per month before insurance and without recent cash discounts.Both Pfizer's Bourla and Lilly's Skovronsky said upcoming Medicare coverage of obesity drugs should also move the needle with coverage. \"Once the government starts covering it in Medicare, it probably will become more and more uncomfortable for employers to not — it's that societal pressure,\" Skovronsky said. He also pointed to an \"activation of consumers,\" where patients are starting to call their employers and ask why their benefits don't cover obesity drugs. Drugmakers, researchers and scientists are also generating more data about the benefits of obesity drugs for health-care spending, which could help spur more employer coverage, Skovronsky said. \"So for employers, is there less absenteeism? Is there better productivity? Is there better medical costs?\" he said. \"The data's coming in, and we're seeing more and more of that.\" In terms of the direct-to-consumer channel, Skovronsky said it may become the \"fastest-growing segment\" of the space given the recent push for drugmakers to launch cash offerings. Lilly was among the first companies to launch a direct-to-consumer platform in 2024 offering its obesity drug Zepbound at a discount, and Novo followed more than a year later. Bourla estimated that the direct-to-consumer channel already makes up 30% of the obesity and diabetes drug market in the U.S. It could become closer to 90% or more of that market abroad, he added. When asked about what the broader market will look like by 2030, Structure's Stevens said he hopes access and affordability are no longer issues.\"I'm okay with the cost dropping because, to me, this has always been about volume and really trying to address a very large unmet need globally itself,\" he said.",

    "body": "Greenland’s Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen holds a press conference in Nuuk, Greenland, Jan. 22, 2026. Marko Djurica | ReutersGreenland Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen said in a press conference Thursday that he doesn't know what's in the \"framework\" deal that President Donald Trump announced after meeting with NATO's leader a day earlier.But Nielsen emphasized that no deal involving Greenland can be struck without the island and its governing kingdom, Denmark, having a say.Any such deal must respect Greenland's \"red lines\" — including its sovereignty and territorial integrity, he added.\"We choose the Kingdom of Denmark. We choose the EU. We choose NATO,\" Nielsen told the press in Nuuk, Greenland. \"This is not only a situation for Greenland and the Kingdom of Denmark, it's about the world order for all of us.\"The remarks echoed Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen's earlier statement maintaining that Greenland's sovereignty is non-negotiable.Nielsen's comments came one day after Trump — who has spent weeks aggressively pressuring Europe over a proposed U.S. takeover of Greenland — abruptly announced that he and NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte have forged the \"framework of a future deal.\"The announcement, delivered in a Truth Social post following a closed-door meeting in Davos, Switzerland, was light on details. In a CNBC interview, Trump called it the \"concept of a deal\" and said he would \"explain it down the line.\"Read more CNBC politics coverageGreenland PM: Trump-NATO deal framework unclear, sovereignty is a red lineTrump sues Jamie Dimon, JPMorgan Chase over debanking the suit calls 'political'Trump says he reached Greenland deal 'framework' with NATO, backs off tariffsTrump interview live updates: CNBC's Joe Kernen sits down with the president at DavosRussia watches as ally Iran edges closer to collapse. Here's why it matters for MoscowTrump's latest geopolitical gambits all lead back to ChinaTrump says anything less than U.S. control of Greenland is 'unacceptable' ahead of talksBut the agreement was apparently enough for Trump to cancel the forthcoming tariffs he had imposed on eight European countries that had come to Greenland's defense amid the president's saber-rattling.Trump suggested to CNBC that the framework involves mineral rights for the U.S., as well as the Trump administration's proposed \"Golden Dome\" missile defense system.Meanwhile, The New York Times reported Wednesday that some NATO officials had separately discussed a possible compromise in which the U.S. would get sovereignty over \"small pockets of Greenland for military bases.\"Nielsen on Thursday rejected that proposal out of hand, while repeatedly noting that he has not been told what the Trump-Rutte framework entails.\"I don't know what's concrete in that deal,\" he said. \"But I know that we have now a high-level working group working on a solution for both parties.\"\"We have some red lines\" that cannot be crossed, Nielsen said. \"We have to respect our territorial integrity. We have to respect international law, sovereignty.\"\"Our integrity and our borders and international law is definitely, definitely a red line that we don't want anyone to cross,\" he added later in the presser. \"And I don't think that is strange at all.\"Nielsen said that he believes those red lines, which were recently relayed to Rutte from Danish and Greenlandic officials, have since \"been delivered\" to Trump.But there's been \"nothing about a deal on mineral resources or anything else,\" he said. Greenland is willing to negotiate with the U.S. on economics and other matters, \"but that's something we have to talk about in mutual respect,\" he added.Nielsen also directly criticized the Trump administration's aggression toward Greenland, including the recent flare-up in tensions that, until Wednesday, included the possibility of U.S. military action.\"No doubt, the rhetoric we have heard the last year is unacceptable for us,\" he said, adding that it is difficult to maintain a respectful dialogue when Greenland's citizens \"every night hear threats about acquiring and taking.\"\"Try to imagine how it is as Greenlanders, as people here, peaceful people in Greenland, hear and see in the media every day that somebody wants to take your freedom.\"",

    "body": "Xiaomi logo at an exhibition in Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province, China on November 1, 2025. Cfoto | Future Publishing | Getty ImagesChinese tech giant Xiaomi saw its shares pop over 2% in trading on Friday after it announced a stock buyback program worth up to HK$2.5 billion ($321 million). The repurchase plan comes as the electric vehicle and smartphone maker looks to reassure investors amid intensifying competition, rising component costs and recent product safety concerns. Despite Friday's gains, Xiaomi's shares are down over 8% so far this year, reflecting sustained pressure on its valuation.The company has regularly repurchased shares in recent years, including 4 million shares for HK$152 million on Jan. 13.Critics of stock buybacks argue that the practice can boost share prices without improving a company's underlying business. They say buybacks divert cash from other investments, such as employee pay, factory expansion, job creation and innovation.Xiaomi's latest buyback begins Jan. 23 and will be executed on the open market, subject to market conditions and regulatory approvals, according to a filing with the Hong Kong Stock Exchange late Thursday. Stock Chart IconStock chart iconThe Beijing-based firm is one of China's largest consumer technology companies, with businesses in smartphones, electric vehicles and smart home devices. Analysts say the stock has faced pressure recently as a looming memory chip shortage threatens to push up component costs for its consumer devices, particularly smartphones. \"[The shortage] has caused margin compression for smartphone manufacturers and a number of independent industry forecasters have lowered their outlook for smartphones,\" said Dan Baker, senior equity analyst at Morningstar.The memory shortage is only expected to worsen this year, as manufacturers continue to focus on the growing memory demands of the AI industry, diverting capacity from electronics manufacturers.\"2026 is going to be challenging not just for Xiaomi but for many Chinese [Original Equipment Manufacturers] as domestic Android players remain most vulnerable to chip shortages,\" said Ivan Lam, senior analyst at Counterpoint Research. Last year, Xiaomi's shares had also faced pressure following reports of accidents involving its vehicles that went viral on social media. More broadly, the company has been affected by an ongoing price war in China's EV market, which has weighed on margins across the sector. Regarding its EV business, Kyna Wong, a China technology analyst at Citi Research, said that investors had also been disappointed by Xiaomi's modest 550,000-unit vehicle delivery target for 2026. She added that margins on the company's vehicle sales are likely to trend down due to changes to Beijing's EV subsidy policies in 2026. Meanwhile, Xiaomi has been investing heavily in longer-term initiatives, including an internal semiconductor division. Last year, the company committed at least 50 billion yuan over the next 10 years, starting in 2025, to develop its own chips.Xiaomi also plans to expand its electric vehicles business globally over the next few years, following the launch of its premium SU7 Ultra. watch now",

    "body": "watch nowJPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon said Wednesday that he disagreed with President Donald Trump's approach to immigration, offering a rare public rebuke by a U.S. corporate leader of one of Trump's signature policies. Dimon, speaking on a panel at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, initially praised Trump's moves to secure the borders of the world's largest economy. Illegal crossings at the U.S.-Mexico border fell to the lowest level in 50 years for the period from October 2024 to September 2025, the BBC reported citing federal data.But Dimon, who has long advocated for immigration reform to boost U.S. economic growth, also made an apparent reference to videos of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers rounding up people alleged to be undocumented immigrants.\"I don't like what I'm seeing, with five grown men beating up little women,\" Dimon said. \"So I think we should calm down a little bit on the internal anger about immigration.\"It's unclear if Dimon was speaking about a specific incident, or more broadly about ICE confrontations.In the first year of his second term, Trump has overhauled U.S. immigration policy with a focus on mass deportations, tightened asylum access and ramped-up spending for ICE personnel and facilities. Among a torrent of new policies that changed the landscape for seeking American citizenship, the administration also rescinded guidance on where ICE arrests could happen, leading to raids at schools, hospitals and places of worship.Unlike during Trump's first term, American CEOs have mostly avoided public criticism of his policies. Wall Street analysts have speculated that business leaders fear retribution from the Trump administration, which has sued media companies, universities and law firms, and instead choose to appeal to the president out of the public spotlight.On Wednesday, Dimon said that he wanted to know more about who is being swept up in ICE raids: \"Are they here legally? Are they criminals? ... Did they break American law?\"\"We need these people,\" Dimon added. \"They work in our hospitals and hotels and restaurants and agriculture, and they're good people .… They should be treated that way.\"'A climate of fear'For years, in annual shareholder letters and media interviews, Dimon has cited an immigration overhaul as one of the main avenues to unlock higher U.S. economic growth.The veteran CEO of JPMorgan, the world's largest bank by market cap, has previously supported a merit-based system for green cards as well as citizenship for people brought to America as children, and pushed back on proposals to limit H-1B visas. On Wednesday, Dimon urged Trump to allow citizenship \"for hardworking people\" and \"proper asylum\" opportunities.\"I think he can, because he controlled the borders,\" Dimon said.Later in the wide-ranging interview, The Economist Editor-in-Chief Zanny Minton Beddoes, told Dimon that she was surprised at how careful he and other CEOs were in speaking about Trump.\"You are one of the more outspoken business leaders,\" Beddoes said. \"I'm genuinely struck by the unwillingness of CEOs in America to say anything critical. There is a climate of fear in your country.\"Dimon pushed back, saying that he let his views be known about Trump's tariffs, immigration policies and stance towards European allies. \"I think they should change their approach to immigration,\" Dimon said. \"I've said it. What the hell else do you want me to say?\"watch now",

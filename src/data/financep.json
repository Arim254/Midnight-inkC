    "body": "TSMC on Tuesday filed a lawsuit against a former senior vice president it accused of leaking \"confidential information\" to Intel.Wei-Jen Lo joined Intel after 21 years at TSMC, having left in July, the Taiwanese chip maker said in a statement, announcing the lawsuit.The lawsuit is based on Lo's employment contract and non-compete agreement with TSMC, and regulations such as the Trade Secrets Act, the statement said. \"There is a high probability that Lo uses, leaks, discloses, delivers, or transfers TSMC's trade secrets and confidential information to Intel,\" it said. TSMC's share price fell on Tuesday and was last seen over 3% lower. Intel did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment.It follows earlier reports by local media and later by Reuters, which stated Lo may have taken TSMC's technology data to Intel. Taiwan's High Prosecutors opened an investigation into the allegations. Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan told Bloomberg News last week that his \"company respects intellectual property rights\" and denied any wrongdoing. The U.S. firm's stock price moved 1.5% lower in mid-morning trade.",

    "body": "Pedestrians at Pitt Street Mall in Sydney, Australia, on Thursday, July 24, 2025. Brendon Thorne | Bloomberg | Getty Images  Australia's inflation accelerated in October, beating analysts' estimates and rising at its fastest pace in seven months, the Australian Bureau of Statistics said Wednesday. The consumer price index rose 3.8% in October, year on year, marking its fastest pace since adopting a new measure for headline inflation starting April, according to the official release. That was higher than economists' forecast for a 3.6% rise in a Reuters poll. The largest contributor to the elevated inflation was the housing sector, which grew 5.9%. On a monthly basis, the CPI was flat compared to September, versus analysts' estimates for a 0.2% gain. This is the first that that the ABS has released the complete monthly CPI, as the government transitions from the quarterly CPI to using the monthly gauge as the primary measure for headline inflation. Separately, a gauge on Australian business conditions picked up in October, rising to the highest level since March 2024, according to a survey by National Australia Bank earlier this month, as companies reported better sales and profits.The Reserve Bank of Australia held interest rates at 3.6% earlier this month, saying it was cautious about easing further given higher inflation, a stronger-than-expected recovery in consumer demand and a revival in the housing market.

    "body": "Actors Chris Tucker and Jackie Chan arrive to the premiere of \"Rush Hour 3\" at Mann's Chinese Theater on July 30, 2007 in Hollywood, California. Jeff Vespa | WireImage | Getty ImagesA push from President Donald Trump has led Paramount Skydance to revive its \"Rush Hour\" buddy cop movie series, two decades after the last installment, according to multiple reports Tuesday.Paramount has secured funding for the \"Rush Hour 4\" and struck a distribution arrangement with Warner Bros. Discovery, which previously owned the franchise under its New Line banner, Puck's Matthew Belloni first reported. The project had been in limbo for years. Studios were repeatedly approached about a new installment but balked at working with director Brett Ratner, whose career collapsed in 2017 after several actors accused him of sexual misconduct. Ratner has denied the allegations and has never been charged.Under the deal, Paramount will collect a flat distribution fee to release the film in theaters, Variety first reported, while Warner Bros. will take an undisclosed share of box-office receipts before financiers recoup costs.Paramount Skydance nor Warner Bros. Discovery has responded to a request for comment. The first three \"Rush Hour\" films were global hits, particularly in China, earning more than $850 million worldwide, according to box office estimates, and turning Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker into stars. But the new sequel faces a changed theatrical landscape where comedies have struggled at the box office. At 71, Chan has scaled back U.S. studio work, while Tucker hasn't headlined a major film since 2007.Both Chan and Tucker are expected to be in the new film.Paramount has secured funding for \"Rush Hour 4\" and struck a distribution arrangement withTrump's intervention in Hollywood has drawn criticism. He has informally tapped allies including Sylvester Stallone, Jon Voight and Mel Gibson as cultural emissaries, and has repeatedly said he wants to restore what he calls \"classical masculinity\" to studio filmmaking.The White House did not respond to a request for comment. For Paramount, the \"Rush Hour\" revival comes as the newly combined studio aims to nearly double its output, targeting 15 films in 2026 and up to 18 by 2028.The timing also overlaps with a major industry shake-up: Paramount Skydance, Comcast and Netflix have all submitted first-round bids to acquire Warner Bros. The portfolio includes some of entertainment's most valuable franchises, from DC to Harry Potter.Paramount is bidding for all of Warner Bros. Its proposal, previously valued at about $23.50 per share, would bring the entire company — the studio, HBO Max and the cable networks — under one owner.Comcast wants is reported interested in the studio and streaming assets, including Warner Bros. and HBO Max. The deal would fold those pieces into NBCUniversal and let Warner Bros. Discovery spin off CNN and TNT Sports before the deal closes. Netflix is also interested in the film and streaming assets, people familiar with the matter previously told CNBC.Warner Bros. Discovery is aiming to have its sale process wrapped up by mid- to late-December, CNBC previously reported.Disclosure: Comcast is the parent company of NBCUniversal, which owns CNBC. Versant would become the new parent company of CNBC upon Comcast's planned spinoff of Versant.",

    "body": "Colder weather and, for many, some time off for the holidays makes winter a perfect time of year to \"catch up on reading,\" according to billionaire and avid reader Bill Gates.\"There's something about the quieter days around the holidays that makes it easier to sit down with a good book,\" Gates wrote in a blog post published on Tuesday that includes his latest annual list of holiday season book recommendations.Gates' list of \"recent favorites\" includes a wide variety of authors and genres, from a book by a Harvard psychologist that dissects the concept of \"common knowledge\" to a fictional work about an aging night janitor in an aquarium. The list also features a media mogul's recent memoir, a book that Gates calls a \"hopeful, fact-driven overview\" of the current climate crisis, and a nonfiction political bestseller about government regulations and American innovation.DON'T MISS: Exclusive Black Friday discounts on courses to help you earn more money and get ahead at work\"Each of these books pulls back the curtain on how something important really works: how people find purpose later in life, how we should think about climate change, how creative industries evolve, how humans communicate, and how America lost its capacity to build big things — and how to get it back,\" wrote Gates.Here are the five books Gates recommends reading during this holiday season:'Remarkably Bright Creatures' by Shelby Van PeltTold partially from the perspective of an octopus, Van Pelt's 2022 novel meets Gates' top condition for any work of fiction, he wrote: \"I want to read about interesting characters who help me see the world in a new way.\"Gates, who turned 70 in October, also wrote that he related to the book's human protagonist: a 70-year-old widow named Tova, a janitor working the night shift at the aquarium housing Marcellus the octopus. The book follows a developing friendship between Tova and Marcellus, and Gates referred to it as a thought-provoking exploration of \"relationships and getting older,\" particularly struggles with loneliness and the search for meaning as one enters the final chapter of their life.\"Van Pelt's story made me think about the challenge of filling the days after you stop working — and what communities can do to help older people find purpose,\" wrote Gates, who has previously said that retirement \"sounds awful.\"'Clearing the Air' by Hannah RitchieHannah Ritchie is a University of Oxford data scientist who Gates has previously touted for her \"surprisingly optimistic\" analyses of the ongoing fight against climate change. Her latest book — which published in the U.K. on Sept. 18, and is set to publish in the U.S. in March 2026 — \"is one of the clearest explanations of the climate challenge I've read,\" Gates wrote.In \"Clearing the Air,\" Ritchie focuses on 50 questions about the climate crisis — like, whether renewable energy alternatives are too expensive to be effective, or if it's too late to limit global warming and avoid further climate disasters — offering answers that are \"realistic about the risks but grounded in data that shows real progress,\" Gates wrote.Like Ritchie, Gates has touted the environmental movement's progress — from increased use of solar and wind power to the popularity of electric vehicles — and rejected a \"doomsday outlook\" of climate change that the billionaire worries could distract us from other areas of concern, he wrote in a separate blog post in October.Gates has spent decades, and billions of dollars, on combatting climate change. He recently drew some criticism from scientists for arguing that some of the resources earmarked for climate initiatives would be better used on issues like welfare and poverty.\"If you want a hopeful, fact-driven overview of where climate solutions stand, this is a great pick,\" Gates wrote of Ritchie's book on Tuesday.'Who Knew' by Barry DillerBarry Diller, the billionaire IAC and Expedia chairman who also co-founded Fox Broadcasting, published his memoir in May 2025. Even though Gates considers Diller a longtime friend, he wrote, the media mogul's book \"still managed to surprise and teach me a lot about him, his career, and the many industries he's transformed.\"Diller is credited with inventing concepts like the made-for-television movie and TV miniseries during his years as an entertainment executive. Later, Diller \"was early to see the internet's potential and willing to bet on it when others weren't,\" including buying Expedia from Microsoft in 2001 and building IAC into one of the earliest media and internet conglomerates, Gates noted.Gates considered Diller's book to be insightful about the mogul's rise to corporate power, he wrote — and \"raw and honest\" about Diller's personal life, including a decision to come out as gay earlier this year at age 83.'When Everyone Knows That Everyone Knows' by Steven Pinker\"Few people explain the mysteries of human behavior better than Steven Pinker,\" Gates wrote about the professor of psychology at Harvard University who studies how humans interact. Pinker's latest book, which published on Sept. 23, \"is a must-read for anyone who wants to learn more about how people communicate,\" Gates wrote.In \"When Everyone Knows That Everyone Knows,\" Pinker explores how \"common knowledge\" shapes so many aspects of our lives, including how we communicate and work with others. And as Gates wrote: \"Most people would benefit from understanding how common knowledge props up every conversation we have,\" and how to used that shared understanding to more effectively collaborate with others.\"Although the topic itself is pretty complicated, the book is readable and practical, and it made me see everyday social interactions in a new light,\" Gates wrote.'Abundance' by Ezra Klein and Derek ThompsonWritten by two journalists — Thompson is a contributing writer at The Atlantic and Klein is a columnist at The New York Times and co-founder of Vox — \"Abundance\" offers \"a sharp look at why America seems to struggle to build things and what it will take to fix that,\" wrote Gates.Klein and Thompson argue that regulations, particularly some championed by progressive politicians, have stymied U.S. development in areas ranging from infrastructure and affordable housing to scientific breakthroughs. To fix the bottleneck, the writers propose an \"abundance agenda\" that would promote spending on development while cutting back on red tape to help accelerate the pace of new projects.The book has critics on both sides of the political aisle, and Gates wrote that it \"doesn't have all the answers.\" However, the writers \"are asking the right questions\" based on Gates' own experiences working with government agencies on large-scale global health and climate technology projects, he wrote.\"I've seen how the bottlenecks discussed in 'Abundance' impede progress in global health — whether we're trying to improve seeds, design better toilets, or eradicate polio,\" Gates wrote. \"Sometimes the science itself is hard. But often, the logistics and execution are even harder.\"Earn more and get ahead with CNBC's online courses.

    "body": "U.S. President Donald Trump looks at Gobble one of two turkeys to ceremonially pardoned for Thanksgiving in the Rose Garden at the White House in Washington, D.C., U.S., November 25, 2025. Jonathan Ernst | ReutersGobble and Waddle won't get gobbled this Thanksgiving — they're waddling off to freedom instead after President Donald Trump granted pardons to those two turkeys on Tuesday.During the traditional Rose Garden ceremony in which the birds get spared from the butcher, Trump also suggested a U.S.-brokered peace deal between Ukraine and Russia soon could come to fruition.\"I think we're getting very close to a deal; we'll find out,\" Trump said. \"I think we're making progress.\"Trump also bashed former President Joe Biden, claiming that his predecessor used an autopen to sign last year's turkey pardons, making them \"totally invalid.\" Trump cracked that he has \"officially pardoned\" those other birds, Peach and Blossom, adding that he \"saved them in the nick of time.\"Gobble and Waddle were raised on a small farm in Wayne County, North Carolina, owned by Travis and Amanda Pittman, who raised turkeys for Butterball.First lady Melania Trump's office had encouraged Americans to text \"Gobble\" or \"Waddle\" to 45470 to decide which bird would receive the formal pardon. Earlier this year, she posted a poll on X to name the birds.Born in July and weighing 52 and 50 pounds respectively, Gobble and Waddle spent the past week getting used to noise, lights, and crowds before checking into their ceremonial suite at the Willard InterContinental Hotel — a long-running perk of being a presidential turkey.The National Thanksgiving Turkeys from North Carolina, named Waddle and Gobble, wait in their room a day ahead of their Thanksgiving holiday pardoning at the White House, at the Willard InterContinental Hotel in Washington, D.C., U.S., November 24, 2025. Nathan Howard | ReutersWhite House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt holds her son Nicholas as Waddle, one of the National Thanksgiving turkeys, visits the press briefing room of the White House, prior to the turkey pardoning ceremony with US President Donald Trump on November 25, 2025, in Washington, DC. Alex Wroblewski | Afp | Getty ImagesExperts previously told CNBC that retailers who ordered turkeys early locked in lower prices, while others relying on the spot market are facing steeper costs. Wells Fargo's agriculture team said there could be a $20 difference in the price of comparably sized turkeys depending on where consumers shopped.Major retailers have offered holiday promotions to lure cost-conscious shoppers.Walmart is advertising a dinner bundle for 10 people for under $56; Aldi has one for $40; Amazon is offering a $25 dinner promotion; and Target announced a $20 Thanksgiving deal for four.Despite elevated turkey prices, the broader Thanksgiving meal for 10 is less expensive for the third straight year, according to the AFBF. A \"classic\" 16-pound turkey dinner with sides averages $55.18 nationwide.The annual turkey presentation dates to the 1940s and became a formal presidential pardon in 1989 under George H. W. Bush. But presidents have been gifted turkeys since the 1870s, according to the White House Historical Association. Over time, the rite has evolved into soft marketing for America's multibillion-dollar  poultry industry.This year's moment of pageantry comes in a second term where Trump has leaned heavily on his actual pardon power, granting relief to more than 1,000 January 6 rioters and high-profile figures including former Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich, disgraced former representative George Santos and former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani. ",

    "body": "Elon Musk attends the U.S.-Saudi Investment Forum in Washington, D.C., U.S., November 19, 2025. Evelyn Hockstein | ReutersElon Musk's artificial intelligence startup xAI is expected to close a $15 billion round at a $230 billion pre-money valuation next month, sources familiar with the matter told CNBC's David Faber.The deadline for allocation is the end of day on Tuesday, with the round expected to close on Dec. 19, the sources said.This confirms earlier CNBC reporting that the company was raising $15 billion. The Tesla CEO later called the report on the round \"False\" in a post on the social media platform X.At the time, sources told CNBC that xAI would use a large portion of the money for funding graphics processing units responsible for powering large language models. CNBC had previously reported in September that the startup was looking to raise $10 billion at a $200 billion valuation.The funding round is yet another sign of the insatiable demand for AI tools. Companies, including OpenAI and Anthropic, have raised billions and reached sky-high valuations as investors pour more money into companies building foundational AI models. Sam Altman's OpenAI finalized a $6.6 billion-share sale at a $500 billion valuation last month, and Reuters recently reported that the ChatGPT maker was eying a $1 trillion initial public offering.Anthropic closed a $13 billion funding round in September that roughly tripled its valuation from March.Musk's xAI is responsible for creating the Grok chatbot that has come under fire for disseminating hate speech, including antisemitic content. The company recently debuted Grokipedia, an AI-powered competitor to Wikipedia. In March, Musk announced the merger of xAI with X in a deal valuing the social media platform at $33 billion.",

    "body": "An Abercrombie & Fitch store stands in midtown Manhattan in New York City on Oct. 24, 2024.Spencer Platt | Getty ImagesShares of Abercrombie & Fitch soared 37% Tuesday after the company showed investors it's set to keep growing, even as its namesake brand slows down. During the apparel retailer's fiscal third quarter, Abercrombie brand sales fell 2%. But for at least the third quarter in a row, Hollister saved the retailer, as sales climbed 16%. CEO Fran Horowitz said sales at Abercrombie are expected to be flat in the current quarter, indicating growth at Hollister is set to drive the company's holiday shopping season. Companywide, sales rose 7%, beating expectations. Here's how the apparel retailer did in the period ended Nov. 1 compared with what Wall Street was anticipating, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:Earnings per share: $2.36 vs. $2.16 expectedRevenue: $1.29 billion vs. $1.28 billion expectedThe company's reported net income for the quarter was $113 million, or $2.36 per share, compared with $131.98 million, or $2.50 per share, a year earlier.  Sales rose to $1.29 billion, up about 7% from $1.21 billion a year earlier.  The company's namesake banner has fueled its comeback in recent years, but now that the Abercrombie brand's growth has started to moderate, Hollister has picked up the baton. During the quarter, Abercrombie's sales fell to $617.35 million while comparable sales declined by a staggering 7%. Sales came in far below the $631.8 million analysts were expecting, according to StreetAccount. Meanwhile, Hollister's revenue rose to $673.27 million, well above the $649.7 million analysts had expected, according to StreetAccount. Comparable sales rose 15%.As the retailer heads into the peak shopping season, \"Hollister's exciting campaigns and collaborations planned will highlight some must haves,\" Horowitz said on a call with analysts. \"We are just getting started and importantly, our team has been reading and reacting and has the right product to support sales throughout the season.\" She also said Abercrombie is investing more in the Hollister brand, as the company is on pace to open 25 stores and refresh 35 others this year.At the Abercrombie brand, Horowitz said last quarter that the slowdown was related to old inventory the company needed to mark down to sell. She said she expected the brand to be back to growth by the end of the year, but that no longer seems to be the case. During Abercrombie's conference call, executives didn't answer when asked when the brand will return to growth. It spoke about the \"sequential improvement\" Abercrombie saw after a 5% decline in revenue in the previous quarter. Horowitz pointed to recent collaborations with the NFL and luxury retailer Kemo Sabe as bright spots for the brand. \"Abercrombie Brands has inventory in the right place and a strong marketing plan heading into holiday,\" said Horowtiz. \"We've opened 30 new stores in the third quarter, aiming for a total of 36 stores this year. We remain focused on bringing the brand back to growth.\" For its holiday quarter, Abercrombie is expecting companywide sales to climb between 4% and 6%, which is largely below Wall Street expectations of 5.6% growth, according to LSEG. It anticipates earnings per share will be between $3.40 and $3.70, roughly in line with expectations of $3.55 per share. For the full year, it now expects sales to rise between 6% and 7%, largely beating expectations of 6.2% growth, according to LSEG.

We're grateful for his contributions and wish him continued success. With hardware and software engineering unified under Global Product, we're integrating product management with engineering to accelerate the delivery of exceptional in-vehicle experiences,\" GM said in an emailed statement to CNBC.Cetinok, who joined GM in September 2023 after stints with companies such as Apple, Microsoft and Amazon, could not immediately be reached for comment. The announcement of his departure comes a month after he described his position as \"a product person's dream\" in an interview with CNBC.GM's senior vice president of software and services engineering, Dave Richardson, and its head of GM artificial intelligence, Barak Turovsky, have also left the company since October. Richardson was with GM for more than two years, while Turovsky was hired in March.GM Chief Product Officer Sterling Anderson during the automaker's \"GM Forward\" event on Oct. 22, 2025 in New York City.Michael Wayland / CNBCAnderson left the self-driving company he cofounded, Aurora Innovation, to join GM. He told CNBC last month that in order for the automaker to succeed, software and product must be thought of as one and the same.\"That's the point of the role, I think, is it brings together all of these pieces into a unified approach to how we do product going forward,\" Anderson said during an Oct. 22 interview at a GM technology event in New York.Anderson, a former McKinsey & Co. consultant who later led Tesla's AutoPilot program, said his goal is to accelerate the pace of GM's innovations.When Anderson's appointment with GM was announced in May, Cetinok said in a LinkedIn post he was \"delighted to welcome\" the executive to the company. GM CEO Mary Barra and GM President Mark Reuss also hailed Anderson as being equipped to \"evolve\" and \"reinvent\" the automaker's operations.The global automotive industry has battled for years to better integrate technology into vehicles – from their production to consumer-facing software and remote, or \"over-the-air,\" updates like Tesla pioneered.GM has taken an aggressive approach to combat such challenges by hiring leaders from Tesla and technology companies such as Apple and Google. However, many times, such executives have had short tenures with the company.",

    "body": "watch nowWeak buyer demand, weakening home prices and overall uncertainty in the economy are combining to make home sellers change their minds and step out of the market. Close to 85,000 U.S. sellers took their homes off the market in September, up 28% from September 2024 and the highest level for that month in eight years, according to Redfin. Sellers are delisting because so many listings are going stale, sitting on the market longer and longer. Redfin reported that 70% of listings in September were on the market for 60 days or longer. Homeowners are seeing prices weaken significantly and would rather wait than accept a low offer. Prices in September were 1.3% higher year over year, down from a 1.4% rise in August, according to the S&P Cotality Case-Shiller U.S. National Home Price NSA Index. Get Property Play directly to your inboxCNBC's Property Play with Diana Olick covers new and evolving opportunities for the real estate investor, delivered weekly to your inbox.Subscribe here to get access today.\"The frequency of delistings is keeping inventory tighter than it looks on paper,\" said Asad Khan, a senior economist at Redfin. \"When tens of thousands of homeowners pull their homes off the market rather than accept a low offer, it effectively reduces the supply of homes that are actually available for buyers. That keeps sale prices elevated.\" Some sellers are lowering prices — even multiple times. The typical price cut is roughly $10,000, but multiple reductions are becoming more common as homes take longer to sell, according to Zillow. The typical listing saw $25,000 in cumulative price cuts in October, matching the largest discounts Zillow has ever recorded.The housing market is now heading into its slowest season. While 1 in 5 homes that are delisted are relisted, that may not happen for several months, as sellers will likely wait for the much busier spring season to try again. Home prices are still 50% higher than they were just five years ago, but some sellers who bought in the last few years are facing potential losses. Roughly 15% of the homes that were delisted in September were at risk of selling at a loss, the highest share in five years, according to Redfin.The supply of homes for sale is about 15% higher now than it was a year ago, according to Realtor.com, but that is likely to shrink in the coming weeks, both because of the season and because of weakening consumer sentiment among buyers and sellers alike. Pending sales in October, which are based on signed contracts, were up 1.9% month to month and basically flat from a year ago, according to the Realtors. The monthly bump may have been due to a small drop in mortgage rates, which then turned higher again in November. ",

But I think things are moving along very well.\"Trump has been a fierce Fed critic and recently said he'd \"love\" to fire Powell and encouraged Bessent to \"work on\" the chair to get the central bank to lower its key interest rate. Referring to Bessent, Trump even joked that \"if you don't get it fixed fast, I'm gonna fire your ass.\"\"If you were in the room, he was joking,\" Bessent said. \"We've gotten to this point where monetary policy has gotten very complicated, and it's more than just cutting rates.\"Powell's term expires in May 2026, and before then he is expected to have his hands full with a suddenly divided Federal Open Market Committee that is split over the need for further cuts. Based on a recent statement from New York Fed President John Williams, markets largely expect the FOMC to approve a third consecutive cut at the December meeting.In the meantime, Bessent is continuing to interview chair candidates. The slate of finalists is believed to include National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett, former Governor Kevin Warsh, BlackRock executive Rick Rieder, and current Fed Governors Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman. Bloomberg News, citing sources familiar with matter, reported Tuesday that Hassett is the front-runner for the job. The White House downplayed speculation about Trump's preference.\"Until an announcement is made by President Trump, discussion about Fed nominations is speculation,\" White House spokesman Kush Desai told CNBC.com Bessent said he envisions a different role for the Fed from the dominating position it has had since the financial crisis over the economy and financial markets.\"I think we've got to kind of simplify things,\" he said. \"I think it's time for the Fed just to move back into the background, like, it used to do, calm things down and work for the American people.\"watch now",

Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington, DC on November 19, 2025. Brendan Smialowski | Afp | Getty ImagesNvidia on Tuesday said its tech remains a generation ahead of the industry, in response to Wall Street's concerns that the company's dominance of AI infrastructure could be threatened by Google's AI chips.\"We're delighted by Google's success — they've made great advances in AI and we continue to supply to Google,\" Nvidia said in a post on X. \"NVIDIA is a generation ahead of the industry — it's the only platform that runs every AI model and does it everywhere computing is done.\"The post came after Nvidia saw its shares fall 3% on Tuesday after a report that Meta, one of its key customers, could strike a deal with Google to use its tensor processing units for its data centers. In its post, Nvidia said its chips are more flexible and powerful compared with so-called ASIC chips — such as Google's TPUs — which are designed for a single company or function. Nvidia's latest generation of chips are known as Blackwell. \"NVIDIA offers greater performance, versatility, and fungibility than ASICs,\" Nvidia said in its post. Nvidia has more than 90% of the market for artificial intelligence chips with its graphics processors, analysts say, but Google's in-house chips have gotten increased attention in recent weeks as a viable alternative to the Blackwell chips, which are expensive but powerful. Unlike Nvidia, Google doesn't sell its TPU chips to other companies, but it uses them for internal tasks and allows companies to rent them through Google Cloud. Earlier this month, Google released Gemini 3, a well-reviewed state-of-the-art AI model that was trained on the company's TPUs, not Nvidia GPUs. \"We are experiencing accelerating demand for both our custom TPUs and Nvidia GPUs,\" a Google spokesperson said in a statement. \"We are committed to supporting both, as we have for years.\"Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang addressed rising TPU competition on an earnings call earlier this month, noting that Google was a customer for his company's GPU chips and that Gemini can run on Nvidia's technology. He also mentioned that he was in touch with Demis Hassabis, the CEO of Google DeepMind. Huang said that Hassabis texted him to say that the tech industry theory that using more chips and data will create more powerful AI models — often called \"scaling laws\" by AI developers — is \"intact.\" Nvidia says that scaling laws will lead to even more demand for the company's chips and systems.

    "body": "Ugur Karakoc | E+ | Getty ImagesAs tax season approaches, the IRS has released guidance for workers who can claim the federal deduction for tips and overtime pay enacted via President Donald Trump's \"big beautiful bill.\"The guidance released last week covers how to report these deductions on tax returns. But workers could still face questions at tax time, experts say. The tip provision allows certain workers to deduct up to $25,000 in \"qualified tips\" from 2025 through 2028. The tax break phases out once modified adjusted gross income exceeds $150,000, or $300,000 for married couples filing jointly.      Meanwhile, Trump's tax break for eligible overtime pay offers a deduction of up to $12,500 for single filers or $25,000 for joint filers, with the same income phaseouts. This provision is also temporary, in effect from 2025 through 2028.    Read more CNBC personal finance coverageIRS releases guidance for Trump's tips, overtime deductions.

Here’s what to knowCNBC's Financial Advisor 100: Best financial advisors, top firms for 2025 rankedWorkers can deduct tips or overtime pay if those earnings are reported via so-called information returns, such as Forms W-2 or 1099, according to the legislation. While the IRS is \"strongly encouraging\" employers to provide this reporting, it's not required for tax year 2025, said Thomas Gorczynski, a Tempe, Arizona-based enrolled agent, which is a tax license to practice before the IRS. Gorczynski, who also educates tax professionals on legislation changes, said: \"We're going to have this hodgepodge, weird year of rules that's going to make reporting very difficult for employees.\"Approximately 6 million workers report tipped wages, according to IRS estimates. And nationally, about 6% of workers reported overtime pay in 2024, according to the Peter G. Peterson Foundation, an economic organization. These taxpayers will soon have to navigate Trump's tip and overtime deductions for 2025, which apply to their returns filed in 2026.  \"Taxpayer confusion will be off the charts at tax time on these provisions,\" Terry Lemons, former communications and liaison chief for the IRS, said in a LinkedIn post last week. 'Transition relief' for some tipped workersThe new IRS guidance also includes \"transition relief\" for certain workers who receive tips via a so-called \"specified service trade or businesses,\" or SSTBs.Trump's 2017 tax law outlined the list of SSTBs to limit eligibility for a 20% deduction for certain businesses, and includes sectors like health care, legal, financial services, performing arts and more.SSTB workers are excluded from claiming the new tip deduction under Trump's \"big beautiful bill.\" But these workers may briefly be eligible for the tip deduction until the Treasury Department and IRS finalize regulations.\"I don't want people to think that this new waiver is the permanent provision or a permanent guidance,\" Gorczynski said.It's a \"temporary waiver\" for some SSTB workers to claim the tip deduction for 2025, he said. But there could be an \"unhappy surprise\" in 2026 and future years if eligibility goes away.watch now",

    "body": "Enrique Lores, President and Chief Executive Officer of HP Inc. speaks at COMPUTEX forum in Taipei, Taiwan June 3, 2024. Ann Wang | ReutersPC and printer maker HP Inc. said Tuesday it'll lower its headcount by 4,000 to 6,000 people, representing a cut of up to 10%. HP also issued a lower-than-expected earnings projection for the new fiscal year. Shares of the company fell 6% in extended trading.Here's how HP did versus LSEG consensus estimates:EPS: 93 cents adjusted vs. 92 cents expectedRevenue: $14.64 billion vs. $14.48 billion expectedHP's revenue increased 4% year over year in the quarter, which ended on Oct. 31, according to a statement. Net income of $795 million, or 84 cents per share, was up from $763 million, or 80 cents per share, in the same quarter a year ago.For the first quarter of HP's fiscal 2026, the company called for 73 cents to 81 cents in adjusted net earnings per share, while the LSEG consensus was 79 cents. For all of fiscal 2026, HP sees $2.90 to $3.20 in adjusted per share, below the LSEG consensus of $3.33.\"HP's outlook reflects the added cost driven by the current U.S. trade-related regulations in place, and associated mitigations,\" the company said in the statement.The company's personal systems unit that includes desktop and laptop computers contributed $10.35 billion in revenue, up 8% and above StreetAccount's $10.15 billion consensus.HP said it expects to complete the headcount reduction by the end of fiscal 2028. The company said the restructuring will result in savings of at least $1 billion in annualized gross run rate by the end of fiscal 2028. HP said it expects to incur about $650 million in charges, of which $250 million will happen in fiscal 2026.\"As we look ahead, we see a significant opportunity to embed AI into HP to accelerate product innovation, improve customer satisfaction and boost productivity,\" HP CEO Enrique Lores said on a conference call with analysts. Corporate executives across industries are hoping to draw on generative artificial intelligence products to speed up software developers and automate customer service. Cloud providers are buying large supplies of memory to meet computing demand from companies that build AI models, such as Anthropic and OpenAI, leading to a rise in the cost per gigabyte of RAM this year. HP, whose headcount stood at 58,000 as of December, announced a similarly sized round of layoffs in 2022. Several other technology companies have announced layoffs in recent months as U.S. consumers face higher prices and interest rates.\"Memory costs are currently 15 to 18% of the cost of a typical PC, and while an increase was expected, its rate has accelerated in the last few weeks,\" Lores said.The company does expect to benefit after Microsoft stopped supporting its Windows 10 operating system in October, which will lead people to buy new machines, Lores said. Around 60% of HP's installed base has moved to Windows 11, he said.HP's printing business did $4.3 billion in revenue, down 4%. The pricing environment is competitive, and customers are putting off purchases of new models, said Karen Parkhill, the company's finance chief.As of Tuesday's close, HP shares were down 25% for the year, while the S&P 500 index has gained 15% in the same period.WATCH: HP CEO: Tariffs are mostly nonmaterialwatch now",

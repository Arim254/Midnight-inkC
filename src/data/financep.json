    "body": "The U.S. Capitol building is seen on Feb. 17, 2026 in Washington, DC.Heather Diehl | Getty ImagesA man carrying a shotgun and wearing a \"tactical vest\" on Tuesday got out of a car and ran toward the U.S. Capitol before being stopped by police officers stationed outside the building, law enforcement said.Officers ordered the man to drop the weapon and he complied, U.S. Capitol Police Chief Michael Sullivan told reporters Tuesday afternoon. The man then laid down on the ground and was taken into custody, Sullivan said.He \"also had tactical gloves, and when we looked in the vehicle, he had a Kevlar helmet and a gas mask in the vehicle,\" according to Sullivan.The man's shotgun was loaded, and he was carrying additional rounds, the police chief said. Sullivan commended the officers who apprehended the suspect, adding this is why police at the Capitol conduct monthly active-shooter exercises.\"Who knows what could have happened if we wouldn't have officers here standing guard like they do every single day,\" he said.Read more CNBC politics coverageEpstein files: DOJ says it logs Congress members' searches to 'protect' victim informationEpstein files: AG Pam Bondi seemed to have Rep.

    "body": "Michael Selig, President Donald Trump's nominee to serve as Commodity Futures Trading Commission chairman, testifies in a Senate Agriculture Committee hearing on his nomination on Capitol Hill, Nov. 19, 2025.Jonathan Ernst | ReutersThe Commodity Futures Trading Commission filed an amicus brief in federal court on Tuesday to assert the agency's right to enforce prediction markets instead of individual states, according to its new chairman, Michael Selig.Selig argued in a Monday Wall Street Journal op-ed that the CFTC has always had authority over prediction markets and determining whether the event contracts constitute gambling, as critics allege. Selig noted nearly 50 active legal cases against prediction markets and said the CFTC would be stepping in to prevent state encroachment.\"The CFTC will no longer sit idly by while overzealous state governments undermine the agency's exclusive jurisdiction over these markets by seeking to establish statewide prohibitions on these exciting products,\" he wrote.The move comes as prediction markets like Kalshi and Polymarket face legal challenges in multiple states over event contracts. The platforms allow users to bet on the outcomes of events in pop culture, sports, entertainment and more.Critics of prediction markets have argued that the offerings amount to little more than gambling, though Kalshi has defended its platform and argued that it abides by federal regulations. Sports betting on the prediction platforms has drawn comparisons to legalized sports betting in the U.S. In his first public comments as CFTC chairman at the end of January, Selig said he was prepared to draft new, clear rules to govern prediction markets and revisit the agency's rules on involvement in federal and circuit court cases.\"Where jurisdictional questions are at issue, the Commission has the expertise and responsibility to defend its exclusive jurisdiction over commodity derivatives,\" he said at the time.In his Monday op-ed, Selig said event contracts \"serve legitimate economic functions\" and operate under CFTC rules as \"swaps\" rather than gambling. He also posited that trading on event contracts is beneficial for the market and for Americans at large.\"These exchanges aren't the Wild West, as some critics claim, but self-regulatory organizations that are examined and supervised by experienced CFTC staff,\" Selig wrote.In a Tuesday video posted to X, Selig said his message to those who challenge the CFTC's authority is clear: \"We will see you in court.\"\"Today, the CFTC is taking an important step to ensure that these markets have a place here in America and have the integrity and resilience and vibrancy that our derivative markets deserve,\" he said.Selig said the amicus brief would be filed in the Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in support of Crypto.com in its dispute with the Nevada Gaming Control Board.CNBC could not verify that the amicus brief had been filed.Disclosure: CNBC and Kalshi have a commercial relationship that includes a CNBC minority investment.",

The conference brings together leaders in business, government, technology, philanthropy, academia, and the media to discuss actionable and collaborative solutions to some of the most important questions of our time. Photographer: Dania Maxwell/Bloomberg via Getty ImagesBloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesHyatt Hotels Chairman Thomas Pritzker said Monday that he would retire and renounced his relationship with sex predator Jeffrey Epstein.Pritzker will leave his post as the hotel chain's executive chairman — a role he's held for more than two decades — immediately, he said in a statement released by the Pritzker Organization. The 75-year-old billionaire Hyatt heir said he would not seek reelection to the board at the annual stockholder meeting.\"My job and responsibility is to provide good stewardship. That is important to me,\" Pritzker said in the statement. \"Good stewardship includes ensuring a proper transition at Hyatt.\"Pritzker said he has \"regret\" over his connection to Epstein and his accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell. Epstein plead guilty to state criminal charges related to soliciting prostitution, including one charge involving a minor, in Florida in 2008. He killed himself in 2019 after being arrested for federal child sex trafficking charges.Recently released files show Pritzker and Epstein exchanged friendly emails after the disgraced financier's 2008 plea deal. Being part of the release of thousands of documents and photos does not imply any wrongdoing.\"I exercised terrible judgment in maintaining contact with them, and there is no excuse for failing to distance myself sooner,\" Pritzker said in the statement. \"I condemn the actions and the harm caused by Epstein and Maxwell and I feel deep sorrow for the pain they inflicted on their victims.\"Following his retirement, Pritzker said he would focus attention on a science foundation he began.Pritzker's announcement marks the latest in a series of high-profile resignations as more details about Epstein's dealings become public. Former Goldman Sachs Legal Chief Kathryn Ruemmler and Paul Weiss Chair Brad Karp were both among the latest business leaders to step down from their positions. Both Ruemmler and Karp and have said they regret their connections to Epstein and that coverage of their ties were creating distractions for the companies they represented.Hyatt said its board appointed CEO Mark Hoplamazian to succeed Pritzker as chair starting immediately. Board member Richard Tuttle thanked Pritzker for his work and called him \"instrumental\" in determining the Chicago-based company's strategy in a press release.",

    "body": "Mike's Red Tacos, based in San Diego, is best known for its birria tacos, but its menu features more than just the buzzy regional Mexican food.Source: Mike's Red TacosThe restaurant investors behind the success of Dave's Hot Chicken are making a new nationwide bet on the next-hottest restaurant trend: birria.Mike's Red Tacos, a San Diego-based birria chain with just two locations, plans to announce on Tuesday a new franchising initiative that will build hundreds of restaurants across the U.S., with support from early-stage backers Bill Phelps and Andrew Feghali, CNBC can report. Financial terms of their investment, which took place in early 2025, were not disclosed.\"We just saw that this was a brand and a concept that really had legs to it,\" Phelps told CNBC. \"And then the critical thing is, we brought down prospective franchisees. ... Everyone gave it the thumbs up.\"Phelps said he had never heard of birria before Feghali introduced him to Mike's.Traditional birria is a beef or goat stew, slow cooked with spices and chiles to give the meat lots of flavor. Birria tacos, like those sold at Mike's, use the slow-cooked meat as a filling and usually include a consomme on the side as a dip for the taco. Once known as a regional Mexican food, birria now appears on 3.7% of U.S. menus, according to Datassential. That's more than quadruple its menu penetration four years ago, based on the firm's data, but there's still a long runway before it reaches ubiquity.Mexican-inspired fast-food brands such as Qdoba, El Pollo Loco, Del Taco and even Taco Bell have released their own versions of birria. And there's at least 478 restaurant operators running birria-focused restaurants, according to Datassential.Mike's menu also includes burritos, loaded nachos and fries, and birria ramen.\"It appeals to a very broad range of guests — it's not just your millennials and Gen Zs,\" Phelps said, speaking about the customers in Mike's Red Tacos restaurants. \"There's older people in the restaurant, there's little kids, so it's got a very, very broad appeal.\"Phelps co-founded Wetzel's Pretzels in 1994 and became a founding investor in Blaze Pizza, the fast-casual pizza chain founded by Elise and Rick Wetzel. In 2019, Phelps joined Dave's Hot Chicken as an investor and CEO, using franchising to expand the chain quickly to hundreds of restaurants worldwide. Last year, private equity firm Roark Capital bought a majority stake in Dave's Hot Chicken in deal worth roughly $1 billion.Feghali was one of the first franchisees of Dave's Hot Chicken. He is also one of the nation's largest Little Caesars operators. Together, Feghali and Phelps founded Four Wall Partners, a restaurant franchising investment firm. In addition to being early-stage investors in Mike's, they will act as advisors and members of the chain's board. Vincent Montanelli, who most recently served as chief executive of Wetzel's, has joined Mike's to serve as president.Founded originally as a food truck five years ago, Mike's Red Tacos opened its first brick-and-mortar location in 2022. Founder Mike Touma plans to open his third location in March; he'll stay on with the company as a board member and franchisee of the chain's San Diego locations.\"We put together a deal where [Touma is] going to keep the rights to his stores and future stores in San Diego, and then we're going to franchise it across the rest of the U.S. and internationally,\" Phelps said.The new team plans to follow the established playbook used by Wetzel's and Dave's to grow Mike's Red Tacos quickly.\"We're going to be very aggressive where we grow with this, because we've seen that we can do that,\" Phelps said.The taco chain has already secured franchising development deals with multi-unit operators for more than 200 locations nationwide, from California to Texas to New England. Some of those franchised restaurants could open as soon as the end of the year.Phelps anticipates stiff competition from national chains and local taco restaurants alike. However, he said he thinks that the chain's simple menu, delicious food and an aggressive marketing strategy can help Mike's overtake rivals. \"We think this can be a winner,\" Phelps said.",

    "body": "Andreypopov | Istock | Getty ImagesThe Trump administration has identified more than 40,000 borrowers eligible for federal student loan forgiveness in January, a recent court filing revealed.More than 10,800 of the borrowers who qualified for the debt cancellation were enrolled in the U.S. Department of Education's Income-Based Repayment Plan; another over 10,700 were in the Income-Contingent Repayment Plan; and 820 borrowers were enrolled in the Pay as You Earn Repayment Plan. Those three programs are all known as income-driven repayment plans. IDRs limit a borrower's monthly bill to a share of their discretionary income and cancel any remaining debt after a certain period, typically 20 or 25 years. Another 18,160 federal student loan borrowers had their debts cancelled in January through the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program, the Education Department said in its recent court filing. Signed into law in 2007 by President George W. Bush, PSLF offers debt cancellation to those who've worked for 10 years at certain not-for-profit organizations or the federal government.Read more CNBC personal finance coverageParents with student debt face deadline to secure affordable repayment, forgivenessSecure 2.0 let employers pair emergency savings and 401(k)s, but few have done soHome sellers start getting lower prices at 70, research shows — here's whyAverage IRS tax refund is up 10.9% so far this season, early filing data showsEarly estimates point to lower Social Security COLA for 2027Senators call for longer Social Security Fairness Act lump-sum payment timelineHere's the inflation breakdown for January 2026 — in one chartAverage tax refund is up 22%, Bessent says — what filers can expect this seasonK-shaped economy looks like 'jaws of a crocodile,' economist says: Here's whyHow EPA 'endangerment finding' repeal could impact your walletMedical emergencies can lead to debt and bankruptcy — even for insured AmericansBigger tax refunds may be coming — but missing key forms could risk an auditHow Social Security Fairness Act payments may affect beneficiaries' taxesCredit card debt tops $1.28 trillion, consistent with 'K-shaped' economy: NY FedHow affordability led to a chasm between stock prices, consumer optimismStudent loan complaints at record high, CFPB finds, but agency omits detailsCNBC's Financial Advisor 100: Best financial advisors, top firms rankedThe January numbers suggest the Trump administration is increasing its efforts to ease the financial burden of student loan debt.Amid a barrage of recent changes to the federal lending system and sweeping layoffs at the Education Department in March, many student loan holders have struggled to access the loan-forgiveness opportunities available under their borrowing terms. More than 42 million Americans hold student loans, with total outstanding debt exceeding $1.6 trillion, according to the Congressional Research Service.Education Department officials agreed to share status updates on the processing of student loan discharges as part of an October settlement with the American Federation of Teachers, a teachers' union representing some 1.8 million members. The AFT sued the Trump administration last year, accusing officials of denying student loan borrowers their legal rights.\"Thanks to our lawsuit, 20,000 more teachers, nurses, firefighters and public service workers finally got their debt discharged,\" said AFT president Randi Weingarten.'Golden emails' on student loan forgiveness The borrowers deemed eligible for IDR forgiveness in January have not yet had their debts discharged, Education Department officials said in the court filing. The department usually provides borrowers with a short period to opt out of the debt cancellation. \"These people should be getting their notices in February,\" said Nancy Nierman, assistant director of the Education Debt Consumer Assistance Program in New York.\"In fact, we have several clients who got the 'golden email' this month,\" Nierman said, referencing the term some borrowers use to describe the Education Department electronic message confirming their debt cancellation.Backlog remains for affordable repayment plans More than 626,000 federal student loan holders remain stuck in a backlog of applications for an affordable repayment plan, the Education Department reported. Many borrowers rely on IDR plans in order to afford their monthly payments, consumer advocates say.However, the Education Department has made progress on processing the applications: Approximately 734,000 requests were pending in December, compared with nearly 1.4 million in July. However, the PSLF buyback pileup continues to grow, with more than 86,520 borrowers in the queue in January, up from 83,370 in December and 80,210 in November. The buyback option allows borrowers pursuing PSLF to retroactively pay for any months they missed because of a forbearance or deferment, accelerating their timeline to forgiveness. The Education Department said in January it had approved 1,980 buyback applications.

The minister did not name any specific platforms or companies that the Indian government is talking to.Any crackdown in India, a country of over 1.4 billion people, could have a major impact on companies from Meta to Google, which have hundreds of millions of users in the nation. While India has not yet decided on such a move, the comments are among the first publicly from a top official in government. India now joins a growing chorus of governments that are debating whether to restrict children from certain platforms, following Australia's move in December to ban users under the age of 16 from accessing major social media platforms. Read moreAustralia became the world's first country to enact such a rule, with other countries now looking to follow suit. Denmark late last year approved a new rule to block under-15s from social media platforms, while Spain this month said it would ban under-16s from social media. Meta's Facebook, WhatsApp and Instagram platforms are estimated to be among the most popular apps in India while there is also a big audience for Google's YouTube.  ",

Schumer, D-N.Y., and other Democrats are locked in negotiations with President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans about imposing new restrictions on federal immigration agents in exchange for funding DHS. The agency shut down early Saturday morning after two weeks of stopgap funding ran out. The negotiations over DHS funding are heightened after federal immigration agents shot and killed two U.S. citizens during an immigration surge in Minneapolis. Democrats demanded that DHS funding be stripped from a package appropriating money for a handful of other agencies in the wake of the shootings and forced negotiations on immigration enforcement. The Trump administration has since said it would wind down the Minneapolis operation. Democrats didn't say what's in their counteroffer. Schumer's office didn't respond to an email seeking comment on details of the proposal.Read more CNBC politics coverageEpstein files: DOJ says it logs Congress members' searches to 'protect' victim informationEpstein files: AG Pam Bondi seemed to have Rep.

Mark Kelly over troops video, for nowWatch Pam Bondi hearing: AG touts record Dow as Democrats grill her over Trump, EpsteinDemocrats have pushed for a ban on agents masking their faces, mandatory body cameras, a requirement for judicial warrants for immigration arrests and an end to \"roving patrols,\" among other priorities. The White House and Republicans have pushed back on the mask ban and judicial warrant requirements.The White House sent an initial counteroffer to a Democratic proposal last week. Democrats threw cold water on that, arguing it did not adequately address their concerns. Democrats have less incentive to capitulate during this latest spending standoff, especially given the limited scope of the shutdown and recent polling showing that most Americans feel Trump's immigration policy has gone too far.\"Built into this is the substantially changing politics of immigration. I think Republicans are still acting like they hold a straight flush on immigration, but they clearly are only holding a pair of threes,\" Jared Leopold, a Democratic strategist who has worked on the Hill and for the Democratic Senate Campaign Committee, said in an interview.Many DHS employees are still working despite the shutdown, as much of the agency is deemed essential during a closure and parts of it are funded through last year's massive tax and spending bill. But essential employees may be forced to work without pay if the shutdown drags on for a long time. That includes employees at DHS subagencies, including the Transportation Security Administration, Coast Guard and the Federal Emergency Management Agency.Immigration enforcement operations at Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Customs and Border Patrol can largely proceed unaffected by the shutdown. Congressional Republicans injected hundreds of billions of dollars into the agency's law enforcement apparatus as part of the party-line \"One Big Beautiful Bill\" law. The rest of the government is funded through Sept. 30. ",

Tensions remain high between Iran and the U.S. President Donald Trump has threatened strikes on the Islamic Republic if it does not cut a deal over its nuclear program.Iran conducted war games Tuesday in the Strait of Hormuz, a trade choke point that is vital for international crude supplies. Traffic through the strait was suspended for several hours as Iran's Revolutionary Guard held naval exercises, according to the Tasnim news agency. About one-third of all waterborne crude oil exports pass through the strait, according to data from consulting firm Kpler.

    "body": "Qwen3 is Alibaba's latest large language model, which it says combines traditional LLM capabilities with \"advanced, dynamic reasoning.\"Sopa Images | Lightrocket | Getty ImagesAlibaba Group has released its newest AI model series, featuring enhanced capabilities, as it faces intensifying competition in China's AI space with several models launched in the past week. The Qwen3.5 AI model comes in an open-weight version, which allows users to download, run, fine-tune, and deploy it on their own infrastructure. Alibaba also released a \"hosted version,\" meaning the model can run on Alibaba's own servers.  Both models were made available on Monday, the eve of the Chinese New Year, and come just a week after Alibaba released a new AI model designed for robots. The company highlighted that Qwen3.5 offers improvements in performance and cost and was built with \"native multimodal capabilities,\" enabling the models to understand text, images and video simultaneously within one system.Leaning into a major AI trend this year, the model also supports new coding and agentic capabilities and is compatible with open-source AI agents like those from OpenClaw, which recently surged in popularity. AI agents are systems that can independently take actions and complete multi-step tasks on a user's behalf with minimal supervision. These agents and their abilities have garnered a lot of attention in recent weeks, after American AI company Anthropic released new agent tools. The potential for these agents to replace the work of software as a service companies, amongst others, has rocked markets. Alibaba's local competitors such as ByteDance and Zhipu AI also released upgraded models in the past week aimed at supporting more agent capabilities.Marc Einstein, research director at Counterpoint Research, told CNBC that artificial intelligence companies are preparing for the possibility that AI agents could \"upend traditional Internet business models.\"\"If this happens the consequences for those who are not prepared will be severe and [Chinese AI companies] are aware of this,\" he said. Alibaba said that its new Qwen3.5 open-weight model comes with 397 billion parameters — variables that shape how an AI system learns and reasons. While less than its previous flagship model, the company said the latest model showed significant improvement based on self-reported benchmark evaluations.Alibaba provided benchmark tests showing that Qwen3.5's performance was on par with leading models from OpenAI, Anthropic and Google DeepMind, though the comparisons were self-reported. Meanwhile, it also released a \"hosted model\" called the Qwen-3.5-Plus through its cloud platform Model Studio. Alibaba said this version also demonstrated performance on par with leading competitors. CNBC could not independently verify those claims.The new Qwen3.5 models also support 201 languages and dialects, up from the previous generation's 82. Counterpoint's Einstein said this feature reflects Alibaba's global ambitions.The company is expected to release more open-weight models during this Chinese New Year, Lin Junyang, technical lead of Alibaba Cloud's Qwen team said in a social media post.Following the release of Anthropic's latest Claude AI agent tools, other American AI giants have been accelerating the development of agentic capabilities. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said Sunday that the creator of the OpenClaw would be joining the company. Last month, Google DeepMind head Demis Hassabis told CNBC that Chinese AI models were just \"months\" behind Western rivals.watch now",

    "body": "The logo of the Adani Group is seen on the facade of its Corporate House on the outskirts of Ahmedabad, India, November 21, 2024. Amit Dave | ReutersIndia's Adani on Tuesday announced plans to invest $100 billion to develop renewable energy-powered AI-ready data centers by 2035, seeking to establish the world's largest integrated data center platform. The blockbuster investment, which comes as India pushes to gain a stronger foothold in the global AI race, is expected to create a $250 billion AI infrastructure ecosystem in India over the next decade, Adani said.The initiative is also poised to incentivize an additional $150 billion in spending across server manufacturing, sovereign cloud platforms, and supporting industries, the company said.\"The world is entering an Intelligence Revolution more profound than any previous Industrial Revolution,\" Gautam Adani, chairman of Adani Group, said in a statement. \"India will not be a mere consumer in the AI age. We will be the creators, the builders and the exporters of intelligence and we are proud to be able to participate in that future,\" he added. The announcement coincides with India's AI Impact Summit, a five-day event which got underway on Monday. Global leaders and technology executives such as OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai are expected to take part in the summit, which has been billed as the first major international AI meeting hosted in the Global South.Shares of Adani Enterprises, the flagship company of Adani Group, rose 2.3% on the news, making it one of the top gainers on the benchmark Nifty 50 stock index. Shares of Adani Green Energy were last seen up 1.8%.Strategic partnershipAdani's AI push is designed to build on AdaniConnex's existing 2 gigawatt (GW) national data center, with plans to expand toward a 5 GW target. It is this deployment that the company says will create the world's largest integrated data center platform. AdaniConnex is a joint venture between Adani Group and EdgeConnex, a global data center provider.Adani said its vision is supported by its strategic partnerships with Google. The multinational conglomerate added that it was also in talks with other major players to establish large-scale campuses across India, without providing further details.  Google's parent company Alphabet said in October that it would invest $15 billion over the next five years to build an AI data center hub in southern India.Read moreShares of Adani Group companies have been volatile in recent weeks. Indeed, the firm's stocks fell sharply after court filings late last month showed that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is looking to send a summons to Indian billionaire and Adani Group chair Gautam Adani and nephew Sagar Adani on charges of bribery and fraud.Adani's chariman was indicted with seven other men in New York federal court in November 2024 on charges related to a massive bribery and fraud scheme. CNBC reached out to Adani Group and the U.S. SEC following the news.India's Ministry of Law and Justice twice refused last year to deliver the summons to Gautam Adani and Sagar Adani under the Hague Convention, the SEC told the court. — CNBC's Priyanka Salve contributed to this report.",

(Photo by Jakub Porzycki/NurPhoto via Getty Images)Nurphoto | Nurphoto | Getty ImagesApple on Monday announced that it will bring a new integrated video podcast experience to Apple Podcasts this spring.The move comes as video viewership continues to reshape podcasting. About 37% of people over age 12 watch video podcasts monthly, according to Edison Research.The update brings Apple Podcasts more in-line with its competitors Spotify, YouTube and now Netflix, which have increasingly leaned into video podcasting.\"Twenty years ago, Apple helped take podcasting mainstream by adding podcasts to iTunes, and more than a decade ago, we introduced the dedicated Apple Podcasts app,\" said Eddy Cue, Apple's senior vice president of Services, in a statement. \"By bringing a category-leading video experience to Apple Podcasts, we're putting creators in full control of their content and how they build their businesses, while making it easier than ever for audiences to listen to or watch podcasts.\"Within the Apple Podcasts app, users will be able to switch seamlessly between watching and listening to shows from the same feed. They can also use picture-in-picture mode and download video episodes for offline viewing.While Apple Podcasts has supported video through RSS since 2005, those feeds were kept separate from audio versions of the same show. The new update introduces support for HLS, or HTTP Live Streaming, a streaming protocol developed by Apple that enables adaptive video playback and greater controls within the app.The new HLS format also introduces dynamic video ad insertion. Creators who distribute through participating hosting providers and ad networks will be able to insert video ads, including host-read spots, into episodes.Apple said it will not charge creators or hosting providers to distribute content. However, it will charge participating ad networks an impression-based fee for delivering dynamic video ads through HLS.These launch podcast hosting partners include Acast, Amazon-owned ART19, Triton's Omny Studio and SiriusXM who will all be supporting HLS video.The announcement comes as competitors continue investing in podcast video. YouTube said last year it has more than 1 billion monthly active viewers of podcast content on its platform. Spotify has also expanded its video podcast offerings and said it paid more than $100 million to podcasters in the first quarter of last year.Netflix has also entered the video podcast space. The streaming platform inked a deal with Spotify last year to bring video podcasts to Netflix and has begun investing in original video podcast programming, including \"The Pete Davidson Show,\" which launched in January.Apple does not break out revenue specifically for Apple Podcasts, but its Services segment, which includes digital content and subscription businesses, generated $30 billion in revenue in its most recent quarter.In January, the company acquired Israeli artificial intelligence startup Q.ai for an undisclosed amount. The company has not released details of the acquisition, though Q.ai's website indicated it was working on audio-focused AI tools.",

James Talarico speaks during a U.S. Senate campaign launch rally on September 09, 2025 in Round Rock, Texas.Brandon Bell | Getty ImagesStephen Colbert ripped CBS for barring him from airing on his late-night TV show an interview with Texas state Rep. James Talarico, a Democrat running for the U.S. Senate.\"You know who's not one of my guests tonight? That's Texas Representative James Talarico,\" Colbert told his show's studio audience for Monday night's broadcast of \"The Late Show with Stephen Colbert.\"\"He was supposed to be here, but we were told in no uncertain terms by our network's lawyers, who called us directly, that we could not have him on the broadcast,\" said Colbert, drawing boos from the crowd.\"Then I was told in some uncertain terms that not only could I not have him on, I could not mention me not having him on,\" Colbert said.\"And because my network clearly doesn't want us to talk about this, let's talk about this,\" Colbert said to laughs and applause.The Late Show with Stephen Colbert during Wednesday's June 25, 2025 show.Scott Kowalchyk | CBS | Getty ImagesColbert suggested that CBS's move was the result of concern that the network would draw the ire of the Federal Communications Commission.Colbert's comments are the latest escalation in tension between talk show hosts and the FCC, following the brief suspension by ABC of fellow late-night comedian Jimmy Kimmel's show last summer.The FCC last month issued guidance to the three broadcast networks, reminding them of the 1934 law that requires networks to provide equal opportunity for coverage for political candidates if their opponents appear on air. The guidance pointedly said there is no evidence that late-night and daytime talk show interviews would qualify for an exemption allowed under the law for \"bona fide\" news coverage.Colbert, during Monday's show, pointed to reports earlier this month that the FCC was investigating the ABC daytime talk show \"The View\" because of an appearance by Talarico on that program.CBS, in a statement to CNBC, said, \"The Late Show was not prohibited by CBS from broadcasting the interview with Rep. James Talarico.\"\"The show was provided legal guidance that the broadcast could trigger the FCC equal-time rule for two other candidates, including Rep. Jasmine Crockett, and presented options for how the equal time for other candidates could be fulfilled,\" CBS said.\"The Late Show decided to present the interview through its YouTube channel with on-air promotion on the broadcast rather than potentially providing the equal-time options.\"Read more CNBC politics coverageEpstein files: DOJ says it logs Congress members' searches to 'protect' victim informationEpstein files: AG Pam Bondi seemed to have Rep.

Mark Kelly over troops video, for nowWatch Pam Bondi hearing: AG touts record Dow as Democrats grill her over Trump, EpsteinTalarico on Tuesday posted a link to his interview with Colbert, which was available online.In a statement provided to CNBC by his Senate campaign, Talarico said, \"I think [President] Donald Trump is worried we're about to flip Texas. This is the party that ran against cancel culture.\"\"Now they're trying to control what we watch, what we say, and what we read,\" Talarico said. \"This is the most dangerous kind of cancel culture, the kind that comes from the top. A threat to one of our First Amendment rights is a threat to all of our First Amendment rights.\"Talarico is in a close Democratic primary for a U.S. Senate seat against Rep. Jasmine Crockett, D- Texas, in which early voting began Tuesday. The winner will face off against the winner of the Republican primary between Sen. John Cornyn and Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton. Democrats last won a statewide race in Texas in 1994.The FCC didn't immediately respond to a request for comment about whether CBS would have run afoul of agency guidance by airing Talarico's interview.FCC Commissioner Anna Gomez, in a statement, called CBS's decision \"yet another troubling example of corporate capitulation in the face of this Administration's broader campaign to censor and control speech.\"\"The FCC has no lawful authority to pressure broadcasters for political purposes or to create a climate that chills free expression,\" Gomez said. \"CBS is fully protected under the First Amendment to determine what interviews it airs, which makes its decision to yield to political pressure all the more disappointing,\" Gomez said. \"It is no secret that Paramount, CBS's parent company, has regulatory matters before the government, but corporate interests cannot justify retreating from airing newsworthy content. The FCC is powerless to impose restrictions on protected speech, and any attempt to intimidate broadcasters into self-censorship undermines both press freedom and public trust.\"\"I once again urge broadcasters and their parent companies to stand firm against these unlawful pressures and continue exercising their constitutional right to speak freely and without government interference,\" Gomez said.Paramount Skydance has launched a hostile tender bid for Warner Bros. Discovery, a deal that would require regulatory approval from the federal government if WBD shareholders accept the offer.CBS in July said Colbert's show would be cancelled in May.That announcement came shortly after Colbert blasted the network for giving what he called a \"big fat bribe\" to Trump. Paramount Skydance, earlier agreed to pay $16 million for Trump's future presidential library to settle a lawsuit over the editing of a \"60 Minutes\" interview with then-Vice President Kamala Harris.A week after CBS said it was cancelling Colbert's show, the FCC approved the $8 billion merger between Paramount and Skydance Media.Colbert, in September, spoke up for Kimmel when ABC pulled Kimmel off the air following remarks by FCC Chair Brendan Carr that the network's broadcast license was at risk because of comments Kimmel made about the alleged killer of conservative activist Charlie Kirk.Kimmel's show returned to the air about a week later.",

The exercise is designed to improve Iran's operational readiness and bolster its deterrence, among other objectives.Iran and the U.S. reached an understanding of the \"guiding principles\" during the talks, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi told reporters after they concluded, Reuters reported. The progress does not mean an agreement will be reached soon and more work still needs to be done, he added.watch nowEnergy market participants had been closely watching the outcome of the U.S.-Iran talks, particularly as both sides have increased their military presence in the region.Oil prices were last seen trading lower, erasing earlier gains. International benchmark Brent crude futures with April delivery fell 1.8% to $67.48 a barrel, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate futures with March delivery stood 0.4% lower at $62.65 Jakob Larsen, chief safety and security officer at Bimco, which represents global shipowners, said the temporary closure of the Strait of Hormuz was likely to cause \"minor nuisance and delays\" to inbound shipping headed for the Persian Gulf — but no major disruptions.\"The exercise establishes a live firing exercise area overlapping the inbound part of Strait of Hormuz's Traffic Separation Scheme, and requests that shipping keeps clear of the area for the duration of a few hours,\" Larsen said.\"Given the level of tension in the area, it is expected that commercial shipping will comply with the Iranian request to keep clear of the exercise area,\" he added.— CNBC's Lori Ann LaRocco and Lee Ying Shan contributed to this report.",

    "body": "Early renderings released by Ford Motor of its next-generation, electric pickup truck, based on its upcoming universal electric vehicle platform.Courtesy FordDETROIT — Ford Motor's $5 billion \"bet\" on its next generation of all-electric vehicles will feature a budding technology that Tesla commercialized in the U.S. on its Cybertruck, the Detroit automaker said Tuesday.The system, known as a 48-volt electrical architecture, had been discussed in the automotive industry for decades but Tesla was the first to bring it to consumers in 2023.The auto industry has historically used a 12-volt system with a lead-acid battery for all vehicles to power the car's accessories — but that's been problematic and caused recalls for many EVs. The new architecture instead uses the EV's high-voltage battery to power everything.The 48-volt system improves efficiency, allows for additional electrical bandwidth and saves weight through the reduction of wiring, officials have said. The power also can be \"stepped down\" to 12 volts, when needed, through the use of new electronic control units, or ECUs, that handle different groups of an EV's architecture.The new electrical system is one of many innovations that Ford believes will allow its next-generation EVs — starting with a $30,000 small electric pickup truck in 2027 — to compete against Tesla as well as rapidly expanding Chinese brands in global markets.\"At Ford, we took on the challenge many others have stopped doing. We're taking the fight to our competition, including the Chinese,\" Ford CEO Jim Farley said during an August event at a plant in Kentucky that will produce the unnamed electric pickup. \"For too long, legacy automakers played it safe.\"Read moreFarley has called it a \"Model T moment\" for the company, referring to the company's flagship vehicle that came out more than a century ago and led to the mass adoption of vehicles during the early 1900s. He's also called it a \"bet\" for Ford given the amount of changes it will make to the EVs as well as the company and its processes. Ford expects the new EVs, which will be based on a common \"Universal Electric Vehicle,\" or UEV, to have comparable costs to gas-powered vehicles through new technologies and efficiencies. Currently, the massive batteries that power EVs have made them far more expensive to produce and have been infamously unprofitable. The Detroit automaker has said the new EVs will reduce parts by 20% versus a typical vehicle, with 25% fewer fasteners, 40% fewer workstations dock-to-dock in the plant and 15% faster assembly time.\"It represents the most radical change on how we design and how we build vehicles at Ford since the Model T,\" Farley said at the plant. \"Now is time to change the game once again.\"Ford CEO Jim Farley speaks at the Louisville Assembly Plant as the company shares its plans to design and assemble breakthrough electric vehicles in the United States, Aug. 11, 2025.Courtesy: FordFord said those improvements, as well as price points that are more similar to gas-powered models, will lead to greater adoption of EVs. That's despite a significant slowdown in U.S. EV sales amid changes to federal support by the Trump administration as well as less-than-expected consumer adoption.U.S. EV sales peaked in September, ahead of the federal incentives ending, at 10.3% of the new vehicle market, according to Cox Automotive. That demand plummeted to preliminary estimates of 5.8% during the fourth quarter.Those market conditions recently led Ford to announce $19.5 billion in write-downs, largely related to a pullback in EV plans, but the company said it will continue to invest $5 billion for its new UEV platform through 2027.\"Our focus has been on giving them everything they would get in a nice vehicle and more, and we think that that will allow us to ultimately not just make an affordable vehicle, but make one that's extremely desirable,\" Alan Clarke, Ford's executive director of advanced EV development, said during a media briefing.48-volt systemThe 48-volt system provides significant benefits to other parts of the vehicle aside from just the battery and is expected to continue to do so as the bandwidth of 12-volt batteries gets maxed out, according Clarke, a former Tesla executive. \"It's less expensive, has smaller wires and is the future of automotive,\" he said. \"So, if you want to future-protect this platform to exist for more than a decade … it's very clear that 48 made the most sense.\"Alan Clarke, Ford’s executive director of advanced EV development, during a video presentation on Ford's Universal Electric Vehicle platform.Courtesy FordFord said the wiring harness in the new midsize truck will be more than 4,000 feet shorter and 22 pounds lighter than the wiring harness used in Ford's first-generation electric SUV.Tesla CEO Elon Musk sent competitors such as Ford and General Motors a \"how-to\" guide on developing a 48-volt system in 2023.Clarke said Ford had already decided on a 48-volt platform before getting the letter but that it \"certainly added fuel to the fire\" and was a \"helpful starting point to see how they thought about\" it. It also helped suppliers get ready to assist with 48-volt systems, he added.GigacastingsIn addition to the 48-volt system, the company on Tuesday released additional details on how it's achieving its targets with the new EV through aerodynamics, team \"bounties\" to increase vehicle efficiency and turning to Tesla-pioneered \"gigacastings.\"Gigacasting is a manufacturing process that can replace dozens of traditionally small, stamped parts with larger pieces. The process requires massive machines to pressurize large sheets of metal into parts such as a vehicle's facia or underlying structure.A Ford F-150 Lightning next to a Tesla Cybertruck.Michael Wayland / CNBCFord said the new pickup will only have two structural front and rear parts compared with 146 such components on its current gas-powered Maverick small pickup.Ford also said its aluminum castings for the upcoming EV are more than 27% lighter than those features on a Tesla Model Y.\"We're still on a really steep decline of EV costs, and you can only get that by innovating, and you can only get that by system level, optimizing into what eventually becomes a product that a customer wants,\" Clarke said.

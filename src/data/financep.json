    "body": "watch nowDespite worries over bad loans at midsize U.S. banks, there's little evidence of a systemic problem, according to a senior analyst at Moody's Ratings.Marc Pinto, the agency's head of global private credit, acknowledged in a interview on CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" that there are concerns over loose lending standards and some slack in the conditions that institutions attach to loans.However, he said when looking at the system as a whole, contagion the likes that could trigger a broader financial crisis is not evident.\"When we dig deeper here and look to see if there's a turn in the credit cycle, which is effectively what the market seems to be focusing on, we can find no evidence,\" Pinto said. \"Now that's what we're seeing today. That could always change. But if we look at the asset quality numbers that we've seen over the last several quarters, we're seeing very little deterioration at all.\"Bank stocks sold off aggressively across the board Thursday after Zions and Bancorp and Western Alliance Bancorp disclosed holding bad loans related to the bankruptcies of two auto lenders. The worries have dragged down shares of investment bank Jefferies this month since it disclosed some exposure to bankrupt auto parts maker First Brands.Losses swept across the sector Thursday as worries grew that the danger could be more widespread. JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon raised some eyebrows earlier this week when he said on the bank's earnings conference call that \"when you see one cockroach, there are probably more.\"\"One cockroach does not a trend make,\" Pinto said.In fact, Pinto said default rates on high-yield debt this year have been relatively low, holding under 5%, and are expected to drift down to below 3% in 2026. By comparison, during the 2008 financial crisis, defaults in high-yield debt were in low double digits.At the same time, the U.S. economy has proven stronger than thought, Pinto added, despite persistent worries about labor market weakness and the impact that President Donald Trump's tariffs might have on inflation and consumer demand.Pinto said he is at a conference this week with about 2,000 bankers \"and one of the words that I keep hearing is resilience.\"\"With respect to GDP growth, we're doing much better than many people thought just six months ago,\" he said. \"So again, the credit conditions, looking at GDP growth as well as an expected decline in interest rates, we feel the credit quality is in a pretty good place today and potentially may improve.\"Market sentiment appeared to improve Friday after a sell-off Thursday.The SPDR S&P Regional Banking exchange-traded fund, which tracks the mid-market leaders, tumbled 6.2% Thursday but rose 2% in premarket trading Friday.",

    "body": "watch nowThe U.S. Army Corps of Engineers will immediately pause, and consider canceling, over $11 billion in projects due to the government shutdown, Trump administration budget chief Russell Vought said Friday.\"The Democrat shutdown has drained the Army Corps of Engineers' ability to manage billions of dollars in projects,\" Vought, the director of the White House Office of Management and Budget, said in an X post.The paused funds pertain to \"lower-priority projects\" in cities including New York, San Francisco, Boston and Baltimore, Vought said.The Army Corps of Engineers, which provides a wide range of public engineering services and comprises more than 37,000 civilians and soldiers, did not immediately respond to CNBC's requests for comment on Vought's post.Vought, a co-author of the right-wing manual for major government overhaul known as Project 2025, has been the first to announce federal layoffs and funding pauses that the Trump administration says are consequences of the shutdown.President Donald Trump and Vought have also described the congressional funding lapse as an \"opportunity\" to slash the federal bureaucracy. Trump has repeatedly said that only Democrats' priorities are being targeted.On the day the shutdown began, Vought announced that the administration was freezing about $18 billion for two major infrastructure projects in New York City and canceling roughly $8 billion more for climate-related projects in Democratic-leaning states.Two days later, Vought said the administration froze another $2.1 billion in Department of Transportation funding earmarked for the Chicago transit system.The White House has also insisted that the shutdown will cause thousands of federal workers to be laid off. The administration said last week that more than 4,000 reduction-in-force notices had been issued; on Wednesday, Vought said the total job cuts would likely end up being \"north of 10,000.\"But a federal judge on Wednesday afternoon temporarily blocked the administration from firing government workers.",

And in New York, you pay $1,300 for the same thing,\" Trump said during a Thursday afternoon event about in vitro fertilization at the White House. \"Instead of $1,300 you'll be paying about $150 and they'll be paying $150 so we're going to pay the same thing.\"Asked by a reporter what drug he was referring to, Trump replied, \"I was referring to Ozempic or ... the fat loss drug.\"At that point, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Administrator Dr. Mehmet Oz interjected and stressed that the administration has not yet agreed to GLP-1 price reductions with drugmakers.\"We have not negotiated those yet ... We're going to be rolling these out over time, the GLP category of drugs, which includes Ozempic have not been negotiated yet,\" Oz said.Just a week ago, Oz had said that the administration was \"in the middle of a lot of action\" with price discussions with weight loss drugmakers.watch nowEli Lilly shares closed 2% lower Friday, while Novo Nordisk's stock fell 3% in U.S. trading. Meanwhile, shares of Hims & Hers Health — which sells much cheaper compounded GLP-1s — plunged more than 15%.Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk were among 17 of the largest U.S. pharmaceutical companies that received letters from the Trump administration following the president's executive order on so-called most-favored nation pricing, demanding that businesses bring U.S. drug prices in line with those in other developed nations.Pfizer and AstraZeneca have signed on to the president's initiative, striking drug pricing deals with the administration. But Trump and Oz's comments make it clear the administration is looking to get the weight loss drugmakers on board.$150 GLP-1 would be cheaper than compoundersWhile demand for weight loss drugs has grown, price has remained an obstacle for consumers and employers.Only about one in five large employers currently offer GLP-1s for weight loss, according to a new survey from the Kaiser Family Foundation. Of those who do, two-thirds say the high cost drugs have had a \"significant\" impact on their prescription drug spending.Workers who don't get coverage through health insurance have increasingly turned to the cash market to buy the drugs on their own.Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk sell discounted versions of their diabetes and weight loss medications on their direct-to-consumer sites at roughly $500 a month. Telehealth providers like Hims & Hers offer compounded versions of GLP-1s for less than half that price, anywhere between $130 to $200 per month.If the administration could bring the cash price for popular weight loss drugs like Lilly's Zepbound and Novo Nordisk's Wegovy down to $150, that would be competitive with compounded options and could have a major impact on the current cash market.",

    "body": "George Santos, who was expelled from the U.S. House of Representatives, arrives for the sentencing in his criminal corruption charges at Central Islip Federal Courthouse in Central Islip, New York, U.S., April 25, 2025.Shannon Stapleton | ReutersPresident Donald Trump on Friday evening said he has commuted the prison sentence of George Santos, releasing the disgraced former Republican congressman immediately.Santos \"was somewhat of a 'rogue,' but there are many rogues throughout our Country that aren't forced to serve seven years in prison,\" Trump wrote in a Truth Social post.Santos was sentenced to 87 months in federal prison this year after pleading guilty to committing wire fraud and aggravated identity theft. He began serving his sentence in late July.The 37-year-old New York representative served in the House for less than a year before he was expelled from Congress under a cloud of scandal in December 2023.Even before he was sworn in, Santos admitted lying about key details of his life on the campaign trail. While in Congress, he was charged by the Department of Justice with an array of federal crimes including fraud, theft, money laundering and making false statements.Trump's decision to commute Santos' sentence came after multiple friends and allies of the imprisoned ex-politician made appeals for his clemency, a senior White House official told NBC News on Friday evening.Trump had also recently read Santos' writings from prison describing his living conditions, the official told NBC.In a flattery-filled letter published Monday in local Long Island news outlet The South Shore Press, Santos directly asked Trump for clemency.\"You have always been a man of second chances, a leader who believes in redemption and renewal,\" Santos wrote. \"I am asking you now, from the depths of my heart, to extend that same belief to me.\"Read more CNBC politics coverageIllinois Gov.

Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., who weathered heavy criticism during his 2010 Senate campaign for saying he had \"served in Vietnam\" when he had never been deployed there.Trump had said earlier in October that Blumenthal \"should be investigated, and Justice should be sought.\" The attack came hours after Attorney General Pam Bondi, in a combative and politically charged Senate hearing, directly accused Blumenthal of lying about his military record.Blumenthal said in 2010 that he had misspoken about his service on multiple occasions. On CNN last week, the senator said Trump's accusations are \"completely deceptive and distorted.\"Trump did not serve in the military.Trump wrote Friday that Blumenthal's record \"is far worse than what George Santos did, and at least Santos had the Courage, Conviction, and Intelligence to ALWAYS VOTE REPUBLICAN!\"\"George has been in solitary confinement for long stretches of time and, by all accounts, has been horribly mistreated,\" Trump wrote.\"Therefore, I just signed a Commutation, releasing George Santos from prison, IMMEDIATELY. Good luck George, have a great life!\"",

    "body": "watch nowBig banks including JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs had just finished taking victory laps after a blockbuster quarter when concerns emerged from an obscure corner of Wall Street, sending a collective shiver through global finance.Regional bank Zions late Wednesday disclosed a near total wipeout on $60 million in loans after finding \"apparent misrepresentations\" from the borrowers. The next day, peer Western Alliance said that it had sued the same borrower, a commercial real estate firm called the Cantor Group, for alleged fraud.The result was a sudden and deep selloff among regional banks, drawing comparisons to the churn of the 2023 banking crisis that consumed Silicon Valley Bank and First Republic. This time around, investors are focused on a specific type of lending made by banks to non-depository financial institutions, or NDFIs, as the source of possible contagion.\"When you see one cockroach, there are probably more,\" JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon said this week. \"Everyone should be forewarned on this one.\"Concerns over credit quality had been simmering for weeks after the September collapse of two U.S. auto-related companies. JPMorgan, the biggest U.S. bank by assets, this week reported a $170 million loss tied to one of them, the subprime auto lender Tricolor.But it wasn't until a third case of alleged fraud around loans made to NDFIs that investors were jolted into fearing the worst, according to Truist banking analyst Brian Foran.\"You now have had three situations where there was alleged fraud\" involving NDFIs, Foran said.Dimon's comments \"really resonated with people who were like, 'Oh, man, the tide went out a little bit, and now we're seeing who was lacking their swim trunks,\" Foran said.watch nowWhat are NDFIs?The episode cast a spotlight on a fast-growing category of loans made by regional banks and global investment banks alike. Rules put into place after the 2008 financial crisis discouraged regulated banks from making many types of loans, from mortgages to subprime auto, leading to the rise of thousands of non-bank lenders.Moving riskier activities outside of the regulated bank perimeter, where failures are backstopped by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, seemed like a good move.But it turns out, banks are a major source of funding for non-bank lenders: commercial loans to NDFIs reached $1.14 trillion as of March, per the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.Bank loans made to non-bank financial firms were the single fastest-growing category, rising 26% annually since 2012, according to the St. Louis Fed.\"The surge in NDFI lending was really because all these different regulations added up to say there are a bunch of loans banks can't do anymore, but if they lend to someone else who does them, that's OK,\" Foran said.\"We really don't know much about these NDFI books,\" Foran said. \"People are saying, 'I didn't know it was so easy for a bank to think they had $50 million in collateral and find out they had zero.'\"'Overreaction' or early?Part of what's spooking investors is that, while some of the loan losses disclosed have been relatively small, they've been near total wipeouts, said KBW bank analyst Catherine Mealor.\"NDFI lending, because of the collateral involved, typically has a higher loss rate, and the losses can come very quickly and out of nowhere,\" Mealor said. \"It's really hard to wrap your mind around these risks.\"Mealor said investors have been inundating her with questions around the level of NDFI exposures in her coverage universe, the analyst said. Firms including Western Alliance and Axos Financial are among those with the highest proportion of NDFI loans, according to an August research note from Janney Montgomery.Still, regional banks are benefitting from an improving interest rate environment and rising mergers activity, which underpin valuations, Mealor said, adding she thinks this week's stock selloff was an \"overreaction.\"\"You want to avoid companies that show up high in the screen for NDFI loans,\" she said. \"There are plenty of high-quality companies in the KRX that are trading at a massive discount.\"Correction: This article has been updated to remove an incorrect mention of losses at one of the regional banks tied to the alleged loan fraud.

I hadn't heard that.\"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said he was \"not happy\" with the idea following Trump's response.Kirill Dmitriev, an investment envoy for Russian President Vladimir Putin, suggested in posts on Musk's social media platform X that the project would be partly funded by Moscow.Dmitriev said it would be \"a 70-mile link symbolizing unity.\"A tunnel like this would traditionally cost an estimated $65 billion to build, said Dmitriev, who is head of Russia's sovereign wealth fund, adding that The Boring Company and its technology could potentially reduce those costs to $8 billion and complete the project within eight years.\"Let's build a future together!\" he wrote.Read more CNBC tech newsBenioff's backing of Trump, troops in SF leads Salesforce Foundation director Conway to quitRay-Ban maker EssilorLuxottica says Meta smart glasses are boosting growthChinese robotaxi company Pony.ai to work with Stellantis on Europe expansionSpotify moves further into AI music with Sony, Universal, Warner partnershipDmitriev's suggestion followed a call between Putin and Trump on Thursday, during which plans were made to discuss possible resolutions to the Ukraine War.Trump said Secretary of State Marco Rubio and other high-level advisors will meet next week with a Russian delegation before Trump and Putin meet in Budapest, Hungary, at a future date.Musk did not respond to a request for comment about the proposal.Construction of an undersea tunnel in the Bering Strait would require Musk's Boring Company to work through below-freezing temperatures in a region without existing infrastructure and with deep and frequent earthquakes.The Boring Company has no track record of working through such conditions.Its previous tunneling efforts were completed in hot, dry locations with plenty of infrastructure and services nearby.The Boring Company was recently fined and cited by environmental regulators in the state of Nevada for an \"extraordinary number of violations,\" ProPublica reported, citing public records. Those violations included: digging without approval, releasing untreated water onto city streets and spilling waste from trucks.The Boring Company is now working on a 10-mile tunnel project from downtown Nashville, Tennessee, to its airport, dubbed the Music City Loop.

    "body": "WASHINGTON, DC - OCTOBER 16: U.S. Senate Minority Leader Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-NY) (R) and House Minority Leader Rep. Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY) (L) brief members of the press during a news conference on the government shutdown at the U.S. Capitol on October 16, 2025 in Washington, DC. Alex Wong | Getty ImagesCapitol Hill remains locked in a stalemate as the government shutdown trudges into its third week — and Democrats say their lack of trust in President Donald Trump is a major obstacle to negotiations.In past legislative disputes, bipartisan coalitions known as \"gangs\" have formed to break the logjams. The groups have helped lay the early framework for major deals before getting buy-in from leadership and other lawmakers.In the current funding lapse — which is already longer than most previous government shutdowns — those gangs are nowhere to be found.\"What good is an agreement by a gang of four or eight or 12, when the president of the United States regards himself as his own law and disregards the norms and rules?\" Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., told CNBC.There have been some bipartisan talks around Democrats' key demand: an extension of enhanced premium tax credits for Affordable Care Act health insurance premiums, which are set to expire at year's end.But no specific group has convened to hash out those details, or more broadly negotiate an end to the shutdown.Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., who supports extending the tax credits, said he's had conversations with multiple Democratic senators, but no set group has formed.Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., holds up the continuing resolution to fund the government during a news conference with Speaker of the House Mike Johnson, R-La., on the shutdown in the U.S. Capitol on Friday, Oct. 10, 2025. Tom Williams | CQ-Roll Call, Inc. | Getty Images\"What's different about this is I don't sense any coalescing,\" Hawley said. \"There doesn't seem to be any sort of momentum around people saying, like, 'OK, really, we need to make a deal.'\"Trump, Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., and Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., have maintained that no negotiations can happen until the government has reopened. They need support from around eight Senate Democrats to pass a stopgap bill that will temporarily resume federal funding at current levels.Thune told MSNBC on Wednesday that he has offered Democratic leaders a vote on extending the Obamacare subsidies in exchange for opening the government.But Democrats have expressed strong doubts about any handshake deal with Republicans.\"We need an ironclad path forward that decisively addresses the Republican health-care crisis.\" House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., said Thursday on MSNBC's \"Morning Joe.\"\"They can't be trusted on a wing and a prayer,\" Jeffries said.Read more CNBC government shutdown coverageBill to fund military during government shutdown fails in Senate procedural voteGovernment shutdown: Senate bill fails for 10th time, Kelly tells Trump to get involvedJudge blocks Trump from firing federal workers during government shutdown for nowKristi Noem's shutdown airport video may violate Hatch Act, Sen.

A bipartisan immigration reform proposal introduced last year, for instance, collapsed after Trump publicly opposed it.Some Democrats are now calling on Trump to participate in negotiations himself.\"They seem to follow his lead on everything,\" Sen. Mark Kelly, D-Ariz., said of his GOP colleagues on CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" on Thursday.\"That's the way this ends,\" Kelly said.Further eroding trust is the Trump administration's willingness to cancel billions of dollars in funding approved by a bipartisan group of lawmakers, Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., told reporters.\"There's been a loss of trust between Senate Democrats and the Administration and the House because of what's happened over the last six to nine months in terms of respecting bipartisan spending bills that were signed into law last year,\" Coons said.Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, accused Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., of avoiding negotiations in order to appease progressives in his party, who excoriated him after he previously voted to fund the government in March.\"I think he's afraid to reach some sort of deal like we typically do in these circumstances, because he'll be attacked by his progressive, radical base,\" Cornyn said of Schumer.Schumer was part of the \"Gang of Eight\" that helped pass a bipartisan immigration reform bill in the Senate in 2013.Hawley said Democrats were comfortable keeping the standoff going.\"I just think that folks seem to be pretty content, particularly Democrats, with leaving the government shut down,\" he said.Democrats have a reason to feel secure, at least for now: multiple polls show more Americans are blaming Republicans for the shutdown.The latest CNBC All-America Economic Survey found that 53% of respondents would blame Trump, congressional Republicans or both if the shutdown caused significant economic harm, versus 37% who would blame Democrats.The survey, which polled 1,000 adults nationwide from Oct. 8-12, carries a margin of error of plus or minus 3.1%.",

    "body": "Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff apologized on Friday for making comments in support of President Donald Trump potentially sending federal troops to San Francisco, where his company is based. \"Having listened closely to my fellow San Franciscans and our local officials, and after the largest and safest Dreamforce in our history, I do not believe the National Guard is needed to address safety in San Francisco,\" Benioff wrote in a post on X.The Trump administration recently deployed the National Guard to Portland, Oregon and Chicago, sparking protests and lawsuits and resulting in citizens and immigrants being detained without legal representation.In a story published late last week in The New York Times, Benioff indicated that he would welcome troops to San Francisco. The company's annual Dreamforce conference was held in downtown San Francisco from Tuesday through Thursday of this week.\"We don't have enough cops, so if they can be cops, I'm all for it,\" Benioff told the Times.Benioff faced blowback for his comments from local politicians and other leaders. California Governor Gavin Newsom and San Francisco politicians on Wednesday issued statements and held press conferences to deliver the message that federal troops are not welcome in the city, and that crime is coming down.Prominent startup investor Ron Conway, who backed companies including Google, Airbnb and Stripe, resigned from the board of the Salesforce Foundation on Thursday. According to the New York Times, Conway told Benioff in an email that their \"values were no longer aligned.\" Conway is a longtime Democratic donor who was a member of VCs for Kamala, and donated around $500,000 to at least two funds tied to Kamala Harris' unsuccessful 2024 election campaign. While Benioff has donated to members of both parties, he has supported Democrats for president, including Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton and Kamala Harris.Venture capitalist David Sacks, who is now Trump's AI and crypto czar, said after the news about Conway that Benioff could join the Republicans. On Tuesday, Sacks, a longtime friend and associate of Elon Musk, was featured with Benioff in an onstage interview at Dreamforce. \"Dear Marc @Benioff, if the Democrats don't want you, we would be happy for you to join our team,\" Sacks wrote on X. \"Cancel culture is over, and we are the inclusive party.\"Following Benioff's initial comment to the Times, Benioff appeared to walk back his comments, writing on X that safety is \"first and foremost, the responsibility of our city and state leaders.\" However, by that point,  Musk and other right-wing figures had seized on his original comments, amplifying them to their audiences.Musk, who has drawn criticism for his personal drug use, characterized downtown San Francisco as a \"drug zombie apocalypse.\" And on Wednesday, Trump called San Francisco \"a mess,\" and suggested possibly sending in the National Guard.\"My earlier comment came from an abundance of caution around the event, and I sincerely apologize for the concern it caused,\" Benioff wrote in his Friday post. \"It's my firm belief that our city makes the most progress when we all work together in a spirit of partnership.\"Opposition to Benioff's initial suggestion also came from Garry Tan, CEO of startup incubator Y Combinator. He wrote on X that \"We don't need the National Guard,\" but he used his post to go after liberal local officials and judges perceived as too lenient.— CNBC's Lora Kolodny contributed to this report.

    "body": "Elon Musk, CEO of SpaceX and Tesla, attends the Viva Technology conference at the Porte de Versailles exhibition center in Paris on June 16, 2023.Gonzalo Fuentes | ReutersTop proxy advisor Institutional Shareholder Services is recommending that Tesla investors vote against a pay plan for CEO Elon Musk that would grant him nearly $1 trillion more in stock.The \"mega performance equity award\" to Musk, designed to retain the CEO long-term, \"has an astronomical grant value conditioned upon far-reaching performance targets that, if achieved, would create enormous value for shareholders,\" ISS wrote on Friday.Tesla's 2025 annual shareholder meeting and proxy vote is scheduled for Nov. 5. The company is scheduled to report third-quarter results on Wednesday. ISS said that while some shareholders may support the pay plan, \"there are unmitigated concerns surrounding the special award's magnitude and design.\"Musk's plan, if approved, would be the largest ever awarded to a public company CEO. It could could net Musk up to an additional 12% stake in Tesla, should the company hit a market cap of $8.5 trillion and achieve other goals.Tesla disagreed with the ISS recommendations.In a post on X, which is owned by Musk, the automaker accused ISS of missing \"fundamental points of investing and governance,\" and complained that the advisors had previously \"recommended against compensation that shareholders have voted on twice before (and that Elon has already earned), as well as the 2025 CEO Performance Award (where Elon receives nothing unless shareholders win big).\"The company urged shareholders to vote with the board's recommendations on all proposals on the 2025 proxy.ISS previously advised investors to reject a \"ratification\" of Musk's 2018 CEO pay package, which was worth an estimated $56 billion at the time.The Delaware Court of Chancery ruled early last year that the 2018 pay plan had been improperly granted by the Tesla board and must be rescinded. The ruling said Tesla hid crucial details from shareholders that they were entitled to before voting, and that Musk had controlled the board.Musk has appealed that court's decision to the Delaware State Supreme Court, with opening arguments in the appeal heard by a panel of judges this week.Representatives for ISS declined to comment beyond the report.ISS, along with Glass Lewis and smaller peers, can influence how shareholders decide to cast their votes at annual elections. Musk accused ISS and Glass Lewis in 2023 of effectively controlling the stock market because of their influence with passive or index funds in some matters. He also baselessly compared ISS to a terrorist organization.Musk will be able to vote his own shares in the vote concerning his future pay. He holds at least 13.5% of Tesla's voting power, according to the most recent available disclosures on his stake. Those holdings alone could be enough to secure approval for the nearly $1 trillion pay package.In September, Musk added to his ownership of Tesla stock buying another $1 billion worth of shares.Among other ISS recommendations, the firm also suggested that shareholders should vote against giving Tesla's board authorization to invest in xAI, the AI company that Musk started in March 2023 but only disclosed publicly in July that year. Tesla has sold tens of millions of dollars worth of its Megapack battery energy storage systems to xAI.ISS also recommended against voting to reinstate Tesla board member Ira Ehrenpreis, a longstanding and close friend of Musk.In May, Tesla changed its corporate bylaws to limit shareholders' ability to sue for a breach of fiduciary duties so that only a shareholder that owns at least 3% of the company's stock can bring what's called a \"derivative\" action. Ehrenpreis presided over Tesla's governance committee at the time that change was made without a shareholder vote.WATCH: Former Tesla board member says it's hard to argue with valuationwatch now",

    "body": "As the global market for secondhand luxury items surges, authentication has become the defining factor separating credible platforms from the rest.The resale market for fashion and luxury items is expanding at an annual rate of 10%, three times faster than the firsthand market, according to a report released Oct. 9 by Boston Consulting Group and luxury resale platform Vestiaire Collective.The report projects the global resale market could reach up to $360 billion by 2030, from about $210 billion today.With more shoppers buying pre-owned designer brands, trust has become paramount. \"As counterfeit manufacturing becomes increasingly sophisticated, even luxury brands themselves sometimes fail to detect fakes, in some cases, unknowingly repairing counterfeit items,\" said Jaewha Choi, CEO of South Korean online marketplace Bunjang.Horror stories abound online of people paying thousands for fake Hermès bags or a Rolex Oyster Perpetual watches with swapped parts. Some counterfeits are so convincing they are dubbed \"superfakes,\" reportedly made with materials from the same leather suppliers as the original brands.Buyer bewareHowever, as the resale market expands, authentication has become a growing concern. The secondhand industry has long operated under the rule of \"caveat emptor,\" or buyer beware.To counter increasingly realistic \"superfakes,\" resale platforms are pouring resources into verification. Singapore-based online marketplace Carousell opened its first brick-and-mortar store for luxury items in downtown Singapore this year, allowing sellers to have their items graded by one of the company's appraisers before listing them for resale.The verification team inspects not only the material of a bag but also details like stitching and stamping, Tresor Tan, Director of Sales, Marketing and Client Relations at Carousell Luxury, told CNBC.\"At the end of the day, it's our reputation at stake as well,\" Tan said. \"And because of that confidence, we also offer our buyers a money-back guarantee on authenticity.\"watch nowThe company has built a proprietary database covering almost 500 product styles, and higher-valued items go through multiple checks. In cases where the authenticity is in doubt, the items will not be listed, Tan said.South Korea's Bunjang has also followed in the same vein, developing its own proprietary authentication system that combines traditional visual inspections with scientific equipment and artificial intelligence \"trained on hundreds of thousands of data points,\" Choi told CNBC.Bunjang claims a 99.9% authentication accuracy rate in identifying genuine goods, and its verification system can continuously learn and adapt to counterfeiting methods by leveraging AI.Trust fuels salesBoth Carousell and Bunjang said verification has boosted business.Bunjang said luxury goods now make up more than a quarter of its platform's $1.1 billion in annual gross merchandise value. Transactions and total value for luxury goods rose 30% year on year in the first half of 2025, Choi said.Carousell's Tan did not disclose specific figures but said the luxury segment has seen \"very strong interest\" and has recorded \"great growth.\"This growth that began with Carousell's 2012 launch as an online platform eventually led to the opening of its first physical store.\"When someone is buying and selling a $100,000 watch on the platform, it definitely catches our attention,\" she said, saying that users wanted Carousell's oversight in high-value transactions.Along with its verification process, the store also offers a money-back guarantee for its products. Tan said that while prices may not always be the lowest in the market, the store aims to offer \"fair value.\"\"We may be, say, $200 more expensive than what someone else is offering, but [consumers] will still ultimately weigh the different options for $200 savings,\" she said. \"Am I better off with a bit of assurance?\"Next wave of luxury consumersAffordability is the top reason for buying secondhand luxury items, cited by 80% of respondents, according to BCG's report.But it's not just about saving money. Shoppers are increasingly drawn to rare or discontinued collections that are no longer available in stores, Samantha Virk, Chief Marketing Officer and U.S. CEO of Vestiaire Collective, told CNBC.\"These motivations are getting stronger across the board as compared to surveys in previous years, showing that secondhand shopping is becoming a deeply ingrained part of how people engage with fashion today,\" Virk said.watch nowYounger shoppers, with their limited spending power, prefer to buy, enjoy and quickly resell items, Bunjang's Choi said.\"This remarkable growth reflects a fundamental shift in how Millennials and Gen Z, the next wave of luxury consumers, perceive and engage with luxury goods.\"",

    "body": "Ron Conway, founder of SV Angel, speaks during the TechCrunch Disrupt NYC 2015 conference in New York on May 4, 2015.Michael Nagle | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesDays after suggesting that President Donald Trump should send federal troops to San Francisco, Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff is facing some consequences.Prominent startup investor Ron Conway, who backed companies including Google, Airbnb and Stripe, resigned from the board of the Salesforce Foundation on Thursday, CNBC has confirmed. Conway is a longtime Democratic donor who was a member of VCs for Kamala, and donated around $500,000 to at least two funds tied to Kamala Harris' unsuccessful 2024 election campaign.The New York Times was first to report on Conway's departure from the Salesforce Foundation. A Salesforce spokesperson confirmed his exit in an emailed statement.\"We have deep gratitude for Ron Conway and his incredible contributions to the Salesforce Foundation Board for over a decade,\" the spokesperson said, noting that the group has donated, \"$250 million to public schools and education nonprofits to advance opportunity and access for young people, including $30 million announced this week.\"The Trump administration recently deployed the National Guard to Portland, Oregon and Chicago, sparking protests and lawsuits and resulting in citizens and immigrants being detained without legal representation.In a story published late last week in The New York Times, Benioff indicated that he would welcome troops to San Francisco, home to Salesforce. The company's annual Dreamforce conference began in downtown San Francisco on Tuesday.\"We don't have enough cops, so if they can be cops, I'm all for it,\" Benioff told the Times.Benioff later appeared to walk back his comments, writing on X that safety is \"first and foremost, the responsibility of our city and state leaders.\" However, by that point, Tesla CEO Elon Musk and other right-wing figures had seized on his original comments, amplifying them to their audiences.Musk, who has drawn criticism for his personal drug use, characterized downtown San Francisco as a \"drug zombie apocalypse.\" And on Wednesday, Trump called San Francisco \"a mess,\" and suggested possibly sending in the National Guard.According to the Times, Conway told Benioff in an email that their \"values were no longer aligned.\" While Benioff has donated to members of both parties, he has supported Democrats for president, including Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton and Kamala Harris.Conway is founder and managing partner of SV Angel, an early-stage venture firm. He has long been an advocate for tech in San Francisco, having founded trade organization sf.citi and helping start FWD.us, which focused on immigration reform.The Salesforce Foundation isn't his only connection to Benioff's philanthropic efforts. Conway is also a large donor to the UCSF Benioff Children's Hospital.Conway didn't respond to a request for comment.California Governor Gavin Newsom and San Francisco leaders on Wednesday issued statements and held press conferences to deliver the message that federal troops are not welcome in the city, and that crime is coming down.Conway has supported Newsom, including in 2021, when he opposed a recall effort against the Democratic governor.WATCH: Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff sits down with Jim Cramer at Dreamforce 2025watch now",

    "body": "watch nowOracle's extended rally, which has been driven by the company's increasingly central position in the artificial intelligence boom, hit pause on Friday, with the stock tumbling 7%, its worst day since January.The slide came a day after the software company revealed a long-term outlook, boosted by AI, at an analysts' meeting that was part of the Oracle AI World conference in Las Vegas.Oracle said on Thursday that it expects $166 billion in cloud infrastructure revenue in the 2030 fiscal year, up from $18 billion in fiscal 2026. The company now sees $21 in adjusted earnings per share on $225 billion in total revenue in fiscal 2030, which represents annualized sales growth of over 31%.The initial reaction was positive. Oracle shares rose 3.1% on Thursday, continuing a rally that's boosted the company's market cap by more than 160% in two years.But a hint of skepticism emerged on Friday, with some analysts questioning Oracle's ability to reach its lofty targets.\"It feels like the stock may take a bit of a breather here as investors digest those numbers and try to get comfort around the achievability of long-term numbers,\" Rishi Jaluria, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets, told CNBC's Seema Mody in an email. Jaluria recommends holding the stock.Oracle didn't respond to a request for comment.Read more CNBC tech newsBenioff's backing of Trump, troops in SF leads Salesforce Foundation director Conway to quitRay-Ban maker EssilorLuxottica says Meta smart glasses are boosting growthChinese robotaxi company Pony.ai to work with Stellantis on Europe expansionSpotify moves further into AI music with Sony, Universal, Warner partnershipOracle has emerged as one of the biggest beneficiaries of the AI infrastructure boom. It recently announced a five-year deal with OpenAI, worth more than $300 billion, to provide access to AI chips. Following its earnings report in September, the stock had its best day since 1992 as the company said it had $455 billion in remaining performance obligations, up 359% from a year earlier.On Thursday, Oracle confirmed that it had a cloud deal with Meta, and said it signed up $65 billion in cloud infrastructure commitments in the current quarter. Oracle also said that its adjusted gross margins on AI infrastructure would be between 30% and 40%, higher than some analysts had expected.Karl Keirstead, an analyst at UBS, raised his price target to $380 from $360 in a note on Friday, and said the stock price doesn't reflect the entire upside of the company's AI-powered acceleration. The shares closed on Friday at $291.31.While he recommends buying the stock, Keirstead noted several things that \"more cautious voices\" will look at in his \"bear case\" scenario. They include the risk of concentrating business with OpenAI and \"various unforeseen go-live bottlenecks\" that could come with such an aggressive buildout, he wrote.Oracle's tone remains extremely optimistic. Clay Magouyrk, who was named one of Oracle's two CEOs last month, said at the conference that this quarter's commitments have come \"across seven different contracts from four different customers.\"\"None of those customers are OpenAI,\" Magouyrk said. \"I know some people are questioning sometimes, 'Hey, is it just OpenAI?' The reality is, we think OpenAI is a great customer, but we have many customers.\"WATCH: Oracle's cloud could catch upwatch now",

    "body": "Mark Zuckerberg, chief executive officer of Meta Platforms Inc., during the Meta Connect event in Menlo Park, California, US, on Wednesday, Sept. 17, 2025. David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesMeta on Friday announced new safety features that will allow parents to see and manage how their teenagers are interacting with artificial intelligence characters on the company's platforms.Parents will have the option to turn off one-on-one chats with AI characters completely, Meta said. They will also be able to block specific AI characters, get insight into the topics their children are discussing with them.Meta is still building the controls, and the company said they will start to roll out early next year.\"Making updates that affect billions of users across Meta platforms is something we have to do with care, and we'll have more to share soon,\" Meta said in a blog post.Meta has long faced criticism over its handling of child safety and mental health on its apps. The company's new parental controls come after the Federal Trade Commission launched an inquiry into several tech companies, including Meta, over how AI chatbots could potentially harm children and teenagers.Read more CNBC tech newsBenioff's backing of Trump, troops in SF leads Salesforce Foundation director Conway to quitRay-Ban maker EssilorLuxottica says Meta smart glasses are boosting growthChinese robotaxi company Pony.ai to work with Stellantis on Europe expansionSpotify moves further into AI music with Sony, Universal, Warner partnershipThe agency said it wants to understand what steps these companies have taken to \"evaluate the safety of these chatbots when acting as companions,\" according to a release.In August, Reuters reported that Meta allowed its chatbots to have romantic and sensual conversations with kids. Reuters found that a chatbot was able to have a romantic conversation with an eight-year-old, for instance.Meta made changes to its AI chatbot policies following the report and now prevents its bots from discussing subjects like self-harm, suicide and eating disorders with teens. The AI is also supposed to avoid potentially inappropriate romantic conversations.The company announced additional AI safety updates earlier this week. Meta said its AIs should not respond to teens with \"age-inappropriate responses that would feel out of place in a PG-13 movie,\" and it's already releasing those changes across the U.S., the U.K., Australia and Canada.Parents can already set time limits on app use and see if their teenagers are chatting with AI characters, Meta said. Teens can only interact with a select group of AI characters, the company added.OpenAI, which is also named in the FTC inquiry, has made similar enhancements to its safety features for teens in recent weeks. The company officially rolled out its own parental controls late last month, and it's developing a technology to better predict a user's age.Earlier this week, OpenAI announced a council of eight experts who will advise the company and provide insight into how AI affects users' mental health, emotions and motivation.If you are having suicidal thoughts or are in distress, contact the Suicide & Crisis Lifeline at 988 for support and assistance from a trained counselor.WATCH: Megacap AI talent wars: Meta poaches another top Apple executivewatch now",

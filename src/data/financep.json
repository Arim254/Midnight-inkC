    "body": "watch nowStarbucks on Wednesday reported that its quarterly same-store sales returned to growth for the first time in nearly two years, showing that its turnaround strategy is winning over lapsed customers.The coffee chain's global same-store sales rose 1%, lifted by international markets. Its U.S. same-store sales were flat for the quarter but turned positive in September. Wall Street was projecting global same-store sales declines of 0.3% and a 0.9% decrease in U.S. same-store sales.\"Critical moment for our company, we're really proud of where we are,\" CEO Brian Niccol said in an interview on CNBC's \"Squawk on the Street\" on Thursday.Domestic same-store sales turned positive in September, and the company has held onto that momentum through October, Niccol said on the company's conference call. However, CFO Cathy Smith cautioned analysts against cheering too soon.\"Turnarounds are difficult to forecast, and while we have good reason to believe that our U.S. company-operated [same-store sales] should build through the year, we also know that recoveries are not always linear,\" she said.The American multinational chain Starbucks Coffee store and logo seen displayed. Sopa Images | Lightrocket | Getty ImagesThe company suspended its annual forecast a year ago, and it is not expecting to release a near- or long-term outlook until an investor day slated for late January.Shares of Starbucks fell more than 1% in morning trading Thursday.Here's what the company reported for the quarter ended Sept. 28 compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:Earnings per share: 52 cents adjusted vs. 56 cents expectedRevenue: $9.57 billion vs. $9.35 billion expectedThe coffee giant reported fiscal fourth-quarter net income attributable to Starbucks of $133.1 million, or 12 cents per share, down from $909.3 million, or 80 cents per share, a year earlier.Excluding restructuring costs, litigation settlements and other items, Starbucks earned 52 cents per share. During the quarter, the company closed 627 locations and laid off roughly 900 nonretail employees as part of a restructuring plan.In addition to the restructuring plan, Starbucks has been investing heavily in labor, including adding assistant store managers to many North American cafes. The added labor costs weighed on its operating margin this quarter.Net sales rose 5% to $9.57 billion.To revive U.S. sales, Starbucks has focused on improving the in-store experience for customers and cutting service times to under four minutes per order. More than 80% of company-operated locations have an average service time of four minutes or less, even as the chain saw a rise in traffic after it launched its fall menu, according to Niccol.The company's marketing efforts have switched from promotions and limited-time items to highlighting its coffee and trendy innovation, like protein-packed cold foam.The strategy has succeeded in winning back some U.S. customers. Smith said that the number of 90-day active Starbucks Rewards members grew 1% both quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year.Outside Starbucks' home market, same-store sales increased 3%, fueled by a 6% jump in traffic.In China, the company's second-largest market, same-store sales rose 2%, boosted by a 9% climb in traffic. Under pressure in the country from home-grown rivals with cheaper beverages, Starbucks has lowered prices on many of its iced drinks to bring back customers.The company is also exploring selling a stake in its China business after years of sales declines in the competitive market. Niccol previously told CNBC's Jim Cramer that the company values the China business at more than $10 billion.\"On the strategic front, we have had very strong interest from multiple high quality partners, all of whom see significant value in the Starbucks brand and team,\" Niccol said on Wednesday. \"We expect to retain a meaningful stake in Starbucks China and remain confident in the long term growth potential in the region.\"",

    "body": "watch nowPresident Donald Trump and President Xi Jinping reached a trade truce during a high-stakes meeting in South Korea on Thursday, de-escalating a dispute over rare earths elements that had threatened to push the world's two largest economies into a full-blown trade war.China agreed to pause for one year the sweeping export controls on rare earths announced on Oct. 9 that had touched off the dispute.Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One that the rare earths agreement is a one-year deal that will be \"very routinely extended as time goes by.\" The president said he plans to visit China in April and Xi will come to the U.S., either Palm Beach, Florida or Washington, D.C., at a later date\"We have a deal,\" Trump said. \"Now, every year we'll renegotiate the deal, but I think the deal will go on for a long time, long beyond the year. But all of the rare earth has been settled, and that's for the world.\"Trump said he cut tariffs effective immediately on China related to fentanyl to 10% from 20%. This reduces the overall rate on Chinese goods to around 47%, the president told reporters. Trump had previously threatened the slap China with 100% tariffs on Nov. 1 over its rare earths controls.The U.S. will postpone a rule announced on Sept. 29 that blacklisted majority-owned subsidiaries of Chinese companies on an entity list, according to a statement from China's Ministry of Commerce. The U.S. and China also agreed to suspend fees for one year on ships that dock at each other's ports.Did China win?Beijing had surprised the White House with strict export controls on rare earths ahead of the meeting between Trump and Xi, exploiting its dominance of the global supply chain to gain leverage over Washington.The U.S. is dependent on China for rare earths, which are used to produce magnets that are key inputs in weapons platforms, semiconductor manufacturing, electric vehicles and other applications.China successfully used the rare earths export controls and a soybean embargo to force the U.S. to lower tariffs, Wolfe Research strategist Tobin Marcus told clients in a note.\"Xi was ready for Trump in his second term and has a powerful weapon in rare earths,\" Piper Sandler analysts led by Andy Laperriere told clients. \"China is getting the better of the US in these recent truce negotiations.\"The truce reached between the U.S. and China is not a comprehensive deal, cautioned Nicholas Burns, former U.S. ambassador to China during the Biden administration.\"Where we are is an uneasy truce in a long, still simmering trade war,\" Burns told CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" on Thursday.Truce vague in key areasIt is not entirely clear what China has agreed to in key areas such as agriculture and energy purchases from the U.S. and cooperation on fentanyl trafficking.Trump said Beijing has agreed to purchase large amounts of a soybeans, sorghum and other farm products. China will buy 25 million metric tons of soybeans annually over the next three years, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told Fox Business in an interview.But China's Ministry of Commerce simply said the two sides agreed to expand agricultural trade without providing specifics.Read more CNBC politics coverageFed meeting live updates: Fed cut rates by 25 basis pointsTrump pardons convicted Binance founder Changpeng ZhaoChauncey Billups, others arrested in FBI probe linking NBA to Mafia gambling ringTrump to demolish entire East Wing of White House for ballroom: 'Plans changed'Government shutdown becomes 2nd longest in U.S. historyTrump special counsel nominee Paul Ingrassia withdraws after racist texts flapTrump says U.S. cattle ranchers 'don't understand' tariffs, must lower pricesOil jumps 3% after Trump administration sanctions big Russian oil companiesRussia was smug about Trump-Putin talks.

Energy Secretary Chris Wright and Interior Secretary Doug Burgum will meet with Chinese officials to see if such an agreement can be worked out, Trump said.The president said he discussed the export of Nvidia chips with Xi and will speak with CEO Jensen Huang about it. But the discussions did not cover the most advanced Blackwell graphics processing units, Trump said. It is up to China and Nvidia to reach a deal, he said.\"I said that's really between you and Nvidia, but we're sort of the arbitrator,\" Trump said on Air Force One.China's Ministry of Commerce said Beijing will work with the U.S. to \"resolve issues related to TikTok,\" though no further detail was provided. Trump did not mention TikTok during his comments to reporters aboard Air Force One or in a Truth Social post about the truce with China.",

Investors will be looking for any color from CEO Tim Cook and CFO Kevan Parekh on the demand they're seeing for the new devices.Analysts polled by FactSet expect Apple's fiscal 2025 to be the first year of iPhone sales growth since 2022.Apple has also been negatively affected by Trump administration tariffs, although the company has gotten praise from President Donald Trump over its plan to spend $600 billion in the U.S. and boost American semiconductor manufacturing. Apple also announced last week that it was shipping artificial intelligence servers from a factory in Houston.In July, Apple said it could incur $1.1 billion in tariff costs. Investors will be watching to see if its actual costs came in under its forecast, as well as what tariff costs it sees in the current quarter.Some investors want to see Apple step up its level of capital expenditure and AI spending. Apple has largely sat out the data center and AI chip investment boom that other large tech companies are spending tens of billions on.Last quarter, Cook said that it was \"significantly\" growing its investments in the technology. That will likely show up in the company's capital expenditures, but commentary from Cook may provide insight into the company's AI strategy.Cook will also likely praise the company's five-year deal with F1 to broadcast its races in the U.S. on Apple TV, the latest development in the company's sports and media strategy.Expectations remain high for Cook and Apple. In the June quarter, Apple reported 10% year-over-year revenue growth. For the September quarter, analysts polled by LSEG are expecting 7.7% sales growth.Here's what Wall Street is expecting, per LSEG estimates:EPS: $1.77Revenue: $102.24 billionAnalysts polled by LSEG expect Apple to guide to $132.31 billion in December quarter sales, and earnings of $2.53 per share.",

    "body": "Dado Ruvic | ReutersMerck on Thursday reported third-quarter earnings and revenue that topped estimates as it saw strong demand for its cancer immunotherapy Keytruda.The drugmaker also narrowed its full-year profit outlook to reflect lower estimated tariff costs, among other factors. Shares of Merck fell more than 2% in premarket trading Thursday.Sales of Keytruda topped $8 billion for the first time in a quarter, rising 10% from the same period a year ago. Revenue from the drug of $8.14 billion came in just slightly under the $8.24 billion analysts were expecting, according to StreetAccount estimates. The results come as Merck slashes $3 billion in costs by the end of 2027, and prepares to offset revenue losses from the upcoming patent expiration of Keytruda in 2028.The pharmaceutical giant now expects its 2025 adjusted earnings to come in between $8.93 and $8.98 per share. That compares with its previous outlook of $8.87 to $8.97.Merck said that reflects several new items, including \"lower estimated costs related to the impact of tariffs.\" During the previous two quarters, the company included a $200 million estimated hit from tariffs that President Donald Trump has implemented to date, but not his planned pharmaceutical-specific levies. Merck did not disclose a new estimate for the cost of existing tariffs. Merck said the guidance also reflects a benefit from an amended deal with AstraZeneca related to a pill for a specific genetic disorder, partially offset by costs tied to the company's now-completed acquisition of Verona Pharma. Merck expects revenue for the year to come in between $64.5 billion and $65 billion, narrowed on both ends from its previous guidance of $64.3 billion to $65.3 billion. Here's what Merck reported for the third quarter compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG: Earnings per share: $2.58 adjusted vs. $2.35 expectedRevenue: $17.28 billion vs. $16.96 billion expectedThe company posted net income of $5.79 billion, or $2.32 per share, for the quarter. That compares with net income of $3.16 billion, or $1.24 per share, for the year-earlier period. Excluding acquisition and restructuring costs, Merck earned $2.58 per share for the third quarter.Merck raked in $17.28 billion in revenue for the quarter, up 4% from the same period a year ago.Merck continued to see trouble with China sales of Gardasil, a vaccine that prevents cancer from HPV, the most common sexually transmitted infection in the U.S.In February, Merck announced a decision to halt shipments of Gardasil into China beginning that month. In July, CFO Caroline Litchfield said the company will not resume shipments to China through at least the end of 2025, noting that inventories remain high and demand is still soft.Gardasil generated sales of $1.75 billion for the quarter, down 24% from the same period a year ago due to lower demand in China. Still, that was in line with what analysts were expecting, according to StreetAccount.During the earnings call, investors will likely look for additional updates on Gardasil's presence in China and any details from Merck on potential drug pricing deals with Trump as part of his controversial \"most favored nation\" policy. Trump has so far inked agreements with Pfizer, AstraZeneca and EMD Serono, the largest fertility drug manufacturer in the world, that aim to make their medicines easier for Americans to access.Pharmaceutical, animal health salesMerck's pharmaceutical unit, which develops a wide range of drugs, booked $15.61 billion in revenue during the third quarter. That's up 4% from the same period a year earlier.The increase in Keytruda was driven by higher uptake of the drug for earlier-stage cancers and strong demand for the treatment for metastatic cancers, which spread to other parts of the body, the company said.Meanwhile, Merck's newer drug Winrevair, which is used to treat a rare, deadly lung condition, recorded $360 million in sales for the quarter. Analysts had expected the medication to bring in $413 million, according to StreetAccount estimates. Winrevair's growth largely reflects higher uptake in the U.S. But it was partially offset by the timing of distributor purchases of the drug and lower net pricing in the country, mainly due to changes to Medicare prescription drug plans. Merck's animal health division, which develops vaccines and medicines for dogs, cats and cattle, posted nearly $1.62 billion in sales, up 9% from the same period a year prior. The company said that mainly reflects higher demand for livestock products.Correction: Sales for Merck's animal health division were up 9% from the same period a year prior. An earlier version misstated the percentage.",

    "body": "A new Jeep Wrangler 4-Door Sahara 4x4 vehicle displayed for sale at a Stellantis NV dealership in Miami, Florida, US, on Saturday, April 5, 2025.Eva Marie Uzcategui | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesStellantis on Thursday issued a warning on one-off costs through the second half of the year as the embattled automaker seeks to respond to political, economic and regulatory challenges.The multinational conglomerate, which owns household names including Jeep, Dodge, Fiat, Chrysler and Peugeot, reaffirmed its financial guidance for the second half of the year, citing continued improvement in net revenues, cash flow and operating income.Stellantis said, however, that it expects to incur charges in the six months through to December that, once finalized, will be \"largely excluded\" from its operating income.Milan-listed shares of Stellantis fell 6% on the news. The stock price is down more than 27% year-to-date.In the U.S., shares were also down 8%.The warning on one-off charges came despite what appeared to be a fairly positive third quarter. It's likely to be seen as a welcome boost as CEO Antonio Filosa executes his turnaround plan.Stellantis said net revenues for the July-September period came in at 37.2 billion euros ($43.2 billion), reflecting an increase of 13% year-on-year, mainly driven by growth in its North American and European markets.Analysts had expected third-quarter net revenues to come in at 36.58 billion euros, according to an LSEG-compiled consensus.Read more\"As we continue to implement important strategic changes in order to provide our customers with greater freedom of choice, we have seen positive sequential progress and solid year-over-year performance in Q3, marked by the return of top-line growth,\" Stellantis' Filosa said in a statement.\"We are also taking decisive actions to align Stellantis' resources, programs and plans to support long-term, profitable growth, including our recently announced $13 billion investment in the U.S.,\" he added.Filosa told investors in a call Thursday that the U.S. is a \"key priority for our success,\" saying the new investments are \"an investment in growth.\"Stellantis unveiled plans to invest in the U.S. earlier this month as part of a push to accelerate growth and expand its domestic footprint. It marked the largest U.S. investment in the firm's 100-year history, which the company said will include the launch of five new vehicles and the creation of more than 5,000 jobs.The announcement comes amid President Donald Trump's efforts to create more manufacturing jobs in the U.S. through the use of aggressive tariffs, especially for the automotive industry. The company said the plans expand those Stellantis Chair John Elkann detailed to Trump in January.When asked about the company's mid- to long-term profit target, which former CEO Carlos Tavares was targeting to be at least 10%, Filosa said 6% to 8% would be \"reasonable,\" but said the company is focusing on quarterly improvements in key performance indicators, also known as KPIs.Filosa has largely focused on regrowing the company's market share, especially in the U.S., since becoming CEO in June.Filosa said the company is monitoring potential impacts from China's export restrictions on semiconductors made by Nexperia, which several automakers have warned of recently, including creating a cross-functional \"war room\" of employees working on the issue.",

    "body": "A general view of a Tim Hortons Drive-Thru coffeehouse and restaurant at Lakeside Retail Park on February 5, 2024 in Grays, United Kingdom.John Keeble | Getty ImagesRestaurant Brands International on Thursday reported quarterly earnings and revenue that beat analysts' expectations, fueled by growth of its international restaurants and Tim Hortons.Combined, the two divisions account for roughly 70% of the company's earnings, according to CEO Josh Kobza.Like many restaurants, the company has seen low- and middle-income consumers spend less on dining in recent quarters. Diners didn't change their behavior in the third quarter, but executives credited sticking to their strategy and avoiding the so-called value wars for the company's strong quarterly performance, particularly at Burger King's U.S. restaurants.\"If you look at our results, we're doing well despite some of those trends,\" Kobza told CNBC.Here's what the company reported compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:Earnings per share: $1.03 adjusted vs. $1 expectedRevenue: $2.45 billion vs. $2.4 billion expectedRestaurant Brands reported third-quarter net income attributable to shareholders of $315 million, or 96 cents per share, up from $252 million, or 79 cents per share, a year earlier.Excluding transaction costs and other items, the company earned $1.03 per share.Net sales rose 6.9% to $2.45 billion. The company's same-store sales, which only track the metric at restaurants open at least a year, grew 4%.Restaurant Brands' international segment was the star of the quarter, reporting 6.5% same-store sales growth. That topped the StreetAccount consensus estimate of 4.4%. The company's restaurants in Western Europe, China and Japan fueled the segment's same-store sales growth, Kobza told CNBC.Tim Hortons reported same-store sales growth of 4.2%. The Canadian coffee chain has been leaning more into food offerings to drive sales and traffic at its restaurants. Executives also said an improved iced latte is driving sales of cold drinks, which grew 10% in the quarter.Burger King's same-store sales increased 3.1%, showing that the chain's turnaround strategy in the U.S. is paying off for the business. Burger King has focused on restaurant renovations and marketing based on core menu items like the Whopper to revive domestic sales. The remodeled restaurants are paying off for franchisees as well, which is lifting operators' profitability, according to Burger King U.S. President Tom Curtis.Looking ahead, the burger chain is planning to lean into \"product elevation,\" Curtis said in an interview.\"I think that's important in an environment where you hear a lot about shrinkflation, and you hear a lot about cost cutting. So for us, we're going to be zigging while others are zagging,\" he added.Popeyes was the only Restaurant Brands division to report same-store sales declines. The chicken chain saw its same-store sales shrink 2.4%. In recent quarters, it has struggled to keep up with rivals, particularly when it comes to competition for value-minded customers.\"I think what we want to focus on in the coming quarters is making even more progress on the operational side, in terms of the consistency of the guest experience that we're delivering across the store base,\" Kobza said.Looking ahead, executives said Popeyes will also focus more on its core menu items after spending much of the last year highlighting innovations, like bone-in chicken wings.",

Google's cloud revenue accelerated 34% during the third quarter, while Microsoft Azure recorded growth of 40%.AWS stumbled last week during an extended outage that lasted more than 15 hours, taking down numerous websites as a result. Microsoft experienced outages in its Azure cloud and 365 services on Wednesday, hours before its scheduled earnings release.The Amazon unit is also battling the perception that it's missing out on a flurry of highly lucrative artificial intelligence deals for cloud services.Anthropic and Google deepened their cloud partnership last week in a deal worth tens of billions of dollars, while Meta has inked hefty cloud deals with Google and Oracle in recent months.Amazon on Wednesday opened its $11 billion AI data center called Project Rainier, which was first announced last December and is intended to train and run models from Claude chatbot creator Anthropic.Amazon, which has invested $8 billion in Anthropic, said the startup will use 1 million of its custom Trainium2 chips by the end of 2025.During last quarter's earnings conference call, investors grilled Amazon CEO Andy Jassy on AWS growth and AI competition.Jassy reiterated AWS has a \"pretty significant\" leadership position in cloud market share, while noting that it's still \"early\" days in the AI industry that remains \"very top heavy\" with a \"small number of very large frontier models.\"Read more CNBC tech newsApple's iPhone Air doesn't look like a best-seller.

Amazon said earlier this month it planned to hire 250,000 workers to staff up for peak season, the same number as the last two years.Adobe Analytics recently projected that online holiday spending in the U.S. will jump 5.3% year over year to $253.4 billion, which is slower than last year, when online sales grew 8.7% over the same period.During the third quarter, Amazon held its annual Prime Day deals event. Online spending reached $24.1 billion in the U.S. across the four-day stretch in July, according to Adobe, exceeding its estimates and representing growth of 30.3% year over year.Jassy told investors last quarter that President Donald Trump's shifting tariff policies haven't dented demand or driven up prices so far this year.Amazon's third-quarter sales are expected to increase 11.9% year over year, compared with growth of 13% in the second quarter.For the fourth quarter, analysts surveyed by LSEG are projecting sales to reach $208.1 billion, representing growth of 10.8% from a year earlier.Amazon on Tuesday initiated massive layoffs, cutting about 14,000 roles across nearly every area of the company. Executives hinted that more cuts may be on the way in the new year as the company looks to get leaner, reduce bureaucracy and invest further in AI.Once the job reductions are complete, they're expected to be the largest corporate cuts in Amazon's history, CNBC previously reported.

    "body": "Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg makes a keynote speech at the Meta Connect annual event, at the company's headquarters in Menlo Park, California, Sept. 25, 2024.Manuel Orbegozo | ReutersMeta shares dropped as much as 9% on Wednesday after the company reported third-quarter earnings that beat on sales, but it also reported a $15.93 billion one-time tax charge.Here's how the company did, compared with estimates from analysts polled by LSEG:Earnings per share: $7.25 adj. vs. $6.69 estimatedRevenue: $51.24 billion vs. $49.41 billion estimatedMeta said that the implementation of President Donald Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill Act resulted in the one-time, non-cash income tax charge. The company said it expects Trump's law to result in \"a significant reduction\" in its U.S. federal cash tax payments for the rest of 2025 and future years.The company's third-quarter sales rose 26% year-over-year, which is its highest revenue growth since the first quarter of 2024.Meta said it expects fourth quarter revenue to be in the range of $56 billon to $59 billion. The midpoint of that range comes in above what was expected by analysts, according to StreetAccount.The company raised the low end of its total expenses for the year by $2 billion, saying expenses will come in between $116 billion to $118 billion. That figure was previously $114 billion to $118 billion.CEO Mark Zuckerberg said Meta consistently requires more computing power for its artificial intelligence initiatives, resulting in more spending on related data center and cloud services.\"That suggests that being able to make a significantly larger investment here is very likely to be a profitable thing over, over some period,\" Zuckerberg added.The company also raised its 2025 guidance for capital expenditures, which will now come in the range of $70 billion to $72 billion. It's prior outlook was between the range of $66 to $72 billion.Meta's Reality Labs hardware unit reported a third-quarter loss of $4.4 billion on $470 million in sales.Revenue for Reality Labs in the fourth quarter is expected to come in lower than it did for the same period in 2024, Meta finance chief Susan Li said on a call with analysts. Li said that was due to the company not releasing a new VR headset this year and because retailers who bought inventory of Meta's previous headset for the holiday shopping season did so during the third quarter.\"We're still expecting significant year-over-year growth in AI glasses revenue in Q4 as we benefit from strong demand for the recent products that we've introduced, but that is more than offset by the headwinds to the Quest headsets,\" Li said.The company in September revealed the $799 Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses, which are Meta's first consumer-ready AI glasses with a built-in display and an accompanying wristband with neural technology. Zuckerberg said the product is sold out and that demo slots are booked through the end of November.\"We're going to have to invest in increasing manufacturing and selling more of those,\" he said.The company said that it saw 3.54 billion daily active people across its apps for the quarter, ahead of Wall Street's expectations of 3.5 billion daily active people.Meta's advertising sales were $50.08 billion during the third quarter, ahead of Wall Street's expectations of $48.5 billion.The company has spent the year investing heavily in AI, and it conducted a massive overhaul of the organization leading those efforts after the lukewarm debut of its open-source Llama 4 software in April.Meta said last Wednesday that it would lay off about 600 workers in its Superintelligence Labs AI unit, but it left that group's top-tier TBD Labs unscathed. A day before, Meta said it formed a joint venture agreement with Blue Owl Capital in a deal worth $27 billion to help fund and build a gigantic data center in Richland Parish, Louisiana.Meta said that its employee headcount was 78,450 as of Sept. 30, representing an 8% year-over-year increase.The company in September added Vibes to its Meta AI app. That feature is a feed of AI-generated videos. Since Vibes was released, downloads of Meta AI on both iOS and Android are up 56% month-to-month to a total of 3.9 million downloads as of Oct. 18, according to data provided to CNBC by mobile research firm Appfigures.\"Vibes is an example of a new content type enabled by AI, and I think that there are more opportunities to build many more novel types of content ahead,\" Zuckerberg said.Correction: Analysts expected Meta revenue to come in at $49.41 billion. That number was misstated in the earlier version of this story.WATCH: Meta reports Q3 earnings beat, company takes one-time tax chargewatch now",

Net income rose to $27.7 billion from $24.67 billion, or $3.30 per share, during the same period last year.Microsoft said its investment in OpenAI resulted in a $3.1 billion hit to net income in the quarter, equivalent to 41 cents per share.Microsoft's Intelligent Cloud unit, which includes Azure, reported $30.9 billion in revenue, up 28% from a year ago and above the StreetAccount consensus of $30.25 billion. Growth in Azure, which competes with Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud, also beat estimates, as analysts polled by StreetAccount had anticipated 38.2% expansion.Cloud continues to be the big driver of growth at Microsoft, as the business has proven to be a major beneficiary of the AI boom. Last quarter, Microsoft disclosed the scale of its Azure cloud infrastructure business in dollars for the first time. The company said revenue in fiscal 2025 from Azure and other cloud services jumped 34% from the prior year to more than $75 billion.For the fiscal second quarter, Microsoft said on the earnings call that expects revenue in the range of $79.5 billion to $80.6 billion. The middle of the range is $80.05 billion, while analysts were expecting $79.95 billion, according to LSEG.The company said it expects Azure growth at constant currency will be 37% in the fiscal second quarter, inline with estimates.Investors were listening closely for Microsoft's commentary on capital expenditures as the company races to build out the infrastructure necessary to support AI demand.

PSLF, signed into law in 2007 by George W. Bush, offers debt cancellation after a decade to borrowers who work for non-profits and the government.Under the new Trump administration policy, organizations \"that engage in unlawful activities\" such as \"supporting terrorism and aiding and abetting illegal immigration\" will be excluded from the program, according to an Education Department statement.More than 40 million Americans hold student loans, and the outstanding debt exceeds $1.6 trillion. Over 9 million borrowers may be eligible for PSLF, according to a 2022 estimate from Protect Borrowers, a nonprofit focused on student loans.Read more CNBC personal finance coverageStudent loan forgiveness for public servants to be limited under TrumpDemocrats propose increasing VA, Social Security benefits by $200 a monthAdjustable-rate mortgages are 'underappreciated,' top advisor saysHow the 2026 Social Security payroll tax cap could impact your paycheckWhat this Fed rate cut means for your credit card, mortgage and savings accountHow the Fed's decision to lower rates could widen the generational wealth gapThis investing move is the 'holy grail of retirement planning,' advisor saysWhat another Fed cut could mean for borrowers — some rates may barely budgeWhat student loan borrowers need to know, as forgiveness resumes under two plansAmericans face a retirement 'confidence paradox': How to gauge readinessGovernment shutdown curtails nonprofit funding, putting services in jeopardyMore investors are interested in alts — advisors say there's an easy way inSocial Security announces 2026 COLA benefit increase of 2.8% — what it means for youCongress passes bill to fix IRS 'math error' notices.

    "body": "A Social Security Administration office in Washington, D.C., March 26, 2025.Saul Loeb | Afp | Getty ImagesTo help Social Security and Veterans Affairs beneficiaries cope with higher prices, a group of Democratic senators are proposing to increase benefits by $200 per month for six months.The bill — called the Social Security Emergency Inflation Relief Act — is backed by Democratic Senators including Mark Kelly of Arizona, Alex Padilla of California, Tammy Duckworth of Illinois, Angela Alsobrooks and Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Tina Smith of Minnesota, Kirsten Gillibrand and Chuck Schumer of New York, Ron Wyden of Oregon and Peter Welch of Vermont.The leaders plan to introduce the proposal on Thursday morning, according to a Warren spokesperson.The extra $200-per-month emergency increase would boost benefit payments through July 2026, according to the senators' proposal. The benefit boost would apply to individuals receiving benefits from Social Security, Supplemental Security Income, railroad retirement, veteran disability compensation and veteran pensions.Read more CNBC personal finance coverageStudent loan forgiveness for public servants to be limited under TrumpDemocrats propose increasing VA, Social Security benefits by $200 a monthAdjustable-rate mortgages are 'underappreciated,' top advisor saysHow the 2026 Social Security payroll tax cap could impact your paycheckWhat this Fed rate cut means for your credit card, mortgage and savings accountHow the Fed's decision to lower rates could widen the generational wealth gapThis investing move is the 'holy grail of retirement planning,' advisor saysWhat another Fed cut could mean for borrowers — some rates may barely budgeWhat student loan borrowers need to know, as forgiveness resumes under two plansAmericans face a retirement 'confidence paradox': How to gauge readinessGovernment shutdown curtails nonprofit funding, putting services in jeopardyMore investors are interested in alts — advisors say there's an easy way inSocial Security announces 2026 COLA benefit increase of 2.8% — what it means for youCongress passes bill to fix IRS 'math error' notices. What it means for taxpayersCNBC's Financial Advisor 100: Best financial advisors, top firms for 2025 rankedThe proposal follows the Social Security Administration's Friday announcement of a 2.8% cost-of-living adjustment for 2026. The annual adjustment is intended to help Social Security and Supplemental Security Income benefits maintain their buying power.The 2.8% increase will add about $56 per month to Social Security retirement benefits, on average, starting in January, according to the Social Security Administration.Almost 71 million Social Security beneficiaries will see the 2026 cost-of-living adjustment reflected in their payments starting in January, according to the Social Security Administration, while nearly 7.5 million Supplemental Security Income beneficiaries will see the benefit boost starting in late December.An 'emergency lifeline for seniors'The adjustment for 2026 is \"not enough\" for seniors who face \"skyrocketing\" costs when it comes to groceries, health care and utilities, Warren wrote in an Oct. 24 social media post.In a statement, Warren called the bill to provide an extra $200 per month to beneficiaries an \"emergency lifeline for seniors struggling to afford Trump's tariffs and rising inflation.\"Schumer, in a separate statement, said the Social Security COLA is \"simply not reflective of the current reality\" for seniors as they see their bank accounts shrinking.watch nowThe latest consumer price index data shows inflation increased at an annual rate of 3% in September, which was lower than expectations. While that rate is above the 2% target the Federal Reserve has set, inflation is easing in some areas, according to the data.Price levels from the 2025 tariffs are expected to rise by 1.3%, according to an Oct. 17 analysis by Yale's Budget Lab, prompting an average household income loss of $1,800 in 2025.In 2026, retirees may face higher premiums for Medicare Part B. Those monthly premium payments are typically deducted directly from Social Security checks, and therefore affect how much of the cost-of-living adjustment beneficiaries may see. The projected standard Medicare Part B premium for 2026 is $206.50 per month, according to projections from Medicare trustees. That would be a $21.50 increase from the $185 standard premium rate in place for 2025.On Monday, another group of Democratic lawmakers proposed a bill, the Boosting Benefits and COLAs for Seniors Act, that calls for basing the annual cost-of-living adjustment on the CPI-E, or Consumer Price Index for the Elderly, a research index that tracks the spending patterns of Americans ages 62 and over.Social Security's annual COLA adjustments are currently based on a subset of the consumer price index — the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers, or CPI-W, which tracks price changes for goods and services bought by certain workers.Changing the Social Security COLA to be indexed to the CPI-E would increase the future adjustments by about 0.2 percentage points, Social Security's chief actuary has estimated, according to research from the Bipartisan Policy Center. That change would also increase the program's long-term shortfall by an estimated 11%, according to the estimate.It is not clear how much the senators' proposal to add $200 per month to benefits would cost or whether it would affect Social Security's trust fund depletion dates. The Congressional Budget Office has not scored the proposal.",

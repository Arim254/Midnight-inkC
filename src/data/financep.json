    "body": "Call it a golden era for gold. After a historic 60% runup in 2025, the shiny stuff is hitting new highs this year, with prices currently exceeding $4,900 an ounce. What's good for gold isn't necessarily great for other parts of the market. The precious metal has long been considered a \"safe haven\" asset, meaning that investors tend to flee other assets and flock to gold in the midst of economic or geopolitical turmoil. Investors can take their pick of dustups fueling market uncertainty and driving up gold prices, from the federal investigation into Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell, to the U.S. military operation in Venezuela to the recent economic saber-rattling over a U.S. push to control Greenland, Nicky Shiels, head of metals strategy at commodities firm MKS PAMP, recently told CNBC. \"You're entering a world where ... there is a strong demand to secure critical metals, critical commodities in this decade,\" she said. Generally, investors can hold gold in one of two ways: physically in the form of coins or bars or through an exchange-traded fund or mutual fund which tracks the fluctuations in the metal's price. Which approach is right for you depends on your reason for holding, says Mike Casey, a certified financial planner with AE Advisors in Alexandria, Virginia. \"I would reserve physical gold for no more than 5-10% of a diversified portfolio if you're risk-tolerant, value sovereignty or anticipate prolonged instability,\" he says. \"Otherwise, stick to paper gold.\"It's also smart to consult a trusted financial professional before making any changes to your portfolio.Owning physical gold as a disaster hedgeMany investors favor gold during times of instability, as it has been considered currency for millennia. Should something go seriously wrong with the financial system, such as a large-scale devaluation of the U.S. dollar, owning some precious metals could come in handy, says John Bell, a CFP with Free State Financial Planning in Highland, Maryland, adding that he typically advises clients interested in gold to own a mix of physical and \"paper\" gold. \"While I am not a doom and gloom person who thinks the apocalypse is upon us, I like the fact that gold and silver are outside the broad banking and financial services system,\" Bell says. \"For instance, you can access it any time if it is physical and take it to a local dealer to get money.\"Gold comes with a couple of other advantages during trying times, Casey adds. \"It eliminates counterparty risk,\" he says, meaning you won't have to rely on a mutual fund company or brokerage to give you your money. \"[It] provides tangible ownership, and can serve as a privacy shield in uncertain times — think estate planning or cross-border mobility.\"There are some drawbacks to holding gold this way, however. You'll generally have to pay a premium over gold's \"spot\" price (the price ETFs track) to own the physical stuff — often a 5% to 10% markup, Casey says — plus pay extra to store it somewhere, unless you're comfortable stashing it under your mattress. Plus, under normal circumstances, it's much harder to sell your physical gold for cash than it is to click \"sell\" on your your gold ETF position in your brokerage account. Owning gold as a portfolio diversifierEven if you don't have major concerns about geopolitics or the economy, there's still a case to made for owning some exposure to gold, says Casey. \"Gold's allure lies in its role as a portfolio diversifier,\" he says. \"It's historically non-correlated with stocks and bonds, offering stability during market volatility or currency devaluation.\"In other words, the factors that drive gold prices are different than the ones that drive the returns on stocks and bonds, such as corporate earnings and interest rates. And as Casey points out, gold has maintained or grown in value during some periods of market turbulence. In 2002, for instance, when the S&P 500 dropped more than 22%, gold rose by nearly 25%. Gold also posted a nearly 6% uptick in price in 2008, a year in which the broad stock market fell by 37%. Of course, gold doesn't move in the opposite direction as the stock market all of the time — 2025 was a great year for gold and a good one for stocks. But owning a mix of assets that perform differently under different conditions reduces overall volatility in your portfolio and generally provides a smoother ride, experts say. To add \"paper\" gold to your portfolio, consider buying a mutual fund or ETF that tracks the change in the metal's price. These funds are generally backed by a physical cache of precious metals and do an accurate job tracking the spot price. The reason investing experts recommend keeping gold as a small portion of a diversified portfolio is that unlike other assets, such as stocks and bonds, gold doesn't generate profits or throw off cash. \"It simply sits there, unchanged and unproductive, its value dependent on what the next buyer is willing to pay,\" says Alex Canellopoulos, a CFP with Vista Capital Partners in Portland, Oregon. \"That doesn't mean investors never benefit from rising gold prices,\" he says. But he and other experts caution against making it a major building block of your portfolio. Want to get ahead at work with AI?

    "body": "U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and Director of the United States Office of Management and Budget, Russell Vought.Kevin Mohatt | Kevin Lamarque | | ReutersSen. Elizabeth Warren on Friday accused the acting head of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau of undermining President Donald Trump's stated push to make credit cards more affordable, according to a letter obtained exclusively by CNBC.In a letter to acting CFPB Director Russell Vought, Warren, D-Mass., noted that in the last year the agency has dropped a rule limiting credit card late fees, sided with lenders in lawsuits over deceptive practices and paused enforcement actions against the industry.Earlier this month, Trump demanded in a social media post that U.S. banks voluntarily cap credit card interest rates at 10% for a year. When they didn't, Trump this week called on lawmakers to pass legislation on the issue.\"I spoke with President Trump last week and told him that Congress could pass legislation to cap credit card rates, if he would fight for it,\" Warren wrote in her letter to Vought. \"While Congress considers legislation to address the issue, your own actions are directly undermining the President's stated goals,\" she wrote. \"Under your leadership, the CPFB has taken steps to make it easier—not harder—for big banks and credit card companies to rip off Americans.\"The letter from Warren seizes on Trump's pivot to affordability and seeks to leverage his initiative against his own administration, escalating tensions over the financial regulatory agency that she helped to create under the Obama administration. Members of the Trump administration have sought to shutter the CFPB as part of a broader pro-business deregulatory agenda.Current and former CFPB employees have said the agency is on life support under Vought, who has fought in court to enact mass layoffs and stop the agency's funding.An agency spokesperson said that the CFPB was disallowed from limiting credit card rates by the Dodd Frank Act.Vought should be \"using the full scope of [the CFPB's] authorities to address excessive credit card costs and to crack down on bad actors,\" instead of trying to dismantle the agency, Warren wrote.She directed Vought to \"immediately reinstate its rule capping credit card late fees at $8, which would save Americans more than $10 billion annually,\" Warren said.She contended Vought should also tamp down on deceptive practices around the industry's deferred interest promotions, resume enforcement of rules around monitoring interest rate increases, respond to a mounting pile of consumer complaints, and halt bait-and-switch tactics with rewards programs.\"Either President Trump is not serious about making credit cards more affordable or you are insubordinately disregarding his direction,\" she wrote.watch now",

Fabrice Coffrini | Afp | Getty ImagesBEIJING — Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang plans to visit China in the coming days ahead of the mid-February Lunar New Year, two people familiar with the matter told CNBC. The trip comes as questions persist over the U.S. chip giant's ability to sell in the Chinese market, which once accounted for at least one-fifth of revenue from Nvidia's data center business.U.S. export restrictions have prevented Nvidia from selling its most advanced chips to China as Washington seeks to maintain an edge over Beijing in chips used to develop cutting-edge artificial intelligence.Huang is expected to attend an Nvidia company party in Beijing on Monday, said one of the sources, who requested anonymity to speak about the trip.He is also set to meet with potential buyers in China and discuss recent logistical challenges in supplying U.S.-approved Nvidia chips into the market, according to a person with direct knowledge of the travel plans. The Information reported last week, citing sources, that China would only approve local purchases of Nvidia's H200 AI chips for limited purposes such as research. When asked about the report Thursday, China's Commerce Ministry claimed it was unaware of the situation. Bloomberg first reported news of Huang's China trip earlier this week. Nvidia declined to comment on executive travel plans. Huang visited mainland China at least three times last year, including in January for Lunar New Year celebrations. \n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tWeekly analysis and insights from Asia's largest economy in your inbox\n\t\t\tSubscribe now\n\t\t\n\t",

    "body": "watch nowPresident Donald Trump's push for mineral rights in Greenland may be the latest play in long-standing U.S. efforts to block China from accessing rare earths on the world's largest island. Trump has disclosed few details about the Greenland framework deal that he announced after meeting with NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte on Wednesday. But he told CNBC that it includes mineral rights for the U.S. and other partners, presumably NATO allies though it's unclear at this stage.\"They're going to be involved in the Golden Dome, and they're going to be involved in mineral rights, and so are we,\" Trump said in an interview with CNBC's Joe Kernen at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.The Trump administration declined requests for further information when asked by CNBC. White House spokeswoman Anna Kelly said, \"as details are finalized by all parties involved, they will be released accordingly.\" \"If this deal goes through, and President Trump is very hopeful it will, the United States will be achieving all of its strategic goals with respect to Greenland, at very little cost, forever,\" Kelly said in a statement.Rare earths are used to make magnets that are key inputs for strategic industries like defense and robotics. China dominates the global supply chain and blocked exports in trade disputes with the U.S. last year. Beijing declared itself a \"near-Arctic state\" and regional stakeholder in 2018.Trump has made developing a Western rare earth supply chain a central objective of his industrial policy as he seeks to reduce U.S. dependence on China. Greenland has the eighth-largest rare earth reserves in the world at 1.5 million metric tons, according to 2024 data from the U.S. Geological Survey. Beijing has a financial interest in the Kvanefjeld mining project in Greenland's south. It is the third-largest known land deposit of rare earths in the world, according the Center for Strategic and International Studies. China's Shenghe Resources is the second-largest investor in Kvanefjeld's owner, Australia's Energy Transition Minerals. The project came to a halt after Greenland banned uranium mining in 2021 and it is now mired in litigation.A framework that provides the U.S. with priority access to Greenland's rare earths \"might ensure that a Chinese partner or somebody else doesn't come back to the table to develop those resources,\" said Ryan Castilloux, founder of Adamas Intelligence, a rare earth market research firm. Greenland's resourcesA second project called Tanbreez is under development in Greenland's south by New York City headquartered Critical Metals. The company has described Tanbreez as one of the largest rare earth deposits in the world. Critical Metals received a letter of interest from the Export-Import Bank of the United States earlier this month that could result in a $120 million loan for the development of Tanbreez. The company's stock rallied about 21% on Thursday and has nearly tripled in value this year. watch nowThe Biden administration was also worried about China gaining access to Greenland's rare earths. It lobbied the developer, Tanbreez Mining, to not sell the project to a China-linked company, CEO Greg Barnes told Reuters in January 2025. Tanbreez was ultimately acquired by Critical Metals.Economic challengesTrump said at Davos that his push for Greenland is not about extracting rare earths. He has said U.S. interests in Greenland are about blocking China's and Russia's ambitions in the Arctic. \"I want Greenland for security. I don't want it for anything else,\" Trump told reporters Wednesday before meeting with the NATO chief. \"We have so much rare earth, we don't know what to do with it. We don't need it for anything else.\" The pipeline for rare earth supplies is full after the U.S. made significant progress in standing up its supply chain over the past year, Castilloux said. The Pentagon struck an agreement last year with rare earth miner MP Materials that included an equity stake, price floor and offtake agreement. Supplies from Greenland are not needed in the near term, though that could change over a longer time horizon, Castilloux said. The economics of mining in Greenland are challenging, the analyst said. The island's remote location and infrastructure gaps would bring higher development costs, he said. Greenland's small population means at least some of the skilled workforce would have to be flown in and out. Shipping costs would also be higher, he said. Trump was blunt Wednesday about the cost of rare earth mining in Greenland.\"In terms of Greenland, you know, you have to go 25 feet down through ice to get it,\" Trump said. \"It's not something that a lot of people are going to do or want to do.\" \"No, this is security we're talking about,\" he said.",

The country pumps about 3.4 million barrels per day, according to Kpler. That number pales in comparison with the U.S. and Saudi Arabia, which pump about 13.5 million barrels per day and 9.5 million barrels per day, respectively, according to data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration and OPEC.Yet a recent wave of protests in Iran spurred by the plummet in the nation's rial currency and Trump's subsequent suggestions that the U.S. could take military action in the country have rocked energy markets.\"Oil markets are moving on fear,\" Helima Croft, global head of commodity strategy at RBC Capital Markets, told CNBC. \"It's basically a concern about disruption.\"Market anxiety grew Friday as tensions between Iran and the U.S. escalated. \"We're watching Iran,\" Trump told reporters Thursday. \"You know we have a lot of ships going in that direction just in case. We have a big flotilla going in that direction and we'll see what happens.\"Trump's comments come as more than 5,000 people have died in Iran since the protests began on Dec. 28, according to the Human Rights Activists News Agency. \"They were going to hang 837 people,\" Trump said in an interview with CNBC on Wednesday. \"And I told them, you can't do that. If you do that, it's going to be bad.\" While the market is well supplied for the time being, OPEC and its allies, which pump about 40% of the world's oil, hiked their output last year, cutting into spare capacity.\"If we were to get a confrontation between the U.S. and Iran that led to the loss of Iranian oil exports, there just isn't a lot left in the OPEC tank to cover that,\" Croft said. Concerns around a larger regional conflict have also lifted prices given Iran's proximity to some of the world's largest oil producers -- namely Saudi Arabia.\"Iran's location is strategically very important when we think about critical waterways like the Strait of Hormuz, which is a major chokepoint for oil, and we have seen Iran and Iranian-backed groups before target tankers and target critical infrastructure in the Gulf,\" said Croft. In 2019, Iran launched a series of attacks on oil tankers in the Strait of Hormuz. About 20% of global crude flows through the narrow waterway, according to the EIA.Despite pulling back threats of military intervention, Trump confirmed to CNBC on Wednesday that 25% tariffs on countries doing business with Iran are \"going forward.\"Existing sanctions on Iran have already hampered the country's crude exports, with the vast majority going to independent Chinese refiners that buy the oil at a discount to benchmark prices.\"Can you really squeeze Iran much more given where their barrels are going?\" said Croft. \"[Have] sanctions now lost [the] ability to kind of move the needle when it comes to Iranian policy?\"Watch the video above to learn more about Iran's impact on oil markets and what it could mean for consumers.",

He said production efficiency, or yield, is also below his targets. \"We are on a multiyear journey,\" he said. \"It will take time and resolve.\"The chipmaker expects first-quarter revenue to range between $11.7 billion and $12.7 billion, and adjusted earnings per share to break even. That was below LSEG expectations for earnings of 5 cents per share and $12.51 billion in revenue. Over the last year, Intel shares have rallied more than double on hopes of a turnaround for the embattled American chipmaker, following investments from the U.S. government, SoftBank and Nvidia.Read more CNBC tech newsWaymo launches robotaxi service in Miami, extending U.S. leadTrump wants Nvidia to sell powerful AI chips to Beijing.

    "body": "watch nowThe sudden collapse last fall of a string of American companies backed by private credit has thrust a fast-growing and opaque corner of Wall Street lending into the spotlight.Private credit, also known as direct lending, is a catch-all term for lending done by nonbank institutions. The practice has been around for decades but surged in popularity after post-2008 financial crisis regulations discouraged banks from serving riskier borrowers. That growth — from $3.4 trillion in 2025 to an estimated $4.9 trillion by 2029 — and the September bankruptcies of auto-industry firms Tricolor and First Brands have emboldened some prominent Wall Street figures to raise alarms about the asset class.JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon warned in October that problems in credit are rarely isolated: \"When you see one cockroach, there are probably more.\" Billionaire bond investor Jeffrey Gundlach a month later accused private lenders of making \"garbage loans\" and predicted that the next financial crisis will come from private credit.While fears about private credit have subsided in recent weeks in the absence of more high-profile bankruptcies or losses disclosed by banks, they haven't lifted completely.Companies that are most linked to the asset class, such as Blue Owl Capital, as well as alternative asset giants Blackstone and KKR, still trade well below their recent highs.The rise of private creditPrivate credit is \"lightly regulated, less transparent, opaque, and it's growing really fast, which doesn't necessarily mean there's a problem in the financial system, but it is a necessary condition for one,\" Moody's Analytics chief economist Mark Zandi said in an interview. Private credit's boosters, such as Apollo co-founder Marc Rowan, have said that the rise of private credit has fueled American economic growth by filling the gap left by banks, served investors with good returns and made the broader financial system more resilient.Big investors including pensions and insurance companies with long-term liabilities are seen as better sources of capital for multiyear corporate loans than banks funded by short-term deposits, which can be flighty, private credit operators told CNBC. But concerns about private credit — which tend to come from the sector's competitors in public debt — are understandable given its attributes.After all, it's the asset managers making private credit loans that are the ones valuing them, and they can be motivated to delay the recognition of potential borrower problems. \"The double-edged sword of private credit\" is that the lenders have \"really strong incentives to monitor for problems,\" said Duke Law professor Elisabeth de Fontenay.\"But by the same token … they do in fact have incentives to try to disguise risk, if they think or hope that there might be some way out of it down the road,\" she said.De Fontenay, who has studied the impact of private equity and debt on corporate America, said her biggest concern is that it's difficult to know if private lenders are accurately marking their loans, she said.\"This is a market that is extraordinarily large and that is reaching more and more businesses, and yet it's not a public market,\" she said. \"We're not entirely sure if the valuations are correct.\"In the November collapse of home improvement firm Renovo, for instance, BlackRock and other private lenders deemed its debt to be worth 100 cents on the dollar until shortly before marking it down to zero.Defaults among private loans are expected to rise this year, especially as signs of stress among less creditworthy borrowers emerge, according to a Kroll Bond Rating Agency report.And private credit borrowers are increasingly relying on payment-in-kind options to forestall defaulting on loans, according to Bloomberg, which cited valuation firm Lincoln International and its own data analysis.Ironically, while they are competitors, part of the private credit boom has been funded by banks themselves.Finance frenemiesAfter investment bank Jefferies, JPMorgan and Fifth Third disclosed losses tied to the auto industry bankruptcies in the fall, investors learned the extent of this form of lending. Bank loans to non-depository financial institutions, or NDFIs, reached $1.14 trillion last year, per the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.On Jan. 13, JPMorgan disclosed for the first time its lending to nonbank financial firms as part of its fourth-quarter earnings presentation. The category tripled to about $160 billion in loans in 2025 from about $50 billion in 2018.Banks are now \"back in the game\" because deregulation under the Trump administration will free up capital for them to expand lending, Moody's Zandi said. That, combined with newer entrants in private credit, might lead to lower loan underwriting standards, he said.\"You're seeing a lot of competition now for the same type of lending,\" Zandi said. \"If history is any guide, that's a concern ... because it probably argues for a weakening in underwriting and ultimately bigger credit problems down the road.\"While neither Zandi nor de Fontenay said they saw an imminent collapse in the sector, as private credit continues to grow, so will its importance to the U.S. financial system.When banks hit turbulence because of the loans they made, there is an established regulatory playbook, but future problems in the private realm might be harder to resolve, according to de Fontenay.\"It raises broader questions from the perspective of the safety and soundness of the overall system,\" de Fontenay said. \"Are we going to know enough to know when there are signs of problems before they actually occur?\"",

    "body": "watch nowBinance founder Changpeng \"CZ\" Zhao said his business relationship with President Donald Trump's family has been \"misconstrued\" in the wake of his pardon. \"There's no business relationships whatsoever,\" Zhao told CNBC's Andrew Ross Sorkin on Thursday in an interview at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.The former Binance CEO served four months in prison after pleading guilty in 2023 to charges he enabled money laundering during his time leading the company. Zhao was released in September 2024.Trump's pardon in October 2025 drew attention to Binance's ties to World Liberty Financial, a crypto company founded by the president's family.The connection stems from a $2 billion investment in March 2025 by state-owned firm MGX of Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, into Binance. MGX paid using USD1, a stablecoin created by World Liberty Financial.Zhao stepped down as Binance's CEO in 2023 as part of the plea deal and $4.3 billion settlement with the Department of Justice. He remains a major shareholder.\"MGX is the investor. They choose USD1,\" Zhao told CNBC. \"My request to them was they pay us in crypto. I don't want to deal with banks, really.\"\"Many people misconstrued that,\" he added.Zhao told CNBC the company has since converted that investment out of USD1 in portions over time.\"Stablecoin is just a currency for payment. Just because I accepted that, it doesn't mean I invested in the issuer of that,\" he said.\"As we have stated many times, WLFI is not a political organization and had zero role in the pardon process,\" World Liberty Financial spokesperson David Wachsman said in a statement. \"To imply otherwise is dangerous and false.\"Read more CNBC tech newsWaymo launches robotaxi service in Miami, extending U.S. leadTrump wants Nvidia to sell powerful AI chips to Beijing.

McDowell is a friend of Donald Trump Jr., the president's son.Checkmate disclosed that it was paid $450,000 for work that included lobbying the White House and Treasury Department for \"executive relief\" and \"financial services policy issues relating to digital assets and cryptocurrency.\"\"There is a lot of media saying that there is some deal in place to get me the pardon,\" Zhao told CNBC at Davos. \"As far as I know, that does not exist at all.\"Zhao told CNBC at Davos that he has still not spoken directly with Trump.\"The closest that I got to him was today when he was doing the Board of Peace session,\" Zhao said. \"I was in the audience, about 30 to 40 feet away from him.\"In a CBS \"60 Minutes\" interview in November, Trump affirmed that he did not know Zhao.\"I have no idea who he is,\" Trump said. \"I was told that he was a victim, just like I was and just like many other people, of a vicious, horrible group of people in the Biden administration.\"— CNBC's Jacqueline Corba contributed to this story.",

    "body": "watch nowU.S. President Donald Trump withdrew the invitation to Canada to join his \"Board of Peace,\" days after Prime Minister Mark Carney's address in Davos warning against economic coersion by the world's superpowers.   \"Dear Prime Minister Carney: Please let this Letter serve to represent that the Board of Peace is withdrawing its invitation to you regarding Canada's joining,\" Trump said in a post on Truth Social on Thursday night stateside. Carney said last week that he intended to join the board but details, including financial terms, had yet to be worked out. States looking for a permanent seat need to pay $1 billion.In his speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, earlier this week, Carney said the world's \"middle powers\" must band together to resist coercion from the world's largest powers. \"Great powers have begun using economic integration as weapons. Tariffs as leverage, financial infrastructure as coercion, supply chains as vulnerabilities to be exploited,\" he said. While Carney did not name any country, Trump responded later, saying on the sidelines of the forum that \"Canada lives because of the United States. Remember that, Mark, the next time you make your statements.\" Hours before Carney's speech, Trump had posted on social media a digitally-altered image of a map with Greenland, Venezuela and Canada covered with American flag.  Recent events have shown that \"the rules-based international order\" is effectively dead, while the world's superpowers \"pursue their interests using economic integration as a weapon of coercion,\" Carney said in his speech.  Relations between the two longstanding allies have come under heavy strain in Trump's second term, who has referred to the neighboring country as the U.S.' 51st state, besides targeting it with tariffs. U.S. President Donald Trump (R) meets with Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney in the Oval Office of the White House on October 07, 2025 in Washington, DC. Anna Moneymaker | Getty ImagesThe \"Board of Peace,\" chaired by Trump, was originally conceived to oversee the demilitarization and rebuilding of Gaza strip after a two-year war with Israel. But Trump said he foresees the board to take a wider role that could ultimately rival the United Nations, a remit that has alarmed several U.S. allies. Trump has garnered the support from regional Middle East countries including Turkey, Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Qatar, as well as emerging economies such as Indonesia. But several global powers and traditional Western U.S. allies have been more cautious, including Australia, France, Germany, Italy and some have rejected the proposal. U.K. Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper reportedly said that it \"won't be one of the signatories\" citing concerns over Russian President Vladimir Putin's invitation to join.  Russia and China are among those invited to join the board. Putin reportedly told the Russian security council that the foreign ministry was still studying the proposal while China has not confirmed whether it will join. Carney's WEF address followed his high-profile visit to China last week, where he reached a wide-ranging agreement with President Xi Jinping to reduce tariffs and rebuild ties. As part of the deal, Beijing cut tariffs on a number of agricultural products from Canada while Ottawa increased the quotas for imports of Chinese electric vehicles into its market with the most-favored-nation tariff rate of 6.1%. Carney hailed his strategic partnership with Xi, touting the importance of their ties in the face of a \"new world order,\" in a veiled reference to the global instability caused by Trump's foreign policy swings and disruptive trade agenda.

Drell, 70, stepped down to pursue a \"new professional opportunity,\" Nvidia said, and not because of a disagreement with company or any matter related to its operations or policies. Drell, who served on the compensation committee, is the first Nvidia board member to depart since astronaut Ellen Ochoa resigned in June. The board now has 10 directors, including CEO Jensen Huang. Drell owns close to 143,000 Nvidia shares, worth about $26 million, according to the latest holdings report. She was paid about $344,000 for her work with Nvidia last year, including almost $259,000 in stock awards, the company's annual report said. Nvidia's stock price is up over 22,000% since the end of 2015, emerging as the most valuable company in the world thanks to the artificial intelligence boom. Drell sold about 40,000 shares last year. Drell has been a professor at Stanford since 2002, serving as the dean of the engineering school from 2014 to 2017 and as Stanford's provost from 2017 to 2023. She was also director of Stanford's particle accelerator, called SLAC, from 2007 to 2012. Correction: This story has been revised to reflect that Persis Drell is 70 years old.

(Photo by Sean Gallup/Getty Images)Sean Gallup | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesA former official of U.S. President Donald Trump's first administration is planning a multi-billion-dollar data center project in a remote corner of Greenland, as hyperscalers scramble to build out capacity across the globe to keep up with the AI rollout.The data center is aiming to be operational at 300 megawatts (MW) by mid-2027, before further expansion would see it hit 1.5 gigawatts (GW) by the end of 2028.While that's currently several times the power capacity of any active data center in the world, there are plans to build multiple 1 GW-plus facilities across the globe over the next two years as the race to develop AI infrastructure continues to gather pace.The Greenland data center project will cost billions of dollars to complete and has binding commitments with investors to finance half of its initial phase of development and half of the final phase, Drew Horn, a senior aide to Trump's first-term vice president Mike Pence and CEO of GreenMet, a company that's offering strategic support to the project, told CNBC. The venture is eyeing a buildout in the Kangerlussuaq area, a small settlement at the end of a deep fjord on the southwest coast of the Arctic island, with an airport, he added.Technical partners have been enlisted to help with the physical buildout, but the project has yet to secure land or approvals from the local authorities, Horn said. He declined to share the names of the other companies involved in the venture because the information isn't public yet.Commercial opportunities in Greenland have been thrust into the spotlight in recent weeks as the Arctic island has become the center of a geopolitical firestorm after U.S. President Donald Trump doubled down on acquisition talk. Critical minerals mining and freshwater reserves have been touted as potential prospects, though skeptics point to logistical challenges around tapping into them with Greenland's limited infrastructure.  watch nowMulti-billion-dollar data centerData center deals hit a record $61 billion in 2025 amid a rush to build out the infrastructure needed to power energy-intensive AI workloads. Big tech firms, including Meta, OpenAI, Oracle, AWS, Microsoft and Google are investing huge sums into developing facilities across the globe. Work on plans for the Greenland data center project began a year ago, and Horn told CNBC it has secured technical partners to assist with construction, operation and supplying energy.Committed financing, which is in the form of debt and equity, is contingent on the project meeting key milestones, including securing permits from local government, said Horn — who was also a senior advisor to both the energy and intelligence departments towards the end of Trump's first term.Other former senior Trump employees also have stakes in GreenMet, which says on its website that it helps companies with government and private funding and strategic partnerships.  George Sorial, who was an executive vice president and chief compliance counsel at the Trump Organization until 2019, and Keith Schiller, who was a longtime bodyguard for Trump and director of Oval Office operations during the U.S. president's first term, helped set up the company in 2021 and remain shareholders.\"We are not actively involved with GreenMet or Greenland,\" Sorial told CNBC. \"We are passive minority shareholders in GreenMet and have no management role in the company.\" Schiller had not responded to a CNBC request for comment as this story went live.The GreenMet CEO has been developing relationships with officials in the Greenlandic and Danish administrations as he looks to advance the project. He met the Danish Ambassador to the U.S. Jesper Møller Sørensen on Wednesday, as part of a \"continuing dialogue,\" to discuss the data center, Horn said. CNBC has approached Denmark's U.S. embassy for comment.While officials on all sides have been supportive of the project, the \"issue is not so much on the private side, it's on the diplomatic,\" Horn said, pointing to the geopolitical tensions surrounding the U.S. push to acquire Greenland, a semi-autonomous Danish territory.Tensions have cooled since Trump backtracked on plans to impose tariffs on several European nations over the issue, but questions still remain as negotiations around U.S. military and economic involvement in Greenland continue.\"Our effort, which is purely private, it succeeds only if we have the buy-in from the relevant affected parties and countries,\" Horn said.Securing power\"Larger corporate entities\" will be taking the lead on the construction and development of the data center, but GreenMet will continue to be involved as an advisor as the project looks to secure government investment from nations including the U.S., Greenland, Denmark, and other NATO countries, Horn told CNBC. \"We've spent about a year putting together everything from the power to the technology components, [and] we have a Greenlandic partner on the ground,\" Horn said. \"Right now we're waiting on approvals from the Greenlandic side.\"A big challenge for projects of this scale in Greenland is access to power. For the first phase of the project, which is targeting 300 MW power capacity, the plan is to use specialized barges carrying Liquefied Natural Gas to the fjord, Horn said.The venture plans to build a hydroelectric facility — 70% of the island's energy comes from such facilities — to power the second phase, which would see the data center hit 1.5 GW capacity. Permits and approvals from the Greenlandic government are still pending for both the barges and the facility. Greenland's Ministry of Business has been approached for comment.Kangerlussuaq Fjord.

There are some significant advantages to building data centers in an environment with low temperatures, analysts told CNBC.\"The biggest value sits in its resource profile, specifically in hydro for electricity generation and a 'free cooling' proposition given the lower ambient temperature,\" Noah Ramos, strategist at investment research firm Alpine Macro, told CNBC.But there are hurdles the project will have to overcome. \"Building in the Arctic is capital intensive; construction seasons are short, and the heat from the servers can melt the very ground the building sits on... specialized engineering is needed,\" Ramos said.Nvidia is also touting a new generation of chips that require less cooling. \"It's early days, but if future generations of chips are even more efficient in this regard, it could negate the need for expensive data centre build outs in places like Greenland,\" Michael Field, chief equity strategist at Morningstar, told CNBC.watch now",

Kent Nishimura | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesThe House of Representatives on Thursday passed the final set of outstanding government funding bills as a partial federal government shutdown looms on Jan. 30.The four bills account for the largest chunk of government spending, about $1.2 trillion in total. They would fund the departments of Defense; Health and Human Services; Homeland Security; Labor; Housing and Urban Development; Transportation; and Education. The Homeland Security bill passed 220-207, while the other three cleared 341-88 as part of a package known as a \"minibus.\"The bills represent the final quartet of 12 annual appropriations bills required to fund the government and avoid a partial shutdown on Jan. 30. The Senate still needs to approve them, along with two other House-passed funding bills, before they head to President Donald Trump's desk for a signature. The Senate does not return until next week, and a winter storm closing in on Washington over the weekend threatens to complicate those plans. House lawmakers were widely expected to pass the bills on Thursday, with lawmakers desperate to avoid another shutdown after enduring a record 43-day shutdown last year. Despite bipartisan accord on avoiding another shutdown, some of the bills still face serious hurdles in the Senate.

The Homeland bill was being considered separately from the other three bills in the House due to the political peril. Meanwhile, Republicans from the Midwest demanded a provision be added to the spending package to allow year-round sale of gasoline with a heavy mix of ethanol, known as E15. The fuel is currently restricted in the summer months due to smog concerns, though that restriction is frequently waived.House Republican leadership agreed to create a congressional \"E-15 Rural Domestic Energy Council\" instead to assuage those Republicans.Trump told Fox Business on Thursday that he \"think[s] we're going to probably end up in another Democrat shutdown,\" but did not specify whether he was referring to the deadline at the end of this month.

    "body": "Walmart Inc. signage during the company's listing at the Nasdaq MarketSite in New York, US, on Tuesday, Dec. 9, 2025. Michael Nagle | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesEstee Lauder sued Walmart in California federal court over allegations the big-box retailer sold counterfeit beauty products on its website and didn't do enough to ensure only authorized and authentic merchandise was offered to consumers. Estee Lauder said it purchased, inspected or tested a number of products sold on Walmart.com that used  the Le Labo, La Mer, Clinique, Aveda, Tom Ford and Estee Lauder trademarks but were determined to be fakes, according to the suit, filed Monday. The products include counterfeit versions of Estee Lauder's Advanced Night Repair serum, a Le Labo fragrance, a Clinique eye cream, a La Mer lotion, an Aveda hair brush and a Tom Ford fragrance. xemplars of the Estée Lauder Accused ProductsU.S. District Court ComplaintIt's unclear when Estee Lauder bought and tested the products but the suit comes several months after CNBC published an investigation into counterfeit beauty products and fraud on Walmart.com. Two of the counterfeit products cited in CNBC's investigation — Estee Lauder Advanced Night Repair serum and Clinique Smart Clinical Repair Wrinkle Correcting Eye Cream — were also mentioned in Estee Lauder's lawsuit. It's unclear if the products cited in the suit are the same counterfeits CNBC provided to Estee Lauder. Estee Lauder and Walmart didn't immediately return requests for comment. Exemplars of the Clinique Accused ProductsU.S. District Court ComplaintWhile the products were sold by third-party sellers on Walmart's online marketplace, Estee Lauder said the company played an active role in facilitating those sales to shoppers in its suit. The legacy beauty company called Walmart's conduct \"extreme, outrageous, fraudulent … despicable and harmful.\" The counterfeit products were promoted and advertised to shoppers on the platform, Estee Lauder's trademarks were used in search engine optimization tools to drive traffic to the listings and Walmart profited from the sales, the complaint stated. Further, \"a person shopping on Walmart.com would have reasonably believed that Walmart, and not third-party sellers, was the seller\" of the item, which could have caused confusion among shoppers, the complaint states. At the heart of CNBC's investigation into Walmart's online marketplace was the steps the company took, or didn't take, to vet its third-party sellers and the products they were offering to prevent fraud and the sale of fakes on the platform. Exemplars of the La Mer Accused Products.U.S. District Court ComplaintIn its complaint, Estee Lauder said Walmart promoted the \"reputation and professionalism\" of the sellers permitted to operate on the platform but said the retailer actually does \"very little to ensure that only authorized and authentic products are available\" for sale. \"This is readily apparent given the [counterfeits] were permitted to be sold on Defendants' website despite their stated careful selection process in who they choose as a Marketplace seller/partner,\" the complaint states. \"Accordingly, Defendants know or had reason to know that the sellers they partnered with and 'regularly review[ed]' were selling products which infringe upon the Estée Lauder Marks.\" Walmart's online marketplace has become a key part of its strategy to grow profit faster than sales and better compete against its longtime rival, Amazon. The rapid growth of the online platform helped fuel Walmart's ascent to a $1 trillion market cap last week, putting it in an exclusive club made up almost entirely of technology companies. However, the strategy has come with risks, CNBC's investigation revealed. Offering counterfeit, potentially dangerous, products to shoppers through third-party sellers on the marketplace opens Walmart up to liability and could erode the customer trust at the core of its brand. Exemplars of the Le Labo Accused ProductsU.S. District Court ComplaintEver since a 2010 court ruling that arose after Tiffany sued eBay over counterfeit products on the platform, it can be tough for brands to hold platforms accountable for their role in selling counterfeit goods. Sometimes, they avoid lawsuits unless the conduct is extreme or particularly flagrant, experts previously told CNBC.The Shop Safe Act, a bipartisan federal bill that aims to curb the sale of fakes on online marketplaces, is designed to address some of the issues posed by the Tiffany v. eBay ruling by incentivizing platforms to better vet sellers and the products they're offering. When platforms comply with certain anti-counterfeiting measures, they could be shielded from liability if a seller offers a fake product. Brands widely supported the legislation, but it has so far failed to pass at least three times. That's partially because Walmart and other online marketplaces like Amazon, Etsy and eBay have lobbied against aspects of it, two U.S. Senate aides, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the discussions were private, previously told CNBC. ",

    "body": "Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard speaks on the phone while standing at the edge of a truck loading bay after the FBI executed a search warrant for the Fulton County Election Hub and Operation Center in relation to the 2020 election, according to a law enforcement official familiar with the matter, in Union City, Georgia, Jan. 28, 2026.Elijah Nouvelage | ReutersA referral by former Trump campaign lawyer Kurt Olsen led to the recent FBI raid that seized 2020 election ballots from a Fulton County, Georgia, elections center, a newly unsealed federal court document revealed Tuesday.The document, an affidavit by FBI Special Agent Hugh Raymond Evans, said that the FBI is conducting a \"criminal investigation into whether any of the improprieties\" alleged to have occurred in voting processes and ballot counting in Fulton County in 2020 \"were intentional acts that violated federal criminal laws.\"\"The FBI criminal investigation originated from a referral sent by Kurt Olsen, Presidentially appointed Director of Election Security and Integrity,\" the affidavit document in U.S. District Court in Atlanta says.Olsen worked on efforts after the 2020 election to overturn President Donald Trump's loss in that contest to former President Joe Biden.Evans' affidavit was submitted by federal prosecutors as part of an application asking a federal magistrate judge to sign a search warrant for the election center. Olsen reportedly was hired last fall to investigate election issues.The affidavit was ordered unsealed by Atlanta federal court Judge J.P. Boulee, who was nominated by Trump, after the chairman of the Fulton County Board of Commissioners and county Board of Registration and Elections sued the federal government over the seizure of the ballots and sought their return.Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard was present at the election center on Jan. 28 when FBI agents raided the site and seized ballots.Gabbard's presence and the raid itself have been strongly criticized by Democratic lawmakers and others concerned that President Donald Trump is undercutting confidence in the upcoming midterm elections while resurrecting long-discredited claims that he actually won the 2020 presidential election in Georgia.Gabbard has said was at the election center at the direction of Trump. The president, in turn, has said that Gabbard was there at the \"insistence\" of Attorney General Pam Bondi.The warrant signed by the magistrate judge authorized the FBI to seize all physical ballots from the 2020 general election in Fulton County, including absentee ballots; tabulator tapes for every voting machine; and the vote rolls from the county.The affidavit signed by Evans, the FBI agent, says, \"Following the November 3, 2020, presidential election, there were many allegations of electoral impropriety relating to the voting process and ballot counting in Fulton County, Georgia.\"\"Some of those allegations have been disproven while some of those allegations have been substantiated, including through admissions by Fulton County,\" Evans wrote.The agent said the investigation is focused on several \"deficiencies or defects with the\" 2020 election and tabulation of votes.\"The tabulator machines used by Fulton County are designed to create and save a scanned image of each ballot,\" Evans wrote. \"Fulton County has admitted that it does not have scanned images of all the 528,777 ballots counted during the Original Count or the 527,925 ballots counted during the Recount.\"\"Fulton County has confirmed that during the Recount of votes, some ballots were scanned multiple times,\" the agent wrote. \"Ballot images made available in response to public record requests show ballots with unique markings duplicated within the ballot images.\"Evans also said that auditors who counted votes by hand reported vote tallies that were inconsistent with the actual number of votes within a batch, and that Fulton County reported two different vote tallies on the deadline to report recount results and on the subsequent day.\"If these deficiencies were the result of intentional action, it would be a violation of federal law regardless of whether the failure to retain records or the deprivation of a fair tabulation of a vote was outcome determinative for any particular election or race,\" the affidavit said.",

The platform allows users to buy event contracts for outcomes in politics, pop culture, financial markets and sports.\"It was an incredible weekend,\" Mansour told CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" on Tuesday. \"Kalshi was the biggest brand of the Super Bowl this year, without running a Super Bowl ad, and the way we achieved that is the product.\"Mansour said the trading volume for halftime performer Bad Bunny's opening song exceeded $100 million, while bets on who would perform with Bad Bunny surpassed $45 million. The platform's Super Bowl contracts were not without bumps, though. Co-founder Luana Lopes Lara posted on social media during the game that some users' deposits were delayed due to high traffic.\"Your money is safe and on the way, it will just take longer to land,\" she wrote. Kalshi has recently come under fire along with other prediction markets as skepticism around the industry builds, with concerns of insider trading.

We were on family vacation,\" he said.The secretary's admission came as he faces bipartisan calls to resign following the release of records showing that his business and personal relationship with Epstein was more extensive than previously known.U.S. Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick testifies during a Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies hearing on February 10, 2026 in Washington, DC. Lutnick is facing bipartisan calls for his resignation after revelations that came to light in the latest release of Epstein files. Chip Somodevilla | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesLutnick previously said that he cut off contact with Epstein after 2005 — years before Epstein pleaded guilty in 2008 to a state-level charge of soliciting a minor for prostitution, which required him to register as a sex offender.But analyses of the latest batch of Epstein files released by the Department of Justice show Lutnick and Epstein were in communication years later.In December 2012, Epstein invited Lutnick to lunch on his private island in the U.S. Virgin Islands, the documents showed. The two men also had business dealings as recently as 2014, CBS News reported.Epstein died by suicide in jail in 2019 while facing federal sex trafficking charges.The White House expressed confidence in Lutnick Monday after multiple lawmakers, including Republican Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky, demanded his ouster.Following Lutnick's testimony Tuesday, press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters at a White House briefing that President Donald Trump continues to stand behind his Commerce chief.In his testimony Tuesday morning before the Appropriations panel's subcommittee on commerce, justice, science and related agencies, Lutnick insisted that he \"barely had anything to do with that person.\"\"I'm glad to be here to make it clear that I met Jeffrey Epstein when he moved, when I moved to a house next door to him in New York,\" the Cabinet secretary testified.\"Over the next 14 years, I met him two other times that I can recall, two times,\" Lutnick said. \"So six years later, I met him, and then a year and a half after that, I met him, and never again.\"\"Probably the total — and you've seen all of these documents, of these millions and millions of documents — there may be 10 emails connecting me with him. ... Over a 14-year period.\"\"I did not have any relationship with him,\" Lutnick said.Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., the subcommittee's ranking member, replied, \"There's not an indication that you yourself engaged in any wrongdoing with Jeffrey Epstein. It's the fact that you ... misled the country and the Congress based on your earlier statements suggesting that you cut off all contact, when, in fact, you had not.\"Asked by Van Hollen if he saw anything inappropriate during his visit to the island, Lutnick said that he did not.\"The only thing I saw with my wife and my children and the other couple and their children was staff who worked for Mr. Epstein on that island,\" he testified.Van Hollen asked if Lutnick would commit to sharing with Congress his own records relating to Epstein in order to \"ensure that the file is complete.\"\"I will surely talk about that. Hadn't thought about that,\" Lutnick said, adding, \"I have nothing to hide. Absolutely nothing.\"",

A measure known as the \"control group\" of sales that excludes a number of items and feeds directly into gross domestic product calculations showed a 0.1% drop for the month.The report puts a downbeat end to an otherwise solid year for shopping activity, with higher-end consumers spending briskly through much of 2025, though those on the lower end of the income spectrum were more cautious.The shopping pace failed to keep up with inflation, as the consumer price index for December posted a 2.7% increase.For December, multiple categories posted losses while only a few showed notable gains.watch nowMiscellaneous retailers and furniture stores posted declines of 0.9%, while clothing and accessories stores were off 0.7%, and electronics and appliances saw a drop of 0.4%. Online outlets sales rose just 0.1%, while building materials and garden centers saw the strongest gain, up 1.2%.\"This is a K-shaped economy with strong spending from the top and much more cautious spending from middle- and lower-income consumers,\" said Heather Long, chief economist at Navy Federal Credit Union. \"Retail sales were flat in December, driven by soft spending on autos, home furnishings, appliances and clothing. These items were hard hit by tariffs in 2025 and consumers shifted their spending elsewhere.\"Fourth-quarter economic activity otherwise was strong, with the Atlanta Federal Reserve's data tracker pointing to GDP rising at a 4.2% annualized pace. However, that number could be lowered Tuesday following the retail number. Consumer spending makes up more than two-thirds of all economic activity in the U.S.The report comes a day ahead of the closely watched nonfarm payrolls count for January. Economists expect that to show an increase of just 55,000, following the 50,000 gain in December. However, several prominent Wall Street firms say they are looking for a lower number, with annual revisions due out that also are expected to shrink previous payroll growth.In other economic news Tuesday, the employment cost index posted a seasonally adjusted 0.7% increase for the fourth quarter of 2025, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, below the 0.8% forecast. For the year, total compensation costs rose 3.4%, or a bit above the inflation rate. The quarterly rate was the slowest gain since Q3 of 2020.The BLS also reported that import prices rose 0.1% in December, against a forecast decrease of 0.1%, and were unchanged from a year ago. Export prices increased 0.3% and were up 3.1% annually.",

Michael M. Santiago | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesThe world's largest YouTuber by subscriber count, Jimmy Donaldson, better known as MrBeast, has acquired the financial services app Step, marking his company's entry into fintech with a focus on serving younger users.Step is advertised as an all-in-one money app for teens and young adults to manage money, build credit and access financial tools. The app will operate under the umbrella of Donalson's company, Beast Industries. \"Nobody taught me about investing, building credit, or managing money when I was growing up. That's exactly why we're joining forces with Step,\" MrBeast told his millions of fans on Monday. \"I want to give millions of young people the financial foundation I never had. Lots to share soon.\"Beast Industries did not disclose how much it paid for Step. CNBC contacted the company for comment but did not receive a response by publication.Beast Industries has been fundraising over the past year, including a recent $200 million investment from Bitmine Immersion Technologies, the largest corporate holder of the cryptocurrency Ether and chaired by Fundstrat's Tom Lee.watch nowStep is backed by fintech giant Stripe, as well as venture capital firms such as Coatue, Collaborative Fund, Crosslink Capital and General Catalyst.The newly acquired Step was founded in 2018 by fintech veterans CJ MacDonald and Alexey Kalinichenko, with a mission of providing the next generation with tools for financial literacy. While it is not a bank, Step partnered with Evolve Bank & Trust, a consumer banking company, for banking services in 2022. The platform also includes a Step Visa Card, an account for saving, spending, sending money and investing, with no monthly fees.Beast Industries said in a press release Step's over 7 million users, technology platform and in-house fintech team would complement its large digital audience and philanthropic initiatives.\"This acquisition positions us to meet our audiences where they are, with practical, technology-driven solutions that can transform their financial futures for the better,\" Jeff Housenbold, CEO of Beast Industries, said in a statement. Beast Industries' other ventures include Feastables, a snack brand, Beast Philanthropy, its non-profit arm, and Beast Games, its reality competition series on Amazon Prime Video.Those ventures leverage Donaldson's YouTube brand, which had over 450 million subscribers and 5 billion monthly views across channels as of early 2026. ",

    "body": "A pedestrian walks by a CVS store in Greenbrae, California, on July 31, 2025.Justin Sullivan | Getty ImagesCVS Health on Tuesday reported fourth-quarter earnings and revenue that beat estimates and reaffirmed the 2026 profit guidance that impressed investors, signaling steady progress in the health-care giant's turnaround plan. \"'24 was a tough year for the company. So '25 righted the ship,\" CVS CFO Brian Newman said in an interview. CVS, which operates one of the largest pharmacy chains in the U.S., sees full-year profit coming in between $7 to $7.20 per share. That's in line with the $7.17 per share that analysts were expecting, according to LSEG. Newman also said the company is maintaining its 2026 revenue guidance of at least $400 billion. Analysts expect revenue of $409.77 billion, according to LSEG, though it's unclear if those estimates account for all of the headwinds Newman cited. He said that guidance includes $20 billion in headwinds, roughly half of which is driven by the company's move to exit the Affordable Care Act individual exchange market this year. Newman said the other half reflects the company's retail business adjusting to lower drug prices after the \"most-favored-nation\" deals that President Donald Trump struck with more than a dozen pharma companies in recent months. CVS last week said its more than 9,000 pharmacies are accepting discount cards from the president's newly launched direct-to-consumer platform, TrumpRx, for eligible patients. Newman said CVS shares the Trump administration's goal of reducing costs. He added that the lower prices set a new starting point from which Caremark, the company's pharmacy benefit manager, can negotiate even lower costs for its clients, \"so we don't see these as kind of adversarial relationships.\" CVS previously said it expects growth this year to be driven by the return to target margins at its recovering Aetna insurance business, led by privately run Medicare Advantage plans, and Caremark. Newman added that primary-care provider Oak Street Health is \"improving its profitability\" this year. That comes after CVS moved to close 16 underperforming Oak Street locations. For the retail pharmacy business, Newman said the company has several tail winds, such as new technological investments and the locations and new customers CVS acquired from Rite Aid last year after it filed for bankruptcy. Investors rewarded CVS last year as CEO David Joyner, who stepped into the role in late 2024, pressed ahead with a sweeping restructuring aimed at reversing years of underperformance. The company has cut costs, reshuffled leadership and exited weaker markets, helping fuel a roughly 40% stock rise over the past year.Here's what CVS reported for the fourth quarter compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG: Earnings per share: $1.09 adjusted vs. 99 cents expectedRevenue: $105.69 billion vs. $103.59 billion expectedThe company posted net income of $2.92 billion, or $2.30 per share, for the fourth quarter. That compares with net income of $1.62 billion, or $1.30 cents per share, for the same period a year ago. Excluding certain items, such as restructuring charges and capital losses, adjusted earnings were $1.09 per share for the quarter.CVS booked sales of $105.69 billion for the fourth quarter, up 8.2% from the same period a year ago, as all three of its business segments showed growth. Growth across business unitsThe insurance business brought in $36.29 billion in revenue during the quarter, up more than 10% from the fourth quarter of 2024. Newman said that the unit delivered a \"very strong\" quarter and that he expects another year of margin improvement, primarily driven by Medicare Advantage. The company's business for those privately run Medicare plans is \"continuing the path towards target margins\" of 3% to 4% by 2028, he said. Aetna and other insurers have grappled with higher-than-expected medical costs over the past year as more Medicare Advantage patients return to hospitals for procedures they delayed during the pandemic. While medical costs remain high, Aetna and other insurers, such as UnitedHealthcare, appear to be becoming better equipped to navigate the issue moving forward.Still, Newman said, \"we will continue the elevated trends. ... I don't think it's too early to assume anything other than a prudent outlook.\"The insurance segment's medical benefit ratio — a measure of total medical expenses paid relative to premiums collected — remained consistent from the prior year, at 94.8%. A lower ratio typically indicates that a company collected more in premiums than it paid out in benefits, resulting in higher profitability.Newman said the biggest driver of that ratio in the fourth quarter was Medicaid pass-through payments that hit in late December. In a release, CVS also said improved performance in the unit's government business was offset by shifts in Medicare drug cost timing following changes under the Inflation Reduction Act, which altered the usual seasonal pattern of prescription spending.More CNBC health coverageThe Trump administration is changing Covid, childhood vaccine recommendations – here's what it means for youU.S. to impose 100% tariff on branded, patented drugs unless firms build plants locally, Trump saysEli Lilly to build $6.5 billion Texas manufacturing facility for obesity pill, other drugsLast month, shares of Medicare Advantage insurers took a hit after the Trump administration proposed nearly flat government payment rates to those plans in 2027. Newman said he does not believe that the proposed rate reflects medical cost trends. CVS has started a dialogue with the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services before the agency finalizes the rate notice in the beginning of April, he added. CVS' pharmacy and consumer wellness division posted $37.66 billion in sales for the fourth quarter, up 12.4% from the same period a year earlier.CVS said the increase came partly from higher prescription volume, including from the company's acquisition of prescriptions from Rite Aid, but was offset by pharmacy reimbursement pressure and the impact of some generic drugs entering the market. That unit dispenses prescriptions in CVS' more than 9,000 retail pharmacies and provides other services, such as vaccinations and diagnostic testing.CVS' health services segment generated $51.24 billion in revenue for the quarter, up 9% compared with the same quarter in 2024. That unit includes Caremark, which negotiates drug discounts with manufacturers on behalf of insurance plans, creates lists of medications, or formularies, that are covered by insurance, and reimburses pharmacies for prescriptions.",

    "body": "A 'now hiring' sign is displayed in a business's window in Manhattan on Jan. 9, 2026, in New York City.Spencer Platt | Getty ImagesThe jobs report Wednesday could resemble a big nothing, in more ways than one.Economists expect that January's nonfarm payrolls report will show growth that was nil or not much better during the month. On top of that, annual revisions also could reveal that the U.S. economy going back to early 2024 had generated few if any net jobs, casting further doubt on the health of the labor market.\"I think zero would be the forecast,\" said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics. \"The consensus is probably around 50,000. Anything around zero just shows you how fragile things are, just very weak. This is all happening with no layoffs, but layoffs are going to pick up. I think we could get job losses here pretty soon.\"The payrolls report will be released at 8:30 a.m. ET. It was delayed five days due to the brief government shutdown.watch nowOfficially, the Dow Jones consensus forecast is calling for payroll gains of 55,000, a number that has been trending lower and would come after a December increase of 50,000. That is expected to be good enough to keep the unemployment rate at a still-low 4.4%, with annual wage gains of 3.7%.However, a number of Wall Street economists are predicting a below-forecast number. Goldman Sachs, for instance, expects an increase of just 45,000. On the other side, Citigroup is projecting a gain of 135,000, but one that it attributes to seasonal distortions, with \"appropriately adjusted payroll growth ... closer to zero.\"Wiping out previous gainsThen there are the revisions, a nettlesome problem for the Bureau of Labor Statistics as it struggles to get timely and relevant data. Last September, the BLS estimated in its preliminary adjustment that benchmark revisions for the year prior to March 2025 would show 911,000 fewer jobs than previously reported, or about half the total. The bureau will report the final number Wednesday, with expectations that the final count will be less than that but still significant. Goldman, for instance, estimated the number to be between 750,000-900,000, while Fed Chair Jerome Powell said a few weeks ago that it could be closer to 600,000. Every month of 2025 reported so far has seen downward revisions, taking initially reported estimates down by 624,000 and leaving average monthly payroll gains of less than 40,000. Wednesday's report will feature the first revision for December's count. The BLS also is adjusting the model it uses to estimate jobs created by businesses opening and closing during the month, which also could play with the numbers.In any event, the revisions will show a stumbling labor market that likely will get further attention from Powell and his colleagues as they plot their next policy move.Lowering expectationsEven White House officials have been spending time this week trying to tamp down expectations.Kevin Hassett, the National Economic Council director who was a finalist to become the next Federal Reserve chair, told CNBC that several factors are converging to keep payroll growth low, at least for the time being.Primary among them is the administration's efforts to tackle illegal immigration. Hassett also cited rising productivity stemming from artificial intelligence improvements that is restraining businesses' need to hire.\"I think that you should expect slightly smaller job numbers that are consistent with high GDP growth right now. ... One shouldn't panic if you see a sequence of numbers that are lower than you're used to,\" he said Monday. \"Because, again, population growth is going down and productivity growth is skyrocketing. It's an unusual set of circumstances.\"Hassett added that there could be a scenario where \"job creation lags, productivity skyrockets, profits skyrocket, GDP skyrockets.\" watch nowThere have been other signs of labor market deterioration lately.Job openings plunged in December to their lowest level since September 2020, according to the BLS. At the same time, planned layoffs and hires both had their worst January since the global financial crisis in 2009, Challenger, Gray & Christmas reported. Also, ADP reported private hiring of just 22,000 in January. On the bright side, Homebase reported that small businesses added jobs at a 3.3% rate last month, better than the 3.1% level in January 2025 and well above the 1.3% for the same month in 2024.From the Fed's perspective, policymakers look at employment trends over a period and not a month at a time. Most officials are expecting slowing hiring coupled with a low level of layoffs that, rather than suggesting a material weakening, point more to stabilization. In speeches Tuesday, regional Presidents Lorie Logan of Dallas and Beth Hammack of Cleveland both said they think the economy is progressing well but are more worried about inflation than unemployment. They also cast doubt on the need for further interest rate cuts.\"Rather than trying to fine-tune the funds rate, I'd prefer to err on the side of patience as we assess the impact of recent rate reductions and monitor how the economy performs,\" Hammack said. \"Based on my forecast, we could be on hold for quite some time.\"",

Ron Johnson, R-Wis., on Tuesday slammed Democrats for conditioning Homeland Security Department funding on a requirement that federal immigration agents must obtain judicial warrants to carry out key enforcement activities.Johnson, in an interview on CNBC's \"Squawk Box,\" called that proposal \"completely unworkable.\" But it's Democrats' top demand for funding DHS, which is set to lose funding by the week's end if Congress can't pass an appropriations bill.Johnson said he hopes Congress can pass another stopgap measure to buy time, but suggested Democrats have been unreasonable in negotiations so far.\"They want to defund DHS just like they want to defund police,\" Johnson said of his political opponents. DHS includes the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency, whose deportation efforts have grown especially controversial after an aggressive surge in Minnesota stirred national unrest.Democrats \"want to make it almost impossible for ICE to do its job,\" Johnson, a member of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, said.\"Of the 10 demands, probably the most obnoxious is they want to require judicial warrants, which is completely unworkable,\" he said. \"Our immigration laws have always been enforced by the executive branch, through administrative law judges. We have, again, literally millions of cases that need to be adjudicated. Our Article Three courts simply can't handle that, and Democrats know it,\" Johnson said.Democrats have rejected arguments that requiring judge-signed warrants to enter private property — as opposed to administrative warrants issued by federal agency officials — would overburden the system.The White House sent a counterproposal to Democrats' demands, but Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., in a statement late Monday called it \"incomplete and insufficient.\"Johnson also defended ICE agents wearing masks and obscuring their faces, accusing Democrats of wanting extreme political activists to \"dox\" agents.\"Democrats want to make sure that ICE can't use masks. Why is that? Because they want their activists to be able to dox them and put their families at risk.\"He warned that a shutdown would cause real harm, noting that the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the Transportation Security Administration would be defunded if DHS appropriations lapsed. Other parts of the department are already funded through previous legislation.\"They're really playing with fire here,\" Johnson said.",

    "body": "Trowbridge in Somerset, England, on March 15, 2025.Anna Barclay | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesBritish oil giant BP on Tuesday posted fourth-quarter profit in line with expectations and suspended share buybacks, seeking to shore up its balance sheet as lower crude prices take their toll.The London-listed energy firm reported underlying replacement cost profit, used as a proxy for net profit, of $1.54 billion for the final three months of 2025. That matched analyst expectations of $1.54 billion, according to an LSEG-compiled consensus.BP's full-year 2025 net profit came in at $7.49 billion, missing analyst expectations of $7.58 billion. That's down from nearly $9 billion in 2024. BP said the board decided to suspend the share buyback and fully allocate excess cash \"to accelerate strengthening\" of its balance sheet. The firm's previous buyback was $750 million and was announced alongside third-quarter results in November.  For the fourth quarter, the company announced a dividend per ordinary share of 8.320 cents.\"2025 was a year of strong underlying financial results, strong operational performance, and meaningful strategic progress,\" Carol Howle, BP interim CEO, said in a statement.\"We have made progress against our four primary targets - growing cash flow and returns, reducing costs, and strengthening the balance sheet - but know there is more work to be done, and we are clear on the urgency to deliver,\" she added.Woodside Energy boss Meg O'Neill is scheduled to take the reins at BP on April 1, following Murray Auchincloss' decision to step down late last year.Shares of BP fell nearly 4% during early afternoon deals, paring some of its losses from earlier in the session.Some other earnings highlights included:BP's fourth-quarter net debt came in at $22.18 billion, down from around $23 billion in the same period last year.Fourth-quarter operating cash flow came in at $7.6 billion, up from $7.43 billion a year ago.BP set its 2026 capital expenditure budget at $13 billion to $13.5 billion, reflecting the lower end of its guidance range. The results come at a tough time for Europe's oil and gas sector. Oil prices notched their biggest annual loss since the Covid-19 pandemic last year, partly due to oversupply concerns, ratcheting up the pressure on Big Oil's commitment to shareholder returns. BP's industry rivals Equinor and Shell both reported weaker quarterly earnings last week, citing lower crude prices, among other factors.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconBP, Equinor and Shell shares year-to-dateEquinor announced it would reduce share buybacks to $1.5 billion this year, down from $5 billion last year, while also trimming investments in its renewables and low-emission energy projects. Shell, for its part, kept its buybacks steady at $3.5 billion, a move that marked the firm's 17th consecutive quarter of $3 billion or more in buybacks.BP's decision to pause its share buybacks should be seen as a prudent step to prioritize balance sheet strength in a softer commodity price environment, according to Maurizio Carulli, global energy analyst at Quilter Cheviot.\"Under former CEO Murray Auchincloss's 'strategy reset' last April, buybacks had already been reduced from $1.75bn per quarter to $750m. The decision to cancel them entirely signals a more cautious stance and a clear focus on financial resilience,\" Carulli \"While the move was not a complete surprise to the market, particularly after similar actions by other oil majors, some shorter-term investors may be disappointed, which helps explain the share price weakness seen today. However, prioritising balance sheet strength in a softer commodity price environment is a prudent step.watch now",

    "body": "watch nowHouse lawmakers on Monday approved a package of bills aimed at increasing housing affordability by giving builders and local governments incentives to boost construction by reducing regulations around home construction. The legislation gained strong bipartisan support, with the House voting 390-9 in favor. A similar Senate counterpart passed last year, also with bipartisan votes. That, as well as President Donald Trump's focus on housing affordability, means the measure has momentum to become law before the end of the year. \"Nothing's more personal to Americans than their opportunity to have a home,\" Rep. Mike Flood, R-Neb., told reporters on Monday. \"When you ask people what is central to their goals in life, mom and dad are working 55 hours a week and overtime and all these other things ... the idea is, how do we get into a house?\"The bill includes numerous provisions, including cutting housing and environmental regulations around constructing homes. Local communities could get grants to make it easier for builders by offering pre-reviewed housing designs, streamlining construction or housing. The Department of Housing and Urban Development would also develop best-practices for zoning guidelines. Definitions around manufactured and modular housing would be updated to encourage more factory-built homes, which can be constructed in a fraction of the time compared to more traditional house-building methods.Community banks would also get a boost through the bill. One change would allow banks to take more custodial and reciprocal deposits, which could help banks provide more mortgages for potential homeowners. Other changes would make it easier to start new banks and change how the FDIC looks at banking mergers. The Senate bill doesn't include many of the provisions on community banks, and would create more programs compared to the House bill. The Senate passed its package last year as part of a larger defense measure, but the bill got significant bipartisan support as a standalone measure, including the backing of both Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Chair Tim Scott, R-S.C., and the top Democrat on the committee, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass.The bills have received an unusually high degree of bipartisan support. The Senate bill was advanced unanimously out of committee with all 24 senators supporting it. A House panel advanced its bill 50 to 1 in December.Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., who supported the bill, warned the legislation wouldn't be effective if housing programs remain underfunded.\"Policy reforms alone are not enough,\" Waters said. \"These programs must be funded if they are going to work.\"House Financial Services Chair French Hill, R-Ark., said getting a housing bill across the finish line is a \"shared goal\" between him and Scott. Hill said he will work with the Senate to see where they have common ground and get consensus on a bill that can get to Trump's desk. Flood said he is optimistic on getting passage this year. \"We are at a juncture to get something very big done here, and everybody wants to participate,\" he said. \"This isn't like we're pushing an agenda trying to talk people into something. White House has ideas. The Senate has ideas. The House has ideas.\"One thing not in the bill: formalizing Trump's proposed ban on large investors buying homes. Hill noted other lawmakers have introduced bills building on Trump's idea and said it could happen if there is a consensus in the Senate and House. ",

    "body": "watch nowCoca-Cola on Tuesday reported weaker-than-expected quarterly revenue, falling short of Wall Street's projections for the first time in five years.However, demand for its drinks in North America and Latin America is beginning to show signs of improvement.Looking ahead to 2026, the company is projecting organic revenue growth of 4% to 5% and comparable earnings per share growth of 7% to 8% for the full year.\"It's right at the beginning of the year, and I think we've taken a realistic and prudent approach to a number of markets out there, particularly some of the international markets where we want to see conditions improve, and we need to do some things to execute better,\" outgoing CEO James Quincey said on CNBC's \"Squawk on the Street.\"Here's what the company reported for the period ended Dec. 31 compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:Adjusted earnings per share: 58 cents vs. 56 cents expectedAdjusted revenue: $11.82 billion vs. $12.03 billion expected The beverage giant reported fourth-quarter net income attributable to shareholders of $2.27 billion, or 53 cents per share, up from $2.2 billion, or 51 cents per share, a year earlier.Excluding transaction gains and other one-time items, Coke earned 58 cents per share.Net sales rose 2% to $11.82 billion. Organic revenue, which strips out acquisitions, divestitures and currency, increased 5% in the quarter.Unit case volume rose 1% in the quarter, marking the second straight quarter of growth for the company. The metric excludes the impact of pricing and foreign currency to reflect demand. Like rival PepsiCo, Coke has seen demand for its drinks fall as budget-conscious shoppers try to save more on their grocery bills and dine out less frequently. Coke's overall volume for 2025 was unchanged from the prior year. But there have been some bright spots, like Smartwater and Fairlife, showing that consumers are still willing to pay more for premium drinks. And two key markets for Coke are starting to show signs of improvement. Coke's volume in North America increased 1%, while it rose 2% in Latin America. Worldwide, Coke's water, sports, coffee and tea division outperformed the rest of its portfolio, signaling consumers' willingness to spend on drinks they perceive as healthier options. The segment saw volume grow 3%, thanks to higher demand for brands like Smartwater and Bodyarmor. The company's sparkling soft drinks business reported flat volume. Its namesake soda saw volume rise 1% in the quarter, while Coke Zero Sugar reported that its volume climbed 13%.Coke's juice, value-added dairy and plant-based beverages division reported that volume fell 3%. Higher demand for Fairlife was offset by the sale of Coke's finished product operations in Nigeria to one of its bottlers.CEO transitionTuesday marks Quincey's last earnings report as CEO. The company announced in December that Chief Operating Officer Henrique Braun will succeed him as chief executive, effective March 31.Braun said on the company's conference call Tuesday that he wants to improve Coke's speed when taking new products to market, better integrate its marketing where customers actually buy its drinks and continue efforts to digitize every step of its system.\"Our system needs to focus on being a little bit better and sharper everywhere to drive transformation and impact,\" Braun said.The company also plans to stay \"flexible and opportunistic\" when it comes to acquisitions, according to CFO John Murphy. While he noted that Coke's track record hasn't been perfect, he added that almost half of the company's 32 billion-dollar brands were the result of deal-making.Executives plan to share more about the company's future priorities during its Feb. 17 presentation at the annual CAGNY conference. As of Tuesday's open Coca-Cola shares have risen roughly 20% over the last year, raising its market value up to more than $330 billion.watch now",

    "body": "The sun sets behind burning gas flares at the Dora (Daura) Oil Refinery Complex in Baghdad on December 22, 2024.Ahmad Al-rubaye | Afp | Getty ImagesThe Environmental Protection Agency on Thursday will revoke a critical scientific finding that undergirds the U.S. government's climate regulations and ability to regulate greenhouse gases, the White House said.\"On Thursday, President Trump will be joined by Administrator Lee Zeldin to formalize the rescission of the 2009 Obama-era endangerment finding,\" White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters on Tuesday, referring to the EPA's leader. \"This will be the largest deregulatory action in American history, and it will save the American people $1.3 trillion in crushing regulations.\"The EPA took a key step to axe the 2009 \"endangerment finding\" over the weekend by submitting the proposed rule to the Office of Management and Budget, the EPA press office told CNBC earlier in the day. The agency initially proposed rescinding it in July last year. The revocation of the endangerment finding will represent the Trump administration's biggest broadside yet against efforts to combat climate change and would be a boon for the fossil fuel industry that has fought against climate regulations for years. The endangerment finding determined that greenhouse gases pose a risk to public health and welfare, giving EPA the authority to regulate them. Effectively, the EPA's move will immediately wipe away regulations on emissions from the country's highest polluting sector in transportation. Rescinding the endangerment finding, which was signed during the Obama administration and serves as the basis for troves of U.S. climate policy enacted since, will cause EPA to \"lack statutory authority under Section 202(a) of the Clean Air Act (CAA) to prescribe standards for certain motor vehicle emissions,\" the agency said. Since the ruling, the EPA has regulated emissions from automobiles and other vehicles and power plants. Its revocation would open the door to challenging those regulations.Rescinding the endangerment finding would almost certainly face legal challenges from environmental groups, and it could be legally tenuous. The endangerment finding has been upheld in court. In 2007, a Supreme Court decision, Massachusetts v. EPA, cleared the way for the finding to be made. The high court declined to hear an appeal challenging the endangerment finding as recently as 2023. The planned revocation met swift backlash on Capitol Hill from Democrats. \"Let's be very clear what this announcement represents: it is a corrupt giveaway to Big Oil, plain and simple,\" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said on Tuesday on the Senate floor. \"The blast radius of this reckless decision will span from San Diego to Portland, Maine and from Seattle to Miami.\"The status quo has supporters in industry as well.Elon Musk's electric vehicle company Tesla urged the administration to uphold the endangerment finding in a September letter to the EPA.\"The Endangerment Finding – and the vehicle emissions standards which flow from it – have provided a stable regulatory platform for Tesla's extensive investments in product development and production,\" Tesla wrote. \"Reversing the Endangerment Finding would also deprive consumers of choice and extensive economic benefits, have negative effects on human health, and further impact the integrated North American automotive sector.\"— CNBC's Lora Kolodny contributed to this report.

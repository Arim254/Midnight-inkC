    "body": "Issa Rae has a tried-and-true method to setting herself up for success, she says.The 41-year-old writer, actor, producer and entrepreneur categorically organizes her goals and ideas in a notebook at the beginning of the year, and revisits them six months later to check her progress, she tells CNBC Make It.Rae is often a busy woman. She co-created, co-wrote and starred in the HBO series \"Insecure,\" which premiered in 2016 and ended in 2021. She's acted in several movies, produced other films and TV shows, and launched several businesses, including production company Hoorae Media, Viarae Prosecco, haircare brand Sienna Naturals and Hilltop Coffee and Kitchen, a California-based coffee shop chain.New Year's Day is \"my superpower day,\" says Rae, who's set to additionally appear in a commercial for TurboTax during Super Bowl 60 on Sunday. \"That's when everything feels possible. Everything will get done. I look at the [old] notebooks, compile the ideas that I wrote down and decide what's attainable and what's achievable, and I will set those goals.\"DON'T MISS: How to build custom GPTs and use AI agentsRae jots down her personal and career goals separately, she says, and then writes out her resolutions. \"The resolutions I keep to three or four, and they're really general, like, 'read more,' 'be better.' But the career and personal ones are actually very specific.\" (Rae declined to share examples of those specific goals.)If Rae gets an idea for a goal or resolution during other times of the year, she makes a point of writing it down before she forgets, she says. \"The best ideas show up when I'm just chilling,\" she says. \"I always have a notebook near me.\"Rae refers to herself as \"not a good long-term thinker,\" and says that \"having a routine and being really, really intentional about what my goals are\" helps her stay disciplined. The value of writing down your goalsBusiness luminaries ranging from FUBU founder and CEO Daymond John, a longtime investor judge on ABC's \"Shark Tank,\" to billionaire Richard Branson have spoken about writing down their goals, too. The simple exercise can make achieving them easier, neuroscientists and psychologists say, helping you set a clear plan and better track your progress.You can even try replacing your bullet-point list of goals with writing a letter to yourself, neuroscientist and author Erin Clabough told CNBC Make It on Jan. 27. The exercise can help you instill a sense of motivation and self-belief that you might otherwise lack, she said.Writing yourself a letter is typically most effective when you set open-ended, big-picture goals, said Clabough. A statement like, \"I will embrace new, exciting experiences this year,\" might allow for more flexibility and satisfaction than something rigid and unadaptable like, \"I will travel to three countries this year.\"Then, once you've given yourself a directive, \"do the best that you can towards that intention, every day,\" Clabough said. \"You're going to make progress towards that, but sometimes it won't be in the way that you thought you were going to do it.\"Want to get ahead at work with AI?

We remain committed to the millions of Americans who depend on us for access to safe, affordable, and personalized care.\"Hims & Hers had previously said it planned to create a cheaper, copycat version of pharmaceutical giant Novo Nordisk's Wegovy weight-loss pill. That treatment — featuring Wegovy's active ingredient, semaglutide — was set to launch for as little as $49 for the first month. Novo's pill sells for roughly $100 more.Novo on Thursday threatened legal action against Hims for what it called \"illegal mass compounding,\" adding that the company planned to take legal and regulatory action. \"This is another example of Hims & Hers' historic behaviour of duping the American public with knock-off GLP-1 products, and the FDA has previously warned them about their deceptive advertising of GLP-1 knock-offs,\" Novo said in a statement at the time.On Friday, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration weighed in, announcing it planned to take legal action against Hims & Hers for the pill, including restricting access to the ingredients and referring the company to the Department of Justice.In response, Hims on Saturday said it \"has always operated with a deep commitment to the safety and best interests of consumers and in compliance with applicable law.\"The move comes as the company plans to run an advertisement during Super Bowl 60 on Sunday. The ad features rapper Common voicing the message that \"America's wealth gap has turned into a health gap.\" Hims previously said it expects the ad to \"ruffle some feathers.\"",

Photographer: Toru Hanai/Bloomberg via Getty ImagesBloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesJapan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party has likely strengthened its majority in the country's Lower House, with the LDP capturing between 274 and 328 in the 465 seat chamber, according to an early projection by broadcaster NHK. This was broadly in line with what polls had suggested, with Nikkei and Asahi Shimbun predicting that the LDP and its coalition partner, the Japan Innovation Party would secure more then 300 seats in the Lower House. NHK projected the coalition would win up to 366 seats.People trudged through heavy snow in several parts of the country to cast their votes.Before parliament was dissolved, the LDP-JIP coalition held a combined 230 seats, and with three independents voting with the LDP, this effectively gave the ruling coalition a one seat majority in the chamber. Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi, Japan's first female leader, dissolved the Lower House on Jan. 23, a move that was seen as an attempt to quickly strengthen the ruling coalition's position in the chamber by capitalizing on her high public approval ratings. \"Takaichi now has the LDP and the technocrats exactly where she always wanted them,\" economist Jesper Koll said in a Substack post.\"The LDP is now beholden to her; and the elite technocrats now know she'll be in power for at least two or three more years … so they have no choice but to invest their career in her success,\" Koll added.OSAKA, JAPAN - FEBRUARY 08: Election staff members count votes at a ballot counting center on February 08, 2026 in Osaka, Japan. Voters across the country headed to polls today as Japan's Lower House election was held.  (Photo by Buddhika Weerasinghe/Getty Images)Buddhika Weerasinghe | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesPolls compiled by Japanese media outlet Nippon.com showed that Takaichi remained popular heading into the election, although her support had slipped slightly in the recent weeks. The outlet reported that just one domestic poll in January indicated more than 70% support, compared to three in December, while six polls showed support in the 60% range, up from four in the previous month. Meanwhile, the Central Reform Alliance, made up of the former Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan and Komeito, the LDP's former coalition partner, was likely to pick up between 37 and 91 seats. The CDP was the largest opposition party before its merger with Komeito, holding 148 seats, while Komeito controlled 24 seats.Economic and geopolitical challengesThe election comes amid heightened tensions between Japan and China, as well as persistent concerns over the yen's weakness and inflation in the country.Japan has endured inflation above the Bank of Japan's target for 45 consecutive months, declining real wages and persistent yen weakness.The most recent inflation reading stood at 2.1%, while full-year inflation reached 3.2%. Real wages fell for 11 consecutive months year-on-year in 2025, and on a yearly basis, real wages have fallen every year since 2022.The yen weakened further at the start of 2026, briefly approaching the 160 level against the U.S. dollar. While a weaker currency benefits exporters, it has also amplified imported inflation.Takaichi had earlier laid out a record $783 billion budget for the next fiscal year starting April 1, on top of a $135 billion stimulus package introduced last year to help households with rising living costs.\"Watch for more state-directed initiatives to create 'national champions', levering the $550 [billion] U.S.-Japan investment deal to create a sense of urgency amongst reluctant CEOs,\" Koll said. \"Japan's M&A boom will get turbo-charged to create greater economies of scale, and thus more credible global competitiveness — all this in the name of higher national economic security.\" -- Azhar Sukri contributed to this storyStock Chart IconStock chart iconUSDJPY=",

    "body": "A Western Digital office building is shown in Irvine, California, U.S., January 24, 2017.Mike Blake | Reuters The latest earnings reports from major technology companies have revived investors' concerns about payoffs on elevated artificial intelligence (AI) spending. While some companies failed to impress investors, others proved their ability to capitalize on solid growth opportunities offered by the ongoing AI boom.With their expertise and in-depth analysis, top Wall Street analysts can help investors select stocks that can outperform the broader market and deliver impressive growth. Here are three stocks favored by some of Wall Street's top pros, according to TipRanks, a platform that ranks analysts based on their past performance.AppleiPhone maker Apple (AAPL) is this week's first pick. In a recent research note, Evercore analyst Amit Daryanani reiterated a buy rating on Apple stock with a price target of $330. TipRanks' AI Analyst is also bullish on AAPL stock, with an \"outperform\" rating and a price target of $289. The five-star analyst noted that Apple's January App Store revenue rose 7% year over year. However, Daryanani pointed out that Gaming revenues fell on a year-over-year basis for a third consecutive month, with January revenues down 3%. He explained that this weakness was due to tougher year-over-year comparisons. He expects Gaming revenues to see easier comparisons through the rest of the first half of calendar year 2026. Daryanani highlighted that despite ongoing weakness in the Gaming category, revenues from the other five categories of App Store revenue grew by double digits, led by Music (up 21%), Other (21%), Photo and Video (18%), Social Networking (11%) and Entertainment (10%).The analyst stated that Apple continues to deliver robust growth in Services revenue despite subdued App Store data, with the December quarter seeing 14% growth compared to the App Store's 6.5% growth. Daryanani also noted that Apple's recently reported revenue and EPS (earnings per share) for the December quarter exceeded expectations, with the company delivering better-than-expected gross margin, driven by limited memory impact and robust Services growth. \"We expect AAPL to continue to benefit from faster growing areas (Apple Pay, iCloud, Licensing, etc.), helping to offset <10% growth in App Store revs,\" said Daryanani. Daryanani ranks No. 160 among more than 12,000 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been profitable 64% of the time, delivering an average return of 20.6%. See Apple Options Activity on TipRanks. MongoDBDatabase software provider MongoDB (MDB) is next on the list. Bank of America analyst Koji Ikeda is optimistic about the company's growth prospects. He recently reaffirmed a buy rating on MDB stock and raised his price forecast to $500 from $480. TipRanks' AI Analyst has an \"outperform\" rating on MongoDB stock with a price target of $380. Commenting on concerns over whether MongoDB's Atlas revenue growth will keep accelerating, Ikeda sees the potential for continued strength. His optimism is backed by the success of the company's top-down enterprise and bottom-up product-led growth approach and an expanding product lineup for artificial intelligence (AI) and legacy app modernization. The analyst also expects MongoDB to gain from higher consumption, driven by rising enterprise workloads. Ikeda highlighted the strengths of MongoDB database, saying it is fast, scalable and document-based, differentiating it from conventional relational databases like Oracle. The five-star analyst also noted the new features offered by the company, including vector search and application modernization capabilities, which bolster its position to win additional workloads.While MDB stock is trading at a higher valuation compared to infrastructure software peers, Ikeda believes that a premium is justified, given the 30% Atlas growth compared to 11% for peers and MongoDB's leading position in the database market. Ikeda ranks No. 689 among more than 12,000 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been successful 57% of the time, delivering an average return of 11.7%. See MDB Ownership Structure on TipRanks.Western Digital Data storage company Western Digital (WDC) recently announced better-than-expected fiscal second-quarter results and issued solid guidance. The robust demand for hard drives and flash storage amid the ongoing AI wave is boosting the company's business. Following Western Digital's Innovation Day, Bank of America analyst Wamsi Mohan reaffirmed a buy rating on WDC stock with a price target of $345. TipRanks' AI Analyst has an \"outperform\" rating on Western Digital with a price target of $285. Mohan noted that Western Digital expects the AI and cloud storage market to grow exabytes (EB), a measure of data storage, at a CAGR (compound annual growth rate) of over 25% through 2030. The five-star analyst also sees the possibility of hard disk drives (HDDs) gaining market share and accounting for more than 80% of storage in the cloud. Additionally, Mohan emphasized Western Digital's revised long-term growth targets. Over the next three to five years, the company aims to grow its nearline exabytes at mid-20% CAGR, with overall revenue above 20% CAGR. Mohan highlighted that a favorable mix shift to higher capacity HDDs, stable pricing, and a focus on cost improvements could fuel gross margin above 50%, an operating margin of more than 40%, and EPS higher than $20. Meanwhile, Western Digital is planning capital spending at 4% to 6% of annual revenue and a free cash flow margin of more than 30%. Overall, Mohan is bullish on WDC's prospects based on \"secular growth of the HDD market,\" as well as further gross margin upside.Mohan ranks No. 110 among more than 12,000 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been successful 62% of the time, delivering an average return of 25.1%. See Western Digital Financials on TipRanks.",

    "description": "The Trump administration's portfolio of equity stakes in U.S. companies has reached a scale that is unprecedented outside economic crisis or wartime. ",
    "body": "The Trump administration's portfolio of equity stakes in U.S. companies has reached a scale that is unprecedented outside economic crisis or wartime. The administration has taken stakes or has agreements to do so with at least 10 companies, most of which are publicly traded. The government announced its latest investment, USA Rare Earth, at the end of January. Democrats have also considered taking stakes in U.S. industries in the past. But the Trump administration's approach carries risks both for the companies involved and for the broader markets in which they operate. \"It is a invisible barrier to startups and new market entrants,\" said Scott Lincicome, an international trade lawyer affiliated with Cato Institute. \"Why would you ever want to enter a market that you know your chief competitor is backed by the U.S. government?\" Many of the investments are in smaller critical mineral companies, like USA Rare Earth and MP Materials, but they also include big industrial and tech companies such as U.S. Steel and Intel. Top administration officials like Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and Interior Secretary Doug Burgum have argued that the U.S. government is investing in strategic industries to reduce dependence on Tawain in the case of semiconductors and China for critical minerals. Historically, the U.S. has taken equity stakes in companies in the context of bailouts with the understanding that the investments were temporary and the government would exit its position when the company was financially viable again, said Peter Harrell, who served as the senior director for international economics under President Joe Biden. President Barack Obama, for example, took a stake in General Motors during the 2008 financial crisis and President Franklin Roosevelt took stakes in the banking sector during the Great Depression. But the Trump administration appears to be taking open-ended ownership interest that the U.S. government is unlikely to exit, Lincicome said. It sets a precedent that future Democratic presidents could use to invest directly in their favored industries like wind and solar, he said. \"I have yet to see a clear, coherent reason for why equity stakes are needed,\" Lincicome said. Federal support that falls short of ownership stakes like loans, government contracts and other awards are widely available, he said.  After the U.S. took its stake in Intel, Lutnick told CNBC that President Donald Trump wants the American taxpayer to benefit when the government gives money to corporations.But the administration's approach creates political, legal and business risks for the companies involved, Harrell and Lincicome said. It also raises potential conflict of interest concerns, they said. CNBC has reached out to the White House for comment.Political, legal riskThe Trump administration's approach is a major ideological departure for the Republican Party, which has traditionally championed free market capitalism and excoriated government intervention. The Democrats have typically been the party of industrial policy and intervention in markets.Sen. Bernie Sanders and Sen. Elizabeth Warren, for example, introduced an amendment to Biden's CHIPS Act that would have allowed the government to take stakes in companies that accept federal funding for semiconductor manufacturing. The measure ultimately died in the Senate. Democrats have also championed the idea of a national infrastructure development bank. At least one proposal for such an entity in 2021 would have allowed the government to take equity stakes in infrastructure projects. And Biden considered launching a sovereign wealth fund. These approaches would have relied on legislation passed by Congress. But the legal basis for the Trump administration's investments is a grey area, Harrell said. The administration seems to rely on the rationale that it can take stakes because the law doesn't explicitly forbid it and the companies have agreed to the deals, he said.  The lack of a clear legal basis makes the companies vulnerable to lawsuits from competitors, Harrell said. They are also likely to face political scrutiny if power changes hands in Washington, he said.\"If Democrats take control of one or both chambers of Congress in November, a bunch of the CEOs of these companies are going to be hauled up in front of committees to answer questions about how these deals are going,\" he said.Companies like MP Materials have acknowledged these risks in filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Pentagon's deal with MP includes a price floor and offtake agreement in addition to an equity stake. MP warned investors that it could face \"government audits, investigations, congressional scrutiny\" and \"inquiries about conflicts of interest.\" It also warned the deal faces \"the risk of litigation\" and is vulnerable to \"changes in federal administration and related executive and legislative priorities.\"Congress has also not set clear guardrails to minimize potential conflicts of interest and favoritism in the Trump administration approach, Harrell said. One concern is that the government could favor companies in which it is a shareholder in areas like permitting and contracting, he said. USA Rare Earth was required to raise at least $500 million in private funding as a condition for its deal with the government. Commerce Secretary Lutnick's former firm Cantor Fitzgerald led the placement for that funding. Lutnick stepped down from Cantor when he joined the Trump administration and transferred his stake in the firm to his children. Capital misallocation riskThe equity stakes also raise the question of whether the government can be trusted to make the right bets on companies and technologies that will succeed over the long term, Harrell said. A bad bet would result in capital flowing to less competitive companies, and investors are already speculating on which companies the government will invest in next, Lincicome said. \"That's just straight up capital misallocation,\" he said.Business decisions could also become politicized, he said. Big companies could decide to do business with the government-backed firms to curry favor with the administration, Lincicome said. In the case of U.S. Steel, the federal government has a governance stake, called a golden share, rather than an economic interest in the company. The White House intervened last September to stop U.S. Steel from halting production at its Granite City plant in Illinois\"That's your worst-case scenario, that you start having politicians in Washington directing important business decisions based on political considerations and not what's best for the long-term health of the company,\" Lincicome said. USA Rare Earth CEO Barbara Humpton told CNBC in a January interview that the government is taking \"taking an economic interest\" in its business \"not a governance interest.\" Lutnick told CNBC last August that the stake in Intel is non-voting and does not include governance rights.\"Maybe they don't have formal voting rights,\" Lincicome said of the government equity stakes. \"But they do have a phone and they can pick up the phone and call. They do have the ability to influence decisions that just don't show up on paper or in a proxy vote.\"And a Democratic president could try to force companies with government stakes to adopt progressive policies like capping executive pay or using unionized labor, Harrell and Lincicome said. Corporate silenceTop executives have voiced virtually no public criticism of the Trump administration taking stakes. Citadel CEO Ken Griffin said this week that some executives quietly oppose the interventionist approach. \"When the U.S. government starts to engage in corporate America in a way that tastes of favoritism, I know for most CEOs that I'm friends with, they find it incredibly distasteful,\" Griffin told The Wall Street Journal on Tuesday. The number of government equity stakes is likely to grow. Lutnick told CNBC last August the Pentagon was considering stakes in major defense companies like Lockheed Martin. Trump said in January that he \"will not permit\" defense companies to issue dividends or stock buybacks until the firms accelerate their production of military equipment. Before the U.S. took its stake in Intel, Trump said CEO Lip-Bu Tan was \"highly conflicted\" and called for his resignation over his ties to Chinese companies. The comments sparked a brief sell-off of Intel shares. Other corporate executives are likely worried about crossing the administration and being punished, Lincicome said.\"The best outcome here for your shareholders is just to stay quiet,\" he said.",

    "body": "Justin Tallis | Afp | Getty ImagesBitcoin broke above $70,000 on Friday, just one day after narrowly avoiding falling below the key $60,000 mark, as part of a stunning rebound. The token rose to as much as $71,458.01 on Friday, up more than 11% on the day. It was last trading at $70,411.33 as of 3:16 p.m. ET. The forceful rebound followed the flagship cryptocurrency's dive below $61,000 on Thursday, marking a 15% plunge on the day. It comes as some investors are snapping up bitcoin after its more than 50% decline from its record high above $126,000 hit last October.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 918 points, or 1.9%. The S&P 500 added 1.4%, while the Nasdaq Composite traded up 1.5%.Investors' rotation back into risk-on assets drove stocks' surge amid fading fears over the threats posed by artificial intelligence technologies' to software firms.

Could bitcoin go lower again?Bitcoin is now trading close to its critical $70,000 level, sitting 45% off its all-time high. However, analysts said that bitcoin's earlier drop below $70,000 could signal further downside. watch nowOne firm, 10X Research, estimates bitcoin could go as low as $50,000, after a potential small bounce soon, Thielen said.\"I think we are going to have a little counter-trend rally that might go sideways or bounce a little bit,\" Thielen said. \"But I think during the summer we make another low.\"",

    "body": "For years, bedtime was the most stressful part of my day. No matter how early we started or how carefully I planned, evenings always felt chaotic.I've heard the same story from many of the parents I've worked with, and it's understandable. Bedtime is a major emotional transition that most of us were never taught how to navigate.But as a conscious-parenting researcher who has studied over 200 kids, I've noticed a clear pattern: The happiest, most emotionally well-rounded children have parents who follow a predictable routine that lowers anxiety and strengthens connection. Here's what they do differently.1. They let go of controlMany parents head into bedtime expecting resistance, and children can sense that tension almost immediately.Parents who experience smoother evenings aren't attached to how long the routine takes or how perfectly it unfolds. When you soften your grip on the outcome, your child's nervous system will follow.Remember, if bedtime takes 90 minutes instead of 30, but your child falls asleep feeling safe and calm, that's still a win.2. They connect before they disconnectStalling, clinging, tantrums and irritability at bedtime can be signs of separation anxiety. Parents who understand this slow down the final moments of the evening. They offer physical closeness or quiet presence before saying goodnight. Even 10 to 20 minutes of intentional connection can make a difference. From there, you can set clear but warm boundaries: \"I'm here with you now. After two books and a cuddle, it's time to turn the lights out.\"3. They remove pressure around sleepMany bedtime battles are simply about pressure. When children feel they're expected to \"fall asleep\" on command, their nervous systems shift into alert mode, making rest harder. Parents with the easiest nights stop making sleep the goal. They focus on creating calm conditions. This makes it more likely for our bodies to settle naturally.4. They build a bridge from night into morningTo a child, bedtime can feel like an abrupt ending. You can ease this transition by emphasizing what comes next: \"We'll finish this in the morning,\" or, \"We'll snuggle again when the sun comes up.\"This helps children experience bedtime as a pause, not a loss, reducing anxiety and resistance.Some parents also create this bridge by ending the night with a simple point of connection. They might ask, for example, \"What are you most excited for tomorrow?\" 5. They end the night by reinforcing safetySafety is the signal that tells a child's nervous system it can finally stop bracing and start resting. Without it, even the tiredest body stays alert.You can reinforce safety by saying things like: \"Today was hard. Tonight was hard. And I'm still here.\"\"You didn't have to be perfect today. You just had to be you.\"\"I'm here. You can rest.\" 6. They regulate their own emotionsFinally, and this might be the most important one: Emotionally attuned parents regulate themselves. Evenings are when you are most depleted and therefore most likely to react from stress rather than intention.So pause before engaging. Take a few deep breaths. Ask yourself whether you're carrying stress from the day into the moment. Settle yourself first, then support your child.Reem Raouda is a leading voice in conscious parenting and the creator of the BOUND and FOUNDATIONS journals, now offered together as her Emotional Safety Bundle.

    "body": "watch nowThe NFL plans to hold talks with non-traditional media companies to potentially sell them the rights to a live game, NFL Media chief Hans Schroeder told CNBC Sport on Friday.\"We have other people that are both partners in a smaller sense — maybe not a full package — or people that still are in the media landscape somewhere that would like to be an NFL live game partner,\" Schroeder said in an interview from Radio Row ahead of Super Bowl LX in San Francisco. \"We're going to have those conversations,\" he added. \"We want to understand all our options and how to think about the best model for us, for our fans, for our teams going forward. So to your question, you know, we're going to listen and probably have a lot of different people that want to have a conversation with us. That's very fortunate. We say that humbly, and we're going to make sure we have those conversations to understand.\"Schroeder didn't offer details on which companies could be interested in buying a live game. The NFL sold a week one game to YouTube last season for about $100 million -- a one-off strategy that it could replicate with other digital platforms. The societal-wide shift to streaming has made digital a comparable rival to broadcast TV, which has long been the league's preferred distribution strategy due to its reach.\"Now you see these big digital platforms that can reach broadcast level audiences,\" Schroeder said. \"That just creates more optionality.\"Get the CNBC Sport newsletter directly to your inboxThe CNBC Sport newsletter with Alex Sherman brings you the biggest news and exclusive interviews from the worlds of sports business and media, delivered weekly to your inbox.Subscribe here to get access today.The NFL and its traditional media partners — Disney, Paramount Global, Comcast's NBCUniversal and Amazon — will likely begin discussing a new media rights later this year, four years ahead of the current agreement's opt-out clause, according to people familiar with the matter. Schroeder echoed NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell's comments to CNBC in September that the league would be open to having those talks.\"I'm sure they're doing work on their end when the time's right, because they either want to sort of press the 'engage' button or the commissioner says, 'Hey, let's go do this,'\" Schroeder said.The NFL is expanding the number of international games to nine next season — a record high. The league may sell a new package of some of those games to a media partner as soon as next year, he said.\"That'll be one of the things we look at,\" Schroeder said.",

    "body": "When Amanda DeRise's father sent her a listing for a 140-year-old six-bedroom, two-bathroom house in Atlantic Highlands, New Jersey, in 2024, her first thought was that it needed a lot of work. Her realtor even called it a \"money pit.\" But Amanda, 32, and her husband, Vincent, 34, saw potential in the home. Amanda and Vincent decided to start saving for their future home in 2021, but quickly realized a new build or freshly renovated property would be out of their budget, Vincent says. It's why the listing Amanda's father sent her seemed to be perfect for them, she says. The location would also allow Amanda to take the local ferry into New York City for work. The six-bedroom, two bathroom house was built in the 1800s.Tasia Jensen | CNBC Make ItThe couple's realtor told them the house was for sale by an older man who had raised his family there and did not want to sell it to an investor. \"I wrote a nice letter to the older man stating that we want to take care of this house and bring it back to its former glory,\" Amanda says.The three decided on a sale price of $550,000 — $90,000 under the asking price. The DeRises closed on the house on Halloween night in 2024 with a 15% down payment of $82,500. They obtained a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage with a 7.125% rate and a monthly payment of just under $3,900, including taxes and insurance, according to documents reviewed by CNBC Make It.The next step: Renovating the property piece by piece. Modernizing the home, while preserving its charmAmanda and Vincent moved into the house in November 2024 and started renovations just a few weeks later, which included taking down the second floor to the studs, adding central air and modernizing the house while preserving its charm. They say the house was in pretty bad condition when they first bought it. The wallpaper was peeling off the walls, the windows needed to be redone and the siding needed updating.Amanda and Vincent DeRise slept in the living room while renovating the second floor of their 140-year-old New Jersey home.Tasia Jensen | CNBC Make ItDuring the renovation, the couple wanted to make sure some of the original features of the house were restored. They had the original window trim replicated, kept what they think is an original light fixture in the dining room and used a lot of furniture left by the previous owners.They have made changes to the layout, though, such as combining two of the bedrooms to create a larger primary bedroom.Amanda and Vincent estimate they've spent about $172,000 on renovations, which they've funded through personal savings, a 401(k) loan and selling equity from a former employer, they say. So far, the most expensive parts of the renovation have been the siding and the windows, which totaled around $70,000. In addition to income from their 9-to-5 jobs — Amanda is an administrative assistant at a fintech company and Vincent is a director of revenue operations at a SaaS company — the couple earn money from TikTok's Creator Fund. They started sharing their renovation journey on TikTok in November 2024 and currently have 41,000 followers, with several of their videos getting over 600,000 views. Amanda says sharing their journey on TikTok helped them get a brand deal to get free paint for parts of the house.   Living through a renovationLiving in the house while renovating it was the hardest part of fixing it up, Amanda says. The couple slept in the living room while they renovated the second floor.\"We had moments where windows were being blown out as we're living in here. The home was always a construction zone because it was pretty major projects going on,\" Vincent says.Amanda and Vincent did a lot of things themselves in the house.Amanda and Vincent DeRiseThey could have rented an apartment during this period, but didn't want to spend additional money, Vincent says. To stretch their budget as far as possible, the couple not only lived in the home but also downgraded their car and canceled subscriptions such as YouTube TV.There's still a long way to goAlthough they are getting ready to welcome a their first child, the couple says the renovations are still not done and won't be for several years. In fact, Amanda says the joke is that they probably will never be done. \"There will always be something to do,\" she says. The couple has yet to renovate the house's third floor, which includes Vincent's office and the attic. The kitchen also still needs work, which Vincent and Amanda hope to complete in the next few years. \"I don't want to make it feel like a modern kitchen,\" Amanda says. \"I definitely want to keep the charm of an older home.\"However, the couple say they are enjoying the process, especially the items they've found inside the house. Their findings include a Stan Musial 1948 rookie baseball card, handwritten letters from the 1930s, a purse with old shopping receipts from 1925 and a vintage breast pump.The discoveries have the couple thinking about what they could put into the walls for future owners to find.\"We have just been collecting some random items, some of our own that we plan to put maybe in the floorboards in the attic or, while we're renovating more rooms, put them in the walls,\" Amanda says.Investing in the futureVincent says he was originally against buying the house because of the work it needed, but thought it would be a good investment given the town and its location. In 2025, Netflix closed on a deal to buy Fort Monmouth, a former Army base less than 10 miles from Atlantic Highlands. The company plans to build a $900 million campus that will include 12 soundstages, backlot areas and production facilities, NBC reports. \"One thing about the home is that we always knew it was going to be a good investment. It's an exciting place to be,\" Vincent says. \"There's a lot of renovations happening across the county and the town, so we always just thought that this home would be the right type of investment, especially because we believe we'll be here for a very long time.\"The couple knows they plan on staying in the house for a very long time.Tasia Jensen | CNBC Make ItGoing forward, \"We're excited to continue to make this home our own,\" Amanda says. \"Maybe someone in 100 years looks at some of the work that we've done around the home and sees our touch to it,\" Vincent adds.

    "body": "The Trump administration has made unprecedented equity investments and obtained other stakes in at least 10 companies over the past year.Many are in critical mineral companies as the White House plots a strategy to directly back mining companies to build a domestic supply chain and reduce dependence on China. But the investments also include chipmakers and possibly a nuclear reactor company. In the case of U.S. Steel, the administration has taken a governance stake rather than a direct economic interest. The number of investments is extraordinary outside of wartime or an economic crisis, said Scott Lincicome, a trade lawyer and a researcher at the libertarian Cato Institute.And the administration's portfolio could keep growing. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told CNBC last August that the government could take stakes in major defense suppliers, such as Lockheed Martin.  In the past, the U.S. has taken temporary stakes in companies in the context of bailouts, said Peter Harrell, who served as the senior director for international economics under President Joe Biden. \"With these companies, it's a very different thesis,\" Harrell said. \"The government is kind of acting as a strategic investor to put capital into these companies so that these companies can achieve both a commercial return but also, at least in theory, some kind [of] national purpose.\" U.S. SteelPresident Trump secured a \"golden share\" in U.S. Steel as a condition for approving Nippon Steel's acquisition of the historic manufacturer.  The golden share is a governance stake that gives the president veto power over key business decisions. It is not a direct economic stake in U.S. Steel. The president can veto decisions to close, idle or sell U.S. Steel plants. He can also block U.S. Steel from changing its name, moving its headquarters from Pittsburgh or relocating the company outside the U.S. U.S. Steel stopped trading on the NYSE in June 2025 after becoming a subsidiary of Nippon. MP MaterialsMP Materials is a critical minerals company headquartered in Las Vegas that operates the only commercial rare earth mine in the U.S. at Mountain Pass in California. It has a market value of more than $10 billlion.The Defense Department struck a landmark deal with MP in July 2025 that includes an equity stake, a price floor and an agreement to buy a portion of future output. The Pentagon agreed to buy $400 million of preferred stock and is entitled to a warrant allowing it to purchase additional shares. MP said in July that exercising these options would give the Pentagon a 15% stake, positioning it as the company's largest single shareholder. IntelThe Commerce Department took a 10% stake in Intel in August 2025, buying 433.3 million shares of the chipmaker's common stock at $20.47 per share. Funding for the investment came from $5.7 billion of government grants under the CHIPS Act and $3.2 billion in federal awards under a program to make chips secure. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told CNBC last August that the stake is non-voting and does not include governance rights. Lithium AmericasLithium Americas is a critical minerals startup with no revenue that is developing a lithium mine in Humboldt County, Nevada called Thacker Pass. It has a $1.5 billion market cap. The Department of Energy took a 5% stake in Lithium Americas and a 5% economic stake in its joint venture with General Motors to develop Thacker Pass. In exchange, the department agreed to defer $182 million of debt service on a $2.3 billion federal loan over five years.\"If we're going to push out part of the repayment into later years, then the administration would like a very small stake of equity to create essentially a cash buffer and eliminate some risk on behalf of taxpayers,\" a Trump administration official told CNBC in September.Lithium Americas is based in Vancouver, British Columbia. It trades on both the Toronto Stock Exchange and the NYSE.Trilogy MetalsTrilogy Metals is another critical minerals startup with no revenue. It aims to develop a mining project in Alaska called Upper Kobuk Mineral Projects using a controversial, 211-mile-long Ambler Road to extract copper and other materials.President Donald Trump approved permits for to construct Ambler Road in October and the administration invested $35.6 million in the project. The investment makes the U.S. government a 10% shareholder in Trilogy with warrants to purchase an additional 7.5% of the company. Trilogy is also headquartered in Vancouver and trades on the Toronto Stock Exchange and the NYSE. USA Rare EarthUSA Rare Earth is yet another critical minerals startup that is also not generating any revenue yet. It is developing a magnet manufacturing facility in Stillwater, Oklahoma and plans to build a rare earth mine at a deposit called Round Top in Texas. USA Rare Earth has a $4.6 billion market capitalization.The Commerce Department issued a letter of intent on Jan. 26 to provide USA Rare Earth with a $1.3 billion loan and $277 million in federal funding.In exchange, USA Rare Earth will issue 16.1 million shares of common stock and 17.6 million in warrants to the U.S. The government will have an 8% to 16% stake in the company, depending on whether the warrants are exercised. CEO Barbara Humpton told CNBC in an interview that the government is \"taking an economic interest in the business, not a governance interest.\"WestinghouseWestinghouse is a private nuclear reactor developer. It is owned by publicly traded Cameco, a Canadian uranium miner, and Brookfield Asset Management. The Commerce Department signed a deal with Cameco and Brookfield in October to finance the construction of Westinghouse nuclear plants worth $80 billion. Under the deal, the government is granted a participation interest in Westinghouse and can require an initial public offering on or before January 2029 if the company's value rises above $30 billion.The government could become an 8% shareholder in Westinghouse under that scenario, Cameco Chief Operating Officer Grant Isaac said on the company's third-quarter earnings call in November 2025. Vulcan ElementsVulcan Elements is a private startup based in Durham, North Carolina. Vulcan entered into a $1.4 billion partnership with the U.S. government and ReElement Technologies to build a domestic rare earth magnet supply chain. Vulcan will build a 10,000 metric ton magnet facility in the U.S. It will receive a $620 million loan from the Pentagon, $550 million of incentives from the Commerce Department and raise $550 million in private capital.Under the deal, Commerce will receive a $50 million equity stake in Vulcan and the Pentagon gets warrants in the company. XLightXLight is a private company headquartered in Palo Alto, California that is developing free-electron lasers to manufacture semiconductors. The Commerce Department in December issued a letter of intent to provide xLight with up to $150 million in federal incentives. In exchange, Commerce would receive a $150 million equity stake in xLight.L3HarrisL3Harris Technologies is a defense company with more than $65 billion market cap. It announced a proposed partnership with the U.S. government in December in which the Pentagon would invest $1 billion in its rocket motor business, whose motors are used in missile systems.Under the terms of the investment, L3Harris would launch an initial public offering of its missile business in the second half of 2026, at which point the Pentagon's $1 billion investment would convert into common equity of the spun off division.

    "body": "There are two ways to get back to the level of home affordability Americans had for much of the last decade, according to Realtor.com. Neither looks realistic anytime soon.In 2019, the mortgage payment for a median-priced home took up about 21% of median household income. Today, it accounts for more than 30%, reflecting sharply higher home prices and mortgage rates that have nearly doubled since January 2022, according to a recent analysis from the real estate listings platform.Barring a sharp drop in home prices, Realtor.com calculates that getting monthly payments back to 2019 levels would require one of two things:Household incomes rising 56% to a median of $132,171, up from $84,763 todayMortgage rates falling to 2.65%, down from 6.15% as of Feb. 6Neither option appears likely in the near term. Real median household income has risen only about 17% over the past 20 years, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. Mortgage rates are more likely to ease from their current 30-year fixed rate, though most forecasts still have them hovering near 6% through 2026.Even at that level, affordability gains may be limited. The National Association of Realtors projects that home prices will rise about 4% in 2026 as renewed demand runs up against stubborn supply shortages.\"The U.S. housing market continues to grapple with a persistent mismatch between housing supply and buyer demand,\" Hannah Jones, senior economic research analyst at Realtor.com, tells CNBC Make It. \"If buyer demand strengthens without a corresponding increase in supply, renewed price growth is likely.\"Limited housing supply remains a challengeA chronic shortage of homes continues to weigh on housing affordability. There is a nationwide housing shortfall of nearly 4 million homes, Realtor.com estimates, a gap that helps explain why lower mortgage rates or stronger wage growth alone may not be enough to deliver substantial affordability gains.\"You don't really solve an affordability crisis by subsidizing demand through artificially cheap financing,\" says Realtor.com senior economist Jake Krimmel. For costs to go down, the supply of homes has to better meet demand, he says.Supply has been slow to catch up in part because zoning rules and lengthy permitting processes often limit how much new housing can be built or where it can go, according to a separate Realtor.com report from 2025.Expanding housing supply through additional construction and policy changes remains critical to easing affordability pressures, particularly in supply-constrained markets, according to NAR.At the federal level, lawmakers have introduced bipartisan proposals aimed at zoning, permitting and construction bottlenecks, though most remain in early stages.More change is happening at the state level. Texas and California have passed laws to loosen zoning rules and streamline permitting, but the impact has been mixed so far.The timeline for closing the housing supply gap also varies sharply by region, according to a 2025 Realtor.com report. At the current pace of construction and household formation, the report estimates the supply gap could close within three years in the South and six and a half years in the West. The Midwest would need roughly four decades. In the Northeast, the gap would not close at all under current trends.Want to get ahead at work with AI?

    "body": "watch nowElon Musk's journey to becoming the world's first trillionaire will likely be powered by rockets rather than cars, as SpaceX now accounts for nearly two-thirds of the Tesla CEO's wealth.Musk became the first person ever to top the $800 billion mark this week, with his net worth now around $845 billion, according to Forbes. He's worth more than the next three richest people – Google co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin and Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg – combined.The tech magnate's unprecedented wealth surged after his aerospace and defense company, SpaceX, acquired his artificial intelligence and social media company, xAI, this week in a deal that valued the merged entity at $1.25 trillion, according to financial documents reviewed by CNBC. With Musk's ownership estimated at around 43% in the combined company, his stake would be valued at over $530 billion, marking a rapid shift in his fortunes. Musk's priorities are also likely shifting his focus more to SpaceX than Tesla, a reality that the EV company acknowledged in its latest proxy filing, where it noted that \"a majority of Mr. Musk's wealth is now derived from other business ventures.\"Last year, Musk confirmed he wants to take SpaceX public in 2026, which would make Tesla a less prevalent component of his liquid wealth. But he still has to get buy-in from public market investors, who may be reluctant to pay up for a company that combines a defense contractor and satellite business with a cash-burning AI model developer that's trying to take on Google, OpenAI and Anthropic. SpaceX has received more than $20 billion from contracts with the federal government, according to research from FedScout, with more lucrative contracts on the way, and Musk has framed the acquisition as the next step towards \"orbital data centers.\"\"You've muddied up your story a little bit as a pure-play SpaceX shareholder, but the opportunity has gotten a lot bigger,\" said Greg Martin, managing director at Rainmaker Securities, which works on transactions for pre-IPO companies. \"It makes sense for them to access a much larger capital market, especially with xAI, which does have insatiable need for capital.\" XAI is currently being investigated by authorities in Europe, Asia, Australia and California, after the company's Grok image generator let users create and share \"deepfake\" explicit images of children and women.It's not clear whether Musk's merger will require any regulatory review. Democratic senators this week called for the Pentagon to investigate SpaceX over undisclosed Chinese investors in the company.watch nowMusk still has a major incentive to stay focused on Tesla. Late last year, shareholders voted to approve a new pay package that could be worth $1 trillion, paid out in 12 tranches, if Tesla hits certain milestones, including market cap gains and operational achievements, over the next decade. The first tranche of stock gets paid out if Tesla hits a market cap of $2 trillion, about $460 billion more than the current valuation.Tesla said in the proxy filing detailing the plan that the structure aims to \"prevent him from prioritizing those other ventures.\"However, Columbia Law professor Dorothy Lund, a corporate and securities law expert, told CNBC in an email that the strategy may not work. Musk is now \"negotiating comp packages at each company, with each board trying to induce him to pay attention via comp,\" Lund wrote. \"If SpaceX/xAI gives him more money and a bigger share, that Tesla package may look less appealing.\" Before the xAI acquisition, Musk owned about 42% of SpaceX and controlled 80% of the votes, according to FCC reports. His current ownership in Tesla is between 11% and 15% of shares outstanding, depending on what's included in his stake, according to public filings.With Tesla's brand value and core auto sales in decline, and its long-promised robotaxis and humanoid robots still in development, the company's stock price is down about 9% this year.Based on Musk's ownership in SpaceX, and assuming Tesla shares are flat, the rocket and AI company would have to reach a valuation of about $1.6 trillion for the world's richest person to reach trillionaire status.Ross Gerber, CEO of investment firm Gerber Kawasaki, is betting that Musk won't ever want to take SpaceX public as a standalone entity. Rather, he expects to see a merger of SpaceX and Tesla, and he speculated this week it would list on the New York Stock Exchange under ticker symbol X, which formerly belonged to U.S. Steel. Gerber is a long-time Tesla investor and now holds shares in SpaceX after his firm previously backed Musk's leveraged buyout of Twitter in 2022. Musk rebranded Twitter as X, and merged the social network with xAI last year. Consolidating his empire makes sense, Gerber said, because it would allow Musk to fulfill his dream of running one big company under the brand name X. Following Alphabet's announcement this week that it will spend up to $185 billion on capex this year, Gerber said Musk is going to have to be able to bring in massive sums of cash. \"This huge entity would make it easier for them to raise money and borrow,\" he said. \"How else is Musk supposed to compete and become a major AI player?\"Musk didn't respond to a request for comment.

    "body": "Actor Austin Butler attends the 16th Governors Awards at the Ray Dolby Ballroom at Ovation Hollywood in Los Angeles, Nov. 16, 2025.Valerie Macon | AFP | Getty ImagesWith an affordability crisis taking hold, financial stability is in fashion. Whether it's wearing a quarter-zip sweater or the latest \"401(k) mullet\" hairstyle, young men, especially, are leaning into styles that give an air of monetary responsibility.\"Men not only found a voice but are finding their place through these trends,\" said Thomaï Serdari, professor of marketing and director of the fashion and luxury program at New York University's Stern School of Business.Clothing, hairstyles, music and even underwear have often been seen as leading economic indicators. For example, former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan believed that men's buying habits regarding underwear were a good indication of whether consumers were making fewer discretionary purchases.Here's what experts say these new trends show about how consumers feel toward the U.S. economy and the job market.The '401(k) mullet'The old 401(k) is now cool. These employer-sponsored retirement savings plans have been steadily gaining steam for years, but in 2026, they've tapped into the zeitgeist. A new NerdWallet survey found that 15% of adults wouldn't date someone who didn't have a retirement account. According to Vogue, the \"401(k) mullet\" is catching on, which is a more grown-up version of its shaggy predecessor.Jacob Elordi attends the premiere of \"Wuthering Heights\" at TCL Chinese Theatre in Hollywood, California, Jan. 28, 2026Unique Nicole | Filmmagic | Getty ImagesUnlike previous iterations, \"the 401(k) haircut is very contained,\" Serdari said. \"We are finally moving away from the time of the tech entrepreneur who drops out of college and yet will make tons of money,\" she said. \"People are slowly returning to a more put-together version of themselves with the intention of finding a job.\" Men want to \"emulate the lifestyle they want to achieve and, in that way, attract success,\" Serdari said.Social media seems to agree: When rapper T-Pain posted a photo of himself on Instagram in mid-November with the caption \"401k and a quarter zip,\" he garnered more than 122,000 likes. The 'quarter-zip movement'Since recent grad Jason Gyamfi started the \"quarter-zip movement\" in a Nov. 5 TikTok video, the sweater itself has become a symbol of how to look like an up-and-coming professional.\"What began as a simple style shift became a message — one that's inspiring people to grow, reinvent themselves, and carry confidence in everything they do,\" Gyamfi wrote in a Dec. 10 LinkedIn post about his viral video, which has been viewed more than 31 million times. Filadendron | Istock | Getty ImagesWith fewer job prospects, in part due to the rise of artificial intelligence, \"a lot of young people feel the odds are against them,\" Serdari said. \"They don't have a way of reaching the security their parents and grandparents had,\" she said.  Amid today's softening labor market, the traditional \"path to a stable job with a 401(k) and prospects of success and financial growth … is not guaranteed,\" she said.\"What used to be boring — the 401(k) — is unattainable and therefore sexy,\" Serdari said.Read more CNBC personal finance coverageHow Trump's child tax credit changes could impact your refund this seasonSome older Americans are 'unretiring' to keep up with cost of living: AARP surveyBitcoin sells off amid 'crypto winter.'

In the years that followed, the so-called K-shaped economy left the wealthiest Americans even better off than before, largely after benefiting from stock market gains and appreciating home values.Even when most Americans were living paycheck to paycheck, the trend toward luxury took hold in a big way once consumers caught Gwyneth Paltrow's courtroom aesthetic at her ski accident trial in 2023.Actress Gwyneth Paltrow enters the courtroom for her trial in Park City, Utah, March 24, 2023.Rick Bowmer | Getty ImagesA year later, TikToker Megan Boni posted a video that quickly went viral when she sang about trying to find a \"man in finance\" with a \"trust fund.\" That video was viewed more than 60 million times.Since then, the consumer economy has only become more bifurcated. Wealth continues to rise faster for those at the very top, data from the Federal Reserve shows, as the value of their investment holdings grows. The top 10% of Americans hold over 87% of corporate equities and mutual fund shares.\"People are searching to find a recipe for belonging, for making it in a world that has been exclusionary with a growing disparity between rich and poor,\" Serdari said.401(k) balances are growingMany of these workers are now exhibiting \"positive savings behaviors,\" according to Kirsten Hunter Peterson, vice president of workplace thought leadership at Fidelity Investments, the nation's largest provider of 401(k) savings plans.watch nowOverall, retirement account balances, which sank at the start of 2025 amid wild market swings, are at all-time highs, according to the latest data from Fidelity.  Near the end of last year, the average 401(k) balance hit a record $144,400, Fidelity found.\"When it comes to younger workers, many of them do get a bad rap [on saving for retirement], but the numbers tell a different story,\" Hunter Peterson said.While other research points to retirement saving shortfalls across generations, \"Gen Z is saving earlier and at higher rates than previous generations before them,\" she said.In part, Generation Z is more prone to sharing financial information and tips on social media and, in some cases, that is an extremely effective way to convey the benefits of saving for retirement, Hunter Peterson said. Still, there is no substitute for personalized recommendations from a vetted financial advisor, she added. \"When it comes to taking action, especially for younger investors, it's important to listen to a trusted source,\" she said. \"There are a lot of 'finfluencers' out there who are not licensed professionals.\"Subscribe to CNBC on YouTube.",

    "body": "The logo for Google LLC is seen at the Google Store Chelsea in Manhattan, New York, Nov. 17, 2021.Andrew Kelly | ReutersMore than 900 Google workers have signed an open letter condemning recent actions by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Customs and Border Protection (CBP), urging the tech giant to disclose its dealings with the agencies and divest from them.The letter, citing recent ICE killings of Keith Porter, Renee Good, and Alex Pretti, said that the employees are \"appalled by the violence\" and \"horrified\" by Google's part in it.\"Google is powering this campaign of surveillance, violence, and repression,\" the letter reads. It goes on to cite that Google Cloud is aiding CBP surveillance and powering Palantir's ImmigrationOS system, which is used by ICE. The letter states that Google's generative artificial intelligence is used by CBP and that the Google Play Store has blocked ICE tracking apps.The letter also quotes a social media post by Google Chief Scientist Jeff Dean from early January, who wrote, \"We all bear a collective responsibility to speak up and not be silent when we see things like the events of the last week.\"\"We are vehemently opposed to Google's partnerships with DHS, CBP, and ICE,\" the employees wrote. \"We consider it our leadership's ethical and policy-bound responsibility to disclose all contracts and collaboration with CBP and ICE, and to divest from these partnerships.\"The letter calls on Google to acknowledge the danger that workers face from ICE, host an emergency internal Q&A on the company's DHS and military contracts, implement safety measures to protect workers — such as flexible work-from-home policies and immigration support — and reveal its ties with the government agencies to help all involved determine where the company will draw a line.\"As workers of conscience, we demand that our leadership end our backslide into contracting for governments enacting violence against civilians,\" the letter reads. \"Google is now a prominent node in a shameful lineage of private companies profiting from violent state repression. We must use this moment to come together as a Googler community and demand an end to this disgraceful use of our labor.\"Google did not immediately respond to a CNBC request for comment.The letter comes as employees place mounting pressure on tech CEOs to speak out against ICE. Just two weeks prior, employees representing Amazon, Spotify, Meta and more wrote a similar letter demanding ICE \"out of our cities.\"",

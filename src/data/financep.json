    "description": "New-car prices have never been higher.The average sale price reached $50,080 in September, marking the first time it has topped $50,000, according to ",
    "body": "New-car prices have never been higher.The average sale price reached $50,080 in September, marking the first time it has topped $50,000, according to Kelley Blue Book.The milestone came as shoppers rushed to buy electric vehicles before a $7,500 federal tax credit expired on Sept. 30, with EVs selling for an average of $58,124, which helped push overall prices higher, according to KBB.While new-car prices typically rise in early fall, September's year-over-year increase was the largest since the spring of 2023, driven by EV purchases, higher luxury sales and, to a lesser extent, tariffs, KBB says.\"Now that [the EV] incentive is gone, it's possible that electric vehicle sales will drop off somewhat and the average transaction price may dip below $50,000 in the later part of the year,\" Brian Moody, executive editor for Kelley Blue Book, tells CNBC Make It. Either way, car prices have climbed steadily since February. And once expenses like insurance, maintenance and fuel are factored in, monthly costs can exceed $1,000.What a $50,000 car really costs per monthTo show what today's prices mean for buyers, consider a $50,080 vehicle financed over 60 months with 20% down and a 7.12% interest rate — the current national average for a five-year new-car loan, according to Bankrate.That works out to a monthly payment of about $796. But when you add in gas and insurance, the real monthly cost climbs higher. Americans spend an average of $177 a month on fuel, per an analysis by Empower, and the national average cost of auto insurance with liability, collision and comprehensive protection is $242, per Experian. That brings total monthly costs for a new-car owner to roughly $1,215 a month.There are also annual and ongoing costs to consider, including:Maintenance and repairs: about $900 a year on average across all vehicle types in the U.S., according to ConsumerAffairsRegistration fees: an average of roughly $75 a year for registration, although it varies considerably by state, according to InsurifyConsider used or leased cars to offset costsIt's worth remembering that new cars can lose about 20% of their value in the first year and as much as 60% after five years, according to Kelley Blue Book.For cost-conscious buyers, it may be worth exploring used and leased options, which generally come with lower monthly payments.\"We're seeing more and more people turn to leasing as a way to keep ownership costs down as everything gets more expensive,\" says Zander Cook, co-founder of lease-buyout platform Lease End.Leasing essentially means renting a new car for a set term instead of buying it outright. While monthly payments tend to be lower, leases come with mileage limits — usually 10,000 to 15,000 miles per year — and may include fees for excess wear or mileage. Leases also don't result in ownership once the term ends.\"Leasing doesn't work for everyone. If you're driving a ton of miles a year or live somewhere really rural, it's probably not the best fit,\" Cook says. \"But for most people, especially those living in cities or suburbs, driving 10,000 to 12,000 miles a year, leasing makes a lot of sense.\"Another option is to buy a used car. The tradeoff here is that it may lead to higher maintenance and repair costs as the vehicle ages and warranty coverage expires.However, cars that are around three years old often hit the sweet spot between price and reliability, according to J.D. Power. By then, most models have absorbed the steepest depreciation but still fall within warranty coverage.Want to level up your AI skills? Sign up for Smarter by CNBC Make It's new online course, How To Use AI To Communicate Better At Work.

    "body": "The headquaters of US auto company General Motos (GM) in Detroit, Michigan.Uli Deck | Picture Alliance | Getty ImagesDETROIT – General Motors laid off more than 200 salaried employees on Friday, as the automaker continues to reevaluate its businesses and cut costs to boost profits.The impacted employees were largely Computer-Aided Design, or CAD, engineers who worked at the company's global tech campus in metro Detroit, according to GM.\"We're restructuring our design engineering team to strengthen our core architectural design engineering capabilities,\" GM said in an emailed statement. \"As a result, a number of CAD execution roles have been eliminated. We recognize the efforts and accomplishments of the impacted team members, and we thank them for their contributions.\"GM declined to comment on the number of employees affected, but a source familiar with the matter confirmed to CNBC that it was more than 200 employees, which was first reported by Bloomberg News. The person spoke anonymously because the number had not yet been made public.The employees were told their roles were being eliminated due to \"business conditions\" and not their performance via Microsoft Teams calls on Friday, the source said.The Detroit automaker has been regularly reviewing its business units and organizations for years in an effort to cut costs, boost profits and eliminate what it considers unneeded or overstaffed roles for future operations.The most recent layoffs represent a small percentage of the automaker's salaried workforce, but continue a trend of white-collar U.S. headcount reductions. GM's U.S. salaried headcount fell from 53,000 in 2023 to 50,000 to end last year.GM's layoffs also come a day after all-electric vehicle maker Rivian laid off roughly 4.5% of its workforce, or more than 600 people, to restructure some teams as the EV market faces growing challenges amid policy changes and slower-than-expected demand.The most recent cuts come as President Donald Trump touted on social media Friday that Ford Motor and GM are \"UP BIG on Tariffs\" amid tariff changes last week for heavy- and medium-duty trucks, which he referred to as \"Big and Midsized Trucks.\"While both Ford and GM, including CEO Mary Barra, this week praised the tariff changes, which also included extending offsets on U.S.-produced vehicles, the automakers are still seeing additional cost burdens from the levies. These changes are simply helping to lower those added costs.The layoffs come days after GM raised its 2025 financial guidance Tuesday as it beat Wall Street's top- and bottom-line earnings expectations for the third quarter, causing the stock to have its second-best day on the market since its 2009 emergence from bankruptcy.Shares of GM are up more than 29% this year, while Ford's stock is up roughly 38%. Both hit new 52-week highs on Friday.",

    "body": "In this photo illustration, iPhone screens display various social media apps on the screens on February 9, 2025 in Bath, England.Anna Barclay | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesThe European Commission, the executive arm of the European Union, said on Friday that it had preliminarily found both TikTok and Meta in breach of its transparency rules.It accused the U.S. tech giants of breaching their obligation to give researchers \"adequate access\" to public data under the Digital Services Act (DSA) — the EU's landmark tech legislation.\"The Commission also preliminarily found Meta, for both Instagram and Facebook, in breach of its obligations to provide users simple mechanisms to notify illegal content, as well as to allow them to effectively challenge content moderation decisions,\" it added in a statement.The Digital Services Act is among a handful of EU legislation designed to keep the power of Big Tech in check. The Commission has also opened numerous investigations under another landmark law known as the Digital Markets Act.\"We disagree with any suggestion that we have breached the DSA, and we continue to negotiate with the European Commission on these matters,\" Meta spokesperson Ben Walters said in a statement.\"In the European Union, we have introduced changes to our content reporting options, appeals process, and data access tools since the DSA came into force and are confident that these solutions match what is required under the law in the EU,\" he added.A TikTok spokesperson told CNBC in a statement that it \"is committed to transparency and values the contribution of researchers\" to its platform and social media industry as a whole.\"We have made substantial investments in data sharing and almost 1000 research teams have been given access to data through our Research Tools to date,\" the spokesperson said.\"We are reviewing the European Commission's findings, but requirements to ease data safeguards place the DSA and GDPR in direct tension. If it is not possible to fully comply with both, we urge regulators to provide clarity on how these obligations should be reconciled,\" they added.The EU says researchers should have access to social media platforms' data, as this enables the public to scrutinize any potential physical or mental health impacts of the technology.The Commission said in its preliminary findings that Facebook, Instagram and TikTok \"may have put in place burdensome procedures and tools for researchers to request access to public data. This often leaves them with partial or unreliable data, impacting their ability to conduct research, such as whether users, including minors, are exposed to illegal or harmful content.\"The tech companies are now invited by the Commission to examine its findings and reply in writing.If the Commission's preliminary findings are upheld, it has the power to issue a non-compliance decision which could carry with it a fine of up to 6% of the total worldwide annual turnover — a hefty amount for Meta and TikTok owner ByteDance.Meta also faced a 200 million euros ($228.4 million) fine under the Digital Markets Act in April, as the Commission flexed its new competition powers for the first time. The fine was related to how users consented to data collection.Meanwhile, TikTok's transfer of data to China also resulted in it being handed a 530 million euros fine by the protection authority in Ireland earlier this year.— CNBC's Arjun Kharpal contributed to this report.",

    "body": "A member of staff poses next to trading boards at the London Stock Exchange on April 25, 2025 in London, England.Carl Court | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesThe amount of money managed by hedge funds has reached an all-time high of $5 trillion, fueled by a surge in capital allocations in the third quarter coupled with positive investment returns.Analysis published Thursday by industry tracker Hedge Fund Research (HFR) showed total global assets under management stood at a landmark $4.98 trillion at the end of the third quarter.Overall industry assets swelled by $238.4 billion in the three-month period that ended Sept. 30.This included $33.7 billion in net new allocations from investors such as pension funds, insurance companies, sovereign wealth funds, endowments and family offices. HFR said that was the biggest quarterly net asset inflow since the third quarter of 2007 — before the Global Financial Crisis.The remainder of the third-quarter capital increase stemmed from positive trading gains made by managers throughout the three-month period.Here, HFR's main Fund Weighted Composite Index — which aims to provide an overall snapshot of the industry — gained 5.4% during the period.The index, which tracks the gains and losses of more than 1,400 single manager funds across all strategy types, is up 9.5% since the start of 2025.HFR president Kenneth Heinz said the \"historic growth\" has been driven by a mix of rising M&A activity among corporates, successful bets on the ongoing AI and tech boom and growing expectations for lower interest rates.\"While risk-on sentiment has dominated recent months, risks have also evolved, with managers participating in acceleration of these trends through year end but also positioning for sentiment and trend reversals across equities, commodities, currencies and cryptocurrencies,\" Heinz said.More to come?The big winners during the third quarter were equity hedge fund managers, who trade stocks long and short, often using thematic analyses, sector-specific approaches and fundamental single-company research.During the third quarter, they made 7.2% in investment returns, and saw their assets grow by $96.7 billion, including positive investor net inflows of $18 billion.Overall, that brought equity-focused funds' total capital to $1.5 trillion — making them the biggest hedge fund sub-strategy in terms of assets. Year-to-date, stock-picking strategies have gained about 13.6%.The other key beneficiary has been macro hedge funds, which invest in macroeconomic and geopolitical trends using equities, bonds, currencies, commodities and other assets.General view of the City of London skyline, the capital's financial district.Sopa Images | Lightrocket | Getty ImagesMacro strategies' assets grew by $33.5 billion overall during Q3, with clients pouring in $1.7 billion net, bringing total macro capital to $759 billion. Macro managers added 4.7% in investment returns in Q3. Having recouped losses suffered earlier in the year, the sector is up 3.8% in the nine months to the end of September.Heinz said the industry can expect more money to flow into its coffers as investors look to traverse a challenging geopolitical environment and trade policy uncertainty.\"Institutions seeking to strategically position for these trends, including both continued acceleration and defensive reversals, are likely to increase allocations to managers which have demonstrated their ability to navigate both the recent risk-on trends, as well as volatile reversals, with these allocations set to drive industry growth beyond the $5 trillion milestone into year-end.\"",

    "body": "Hoka shoes are seen in a store in Krakow, Poland on February 1, 2023. Jakub Porzycki | Nurphoto | Getty ImagesShares of footwear maker Deckers Brands plunged more than 12% Friday after the company trimmed its sales guidance for Hoka and Ugg — the two brands driving its growth — over concerns that tariffs are leading to a slide in demand.Hoka, an up-and-coming running shoe brand, is now expected to grow by a low-teens percentage in fiscal 2026 after growing 24% in the year-ago period, while Boots brand Ugg is expected to grow in the range of a low to mid single-digit percentage, after growing 13% in the year-ago period.In May, the company said Hoka and Ugg were expected to grow in the mid-teens and mid-single digits, respectively, in fiscal 2026 but it caveated that forecast by saying it was conceived prior to the introduction of President Donald Trump's tariffs. At the time, it quantified the expected impact to its costs but said it remained to be determined what kind of impact the new duties could have on demand.When reporting fiscal second-quarter earnings on Thursday, finance chief Steven Fasching said the impacts tariffs and higher prices are having on demand are now more clear.\"Part of the framework that we gave at the beginning of the year really said if tariffs did not have an impact on consumers, how we saw kind of certain growth, and we still believe that, right? But we do know and we are more currently seeing some impacts on the U.S. consumer,\" Fasching told analysts on the company's conference call. \"So as U.S. consumers are beginning to see some price increases. It is impacting their purchase behavior within the consumer discretionary space.\"He added the guidance isn't far off from what the company originally thought but acknowledged there is a \"little bit of a reduction\" in its forecast.The slower pace of growth for Deckers' two top-performing lines, along with the trim to their sales guidance, signals the two brands could be losing momentum after years of outperformance. Together, Hoka and Ugg account for the vast majority of Deckers' revenue and have been critical in offsetting weaknesses in other categories.CEO Dave Powers, however, downplayed fears of a long-term slowdown, telling investors that both brands remain strong among core consumers.\"We're confident in the long-term trajectory of our portfolio,\" Powers said. \"While tariffs and inflation are creating near-term pressure, Hoka and Ugg continue to lead in brand heat and market share gains across their categories.\"Beyond Hoka and Ugg, Deckers' full-year revenue guidance came in lower than analysts' expectations. In fiscal 2026, the company expects revenue of about $5.35 billion, shy of Wall Street's $5.45 billion forecast, according to LSEG. It expects earnings per share to be between $6.30 and $6.39, roughly in line with the $6.32 per share estimate, according to LSEG.In the company's call with analysts, Fasching warned that tariff costs could total about $150 million this fiscal year. Executives said they expect to offset roughly half of those costs through price adjustments and cost-sharing with factory partners.Deckers' shares have already dropped more than 55% year to date, leaving investors on edge about any signs of decelerating demand.",

    "body": "The Reliance Industries Ltd. oil refinery in Jamnagar, Gujarat, India, on Saturday, July 31, 2021.Bloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesIndia's largest private oil refiner Reliance Industries is reportedly halting purchases of Russian crude, following the U.S.' decision to sanction Russia's two largest oil companies, Rosneft and Lukoil.Reliance has become a major buyer of Russian crude. In September, it purchased around 629,590 barrels of Russian crude per day from the two firms, out of India's total imports of 1.6 million barrels per day, according to data by commodities data analytics firm Kpler.Over the same month last year, Reliance purchased around 428,000 barrels per day of oil from the Russian companies.In fact, India's Russian crude imports used to account for less than 3% of its total crude import basket, but today account for one-third of India's crude imports, experts say.Reliance has not responded to CNBC requests for comment on reports that it is stopping the purchase of Russian crude.It comes as the U.S. Treasury Department on Wednesday levied sanctions on Rosneft and Lukoil, citing Moscow's \"lack of serious commitment\" to ending the war in Ukraine. The sanctions aim to \"degrade\" the Kremlin's ability to finance its war, the U.S. department said, signaling more measures could follow.If Reliance does halt Russian purchases, it will have \"negative impacts on [Reliance's] margin and profitability as Russian crude constitute more than 50% of [its] crude diet,\" Pankaj Srivastava, SVP of commodity oil markets at market research firm Rystad Energy said in emailed comments.He added that the availability of \"similar crude is not an issue\" and can be sourced from West Asia, Brazil, or Guyana, but Reliance is unlikely to get the same price as it does on Russian crude, as it has long-term deals with suppliers like Rosneft.Last December, Reliance Industries signed a deal to import crude oil worth $12 billion-$13 billion a year from Russia's Rosneft for 10 years, which would translate to roughly 500,000 barrels per day, according to a report by Reuters.'Opportunistic buying'The purchase of Russian oil by Indian refiners was \"opportunistic buying\" driven by discounts versus comparable grades, said Vandana Hari of Vanda Insights.India bought 38% of Russia's crude exports in September, second only to China at 47% according to Helsinki-based think tank Centre for Energy and Clean Air.Hari added that Indian refineries can easily pivot to buying from sources with the trade-off being \"pressure on refining margins.\"Muyu Xu, senior crude oil analyst at Kpler, said the Indian refining giant might face some short-term issues as it looks to replace the Russian crude.\"Given the large volumes under the Reliance-Rosneft deal, we expect some short-term friction for Reliance in securing replacement barrels,\" says Muyu Xu, senior crude oil analyst at Kpler.She added that \"Russia's medium-sour Urals remains about $5–6/bbl [barrel] cheaper than Middle Eastern crude of similar quality.A report by Jefferies last month indicated that the impact of Reliance Industries moving away from Russian oil was \"manageable.\"The brokerage said in September that it had received queries from investors about the possible financial impact on Reliance if it halts its imports of Russian oil due to sanctions.The benefit of Russian crude accounts for around 2.1% of the firm's estimated consolidated EBITDA of 2.05 trillion rupees ($ 22.8 billion) for fiscal year 2027, the brokerage said.Reliance's consolidated EBITDA for the six months of fiscal year 2026 was 1.08 trillion Indian rupees ($12.3 billion), of which 295 billion rupees were from its oil-to-chemicals segment, while its telecom and retail ventures together contributed to nearly 500 billion rupees.Hopes of a U.S. trade dealOther Indian refiners are also looking to cut imports of Russian oil. Weaning off Russian oil might raise India's import bill, but it won't be \"as big a sticker shock as [it] might have been if crude was in the $70 or $80 range,\" said Hari of Vanda Insights.U.S. West Texas Intermediate futures were trading around $61.83 a barrel on Friday.Experts also say the benefits of India cutting back on Russian oil purchases outweigh the downsides.According to Natixis' Senior Economist Trinh Nguyen, the arbitrage that Russian oil offered during the energy crisis has tapered off, and there is no need for India now to have significant purchases of Russian oil.watch nowIndia's Russian crude purchase has been a sore point in its trade relations with the U.S., which culminated in the U.S. imposing a total 50% tariff on Indian goods exported to the U.S..With both state-owned and private refiners expected to halt purchase of Russian crude — a long-standing demand of U.S. President Donald Trump — the chances of India negotiating a mutually beneficial trade deal with the U.S. have increased.— CNBC's Ying Shan Lee contributed to this report ",

    "body": "watch nowProcter & Gamble on Friday reported fiscal first-quarter earnings and revenue that beat analysts' expectations, lifted by higher demand for its beauty and grooming products.Despite higher costs from tariffs and what CEO Jon Moeller called a \"challenging consumer and geopolitical environment,\" P&G reiterated its forecast for all-in sales and earnings for the fiscal year, which began in July.Here's what the company reported for the quarter that ended on Sept. 30 compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:Earnings per share: $1.99 adjusted vs. $1.90 expectedRevenue: $22.39 billion vs. $22.18 billion expectedP&G reported fiscal first-quarter net income attributable to the company of $4.75 billion, or $1.95 per share, up from $3.96 billion, or $1.61 per share, a year earlier.Excluding certain items, including costs associated with incremental restructuring, the consumer giant earned $1.99 per share.Net sales rose 3% to $22.39 billion. Organic sales — which strips out the impact of acquisitions, divestitures and foreign currency — increased 2% in the quarter.Though revenue metrics were higher, P&G's volume was flat compared with the year-ago period. Volume excludes pricing, which makes it a more accurate reflection of demand than sales. Like many consumer companies, P&G has seen demand for some of its products fall as inflation-weary consumers seek out deals.'K-shaped' shopping\"The consumer environment is not great, but stable,\" CFO Andre Schulten said on a call with media, adding that shoppers have behaved similarly in the last few quarters.In the United States, the company's largest market, consumption across P&G's broad swath of products has slowed \"a little bit,\" according to Schulten. Like Coca-Cola, P&G is seeing a bifurcation in how consumers are shopping based on their incomes, often described as a \"K-shaped\" economy.Shoppers who are less cash constrained are buying bigger pack sizes from club and online retailers, Schulten said.\"That's their way to look for value,\" he said.But U.S. consumers living paycheck to paycheck are looking to stretch their money further by using every bottle of detergent or shampoo to the last drop and exhausting their pantry inventory before shopping for more, according to Schulten.At the same time, private label brands are losing market share, bucking previous shopping trends during economic downturns, executives said on the company's conference call. After the recession in 2008, P&G shifted its strategy to create more premium products that couldn't be easily substituted with cheaper private label versions.Boxes of Tide Pods dishwasher detergent are displayed at a Costco Wholesale store on July 12, 2025 in San Diego, California. Kevin Carter | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesP&G reported Friday that volume for both its health care and fabric and home care divisions, which include Tide and Swiffer, fell 2% during the quarter.The company is seeing \"heightened competition\" in those categories, fueled by promotions and discounting from rivals, executives said on the conference call. To win back customers, P&G is focusing on innovation that can justify higher prices and convince shoppers that its products are superior. For example, Schulten said that Tide is starting shipments of its \"biggest upgrade to liquid detergent in 20 years.\"The company's baby, feminine and family care segment reported flat volume for the quarter. That division includes brands like Pampers and Tampax.P&G's beauty business was a bright spot. The division, which includes Olay and SK-II, reported volume growth of 4% and overall sales growth of 6%. Olay's Super Serum line was the brand's top performer, showing that customers were willing to pay more for premium skincare.And P&G's grooming business, which includes Gillette and Venus razors, saw volume rise 1% in the quarter for a sales increase of 5%.For fiscal 2026, the company is now projecting that President Donald Trump's tariffs will result in $400 million in after-tax costs, down from its prior outlook of $800 million. When P&G originally formulated its forecast, it included retaliatory tariffs on Canada, which have since been rescinded. As a result, the company is now planning a smaller raise in prices than it expected, Moeller said on CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" on Friday morning.However, Trump said on Thursday evening that he is terminating all trade talks with Canada over a TV ad, which could mean higher costs ahead for P&G.P&G also reiterated its fiscal 2026 forecast of sales growth between 1% and 5% and earnings per share in the range of $6.83 to $7.09.",

    "body": "New York Attorney General Letitia James speaks to the media, after she attended a hearing and pleaded not guilty to charges that she defrauded her mortgage lender, outside the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, in Norfolk, Virginia, U.S., October 24, 2025.Jonathan Ernst | ReutersNew York Attorney General Letitia James on Friday pleaded not guilty to federal charges in a fraud case tied to mortgage records she signed in 2020.James is a longtime antagonist of President Donald Trump, who publicly urged Attorney General Pam Bondi to target her weeks before she was indicted.James' case in U.S. District Court in Norfolk, Virginia, is set to head to trial on Jan. 26, 2026.\"This is not about me. This is about all of us,\" James said after leaving court, \"and about a justice system which has been weaponized\" and \"used as a tool of revenge.\"\"So there's no fear today,\" she said. \"I believe that justice will rain down like water and righteousness like a mighty stream.\"James, at her arraignment, pleaded not guilty to one count each of bank fraud and making false statements to a financial institution.James has decried the charges as \"baseless,\" calling her indictment \"nothing more than a continuation of the president's desperate weaponization of our justice system.\"Interim U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia Lindsey Halligan, in a highly unusual move, personally presented evidence about James to a grand jury before it issued the indictment. U.S. attorneys normally have assistant U.S. attorneys present evidence to grand juries.After Friday's arraignment, James' legal team filed a motion asking Judge Jamar Walker to dismiss the indictment on the grounds that Halligan \"had no authority to bring the charges in this case\" because she was invalidly appointed.Read more CNBC politics coverageTrump pardons convicted Binance founder Changpeng ZhaoChauncey Billups, others arrested in FBI probe linking NBA to Mafia gambling ringTrump to demolish entire East Wing of White House for ballroom: 'Plans changed'Government shutdown becomes 2nd longest in U.S. historyTrump special counsel nominee Paul Ingrassia withdraws after racist texts flapTrump says U.S. cattle ranchers 'don't understand' tariffs, must lower pricesOil jumps 3% after Trump administration sanctions big Russian oil companiesRussia was smug about Trump-Putin talks.

All Americans should speak out about the unjust prosecution of Letitia James,\" said Eisen, a vocal Trump critic who has been repeatedly criticized by the president.The indictment against James alleges that she made false representations in documents she signed when purchasing a three-bedroom home in Norfolk that was financed with a roughly $109,600 mortgage loan.A rider to that loan required James to occupy the home as a second residence and not rent it out. But the home \"was instead used as a rental investment property\" for a family of three, the indictment alleges.James' total purported \"ill-gotten gains\" were only about $19,000 over the life of the loan she received, according to the indictment. Most of that money was from savings James allegedly received from having a lower interest rate on the mortgage than what she would have paid if the home was classified as a rental investment property, the indictment says.Prosecutors who investigated James, in a September memo, said they found evidence that appeared to undercut the indictment's allegations, MSNBC's Ken Dilanian reported Friday.That evidence reportedly includes the amount that James stood to receive financially from her alleged mortgage misrepresentation: Only about $800 in the year that she bought the home.The prosecutors also questioned if the case could be proven beyond a reasonable doubt. ABC News first reported the memo on Thursday, citing sources.This is developing news. Please check back for updates.",

    "body": "A Target logo is displayed outside one of their stores on August 2, 2025 in San Diego, California. Kevin Carter | Getty ImagesTarget said on Thursday it's cutting 1,800 corporate jobs as the retailer tries to get back to growth after four years of roughly stagnant sales.It marks the first major round of layoffs in a decade for the Minneapolis-based retailer. It announced the layoffs in a memo sent by Target's incoming CEO Michael Fiddelke to employees at its headquarters.The eliminated roles are a combination of about 1,000 employee layoffs and about 800 positions that will no longer be filled, a company spokesman said. Together, they represent an approximately 8% cut to Target's corporate workforce, according to the memo. Affected employees will be notified Tuesday.The retailer announced the cuts as it nears a leadership change.Target in August named Fiddelke, currently its chief operating officer and formerly chief financial officer, as the successor to longtime leader Brian Cornell. He takes the helm February 1.Fiddelke has also overseen the Enterprise Acceleration Office, an effort announced in May, which looked for ways to simplify company operations, use technology in new ways and speed up Target's growth. Target has been fighting a sales slump, as it tries to rebound from declining store traffic, inventory troubles and customer backlash. The company has said it expects annual sales to decline this year. Its shares have fallen by 65% since their all-time high in late 2021.Compared to retail competitors, Target draws less of its overall sales from groceries and other necessities, which can make its business more vulnerable to the ups and downs of the economy and consumer sentiment. About half of Target's sales come from discretionary items, compared to only 40% at Walmart, according to estimates from GlobalData Retail.As a result of that and other company-specific challenges, Target's sales trends and stock performance have diverged sharply from competitors. Shares of Walmart are up about 123% in the past five years, compared to Target's decline of 41% during the same time period.In a memo sent Thursday to employees at Target's headquarters, Fiddelke said the employee cuts will help Target make urgent changes.\"The truth is, the complexity we've created over time has been holding us back,\" he said in the memo. \"Too many layers and overlapping work have slowed decisions, making it harder to bring ideas to life.\"He said the cuts are difficult, but \"a necessary step in building the future of Target and enabling the progress and growth we all want to see.\"   Target employees affected by the layoffs will receive pay and benefits until January 3, in addition to severance packages, according to a company spokesman. No roles in stores or in Target's supply chain were impacted by the cuts, the company spokesman said.Read the full memo from Fiddelke:Team, This spring, we launched our enterprise acceleration efforts with a clear ambition: to move faster and simplify how we work to drive Target's next chapter of growth. The truth is, the complexity we've created over time has been holding us back. Too many layers and overlapping work have slowed decisions, making it harder to bring ideas to life. On Tuesday, we'll share changes to our headquarters structure as an important step in accelerating how we work. This includes eliminating about 1,800 non-field roles — about 8% of our global HQ team. As we make these changes, I'm asking all U.S. HQ team members to work from home next week. Target in India and our other global teams will follow their in-office routines. Decisions that affect our team are the most significant ones we make, and we never make them lightly. I know the real impact this has on our team, and it will be difficult. And, it's a necessary step in building the future of Target and enabling the progress and growth we all want to see.   Adjusting our structure is one part of the work ahead of us. It will also require new behaviors and sharper priorities that strengthen our retail leadership in style and design and enable faster execution so we can: Lead with merchandising authority; Elevate the guest experience with every interaction; and Accelerate technology to enable our team and delight our guests. Put together, these changes set the course for our company to be stronger, faster and better positioned to serve guests and communities for many years to come. Michael ",

    "body": "Coke beverages are displayed in a 7-eleven convenient store on July 17, 2025 in Austin, Texas. Brandon Bell | Getty ImagesAmid recession fears, a government shutdown and tariff uncertainty, consumers are increasingly diverging in their spending.Wealthier Americans are engaging their purchasing power, while lower-income Americans are starting to pull back — commonly described as a \"K-shaped\" economy. Friday's consumer price index report shed more light on the pressures facing large swaths of the country.The CPI report, which measures price changes across a range of goods and services, was delayed due to the government shutdown, originally scheduled to be released nine days prior. The report came in cooler-than-expected, showing a 0.3% increase on the month. That put the annual inflation rate at 3% and signals a likely rate cut by the Federal Reserve next week.A subset of the CPI report also helps determine the Social Security Administration's cost-of-living adjustment, which the agency said Friday will be 2.8% in 2026.Lower- and middle-income consumers have been hit hardest by rising costs on daily essentials like groceries and gas. Meanwhile, wealthier investors have benefited from stock market rallies and rising home values. Recent data from JPMorgan's Cost of Living Survey found that income bracket was a large factor in Americans' varying views of the current state of the economy.Here's where bifurcation is beginning to take hold:Food and beverageCoca-Cola, often viewed as a bellwether for the financial health of consumer, has been seeing the divergence across its business.Pricier products that are more exposed to high-income consumers, like Topo Chico sparkling water and Fairlife protein shakes, are fueling the company's sales growth, CEO James Quincey told CNBC's \"Squawk on the Street\" Tuesday. At the same time, Coke is seeing higher demand at both dollar stores that cater to low-income consumers looking for deals and higher-end outlets that skew toward wealthier consumers, like fast-casual restaurants and amusement parks.McDonald's CEO Chris Kempczinski told CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" in early September that the burger chain's expansion of its value menu was in response to a divided consumer landscape, or what he called a \"two-tier economy.\"While Kempczinski said the company is seeing upper-income consumers performing well, its lower- and middle-income diners are \"a different story.\"\"Traffic for lower-income consumers is down double digits, and it's because people are either choosing to skip a meal... or they're choosing to just eat at home,\" he said last month.A similar dynamic is playing out at Chipotle, according to Chief Financial Officer Adam Rymer.\"There are certain cohorts of the consumer, definitely on the lower-income side, that are feeling pressure right now. That's something that we'll have to take into consideration when looking at price going forward,\" Rymer told Reuters in July.On Friday, Procter & Gamble said the company is seeing K-shaped shopping behaviors among its consumers, with wealthier shoppers buying bigger pack sizes from club retailers and lower-income shoppers exhausting their pantry inventory before returning to the stores.\"The consumer environment is not great, but stable,\" CFO Andre Schulten said on a call with reporters.Autos and airfareLast month, the average price for a new vehicle surpassed $50,000 for the first time ever, according to Cox Automotive's Kelley Blue Book.The record pricing comes as auto loan defaults and repossessions are on the rise, particularly for those with FICO scores below 620.\"Today's auto market is being driven by wealthier households who have access to capital, good loan rates and are propping up the higher end of the market,\" said Cox Automotive executive analyst Erin Keating in a statement last week.And though airlines have been piloting premium offerings for years, the higher-cost tickets have gained momentum in recent months.Delta Air Lines said earlier this month that revenue from its premium offerings is expected to surpass the coach cabin next year, with CEO Ed Bastian saying he's not seeing any signs of slowdown in the roomier, more expensive seats.HospitalityStill, though there are signs of a \"K-shaped\" economy, some argue it's not here to stay.Hilton CEO Christopher Nassetta told CNBC last month that he's seeing a bifurcation, but he doesn't expect that pattern to last much longer, partly because he sees inflation and interest rates decreasing.\"My own belief is that as we look into the fourth quarter and particularly into next year, we're going to see a very big shift in those dynamics, meaning, I don't think you're going to continue to have this bifurcation,\" Nassetta said. \"That's not to say I think the high end is going to get worse or bad, I just think the middle and the low end is going to move up.\"On Wednesday, the hotel chain reported a drop in revenue for affordable brands like Hampton by Hilton and Homewood Suites by Hilton.Meanwhile, Nassetta told investors on an earnings call that revenue from luxury offerings performed exceedingly well and remains a focus for Hilton moving forward.— CNBC's Amelia Lucas, Michael Wayland, Alex Harring, Luke Fountain and Leslie Josephs contributed to this report.",

    "body": "Ontario Premier Doug Ford speaks during a campaign stop at Walker Construction in Niagara Falls, Ontario, Canada, on Jan. 31, 2025.Carlos Osorio | ReutersOntario Premier Doug Ford clapped back Friday at President Donald Trump for terminating all trade negotiations with Canada over an ad that Ford's province has been running in the United States featuring former President Ronald Reagan criticizing tariffs.Trump late Thursday night cited a complaint about the ad by The Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation and Institute for his decision to end talks.\"TARIFFS ARE VERY IMPORTANT TO THE NATIONAL SECURITY, AND ECONOMY, OF THE U.S.A. Based on their egregious behavior, ALL TRADE NEGOTIATIONS WITH CANADA ARE HEREBY TERMINATED,\" Trump wrote in a Truth Social post.The Reagan foundation said that the ad misrepresents his radio address speech from April 25, 1987, and that the former president's remarks were edited without permission.watch nowIt encouraged people to listen to an unedited video of his address on its YouTube channel. The foundation did not say what was misleading about the Ontario ad, but noted it was reviewing its legal options.Ontario's ad correctly reflected the fact that Reagan, in his address, defended the concept of free trade. But the ad omitted the fact that Reagan was defending his decision to impose tariffs on imports from Japan.On Friday, Ford appeared to answer the foundation's criticism by tweeting a message that included a YouTube link from the Reagan Library to the same unedited video showing Reagan criticizing tariffs that the foundation had referenced.\"High tariffs inevitably lead to retaliation by foreign countries and the triggering of fierce trade wars,\" Reagan says on that clip, in which he also says tariffs result in \"artificially high\" prices.Ford wrote on his X post, \"Canada and the United States are friends, neighbours and allies.

Brian Snyder | ReutersTrump on Thursday accused the ad of misleadingly saying that Reagan disliked tariffs \"when actually he LOVED TARIFFS FOR OUR COUNTRY, AND ITS NATIONAL SECURITY.\"\"The Ronald Reagan Foundation has just announced that Canada has fraudulently used an advertisement, which is FAKE, featuring Ronald Reagan speaking negatively about Tariffs,\" Trump wrote.He claimed that the ad was intended to influence a pending U.S. Supreme Court case that could doom many of his wide-ranging tariffs, including ones on Canada.Read more CNBC politics coverageTrump pardons convicted Binance founder Changpeng ZhaoChauncey Billups, others arrested in FBI probe linking NBA to Mafia gambling ringTrump to demolish entire East Wing of White House for ballroom: 'Plans changed'Government shutdown becomes 2nd longest in U.S. historyTrump special counsel nominee Paul Ingrassia withdraws after racist texts flapTrump says U.S. cattle ranchers 'don't understand' tariffs, must lower pricesOil jumps 3% after Trump administration sanctions big Russian oil companiesRussia was smug about Trump-Putin talks.

    "body": "ESPN and YouTube TV.David Buono | Icon Sportswire | Jaque Silva | NurPhoto | Getty ImagesJust a month after reaching an agreement with NBCUniversal to avoid dropping its networks, YouTube TV has another potential blackout on its hands — this time with Disney.Disney said Thursday it would begin running public messages for YouTube TV subscribers to alert customers that the company's networks, including ABC and ESPN, will be dropped from the service if the two sides can't reach a new distribution agreement, which expires October 30 at 11:59 p.m. ET.\"This is the latest example of Google exploiting its position at the expense of their own customers,\" a Disney spokesperson said in a statement. \"If we don't reach a fair deal soon, YouTube TV customers will lose access to ESPN and ABC, and all our marquee programming — including the NFL, college football, NBA and NHL seasons — and so much more.\"Disney began running public announcements on YouTube TV at 5 p.m. ET.As with NBCUniversal, YouTube TV is asking for better rates for Disney's programming, according to people familiar with the discussions. YouTube TV has about 10 million subscribers and wants more favorable terms given their scale, the people said.\"We've been working in good faith to negotiate a deal with Disney that pays them fairly for their content on YouTube TV,\" a spokesperson for the service said in a statement. \"Unfortunately, Disney is proposing costly economic terms that would raise prices on YouTube TV customers and give our customers fewer choices, while benefiting Disney's own live TV products - like Hulu + Live TV and, soon, Fubo. Without an agreement, we'll have to remove Disney's content from YouTube TV and if it remains unavailable for an extended period of time, we will offer subscribers a $20 credit.\"Get the CNBC Sport newsletter directly to your inboxThe CNBC Sport newsletter with Alex Sherman brings you the biggest news and exclusive interviews from the worlds of sports business and media, delivered weekly to your inbox.Subscribe here to get access today.YouTube TV and NBCUniversal first reached a temporary extension to avoid a blackout before inking a finalized deal a few days later.Two years ago, Disney reached an unusual distribution agreement with Charter, the largest U.S. pay TV provider by subscribers, that gave certain Charter subscribers access to Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+ for no extra charge. Disney is willing to offer YouTube TV the same terms as that Charter agreement, two of the people said.YouTube TV is again asking to ingest Disney's streaming content, giving customers the ability to view programming on Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+ without leaving the YouTube platform, according to a person familiar with the negotiations. YouTube TV also asked for this in its negotiations with NBCUniversal and was rejected. Similarly, Disney has no plans to say yes to this request, according to people familiar with the company's thinking.The clash between Disney and YouTube has an added element of conflict. YouTube hired away former Disney distribution executive Justin Connolly earlier this year, prompting Disney to file a breach of contract lawsuit. Connolly has recused himself from these discussions, according to the people familiar with the process.Disclosure: Comcast is the parent company of NBCUniversal, which owns CNBC. Versant would become the new parent company of CNBC upon Comcast's planned spinoff of Versant.",

    "body": "U.S. President Donald Trump hosts a Rose Garden Club lunch at the White House in Washington, D.C., U.S., Oct. 21, 2025.  Kevin Lamarque | ReutersPresident Donald Trump said overnight that he was abruptly ending all trade negotiations with Canada because of an advertisement from Ontario's government that criticized U.S. tariffs using former President Ronald Reagan's words.Trump, in a Truth Social post announcing the termination of the talks, cited a statement from the Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation & Institute claiming that Ontario's ad \"misrepresents\" what Reagan said in a 1987 address on tariffs.\"They only did this to interfere with the decision of the U.S. Supreme Court,\" wrote Trump, referring to a major pending case that threatens to cancel some of his biggest tariffs.The Reagan foundation's reaction has drawn criticism from some who say that the organization is itself twisting the former president's clearly tariff-critical message.\"Incredible cynicism and betrayal of Reagan by his own foundation,\" Dartmouth economics professor Paul Novosad said in an X post. \"If anyone actually clicked through to listen to the real address, they would see he says exactly what the Ontario ad claims!\"The Canadian ad, unveiled in mid-October by Ontario Premier Doug Ford, edits together a half-dozen snippets of audio from Reagan's speech on free and fair trade delivered at Camp David, Maryland, on April 25, 1987.In the speech, Reagan defends his administration's decision to place tariffs on Japan in retaliation for the country's alleged failure to enforce their trade agreement on semiconductors with the U.S. He goes on to defend free trade and explain his general opposition to tariffs, even while imposing them in \"certain select cases.\"Ford defended the ad Friday morning, writing, \"President Ronald Reagan knew that we are stronger together.\"The Reagan Foundation's statement encouraged people to watch an unedited video of the former president's speech.Transcripts of both the Canadian ad and Reagan's remarks are below. The words that were used in the ad are highlighted in the full speech transcript.Ontario's ad:When someone says, 'Let's impose tariffs on foreign imports,' it looks like they're doing the patriotic thing by protecting American products and jobs. And sometimes, for a short while, it works — but only for a short time.Over the long run, such trade barriers hurt every American worker and consumer.High tariffs inevitably lead to retaliation by foreign countries and the triggering of fierce trade wars.Then the worst happens: Markets shrink and collapse; businesses and industries shut down; and millions of people lose their jobs.Throughout the world, there's a growing realization that the way to prosperity for all nations is rejecting protectionist legislation and promoting fair and free competition.America's jobs, and growth, are at stake.Reagan's speech:My fellow Americans:Prime Minister Nakasone of Japan will be visiting me here at the White House next week. It's an important visit, because, while I expect to take up our relations with our good friend Japan, which overall remain excellent, recent disagreements between our two countries on the issue of trade will also be high on our agenda.As perhaps you've heard, last week I placed new duties on some Japanese products in response to Japan's inability to enforce their trade agreement with us on electronic devices called semiconductors. Now, imposing such tariffs or trade barriers and restrictions of any kind are steps that I am loath to take. And in a moment I'll mention the sound economic reasons for this: that over the long run, such trade barriers hurt every American worker and consumer. But the Japanese semiconductors were a special case. We had clear evidence that Japanese companies were engaging in unfair trade practices that violated an agreement between Japan and the United States. We expect our trading partners to live up to their agreements. As I've often said: Our commitment to free trade is also a commitment to fair trade.But you know, in imposing these tariffs, we were just trying to deal with a particular problem, not begin a trade war. So, next week I'll be giving Prime Minister Nakasone this same message: We want to continue to work cooperatively on trade problems, and want very much to lift these trade restrictions as soon as evidence permits. We want to do this, because we feel both Japan and the United States have an obligation to promote the prosperity and economic development that only free trade can bring.Now, that message of free trade is one I conveyed to Canada's leaders a few weeks ago, and it was warmly received there. Indeed, throughout the world, there's a growing realization that the way to prosperity for all nations is rejecting protectionist legislation and promoting fair and free competition. Now, there are sound historical reasons for this. For those of us who lived through the Great Depression, the memory of the suffering it caused is deep and searing. And today, many economic analysts and historians argue that high tariff legislation passed back in that period, called the Smoot-Hawley tariff, greatly deepened the depression and prevented economic recovery.You see, at first, when someone says, 'Let's impose tariffs on foreign imports,' it looks like they're doing the patriotic thing by protecting American products and jobs. And sometimes, for a short while, it works — but only for a short time. What eventually occurs is: First, homegrown industries start relying on government protection in the form of high tariffs. They stop competing and stop making the innovative management and technological changes they need to succeed in world markets. And then, while all this is going on, something even worse occurs. High tariffs inevitably lead to retaliation by foreign countries and the triggering of fierce trade wars. The result is more and more tariffs, higher and higher trade barriers, and less and less competition. So, soon, because of the prices made artificially high by tariffs that subsidize inefficiency and poor management, people stop buying. Then the worst happens: Markets shrink and collapse; businesses and industries shut down; and millions of people lose their jobs.The memory of all this occurring back in the thirties made me determined when I came to Washington to spare the American people the protectionist legislation that destroys prosperity. Now, it hasn't always been easy. There are those in the Congress, just as there were back in the thirties, who want to go for the quick political advantage, who will risk America's prosperity for the sake of a short-term appeal to some special interest group, who forget that more than 5 million American jobs are directly tied to the foreign export business and additional millions are tied to imports. Well, I've never forgotten those jobs. And on trade issues, by and large, we've done well. In certain select cases, like the Japanese semiconductors, we've taken steps to stop unfair practices against American products, but we've still maintained our basic, long-term commitment to free trade and economic growth.So, with my meeting with Prime Minister Nakasone and the Venice economic summit coming up, it's terribly important not to restrict a president's options in such trade dealings with foreign governments. Unfortunately, some in the Congress are trying to do exactly that. I'll keep you informed on this dangerous legislation, because it's just another form of protectionism and I may need your help to stop it. Remember, America's jobs, and growth, are at stake.Until next week, thanks for listening, and God bless you.",

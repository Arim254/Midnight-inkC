Brendan McDermid | ReutersWaymo is starting to take San Francisco passengers to the airport.The Alphabet-owned company said in a blog post Thursday that it is opening up San Francisco International Airport access to a select number of customers, and will gradually welcome all riders over the coming months. Pickups and drop-offs will initially take place at the airport's rental car center, and will eventually expand to additional locations like terminals. Waymo began driving passengers on freeways late last year, a necessary step to move into airport transportation. \"Serving rides to and from San Francisco International Airport delivers one of the most requested features for our riders and further deepens our relationship with the city,\" Waymo co-CEO Tekedra Mawakana said in a blog post. \"With millions traveling in for major events this year, we look forward to meeting the growing demand for reliable, fully autonomous rides.\"SFO marks Waymo's third major airport, as the company moves further into territory that's been dominated in recent years by Uber and Lyft.

    "body": "A view of Oslo seen from the roof of the Oslo Opera House in Oslo, Norway, on Thursday, Oct. 21, 2021.Bloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesNorway's $2 trillion sovereign wealth fund made $247 billion in 2025, its management team said Thursday, thanks to rallying tech, financial and mining stocks.The fund posted annual profit of 2.36 trillion kronor, or $246.9 billion. By the end of last year, the fund's total value stood at 21.27 trillion Norwegian kroner Over the course of 2025, the fund returned 13.5 trillion kronor — its highest annual return since the fund's inception in the nineties.The overall return was 0.28 percentage points lower than the return on its benchmark index. Equities, which make up about 71% of the fund's investments, returned 19.3% last year. Norges Bank Investment Management (NBIM) manages the fund on behalf of the Norwegian population. Set up in the 1990s to invest excess revenues from Norway's oil and gas industry, the fund is currently an investor in more than 7,000 companies across 60 countries.Its most valuable investments include a 1.3% stake in Nvidia, a 1.2% stake in Apple and a 1.3% stake in Microsoft. \"Stocks in technology, financials and basic materials stood out, making a significant contribution to the overall return\", Nicolai Tangen, NBIM's CEO, said in a statement on Thursday.NBIM's holdings in the basic materials sector include mining giant Fresnillo — the best-performing stock on London's FTSE 100 last year, which surged 452.5% amid a silver boom and its acquisition of Probe Gold.In the financial sector, NBIM holds significant stakes in Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs. The fund also has various holdings in global lenders, including European banking giants Santander, UBS, HSBC and UniCredit. Europe's banking sector has been a source of major returns for investors in recent years.Outside equities, NBIM's fixed income investments returned 5.4% in 2025, while unlisted real estate returned 4.4%. Its renewable energy infrastructure holdings returned 18.1% last year. Read moreThe fund increased in value by 1.53 trillion kroner — around $159.9 billion — in 2025.White House clash While the fund's returns were positive in 2025, some of its decisions drew criticism — notably from the White House.In September, the U.S. State Department told CNBC it was \"very troubled\" by fund's decision to exit positions in American machinery manufacturer Caterpillar and five Israeli banks, citing \"unacceptable risk\" that the companies were contributing to rights violations in Palestinian territories.A spokesperson argued NBIM's Caterpillar exit \"appears to be based on illegitimate claims against Caterpillar and the Israeli government.\"Norway's finance minister, Jens Stoltenberg, later said the divestment was \"not a political decision.\"American equities account for 38.8% of all the fund's investments.Stoltenberg told Bloomberg last week that he saw no reason for the fund to exit the United States.\"Our presence in the United States reflects the size of the U.S. market. And I think that's the best way for a very long-term fund,\" he said at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.Correction: The headline and text of this article have been updated to correct a conversion error when reporting the fund's return in US dollars.",

    "body": "Apple CEO Tim Cook gestures as he departs after a business leaders reception with the US President on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum (WEF) annual meeting in Davos on January 21, 2026. Fabrice Coffrini | Afp | Getty ImagesApple reported fiscal first-quarter earnings on Thursday that surpassed expectations, with revenue soaring 16% on an annual basis.  Shares of the company were up more than 1% in extended trading. Here are the results versus what Wall Street was expecting, according to LSEG consensus estimates for the quarter ending in December: EPS: $2.84 vs. $2.67 estimated Revenue: $143.76 billion vs. $138.48 billion estimated Here is how Apple performed versus LSEG consensus estimates:  iPhone revenue: $85.27 billion vs. $78.65 billion estimatedMac revenue: $8.39 billion vs. $8.95 billion estimated iPad revenue: $8.60 billion vs. $8.13 billion estimated Wearables, Home and Accessories revenue: $11.49 billion vs. $12.04 billion estimated Services revenue: $30.01 billion vs. $30.07 billion estimatedGross margin: 48.2% vs. 47.5% estimated Finance chief Kevan Parekh said that Apple expects revenue this quarter to rise between 13% and 16% on an annual basis, which would be equivalent to between $107.8 billion and $110.66 billion. Analysts polled by LSEG were expecting $104.84 billion. Apple said it expects constrained iPhone supply during the period. Apple also said it expects its Services unit to have a year-over-year growth rate similar to the 14% in the December quarter. The company reported $42.1 billion in net income, or $2.84 per share, versus $36.33 billion, or $2.40 per  share, in the year-ago period.  Overall iPhone revenue surged 23% on an annual basis to $85.27 billion, which the company attributed to strong sales of the iPhone 17 models released in September.  \"The demand for iPhone was just simply staggering,\" Apple CEO Tim Cook told CNBC's Steve Kovach. The strong growth is a reversal from the holiday quarter last year, when Apple reported iPhone sales that declined slightly. Cook said Apple now has an active base of 2.5 billion iPhones, Macs and other Apple devices, up from 2.35 billion announced in January last year. That number is closely watched because it points to the addressable market for Apple services, as well as for software on the company's platforms.  Apple saw particularly strong results in China, including Taiwan and Hong Kong. Sales in the region surged 38% during the quarter to $25.53 billion. Cook said that the performance in the region was driven by iPhone sales.  \"We set an all-time record for upgraders in mainland China, and we saw double-digit growth on switchers,\" Cook said. Upgraders refers to current iPhone users who bought newer models, and switchers means new customers who previously had phones from different brands.  In China, Apple \"saw a lift that, frankly, was much greater than we thought we would see,\" Cook said, adding that it was \"product-driven.\" Apple's sales of Mac laptops came up short of Wall Street expectations, and fell 7% on an annual basis. The company released an updated MacBook Pro laptop with a new M4 chip in November.The iPad business grew 6% in the quarter on an annual basis to $8.6 billion in revenue, beating expectations. Cook said that half of the people who bought an iPad during the quarter had not previously owned one.  The company reports AirPods, Apple Watch, Vision Pro and other accessories in a category called Wearables, Home and Accessories. Those sales fell 2% on an annual basis and missed Wall Street estimates.  Apple's services business includes subscriptions such as Apple TV and iCloud as well as advertising revenue from licensing agreements with Google, AppleCare warranties and other offerings. It grew 14% on an annual basis to $26.34 billion in sales. Cook said Apple TV's viewership rose 36% in December from a year ago.Earlier this month, the company announced it would partner with Google to use its Gemini AI model to power Apple Intelligence software. Apple has spent much less on artificial intelligence technology than its peers, such as Meta and Microsoft, which have committed to spending hundreds of billions on AI infrastructure.  \"We have absolutely the best platforms in the world for AI,\" Cook said.  Apple recorded $2.37 billion in capital expenditures for the quarter, down from $2.94 billion in the same period last year. But research and development expenses increased to $10.89 billion from $8.27 billion in the year-ago period.  \"AI is going to require incremental investment on top of our normal product road map investment,\" Parekh said. All of Apple's devices, including the iPhone, Mac and iPad, use a lot of storage and memory, raising questions about how the company plans to handle increased component costs as memory prices around the world are surging because of an AI-related shortage.  \"We're in a supply chain mode to meet the very high levels of customer demand we're currently constrained,\" Cook said. \"At this point, it's difficult to predict when supply and demand will balance.\"Cook added that one of the constraints was with the advanced chip manufacturing needed for Apple's processors. He also said that memory prices had a minimal impact during the quarter, but the company expects a bigger effect during the current period \"We do continue to see market pricing for memory increasing significantly,\" Cook said. Parekh said that Apple spent nearly $32 billion in the quarter on share repurchases and dividends. WATCH: Apple told us all about its new iPhone chips and on-device AI plans ",

The move trimmed the technology company's market cap by $357 billion, leaving it at $3.22 trillion by the end of Thursday trading.The iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector exchange-traded fund tumbled 5% on Thursday, while the technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite index finished the day down 0.7%. Not all of technology went down, though. Meta shares spiked 10% after impressing analysts with robust results and quarterly revenue guidance on Wednesday.Investors found a few imperfections in Microsoft's report. The all-important growth statistic for Azure and other cloud services came in at 39%, below StreetAccount's 39.4% consensus. The company called for about $12.6 billion in fiscal third-quarter revenue from the More Personal Computing segment that includes Windows, lower than StreetAccount's $13.7 billion consensus, and the implied operating margin for the new quarter also came up short.Microsoft's finance chief, Amy Hood, argued that the cloud result could have been higher if it had allocated more data center infrastructure to customers rather than prioritizing its in-house needs.\"If I had taken the GPUs that just came online in Q1 and Q2 in terms of GPUs and allocated them all to Azure, the KPI would have been over 40,\" she said.Read more CNBC tech newsA Waymo hit a child near an elementary school.

Analysts at UBS led by Karl Keirstead questioned Microsoft's choice to secure artificial intelligence computing capacity for products such as the Microsoft 365 Copilot productivity software add-on that has yet to succeed as much as OpenAI's ChatGPT.\"M365 revs growth is not accelerating due to Copilot, many checks on Copilot don't suggest a strong usage ramp (we plan to refresh our own checks in case we've missed a usage ramp) and the model market appears crowded and capital-intensive,\" the UBS analysts wrote. \"We think Microsoft needs to 'prove' that these are good investments.\"The negativity wasn't universal across Wall Street. Bernstein analysts led by Mark Moerdler, with the equivalent of a buy rating on Microsoft shares, applauded Microsoft's decision-making.\"Investors need, we believe, to understand that management made a cognizant decision to focus on what is best for the company long term rather than driving the stock up this quarter or even over last quarter and a few quarters to come (as capacity constraints likely abate),\" the analysts wrote in a Thursday note.Hood called for capital expenditures to decline slightly in the current quarter.WATCH: 'AI is eating software', says Melius' Ben Reitzeswatch now",

Samuel Corum | Getty ImagesPresident Donald Trump said Thursday that he will be naming his pick Friday for the new Federal Reserve chair.Speaking at the premiere for \"Melania,\" the film about first lady Melania Trump, the president said a process that began last summer of finding his pick to succeed current Chair Jerome Powell is about to end.\"I'll be announcing the Fed chair tomorrow morning,\" Trump said. Asked if he had actually settled on a choice, he replied, \"I do, I better, otherwise I have to go to work very quickly.\"The process for deciding on Powell's replacement began in September with an 11-candidate field that included past and current Fed officials, economists and Wall Street investment professionals. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent screened the qualifying candidates, whittling the list down to five and then four. The final four is believed to be former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh, National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett, current Fed Governor Christopher Waller and BlackRock chief investment officer for fixed income Rick Rieder.Prediction markets have been betting on who gets the job. Hassett had been the leader for some time, then Warsh and for the past several days Rieder. However, that flipped Thursday evening, with Kalshi now putting Warsh as a prohibitive 80% favorite.Trump added that the pick is \"somebody that could have been there a few years ago.\" Warsh is known to have been in the running back in 2017 when Trump decided to nominate Powell. An administration source told CNBC that Warsh was at the White House on Thursday. However, a White House official dismissed speculation.\"President Trump will make an announcement about his pick for the Federal Reserve at the appropriate juncture. Any and all reporting on the Federal Reserve Chairman nominations process until then is a waste of everyone's time,\" said White House spokesman Kush Desai.For his part, Powell balked at questions over whether he will stay on after his term as chair expires in May. Powell has the option of serving out the remaining two years on his governor's term.watch now",

    "body": "Iman Rachman, chief executive officer of the Indonesia Stock Exchange (IDX), speaks to members of the media in Jakarta, Indonesia, on Friday, Jan 30, 2026. Rachman said he will step down following a two-day market rout sparked by MSCI Inc.'s warning of a possible downgrade. Bloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesIndonesian stock exchange CEO Iman Rachman resigned on Friday, following a rout that saw the country's share market lose $84 billion over the past two days on concerns over a possible downgrade by index provider MSCI.In a release, the Indonesian Stock Exchange said Rachman had stepped down, taking responsibility for \"recent market condition,\" without elaborating. At a press conference Rachman said that \"I hope this is the best decision for the capital market. May my resignation lead to improvements in our capital market,\" according to Reuters.  \"Hopefully, the index, which opened positively this morning, will continue to improve in the coming days,\" he added. MSCI on Tuesday warned of a potential downgrade of the country to \"frontier\" market status, from emerging market by MSCI, highlighting concerns over trading transparency.   \"Investors highlighted that fundamental investability issues persist due to ongoing opacity in shareholding structures and concerns about possible coordinated trading behaviour that undermines proper price formation,\" MSCI said late Tuesday.The Jakarta Composite rose 1.18% on Friday, after losing 7.35% on Wednesday and another 1.06% on Thursday.A day before his resignation, Rachman told CNBC that Indonesian regulators had held discussions with MSCI, focused around enhancing data transparency, particularly around free float and ownership structures. watch nowOn Thursday, Indonesia's financial regulator said it would double the free float requirement on listed firms to 15%, responding to MSCI concerns about transparency on the country's stock exchange, according to Reuters. The IDX on Wednesday released a statement saying that it recognized the feedback by MSCI as a \"valuable part\" of its efforts aimed at enhancing the credibility of Indonesia's capital market. \"We are fully committed to making our best efforts to increase the weighting of Indonesian equities in the MSCI indices,\" IDX said. Speaking to CNBC's JP Ong, Pandu Sjahrir, chief investment officer at sovereign wealth fund Danatara, said that \"what happened the last two days is almost like a good cold plunge...the market kind of panicked a bit. And what happens after a cold plunge? Usually, you fix yourself up and you become refreshed.\"Indonesia's market has about one billion dollars in liquidity per day, Pandu said, adding that the market needed a liquidity of 8 to 10 times that amount. \"The only way to do it is through transparency. We have to be able to listen to what the market says, and don't be defensive.\"watch now",

The Waymo collision occurred within two blocks of an elementary school during normal school drop-off hours, while other children, a crossing guard and several double-parked vehicles were nearby. \"The child ran across the street from behind a double-parked SUV towards the school and was struck by the Waymo AV,\" NHTSA said in a document describing the incident that necessitated their \"preliminary evaluation.\"The vehicle was running on Waymo's 5th Generation Automated Driving System with no human safety supervisor in the vehicle. NHTSA's Office of Defects Investigations plans to assess \"whether the Waymo AV exercised appropriate caution given, among other things, its proximity to the elementary school during drop off hours, and the presence of young pedestrians and other potential vulnerable road users.\" The agency's investigation will include analysis of the \"intended behavior\" of Waymo's driverless vehicles in school zones and neighboring areas, especially during normal school pick-up and drop-off times, as well as the company's post-impact response.\"Our technology immediately detected the individual as soon as they began to emerge from behind the stopped vehicle. The Waymo Driver braked hard, reducing speed from approximately 17 mph to under 6 mph before contact was made,\" Waymo said in a statement on their blog.The company wrote that a fully attentive human driver in the same situation would have likely \"made contact with the pedestrian\" at a higher speed of 14 miles per hour.\"This significant reduction in impact speed and severity is a demonstration of the material safety benefit of the Waymo Driver,\" the company said.Read more CNBC tech newsA Waymo hit a child near an elementary school.

The company also reported that its vehicle \"remained stopped, moved to the side of the road, and stayed there until law enforcement cleared the vehicle to leave the scene.\"Waymo was involved in a separate incident on Jan. 25 in Los Angeles, where one of its Zeekr vehicles sped through a one-way residential street near Dodger Stadium. The vehicle struck several parked cars, including one that had a person in it.There were no reported injuries, Waymo said in an emailed response.The vehicle was being operated in manual mode by a human specialist at the time of the event. Waymo did not respond to questions about how the vehicle ended up speeding in the incident.Waymo is already facing regulatory scrutiny for the behavior of its robotaxis around school buses. Last week, the National Transportation Safety Board initiated an investigation after reports of Waymo robotaxis illegally passing stopped school buses in several different locations. In a statement posted on X on January 23, the NTSB said it \"opened a safety investigation to examine the interaction between Waymo vehicles and school buses stopped for loading and unloading students in Austin, Texas.\"The Austin Independent School District previously identified at least 19 incidents where Waymo vehicles passed its school buses, and demanded that Waymo stop using its driverless vehicles during school bus hours in Austin until the safety concerns could be resolved.NHTSA had earlier started \"to investigate the performance of the Waymo ADS around stopped school buses and the system's ability to follow traffic safety laws concerning school buses,\" it said in a letter the agency sent to Waymo.While both the NTSB and NHTSA are vehicle safety watchdogs in the U.S. government, their roles are distinct.The NTSB investigates accidents to determine underlying causes of damaging or concerning incidents. The board also makes safety recommendations to regulators (including NHTSA) and the auto industry.-- CNBC's Jennifer Elias contributed to this reportWATCH: 2025: The year that the robotaxi went mainstream with Waymo leading the packwatch now",

    "body": "An apartment for rent sign hangs outside of an apartment building on Dec. 4, 2025 in San Francisco, California. Justin Sullivan | Getty ImagesApartment rents continued their slide into the new year, as fresh supply still makes its way through the market, and landlords strive to gain pricing power over a struggling consumer. The national median rent in January was $1,353, a drop of 1.4% compared with one year ago, according to Apartment List. This is now the fourth consecutive winter with a \"pronounced\" offseason dip, and is the largest annual drop since September 2023 and the lowest January rent since 2022. Rents are now 6.2% lower than their last peak in the summer of 2022. The national vacancy rate was 7.3% in January, a record high on Apartment List's index, which dates to 2017. Units are also taking an average of 41 days to get leased, four days more than in January 2025 and another high for the index. \"Early last year, it appeared that annual rent growth was on track to flip positive for the first time since mid-2023; however, that rebound stalled out and reversed course during a slow summer moving season that has now dragged into the winter,\" wrote Chris Salviati, chief economist at Apartment List.The record supply of new apartment units has peaked, but there is still a good amount coming through the pipeline. That is coming up against weaker demand because of a tighter job market and slower household formation.

Markets in the Northeast, Midwest and parts of the West Coast continue to see rising rents despite the general winter slowdown.Austin, Texas, wins the dubious distinction of the softest rental market in the nation, with the median rent there down 6.3% from the year before. It is followed by New Orleans; San Antonio; Tucson, Arizona; and Denver.Virginia Beach, Virginia, is seeing the fastest rent growth at 5%. It is followed by San Jose and San Francisco, California; Chicago; and Providence, Rhode Island.\"The wave of construction that has been driving these conditions is waning, but whether or not market conditions shift will now depend on rental demand, whose outlook has grown shakier due to weakness in the labor market and general economic uncertainty,\" Salviati wrote.

    "body": "Elon Musk, CEO of SpaceX and Tesla, attends the Viva Technology conference at the Porte de Versailles exhibition center in Paris on June 16, 2023.Gonzalo Fuentes | ReutersAt Tesla's factory in Fremont, California, the automaker plans to make robots instead of its older cars, as it gears up to spend $20 billion this year to fund what it views as a business transformation.\"Forget the Tesla you knew,\" wrote analysts at Canaccord Genuity, in a note following Tesla's fourth-quarter earnings report. \"The Tesla of yesterday is gone. We believe Elon Musk has reached a definitive 'burn the ships' inflection point — a total commitment to a vision that leaves no room for retreat.\" The analysts recommend buying the stock. After capital expenditures dropped 24% last year to $8.6 billion, Tesla indicated on Wednesday that the figure will more than double in 2026 as the company shifts business away from electric vehicles, and further into artificial intelligence, with a focus on driverless technology, humanoid robots and, eventually, the chips that underpin these long-promised ambitions.Tesla shares dropped 3.5% to close at $417.89, bringing their January drop to more than 7%. Automotive revenue, which still accounts for about 70% of Tesla's business, declined 10% in 2025, as the company failed to offer new EV models and faced heightened competition across the globe, especially from China's BYD and Volkswagen and BMW in Europe. Total revenue at Tesla fell last year for the first time on record. watch nowOn the earnings call following the  report, Musk said the company is ending production of its Model S sedan and Model X SUVs, which combined made up less than 3% of the company's delivery volume last year, but helped Tesla make EVs mainstream.Musk said the lines that were producing those models in Fremont will be converted into a factory for building Optimus robots, which have yet to hit the market. The company has touted Optimus as a bipedal, intelligent robot that will someday be capable of everything from factory work to surgery and babysitting. He admitted that Optimus is still not in usage in Tesla factories in a \"material way.\"In 2024, Musk said Optimus could eventually make Tesla a $25 trillion company (the market cap sits at $1.4 trillion today) and last year said that 80% of Tesla's value will eventually come from the robots. Tesla didn't specify on this week's earnings call how much of the $20 billion in capex this year will be dedicated to Optimus. CFO Vaibhav Taneja said the money will go towards initiatives at six factories, including a refinery for making battery storage, as well as towards development of its driverless Cybercab, Semi electric truck and Optimus factory. \"On top of it, we'll also be spending money for building our AI compute infrastructure, and we'll continue investing in our existing factories to build more capacity and then also the related infrastructure to go along with it,\" Taneja said.  'Early stages of Optimus'While Musk said that the company is planning to spin up a production line for Optimus that can build a million units per year, he acknowledged that, \"we're still very much at the early stages of Optimus,\" and referred to it as a research and development project. \"We wouldn't expect to have any kind of significant Optimus production volume until probably end of this year,\" said Musk, who is notorious for missing self-imposed deadlines. In addition to its Optimus pursuits, Tesla plans to expand its Robotaxi ride-hailing fleet in the U.S., and is still working to to fulfill its decade-old promise to deliver a self-driving system that makes its cars safe to use without a human driver ready to steer or brake at any time.In 2025, Tesla launched a Robotaxi-branded ride-hailing app, and has been running a pilot service in Austin, Texas. Last week, Tesla executives said they had taken human safety supervisors out of a handful of cars in the Austin fleet to conduct driverless passenger rides. The company also started a service in the San Francisco area last year, but with a driver at the wheel. The company said in its investor deck on Wednesday that it plans to have coverage in seven additional U.S. markets in the first half of this year. Those cities are Dallas, Houston, Phoenix, Miami, Orlando, Tampa and Las Vegas.A Tesla Optimus robot hands out candy in front of the Nasdaq MarketSite in New York, US, on Monday, Oct. 27, 2025. Michael Nagle | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesIn addition to all the technical challenges and financial commitments involved with robots and driverless cars, Tesla faces hefty competition in both areas. Alphabet's Waymo is rapidly expanding its robotaxi service in the U.S., while Baidu's Apollo Go is growing in China. And in robots, Apptronik and Boston Dynamics are among the U.S. players, with companies like Unitree and Agibot in China.One other area where Musk said the company expects to spend big is in chips. He said key suppliers like Samsung, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. and Micron can't possibly produce enough hardware to satisfy Tesla's needs.\"In order to remove the constraint, the probable constraint in three or four years, we're going to have to build a Tesla TeraFab, a very big fab that includes logic, memory and packaging domestically,\" Musk said. \"And that's actually also going to be very important to ensure that we are protected against any geopolitical risks.\"He added that, \"We're going to be paranoid and make sure that we can continue to build batteries and robots and AI chips no matter what happens.\"The spending target for this year doesn't include any TeraFab plans, Taneja said. Nor does it account for Musk's vision to begin solar cell manufacturing in the U.S. Analysts at Barclays, who recommend holding Tesla's stock, wrote in a report on Thursday that while autos may still be the company's core business, the end of the Model S and X \"marks the symbolic baton pass\" into \"physical AI.\" \"In case it wasn't clear before, it's more than abundantly clear now that Tesla is not an auto company,\" the analysts wrote.

    "body": "Andy Jassy, CEO of Amazon, speaking with CNBC at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Jan. 20, 2026.CNBCAmazon is in talks to invest up to $50 billion in OpenAI, CNBC confirmed on Thursday, in a significant vote of confidence from the e-commerce giant after it invested in one of the startup's biggest rivals.OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and Amazon CEO Andy Jassy have been engaging in direct discussions, according to a source familiar with the matter who asked not to be named because the details are confidential. Amazon has pumped billions of dollars into OpenAI competitor Anthropic since 2023.The details of Amazon's talks with OpenAI are still fluid and the final total is subject to change, but the term sheet could be signed in the coming weeks, the person said. A representative for Amazon declined to comment. The Wall Street Journal was the first to report the $50 billion figure. OpenAI is also engaging in fundraising discussions with other investors, and the total round could close at around $100 billion, the person said. Altman was in the United Arab Emirates to participate in investment talks with sovereign wealth funds last week, as CNBC previously reported. The startup's funding round could close in two parts, beginning with investments from strategics like Amazon, Microsoft and Nvidia, the person said. Other contributions from participants like SoftBank, which is in talks to invest up to $30 billion in OpenAI, would follow, the source said.Read more CNBC tech newsA Waymo hit a child near an elementary school.

OpenAI has grown into one of the largest commercial entities on the planet, and its valuation swelled to $500 billion in October after it finalized a secondary share sale. Amazon and OpenAI have been in talks about a potential investment since last year, and the final deal could include an agreement to use Amazon's AI chips, as CNBC previously reported.  Anthropic was founded by a group of former OpenAI executives and researchers, including CEO Dario Amodei, in 2021. The company is best known for its family of AI models called Claude, and it closed a multibillion-dollar funding round at a $350 billion valuation earlier this month.Amazon Web Services was named Anthropic's primary cloud provider in 2023 and its primary training partner in 2024. It continues to serve in both of those roles. Amazon has been cutting costs across its business to invest more in AI and the rapid build-out of data centers. On Wednesday, Amazon announced it would cut about 16,000 corporate employees, marking its second round of mass job cuts since last October.Last October, Amazon opened an $11 billion data center campus for Anthropic in Indiana, called Project Rainier. Amazon said that same month that it expects capital expenditures to reach $125 billion for 2026, the highest spending forecast among the megacap companies at the time.WATCH: OpenAI stock will perform ‘terrific’ when it goes public, says Altimeter CEO Brad Gerstnerwatch now",

    "body": "US President Donald Trump greets Britain's Prime Minister Keir Starmer during a summit on Gaza, Egypt, in Sharm el-Sheikh on Oct. 13, 2025. Evan Vucci | Afp | Getty ImagesU.S. President Donald Trump on Thursday reportedly warned the U.K. that it would be \"very dangerous\" for the country to do business with China, after London and Beijing announced steps aimed at mending ties. After years of strained relations, China and the U.K. are looking to develop a long-term strategic partnership following a high-stakes meeting between Chinese President Xi Jinping and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer.Starmer is on a 4-day visit to China, the first trip by a British prime minister in eight years, signaling an attempt at resetting bilateral ties.On the sidelines of premiere of the \"Melania\" film at the Kennedy Center, Trump was asked to comment on Starmer's efforts to get into business with China, and he said that \"it's very dangerous for them to do that,\" Reuters reported. China on Thursday agreed to halve its import tariffs on British whisky to 5% from 10% and confirmed visa-free travels for British nationals visiting China for under 30 days, according to Downing Street. Meanwhile, British drugmaker AstraZeneca will invest $15 billion in China through 2030 to expand medicines manufacturing and research and development in the country. Starmer has brought a delegation of nearly 60 British business executives and organization leaders on this trip. He hailed the agreements on visa-free travel and lowering whisky tariffs as \"really important access, symbolic of what we're doing with the relationship. U.K.'s diplomatic shift appears to mirror that of Canada which signed a trade agreement with China earlier this month following a visit by Prime Minister Mark Carney, as Ottawa appears to diversify trade and investment partners amid persistent frictions with Washington. On Canada, Trump said that \"it's even more dangerous for Canada to get into business with China. Canada is not doing well ... You can't look at China as the answer,\" Reuters reported. \"President Xi is a friend of mine, I know him very well ... The first thing they're going to do is say you're not allowed to play ice hockey anymore. Canada's not going to like that,\" Trump said. Trump has threatened to impose a 100% tariff on Canadian goods if Ottawa moved forward with a trade deal with China, in a sharp reversal from his previous comments that such a deal could be \"a good thing.\" watch nowBefore his trip to Beijing, Starmer said in an interview with Bloomberg that Britain would not have to choose between the U.S. and China, saying that the country can continue to strengthen economic ties with Beijing without angering Trump or harming relations with the U.S.  \"We've got very close relations with the US — of course, we want to — and we will maintain that business, alongside security and defense,\" he said. \"Starmer is wary of alienating Washington. But the U.K.'s squeezed position between the two superpowers is structural, not a quirk of the Trump administration,\" said Gabriel Wildau, managing director at political consultancy Teoneo. Optionality, rather than a full resetWildau suggested a broad U.K.-China trade deal is unlikely as Starmer is pursuing a \"re-balancing\" of the country's foreign relations, rather than a structural reset with China that may attract \"unwanted attention\" from Western allies.  The same diplomatic posturing applies to other \"middle power\" leaders who have visited China in recent months, he added. watch nowA flurry of Western leaders, unsettled by Trump's unpredictable foreign policy and \"America First\" agenda, have been weighing closer ties with Beijing — even at the risk of provoking Trump.Since November, Beijing has hosted French President Emmanual Macron, South Korean President Lee Jae Myung, Finnish Prime Minister Petteri Orpo, German Finance Minister Lars Klingbeil and Irish Taoiseach Micheal Martin — the first visit by an Irish leader in 14 years. \"Rather than realignment, these governments are seeking optionality by creating issue-specific coalitions with China and each other to reduce dependence on the U.S.,\" Wildau noted.

That inmate is Luigi Mangione, according to a person in law enforcement, who asked not to be named because they were not authorized to speak publicly on the matter.Mangione is accused of murdering UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson on a midtown Manhattan street in December 2024.The Minnesota man, 36-year-old Mark Anderson of Mankato, when asked by Bureau of Prisons personnel at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn for his credentials, produced a Minnesota driver's license, prosecutors said. Mangione is being held at that jail without bail.Anderson also allegedly said he had weapons in a bag he was carrying. Inside the bag was a barbecue fork and a circular steel blade that resembled a pizza cutter, according to the criminal complaint filed by the U.S. Attorney's Office in Brooklyn.\"Anderson also displayed and threw at the BOP officers numerous documents,\" an FBI agent who signed the complaint wrote. \"I have reviewed those papers and they appear to be related to filing of claims against the United States Department of Justice,\" the agent wrote.A barbecue fork, driver's license and circular steel blade allegedly found in the possession of Mark Anderson of Mankato, Minnesota, when he was detained after allegedly posing as an FBI agent at the Metropolitan Detention Center in New York on Jan. 28, 2026.U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New YorkAnderson is being charged with impersonating an FBI agent and is scheduled to appear Thursday afternoon in Brooklyn federal court, where he is charged in a complaint.The complaint does not identify by name the inmate that Anderson allegedly hoped to free.

    "body": "Apple CEO Tim Cook holds up a new iPhone 17 Pro during an Apple special event at Apple headquarters in Cupertino, California, Sept. 9, 2025.Justin Sullivan | Getty ImagesApple reported blowout first-quarter earnings on Thursday, and predicted growth of as much as 16% in the current quarter, matching the period that just ended. Sales could be even better, Apple said, if the company could secure enough chips to meet its customers' iPhone demands.\"We expect our March quarter total company revenue to grow by 13% to 16% year over year, which comprehends our best estimates of constrained iPhone supply during the quarter,\" finance chief Kevan Parekh told analysts on Thursday.On the company's earnings call, analysts asked CEO Tim Cook several questions about Apple's access to memory components, which have seen their prices skyrocket due to demand related to chips necessary for artificial intelligence data centers. That has caused a memory shortage. Instead of dwelling on memory, Cook focused on rising demand and the company's lean inventory. He said that what's keeping Apple from making more iPhones is access to advanced node manufacturing for its A-series and M-series chips, which the company calls SoCs, or a system-on-chip.Apple manufactures its advanced node chips with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., which dominates the market for leading node manufacturing. Apple said on Thursday that it was seeking manufacturing on the company's 3-nanometer node. \"The constraints that we have are driven by the availability of the advanced nodes that our SoCs are produced on, and at this time, we're seeing less flexibility in supply chain than normal, partly because of our increased demand,\" Cook said. Cook said Apple is in the process of increasing its access to supply and didn't want to forecast beyond March.Although this quarter's supply shortage is related to advanced node chip manufacturing, Cook acknowledged that Apple would be affected by rising memory prices, and that the company was looking at \"a range of options\" for what it could do. But he declined to talk about the specifics of how Apple is grappling with the AI-driven shortage that is affecting nearly every device maker in the world. \"As always, we'll look at a range of options to deal with that,\" Cook said. Apple said it expects gross margins to be between 48% and 49% in the March quarter, which at the midpoint would be a larger gross margin than in the December quarter. Cook said that rising memory prices had a \"minimal impact\" on Apple in the December quarter but would have a bigger effect in the March quarter. Last year, Apple announced it would spend over $600 billion in the U.S. over five years, with a big chunk of that going toward a handful of companies who have committed to build chips in America, including TSMC, which has historically done most of its manufacturing in Taiwan. On Thursday, Cook said Apple had sourced 20 billion chips from the U.S. in 2025, higher than the company's previous target of 19 billion U.S. chips.

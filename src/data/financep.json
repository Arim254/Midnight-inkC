    "body": "Americans have racked up a collective $1.23 trillion in credit card debt as of the third quarter of 2025, according to New York Fed data.Some households are turning to credit cards and buy now, pay later loans to cover their everyday essentials as the costs of basic necessities, including rent, groceries and utilities, have risen in recent years. But others are simply spending beyond their means. Nearly 30% of Americans reported overspending on luxuries and comforts, a 2023 survey from financial services company Empower found.When individuals try to rein in their impulsive spending, they often go to one of two extremes: chaos or rigidity, Jaelyn Vickery, a certified financial therapist who specializes in the psychology of consumption, tells CNBC Make It. Between the two extremes, \"Adaptability is what is most important,\" to develop healthy spending habits, she says.Chaos can look like saying, \"Well, I already messed up, so I might as well just go all the way off the deep end,\" and continue to overspend, she says. Rigidity, on the other hand, may look like enforcing a strict budget that doesn't allow you to enjoy any discretionary spending.\"A lot of the overwhelm and poor mental health [that] happens is when people just bounce between either end of that spectrum,\" Vickery says. \"What lies in the middle of that is adaptability, because we need both rigidity and chaos,\" she adds. \"We need to be able to flow between the two to really find that balance in regards to our consumption.\"How adaptability can help stop overspendingIt may seem like getting rigid with your budget is a smart way to curb overspending. But Vickery, along with other financial experts, advises against a restrictive budget because it's unlikely you'll actually stick to it and could wind up swinging right back into overspending as a result.The goal is not to try to be perfectly \"balanced\" all the time because \"perfection is not something that's healthy to try and sustain forever,\" she adds. But the self-awareness to know when you're feeling yourself move to either side of the scale is key to better overall spending management.\"Self-awareness is your superpower,\" Vickery says. \"If we can be more self aware of what triggers certain behaviors of overconsumption or under consumption, we can bounce back that much quicker.\" Feelings like anxiety, depression and overwhelm can make an individual fall onto either of the extreme sides of the spending scale because it's something we can control versus events in your life outside of your control than can cause those feelings in the first place, Vickery says.\"When we are seeking to control the behavior without actually addressing the underlying need or suppressed emotion, it causes a cycle to continue,\" she says.Once you're able to identify your triggers and how you react to them, you can work toward refining the cycle to fit your lifestyle, Vickery says. \"Re-route the consumption toward something that aligns with the person's current intention or goal,\" she says.Say you tend to shop as a response to boredom, anxiety or stress. Try redirecting that energy toward an \"alternative form of consumption that actually supports [your] intention in the moment,\" Vickery says. That could be stepping away from your phone or laptop, trying breathing or movement exercises, or using another sensory reset method, such as the 5-4-3-2-1 method, in which you name five things you can see, four you can hear, three you can feel, two you can smell and one you can taste.If you're struggling with overspending, it may also be smart to talk to a trusted financial or mental health professional.Want to give your kids the ultimate advantage? Sign up for CNBC's new online course, How to Raise Financially Smart Kids.

The change takes effect after the market close on April 8, resetting a fund launched in 2008 that has just $23 million in assets. Alongside the new name, the ETF will adopt a revamped benchmark index and a broad investment mandate meant to capture what VanEck calls the emerging \"Degen Economy.\"\"Degen,\" short for \"degenerate,\" originated in gambling circles and later migrated into crypto and retail-trading communities as a tongue-in-cheek label for people making high-risk, often impulsive bets.The original gaming ETF targeted casinos, sports betting, lottery services and gaming players. Now the Degen ETF is expanding into companies earning at least 50% of revenue from \"Millennial Finance\" and \"Gig Economy and Online Forums.\"\"Millennial Finance\" includes digital brokerages, neobanks, crypto exchanges and BNPL or buy now, pay later providers. \"Gig Economy and Online Forums\" targets ride-hailing, delivery apps, freelance marketplaces and community platforms.The VanEck Gaming ETF is up only about 3% this year, significantly trailing the S&P 500.",

    "body": "President Donald Trump speaks during a roundtable discussion in the Roosevelt Room of the White House, Dec. 10, 2025.Andrew Caballero-Reynolds | AFP | Getty ImagesU.S. forces on Wednesday seized an oil tanker off the coast of Venezuela, President Donald Trump said. \"We've just seized a tanker on the coast of Venezuela — a large tanker, very large, the largest one ever seized actually,\" Trump said during a meeting in the Roosevelt Room at the White House.The president declined to provide information on who owned the tanker or its destination, but said it was \"seized for a very good reason.\"The tanker has been identified as the Skipper, according to Matt Smith, head U.S. analyst at energy consulting firm Kpler.Skipper is a Guyana-flagged \"Very Large Crude Carrier,\" or VLCC, that was loaded covertly with 1.1 million barrels of oil in mid-November, Smith told CNBC.Smith said the ship appeared to be headed for Cuba, though it has been stopped offshore Venezuela since it was loaded.Attorney General Pam Bondi said later Wednesday that a seizure warrant for the crude oil tanker was executed by the FBI, the Homeland Security Department's investigations unit and the U.S. Coast Guard, with support from the Pentagon.Bondi, in an X post, shared apparent military drone footage showing soldiers boarding the vessel from a helicopter.The tanker, which transported oil from Venezuela and Iran, has been sanctioned by the U.S. for years \"due to its involvement in an illicit oil shipping network supporting foreign terrorist organizations,\" Bondi wrote on X.The seizure \"was conducted safely and securely,\" she added, \"and our investigation alongside the Department of Homeland Security to prevent the transport of sanctioned oil continues.\"U.S. crude oil was up 70 cents, or 1.2%, to $58.95 per barrel at 3:12 p.m. ET. Global benchmark Brent rose 71 cents, or 1.15%, to $62.65 a barrel. Trump has escalated pressure on Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro in recent weeks. The president said Maduro's \"days are numbered\" in an interview with Politico published Tuesday. He would not rule out a ground invasion of the South American nation.\"I don't want to rule in or out. I don't talk about it,\" Trump told Politico. The White House has undertaken a large military buildup in the Caribbean and launched controversial, deadly strikes against boats that it claims were trafficking drugs to the U.S. Venezuela is a founding member of OPEC and has the largest proven oil reserves in the world. It is exporting about 749,000 barrels per day this year with at least half that oil going to China, according to data from Kpler.Venezuela exports about 132,000 bpd to the U.S., according to Kpler. \"Shippers will likely be much more cautious and hesitant about loading Venezuelan crude going forward,\" Smith said. — CNBC's Lori Ann LaRocco contributed to this report.",

Also in the running were several showcasing Ruby Bridges, the first Black student to integrate her school.Instead, the Mint's five finalized designs for the 25-cent coin spotlight:Pilgrims and the MayflowerGeorge Washington and the Revolutionary WarThomas Jefferson and the Liberty BellJames Madison and Independence HallAbraham Lincoln and a quote from the Gettysburg AddressActing Mint Director Kristie McNally said in a press release that the selected designs \"depict the story of America's journey toward a 'more perfect union,' and celebrate America's defining ideals of liberty.\"\"We hope to offer each American the opportunity to hold our nation's storied 250 years of history in the palms of their hands,\" McNally said.Wednesday's unveiling follows several splashy moves around U.S. coinage in recent months.The U.S. Mint produced its last-ever penny in November after making them for more than 230 years, citing increasing production costs and a decline in physical cash usage amid the rise in electronic payment options.U.S. Treasurer Brandon Beach confirmed in October that the Treasury Department was considering minting a $1 coin featuring President Donald Trump on both sides for the 250th anniversary. The back of the coin would showcase imagery similar to those captured of Trump after the assassination attempt against him last year.A Treasury spokesperson told CNBC in October that a final design for a $1 coin had not yet be chosen. As of Thursday, the Mint's list of contenders included three designs for the \"heads\" side all featuring Trump.",

    "body": "watch nowOracle shares plummeted 15% Thursday, after the firm reported disappointing results.The cloud computing and database software maker reported lower-than-expected quarterly revenue on Wednesday, despite booming demand for its artificial intelligence infrastructure. Its revenue came in at $16.06 billion, compared with $16.21 billion expected by analysts, according to data compiled by LSEG.It dragged other AI-related names down with it. Chip darling Nvidia fell more than 2%, memory and storage firm Micron was 1% lower, cloud company Coreweave slid 5% and AMD was 3% lower. Oracle has been the subject of much market chatter since raising $18 billion in a jumbo bond sale in September, marking one of the largest debt issuances for the tech industry on record. The name shot onto investor agendas when it inked a $300 billion deal with OpenAI in the same month. Oracle made further moves into cloud infrastructure, where it battles Big Tech names such as Amazon,  Microsoft and Google for AI contracts.However, investors have questioned Oracle's aggressive AI infrastructure build-out plans and whether it needs such a colossal amount of debt to execute, though other tech firms have also recently issued corporate bonds.

The firm will raise roughly $20 billion to $30 billion in debt every year for the next three years, according to estimates by Citi analyst Tyler Radke.On the company's earnings call, Principal Financial Officer Doug Kehring committed to keeping Oracle's investment-grade debt rating. \"In addition, there are other financing options through customers that may bring their own chips to be installed in our data centers and suppliers who may lease their chips rather than sell them,\" he said. \"Both of these options enable Oracle to synchronize our payments with our receipts and borrow substantially less than most people are modeling.\"Oracle expects about $50 billion in full-year capital expenditures, up from $35 billion as of September, with the new commitments, Kehring said. The sum for fiscal 2025 was $21.2 billion.Its free cash flow — the metric investors are watching closely as they navigate AI bubble concerns, as it shows a company's ability to pay its debt —  for the November quarter was negative by about $10 billion. The StreetAccount consensus was negative $5.2 billion.While this is \"naturally a focus point of investors,\" Wedbush Securities analysts said that it's \"a high class problem that Oracle is dealing with on the AI demand front.\"\"Overall, Oracle's core AI and cloud numbers and backlog tell a very healthy and robust AI Revolution demand story for the sector....any sell-off today on the sector we view as a clear buying opportunity given the underlying demand story that was further validated by Oracle last night.\"Oracle's share price has moved 34% higher year-to-date despite recent losses. — CNBC's Seema Mody and Jordan Novet contributed to this report.",

Bansal's latest venture, Harness, is now worth substantially more than that, after raking in $200 million in fresh capital at a $5.5 billion valuation in a funding round led by Goldman Sachs.Harness' technology helps companies manage and monitor code that's produced with the help of artificial intelligence, making sure it doesn't break, create security vulnerabilities or trigger cost overruns. It's a compliment to the so-called vibe coding trend that's taken off with the boom in generative AI. In recent months, venture capitalists have poured money into startups such as Cursor, Lovable and most recently Kilo Code that sell subscriptions for tools for directing AI models to write and update software. Harness' software draws on models from Anthropic and OpenAI.Earlier this year, Bansal bolstered Harness' cybersecurity chops by merging the startup with Traceable, another company he co-founded. The combined company, based in San Francisco, has a total of about 1,300 employees.Harness is on track to exceed its goal of more than $250 million in annualized revenue, growing more than 50% year over year, Bansal said. That makes it larger than AppDynamics at the time it was acquired by Cisco. Bansal is aiming for a different outcome this time. \"I'm a believer that at the right market timing, we want to operate as a public company, so we can build for the long term,\" Bansal said. In addition to the funding round, Harness is also planning a $40 million tender offer to provide some liquidity to long-standing employees.WATCH: 'Vibe-coding's' evil twin?

    "body": "watch nowPresident Donald Trump is willing to seize more oil tankers off the coast of Venezuela, a White House official told CNBC on Thursday. The U.S. seized a tanker on Wednesday that had allegedly transported oil from Venezuela to Iran. The action comes as Trump escalates pressure on President Nicolas Maduro. The White House official told CNBC that the Trump administration is always looking to enforce the law. The oil market has been focused on Ukraine peace talks and so far is not indicating a risk of a major supply disruption. U.S. crude oil was last down $1.04, or 1.78%, to $57.42 a barrel. Global benchmark Brent was at $61.11, down $1.10, or 1.77%. Sources told Reuters earlier that U.S. is expected to target more ships transporting Venezuelan crude in the coming weeks. The Treasury Department updated its Venezuela sanctions list on Thursday to include more than a dozen additional people, companies and tankers. The tanker seized on Wednesday was a \"Very Large Crude Carrier,\" or VLCC, identified as the Skipper, Matt Smith, head U.S. analyst at energy consulting firm Kpler, told CNBC. It was loaded covertly with 1.1 million barrels in mid-November and appeared on course for Cuba, Smith said. The tanker will be taken to a U.S. port and the oil will be seized, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters on Thursday. \"However, there is a legal process for the seizure of that oil and that legal process will be followed,\" Leavitt said. The tanker seizure comes amid a major U.S. military buildup in the Caribbean. The Trump administration has launched a series of deadly strikes in recent months on boats that it says were trafficking drugs to the U.S. Those strikes have been the subject of intense scrutiny in Congress over their legality. Venezuela is a founding member of OPEC and has the largest proven oil reserves in the world.  It is exporting about 749,000 barrels per day this year with at least half that oil going to China, according to data from Kpler.",

    "body": "The Eli Lilly logo appears on the company’s office in San Diego, California, U.S., Nov. 21, 2025.Mike Blake | ReutersEli Lilly on Thursday said its next-generation obesity drug delivered what appears to be the highest weight loss yet in a late-stage trial while reducing knee arthritis pain, clearing the first of several upcoming studies on the weekly injection. The highest dose of the drug helped patients with obesity and a type of knee arthritis lose an average of 23.7% of their body weight at 68 weeks, when analyzing all participants, including those who discontinued treatment. When evaluating only patients who stayed on the drug, the highest dose delivered 28.7% weight loss on average. The company said some patients lost so much weight that they decided to drop out of the trial. \"It's incredible,\" said Dr. Caroline Apovian, co-director of the Center for Weight Management and Wellness at Brigham and Women's Hospital. \"Now, we have a drug that rivals the weight loss benefits of surgery.\"Apovian said Eli Lilly appears to be positioning the drug strategically for people with severe obesity, or a body mass index above 35 or 40. She noted that the company said 84% of patients in the trial had a BMI above that number in the trial.Shares of Eli Lilly rose more than 3% on Thursday. It is the first late-stage data on retatrutide, which works differently from existing injections and appears to be more effective. Eli Lilly is betting big on retatrutide as the next pillar of its obesity portfolio after its weight loss injection Zepbound and its upcoming pill. But it's still unclear when the drug could enter the market. It's a critical part of the drugmaker's plan to maintain its market share majority over Novo Nordisk in the booming market for weight loss and diabetes drugs. Some analysts estimate the segment could be worth about $100 billion by the 2030s.Retatrutide also met the trial's other main goal of reducing pain from knee osteoarthritis – a common condition that wears down the joint's cartilage and leads to pain and stiffness – by up to 62.6% on average when analyzing all patients, based on a widely used survey. More than 1 in 8 patients who took the drug were completely free from knee pain by the end of the trial, Eli Lilly said. One concern with current weight loss drugs is that they can lead to the loss of lean muscle mass. But Apovian said the results show that in adults with severe obesity, you can improve physical function with retatrutide. The results appear to surpass Wall Street's expectations. In a note ahead of the findings, BMO Capital Markets analyst Evan Seigerman said his base-case assumption was for the drug to show weight loss of around 20% to 23%, with at least a 50% reduction in knee pain. The company believes retatrutide \"could become an important option for patients with significant weight loss needs and certain complications, including knee osteoarthritis,\" Kenneth Custer, president of Lilly Cardiometabolic Health, said in a statement. In a note Thursday, JPMorgan analyst Chris Schott said retatrutide's tolerability data, or how well patients handle the treatment, is \"somewhat worse vs Zepbound, though not surprising, in our view.\" Roughly 18% of patients on the highest dose of the drug stopped treatment due to side effects, compared with 4% of those in the placebo group. Eli Lilly said those dropout rates were \"highly correlated\" to patients' starting body mass index and included discontinuations due to \"perceived excessive weight loss.\" Among those with a BMI of 35 or higher who took highest dose, 12% stopped treatment. Schott said that number is closer to the dropout rates seen in trials on Eli Lilly's weight loss drug Zepbound and Novo Nordisk's obesity injection Wegovy. In a separate note on Thursday, BMO's Seigerman said discontinuation rates \"appear to highlight the speed and strength of weight loss was excessive for some patients with lower BMI.\" But he said, \"all in results are impressive.\"Around 43% of patients on the highest dose experienced nausea, while roughly 33% and 20.9% had diarrhea and vomiting, respectively. More than 1 in 5 patients on the highest dose also experienced dysesthesia, which is an unpleasant nerve sensation. The company said it was generally mild for patients and rarely led to them discontinuing treatment. The study, called TRIUMPH-4, didn't solely focus on weight loss, meaning that other trials specifically designed for that outcome could produce different or higher results. Eli Lilly expects to report findings from seven additional phase three trials on the drug by the end of 2026. More CNBC health coverageThe Trump administration is changing Covid, childhood vaccine recommendations – here's what it means for youU.S. to impose 100% tariff on branded, patented drugs unless firms build plants locally, Trump saysEli Lilly to build $6.5 billion Texas manufacturing facility for obesity pill, other drugsDubbed the \"triple G\" drug, retatrutide works by mimicking three hunger-regulating hormones – GLP-1, GIP and glucagon – rather than just one or two like existing treatments. That appears to have more potent effects on a person's appetite and satisfaction with food than other treatments.Tirzepatide, the active ingredient in Zepbound, mimics GLP-1 and GIP. Novo Nordisk's semaglutide, the active ingredient in Wegovy, mimics only GLP-1.Higher doses of tirzepatide helped patients with obesity lose roughly 20.9% of their body weight on average in late-stage studies, when analyzing all patients regardless of discontinuations. As Eli Lilly establishes an edge in the space, its chief rival, Novo Nordisk, is racing to catch up. In March, Novo Nordisk said it agreed to pay up to $2 billion for the rights to an early experimental drug from the Chinese pharmaceutical company United Laboratories International. Novo Nordisk's newly acquired drug is a clear potential competitor to retatrutide because it similarly uses a three-pronged approach to promoting weight loss and regulating blood sugar. But Novo Nordisk's treatment is much earlier in development, meaning it will take several years before it reaches patients. ",

    "body": "A home is shown for sale in The Heights in Houston, Monday, Oct. 27, 2025.Kirk Sides | Houston Chronicle | Getty ImagesHome prices have finally come down compared with last year, though just fractionally, according to daily reads from Parcl Labs, which looks at high-frequency listing data on single-family homes, condos and townhomes, both new and existing. They may stay softer, though, as home prices are down 1.4% in just the last three months.On a national level, home prices have not gone negative since mid-2023, a year after the Federal Reserve first brought rates up from zero, and mortgage rates moved sharply higher. From March 2022 to June 2023, the average rate on the popular 30-year fixed mortgage went from 3.9% to just over 7%, according to Mortgage News Daily. But even then, prices were negative on a year-over-year basis for just a few months. It was nothing like the great financial crisis when home prices dropped 27% from their peak in 2006 to their trough in 2012, according to the S&P Case-Shiller National Home Price Index. \"More recently we have seen a period of national softness emerging after the rapid run-up during the Covid years, 2020 to 2022,\" said Jason Lewris, co-founder of Parcl Labs. \"The sharp increase in mortgage rates in 2022 and 2023 created an affordability shock: buyers were priced out, sales volumes dropped, and sellers had to adjust expectations. Historically, that combination of a credit or affordability shock, weaker demand, and more inventory than the market can easily absorb is what tends to produce broad national price declines.\"Inventory today is still historically low, but it has come off its near-record lows of recent years. Active listings in November were nearly 13% higher than November 2024, but new listings were just 1.7% higher, according to Realtor.com. Sellers are also pulling their homes off the market at an unusually high rate. Prices nationally are down less than 1%, but certain markets are seeing more significant drops: Prices in Austin, Texas, are down 10% from last year; in Denver, they're down 5%, according to Parcl Labs. Tampa, Florida, and Houston both saw prices fall 4%, and Atlanta and Phoenix saw price decreases of 3%.There are also markets seeing gains: in Cleveland, prices gained 6%; Chicago and New York City both saw price increases of 5%; Philadelphia saw prices rise 3%; and Pittsburgh and Boston both saw 2% price gains, according to Parcl.

There has been no government data on housing starts, building permits or sales of newly built homes since before the government shutdown started, so it's difficult to paint any kind of supply picture in the price forecast. That said, builders reporting quarterly earnings have indicated that demand is still relatively weak and incentives are still necessary. Homebuilder sentiment is still well into negative territory.\"We continue to see demand-side weakness as a softening labor market and stretched consumer finances are contributing to a difficult sales environment,\" said Robert Dietz, NAHB's chief economist, in a November release. \"After a decline for single-family housing starts in 2025, NAHB is forecasting a slight gain in 2026 as builders continue to report future sales conditions in marginally positive territory.\" Mortgage rates have not moved much in the last three months, and had very little reaction to the latest Federal Reserve rate cut Wednesday. Home prices, therefore, are unlikely to do much either. \"Our base case from here is not a deep national downturn, but a period where prices hover around zero, with small positive or small negative year over year changes, rather than the double digit gains of the pandemic era,\" said Lewris. \"How far they move in either direction will depend mainly on mortgage rates and the broader health of the economy.\" ",

Giorgio Viera | AFP | Getty ImagesElon Musk responded to the latest report that SpaceX is going public in 2026, calling it \"accurate.\"The article from Ars Technica's Eric Berger examined why this is the right time for Musk's space venture to IPO, and said the rise of artificial intelligence and opportunities for data centers in space play an important role in the move.\"As usual, Eric is accurate,\" Musk wrote on his social media platform X in response to Berger's article.Musk's comment comes after multiple news outlets said that SpaceX was looking to go public in 2026, with The Information and Wall Street Journal both reporting on the likeliness of an IPO last week, as well as a new share sale valuing the company at about $800 billion. Bloomberg said this week that the company was pursuing an IPO in 2026 and is looking to raise more than $30 billion.Over the weekend, Musk said on X that reports of the $800 billion valuation were \"not accurate\" and addressed the amount his company gets from NASA.\"While I have great fondness for @NASA, they will constitute less than 5% of our revenue next year,\" Musk wrote. \"Commercial Starlink is by far our largest contributor to revenue. Some people have claimed that SpaceX gets 'subsidized' by NASA. This is absolutely false.\"SpaceX didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.Heading into 2026, SpaceX and Tesla CEO Musk look set to gain a powerful ally in the government's space program.Read more CNBC tech newsOracle shares plummet, dragging down AI stocksOver $50 billion in under 24 hours: Why Big Tech is doubling down on investing in IndiaCisco's stock closes at record for first time since dot-com peak in 2000Nvidia-backed Starcloud trains first AI model in space as orbital data center race heats upJared Isaacman, who paid millions to lead two private spaceflights with SpaceX in 2021 and 2024, is likely to become the next NASA administrator and was voted through committee on Monday.He now heads to a full Senate vote for confirmation.SpaceX is a key contractor for NASA, but acting administrator Sean Duffy has criticized Musk's space operation for being behind on the Artemis moon trip, which has seen several delays.Musk lashed out at Duffy, accusing him on X of \"trying to kill NASA!\"Duffy, who is the secretary of transportation, was handed the reins of the space program this summer by President Donald Trump, after he pulled Isaacman's nomination following a clash with Musk.Trump said at the time that Isaacman's relationship with Musk represented a conflict of interest.The re-nomination of Isaacman at the beginning of November signaled that the relationship between Trump and Musk was on the mend, and the Tesla CEO's attendance at a White House dinner later that month solidified the return to camaraderie.— CNBC's Lora Kolodny contributed to this report.WATCH: How SpaceX is fueling Elon Musk's wealth surgewatch now",

    "body": "watch nowThe Walt Disney Company's $1 billion equity investment in OpenAI will serve as \"a way in\" to artificial intelligence, which will have a significant long-term impact on Disney's business, Disney CEO Bob Iger told CNBC's \"Squawk on the Street\" on Thursday.\"We want to participate in what Sam is creating, what his team is creating,\" Iger said. \"We think this is a good investment for the company.\"Disney announced its investment in OpenAI as part of an agreement on Thursday that will allow users to make AI videos with its copyrighted characters on the startup's app called Sora. More than 200 characters, including Mickey Mouse, Darth Vader and Cinderella, will be available on the platform through a three-year licensing agreement, which Iger said would be exclusive to OpenAI at the beginning of the term.As new AI products have exploded into the mainstream, several media companies, including Disney, have taken legal action in an effort to safeguard their intellectual property. Iger said Disney has been \"aggressive\" at protecting its IP, but he has been \"extremely impressed\" with OpenAI's growth as well as their willingness to license content. \"No human generation has ever stood in the way of technological advance, and we don't intend to try,\" Iger said. \"We've always felt that if it's going to happen, including disruption of our current business models, then we should get on board.\"Shares of Disney are up more than 1% on Thursday.Read more CNBC tech newsOracle shares plummet, dragging down AI stocksOver $50 billion in under 24 hours: Why Big Tech is doubling down on investing in IndiaCisco's stock closes at record for first time since dot-com peak in 2000Nvidia-backed Starcloud trains first AI model in space as orbital data center race heats upBarton Crockett, a senior internet media research analyst, told CNBC that Disney's investment is \"a great endorsement for OpenAI.\" He said it's important for companies like Disney to understand the importance of user-generated and AI-generated content.\"I think it's crucial for a content-creation company, like Disney, to get ahead of that,\" he said.OpenAI launched Sora in September, and the short-form video app allows people to generate content by simply typing in a prompt. The app quickly rose to the top of Apple's App Store, but as users flooded the platform with videos of popular brands and characters, large media players began to raise concerns around safety and copyright infringement. Iger said Disney's deal with OpenAI \"does not in any way represent a threat to creators at all,\" in part because characters' voices as well as talent names and likenesses are not included. \"In fact, the opposite,\" Iger said. \"I think it honors them and respects them, in part because there's a license fee associated with it.\"OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said there will be guardrails in place around how Disney's characters will be used on Sora.  \"It's very important that we enable Disney to set and evolve those guardrails over time, but they will of course be in there,\" Altman told CNBC on Thursday.WATCH: Watch CNBC’s full interview with Disney CEO Bob Iger and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman",

The Motion Picture Association said in October that OpenAI needed to take \"immediate and decisive action\" to prevent copyright infringement on Sora. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said more \"granular control\" over character generation was coming, according to a blog post following the launch.Disney CEO Bob Iger and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman appearing on CNBC on Dec. 11th, 2025.CNBCAs AI startups have rapidly changed the way that people can interact with content online, media companies, including Disney, have kicked off a series of fresh legal battles to try and protect their intellectual property.Disney sent a cease and desist letter to Google late on Wednesday alleging the company infringed its copyrights on a \"massive scale.\" In the letter, which was viewed by CNBC, Disney said Google has been using its copyrighted works to train models and distributing copies of its protected content without authorization.CNBC has reached out to Google for comment on the letter.Universal and Disney have sued the AI image creator Midjourney, alleging that the company improperly used and distributed AI-generated characters from their movies.

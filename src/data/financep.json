    "body": "I spent the last three years of my life researching money and wealth.During that time, I developed and battle-tested my own set of money principles, mindsets, tips, guardrails, and tools that helped me build a life that feels truly abundant.Here are 25 money rules I'm following to live a wealthy life.1. Avoid errorsYou can get pretty damn far by just avoiding errors: silly impulse purchases, avoidable debt, emotional investing, neglected responsibilities. Slow down, think clearly, and protect yourself from…yourself. 2. Never allow self-worth to be dictated by net worthMarkets fluctuate. Seasons change. Businesses rise and fall. Your sense of worth must be anchored in something deeper: character, values, relationships, interests, service.3. Track progress You can't improve what you don't track. Use a financial tracking and management tool to get a clear picture.4. Live below your meansManage financial expectations by keeping your lifestyle well below your means, creating slack in the system, and never matching an economic leap forward with a lifestyle one.5. Focus on value, impact, and serviceThe people who do the best financially are usually the ones who obsess over solving real problems, creating real impact, or genuinely helping others. 6. Treat income as the leverage pointThe return on improving your skills, expanding your scope, building new earning streams, or stepping into higher-impact roles dwarfs the difference between a 6% or 8% market return.7. Spend more for quality, not for brandWhen purchasing products for their utility, always invest a bit more and opt for quality. They'll last longer and create fewer headaches. 8. Ignore external expectationsThe world is full of silent scripts about what you should buy, achieve, or own by certain ages. Most of them are complete nonsense. Your life is not a race with anyone else. There are no timelines. You get to create your own.9. Debt is a tool, but use it sparinglyNever use debt to live a life you can't truly afford. A simple rule I follow: Never finance a luxury material purchase if you can't buy it twice over in cash. 10. Follow a 24-hour rule for non-essential purchases above a certain thresholdThis reduces impulse purchases and improves saving and investing rates. If you still want to buy the thing after 24 hours, go for it.11. Consider time and moneyThere are some investments that require money and no time (index funds) and some that require money and a lot of time (active multi-family real estate). Make sure you consider both when evaluating returns on an opportunity.12. Remember that returns come in many formsEarly in my career, I started making angel investments in early stage technology companies. On paper, it didn't make a lot of sense: I didn't have much excess capital and I knew that most of the startups would fail. But what they lacked in financial returns, they made up for in access, networks, and learning.13. Never think twice about investments in yourselfThere are a lot of things that look like expenses but are better regarded as investments in yourself: fitness, quality food, books, personal development, mental health, etc. You'll have more energy, feel better, and show up better in the world.14. Never use money to optimize the life out of your lifeWhen you start making more money, an entire menu of options materializes to reduce life's minor frictions. You can hire a personal chef, a full-time cleaner, a staff, or a driver. But sometimes that friction was what created meaning. Cherish the meaningful friction in your life.15. Check in with your partnerMoney trouble rarely comes from math. It comes from misalignment. A monthly financial check-in creates transparency, trust, and shared direction. Focus on values. What matters this month? What doesn't? 16. Focus on expanding your savings rateEven small percentage increases have an outsized long-term impact when you consider the magic of compounding.17. Work toward a 12-month emergency fundIt may seem excessive, but there's value in peace of mind. Knowing you have that financial security allows you to see and capitalize on exciting opportunities when they come. 18. Run quarterly disaster simulationsYour willingness to imagine bad times during good times is what allows you to safely navigate them. What if you lost your job? What if you had a major healthcare expense? 19. Don't waste energy Bestselling financial author Ramit Sethi says people ask $3 questions (can I buy this coffee?) when what truly matters are $30,000 questions (how can I earn twice as much?). I see friends spending countless hours thinking about optimizing credit card points when they could be thinking about how to get promoted three times in the next year. Unless it brings you joy — some people love the game of credit card points — skip them.20. Consider a barbell approach to your investmentsA barbell has weights on the ends with nothing in between. A barbell investment approach would have the vast majority of your investments on the safe, simple, and steady side (e.g., index funds, bonds, cash) with the remainder having a high-risk, high-reward profile (e.g., startups, crypto). The goal is to get some exposure to the high rewards of the risky stuff, but without taking on too much risk because it's a small portion of your overall financial pie.21. SimplifyAccounts everywhere, investments you don't understand, obligations you can't track. This is how people lose control. Automate, consolidate, and reduce unnecessary friction. The simpler the system, the more likely you are to stay the course.22. Automate payments for recurring expensesEliminate the cognitive burden to free up headspace for executing on bigger opportunities that can help you earn more.23. Conduct a quarterly auditI've found hundreds of dollars in monthly burn through random subscriptions I never use and didn't know I had. Use your financial tracking tool to find and eliminate these.24. Tip generously whenever you canBe frugal with yourself and generous with others. Generosity creates significantly more happiness than consumption. 25. Use money as a tool for more meaningful forms of wealthI believe the best uses of money are those that create one of four things in your life: time, experiences with people you love, purpose, or health.Sahil Bloom is an entrepreneur, investor, and inspirational writer and content creator who writes the biweekly newsletter, The Curiosity Chronicle.

    "body": "For many Americans, buying your first home feels like a rite of passage. And while rising home prices and high mortgage rates may make it more difficult to put down roots, there are still favorable markets for first-time buyers that are close to major metropolitan areas like Washington, D.C., and Cleveland, Ohio.A recent report from Realtor.com ranks the best markets for first-time homebuyers. To determine the top markets, the report analyzed over 10,000 locations within the 100 largest metropolitan areas in the U.S., giving each a score out of 10 based on the following components: Affordability (25%)Local amenities (25%)Housing availability (10%)Young peers (10%)Commute quality (10%)Economic health (10%)Housing outlook (10%) Realtor.com then determined the 10 highest-ranking markets with at least 500 active for-sale listings from December 2024 to November 2025. Many of the markets from last year's ranking performed well this year and remain good options for first-time buyers, including Granite City, Illinois, and Birmingham, Alabama, Joel Berner, senior economist at Realtor.com, tells CNBC Make It. \"Affordability remains good, the amenities in the cities remain good and the fact that these prices are remaining attainable for younger owners or would-be owners is really impressive,\" Berner says. On the other hand, this year's ranking saw all Florida markets drop out of the top 10 best places for first-time homebuyers. Berner says the overall Realtor.com forecast for 2026, in terms of price and sales growth, is weak in Florida markets. \"We're expecting a pretty slow year in 2026 in Florida,\" Berner says. \"Even though there are good options there, we don't recommend those this year because we anticipate those homes actually falling in value.\" The report states that the fall in the value of Florida homes is due to softer prices and home sales projections. \"The main driver of price softness in Florida over the past several years is a growing supply of homes for sale at the same time that demand for those homes has weakened a bit,\" Berner said in a 2025 report. Rochester, N.Y., is the No. 1 market for first-time homebuyers Rochester, New York.Copyright Matt Kazmierski | Moment | Getty ImagesRochester, New York, ranked as the top market for first-time homebuyers with a score of 9.3. The median listing price for a home in the New York city is $139,900, which is below the national median of $399,950, according to Realtor.com. Realtor.com forecasts that in 2026, 25- to 34-year-olds will make up 21.3% of homeowners in Rochester. \"Rochester has quite a fair share of listings on the market, so there are a lot of options for buyers,\" Berner says. \"It's a nice town that is also a good place to raise a family.\"The best markets for first-time homebuyersRochester, N.Y.Harrisburg, Pa.Granite City, Ill.Birmingham, Ala.North Little Rock, Ark.Syracuse, N.Y.Baltimore, Md. St. Louis Park, Minn.Pittsburgh, Pa.Garfield Heights, OhioHarrisburg, Pennsylvania, ranked second among the top markets for first-time homebuyers in 2026 with a score of 9.3. The median listing price for a home in Harrisburg is $151,999.Harrisburg, PennsylvaniaRichard T. Nowitz | The Image Bank | Getty ImagesSimilar to Rochester, Berner says Harrisburg is seeing significant growth and offers options for buyers. \"They have more inventory than most places in that part of the country,\" he adds. Having so many midsize markets in the top 10, Berner says, points to the fact that these markets are becoming more popular than really big cities, but aren't necessarily totally rural areas. \"There are a lot of opportunities for young homebuyers to be part of that trend and build up some of these cities even further with young families,\" he says.

Stock Market Value: ~$3.16B ($53.08 per share) Activist: Engaged Capital  Ownership: 2.02% Average Cost: n/a Activist Commentary: Engaged Capital was founded by Glenn Welling, a former principal and managing director at Relational Investors. Engaged is an experienced and successful small-cap investor and makes investments with a two-to-five-year investment horizon. Its style is holding management and boards accountable behind closed doors. Engaged has an average return of 20.56% versus 17.83% for the Russell 2000. Of the firm's 39 past activist campaigns, nine of them have been at companies in the information technology sector.What's happeningOn Oct. 30, 2025, Engaged sent a letter calling on the BlackLine's board to immediately engage financial advisors and proactively run a strategic alternatives process following renewed acquisition interest from SAP SE. Nearly a month later, Engaged issued a so-called 220 Demand letter requesting access to board and strategic committee records related to all inbound acquisition interest, including a reported $66 per share offer from SAP SE on June 18, 2025. Earlier this month, Engaged announced that it plans to nominate the following four director candidates for election to BlackLine's board at the 2026 Annual Meeting: (i) Christopher Hetrick, director of research at Engaged Capital; (ii) Christopher Young, former head of contested situations at Jefferies; (iii) Christopher Hallenbeck, former senior vice president at SAP SE; and (iv) Storm Duncan, founder of technology-focused M&A advisory firm Ignatious.Behind the scenesBlackLine provides financial accounting solutions delivered primarily as Software as a Service (SaaS). This is a very prototypical enterprise software business, characterized by high gross margins (80%) and sticky offerings that are essential for large enterprises. Its largest of these clients is SAP SE, with whom BlackLine has a strategic partnership that contributes approximately 30% of the company's revenue. Historically, the business was focused on growth, and rightfully so, as it was compounding revenue at over 20% annually for many years, and the stock price grew along with that success. By the end of 2020 BlackLine was trading around $133, and Marc Huffman, who led the company through the global pandemic, was promoted from president to CEO, replacing founder Therese Tucker who took on the role of executive chair of the board. However, post Covid, growth began to decelerate, margins did not come up meaningfully to compensate, and the stock fell accordingly, trading as low as roughly $61 in December 2022.BlackLine was rumored to have been thrown a life raft in 2022, when Clearlake Capital, a private equity firm known for taking positions in select technology companies as a prelude to an acquisition offer, took a roughly 9% public position in BlackLine. There was also speculation that this development piqued the interest of SAP. This seemed like perfect timing: BlackLine's hyper growth had severely slowed and multiples in the space were as high as ever. It is hard to know what type of discussions go on in a boardroom, but an acquisition never happened. In March 2023, Huffman was replaced when Tucker returned to the company in a co-CEO structure with former Deloitte consultant Owen Ryan (until October 2025 when he was made sole CEO). Since Tucker's return, growth has continued to decline to high single digits and while margins have improved modestly, the company's stock is down another 24%. Despite all of this, history repeated itself when it was recently reported that SAP made an offer to acquire BlackLine in June, this time for $66 per share, an over 30% premium to the 60-day trading average at the time. At the time, the company's growth rate was also much lower than it was in 2022, and industry multiples have compressed significantly. BlackLine, despite creating no value in public markets over the last several years, reportedly rejected the approach.This refusal is what prompted Engaged Capital to send a letter calling on the BlackLine board to immediately engage financial advisors and proactively run a strategic alternatives process following renewed acquisition interest from SAP. Engaged is not advocating for a sale of the company at any price, nor does the board have a legal duty to engage every acquisition offer. But conscientious shareholders certainly have the right to question how a board addresses a potential material transaction, particularly when they feel the board is not acting in the best interest of shareholders. Activist investors like Engaged do not view this as a right but an obligation. So, Engaged is asking the board to evaluate the SAP offer and weigh it against any other offers and on a risk-adjusted basis against a standalone path. This request is reasonable under almost any circumstances, but even more so when the potential acquirer is the company's most important business relationship. While SAP may be the most logical partner, and likely the one ultimately willing to pay the biggest premium (estimated to be in the mid-70s). Given their existing strategic partnership, BlackLine meets the profile of an ideal fit for private equity. With stable reoccurring revenue and modest growth, the value here is all in the margins, and PE firms have consistently demonstrated their ability to build software businesses with 20% EBITDA margins, like BlackLine, and expand them upwards of 40% once private, such as Vista/Blackstone at Smartsheet and Francisco Partners/TPG at New Relic. Notably, Clearlake Capital continues to own a 9.6% position in BlackLine. The firm has taken similar positions in companies like Cornerstone OnDemand, which it acquired in 2021, and Blackbaud, which rejected Clearlake's takeout offer in March 2023 and then again in 2024.A lot has happened since Engaged first presented this thesis last October. Shortly thereafter, BlackLine disclosed that it has maintained an independent strategic committee of the board for more than a year, with members including David Henshall, who is serving as chairperson, Greg Hughes and Tom Unterman. Notably, Henshall has a history of getting companies sold as a director, including New Relic when it was engaged by Engaged. Following this announcement, Engaged issued a 220 Demand letter to the company requesting access to board and strategic committee records related to all inbound acquisition interest, including a reported $66 per share offer from SAP SE on June 18, 2025. Engaged expressed concerns about the disclosures around the company's strategic committee, noting that BlackLine only recently revealed the committee's existence and has still not disclosed key information around it, including when it was formed, its purpose, the scope, its authority and whether it has retained advisors. Earlier this month, Engaged announced that it plans to nominate the following four director candidates for election at the company's 2026 Annual Meeting: (i) Christopher Hetrick, director of research at Engaged Capital; (ii) Christopher Young, former head of contested situations at Jefferies; (iii) Christopher Hallenbeck, former SVP at SAP SE; and (iv) Storm Duncan, founder of technology -focused M&A advisory firm Ignatious.When assessing Engaged's chances of success in a proxy fight, there are several dynamics to consider. First, in late December, Unterman announced that he will not stand for re-election as a member of the board at the company's 2026 Annual Meeting. His impending departure creates both a board vacancy in a seat up for election in 2026, so at worst for Engaged, it will be running its slate of four against three incumbents and a new nominee. Second, Engaged will likely get the support of Clearlake (9.6%), one of the company's largest shareholders. Third, there are signs of shareholder discontent, as CEO Ryan received over 20% withhold votes last time he was up for election. Finally, and most significant, one of the four directors up for election is founder Therese Tucker. If she sees the smallest sign of being ousted from the company she founded, it could lead to a quick settlement or a sale of the company. BlackLine added two new directors in June and July of 2025, which the company will undoubtedly argue is evidence of good corporate governance and board refreshment. However, these directors are in the class up for re-election in 2027, and good corporate governance would dictate that they are voted on in the 2026 election so not to be on the board for two years without shareholder approval. This is something we used to see more of and certainly will not see amid a proxy fight. Finally, it is important to note that one of the directors up for election this year is Scott Davidson who was appointed to the board last year as part of the Scalar Gauge settlement. By targeting him, Engaged cannot necessarily rely on Scalar Gauge's support, but that firm only owns a 1.15% stake.Ken Squire is the founder and president of 13D Monitor, an institutional research service on shareholder activism, and the founder and portfolio manager of the 13D Activist Fund, a mutual fund that invests in a portfolio of activist investments.",

Mandel Ngan | Afp | Getty ImagesPresident Donald Trump on Saturday warned Canada that the U.S. would impose 100% tariff on goods sold in the U.S. if the country strikes a trade deal with China.\"If Canada makes a deal with China, it will immediately be hit with a 100% Tariff against all Canadian goods and products coming into the U.S.A.,\" the president wrote in a Truth Social post.Trump also suggested Saturday that China would try to use Canada to try to avoid paying U.S. tariffs. \"If Governor Carney thinks he is going to make Canada a 'Drop Off Port' for China to send goods and products into the United States, he is sorely mistaken,\" Trump stated.Earlier this month, Prime Minister Mark Carney announced that Canada and China reached a preliminary deal to remove trade barriers and lower tariffs. Under the tentative agreement, Beijing cut tariffs on some Canadian agricultural products, while Ottawa increased the quotas for imports of Chinese electric vehicles, applying the most-favored-nation tariff rate of 6.1%. Just a week ago, Trump had voiced his support for Carney on the China trade deal.\"That's what he should be doing. It's a good thing for him to sign a trade deal. If you can get a deal with China, you should do that,\" Trump told reporters at the White House on Jan. 16.\"Canada's government has transparently outlined that the agreement with China is fundamentally about domestic consumers and businesses in Canada and China, not schemes aimed at other markets,\" Matthew Holmes, executive vice president and chief of public policy of the Canadian Chamber of Commerce said in a statement.\"A structured and stable relationship with China or any other country ... are not to replace our deeply rooted relationship with the United States that continues to be overwhelmingly good for workers, consumers and North American competitiveness,\" he added.   The White House and the office of the Canadian prime minister didn't immediately respond to a CNBC request for comment.Read more CNBC politics coverageGreenland PM: Trump-NATO deal framework unclear, sovereignty is a red lineTrump sues Jamie Dimon, JPMorgan Chase over debanking the suit calls 'political'Trump says he reached Greenland deal 'framework' with NATO, backs off tariffsTrump interview live updates: CNBC's Joe Kernen sits down with the president at DavosRussia watches as ally Iran edges closer to collapse.

The new tariff threat comes one day after Trump withdrew the invitation to Canada to join his \"Board of Peace\" after Carney's address at the World Economic Forum in Davos that cautioned against economic coercion by the world's superpowers.In his speech, Carney said the world's \"middle powers\" must band together to resist coercion from the world's largest powers.Carney said last week that he intended to join the board but the details hadn't been worked out.

    "body": "A pharmacist displays a box of Wegovy pills at a pharmacy in Provo, Utah, Jan. 15, 2026.George Frey | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesThe future of the booming obesity drug market won't hinge on drugs that deliver greater weight loss alone. Top executives from drugmakers big and small told CNBC that the next phase of the space will be defined by a broader range of treatment options and improved access for patients. Those were among the themes that emerged at the annual JPMorgan Healthcare Conference in San Francisco during interviews with top brass from Eli Lilly, Novo Nordisk, Pfizer and other drugmakers. \"We really see the obesity market going from, in this year, a one-size-fits-all kind of idea to different medicines for different patients. We don't have a crystal ball to know how that all sorts out,\" Dan Skovronsky, Eli Lilly's chief scientific officer, told CNBC in an interview at the conference.\"But I think by presenting people with options, they'll pick for themselves with their doctors, and I think we want to have something for everyone,\" he continued. \"And we're not done yet.\" Over the coming years, executives expect an expanding menu of obesity treatments that can be tailored to an individual patient's needs — from pills and less-frequent injections to combination regimens and drugs designed to preserve muscle mass while promoting weight loss. Some also expect the direct-to-consumer market to become an even larger slice of the market, while hoping that hurdles preventing patients from getting treatment continue to fall.Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly are widely credited with establishing the market through their weekly GLP-1 injections for obesity and diabetes, which have surged in popularity in recent years. The next chapter is already taking shape, with Novo launching the first GLP-1 pill for obesity earlier this month and Lilly preparing to bring an oral option of its own to market later this year. While those companies will play a critical role in how the space evolves, other players from pharma titan Pfizer to little-known upstarts could also enter the market — both threatening the two rivals' sales dominance and offering more treatment alternatives for consumers.While access remains a challenge for many patients, the ability to get GLP-1s has improved notably over the past year. Both Novo and Lilly have slashed cash prices for their injections and struck deals with President Donald Trump in November that will, for the first time, introduce Medicare coverage for obesity drugs later this year.More treatment options and wider access could boost the case for analyst projections that say the weight loss and diabetes drug market could be worth almost $100 billion annually by the end of the decade. In an interview at the conference, Novo Nordisk CEO Mike Doustdar said the company and Lilly currently have around 15 million people combined who have obesity taking GLP-1s. There is still a \"long tail\" to reaching the 110 million that are reportedly suffering from the condition, along with those who are overweight, he added. In a May report, McKinsey said it expects a range of 25 to 50 million U.S. patients to use GLP-1s by 2030. Here's what executives say the future of the space could look like. The pill potentialPills have not yet proven more effective than injections. Still, the consensus among executives is that oral options could expand the market, reaching entirely new patients. That may include people who are afraid of needles, as well as people who could benefit from existing injections but don't view their condition as severe enough to warrant a weekly shot.In an interview at the conference, Doustdar said it could also include people who travel frequently and can't easily refrigerate injections. \"There is so much aligned exactly with this market expansion story … because there is a huge number of patients that are simply not interested in losing weight at the cost of injecting themselves,\" Doustdar said. The \"real growth\" and uptake of the pills is going to come from primary care physicians, who write the majority of prescriptions for Americans and typically prefer pills to injections, said Ray Stevens, the CEO of obesity market hopeful Structure Therapeutics. He said he believes his company's GLP-1 pill, aleniglipron, will be the third to enter the market after Eli Lilly's and Novo Nordisk's. Structure's oral drug will enter Phase 3 trials this year. Daily pills can offer more flexibility to patients. For example, Stevens said a patient could cut a pill in half to mitigate side effects on a day when they have an important meeting to attend. Lilly's Skovronsky said pills will also serve as a way for patients to \"deescalate their therapy\" after taking injections. The company in December released data showing that patients who initially took Wegovy or Zepbound shots maintained the majority of their weight loss after switching to Lilly's pill. \"They say, 'I've lost the weight, I've got this, so I can maintain this on my own with something less strong,'\" Skovronsky said. Structure is also developing an oral drugs that targets amylin, an emerging form of weight loss treatment that mimics a hormone co-secreted with insulin in the pancreas to suppress appetite and reduce food intake. Novo is developing a medicine called amycretin, which targets both GLP-1 and amylin to offer potentially enhanced weight loss. Mixing and matching drugsStevens said combination regimens are \"going to be the next phase of the field.\" For example, Structure hopes to combine its oral GLP-1 and amylin drugs to achieve even greater weight loss than one alone would, which he said will likely be \"one of the best combos of the future.\" It's too early to say which patients would be the best fit for that regimen, but Stevens said it could achieve \"good tolerability, really good patient experience and good efficacy.\" He said the company is already working on manufacturing the two ingredients together in a single pill, which is similar to what Novo's amycretin achieves. But he said combination regimens can also help treat certain obesity-related conditions better than one product alone. That could look like combining a GLP-1 with one of the existing treatments for fatty liver disease. \"I feel like the winners are now starting to emerge for the monotherapy\" treatments, he said. But Stevens said the treatment patients take will segment according to the other health conditions a person has on top of obesity, such as fatty liver disease, chronic kidney disease and cardiovascular disease. Lilly's upcoming pill is an oral GLP-1, but Skovronsky said the company can see the potential for a pill that targets that hormone along with another called GIP, since that's a \"preferred formulation.\" That's how tirzepatide, the active ingredient in Lilly's blockbuster obesity and diabetes injections, works. That drug has proven to be more effective than semaglutide, the active ingredient in Novo Nordisk's rival injections, which only targets GLP-1. Skovronsky said, \"we're working hard to create those medicines\" in an oral form, but aren't ready to disclose any details. Pfizer inherited several experimental injections and pills with combination potential from its roughly $10 billion acquisition of the obesity biotech Metsera last year. But Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla said the company is also developing an in-house oral drug that blocks the GIP receptor, which can significantly reduce side effects when combined with GLP-1. \"I have very high hopes that it will also differentiate,\" Bourla said.One biotech, Wave Life Sciences, also sees combinations as part of its broader strategy, its CEO Paul Bolno said in an interview at the conference. Different weight loss methodsWave is taking a different approach to weight loss, targeting how the body burns fat rather than suppressing appetite. The goal is to achieve comparable weight loss to GLP-1s, without the associated muscle loss, and with less frequent dosing of once or twice a year rather than weekly. That push comes amid growing focus on the quality of weight loss with next-generation obesity drugs, as GLP-1 treatments have raised concerns around muscle loss, side effects and patient drop-offs.Wave has an experimental injection that uses RNA technology to lower levels of a protein called activin E – a liver-produced protein that slows fat burning. By reducing that protein, Wave believes the drug can increase fat loss, particularly harmful visceral fat, while preserving lean muscle mass. Bolno said the company is developing the injection, called WVE-007, as a monotherapy or a potential maintenance treatment that patients can switch to and take far less frequently after being on GLP-1s.But he also sees the opportunity to combine the company's injection with GLP-1s to \"continue to drive benefits.\" \"We can double the weight loss on GLP-1s in combination,\" Bolno said, referring to what the company is seeing in preclinical research. He said adding Wave's injection on top of a GLP-1 won't make it more difficult for patients to tolerate the treatment regimen, so it makes the company's drug \"very amenable to combination\" options.As for who can use Wave's injection, Bolno said it will work for any patient since \"this happens to be a target that's actually in human genetics.\"The future of the industry will likely also include drugs that can achieve even greater weight loss than the current treatments on the market. Lilly in December released the first late-stage data on an injectable drug called retatrutide, the highest dose of which achieved more than 28% weight loss at 68 weeks among patients who stayed on the treatment. Lilly will read out data on seven other Phase 3 trials on the drug this year. Dubbed the \"triple G\" drug, retatrutide works by mimicking three hunger-regulating hormones — GLP-1, GIP and glucagon — rather than just one or two. That appears to have more potent effects on a person's appetite and satisfaction with food than other treatments. Skovronsky said the drug could serve patients who need additional weight loss or have other severe health conditions on top of obesity, such as arthritis knee pain. Novo Nordisk is racing to catch up: In March, it agreed to pay up to $2 billion for the rights to an early experimental drug from Chinese drugmaker United Laboratories International. The newly acquired treatment is a clear potential competitor to retatrutide because it similarly uses a three-pronged approach to promoting weight loss and regulating blood sugar.Patient access to drugsThe industry has made strides toward improving drug access for patients, and executives expect that will continue. The cash price of Novo's pill is already the lowest seen on the market, at $149 for the starting dose and up to $299 for the higher doses. GLP-1 injections are roughly $1,000 per month before insurance and without recent cash discounts.Both Pfizer's Bourla and Lilly's Skovronsky said upcoming Medicare coverage of obesity drugs should also move the needle with coverage. \"Once the government starts covering it in Medicare, it probably will become more and more uncomfortable for employers to not — it's that societal pressure,\" Skovronsky said. He also pointed to an \"activation of consumers,\" where patients are starting to call their employers and ask why their benefits don't cover obesity drugs. Drugmakers, researchers and scientists are also generating more data about the benefits of obesity drugs for health-care spending, which could help spur more employer coverage, Skovronsky said. \"So for employers, is there less absenteeism? Is there better productivity? Is there better medical costs?\" he said. \"The data's coming in, and we're seeing more and more of that.\" In terms of the direct-to-consumer channel, Skovronsky said it may become the \"fastest-growing segment\" of the space given the recent push for drugmakers to launch cash offerings. Lilly was among the first companies to launch a direct-to-consumer platform in 2024 offering its obesity drug Zepbound at a discount, and Novo followed more than a year later. Bourla estimated that the direct-to-consumer channel already makes up 30% of the obesity and diabetes drug market in the U.S. It could become closer to 90% or more of that market abroad, he added. When asked about what the broader market will look like by 2030, Structure's Stevens said he hopes access and affordability are no longer issues.\"I'm okay with the cost dropping because, to me, this has always been about volume and really trying to address a very large unmet need globally itself,\" he said.",

    "body": "A federal agent cordons off the area as people gather at the scene of a shooting involving federal immigration agents in Minneapolis, Minnesota, on Jan. 24, 2026.Tim Evans | ReutersMinnesota Gov. Tim Walz on Saturday called on President Donald Trump to end sweeping Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) operations in the state after a second fatal shooting this month by federal agents in Minneapolis.\"I just spoke with the White House after another horrific shooting by federal agents this morning,\" Walz wrote in a post on X. \"Minnesota has had it. This is sickening. The President must end this operation. Pull the thousands of violent, untrained officers out of Minnesota. Now.\"At a briefing Saturday afternoon, Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O'Hara said authorities had identified the victim as a 37-year-old white male and Minneapolis resident, adding that the man had no known criminal history beyond traffic citations. The man was later identified as ICU nurse Alex Pretti by his parents and the Associated Press.\"The only interaction that we are aware of with law enforcement has been for traffic tickets, and we believe he is a lawful gun owner with a permit,\" O'Hara said, though he noted details surrounding the encounter remain under review.O'Hara said his department has been in touch with the Department of Homeland Security, but that it has not provided specific details around the incident itself.The latest shooting adds to a tense standoff between Minnesota authorities and federal immigration agents that has persisted for weeks. Earlier this month, an ICE agent fatally shot Renee Nicole Good, a 37-year-old Minneapolis resident, during an enforcement action, which triggered widespread protests and accelerated political backlash against the federal operation.\"At 9:05 AM CT, as DHS law enforcement officers were conducting a targeted operation in Minneapolis against an illegal alien wanted for violent assault,\" a DHS spokesperson said in a statement on X. \"An individual approached US Border Patrol officers with a 9 mm semi-automatic handgun, seen here.\"A handgun which the Department of Homeland Security says was recovered from a man who was shot during his arrest, is seen in a location given as Minneapolis, Minnesota, U.S., in this handout picture released on Jan. 24, 2026.Homeland Security Via X | Via ReutersFederal agents attempted to disarm the suspect but the suspect violently resisted, DHS said: \"More details on the armed struggle are forthcoming.\"About 200 protestors arrived at the scene, the department said, and \"crowd control measures were deployed for the safety of the public and law enforcement.\"Customs and Border Patrol chief Greg Bovino said in a news conference Saturday afternoon that the federal agent involved in the shooting has been with the agency for eight years.Tear gas clouds during clashes between federal agents and community members at the scene of a shooting involving federal immigration agents in Minneapolis, Minnesota, on Jan. 24, 2026. Tim Evans | ReutersTrump responded to the shooting in a Truth Social post, defending the federal operation and condemning criticism of his immigration enforcement surge.\"This is the gunman's gun, loaded (with two additional full magazines!), and ready to go – What is that all about? Where are the local Police? Why weren't they allowed to protect ICE Officers?\" he wrote. \"The Mayor and the Governor called them off? It is stated that many of these Police were not allowed to do their job, that ICE had to protect themselves — Not an easy thing to do!\"In a news conference Saturday evening, DHS Secretary Kristi Noem portrayed Pretti as a man intent on violence against federal agents: \"This looks like a situation where an individual arrived at the scene to inflict maximum damage on individuals and to kill law enforcement.\"When asked if the 37-year-old ever pointed his weapon at federal agents, Noem sidestepped the question and instead asked why an individual would bring a gun to a protest.But despite Noem's claims, multiple videos by bystanders and observers at the scene of the shooting published on social media appear to tell a different story. In one video obtained by The Associated Press, protesters can be heard blowing whistles and shouting profanities at agents on Nicollet Avenue.The video shows an officer shoving a person who is wearing a brown jacket, skirt and black tights and carrying a water bottle. That person reaches out for a man and the two link up, embracing. The man, wearing a brown jacket and black hat, seems to be holding his phone up toward the officer.The same officer shoves the man in his chest and the two, still embracing, fall back.The video then shifts to a different part of the street and then comes back to the two individuals unlinking from each other. The video shifts focus again and then shows three officers surrounding the man.Soon, at least seven officers surround the man. One is on the man's back, and another, who appears to have a canister in his hand, strikes a blow to the man's chest. Several officers try to bring the man's arms behind his back as he appears to resist. As they pull his arms, his face is briefly visible on camera. The officer with the canister strikes the man near his head several times.A shot rings out, but with officers surrounding the man, it's not clear from where the shot came. Multiple officers back off of the man after the shot. More shots are heard. Officers back away and the man lies motionless on the street.In another video, seen by CNBC, it appears a federal officer removes a weapon from the man on the ground before any shots are fired. The DHS said it is planning to investigate the shooting, rather than the FBI, two sources told MS Now.In response to a request from Hennepin County Sheriff Dawanna Witt, Walz on Saturday afternoon agreed to activate the Minnesota National Guard to support first responders. \"The Minnesota National Guard's role is to work in support of local law enforcement and emergency responders, providing additional resources. Their presence is meant to help create a secure environment where all Minnesotans can exercise their rights safely, including the right to peacefully protest,\" according to the sheriff department's statement.Minneapolis officials urged the public to avoid the area and remain calm as local law enforcement and state patrol units arrived to separate protesters from the ICE personnel, The Minnesota Star Tribune reported.Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., joined the governor's call for ICE to end its operations in Minnesota.\"The world is watching. Thousands of citizens stopped and harassed. Local police no longer able to do their work. Kids hiding. Schools closed. Get ICE out of Minnesota NOW,\" she said in an X post.But Trump administration officials placed the blame for the shooting on the armed man.

    "body": "watch nowElon Musk's pay package of up to $1 trillion highlights the continued escalation in CEO compensation, even as worker pay slows and rewards to shareholders remain mixed, according to several studies.  Already, Musk is the richest person on the planet with a net worth that tops $660 billion, according to Bloomberg. Musk saw his 2018 Tesla pay package -- now valued at over $130 billion -- reinstated in December, and his company SpaceX looks set to for a potential public offering in 2026. Those two events could well put Musk on his way to becoming the world's first trillionaire this year. In addition, his new pay package, valued at up to $1 trillion, could also start paying out over the next decade.While Musk may be an outlier, his stock-fueled gains highlight the booming compensation and wealth gains of CEOs in recent decades that has been driven by rising stock markets and a broader adoption of stock-centric pay packages Over the past 50 years, top CEO compensation has climbed 1,094%, according to the Economic Policy Institute. That compares to a 26% increase in typical worker compensation. Median total compensation for S&P 500 CEO's was $17.1 million in 2024, up nearly 10% from 2023, according to Equilar, a corporate analytics firm. CEOs now make 192 times more than the average employee, up from a 186 to 1 ratio in 2023. Tesla CEO Elon Musk attends the Saudi-U.S. Investment Forum, in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, May 13, 2025. Hamad I Mohammed | ReutersDriving the acceleration in CEO pay is a shift in the types of stock awards used to incentivize and reward corporate chiefs. CEO compensation typically includes four categories: salaries, long-term incentives, short-term incentives and perks. Long-term and short-term incentives are largely stock awards, and make up far and away the largest portion of CEO compensation. Stock awards accounted for 72% of CEO pay packages in 2024, with the median value increasing 15% that year, according to Equilar. Musk's trillion-dollar pay package, for instance, doesn't include any salary. The potential value of the $1 trillion would come entirely from stock awards pegged to various targets. For Musk to get the full payout, Tesla must hit key milestones, including certain market capitalization and operational achievements. He could still earn billions in stock even if Tesla doesn't meet all the targets.\"Milestone achievements built into CEO pay packages could be the norm in the future,\" said Amit Batish, senior director marketing at Equilar.Company boards and CEOs themselves say that because their pay is tied closely to stock performance, their compensation reflects the larger wealth created for shareholders. The CEO only does well if shareholders do well, they argue. If stocks plummet, CEO's can also see big pay drops. Others others argue that CEO's have only a partial impact on their companies' share price. A 2021 MSCI study of top executive pay between 2006 and 2020 found a weak correlation between higher CEO pay and company performance. \"This notion that the guy in the corner office is somehow almost single handedly responsible for company value, and everyone else is just little minions who don't contribute much of anything ... everyone can see that is not true,\" said Sarah Anderson, at the Institute for Policy Studies. Tesla's Optimus robots walk on the day of an unveiling event in Los Angeles, California, U.S. October 10, 2024, in this still image taken from a video.Tesla | Via ReutersAccording to the 2021 MSCI study, average performing CEO's took home only 4% less in realized pay than top-performing CEOs. More importantly, CEO's with the lowest awarded pay saw the strongest returns for shareholders.\"When we measured pay and performance against CEO tenure, we found little evidence that high CEO pay achieved this lofty goal of CEO incentivization,\" according to MSCI, an investment research firm.Since the 1990s, company boards have shifted away from stock options, which incentivize short-term performance, with stock awards, which boards argue are driven by longer-term incentives. Shareholders of publicly traded companies can now vote in an advisory capacity on CEO pay, known as \"say on pay\" votes, but company boards have final say when it comes to compensation packages.While restraining CEO pay has proven ineffective, given the natural \"ratcheting up\" of median CEO pay by board compensation committees, some economists advocate more stock awards for employees to help close the gap between employees and CEOs. Employee Stock Ownership Plans, or ESOPs, for instance, are qualified retirement plans that give employees shares in the company through a trust. Employees who can partake in ESOPs tend to end up with better financial security, said Loren Rodgers, executive director of the National Center for Employee Ownership. That in turn benefits their companies, he said. \"Employee-owned businesses are more productive,\" Rodgers said. \"They're more able to recruit people. People quit at lower rates. They're more competitive.\"Watch the video above to hear more about the uptick in CEO pay and what is driving these massive pay outs.",

    "body": "KANGERLUSSUAQ, GREENLAND - JULY 09: Passenger planes for local flights of Air Greenland stand on the tarmac at the airport as signs show the flight times to various global destinations on July 09, 2024 in Kangerlussuaq, Greenland. (Photo by Sean Gallup/Getty Images)Sean Gallup | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesA former official of U.S. President Donald Trump's first administration is planning a multi-billion-dollar data center project in a remote corner of Greenland, as hyperscalers scramble to build out capacity across the globe to keep up with the AI rollout.The data center is aiming to be operational at 300 megawatts (MW) by mid-2027, before further expansion would see it hit 1.5 gigawatts (GW) by the end of 2028.While that's currently several times the power capacity of any active data center in the world, there are plans to build multiple 1 GW-plus facilities across the globe over the next two years as the race to develop AI infrastructure continues to gather pace.The Greenland data center project will cost billions of dollars to complete and has binding commitments with investors to finance half of its initial phase of development and half of the final phase, Drew Horn, a senior aide to Trump's first-term vice president Mike Pence and CEO of GreenMet, a company that's offering strategic support to the project, told CNBC. The venture is eyeing a buildout in the Kangerlussuaq area, a small settlement at the end of a deep fjord on the southwest coast of the Arctic island, with an airport, he added.Technical partners have been enlisted to help with the physical buildout, but the project has yet to secure land or approvals from the local authorities, Horn said. He declined to share the names of the other companies involved in the venture because the information isn't public yet.Commercial opportunities in Greenland have been thrust into the spotlight in recent weeks as the Arctic island has become the center of a geopolitical firestorm after U.S. President Donald Trump doubled down on acquisition talk. Critical minerals mining and freshwater reserves have been touted as potential prospects, though skeptics point to logistical challenges around tapping into them with Greenland's limited infrastructure.  watch nowMulti-billion-dollar data centerData center deals hit a record $61 billion in 2025 amid a rush to build out the infrastructure needed to power energy-intensive AI workloads. Big tech firms, including Meta, OpenAI, Oracle, AWS, Microsoft and Google are investing huge sums into developing facilities across the globe. Work on plans for the Greenland data center project began a year ago, and Horn told CNBC it has secured technical partners to assist with construction, operation and supplying energy.Committed financing, which is in the form of debt and equity, is contingent on the project meeting key milestones, including securing permits from local government, said Horn — who was also a senior advisor to both the energy and intelligence departments towards the end of Trump's first term.Other former senior Trump employees also have stakes in GreenMet, which says on its website that it helps companies with government and private funding and strategic partnerships.  George Sorial, who was an executive vice president and chief compliance counsel at the Trump Organization until 2019, and Keith Schiller, who was a longtime bodyguard for Trump and director of Oval Office operations during the U.S. president's first term, helped set up the company in 2021 and remain shareholders.\"We are not actively involved with GreenMet or Greenland,\" Sorial told CNBC. \"We are passive minority shareholders in GreenMet and have no management role in the company.\" Schiller had not responded to a CNBC request for comment as this story went live.The GreenMet CEO has been developing relationships with officials in the Greenlandic and Danish administrations as he looks to advance the project. He met the Danish Ambassador to the U.S. Jesper Møller Sørensen on Wednesday, as part of a \"continuing dialogue,\" to discuss the data center, Horn said. CNBC has approached Denmark's U.S. embassy for comment.While officials on all sides have been supportive of the project, the \"issue is not so much on the private side, it's on the diplomatic,\" Horn said, pointing to the geopolitical tensions surrounding the U.S. push to acquire Greenland, a semi-autonomous Danish territory.Tensions have cooled since Trump backtracked on plans to impose tariffs on several European nations over the issue, but questions still remain as negotiations around U.S. military and economic involvement in Greenland continue.\"Our effort, which is purely private, it succeeds only if we have the buy-in from the relevant affected parties and countries,\" Horn said.Securing power\"Larger corporate entities\" will be taking the lead on the construction and development of the data center, but GreenMet will continue to be involved as an advisor as the project looks to secure government investment from nations including the U.S., Greenland, Denmark, and other NATO countries, Horn told CNBC. \"We've spent about a year putting together everything from the power to the technology components, [and] we have a Greenlandic partner on the ground,\" Horn said. \"Right now we're waiting on approvals from the Greenlandic side.\"A big challenge for projects of this scale in Greenland is access to power. For the first phase of the project, which is targeting 300 MW power capacity, the plan is to use specialized barges carrying Liquefied Natural Gas to the fjord, Horn said.The venture plans to build a hydroelectric facility — 70% of the island's energy comes from such facilities — to power the second phase, which would see the data center hit 1.5 GW capacity. Permits and approvals from the Greenlandic government are still pending for both the barges and the facility. Greenland's Ministry of Business has been approached for comment.Kangerlussuaq Fjord. Large iceberg in scenic fjord surrounded by snow-capped mountains, Southeast coast, Greenland.Vw Pics | Universal Images Group | Getty ImagesHorn argues that if local authorities greenlight the large hydroelectric facility, energy prices will make the project commercially viable long-term. There are some significant advantages to building data centers in an environment with low temperatures, analysts told CNBC.\"The biggest value sits in its resource profile, specifically in hydro for electricity generation and a 'free cooling' proposition given the lower ambient temperature,\" Noah Ramos, strategist at investment research firm Alpine Macro, told CNBC.But there are hurdles the project will have to overcome. \"Building in the Arctic is capital intensive; construction seasons are short, and the heat from the servers can melt the very ground the building sits on... specialized engineering is needed,\" Ramos said.Nvidia is also touting a new generation of chips that require less cooling. \"It's early days, but if future generations of chips are even more efficient in this regard, it could negate the need for expensive data centre build outs in places like Greenland,\" Michael Field, chief equity strategist at Morningstar, told CNBC.watch now",

    "body": "Benito Aguilar | Twenty20Jason Gewirtz is vice president of news at CNBC.  What follows is a personal account of his experience with a scammer.Last week my cell phone rang. It was about 1:30 p.m., and the iPhone ID showed the 650 area code, which I recognized as the San Francisco Bay Area. The caller ID listed the number as unknown but labeled it as coming from San Francisco.Given San Francisco's position in the heart of global innovation and technology and that it's the location of one of CNBC's key bureaus, I picked up despite not knowing who was calling, something people rarely do anymore.The voice on the other end introduced himself as Brian Miller from Coinbase's security office. He quickly told me there was \"suspicious activity\" on my account and wanted to know if I was trying to log in from Frankfurt, Germany, on an iPhone. I told him, \"No, I haven't been in Germany in 20 years, and I never use my cell phone to log into my Coinbase account.\"  He told me someone with an address of \"Mohamad25@gmail.com\" was in my Coinbase account and had tried to make a transfer. The man claiming to be Miller then said, \"I haven't seen this one before. He's saying he lost his phone on a conveyor belt at the airport in Frankfurt and needs access.\" Miller stopped for a second and then said, \"He's trying to make another transfer right now.\"He continued, \"I'm trying to figure out how he got access, he has your Social Security number, your phone and your email address. He also gave us a photo that matches your Coinbase face scan. Have you given anyone access to your information lately or have you noticed anything else suspicious on other accounts?\" \"No,\" I said.Looking back it's pretty clear, even to me, the attempted scam used classic pressure tactics to get me to feel like I was in danger, so I'd make a fast decision, rather than a smart one.\"They try to make you scared by making you feel like you're the victim, and they're calling to help,\" said Rick Wash, professor of information science at the University of Wisconsin, in a phone interview. Wash is a computer scientist who researched the possibility of electronic breaches two decades ago. He then began mixing his vast technical knowledge to focus on the personal side of the scam. \"I began to realize the human factor was often the most critical factor of computer scams,\" Wash said.watch nowWhile something always seemed out of place, my suspicions grew when Miller mentioned my photo. \"I never gave Coinbase my photo,\" I told him.  He said, \"In order to get an account you would have had to. You might not remember doing it but we have to have it due to know-your-customer rules.\" Miller then told me, \"He's trying to make another transfer, but I have it on hold so he can't.\"I asked him to please send me an email so I know that he's really calling from Coinbase. He said, \"I just sent you a case number about 10 seconds ago, you should have it.\" Then he asked if I had something to write with, and he read me a six-digit number. I told him that the email didn't arrive.  \"Let me send another one,\" he said. \"This will have a new case number.\" He read a second number and then said, \"I'll wait until you get the email. You might not get it in your inbox because he's trying to change your email address. Check your spam.\"  Both messages were in the spam folder from what appeared to be a Coinbase email.  The messages had the same confirmation codes as the ones he gave me on the phone. There were no typos, there was a Coinbase logo and a text box with all the key information. The email address appeared to have come from Coinbase, but I thought it was odd it didn't have Miller's name on it. Then I spotted another sign that something wasn't right: The two emails came from slightly different addresses. One said \"no-reply@mail-coinbase.com via sportuel.com,\" and the other said \"support@info.coinbase via live-coinbase.com.\"He asked, \"When was your last Coinbase transaction?\" I thought for a few seconds and then remembered buying a very small amount of \"Monad\" which I'd never heard of before a guest mentioned it on \"Squawk Box\" last month. Read more CNBC reporting on AIThis Meta alum has spent 10 months leading OpenAI's nationwide hunt for its Stargate data centersAI Sam Altman and the Sora copyright gamble: 'I hope Nintendo doesn't sue us'Anthropic launches Claude Sonnet 4.5, its latest AI model that's 'more of a colleague'Sam Altman on worries about OpenAI’s $850 billion in planned buildouts: ‘I totally get that’When he followed by asking, \"What are your total assets?\" I responded, \"Shouldn't you know that?\" He said, \"Due to confidentiality, I can't say.\" So, I gave him a wide range, being embarrassed about how little money I had, and starting to realize that something wasn't right.Miller then told me I really needed a \"Coinbase Hard Wallet\" and asked if I was familiar with that. I said I was not. He offered to help me set it up.  I asked, \"First should I change my Gmail password?\" \"Probably a good idea,\" he said.Then I asked, \"Shouldn't I change my Coinbase password?\"At that point, he hesitated and said, \"We don't recommend that. Right now I have your account on hold. If you change your password, it will freeze it for up to two weeks.\"  I told Miller that I had a meeting in five minutes and asked how long it would take to get the Coinbase Hard Wallet. He told me 20 minutes. I said I had to go, but I asked if we could talk again at 3 p.m. He promised to call me back.Close callWhen I hung up, I tried to figure out what to do next.  It didn't seem right but several details lined up.  I checked my account. Nothing seemed out of order.Then I took the email addresses he had sent. I copied them and asked Claude, Anthropic's AI chatbot, if they were legitimate. The response came back, \"This is almost certainly a PHISHING scam.\"Several red flags popped up, including that the messages were coming from the wrong domain. \"The real Coinbase sends emails from @coinbase.com, not @live-coinbase.com. That hyphenated domain is a classic phishing tactic,\" according to the AI program's notes. Claude also flagged the suspicious \"via\" address: \"Legitimate companies don't route emails through third-party domains like this,\" according to the AI program.I said to myself, \"Thanks, Claude,\" while also thinking, \"That was close.\" I called an old contact in Coinbase's public relations department who told me, \"I don't work there anymore, but that's probably a scam. Coinbase doesn't call people.\"  She promised to send details on my situation to the current team at Coinbase who texted and called within a few minutes confirming it was a scam. The caller ID lit up on phone, \"Coinbase\" and because I expected the call, I was willing to trust it despite being a little nervous at first. I told the Coinbase representative I'd write up the whole 15-minute call for her so they could hopefully use it to warn others… then decided, maybe this would be a good article for CNBC.com.  Coinbase agreed. A spokesperson who often deals with security issues said the company has ways to prevent people from being scammed, even when the victim falls for it, including watching for large transfers or sudden sales from accounts that don't often transfer or sell crypto. A smartphone with the Coinbase logo and representation of cryptocurrencies are placed on a keyboard in this photo taken June 8, 2023.Dado Ruvic | Reuters\"We invest heavily in prevention, detection, and rapid response,\" the spokesperson said in an email. The rep added that Coinbase would never tell a customer to transfer crypto into a safe wallet. \"If someone tells you to move funds to protect them, it's a scam,\" the spokesperson said.Coinbase also acknowledged that artificial intelligence was a multiplying factor in scam attempts and the quality of scams. \"Attackers use a variety of bots and AI automations to make their workflows easier\" the company said, noting that AI voice agents are being used \"to create more believable automated calls.\"According to ZeroShadow, a firm that tries to return stolen crypto assets back to their rightful owners, their systems have seen a 1,400% increase in \"impersonation scams\" in the last year. \"The attacks come from inside and outside of the U.S., but the people behind the scams often try to hire young men or teenagers, people who have less inhibition, and train them,\" said Casey G., ZeroShadow's CEO, who asked that his full last name be withheld because of security threats. \"They sell them scripts and sometimes voice modulation devices.\"The CEO said his firm has recovered about $200 million for victims over the last four years, but he admits it's a difficult process. \"Once the crypto is out of your account, we can trace it, but getting it back isn't so easy,\" he said. \"We need help from local authorities. Crypto has less protection than the traditional banking system in the U.S.\" Casey G. also said AI is being used by scam chiefs to multiply their workforce.One of the most successful techniques the scammer used was creating a sense of urgency. By telling me there was an ongoing attempt while we were on the phone, I was almost tricked into taking action or giving up information. I felt my pulse racing and had an instinct to stop whatever was happening.  Anti-scam experts say that's a common tactic that's getting more sophisticated as bad actors buy and sell successful \"scam scripts\" on the dark web. Coinbase said it advises people to \"slow down, take a beat, verify things independently and don't act under pressure.\"Be careful out there.WATCH: The alarming rise of AI 'nudify' appswatch now",

    "body": "Fiordaliso | Moment | Getty ImagesOver the last few years, Emma Kobil, a trauma counselor in Denver, started noticing a new topic coming up with her patients: artificial intelligence. \"I've had clients lose their jobs due to AI, and it's something we've processed in our sessions,\" Kobil said. Often, they express \"shock, disbelief and fear about navigating a changing career landscape where their skills are no longer needed,\" she said. Other therapists said the technology is also vexing their patients. \"What I hear most often is a fear of becoming obsolete,\" said Harvey Lieberman, a clinical psychologist in New York. \"People start questioning their judgment, their choices or their future.\" More than a third — or 38% — of workers said they worry AI will make some or all of their job duties outdated in the future, according to a July 2025 survey by the American Psychological Association. These fears are not unfounded, said Rhiannon Batchelder, a career coach based in Denver. \"Some employees are being asked to create pitches for how AI can take over portions of their job,\" Batchelder said. \"Among news of mass layoffs while CEO pay continues to rise, being replaced by technology just feels like another reason to lose hope in the possibility of a stable, fulfilling career.\" AI was a major factor leading to nearly 55,000 layoffs in the U.S. in 2025, according to December data from consulting firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas. Overall, around 1.2 million jobs were cut in the year. Meanwhile, a recent Massachusetts Institute of Technology study found that AI can already replace around 11% of the U.S. labor market. Salesforce's CEO, Marc Benioff, said 4,000 customer support workers had been let go because artificial intelligence was already doing 50% of the work at the company. Other companies that pointed to AI in recent restructuring moves were tech consultancy firm Accenture and airline group Lufthansa. \"People don't know where they fit into this new society,\" said Riana Elyse Anderson, a licensed clinical psychologist and associate professor at Columbia University. \"We probably don't even know the full extent of how psychologically damaging this type of replacement is.\" Here's what therapists have to say about workers' artificial intelligence anxiety, and what they may be able to do to feel better. 'Goes deeply into questions of personal value' Losing your job to AI can trigger a host of existential questions, said Ben Yalom, a San Diego-based psychotherapist. \"It may feel as if the universe is saying, 'You are no longer needed,' which may feel much more profound and disturbing than 'Our company is downsizing,' or even 'You are not doing a great job,'\" Yalom said. \"It goes deeply into questions of personal value, which is all very unsettling.\" Underneath these feelings is usually \"a younger part that's terrified of being left behind or not being 'enough,' and that fear gets amplified because the technology itself feels so fast and out of our control,\" Kobil said.

'You are so much more than your work' Workers who know or think they lost their jobs to AI — or are grappling with the changes brought on by the technology — should first \"feel the loss,\" Kobil said. \"Our society is changing quickly,\" Kobil said. \"Allow yourself to grieve and comfort the parts of you that feel shocked, hopeless and afraid right now.\" For decades, studying computer science and learning to code was \"your ticket to success,\" for a \"long, thriving career,\" Anderson said. That may no longer be the case. But the disruptive and uncertain moment can also be a chance for reflection, Anderson said. As an exercise, she recommends pausing any quest to pin down what will lead to a stable, lucrative career, \"because that might not be totally known now.\" Instead, she said, ask yourself: What do you want to do? \"Do some inventory,\" Anderson said. \"Maybe at this time, take stock of who you are.\" Some people may decide to return to school or make a career change, she added. Our society is changing quickly. Emma Kobilpsychotherapist As you ask yourself deeper questions about what you want, try to create some distance between you and your work, Kobil said. \"We all experience huge change,\" Kobil said. \"We all lose our young bodies, for example, but we are not our bodies, just like we are not our ability to write code or manage others. You are so much more than your work.\" Restoring 'a sense of agency'  While the growing role of AI in the workplace can feel overwhelming, \"retreating into avoidance or despair tends to narrow options rather than protect them,\" Lieberman said. \"Learning enough about AI to understand where it genuinely alters work, and where it does not, often restores a sense of agency,\" he said. watch nowThere are plenty of ways to start learning about the technology, including certificate programs and free opportunities, Batchelder said. \"For most workers, understanding the basics of AI will be an asset, especially as we wait to see how the technology advances,\" she said. \"During times of uncertainty, information is always powerful.\" ",

    "body": "watch nowOil prices rose Friday as President Donald Trump's renewed threats against Iran raise concerns about supply disruptions.Iran is not a major oil producer. The country pumps about 3.4 million barrels per day, according to Kpler. That number pales in comparison with the U.S. and Saudi Arabia, which pump about 13.5 million barrels per day and 9.5 million barrels per day, respectively, according to data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration and OPEC.Yet a recent wave of protests in Iran spurred by the plummet in the nation's rial currency and Trump's subsequent suggestions that the U.S. could take military action in the country have rocked energy markets.\"Oil markets are moving on fear,\" Helima Croft, global head of commodity strategy at RBC Capital Markets, told CNBC. \"It's basically a concern about disruption.\"Market anxiety grew Friday as tensions between Iran and the U.S. escalated. \"We're watching Iran,\" Trump told reporters Thursday. \"You know we have a lot of ships going in that direction just in case. We have a big flotilla going in that direction and we'll see what happens.\"Trump's comments come as more than 5,000 people have died in Iran since the protests began on Dec. 28, according to the Human Rights Activists News Agency. \"They were going to hang 837 people,\" Trump said in an interview with CNBC on Wednesday. \"And I told them, you can't do that. If you do that, it's going to be bad.\" While the market is well supplied for the time being, OPEC and its allies, which pump about 40% of the world's oil, hiked their output last year, cutting into spare capacity.\"If we were to get a confrontation between the U.S. and Iran that led to the loss of Iranian oil exports, there just isn't a lot left in the OPEC tank to cover that,\" Croft said. Concerns around a larger regional conflict have also lifted prices given Iran's proximity to some of the world's largest oil producers -- namely Saudi Arabia.\"Iran's location is strategically very important when we think about critical waterways like the Strait of Hormuz, which is a major chokepoint for oil, and we have seen Iran and Iranian-backed groups before target tankers and target critical infrastructure in the Gulf,\" said Croft. In 2019, Iran launched a series of attacks on oil tankers in the Strait of Hormuz. About 20% of global crude flows through the narrow waterway, according to the EIA.Despite pulling back threats of military intervention, Trump confirmed to CNBC on Wednesday that 25% tariffs on countries doing business with Iran are \"going forward.\"Existing sanctions on Iran have already hampered the country's crude exports, with the vast majority going to independent Chinese refiners that buy the oil at a discount to benchmark prices.\"Can you really squeeze Iran much more given where their barrels are going?\" said Croft. \"[Have] sanctions now lost [the] ability to kind of move the needle when it comes to Iranian policy?\"Watch the video above to learn more about Iran's impact on oil markets and what it could mean for consumers.",

    "body": "Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg tries on Orion AR glasses at the Meta Connect annual event at the company's headquarters in Menlo Park, California, U.S., September 25, 2024. REUTERS/Manuel OrbegozoManuel Orbegozo | ReutersMeta's deprioritizing virtual reality in favor of artificial intelligence and Internet-connected smart glasses has chilled the industry, leading to concerns about its future. \"I can see how it feels like a VR winter,\" said Jessica Young, an independent VR content creator specializing in Horizon Worlds, Meta's virtual social network. The social media giant last week laid off 10% of employees who work within its Reality Labs unit, with the cuts centering on VR-related initiatives like the Quest VR headsets, CNBC reported. Teams working on  Horizon Worlds were hit hard and some in-house studios were shuttered. Approximately 1,000 jobs were cut, CNBC reported. The move was part of the company's effort to redirect Reality Labs investments from VR to AI and wearable devices like the Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses that are co-produced with EssilorLuxottica, a spokesperson for the social media company said in a statement last week. Meta declined to comment further beyond its previous statement.Meta's reduced investment in VR is notable considering how much the company has helped grow the industry since its $2 billion acquisition of Oculus in 2014. The company became synonymous with VR when CEO Mark Zuckerberg changed its name from Facebook to Meta, representing the founder's obsession with a future of digital worlds referred to as the metaverse. Since late 2020, Meta's Reality Labs division has logged over $70 billion in cumulative losses.Zuckerberg's sudden reversal has some VR developers worried about their future prospects. While they said they don't see Meta killing its VR efforts, a major shift appears to be underway. Andrew Bosworth, chief technology officer and head of Reality Labs at Meta Platforms Inc., during the Meta Connect event in Menlo Park, California, US, on Thursday, Sept. 18, 2025. David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesMeta traditionally announces new Quest VR headsets during its annual Connect conference in the fall, but in 2025, the company skimped on VR hardware. Instead, Meta introduced its $799 Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses that contain a single, built-in digital screen. \"If Meta's not putting out a new headset for another year or two, it's going to feel stale,\" Young said. \"It already kind of does.\"Since the layoffs, Meta tech chief Andrew Bosworth has been vocal that the social media giant is not abandoning VR.\"We're still continuing to invest heavily in this space, but obviously, VR is growing less quickly than we hoped,\" Bosworth told tech newsletter Sources. \"And so you want to make sure that your investment is right-sized.\"Bosworth this week also circulated a post by Oculus co-founder Palmer Luckey, who on Sunday wrote on X that Meta still employs the \"largest team working on VR by about an order of magnitude.\" Although Luckey said that he feels \"really bad for the people impacted\" by the layoffs, the Reality Labs changes represent \"a good thing thing for the long-term health of the industry, especially the ongoing incentives.\"'The market has spoken'Market research firm IDC said in a December report that a major transition is occurring in the so-called Extended Reality, or XR, device segment. This category includes VR and so-called mixed-reality headsets that allow users to switch between virtual environments and see their surroundings outside the helmet. The category also counts AI-powered smart glasses and more powerful versions with digital displays.IDC projects the XR device category to have grown 41.6% year-over-year to 14.5 million units shipped for 2025. But that growth has nothing to do with VR and mixed-reality headsets — those shipments are expected to drop 42.8% to 3.9 million in 2025. The rest of this XR category, which includes AI glasses with and without displays, is projected to grow 211.2% year-over-year to 10.6 million units shipped for 2025.Jitesh Ubrani, a research manager for market analyst firm IDC, characterized the VR headset market as niche and appealing to only a small segment of video gamers. Average consumers seem uninterested in wearing \"big, bulky headsets\" for lengthy VR sessions like much of the tech industry hoped for roughly a decade ago, he said.\"The market has spoken,\" Ubrani said. \"There are certain niche audiences that will continue to use these headsets, but it's not going to be broadly appealing.\"Visitors experience the new AR+AI glasses flagship product at the XREAL booth at WAIC 2025 in Shanghai, China, on July 27, 2025. Costfoto | Nurphoto | Getty ImagesAndrew Eiche, the CEO of the Google-owned VR gaming studio Owlchemy Labs, said it was always misguided to think VR was on the cusp of having its breakthrough smartphone moment. He called it a \"strategic mistake\" to compare VR headsets to iPhones The VR market, Eiche said, more closely resembles old-school Atari video game consoles that were popular before sales crashed during an infamous 1983 gaming market meltdown. It wasn't until the late 1980s that Nintendo consoles helped revive the market, laying the groundwork for the overall industry to balloon to the massive sector it is today.\"Lot of tech people thought [VR] was going to be instantly amazing, and the same thing's happening with AI,\" Eiche said about the tech industry's pivot to the latest craze. \"When you're looking at long-term technologies, VR is not going anywhere.\"Still, Eiche said that beyond Meta's layoffs, other VR studios have also recently downsized as part of a broader video game industry slump. Because Quest is the dominant VR headset on the market, its app store is a key distribution channel for third-party VR.Making matters worse, Eiche said that Meta's Horizon Worlds push came at the expense of third-party developers who were trying to find visibility among Quest users.\"We're at the mercy of Meta,\" Eiche said, adding that it \"creates a situation where if Meta pulls back, we all pull back.\" Eiche said he's optimistic that the upcoming Steam Frame wireless VR headset from gaming company Valve will help the market, as well as the recent entries of other devices like the Samsung Galaxy XR, which debuted in October, and Apple's Vision Pro. But Apple's entry into the VR space in February 2024 hasn't done much to move the needle, and in January, IDC said that Apple's Chinese manufacturing partner Luxshare stopped producing new Vision Pro headsets, signaling a lack of widespread consumer demand. Still, Ubrani said that Apple's $3,499 spatial computing headset has found some footing as a business tool.\"Apple did do well in selling to a lot of developers, but they also sold into some very big companies,\" Ubrani said.watch nowVR's hope shifts to the enterprise market\"There were certain quarters where Apple beat Meta in enterprise,\" Ubrani said, due in part to the iPhone-maker's experience selling devices to businesses. The enterprise VR market may not be as glamorous as its consumer counterpart, but it represents an area where IDC has \"seen slow but upwards movement, because companies are realizing that there is great ROI attached with deploying these headsets.\"As part of Meta's Reality Labs cuts, the company said in a support page that it would end its Horizon managed services program that was for businesses that used Quest headsets for internal tasks like virtual employee trainings.Meta failed to realize \"how big VR could be if they adopted the bigger picture outside of gaming,\" said Sean Mann, CEO of the startup RP1, which develops a \"metaverse browser\" for people to access virtual and augmented reality environments. As Meta downsizes its VR ambitions and steers Horizon Worlds to be a mobile-focused online gaming platform like Roblox, Young said she plans to keep creating experiences on the platform. Young has been able to make a living by getting paid by other Horizon developers to create trailers to promote experiences available to users on the service. She's also earned money from Meta by winning Horizon-related competitions intended to help improve the overall platform.But Young said she's less enthusiastic about Horizon's mobile push, because there was something special about the platform during its earlier, VR-centric years, particularly during the Covid era. \"Horizon became a lifeline for people isolated by the pandemic, disability, age or geography,\" she said. \"Many users who never imagined themselves as creators, who had no background in art or programming, were inspired by their friends to try.\"But Horizon lost is way, and \"what's frustrating now is watching people declare it dead without ever having experienced or understanding what it was,\" Young said.

    "body": "Delroy Lindo, finally an Academy Award-nominated actor, only had to wait five decades to earn the honor — overcoming \"strategic missteps\" that once threatened to derail his career along the way, he's said.Lindo, 73, is a longtime character actor whose appearances on film, television and stage have earned him critical acclaim, even as his industry's highest honors eluded him. On Thursday, Lindo earned his first Oscar nomination, in the Best Supporting Actor category, for his work in the 2025 blockbuster \"Sinners.\" The nomination comes five years after some of the actor's supporters complained that he'd been \"snubbed\" by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences for his work in the Spike Lee film \"Da 5 Bloods.\"Lindo was \"profoundly disappointed\" by getting shut out of the 2021 Oscar nominations for that role, he told Entertainment Weekly on Thursday. Lee, an Oscar-winner himself, also expressed disappointment over Lindo's lack of awards recognition, commenting in March 2021 on Instagram that it \"does not take away from the impact of his work that spans decades.\"Before his Oscars nomination, the actor had a long, well-respected career that included acclaimed performances in notable films such as \"The Cider House Rules\" and the Lee-directed \"Malcolm X\" and \"Crooklyn.\" Still, Lindo has lamented his career floundering for multiple years in the mid-1990s as he developed a reputation as being a \"difficult\" actor to work with, he's said.\"I made some strategic missteps. One of the biggest missteps was probably thinking that I was important,\" Lindo told The Hollywood Reporter in March 2021, discussing why high-profile roles \"dried up\" for him nearly three decades ago. He'd bring passion and intensity to his work, occasionally leading him to butt heads with directors when their creative visions didn't fully align, he said.At one point, Lindo walked away from a Lee-produced film over concerns about the script, leading to a nearly 25-year pause between collaborations for the actor and director, Lindo told GQ in April 2021. He might've walked away from acting altogether if fellow actor Denzel Washington hadn't talked him out of the idea, telling Lindo he was \"too good\" an actor to quit, Lindo said at a \"Sinners\" screening in December 2025, according to Deadline.\"That period had to do with these various missteps that I made, which resulted in perhaps being seen as less viable as a film actor, less desirable,\" Lindo told GQ. \"Was that frustrating and painful? Absolutely. I was playing catch-up.\"Ultimately, Lindo came to the realization that he needed to adjust his approach to collaboration, rather than hoping his acting talent would be enough to keep landing him high-profile work, he told THR.\"I thought it was a meritocracy, that good work would beget more good work. No, not quite,\" said Lindo. \"I also was not as strategic or as diplomatic as I could have been in certain situations. I needed to communicate in a way that could not be perceived as either ungrateful or bigheaded.\"Communication expert: 'Don't think of them as conflict conversations'Effective communication is a key skill that can make or break anyone's career, some experts say. Mastering the art of having tough conversations at work — like raising a constructive criticism with a colleague or respectfully disagreeing with your boss — can help you get ahead in your career without alienating others, workplace expert Henna Pryor told CNBC Make It on Aug. 21.Try reframing those conversations as opportunities to seek clarity, rather than as confrontations, Pryor recommended. \"So much comes down to how we prime and frame [conversations],\" she said. \"I don't think of them as conflict conversations. I think of them as clarify conversations. I am seeking clarity about an issue, about why we're disagreeing.\"Lindo didn't specify exactly how he's adapted his approach to be more diplomatic when expressing his creative opinions at work, but he's returned to landing notable acting roles. In addition to his roles in \"Da 5 Bloods\" and \"Sinners,\" Lindo also landed a recurring role on the Emmy Award-nominated Paramount+ series \"The Good Fight\" between 2017 and 2021.Now, Lindo is up for an award that many actors spend their entire lives and careers chasing. After enduring the ups and downs of his own career, Lindo says he's still letting the honor sink in.\"It feels terrific,\" Lindo said on ABC's \"Good Morning America\" on Friday. \"I'm still processing, if I'm really honest, but it's wonderful.\"Want to get ahead at work with AI?

    "body": "Employees stand near an The Amazon Inc. logo is displayed above the reception counter at the company's campus in Hyderabad, India, on Friday, Sept. 6, 2019.Bloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesAmazon on Wednesday committed to investing over $35 billion in India's cloud and artificial intelligence space by 2030, as hyperscalers race to get a foothold in the market. The commitment, unveiled at the Amazon Smbhav Summit in New Delhi, builds on nearly $40 billion already invested in the country. In a press release, Amazon said the new funds will target AI-driven digitization, export growth and job creation, aligning with India's national priorities to build up its local AI environment.By 2030, Amazon said the plan is expected to generate an additional 1 million direct, indirect, induced and seasonal jobs in India, quadruple exports to $80 billion and deliver AI benefits to 15 million small businesses.India is one of the fastest‑growing regions for AI spending within Asia Pacific, Deepika Giri, IDC's regional head of research for big data & AI, told CNBC.\"A major gap, and therefore a significant opportunity, lies in the shortage of suitable compute infrastructure for running AI models,\" Giri said.She added that countries across Asia are accelerating efforts to build sovereign AI capabilities as the technology becomes more regionalized due to trade tensions and tariffs, with infrastructure as a central pillar of those strategies.The investment highlights Amazon's bet on India's booming digital economy, where it has been building fulfillment centers, data centers and payments infrastructure. It also comes soon after Microsoft announced plans to invest $17.5 billion in India's AI infrastructure as Big Tech players accelerate their push into the market. \"We are humbled to have been a part of India's digital transformation journey over the past 15 years,\" said Amit Agarwal, senior vice president for emerging markets at Amazon. \"Looking ahead, we're excited to continue being a catalyst for India's growth, as we democratize access to AI for millions of Indians.\"",

    "body": "Indonesia and United States flags together realtions textile cloth fabric textureOleksii Liskonih | Istock | Getty ImagesThe trade deal between Indonesia and the U.S. is at risk of unravelling as Washington officials view that Jakarta is going back on the terms of the agreement, according to The Financial Times. The report, citing people familiar with matter, said on Tuesday that U.S. trade representative Jamieson Greer believes Indonesia was \"backtracking\" on several commitments it had made.Indonesian officials reportedly are averse to agreeing to some binding commitments made in the deal and have communicated that to the USTR. Washington believes Indonesia is \"backsliding\" on removing non-tariff barriers to U.S. industrial and agricultural exports as well as its pledges on taking action on digital trade issues. Reuters reported on Wednesday that an Indonesian official told the agency that tariff negotiations were ongoing, with no specific issues have arisen during the talks.U.S. President Donald Trump U.S. had announced a deal with Indonesia in mid-July, slashing so-called \"reciprocal\" tariff rate on the Southeast Asian country to 19% from the 32% he had threatened in his \"tariff letter\" to the country earlier that month. Trump had said that Indonesia had \"committed\" to purchasing $15 billion of U.S. Energy, $4.5 billion in American agricultural products, and 50 Boeing jets as part of the deal.The U.S. president also said at the time that \"U.S. Exports to Indonesia are to be Tariff and Non Tariff Barrier FREE.\"The USTR and Indonesia's trade ministry did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comments. Deal frictionsA person familiar with the matter told the FT that Indonesia was \"outright saying they cannot implement what they agreed to and need to renegotiate the initial commitments to be nonbinding,\" adding that the stance was \"extremely problematic and is not being well-received from the United States. Indonesia may be at risk of losing its deal.\"This is not the first time that Washington and Jakarta are seeing some friction over a trade deal. In November, the FT reported that Indonesia had rejected a \"poison pill\" clause in its deal that other Southeast Asian economies such as Malaysia had agreed.The \"poison pill\" clause threatens to revoke a trade agreement if the country signs any rival deal that the U.S. considers will compromise its key interests. Trump's trade deals with Asian countries have seen other economies in the region also push back, after these initial agreements were announced. For example, Trump had said that South Korea would invest $350 billion in the country, but Seoul said that it could not simply hand over the amount in cash. South Korea eventually committed to investing $200 billion in cash over 10 years and a $150 billion fund to be spent on investments in shipbuilding.Trump had also announced that Japan would invest $550 billion in the country, with the U.S. taking 90% of the profit from these investments. However, Tokyo later said that the profits would be split between Japan and the U.S., according to the degree of contributions by each side.",

    "body": "New research shows men and women are equally committed to doing their best at work, but there's a growing ambition gap among women who want to get ahead — and companies rolling back commitments to women's career advancement, sponsorship and stretch opportunities could be to blame.That's according to Lean In and McKinsey & Company's latest Women in the Workplace report, now in its 11th year, which looked at data from 124 U.S. and Canadian companies as well as 9,500 employees to assess talent pipeline data, employee experience surveys, and HR programs and policies. The survey found that 80% of women overall say they want to be promoted to the next level, compared to 86% of men.The ambition gap is highest at the entry level, where just 69% of early-career women want a promotion vs. 80% of their male peers, and at the senior level, where 84% of women want to be promoted vs. 92% of their male colleagues.Stephen Lazina | CNBCIt's part of a larger and \"concerning\" trend of companies rolling back their commitments to women's career advancement at work, says Rachel Thomas, CEO and co-founder of Lean In.\"Only half of companies remain committed to women's career advancement,\" Thomas tells CNBC Make It, citing the report's data. \"Our sense is [women] are feeling that. How couldn't they be?\"Despite the first-time ambition gap, it disappears among women who reported having the same levels of career support, sponsorship and stretch opportunities as their male peers, from entry- to senior-level employees, says Megan McConnell, a partner at McKinsey.Entry-level women face a broken rung to advance early onHistorically, entry-level women under 30 have been among the most ambitious workers who want to be promoted and aspire to be senior leaders, even more so than men under 30, Thomas says. But they also go \"overlooked\" in being supported to go after new opportunities, especially to become first-time managers, which can delay career advancement for years down the line.Only one-third of all entry-level people managers are women, according to the report, and just 31% of entry-level women have a sponsor compared with 45% of entry-level men.Stephen Lazina | CNBC\"Sponsorship is one of the biggest drivers of advancement and also feeling confident and supported at work,\" Thomas says. \"In this year's Women in the Workplace study, employees that have sponsors are twice as likely to get promoted.\"With less support, \"it's hard to imagine that just doesn't impact your optimism, and may actually directly impact how ambitious you feel,\" Thomas says.Support to learn AI and flexibility bias play a roleYoung professional women also receive less support from their manager to use AI at work, which matters when early adopters are rewarded and promoted.\"We know that AI is going to be challenging for jobs, and it's going be the most challenging for the people that don't know how to use those tools,\" Lean In founder and former Meta chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg told CNBC's Julia Boorstin in an interview Tuesday.Encouraging more men than women to use AI early in their careers could exacerbate the broken rung for young professionals. \"We are going to see disproportionate impacts,\" Sandberg said, \"and that would be a real shame for our companies [and] bad for our economy.\"Young women are also more likely to be held back in their careers by the flexibility bias, according to the report: Entry-level women are more likely than men to work remotely offsite, and when they do, their promotion rates lag behind their male counterparts, who are promoted at similar rates regardless of whether they work in an office or remotely.Stephen Lazina | CNBCSenior-level women see a steeper path to the topA lack of support for women's advancement early on can have a compounding effect over time. Senior-level women who say they don't want a promotion are more likely than men to say it's because they've been passed over for a promotion in the past, and they don't see a realistic path to the top.These factors can make it feel like career advancement is out of reach, and so they're less likely to go after it.Other women may be opting out because the higher-level job doesn't offer them the professional development they want or the flexibility they need.Senior-level women are \"significantly more likely to think employees who are more senior than them are burned out or unhappy,\" Thomas says. These women \"see a steeper and less attractive path to the top.\"Women's personal obligations, including shouldering the burden of household and care-giving responsibilities, could play a role in their opting out of promotions. Almost 25% of entry- and senior-level women who don't want a promotion say it's because personal responsibilities make it hard to take on added work, compared to 15% of men at these levels.But it doesn't tell the full story: \"Women who are mothers are just as ambitious as women who are not mothers,\" Thomas says. \"So although it's a factor, I don't think it's the main driver. I think it's much more about what's happening in our culture right now, and I think it's much more about a lack of support from companies.\"When women have career support, they want to advance at workA majority of companies reported that they're prioritizing inclusive cultures (88%) and diversity (67%) this year, according to the survey. But just about half, 54%, say they're committed to programs that support women's career advancement. That falls to just 48% of companies when considering women of color's advancement at work.\"Companies are rolling back programs that we know are particularly beneficial to women,\" Thomas says, including flexible and remote work, formal sponsorship programs, and career development programs with content tailored toward women.While these programs are especially beneficial to women, they also create a more inclusive culture to those who make use of these programs or learn how to work better with others through them, Thomas adds.Effective career support can be as straightforward as having a conversation with your manager about your career aspirations, as well as being put up for promotions or special projects that give you new skills and visibility to senior leaders in the company, McConnell says.One troubling factor could be a continued flattening of middle management, which can have three big impacts. First, managers are now overseeing more reports, which could mean less time and energy in helping women's career advancement. Meanwhile, women may see fewer opportunities to move into middle management, and if they exist, women may not see those leadership positions as attractive given the strain of managing more people with fewer resources.\"Women should always be able to choose the path that makes the most sense to them,\" Thomas says. \"But I don't want it to be because companies are not doing what they should be to support women at all levels, and particularly entry-level women.\"Want to give your kids the ultimate advantage? You teach them to read and ride a bike, but often skip money management.

    "body": "People walk along the Huguosi street, Xicheng district, a dedicated food street in Beijing on August 23, 2024. Adek Berry | AFP | Getty ImagesChina's consumer inflation climbed in November to hit its highest level in nearly two years, while producer price deflation deepened, underscoring the challenge policymakers face in reviving domestic demand amid persistent trade tensions.Consumer prices edged up 0.7% from a year earlier, its highest level since February last year, National Bureau of Statistics data showed Wednesday. The increase followed a 0.2% rise in October and matched the 0.7% gain expected in a Reuters poll of economists. Factory-gate prices fell 2.2% in November from a year earlier, largely because of a higher comparison base, missing the forecast of a 2% decline and extending the deflationary stretch into its fourth year The decline followed a 2.1% fall in October. Core inflation, which excludes volatile prices of food and energy, was up 1.2% year-on-year in November, unchanged from the rise in the prior month. Dong Lijuan, chief statistician at NBS, attributed the improvement in CPI to higher food prices, which grew 0.2% from a year earlier, reversing a 2.9% drop in October. Energy prices slid 3.4% from a year earlier, a sharper decline than the previous month. Beijing's consumption-focused stimulus measures continued to lift prices for home appliances and clothes, which rose 4.9% and 2%, respectively. Prices for gasoline-powered and new-energy vehicles fell by 2.5% and 2.4%, respectively. Gold accessories prices rose 58.4% from a year earlier.    Despite the pickup in consumer prices, economists warned that deflationary pressure remains entrenched in China's economy. The headline CPI was largely supported by higher prices of fresh vegetables amid a supply shortage due to adverse weather, according to Goldman Sachs, while the core inflation figure was helped by the surging gold prices.   The Wall Street bank estimates that core CPI inflation, excluding gold prices, \"edged down modestly\" from October to November. On a monthly basis, CPI slipped 0.1%, below the anticipated 0.2% gain in a Reuters poll, as prices for hotels, flights, transportation, and travel agencies cooled after the extended holiday period in October.  Among the categories that posted the sharpest drops in factory-gate prices, the coal mining and washing industry saw prices fall 11.8% from a year ago, while the oil and gas extraction sector recorded a 10.3% decline.  Growth faltersChina has struggled to shake off the deflationary pressure since the end of the pandemic, as a protracted housing downturn and weak labour market conditions continue to weigh on household spending. Excess production in several sectors has also led to oversupply, forcing firms to cut prices to stay competitive.  \"Manufacturers are still cutting prices to shift excess supply, and that persistent decline highlights how weak demand conditions remain,\" said Zavier Wong, a market analyst at stock trading platform eToro.  \"Until demand strengthens more broadly and price pressures become more balanced, China's recovery will continue to feel uneven, even if the headline numbers appear to be improving,\" Wong added. watch nowWhile economic growth slowed to its weakest pace in a year in the third quarter, China appears to be on track to reach its annual growth target of \"around 5%\" this year, supported by the resilient exports as manufacturers ramped up shipments to non-U.S. markets.  China recorded more than $1 trillion in trade surplus in the first 11 months of the year, topping the full-year record set in 2024, as the country navigated ongoing trade tensions and growing economic protectionism worldwide.   In a key meeting earlier this month, the Politburo, top decision-making body of the ruling Communist Party, named expanding domestic demand and rebalancing supplies among the top economic priorities for 2026.  \"Although policymakers maintained their easing bias, they appeared less inclined towards broad-based stimulus measures,\" said Lisheng Wang, China economist at Goldman Sachs, noting that policymakers may need to strengthen their easing rhetoric again and step up pro-growth policy efforts next year to offset the drag from the property sector and labour market.  Investors and economists are watching closely the annual Central Economic Work Conference expected in the coming days, where policymakers will set key growth targets and policy priorities for next year. The official figures will not be made public until the annual parliamentary meeting in March.  ",

That's sooner than many advocates and borrowers may have expected: President Donald Trump's \"big beautiful bill\" set the SAVE program's expiration date at July 1, 2028.In their lawsuits, the GOP states had argued that Biden, with SAVE, was trying to find a roundabout way to forgive student debt after the Supreme Court blocked his sweeping debt cancellation plan in June 2023. SAVE came with two key provisions that the lawsuits targeted: it had lower monthly payments than any other federal student loan repayment plan, and it led to quicker debt erasure for those with small balances.The proposed settlement comes four months after the Education Department resumed charging interest on the loans of borrowers who remained in the SAVE forbearance.Consumer advocates slammed the agreement. Persis Yu, deputy executive director and managing counsel at Protect Borrowers, said it would \"strip borrowers of the most affordable repayment plan.\"More than 42 million Americans hold student loans and the outstanding debt exceeds $1.6 trillion, according to the Congressional Research Service. How will the end of the SAVE forbearance impact you?

    "body": "Target has turned its store in New York City's SoHo neighborhood into a unique concept store. Inside of an area that resembles the company's Bullseye logo, the company has \"The Drop,\" a rotating display of seasonal styles and curated items.Courtesy of TargetIn one of New York City's most fashion-forward neighborhoods, Target is unveiling its latest effort to keep up with trends and lead the way on style. The Minneapolis-based retailer, which is in the middle of a turnaround effort and on the cusp of a CEO change, gave a makeover to its big-box store in SoHo at 600 Broadway.The one-of-a-kind concept store, which opens Tuesday, will have rotating merchandise, curated displays chosen by celebrities and influencers, and other kinds of special programming, Chief Guest Experience Officer Cara Sylvester said.The SoHo store is part of a broader push by incoming CEO Michael Fiddelke to win back Target's reputation for style and sharp merchandise. When he was named Target's next leader in August, he said that would be one of his top three priorities, along with improving the customer experience and rolling out technology to make Target faster and more efficient. He will start the role in February, succeeding longtime CEO Brian Cornell.Target is trying to get back to growth after roughly four years of stagnant annual sales due to self-inflicted challenges and a more difficult economic backdrop. Store foot traffic and sales have fallen as shoppers have responded to sloppier stores, out-of-stock and locked-up items, and the company's decision to roll back key diversity, equity and inclusion programs. Consumers across the country have also become more selective about buying discretionary merchandise, which has long been Target's sweet spot, as they pay more for necessities like groceries, electricity and housing.At an event previewing the store on Monday night, Fiddelke described the SoHo location as \"a punctuation point\" for Target's sense of style and its plans for the future. In an interview with CNBC, Sylvester said the store's merchandise has completely changed. The location, which opened about seven years ago, drew many shoppers and had strong sales, but sold mostly items found in drug and convenience stores, she said. It didn't carry any of Target's clothing or home decor, which felt both out of step with the neighborhood and like a missed opportunity for Target, she said.\"We said, 'This is the style and fashion capital. We have to be able to showcase the best,'\" she said, recalling the inspiration for the project.Read moreFrom start to finish, the store's redesign took four months as the company raced to get the project done ahead of the holidays, Sylvester said. It has redone the store's first floor and plans to redesign the basement floor in the coming year, she added.The SoHo store is reopening at a time when holiday shoppers and tourists flock to the major shopping district for holiday gifts and party outfits — and as Target chases sales across the country during the critical shopping season. It is one of 42 stores that the retailer has in New York City and nearly 2,000 that is has in the U.S.\"The world looks at New York to see what's new and what's next,\" Sylvester said in remarks at the launch event. \"And we want them to look at Target when they see what's new and what's next.\"A look inside Target's SoHo storeInside of a merchandise area that resembles Target's Bullseye logo, the store will have rotating merchandise that's organized around a theme.Melissa Repko, CNBCWhen customers step inside of Target's SoHo store, they will enter a long, red hallway that resembles the inside of Target's Bullseye logo. The area of the store is called \"The Drop,\" and Target will display merchandise there chosen around themes that feel relevant for the time of year, Sylvester said. Like most of the store, the rotating area will swap out about every four to six weeks, she added.As the store opens, The Drop is themed around the holidays — including outfits and items that a shopper may need for going out, lounging at home or giving a gift to a party host. The store displays range across categories, mixing in clothing, home decor, beauty items and more. For example, The Drop currently includes a table of products that a shopper might want if they're hosting a night at home with friends, such as card games, an espresso martini mix and eye-catching glassware for the cocktails.Sylvester said the company's merchants are already working on the next two themes for The Drop, which will be focused on wellness in January, the season of New Year's resolutions, and Valentine's Day in February.Target's SoHo store has an eye-catching \"Beauty Bar\" that shows off fragrances, makeup items and more.Courtesy of TargetCustomers can step inside of Target's \"Broadway Beauty Bar,\" which is designed for selfies and social media posts. It will have a rotating assortment of Target's beauty merchandise, including fragrance brands like Fine'ry that are exclusive to Target, and trendy mini versions of face washes, lip glosses and more from national brands.At launch, Target is featuring items chosen by celebrity makeup artist Katie Jane Hughes. Along with the \"Beauty Bar,\" the store sells items typically found at the big-box retailer, including large shampoos, body washes and cotton balls.Near the beauty area, shoppers can also press a button and snap a black-and-white selfie.Though the store's layout is new, it shares a similarity with some of Target's other New York City locations — some items are locked behind glasses cases that an employee needs to open.Target will tap celebrities and influencers to pick their favorite Target items for its \"Curated By\" display.Courtesy of TargetIn the back of the store's first floor, Target will have a rotating \"Curated By\" display of items from across the retailer's beauty, fashion and home categories, picked by celebrities and other creators known for their sense of style. Shoppers can browse and buy that person's favorites or scan a QR code to see a list of them.Target's first Curated By features favorites from Megan Stalter, an actress and comedian who is in HBO's \"Hacks.\" Some of her picks include a throw pillow, a pair of hot pink slippers, metallic water bottles and Universal's \"Wicked: For Good\" movie-themed clothing items.Inside of the \"Gifting Gondola,\" Target will show off exclusive merchandise like plushes from its toy brand, Gigglescape, and items themed around its dog mascot, Bullseye, such as special edition Haribo candies.Courtesy of TargetAlso at the store, shoppers can find Target's \"Gifting Gondola,\" which features merchandise exclusive to Target. Currently, the display includes holiday-themed plush penguins, bears and other products from Target's toy brand, Gigglescape. It also includes some giftable items themed around the retailer's bull terrier, Bullseye, including special edition Haribo gummy candies and a Bullseye Pez dispenser.Over time, Sylvester said Target may introduce some items that are unique to the SoHo store and can only be bought there.

    "body": "Unmanned trucks transport containers at Dapukou Container Terminal in Zhoushan Port, Ningbo, Zhejiang, China, on December 9, 2025. Nurphoto | Nurphoto | Getty ImagesBEIJING — Supply chain diversification away from China is about to move from just talk to action.That's what Jens Eskelund, president, European Union Chamber of Commerce in China, told reporters on Tuesday ahead of the launch of a report on supply chain risks, and as businesses look ahead to the new year after a tumultuous 2025.\"Dependencies are being discussed in much more detail than they were before ... Are we even sure Europe can manufacture toothpaste without ingredients sourced in China?\" Eskelund said.Reflecting continued global demand, China's trade surplus for the year through November reached a record $1 trillion, according to official figures released Monday. That means the country exported far more than it imported, despite U.S. tariffs.\"The higher that production goes up, the higher the risk that countries will begin to react,\" Eskelund said. He pointed out China faced a record high of 198 World Trade Organization trade investigations last year, well over half of which were from developing countries. Other figures cited by the EU Chamber in its report Wednesday showed that China's share in containers shipped globally was creeping up — at 37% for the first three quarters of this year, up from 36% at the end of 2024 and 31.7% before the pandemic in 2019.A weak Chinese currency and domestic overproduction contributed to that growth, the chamber said. It recommended members \"eliminate single-source dependencies\" on the U.S. and China, and called on EU policymakers to \"accelerate plans to identify and eliminate critical dependencies.\" watch nowInvestors have heard this conversation before. During Covid-19, businesses started to realize how reliant they were on products and parts from China,  when stringent lockdowns to control the virus disrupted production. The stakes for businesses and their home base governments are far higher now compared to the pandemic, Eskelund said.\"That's actually a big shift, from you're concerned primarily about whether you have a supply chain that can physically deliver the product, and then whether your supply chain is dependent on a certain government position,\" he said. As tensions between the U.S. and Beijing rose over tariffs and trade barriers this year, Beijing ramped up export controls, including on critical rare earths, bringing into light the global dependency on Chinese production.  A survey by the American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai earlier this year found that a record share of respondents — 47% — had diverted investments planned for China.At the start of the year, the EU Chamber's member survey found that business sentiment was at a record low, with a record 73% of respondents saying doing business in the Asian country had become more difficult.Still, more than a quarter of the respondents said they were increasing onshoring in China, largely to meet Beijing's localization requirements, with just 10% looking at supply chains outside China — that is changing now.In November, the chamber conducted a brief survey of 131 members about the impact of China's export controls and found that about a third of the respondents planned to look outside China for supplies or developing capacity outside the country.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tWeekly analysis and insights from Asia's largest economy in your inbox\n\t\t\tSubscribe now\n\t\t\n\tIt's less clear whether diversification means reshoring.\"The reality is nobody is reshoring it's all friendshoring,\" said Cameron Johnson, Shanghai-based senior partner at consulting firm Tidalwave Solutions. \"They're going to Mexico, they're going to Southeast Asia.\"\"You should expect Chinese supply chains to become more dominant,\" he said, adding that companies will try to better map out their entire supply chain, rather than just focusing on specific parts. Chinese firms might be the ones partnering with those overseas factories, or setting them up. The EU trade body said that about half of its members reported their China-based suppliers were now shifting production to other markets. Eskelund pointed out that car companies from different countries, increasingly including China, have taken this approach. \"Here Chinese companies might be a little ahead of their own government,\" he said.

    "body": "Park Dae-jun, CEO of South Korean online retail giant Coupang has resigned, three weeks after the company became aware of a massive data breach that affected nearly 34 million customers.CoupangThe CEO of South Korean online retail giant Coupang Corp. resigned Wednesday, three weeks after the company became aware of a massive data breach that affected nearly 34 million customers.Coupang said CEO Park Dae-jun resigned due to the data breach incident — which was revealed on Nov. 18 —  according to a Google translation of the statement in Korean.\"I am deeply sorry for disappointing the public with the recent personal information incident,\" Park said, adding, \"I feel a deep sense of responsibility for the outbreak and the subsequent recovery process, and I have decided to step down from all positions.\"Following his resignation, parent company Coupang Inc. appointed Harold Rogers, the Chief Administrative Officer and General Counsel, as interim CEO. Coupang said that Rogers plans to \"focus on alleviating customer anxiety caused by the personal information leak\" and to stabilize the organisation. Park, who joined the company in 2012, became Coupang's sole CEO in May, after the company transitioned away from a dual-CEO system.According to Coupang, he was responsible for the company's innovative new business and regional infrastructure development, and led projects to expand sales channels for small and medium enterprises, among others. South Korean companies are known for being \"very, very cost-efficient,\" which may have led to neglecting areas like cybersecurity, Peter Kim, managing director at KB Securities, told CNBC's \"Squawk Box Asia\" Wednesday.\"I think the core issue here is that we've had a number of other breaches, not just Coupang, but previously, telecom companies in Korea,\" Kim added. \"I understand some data companies consider Korea to be [the] top three or four most breached on a data, on an IT security basis in the world.\"watch nowSouth Korean companies have been hit by cybersecurity breaches before, including an April incident at mobile carrier SK Telecom that affected 23.24 million people. The country previously saw one of its largest cybersecurity incidents in 2011, when attackers stole over 35 million user details from internet platforms Nate and Cyworld.Nate is one of the most popular search engines in South Korea, while Cyworld was one of the country's largest social networking sites in the early 2000s. Prime Minister Kim Min-seok reportedly said Wednesday that strict action would be taken against the company if violations of the law were found, according to South Korean media outlet Yonhap. Police also raided the Coupang headquarters for a second day on Wednesday, continuing their investigation into the data breach. Yonhap also reported, citing sources, that the police search warrant \"specifies a Chinese national who formerly worked for Coupang as a suspect on charges of breaching the information and communications network and leaking confidential data.\"Last week, South Korean President Lee Jae Myung called for increased penalties on data breaches, saying that the Coupang data breach had served as a wake-up call.— CNBC's Chery Kang contributed to this report.watch now",

    "body": "watch nowThe Federal Reserve is poised to deliver its third straight interest rate cut Wednesday, while simultaneously firing a warning shot about what's ahead.Following a period of remarkable indecision about which way central bank policymakers would lean, markets have settled on a quarter percentage point reduction. If that's the case, it will take the Fed's key interest rate down to a range of 3.5%-3.75%.However, there are complications.The rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee is split between members who favor cuts as a way to head off further weakness in the labor market against those who think easing has gone far enough and threatens to aggravate inflation.That's why the term \"hawkish cut\" has become the buzzy term for this meeting. In market parlance, it refers to a Fed that will reduce, but deliver a message that no one should be holding their breath for the next one.\"The likeliest outcome is a kind of hawkish cut where they cut, but the statement and the press conference suggesting that they may be done cutting for now,\" said Bill English, the Fed's former director of monetary affairs and now a Yale professor. English expects the message to be \"that they've made an adjustment and they're comfortable where they are, and they don't see a need to do anything more in the near term, as long as things play out more or less as they expect.\"Where the full committee falls will be expressed in the post-meeting statement and Chair Jerome Powell's news conference. Wall Street economic commentary anticipates a tweak in the statement to harken back to a year ago with language regarding \"the extent and timing of additional adjustments\" that Goldman Sachs expects to reflect \"the bar for any further cuts will be somewhat higher.\"In addition to the rate decision and the statement, investors will be watching an update to the \"dot plot\" of individual officials' rate expectations; expectations for gross domestic product, unemployment and inflation, and a possible update of the Fed's asset purchase intentions, with some expecting the committee to pivot from ceasing the runoff of maturing bond proceeds back to purchases.Many moving partsAs for Powell, his tone \"will also likely get across that the bar has risen in his press conference and will likely again make a point of explaining the views of participants who opposed a cut,\" Goldman economist David Mericle said in a note.About that dissent: The October meeting saw two \"no\" votes on the final statement, one from each side of the rate debate. Mericle said that is likely to happen again, accompanied by multiple other \"soft dissents\" who will represent divergent views on the \"dot plot\" that indicates, anonymously, the rate outlook for each of 19 individual meeting participants, a group that includes 12 voters.While Mericle added that there is a \"solid case\" for a third cut, there are arguments to be made for both sides.\"It's a tough meeting, and so they'll presumably be a few dissents,\" English said. \"It's often hard to get the committee together. You have people who just have very different views about how the economy works and how policy works and so on. But this moment for the economy is particularly fraught.\"Even with the dearth of official government data due to the since-settled shutdown, hiring has shown signs of flattening, with sporadic signals that layoffs are accelerating. A Bureau of Labor Statistics report Tuesday showed job openings little changed in October but hiring down by 218,000 and layoffs rising by 73,000.On the inflation side, the most recent reading of the Fed's preferred gauge showed the annual rate at 2.8% in September, slightly below the Wall Street forecast but still well above the central bank's 2% goal.Inflation worriesDespite President Donald Trump's protestations that inflation has disappeared, it has at best stabilized and at worst is holding above the Fed's target in part due to the tariffs implemented under his watch. While Fed officials mostly have said they expect the duties to provide a temporary boost to prices,  the gap between the current level and the central bank goal is enough to give some economists and policymakers pause.\"Inflation is not back to 2% so they're going to need to keep policy somewhat restrictive if they are going to put downward pressure on inflation,\" former Cleveland President Loretta Mester said Tuesday on CNBC. \"Right now, inflation is pretty well above the goal, and it's not just all tariff-driven.\"Still, Mester thinks the FOMC will approve one more cut Wednesday. Like market participants, Mester saw a Nov. 21 speech from New York Fed President John Williams as the pivotal sign \"quite clearly\" that another reduction was coming. Prior to that, markets had been betting against a cut, particularly after Powell said explicitly at his October news conference that a December move was not a \"foregone conclusion. Far from it.\"\"I think they're going to follow through with that last cut,\" Mester said. \"I do hope that they signal that they think the economy has gotten to a place where policy is in a good place and they are going to slow down the cuts, because I am more concerned about the inflation risk, the stickiness.\"Aside from rate questions and the dot plot update, the committee may signal its next step regarding management of its balance sheet.The committee in October signaled that it would halt the process of \"quantitative tightening,\" or allowing maturing bond proceeds to roll off. With pressures ongoing in the overnight funding markets, some market participants expect the Fed will announce it will resume bond purchases, though not a pace that would suggest the \"quantitative easing,\" or QT's opposite.",

    "body": "Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, right, speaks alongside President Donald Trump about investing in America, at the White House in Washington, on April 30, 2025.Jim Watson | AFP | Getty ImagesPresident Donald Trump's decision to let U.S. tech giant Nvidia sell more advanced semiconductors to China is getting pushback from some Republicans wary of giving Beijing an edge in the global race to AI dominance.The agreement, which Trump announced in a Truth Social post Monday evening, would allow Nvidia to sell its H200 artificial intelligence chips to China on the condition that the U.S. government gets 25% of the sales.The H200 chips aren't Nvidia's most advanced, but are more powerful than the company's H20s, which were previously developed specifically for the China market.The White House, over the summer, gave approval for Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices to sell their less-powerful chips to China in exchange for 15% of sales revenue. Beijing reportedly told companies not to buy those chips.Chinese President Xi Jinping \"responded positively\" to the latest proposal, Trump wrote in the social media post.CNBC has reached out to the Chinese Embassy in Washington, D.C., for comment.Experts warn that giving China access to the better chips will shrink America's hardware advantage and help Chinese developers vastly improve their AI models and other tech.Some of Trump's Republican allies appear to agree.\"Alarm bells go off in my head here,\" Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., told CNBC on Tuesday when asked about the chip sales agreement.\"I don't mind doing normal business with China. But if you can prove to me this will accelerate their military capability, I'll oppose it,\" Graham said.\"My general view on this is that China's progress on AI is almost entirely parasitic on our technology, in particular on our hardware,\" Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., said on Capitol Hill earlier Tuesday.\"So I don't want China to win the AI race. I want to win the AI race,\" Hawley said. \"But if we want to beat China, I think we need to constrain their ability to leverage our own technology, and I think we would want to reduce their access to our hardware, not increase it.\"Hawley did not directly criticize Trump, and noted that the president is privy to more information about the situation than he is. \"So I think he deserves some deference here,\" Hawley said.\"But I think in the general matter I would want to constrain American hardware going to China,\" he added.Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, asked about the chip agreement, was more succinct. \"I'm concerned,\" he said. Cornyn did not respond to follow-up questions.The U.S. House Select Committee on China, a Republican-led panel formed to focus on the \"threat posed by the Chinese Communist Party,\" echoed Hawley's concerns.\"Right now, China is far behind the United States in chips that power the AI race. Because the H200s are far better than what China can produce domestically, both in capability and scale, @nvidia selling these chips to China could help it catch up to America in total compute,\" the committee said in a statement on X.Beijing will use the H200s, which boast significantly more processing power and memory bandwidth than China's top chips, \"to strengthen its military capabilities and totalitarian surveillance,\" the panel's statement said.\"Finally, Nvidia should be under no illusions – China will rip off its technology, mass produce it themselves, and seek to end Nvidia as a competitor,\" the panel said. \"That is China's playbook and it is using it in every critical industry.\"Asked for comment on the GOP lawmakers' remarks, White House spokesman Kush Desai told CNBC, \"The Trump administration is committed to ensuring the dominance of the American tech stack – without compromising on national security.\"Not all Republicans are piling on.\"I don't have a real problem with providing them some [chips],\" Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., told CNBC. \"But we've got to know where it is, how they're using it, those sorts of things.\"But there is vocal support among both parties for slowing China's ability to obtain the world's best chips.Sen. Pete Ricketts, R-Neb., last week introduced bipartisan legislation that would direct the Trump administration to deny export licenses for advanced chips to China and other foreign adversaries for at least 30 months.\"The best AI chips are made by American companies. Denying Beijing access to these AI chips is essential to our national security,\" Ricketts said in a press release unveiling the bill.Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., one of the bill's co-sponsors, said, \"It's crucial that we protect American AI innovation from Communist China to win the AI race.\"Read more CNBC politics coverageTrump officials move to end student loan payment pause for millions of borrowersJudge unseals Ghislaine Maxwell grand jury materials, citing Epstein files actUkraine at 'critical moment' in war as European allies ramp up pressure on RussiaDemocrats establish AI working group as industry bolsters DC presenceEx-Trump lawyer Habba resigns as NJ U.S. attorney after disqualificationTrump announces $12 billion aid package for farmers caught up in trade warTrump says Netflix, WBD deal could be 'problem' as son-in-law backs Paramount bidSupreme Court to hear case on Trump birthright citizenship orderTrump can fire labor, employment board members without cause: Appeals courtTrump administration views Netflix, Warner Bros. deal with 'heavy skepticism'Costco adds Biden Commerce Sec.

Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., highlighted the fact that the Department of Justice touted a crackdown on a \"major China-linked AI tech smuggling network\" shortly before Trump announced the H200 sales agreement.\"Trump is letting NVIDIA export cutting-edge AI chips that his own DOJ revealed are being illegally smuggled into China,\" she wrote on X. \"His own DOJ called these chips 'building blocks of AI superiority,'\" she noted.Warren added that she wants Trump and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick to \"answer to Congress on why they are selling out US security.\"— CNBC's Mary Catherine Wellons and Justin Papp contributed to this report.",

    "body": "US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer testifies during a US Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies hearing on 2026 funding priorities, on Capitol Hill in Washington, DC, Dec. 9, 2025.Saul Loeb | AFP | Getty ImagesU.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer told a Senate Appropriations subcommittee on Tuesday that the deadline for China to buy 12 million metric tons of soybeans from American farmers was not the end of December as the White House has said, but the end of the \"growing season.\"Greer's comment at the hearing came on the heels of a report by NBC News showing that the pace of China's purchase of soybeans in recent weeks was well short of reaching the agreed amount by the end of the calendar year.China, which in October agreed to end its monthslong boycott of American soybeans amid a trade war, to date has bought only about 3 million metric tons, the trade representative told members of the  Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies subcommittee.Greer said there was a \"discrepancy\" in what the White House has described as the deadline and the actual deadline for the purchases to be completed.The most recent growing season for soybeans ended in November, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.CNBC has asked Greer's office whether there is a hard or rough deadline for China to reach 12 million metric tons of purchases, as agreed to as part of a trade agreement with President Donald Trump in October.Greer's disclosure came in response to a question by Sen. Deb Fischer, R-Neb.\"There remains anxiety about if and when China will fully follow through on those purchase commitments that were made,\" Fischer said.She noted that the White House fact sheet on the trade deal said China would purchase 12 million metric tons by the end of the calendar year -- contradicting recent comments from Greer.The fact sheet says, \"China will purchase at least 12 million metric tons (MMT) of U.S. soybeans during the last two months of 2025 and also purchase at least 25 MMT of U.S. soybeans in each of 2026, 2027, and 2028.\"Greer told Fischer, \"It is for this growing season, so, thank you for highlighting that.\"'\"We've heard from a couple farmers, they wanted to know about that discrepancy, and it is a discrepancy, it's through the growing season,\" he said.Joe Glauber, a former U.S. Department of Agriculture chief economist during the Obama administration, told CNBC in an interview he doesn't know what the administration means when it refers to the growing season.\"It's not a term that USDA means by any chance,\" Glauber said. \"Does that mean at harvests or does that mean actually the end of the marketing year, which is the more common way?\"Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent last week said that he expected China to reach the 12 million metric ton mark by \"the end of the season.\"\"So I think that'll be February 28th,\" Bessent said, during an interview with Andrew Ross Sorkin at The New York Times \"Deal Book Summit\" in New York. \"They are in a perfect cadence to complete that goal,\" Bessent said, after Ross Sorkin said data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture as of Nov. 14 showed that China had only purchased 330,000 metric tons.Bessent called the figure Ross Sorkin cited \"bad information.\"Glauber said the marketing year for soybeans is September, when the soybeans are harvested and ready to sell, through August of the next year. China would be more likely to hit buying targets from the U.S. by next August, since Brazil dominates the soybean market in the early months of the new year that coincides with their harvest season and cheap prices. The U.S. typically exports more to China later in the year, when its soybeans are cheaper.But that's a far longer time than the initial two-month window the White House pitched when it announced the China framework.\"That's a long time,\" he said. \"This is not any sort of immediate relief.\"CNBC has asked USDA for comment on Greer's remarks.

    "body": "Power generating wind turbines tower over the rural landscape on July 5, 2025 near Pomeroy, Iowa.Scott Olson | Getty ImagesA federal judge on Monday struck down President Donald Trump's sweeping ban on new wind power projects in the U.S., a major victory for an industry that has been singled out by the White House since the administration's first day.Judge Patti Saris of the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts ruled that Trump's ban is \"arbitrary and capricious and contrary to law,\" tossing out the president's action in its entirety.  Trump issued a memorandum on Jan. 20 halting permits and leases for offshore and onshore wind farms, pending federal review. Saris said that federal agencies had failed to provide a reasoned explanation for such a drastic change in U.S. policy. Seventeen states led by New York Attorney General Letitia James sued Trump in May to overturn the president's ban. They argued it created \"an existential threat to the wind industry.\"watch now\"This is a big victory in our fight to keep tackling the climate crisis and protect one of our best sources of clean, reliable, and affordable energy,\" James said in a post Monday on social media platform X. States in the Northeast and mid-Atlantic in particular have been pursuing offshore wind projects to meet future energy demand as they seek to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. White House spokeswoman Taylor Rogers said in a statement that \"offshore wind projects were given unfair, preferential treatment while the rest of the energy industry was hindered by burdensome regulations.\"  watch now",

    "body": "President Donald Trump on Tuesday claimed to have \"just heard\" that all four of former President Joe Biden's appointments to the Federal Reserve were approved by \"autopen,\" suggesting they are not authorized to serve in those roles.Trump provided no evidence for the claim, which piggybacks on his repeated assertion that all of his predecessor's documents that were signed using an autopen are invalid.But he said he thinks it is \"something we have to look into.\" And the president suggested that the list of autopen-signed appointees could include Fed Chair Jerome Powell, who has faced near-constant criticism from Trump over his handling of the central bank and U.S. interest rate levels.Trump's comments came on the eve of a meeting by the Fed's Federal Open Market Committee, which sets interest rates. After reentering the White House for his second term in January, Trump for months had repeatedly pressed Powell and the Fed, without success, to cut interest rates, and lambasted them when they failed to do his bidding.The FOMC in September made its first rate cut of Trump's current term, and then cut them again in October. The FOMC is expected to reduce rates for a third time on Wednesday. Trump, in his first term, appointed Powell as Fed chair. Biden reappointed Powell in 2021. The chairman's term is set to expire in May.Three other current members of the Fed's Board of Governors — Vice Chair Philip Jefferson, Michael Barr,  Lisa Cook — are Biden appointees. With Powell, they comprise a majority of the Fed's board.The autopen comments came during a campaign-style speech in Mount Pocono, Pennsylvania, where Trump had traveled to speak about the economy and counter Democrats' messaging about an affordability crisis in the U.S.\"By the way, it looks — you're gonna have to check this, please — I just heard, it could be that all four commissioners in the Fed signed by Biden ... I hear that the autopen may have signed those commissions,\" Trump said.Trump interspersed his accusation with criticism for Powell, derisively calling him \"Too Late\" and claiming JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon had urged the central bank chief to lower rates.\"But I hear that the autopen may have signed those commissions. If they signed those commissions — now maybe I'm wrong, but we're going to check,\" Trump said.He then appeared to address a member of his administration, asking, \"Have you checked that?

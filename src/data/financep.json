    "body": "Among Americans' favorite romantic comedies are \"Pretty Woman,\" \"Sleepless in Seattle\" and \"Sixteen Candles,\" according to a series of 2023 YouGov polls.In those and the many romcoms like them, the plot is fairly simple: The female lead pines after a man, they end up together, often after a series of kooky encounters. The end. The trope echoes a long-held belief about male-female dynamics.\"There's kind of a stereotype out there that women want or need relationships more than men,\" says Justin Lehmiller, senior research fellow at the Kinsey Institute, \"and that women would be more inclined to commit faster to a relationship.\"But a recent DatingNews.com and Kinsey Institute study of 2,000 U.S. singles refutes that claim.More than a quarter, 28.6% of men would speed up their move-in timeline in a relationship and 18.8% would marry sooner, according to the study. That's as compared to 18.8% of women who'd move in faster and 13.7% who'd marry sooner.According to Kinsey's findings, their motivating factor is financial: More men would speed up these milestones to save money.And that should come as no surprise, given the current economic climate, with job openings and hiring slowing and tariffs pushing prices higher. But, experts say there's more to it.There's kind of a stereotype out there that women want or need relationships more than men.Justin LehmillerSenior research fellow, Kinsey InstituteFor heterosexual men in particular, \"romantic relationships really become their primary source of social and emotional support,\" says Lehmiller. \"And so when men don't have that in their lives, we see that their levels of psychological well-being are lower.\"It's a trend Geoff MacDonald, scholar of singlehood and a professor of psychology at the University of Toronto, knows well. MacDonald's MacLab focuses on wellbeing in singlehood and has found that women are more likely to be happy single than men.\"Women are just better at getting that kind of support through their friendships and through their family relationships,\" MacDonald says. \"Men tend to struggle with that more on their own.\"That could be as a result of cultural pressure, Lehmiller says.Traditional notions of masculinity \"restrict when and how men are able to express their emotions,\" he says. \"So they don't tend to get as close to their male friends or to have other people in their lives that they have close intimate relationships with.\"Romantic relationships help men meet those needs.Researchers aren't the only ones seeing men's eagerness to couple up. Kyle Scheinkman has been working at relationship coaching company Relationship Hero since 2018, first as a coach to clients and now as the director of coaching. The company's 100 or so coaches primarily offer services within the romantic relationship context, from relationship strengthening to help for those looking to find a partner.\"Generally speaking, men are more likely to sign up for coaching,\" he says. \"They're more likely to have more sessions and to spend more on coaching in the long run.\"Want to earn more and grow your money? Save 30% with this earnings-boosting bundle of our top courses.Plus, sign up for CNBC Make It's newsletter to get tips and tricks for success at work, with money and in life, and request to join our exclusive community on LinkedIn to connect with experts and peers.",

    "body": "George Santos, who was expelled from the U.S. House of Representatives, arrives for the sentencing in his criminal corruption charges at Central Islip Federal Courthouse in Central Islip, New York, U.S., April 25, 2025.Shannon Stapleton | ReutersPresident Donald Trump on Friday evening said he has commuted the prison sentence of George Santos, releasing the disgraced former Republican congressman immediately.Santos \"was somewhat of a 'rogue,' but there are many rogues throughout our Country that aren't forced to serve seven years in prison,\" Trump wrote in a Truth Social post.Santos was sentenced to 87 months in federal prison this year after pleading guilty to committing wire fraud and aggravated identity theft. He began serving his sentence in late July.The 37-year-old New York representative served in the House for less than a year before he was expelled from Congress under a cloud of scandal in December 2023.Even before he was sworn in, Santos admitted lying about key details of his life on the campaign trail. While in Congress, he was charged by the Department of Justice with an array of federal crimes, including fraud, theft, money laundering and making false statements.Trump's decision to commute Santos' sentence came after multiple friends and allies of the imprisoned ex-politician made appeals for his clemency, a senior White House official told NBC News on Friday evening.Trump had also recently read Santos' writings from prison describing his living conditions, the official told NBC.In a flattery-filled letter published Monday in local Long Island news outlet The South Shore Press, Santos directly asked Trump for clemency.\"You have always been a man of second chances, a leader who believes in redemption and renewal,\" Santos wrote. \"I am asking you now, from the depths of my heart, to extend that same belief to me.\"Read more CNBC politics coverageIllinois Gov.

Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., who weathered heavy criticism during his 2010 Senate campaign for saying he had \"served in Vietnam\" when he had never been deployed there.Trump had said earlier in October that Blumenthal \"should be investigated, and Justice should be sought.\" The attack came hours after Attorney General Pam Bondi, in a combative and politically charged Senate hearing, directly accused Blumenthal of lying about his military record.Blumenthal said in 2010 that he had misspoken about his service on multiple occasions. On CNN last week, the senator said Trump's accusations are \"completely deceptive and distorted.\"Trump did not serve in the military after receiving five draft deferments during the Vietnam War.Trump wrote Friday that Blumenthal's record \"is far worse than what George Santos did, and at least Santos had the Courage, Conviction, and Intelligence to ALWAYS VOTE REPUBLICAN!\"\"George has been in solitary confinement for long stretches of time and, by all accounts, has been horribly mistreated,\" Trump wrote.\"Therefore, I just signed a Commutation, releasing George Santos from prison, IMMEDIATELY. Good luck George, have a great life!\"Santos' attorney confirmed Santos was released from Federal Correctional Institution Fairton in New Jersey at 11 a.m. ET on Saturday.",

    "body": "The Zion Bank main office in Salt Lake City, Utah, US, on Friday, April 7, 2023. George Frey | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesZions Bancorporation lost $1 billion of its valuation in a single day on Thursday after disclosing $60 million worth of loans it had made that were unlikely to be repaid.What led to that point was a messy, tangled web of loans that Zions said were surreptitiously subordinated by the borrowers all while the collateral was effectively eliminated.Shares of regional banks tumbled on Thursday as fears mounted around the health of their lending businesses. Zions' 13% share plunge ended up sparking worries about possible broader issues with lending for the regional bank sector, knocking the whole U.S. stock market on Thursday with the Dow Jones Industrial average finishing lower by 300 points.Zions' subsidiary, California Bank & Trust, is suing Andrew Stupin and Gerald Marcil – the until now, relatively unknown managers of several funds utilizing the name \"Cantor Group,\" along with their associate Deba Shyam.The lawsuit, filed in Los Angeles County on Wednesday, alleges, a \"sweeping betrayal of trust by sophisticated financial borrowers who abused CB&T's confidence, manipulated loan structures for their own enrichment, and systematically eliminated the collateral protections that were supposed to secure the bank's loans.\"Zions and a lawyer representing the defendants didn't respond to CNBC's multiple requests seeking comment. The relationship in question stemmed from about $60 million in financing that Zions' CB&T made in 2016 and 2017 to two related investment vehicles, Cantor Group II and Cantor Group IV.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconZions, 5 dayThe credit facilities were to be used by the funds to purchase distressed residential and commercial mortgage loans.Zions said they had an underwritten agreement guaranteeing them first-priority interest, meaning the bank's claim on collateral was superior to other creditors' claims in the event of a default.However, the deeds that were supposed to to secure the loans were ultimately subordinated without CB&T's knowledge, Zions said in the lawsuit.Those underlying properties were transferred to other entities or were in foreclosure, meaning the collateral was \"irretrievably lost,\" Zions claimed.And the new senior lenders, who replaced CB&T, were the same managers of the Cantor funds or those affiliated with the group, according to the suit. \"In effect, CB&T's losses became Defendants' gains,\" Zions said in the lawsuit. \"Acting through a web of affiliated companies, the borrowers and guarantors orchestrated a scheme that enriched themselves while stripping CB&T of its collateral, all while keeping the bank in the dark for years about the true status of its securities interests…\"The way that Zions found out about this was after a related Cantor fund, managed by the same leadership, was sued for fraud by Western Alliance.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconWestern Alliance, 5-dayThat caused CB&T to initiate its own investigation. Zions subsequently put out an 8-K on Wednesday, saying \"based on currently available information,\" it decided to take a provision for the $60 million outstanding loans and charge off $50 million, which will be reflected in third-quarter earnings when the company reports Monday.Western Alliance said in a separate 8-K following the Zions one that it had initiated its own lawsuit against Cantor, alleging fraud by the borrower for \"failing to provide collateral loans in the first position, among other claims.\" However, Western Alliance said it believes the existing collateral covers the obligation and affirmed its guidance. Western Alliance reports earnings on Tuesday.",

    "body": "Elon Musk, CEO of SpaceX and Tesla, attends the Viva Technology conference at the Porte de Versailles exhibition center in Paris on June 16, 2023.Gonzalo Fuentes | ReutersTop proxy advisor Institutional Shareholder Services is recommending that Tesla investors vote against a pay plan for CEO Elon Musk that would grant him nearly $1 trillion more in stock.The \"mega performance equity award\" to Musk, designed to retain the CEO long-term, \"has an astronomical grant value conditioned upon far-reaching performance targets that, if achieved, would create enormous value for shareholders,\" ISS wrote on Friday.Tesla's 2025 annual shareholder meeting and proxy vote is scheduled for Nov. 5. The company is scheduled to report third-quarter results on Wednesday. ISS said that while some shareholders may support the pay plan, \"there are unmitigated concerns surrounding the special award's magnitude and design.\"Musk's plan, if approved, would be the largest ever awarded to a public company CEO. It could could net Musk up to an additional 12% stake in Tesla, should the company hit a market cap of $8.5 trillion and achieve other goals.Tesla disagreed with the ISS recommendations.In a post on X, which is owned by Musk, the automaker accused ISS of missing \"fundamental points of investing and governance,\" and complained that the advisors had previously \"recommended against compensation that shareholders have voted on twice before (and that Elon has already earned), as well as the 2025 CEO Performance Award (where Elon receives nothing unless shareholders win big).\"The company urged shareholders to vote with the board's recommendations on all proposals on the 2025 proxy.ISS previously advised investors to reject a \"ratification\" of Musk's 2018 CEO pay package, which was worth an estimated $56 billion at the time.The Delaware Court of Chancery ruled early last year that the 2018 pay plan had been improperly granted by the Tesla board and must be rescinded. The ruling said Tesla hid crucial details from shareholders that they were entitled to before voting, and that Musk had controlled the board.Musk has appealed that court's decision to the Delaware State Supreme Court, with opening arguments in the appeal heard by a panel of judges this week.Representatives for ISS declined to comment beyond the report.ISS, along with Glass Lewis and smaller peers, can influence how shareholders decide to cast their votes at annual elections. Musk accused ISS and Glass Lewis in 2023 of effectively controlling the stock market because of their influence with passive or index funds in some matters. He also baselessly compared ISS to a terrorist organization.Musk will be able to vote his own shares in the vote concerning his future pay. He holds at least 13.5% of Tesla's voting power, according to the most recent available disclosures on his stake. Those holdings alone could be enough to secure approval for the nearly $1 trillion pay package.In September, Musk added to his ownership of Tesla stock buying another $1 billion worth of shares.Among other ISS recommendations, the firm also suggested that shareholders should vote against giving Tesla's board authorization to invest in xAI, the AI company that Musk started in March 2023 but only disclosed publicly in July that year. Tesla has sold tens of millions of dollars worth of its Megapack battery energy storage systems to xAI.ISS also recommended against voting to reinstate Tesla board member Ira Ehrenpreis, a longstanding and close friend of Musk.In May, Tesla changed its corporate bylaws to limit shareholders' ability to sue for a breach of fiduciary duties so that only a shareholder that owns at least 3% of the company's stock can bring what's called a \"derivative\" action. Ehrenpreis presided over Tesla's governance committee at the time that change was made without a shareholder vote.WATCH: Former Tesla board member says it's hard to argue with valuationwatch now",

    "description": "The longer you wait to give your child a smartphone or allow them to join social media, the happier and more successful they're likely to be as adults",
    "body": "The longer you wait to give your child a smartphone or allow them to join social media, the happier and more successful they're likely to be as adults, says psychologist Jean Twenge.To help parents facilitate that technological delay, Twenge recommends starting to teach kids how to use those technologies in safe and healthy ways at least six years in advance. Starting early helps prepare children to have healthier relationships with online technologies, aiding their development into well-adjusted, successful adults, she says.\"Ideally, it's great to have these rules in mind by the time your kids are in late elementary school, say, to be prepared. Because kids are getting these devices younger and younger,\" says Twenge, a professor of psychology at San Diego State University whose latest book, \"10 Rules for Raising Kids in a High-Tech World,\" published on September 2.In her book, Twenge recommended against social media for kids until age 16, and wrote that children shouldn't have a smartphone unless they also have a driver's license and are expected to \"get around independently.\" Her rationale: Those technologies are contributing to higher rates of mental health issues in teens, such as anxiety and depression, she wrote.DON'T MISS: The ultimate guide to starting a business—everything you need to know to be your own bossThose statements made headlines, particularly because many U.S. parents give their kids smartphones and social media access much earlier. In one recent Pew Research Center survey, more than half of U.S. parents said their kids between the ages of 11 and 12 already had their own smartphones.If you talk with your children about how to use internet technology responsibly before they turn 10, or younger if they already regularly use internet-connected devices like laptops, you can help them understand and internalize the potential downsides of excessive smartphone and social media usage, she says.You might, for example, discuss the types of personal information you shouldn't share with anyone online, from nude pictures to personal information like a home address or Social Security Number. You could talk about the value of privacy — reminding your kids to never assume a text or Snapchat message will remain private, and to not post any information or opinions online that they wouldn't be comfortable having announced over the loudspeaker at their school.Twenge also advises teaching children that \"your time is a precious resource,\" and that they might ultimately regret spending much of their youth absorbed in a device instead of engaging with friends and family in person, she says.The idea is to hopefully set them up to have a healthier relationship with those technologies as they age, says Twenge. But these conversations alone won't guarantee success, she says — because you need to do something else, too.Initiate healthy dialogue, 'then put the parental controls in place'Twenge's other top piece of advice: Set firm rules around how your kids can use devices and the internet, once you're comfortable with them doing so.One of the rules in Twenge's book bans smartphones during the school day and overnight in kids' bedrooms. Another of her rules states that that if parents want to give their child a device, their first phone should be a \"basic\" one — a phone that isn't connected to the internet, but does allow them to make calls and send texts to their friends and family.You could also use parental controls to guide kids' initial smartphone experiences, like setting daily time limits for usage to ensure kids aren't getting sucked into social media for hours at a time, or blocking adult-themed websites and apps.\"Teach them that moderation is key — and then put the parental controls in place to make sure you're not wasting your breath,\" Twenge wrote.Whatever you do, communicate your rules directly to your children, she says.\"We're going to have that conversation [and] be very clear about what controls we're putting on that phone,\" says Twenge. \"Even when she gets that smartphone, [for] one example, we're going to block app downloads, so then if she wants to put additional apps on it, it's a discussion, rather than her just doing it unilaterally, where we don't even know what she has on it.\"If your kids already have smartphones or social media, and you're starting to regret that decision, don't feel like it's ever too late to reverse those choices, Twenge notes. Just be honest and transparent about why they're making that decision, she says: \"Look, I made a mistake. I've learned more and we're going to do it differently going forward...\"Even if your teen's initial reaction is extreme — \"You might get some slammed doors,\" she notes — stay firm and try and put everything in perspective, she suggests. \"Tell them, 'Hey, you're still going to be able to text your friends. You're still going to be able to call me. And it's this or no fun at all.' That helps put it in context.\"Want to earn more and grow your money? Save 30% with this earnings-boosting bundle of our top courses.Plus, sign up for CNBC Make It's newsletter to get tips and tricks for success at work, with money and in life, and request to join our exclusive community on LinkedIn to connect with experts and peers.",

The company's annual Dreamforce conference was held in downtown San Francisco from Tuesday through Thursday of this week.\"We don't have enough cops, so if they can be cops, I'm all for it,\" Benioff told the Times.Benioff faced blowback for his comments from local politicians and other leaders. California Governor Gavin Newsom and San Francisco politicians on Wednesday issued statements and held press conferences to deliver the message that federal troops are not welcome in the city, and that crime is coming down.Prominent startup investor Ron Conway, who backed companies including Google, Airbnb and Stripe, resigned from the board of the Salesforce Foundation on Thursday. According to the New York Times, Conway told Benioff in an email that their \"values were no longer aligned.\" Conway is a longtime Democratic donor who was a member of VCs for Kamala, and donated around $500,000 to at least two funds tied to Kamala Harris' unsuccessful 2024 election campaign. While Benioff has donated to members of both parties, he has supported Democrats for president, including Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton and Kamala Harris.Venture capitalist David Sacks, who is now Trump's AI and crypto czar, said after the news about Conway that Benioff could join the Republicans. On Tuesday, Sacks, a longtime friend and associate of Elon Musk, was featured with Benioff in an onstage interview at Dreamforce. \"Dear Marc @Benioff, if the Democrats don't want you, we would be happy for you to join our team,\" Sacks wrote on X. \"Cancel culture is over, and we are the inclusive party.\"Following Benioff's initial comment to the Times, Benioff appeared to walk back his comments, writing on X that safety is \"first and foremost, the responsibility of our city and state leaders.\" However, by that point,  Musk and other right-wing figures had seized on his original comments, amplifying them to their audiences.Musk, who has drawn criticism for his personal drug use, characterized downtown San Francisco as a \"drug zombie apocalypse.\" And on Wednesday, Trump called San Francisco \"a mess,\" and suggested possibly sending in the National Guard.\"My earlier comment came from an abundance of caution around the event, and I sincerely apologize for the concern it caused,\" Benioff wrote in his Friday post. \"It's my firm belief that our city makes the most progress when we all work together in a spirit of partnership.\"Opposition to Benioff's initial suggestion also came from Garry Tan, CEO of startup incubator Y Combinator. He wrote on X that \"We don't need the National Guard,\" but he used his post to go after liberal local officials and judges perceived as too lenient.— CNBC's Lora Kolodny contributed to this report.

    "body": "If you or your child are hoping to attend college anytime soon, cost is likely top of mind. Top schools continue to increase tuition while many young adults fall deeper and deeper into debt. By the second quarter of this year, outstanding U.S. student loan debt topped $1.8 trillion, according to the Education Data Initiative.To keep costs down, prospective students could ideally win several scholarships. But that can be easier said than done.However, Carlynn Greene has done it — and she suspects you can too.Greene won 30 scholarships to attend both undergraduate and graduate school at the University of North Texas, graduating with no debt and degrees in broadcast journalism and public relations, advertising and applied communication.She's put those skills to use, working as a full-time content creator and the founder of Scholarship Guru, through which she's helped clients secure millions of dollars in scholarship awards.\"There are a lot of mistakes people make when it comes to scholarships,\" Greene says. Among the biggest, she says, is failing to put your best foot forward to in your essay.\"I always tell my students that you want to try and approach it as if you were marketing yourself, because a lot of the principles that we learn from marketing can be applied to scholarships,\" she says. \"Because you're trying to convince someone as to why they should invest in your education over someone else that's competing against you.\"Here's what Greene sees as the most common mistakes applicants run into when applying for scholarships — and how you can avoid them.1. Focusing on national scholarshipsIt's going to be hard for anyone — no matter how strong their essay — to stand out amid an enormous applicant pool, Greene says.\"Nine times out of 10, when people are starting out, they're applying for the ones that have very broad eligibility,\" she says. And while these national scholarships can come with five- or six-figure rewards, \"you are much more likely to win scholarships that are local, state level and also ones that I like to call intersectionality scholarships.\"By that, she means awards with multiple criteria that may describe you, including race, gender, geographic location and area of study. \"That will narrow down the competition pool,\" she says.2. Not treating yourself like a hot commodityGreene recommends imbuing your application materials with concepts from the world of marketing: scarcity and urgency. In essence, how are you or your academic goals unique — and why should you receive funding now?A medical student, for instance, may want to highlight that they plan to specialize in treating a rare and deadly disease, Greene says.\"If you find relevant data, like from a news article or research article that points this out and highlights it, that would communicate to the audience, the judges, that investing in your education makes more sense, as opposed to someone who perhaps is going into, let's say, plastic surgery,\" she says.3. Only applying to a handful of scholarshipsIt can be easy to get discouraged if you fail to win scholarships you were hoping for, but Greene says it can be a numbers game, even for excellent applicants.\"I won 30 scholarships, but I applied for a little over 100,\" she says. \"I've had another student, she won 20 scholarships. She applied for a little over 200. So it just depends.\"In addition to her website, Greene recommends using online tools such as Bold.org and Going Merry to find scholarships that meet your criteria and that you can apply for in bulk.Overall, for an average student, Greene recommends applying for anywhere from 100 to 200 scholarships.\"It can seem overwhelming, but when you compare it to even applications in the job market now, a lot of people are applying for hundreds of jobs,\" she says.Want to earn more and grow your money? Save 30% with this earnings-boosting bundle of our top courses.Plus, sign up for CNBC Make It's newsletter to get tips and tricks for success at work, with money and in life, and request to join our exclusive community on LinkedIn to connect with experts and peers.",

    "body": "Kremlin envoy proposes 'Putin-Trump tunnel' to link Russia and U.S.\nReutersPresident Donald Trump said Friday that a Russian proposal for Elon Musk and his tunneling business, the Boring Company, to build an undersea rail tunnel through the Bering Strait was \"interesting\" and he'd have to think about it.\"That's an interesting one,\" Trump said when asked about the suggested tunnel from Russia to Alaska. \"We'll have to think about that. I hadn't heard that.\"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said he was \"not happy\" with the idea following Trump's response.Kirill Dmitriev, an investment envoy for Russian President Vladimir Putin, suggested in posts on Musk's social media platform X that the project would be partly funded by Moscow.Dmitriev said it would be \"a 70-mile link symbolizing unity.\"A tunnel like this would traditionally cost an estimated $65 billion to build, said Dmitriev, who is head of Russia's sovereign wealth fund, adding that The Boring Company and its technology could potentially reduce those costs to $8 billion and complete the project within eight years.\"Let's build a future together!\" he wrote.Read more CNBC tech newsBenioff's backing of Trump, troops in SF leads Salesforce Foundation director Conway to quitRay-Ban maker EssilorLuxottica says Meta smart glasses are boosting growthChinese robotaxi company Pony.ai to work with Stellantis on Europe expansionSpotify moves further into AI music with Sony, Universal, Warner partnershipDmitriev's suggestion followed a call between Putin and Trump on Thursday, during which plans were made to discuss possible resolutions to the Ukraine War.Trump said Secretary of State Marco Rubio and other high-level advisors will meet next week with a Russian delegation before Trump and Putin meet in Budapest, Hungary, at a future date.Musk did not respond to a request for comment about the proposal.Construction of an undersea tunnel in the Bering Strait would require Musk's Boring Company to work through below-freezing temperatures in a region without existing infrastructure and with deep and frequent earthquakes.The Boring Company has no track record of working through such conditions.Its previous tunneling efforts were completed in hot, dry locations with plenty of infrastructure and services nearby.The Boring Company was recently fined and cited by environmental regulators in the state of Nevada for an \"extraordinary number of violations,\" ProPublica reported, citing public records. Those violations included: digging without approval, releasing untreated water onto city streets and spilling waste from trucks.The Boring Company is now working on a 10-mile tunnel project from downtown Nashville, Tennessee, to its airport, dubbed the Music City Loop. Residents protested, in part, due to the lack of planning before The Boring Company project was authorized in the flood-prone city.U.S. President Donald Trump (R) walks with Russian President Vladimir Putin as they arrives at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson on August 15, 2025 in Anchorage, Alaska.

    "body": "It was 95 degrees when the first prototype of a Norwegian Wool jacket arrived at Michael Berkowitz's apartment in The Bronx, New York, in August 2014.Needing to test the waterproof knee-length wool coat without getting heat stroke, the founder and CEO of the then-fledgling apparel brand took it to a supermarket in West Harlem. \"[I] paced back and forth for 30 minutes in a walk-in freezer\" to evaluate its lining for warmth, recalls Berkowitz, 38. \"It's New York, so no one stops you, no one asks you. My face was cold by the end, but my body was totally warm. I remember thinking, 'OK, we're on to something.'\"At the time, Berkowitz was a commodities trader hoping to launch his own business. Today, Norwegian Wool's coats adorn the shoulders of billionaires, actors, politicians and financiers — at campaign events, during the annual World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, and in a Season 3 episode of HBO's \"Succession.\" The apparel brand was profitable in 2024, and has been for seven out of the last eight years, Berkowitz says.DON'T MISS: The ultimate guide to starting a business—everything you need to know to be your own bossBerkowitz declined to share other financials, citing competitive pressure — but says his company's products are now sold in more than 100 stores worldwide, including Saks Fifth Avenue, Bloomingdales, Nordstrom and his appointment-only New York showroom.The appeal of Norwegian Wool coats is part form, part function. Financiers are expected to dress a certain way, but the classic wool Italian coats most of them wear aren't designed for sub-40-degree weather, says Berkowitz.\"If you show up wearing a [puffer coat] that looks like you're going to the Arctic, but it's only 40 degrees, you do not look like the person that's going to be able to break through walls and get a deal done,\" he says.Norwegian Wool's bestselling mid-length Euro Coats currently range from $1,545 to $2,945 each, depending on the type of wool used. The brand sells other lengths and styles, including blazers, sport coats, rain and ski jackets, and a variety of winter coat options and accessories for men and women. Roughly 40 billionaires have purchased Norwegian Wool coats, Berkowitz estimates.A luxury startup with modest rootsBerkowitz had the idea for Norwegian Wool while shivering on a subway platform with a friend in 2013, he says. \"I told him, 'I need a coat that looks good, that I could wear to work, that will actually keep me warm,'\" Berkowitz remembers. \"He put his arm on my shoulders, like, 'Dude, when you find it, get me one, too.'\"After doing some research, Berkowitz identified a simple culprit, he says: Many fashionable coats are designed in parts of Italy where the air rarely freezes. The average January temperature in Florence, for example, is roughly 40 degrees Fahrenheit — compared to 30 degrees in New York and 25 degrees in Chicago.Companies based in Canada and Scandinavia make warmer coats for harsher winters, but as one designer told him, the two industries \"don't talk to each other,\" he says.Norwegian Wool's showroom, located in New York's Midtown neighborhoodNorwegian WoolBerkowitz spent months flying to Italy and back to meet and woo factory owners, who'd ship prototypes to his apartment. He ultimately spent $250,000 — $50,000 of his own money and a $200,000 investment from the former CFO of his company, who'd heard about Berkowitz's efforts from a colleague — to sample the prototypes and order an initial run of 200 coats, he says.On nights, weekends and vacation days, Berkowitz carted those coats — one on his body and two in a small suitcase — to family-owned luxury stores across the U.S., he says. He often pitched directly to sales associates, who knew their clients' shared dilemma of wanting to feel warm while looking nice in a luxury coat, he says.He sold all 200 coats in three months and resigned from his day job in early 2015, he says.\"I didn't sleep much that year,\" says Berkowitz, adding that by day, he tried to hide his efforts to avoid jeopardizing his job. According to his former boss Alan Kestenbaum, now the CEO of New York-based holding company Bedrock Industries, he only ever came across as a \"street smart\" and eager employee who was \"the first to arrive and the last to leave.\"Like 'dipping your hand into warm butter'In 2017, Berkowitz landed his first partnership to sell coats at a major department store. The following year, Norwegian Wool participated in two fundraising rounds, both seven-figure deals with private investors, Berkowitz says. He remains the company's majority owner, he notes.Norwegian Wool coats are generally more expensive than Canada Goose parkas, and less pricey than cashmere coats from established Italian luxury brands like Loro Piana. But the quality of its materials is high, says \"Succession\" costume director Jon Schwartz: Norwegian Wool's cashmere feels like \"dipping your hand into warm butter.\"Berkowitz's dream for Norwegian Wool is a reputation akin to Range Rover cars — known worldwide for a blend of style and functionality, he says. He plans to add more product lines, invest in marketing and host pop-up retail events to improve the brand's visibility, he adds. Already, he's overheard Norwegian Wool come up in organic conversations, even when nobody realizes the brand's founder is in earshot, he says.If you show up wearing a [puffer coat] that looks like you're going to the Arctic, but it's only 40 degrees, you do not look like the person that's going to be able to break through walls and get a deal done.Michael BerkowitzFounder and CEO, Norwegian WoolAnd as someone squarely within Norwegian Wool's target demographic — businesspeople who want to make an impression with their appearance during cold winters, he says — he still tests many of the company's prototypes himself.Berkowitz outfitted himself and his friends with not-yet-released parkas for a February ski trip in the Alps. He brought a sample of a recently released bamboo blazer to Paris in September, tossing it on top of his rolling suitcase and into the plane's overhead bin to test it for wrinkling and pilling, he says.\"I test things out going to my office in Midtown or in vacation to the Alps,\" says Berkowitz. \"It doesn't matter where it is, as much as how I'm wearing it. It has to be representative of how our customers would wear it.\"Want to stand out, grow your network, and get more job opportunities? Sign up for Smarter by CNBC Make It's new online course, How to Build a Standout Personal Brand: Online, In Person, and At Work.

    "body": "In 2011, I walked away from a six-figure law career and retired at age 41. I thought I was prepared financially. But emotionally? Not so much.After decades of working, I was used to the sense of purpose that came with a career, and I assumed I'd have to give that up once I stopped working. My biggest fear took the form of one major uncertainty: What would I do with all that unstructured time?Fast forward 14 years later, and my days are anything but idle. My wife and I now live in Portugal, the No. 1 country Americans want to move to. I spend my free time enjoying local food with friends and hiking the wildflower-dotted coastal trails. Retiring early is one of the best decisions I've ever made ... but I remember how overwhelming it felt at the start.Here's what I've learned so far in early retirement, and why I don't regret it.1. Uncertainty is an opportunity, not an obstacleI followed a predictable path for most of my adult life: law school, summer associate gigs, and eventually a stable legal career. Then came the 2008 financial crisis. The firm I worked for collapsed — and with it, my sense of direction. I couldn't picture myself doing anything other than practicing law.I could've stayed in the industry. But instead, I chose the unknown. Most people think early retirement is about not working anymore. But it's about redefining your identity without a roadmap. That required a mindset shift: I had to become an explorer.Ocean fog envelopes Sintra forest, within Portugal's Sintra-Cascais Natural Park, near Lisbon.Alex TriasThat mindset brought us to Portugal, a country where we didn't speak the language, didn't know anyone, and had no idea what to expect day-to-day. It was disorienting at first. But the uncertainty became our motivation to grow, learn, and build a fulfilling life from scratch.If you're delaying retirement because you don't know what comes next, that might be exactly why it's worth doing. Uncertainty could be your opportunity to travel down paths you've never imagined.2. You can still get ahead financially, even without a paycheckWhen we first retired, my wife and I assumed we'd gradually draw down our savings over time and hope it would last. But something surprising happened: Our net worth kept growing.A major reason is that living in Portugal drastically reduced our expenses. Here's what we save annually compared to our old life in Washington, D.C.:$15,000 on state income taxes$25,000 on health insurance and deductibles$14,000 on property taxes$20,000 on food, entertainment, and daily costsIn total, we estimate that we save about $5,000 per month just by living abroad.We follow the same financial strategy we did while working: We live below our means, reinvest the difference, and let compounding do the work. The only difference is that now, instead of salaries, our income comes from investments.Retirement doesn't have to be the end of building wealth. It can even be the beginning of a more sustainable, intentional version of it.3. Finding purpose in retirement is just as important as finding it in your careerWhether you're working or not, most of us want the same thing: to feel like we matter and are making a contribution.Coastal event collides against the rocks at Guincho beach, located on Portugal's Estoril coast.Alex TriasWhen we first retired, we had a built-in sense of purpose as parents to a young child. We joined school activities, studied the local language, and built a new life in Lisbon.But when our daughter went off to college, we were back to square one. Our schedules emptied out, and we faced the same question we did in 2011: What do we do with all this time?Before diving into hobbies or commitments, we made a plan. We identified six core priorities that bring meaning to our lives:Building and strengthening friendshipsPersonal care and physical healthQuality time as a coupleTravelVolunteer work and giving backLearning new skillsOnce we had those priorities in place, it became easier to build a routine that felt fulfilling.Today, my wife volunteers at our tennis club, takes pottery and Dutch lessons, and plays sports. I'm focused on writing, freelance retirement coaching, and helping a local nonprofit as a consultant. We host dinner parties, explore new recipes, and take short trips around Europe.With the right mindset, early retirement can be the perfect new starting point. You just have to be willing to embrace it.Alex Trias is a retired attorney. He and his wife have been living in Portugal since 2015.

    "body": "watch nowDespite worries over bad loans at midsize U.S. banks, there's little evidence of a systemic problem, according to a senior analyst at Moody's Ratings.Marc Pinto, the agency's head of global private credit, acknowledged in a interview on CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" that there are concerns over loose lending standards and some slack in the conditions that institutions attach to loans.However, he said when looking at the system as a whole, contagion the likes that could trigger a broader financial crisis is not evident.\"When we dig deeper here and look to see if there's a turn in the credit cycle, which is effectively what the market seems to be focusing on, we can find no evidence,\" Pinto said. \"Now that's what we're seeing today. That could always change. But if we look at the asset quality numbers that we've seen over the last several quarters, we're seeing very little deterioration at all.\"Bank stocks sold off aggressively across the board Thursday after Zions and Bancorp and Western Alliance Bancorp disclosed holding bad loans related to the bankruptcies of two auto lenders. The worries have dragged down shares of investment bank Jefferies this month since it disclosed some exposure to bankrupt auto parts maker First Brands.Losses swept across the sector Thursday as worries grew that the danger could be more widespread. JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon raised some eyebrows earlier this week when he said on the bank's earnings conference call that \"when you see one cockroach, there are probably more.\"\"One cockroach does not a trend make,\" Pinto said.In fact, Pinto said default rates on high-yield debt this year have been relatively low, holding under 5%, and are expected to drift down to below 3% in 2026. By comparison, during the 2008 financial crisis, defaults in high-yield debt were in low double digits.At the same time, the U.S. economy has proven stronger than thought, Pinto added, despite persistent worries about labor market weakness and the impact that President Donald Trump's tariffs might have on inflation and consumer demand.Pinto said he is at a conference this week with about 2,000 bankers \"and one of the words that I keep hearing is resilience.\"\"With respect to GDP growth, we're doing much better than many people thought just six months ago,\" he said. \"So again, the credit conditions, looking at GDP growth as well as an expected decline in interest rates, we feel the credit quality is in a pretty good place today and potentially may improve.\"Market sentiment appeared to improve Friday after a sell-off Thursday.The SPDR S&P Regional Banking exchange-traded fund, which tracks the mid-market leaders, tumbled 6.2% Thursday but rose 2% in premarket trading Friday.",

    "body": "More travelers are heading to the mountains: Big Sky, Montana was named the top trending travel destination for 2026, according to a new report from Expedia, Hotels.com and Vrbo.The report ranks 10 global destinations on the rise based on increased flight and accommodation searches on Expedia from 24,000 global travelers over the last year.Big Sky, the Rocky Mountains town an hour's drive from Yosemite, may seems like it \"came out of nowhere,\" but it's \"long been known for world-class outdoor recreation, skiing and snowboarding in the winter and hiking, mountain biking and rafting in the summer,\" says Melanie Fish, travel expert for Expedia, Hotels.com, and Vrbo. Also adding to its charm are an evolving dining scene, growth in family-friendly offerings, community events and cultural activities, she tells CNBC Make It.Here are the top 10 hotspots for travelers in the coming year and how much search interest has risen from 2024:Big Sky, Montana, USA: 92% increaseOkinawa, Japan: 71% increaseSardinia, Italy: 63% increasePhu Quoc, Vietnam: 53% increaseSavoie, France: 51% increaseFort Walton Beach, Florida, USA: 45% increaseUcluelet, Canada: 44% increaseCotswolds, U.K.: 39% increaseSan Miguel de Allende, Mexico: 30% increaseHobart, Australia: 25% increaseOkinawa, a chain of islands with a subtropical climate in southern Japan, is the No. 2 trending destination for 2026, per Expedia searches.Travel to Japan surged in recent years thanks to a weak yen and lifted Covid restrictions, but some cities like Kyoto have introduced so-called tourist taxes to curb overcrowding. Meanwhile, Expedia recognized Okinawa for meeting its \"Smart Travel Health Check\" framework, aligned with World Travel and Tourism Council principles, for the region's efforts to offer cultural and natural experiences without the overcrowding seen in many major global cities.\"Expedia doesn't feel like it should or could be the arbiter of where travelers should visit or should want to visit, but we do play a role in informing travelers of what's happening in the places that they're making plans to travel to,\" Fish says about recognizing places that support sustainable travel practices.Kabira Bay, Ishigaki, Okinawa, Japan. The bay forms part of the Iriomote-Ishigaki National Park.Sean Pavone | Istock | Getty Images\"What we see in Okinawa is that they are taking proactive environmental measures like coral reef restoration, they're moving towards a decarbonized economy by using renewable energy sources,\" Fish says. \"They're celebrating local heritage and making sure visitors have educational opportunities.\"Rounding out the top three is Sardinia, another rising destination beyond hotspots like Rome, Florence or Venice. The island is the Mediterranean's second-largest after Sicily and is sometimes referred to as \"the Maldives of Europe\" because of its beaches.Parts of the region are considered a \"Blue Zone,\" an area of the world where people tend to live exceptionally long lives, thanks to healthy lifestyle habits, access to fresh food, and focuses on strong social ties and spirituality.\"Sardinia is going to take a little bit more effort to get to than the destinations that we are so familiar with, like Rome and Florence,\" Fish says, but travelers are finding it worthwhile to enjoy the island's beaches, food and diverse landscapes.\"There are beautiful coastlines, but then there's a mountainous interior, and then those charming towns,\" she says. \"That's really the trifecta of what travelers are looking for.\"Photo taken in Bosa, Oristano, Sardinia, Italy.Ellen Van Bodegom | Moment | Getty Images",

    "body": "watch nowThe U.S. Army Corps of Engineers will immediately pause, and consider canceling, over $11 billion in projects due to the government shutdown, Trump administration budget chief Russell Vought said Friday.\"The Democrat shutdown has drained the Army Corps of Engineers' ability to manage billions of dollars in projects,\" Vought, the director of the White House Office of Management and Budget, said in an X post.The paused funds pertain to \"lower-priority projects\" in cities including New York, San Francisco, Boston and Baltimore, Vought said.The Army Corps of Engineers, which provides a wide range of public engineering services and comprises more than 37,000 civilians and soldiers, did not immediately respond to CNBC's requests for comment on Vought's post.Vought, a co-author of the right-wing manual for major government overhaul known as Project 2025, has been the first to announce federal layoffs and funding pauses that the Trump administration says are consequences of the shutdown.President Donald Trump and Vought have also described the congressional funding lapse as an \"opportunity\" to slash the federal bureaucracy. Trump has repeatedly said that only Democrats' priorities are being targeted.On the day the shutdown began, Vought announced that the administration was freezing about $18 billion for two major infrastructure projects in New York City and canceling roughly $8 billion more for climate-related projects in Democratic-leaning states.Two days later, Vought said the administration froze another $2.1 billion in Department of Transportation funding earmarked for the Chicago transit system.The White House has also insisted that the shutdown will cause thousands of federal workers to be laid off. The administration said last week that more than 4,000 reduction-in-force notices had been issued; on Wednesday, Vought said the total job cuts would likely end up being \"north of 10,000.\"But a federal judge on Wednesday afternoon temporarily blocked the administration from firing government workers.",

(Photo Illustration by Piotr Swat/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images)Sopa Images | Lightrocket | Getty ImagesCompany: Keurig Dr Pepper (KDP)Business: Keurig Dr Pepper is a beverage company in North America that manufactures, markets, distributes and sells hot and cold beverages and single serve brewing systems. It has a portfolio of beverage brands, including Keurig, Dr Pepper, Canada Dry, Mott's, A&W, Penafiel, Snapple, 7UP, Green Mountain Coffee Roasters, GHOST, Clamato, Core Hydration and The Original Donut Shop, as well as the Keurig brewing system. Its U.S. refreshment beverages segment is a manufacturer and distributor of liquid refreshment beverages. This segment manufactures and distributes concentrates, syrup and finished beverages of its brands and third-party brands, to third-party bottlers, distributors, retailers and end consumers. Its U.S. coffee segment is a manufacturer and distributor of single-serve brewers, specialty coffee (including hot and iced varieties), and ready-to-drink coffee. Its international segment includes sales in Canada, Mexico, the Caribbean and other international markets.Stock Market Value: $36.11 billion ($26.59 per share)Stock Chart IconStock chart iconKeurig Dr Pepper stock performance year to dateActivist: Starboard ValueOwnership: n/aAverage Cost: n/aActivist Commentary: Starboard is a very successful activist investor and has extensive experience helping companies focus on operational efficiency and margin improvement. They are known for their excellent diligence and for running many of the most successful campaigns. Starboard has taken a total of 161 prior activist campaigns in their history and has an average return of 21.49% versus 13.81% for the Russell 2000 over the same period.What's happeningStarboard has taken a position in Keurig Dr Pepper and has held meetings with the company's management.Behind the scenesKeurig Dr Pepper is a leading North American beverage company. The core of the company is its U.S. refreshment beverage segment (63.9% of revenue), which includes the manufacturing and distribution of branded concentrates, syrups, and finished beverages. The U.S. coffee segment (22.77%) includes goods relating to Keurig pods, single-serve brewers and accessories, with the remaining revenue deriving from the international segment (13.33%). In January 2018, Dr Pepper Snapple Group and Keurig Green Mountain announced a merger, providing investors unique exposure to the fastest growing hot and cold beverage markets and their respective retail channels. However, this merger did not come without its challenges, including certain synergistic uncertainties. Moreover, as a result of the merger, JAB Holdings — the owner of Keurig — became the majority owner of the combined company, reducing Dr Pepper shareholders to a minority stake of just 13%, and flooding KDP's board with JAB affiliates. This dynamic changed earlier this year when three JAB-affiliated directors resigned following a series of divestures that reduced JAB's ownership to below 10% — now 4.4% following an additional block sale.As JAB began to turn over control and shareholders regained influence, investors began to advocate for a reseparation of the beverage and coffee assets. And management has responded — though not in the way shareholders expected — announcing a merger with coffee and tea company JDE Peet's, followed by a separation of the beverage and coffee assets, now including both Keurig and Peet's in the coffee business. Coincidentally, or not so coincidentally, JAB owns a controlling 68% stake in JDE Peet's. The move shocked investors and sent KDP shares down 25% upon the announcement. It is not that shareholders don't want a separation, but more the structure and negative consequences of the transaction as structured. The logical way to have accomplished this would have been through a spin out of the coffee business by KDP into JDE Peet's using a tax-free Reverse Morris Trust. This would be simpler, economically better for shareholders and make more sense since Keurig is smaller than Peet's. Instead, KDP structured it as an all-cash acquisition with a large premium and using an $18.5 billion loan to finance it, causing a projected leverage-to-earnings ratio of greater than 5x in 2026. Just as the Reverse Morris Trust would have been favorable to KDP shareholders, the structure ultimately agreed upon was as favorable, if not more, to JAB.Starboard has entered this engagement in an unusual position. In the case of a pending strategic transaction, we typically see activists emerge where they can help influence or block a bad deal for shareholders. But that is not happening here — this is a cash deal, leaving KDP shareholders without a vote. Starboard certainly has had extensive success operationally and from a board level with consumer and retail companies, including Kenvue, Papa John's and Darden Restaurants, and we can see them adding significant value here. But the better analogy may be to Starboard's prior engagement in Ritchie Bros Auctioneer, now RB Global. In that engagement, Starboard also became involved shortly after the company's announced merger with IAA – a deal met with similar shareholder opposition. Starboard entered into a $500 million securities purchase agreement with the company that removed certain roadblocks and opposition to the merger, allowing it to consummate. Importantly, Starboard was also granted a board seat for its CEO Jeff Smith, restoring a great deal of investor confidence in the company. By the time Smith resigned from RBA's board less than two years later, the company's stock had more than doubled.Given this track record, Starboard's involvement at KDP likely reflects a similar constructive approach, seeking board representation through amicable settlement, leveraging the fund's expertise to help guide KDP behind the scenes through this inflection point and helping restore investor confidence among this rightfully skeptical shareholder base. Moreover, given the recent decline in KDP's share price, Starboard likely sees this entry as an opportunity to invest at a compelling discount, similar to RBA, where short-term merger headwinds could provide significant upside for long-term and value-oriented shareholders like Starboard. KDP's nomination deadline is not until February, but we do not think that will be relevant here as meetings have already taken place between Starboard and management and we expect an amicable resolution before then.Ken Squire is the founder and president of 13D Monitor, an institutional research service on shareholder activism, and the founder and portfolio manager of the 13D Activist Fund, a mutual fund that invests in a portfolio of activist investments.",

    "body": "(This is the Warren Buffett Watch newsletter, news and analysis on all things Warren Buffett and Berkshire Hathaway. You can sign up here to receive it every Friday evening in your inbox.)Buffett's master class on the problem with goldThe price of gold slipped on Friday after hitting a record high above $4,300 an ounce earlier this week.It's still up more than 50% this year and has almost doubled since early last year.CNBC Pro's Fred Imbert notes gold is easily beating the S&P 500 this year, and turning in its best performance since 2008's financial crisis.He adds, \"What makes this time around so much more notable is that all the other instances of gold outperformance happened in bear markets for stocks or during major economic crises.\"Gold's incredible gains, and the modern ease of investing in the metal using ETFs, which may also be fueling some of those gains, have some strategists on Wall Street now saying that for many investors, the precious metal should play a role in a standard diversified portfolio.On Friday, CNBC.com reported that the traditional allocation of 60% stocks, 40% bonds is on its way out for many investors.In its place: a 60/20/20 split, with the bond bucket cut to 20% to make room for 20% in gold and bitcoin.Why?\"Stocks and bonds are moving in the same direction too often,\" the strategists say, \"while inflation, geopolitical risk, and government spending and high debt loads mean bonds no longer offer the protection they once did.\"watch nowWe haven't heard lately from 95-year-old Warren Buffett on the subject, but presumably he's avoiding the latest gold whirlwind.Over time, Buffett has always said gold is inferior as a long-term investment.At the 2011 Berkshire Hathaway annual meeting, he explained why, in responding to a question from a shareholder asked by CNBC's Andrew Ross Sorkin:ANDREW ROSS SORKIN: The commodity market, and particularly gold, have appreciated astronomically over the last few years...Please explain why you have not invested more heavily in commodities...WARREN BUFFETT: [There are] three major categories of investment. And you ought to think very hard about which category you want to be in before you start thinking about the choices available within that category.Now, the first category is anything denominated in a currency. It could be bonds, it could be deposits in a bank, it can be a money market fund, it can be cash in your pocket.And the — if you will reach in your pocket — I don't like to do this, but — and pull out your wallet —You're watching an historic event. (Laughter)If you look at this — and, I might point out, this is a one [dollar bill]. Charlie [Munger, Buffett's long-time late partner] carries a [hundred] —On the back of it, it says, \"In God We Trust.\" And that's really false advertising.The -- if Elizabeth Warren were here, she would say, quite properly, it should say, \"In Government We Trust,\" because God isn't going to do anything about that dollar bill, you know, if government does the wrong things, in terms of keeping it as valuable as it was when you parted with it to buy a bond or put it in a bank.Any currency-related investment is a bet on how government now, and in the future, will behave...Almost all currencies have declined in value over time. I mean, it may be built into almost any economic system that it will be easier to work with a value of currency that declines in value than a currency that appreciates in value, and the Japanese might reaffirm that here with their experience.So as a class, currency-related investments, whether they are in the UK, or the United States, or anyplace else — unless we're getting paid extremely well for having them — we do not think make much sense.The second category of investments regard items that you buy that don't produce anything but that you hope someone will pay you more for later on.And the classic case of that is gold.FILE PHOTO: 24 karat gold bars are seen at the United States West Point Mint facility in West Point, New York June 5, 2013.    Shannon Stapleton | ReutersAnd I've used this illustration before, but if you take all of the gold in the world — don't get too excited now — and put it into a cube, it will be a cube that's about 67 feet on a side. That would be 165,000 or 170,000 metric tons.So, you could have a cube — if you owned all the gold in the world — you could have a cube that would be 67 or 68 feet on a side.And you could get a ladder, and you could climb up on top of it, and you could say, you know, I'm sitting on top of the world, and think you're king of the world.You could, you know, you could fondle it, you could polish it, you could do all these things with it. Stare at it. But it isn't going to do anything.All you are doing when you buy that is that you're hoping that somebody else a year from now, or five years from now, will pay you more to own something that, again, can't do anything, but you're hoping that the person then thinks that somebody else will buy something five years later from him.In other words, you're betting on not just how scared people are now of paper money, you're betting on how much they think a year from now people will be scared two years from then on...Steverts | Istock | Getty ImagesThe third category of asset is something that you value based on its — that it will produce, what it will deliver.You buy a farm because you expect a certain amount of corn or soybeans or cotton or whatever it may be, to come your way every year.And you decide how much you pay based on how much you think the asset itself will deliver over time. And those are the assets that appeal to me and Charlie.Now, there's some logical follow-on to that. If you buy that farm, and you really think about how many bushels of corn, how much bushels of soybeans will it produce, how much do I have to pay the tenant farmer, how much do I have to pay in taxes and so on, you can make a rational calculation, and the success of that investment will be determined in your own mind by whether it meets your expectations as to what it delivers.Logically, you should not care whether you get a quote on that farm a day later, or a week later, or a month later, or a year later.We feel the same way about businesses.When we buy ISCAR [an Israeli precision metalworking company], or we buy Lubrizol, or whatever, we don't run around getting a quote on it every week and say, you know, 'Is it up or down?' or anything like that. We look to the business.We feel the same way about securities. When we buy a marketable security, we don't care if the stock exchange closes for a few years.So, when we look at Berkshire, we are looking at what we think can be delivered from the productive assets that we own, and how we can utilize that capital in acquiring more productive assets.At that same meeting, Buffett acknowledged that \"rising prices create their own excitement.\"While \"people like to get in on things that have been rising in price,\" over time, \"that has not been the way to get rich.\"For Charlie Munger, it is \"peculiar to buy an asset which only will go really up if the world really goes to hell. It doesn't strike me as an entirely rational thing to do.\"Duracell 'Coppertops' hope to ease EV anxiety in the UKBerkshire Hathaway's Duracell subsidiary is bringing its famous \"Coppertop\" battery brand to EV charging stations in the United Kingdom.According to a news release, it has granted a license to Elektra Charge to set up and run a Duracell E-Charge network featuring chargers that resemble its 9-volt batteries.The stations will be developed and funded by The EV Network (EVN), which calls itself Britain's \"leading charging infrastructure developer.\"The Times of London quotes Mark Bloxham, EVN's chief development officer, as saying the Duracell brand will give \"familiarity and trust immediately to the consumer\" when switching to an electric car.EVN's CEO Reza Shaybani tells the Times, \"When you're a little child, with your toy car, you use a Duracell battery.

    "body": "Mark Carney, Canada's prime minister, after speaking in Quebec City, Quebec, Canada, on Thursday, Jan. 22, 2026. Bloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesCanada has \"no intention\" of pursuing a free trade deal with China, Prime Minister Mark Carney said, after U.S. President Donald Trump threatened to slap punitive tariffs on Ottawa.Speaking to reporters on Sunday, Carney said that the country respects its obligations under the Canada-U.S.-Mexico trade agreement, known as CUSMA in Canada and the USMCA in the U.S., and will not pursue a free trade agreement without notifying the other two parties. Carney's remarks come after Trump threatened to put a 100% tariff on Canadian exports if Ottawa \"makes a deal\" with Beijing. \"If Governor Carney thinks he is going to make Canada a 'Drop Off Port' for China to send goods and products into the United States, he is sorely mistaken,\" Trump posted on Truth Social Saturday.The remarks come against the backdrop of rising tensions between the U.S. and Canada, with Trump last week withdrawing the invitation to Ottawa to join his \"Board of Peace,\" after Carney in his address at the World Economic Forum in Davos warned against economic coercion by the world's superpowers.While Carney did not name any country, Trump said on the sidelines of the WEF that \"Canada lives because of the United States. Remember that, Mark, the next time you make your statements.\"    Trump's fiery rhetoric on Truth Social contrasts with what he said after the agreement between Ottawa and Beijing earlier this month, \"that's what he [Carney] should be doing. It's a good thing for him to sign a trade deal. If you can get a deal with China, you should do that.\" Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent also echoed Trump's sentiments on Canada and China, telling ABC News on Sunday that the U.S could not \"let Canada become an opening that the Chinese pour their cheap goods into the U.S.\"On Jan. 16, Ottawa and Beijing concluded a \"preliminary agreement,\"  with both sides lowering tariffs on select goods. Under the agreement, Canada will allow 49,000 Chinese electric vehicles into the market annually at a lowered tariff rate of 6.1%, after raising tariffs on such vehicles to 100% in October 2024 in conjunction with the U.S. In return, Beijing will cut duties on Canadian agricultural exports, including on canola seed oil, which will see tariffs drop to 15% from March 1, down from the current 85%. Other exports, such as Canadian canola meal, lobsters, crabs, and peas will also not be subject to Chinese anti-discrimination tariffs until at least the end of 2026.Carney said Sunday: \"What we have done with China is to rectify some issues that have developed in the last couple of years,\" adding that the deal was \"entirely consistent with CUSMA.\"In August 2025, Trump raised tariffs on Canadian goods to 35% from 25%. Duties aren't imposed on most Canadian exports under CUSMA, but some goods, including steel, copper and certain autos and auto parts, are subject to U.S. tariffs.— CNBC's Terri Cullen contributed to this report.

    "body": "Gold notched another record high on Friday, while silver and platinum also extended gains to hit all-time peaks, driven by reduced confidence in U.S. assets.Nurphoto | Nurphoto | Getty ImagesGold climbed to a fresh all-time high, crossing $5,100 an ounce on Monday and extending its record-breaking run as investors seek the safety of the yellow metal amid rising geopolitical tensions and global fiscal risks.Spot gold prices gained 2.4%, trading at $5,102 an ounce, before slightly paring gains to last trade at $5,086. Meanwhile, U.S. gold futures for February rose 2.1%, reaching $5,087 an ounce. The precious metal's surge comes as recent flashpoints from Greenland and Venezuela to the Middle East underscore higher geopolitical risk, reinforcing gold's appeal as a hedge against uncertainty.\"The recent further leg up in gold and silver prices has arrived on the back of geoeconomics issues related to Greenland,\" HSBC wrote in a note last week.Silver also rallied Monday, with spot prices jumping 4.9% to $107.9 per ounce, also benefiting from industrial demand.Analysts at Union Bancaire Privée said Friday that prices have rallied on the back of sustained demand from both institutional and retail buyers.watch now\"We anticipate that gold should enjoy another strong year, reflecting ongoing central bank and retail investment demand, with a year-end target price of USD 5,200 per ounce,\" UBP said.Goldman Sachs sees the demand base for gold to have broadened beyond traditional channels. Western ETF holdings have climbed by about 500 tonnes since the start of 2025, while newer instruments used to hedge macro-policy risks, including physical purchases by high-net-worth families, have become an increasingly important source of demand.The investment bank recently lifted its December 2026 gold price forecast to $5,400 an ounce, up from $4,900 previously, arguing that hedges against global macro and policy risks have become \"sticky,\" effectively lifting the starting point for gold prices this year.Central bank purchases also remain robust. Goldman estimates central-bank purchases are now averaging around 60 tonnes a month, far above the pre-2022 average of 17 tonnes, with emerging-market central banks continuing to shift reserves into gold.Crucially, the bank assumes that hedges against global macro-policy risks, including concerns around fiscal sustainability, will remain in place through 2026, unlike election-related hedges that unwound quickly after the U.S. vote in late 2024.\"We assume that hedges of global macro policy risks remain stable as these perceived risks (e.g. fiscal sustainability) may not fully resolve in 2026,\" Goldman said last week.",

    "body": "Dado Ruvic | ReutersThe European Commission on Monday said it opened an investigation into Elon Musk's X over the spreading of sexually explicit material by the AI chatbot Grok. The probe is being conducted under the European Union's sweeping Digital Services Act (DSA) regulation. \"The new investigation will assess whether the company properly assessed and mitigated risks associated with the deployment of Grok's functionalities into X in the EU,\" the Commission, the EU's executive arm, said in a statement.\"This includes risks related to the dissemination of illegal content in the EU, such as manipulated sexually explicit images, including content that may amount to child sexual abuse material.\"The Commission said the risks \"seem to have materialised, exposing citizens in the EU to serious harm.\"Grok came under fire this year after users were able to prompt the system to generate sexualized images of children and other individuals.Earlier this month, Musk's company said it had \"implemented technological measures\" to prevent the Grok account on X \"from allowing the editing of images of real people in revealing clothing such as bikinis.\" The company also limited image creation editing through Grok on X to paid subscribers. The standalone Grok app, which does not share images publicly, still allowed on-paying users to generate imagery of women and children.European regulators have joined a growing list of authorities looking into Grok. The U.K., India, and Malaysia are among a number of other countries investigating the sexualized imagery generated by Grok. X has been in the crosshairs of the European Commission under the DSA, which gives the regulator the ability to levy large fines on tech companies. The DSA is designed to regulate online platforms, their content, and behavior with consumers. On Monday, the Commission said it is extending an investigation that began in 2023 into X and its recommendation system. In December, the Commission fined X 120 million euros ($142.3 million) for breaching its transparency obligations under the DSA. - CNBC's Lora Kolodny contributed to this report. ",

New York, U.S., January 25, 2026.Anadolu | Anadolu | Getty ImagesU.S. natural gas prices surged above $6 for the first time since late 2022 on Monday as a huge winter storm swept across the country, leaving hundreds of thousands without power and forcing mass flight cancellations.Natural gas futures for February delivery traded 17.7% higher, or 93 cents, to $6.21 per million British thermal units at 11:46 a.m. London time (6:46 a.m. ET), notching a new 52-week high.It is the first time the contract, which is up around 68% year-to-date, has climbed above the $6 level since Dec. 2022, when European demand for U.S. liquefied natural gas soared following Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine earlier in the year. More than 822,000 customers were left without power in the wake of a massive winter storm late Sunday afternoon, according to PowerOutage.us, which collects real-time power outage data from utilities nationwide.The big freeze, known as Winter Storm Fern, was forecast to bring widespread heavy snow and \"catastrophic ice accumulations\" from the southern Rocky Mountains to New England through the weekend, according to the National Weather Service (NWS), affecting at least 180 million people in 37 states. Wind chills as low as -50 degrees Fahrenheit (-45.56 degrees Celsius) will persist across the eastern two-thirds of the U.S. this week, the NWS said in a social media post on Sunday, with temperatures far below normal expected to continue into early February.  The extreme cold has been blamed for the deaths of seven people nationwide, NBC News reported, citing local officials. More than 12,500 flights were canceled in the U.S. on Sunday, FlightAware reported, with a further 3,965 canceled so far on Monday. Delta Air Lines, which had previously urged travelers to rebook flights, said Sunday that it intended to operate a reduced schedule as icy conditions disrupted operations.An American Airlines plane at LaGuardia Airport (LGA) during a winter storm in the Queens borough of New York, US, on Sunday, Jan. 25, 2026.Bloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesThe U.S. Department of Energy on Monday issued two emergency orders to mitigate blackouts in New England and Texas, seeking to keep grids stable and minimize the risk of blackouts.\"As Winter Storm Fern brings extreme cold and dangerous conditions across the country, maintaining affordable, reliable, and secure power is non-negotiable,\" U.S. Secretary of Energy Chris Wright said in a statement on Monday.

    "body": "C.C. Wei, CEO of TSMC, and Jensen Huang, CEO of Nvidia, interact on stage during TSMC’s annual sports day in Hsinchu, Taiwan, Nov. 8, 2025. Ann Wang | ReutersWhen Jensen Huang first met Morris Chang decades ago, he told the founder of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company that one day Nvidia would be the chip foundry's biggest customer. That's a story Huang, Nvidia's CEO, was asked about on a recent podcast, and it's a promise that is on track to be realized this year. Nvidia will become TSMC's largest customer this year, according to analyst estimates and Huang himself. Apple is believed to currently be TSMC's largest customer, mostly to manufacture A-series chips for iPhones and M-series chips for PCs and servers.The positional swap will mark a fundamental shift in the semiconductor industry, reflecting Nvidia's growing importance amid the AI infrastructure buildout.On the podcast published this month, Huang said that switch has already happened.\"Morris will be happy to know Nvidia is TSMC's largest customer now,\" said Huang, adding that he was personally very happy about the milestone. Creative Strategies chief analyst Ben Bajarin said he projects Nvidia to generate $33 billion in TSMC revenue this year, or about 22% of the chip foundry's total. Apple, by comparison, is projected to generate about $27 billion, or about 18% of TSMC's revenue. \"The scale of this drastically changed,\" Bajarin said. \"A couple years ago, you could just see how much more capacity Nvidia was demanding from TSMC.\"Nvidia and TSMC declined to comment. Apple didn't respond to a request for comment. Apple reports first-quarter earnings on Thursday, and the company is forecasting as much as 12% revenue growth in the quarter.watch nowTSMC doesn't discuss the ranking of its 522 customers, although it said in March that its top 10 customers made up 76% of the company's net revenue, adding that its largest customer at the time accounted for 22% of its net revenue. The second-largest customer accounted for 12% of net revenue. Nvidia's impact is apparent in the chip foundry's financials. TSMC's HPC sales, which include Nvidia's AI chips, made up 55% of net revenue in fourth-quarter earnings that were reported earlier this month. That was up from 40% in 2022, the year the AI boom kicked off with the launch of OpenAI's ChatGPT. AI accelerators, which are currently dominated by Nvidia, made up \"high-teens\" of TSMC's total 2025 sales. Nvidia's sales are rising quickly and outpacing Apple's growth. In February, Nvidia is expected to report 66% growth to $213 billion in sales in its fiscal 2026, which ends this month. Apple's growth in its fiscal 2025, ended in September, was 6.4%. Additionally, Nvidia's AI chips are bigger and more complicated to produce than what Apple manufactures, which means they cost more. The shift also highlights TSMC's role as the largest contract supply foundry in the world, providing chip manufacturing and related services to nearly every processor maker, including Advanced Micro Devices, Intel, Broadcom and Qualcomm.TSMC has an estimated 70% of the total market for chip manufacturing revenue, according to market researcher TrendForce. Although rival Intel has said it wants to make leading node chips in the U.S., it has yet to announce an anchor customer, and on Thursday, the company saw its stock plunge 13% after reporting soft first-quarter guidance and production concerns.A TSMC logo is displayed on a wall in Hsinchu, Taiwan April 15, 2025. Ann Wang | ReutersHuang understands the importance of TSMC's supply to Nvidia. He visited Taiwan five times last year. In November, he attended the foundry's annual sports day while wearing the same red shirt as TSMC employees. On that trip, he also reportedly visited TSMC's fab equipped with the 3 nanometer technology used to produce Nvidia's Rubin chip, which is in full production and expected to ship later this year. TSMC's latest quarterly results showed how the company's business is being transformed by the demand for AI chips. Company executives said they were weighing increased investment into additional factories, but were acting cautiously. For the December quarter, TSMC reported $33.73 billion in net revenue, up 21% on an annual basis, and projected 30% growth in sales this year. The strong forecast is driven by TSMC's success in AI chips, which the company expects to grow at a \"mid-to-high-fifties\" compound growth rate through 2029.\"Our customers' customer, who are mainly the cloud service providers, are also providing strong signals and reaching out directly to request the capacity to support their business,\" TSMC CEO C.C. Wei said, according to a company transcript. \"Thus, our conviction in the multi-year AI mega-trend remains strong.\"TSMC said it planned to spend as much as $56 billion on capital expenditures this year and expects to increase that to capture AI demand, adding that investments made this year would come online in 2028. Still, the company remains conservative about long-term projections that can span five years into the future. \"I'm also very nervous about it, you bet,\" Wei said when asked about an AI bubble, according to the transcript. \"Because we have to invest about $52 billion to $56 billion for the CapEx, right?\"Tim Cook, chief executive officer of Apple Inc., left, shares a toast with Morris Chang, founder of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC), during a \"First Tool-In\" ceremony at the TSMC facility under construction in Phoenix, Arizona, US, on Tuesday, Dec. 6, 2022.Caitlin O'Hara | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesTSMC and Apple have had a close relationship because of the volume of iPhone chips, which are smaller than AI GPUs and therefore less expensive per unit. The stability of that relationship allowed TSMC to aggressively invest in new capacity for cutting-edge technologies, which are called the \"leading nodes.\"Apple wanted the latest production nodes because the more advanced the manufacturing process, the more power-efficient the chip can be, improving device battery life. But power efficiency on the latest nodes is also important to Nvidia. That's because energy is an input into the return on investment on its AI systems. \"It just changes the dynamic where what was the driving force for TSMC — Apple — now shifts to Nvidia, and to some degree AMD, which is sort of the guarantee-scale customer that helps you justify the increase in CapEx to each new node,\" Bajarin said. Apple will still need lots of chips from TSMC, but on the Taiwanese company's earnings call earlier this month, the only customer whose product names were mentioned was Nvidia. \"My customers, their product improvements continue to increase,\" Wei said. \"It's well-known from Hopper to Blackwell to Rubin — that almost doubles, triples their performance.\"Wei added that, from his point of view, the bottleneck in the AI industry remains \"TSMC's wafer supply.\"",

    "body": "An undated handout image of Alex Pretti, who was fatally shot by U.S. immigration agents as they tried to detain him in Minneapolis, Minnesota, obtained by Reuters on Jan. 25, 2026.U.S. Department Of Veterans Affairs | Via ReutersMajor Minnesota business leaders on Sunday called for an \"immediate deescalation of tensions\" after federal immigration agents fatally shot U.S. citizen Alex Pretti in Minneapolis.More than 60 CEOs of Minnesota-based companies signed a letter urging \"state, local and federal officials to work together to find real solutions.\" The companies said that the recent tumult in Minnesota has caused \"widespread disruption and tragic loss of life.\"Among the signatories to the letter released by the Minnesota Chamber of Commerce are incoming Target CEO Michael Fiddelke; William Brown, the chairman and CEO of 3M; Brian Sikes, the chair and CEO of food giant Cargill; and Stephen Hemsley, the CEO of UnitedHealth.\"In this difficult moment for our community, we call for peace and focused cooperation among local, state and federal leaders to achieve a swift and durable solution that enables families, businesses, our employees, and communities across Minnesota to resume our work to build a bright and prosperous future,\" the letter reads. Other signatories include the Minnesota Vikings, Mayo Clinic, General Mills, Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Minnesota, Hormel, Medtronic, U.S. Bancorp, and Xcel Energy.The letter did not specifically name President Donald Trump or any other political leader involved with the situation in Minnesota. Executives across the country have been largely reluctant to comment publicly on political issues throughout Trump's second term.It does, however, say that \"representatives of Minnesota's business community have been working every day behind the scenes with federal, state and local officials to advance real solutions.\"\"These efforts have included close communication with the Governor, the White House, the Vice President and local mayors. There are ways for us to come together to foster progress,\" the letter reads. Minnesota is home to 17 Fortune 500 companies, according to the state's government. The state ranks fifth in Fortune 500 concentration per capita. The letter comes one day after federal officers shot and killed Pretti, a 37-year old intensive care unit nurse in Minneapolis.The Trump administration has surged federal law enforcement to the city to enforce its immigration crackdown and pursue allegations of widespread welfare fraud in the state. Read more CNBC politics coverageAlex Pretti killing: Minnesota CEOs, including UnitedHealth, Target, call for 'immediate deescalation'After Minneapolis shooting, government hurtles toward shutdown over DHS fundingTrump threatens to impose 100% tariff if Canada makes deal with ChinaTrump withdraws 'Board of Peace' invitation to Carney in widening riftHouse passes final funding bills 8 days before shutdown, Senate now will considerGreenland PM: Trump-NATO deal framework unclear, sovereignty is a red lineTrump sues Jamie Dimon, JPMorgan Chase over debanking the suit calls 'political'Trump says he reached Greenland deal 'framework' with NATO, backs off tariffsTrump interview live updates: CNBC's Joe Kernen sits down with the president at DavosPretti's killing is the latest incident in a tense standoff between Minnesota authorities and federal immigration officials that has prompted unrest in the region. An Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer shot and killed Renee Nicole Good, a U.S. citizen, earlier this month. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, a Democrat, has repeatedly called on the Trump administration to withdraw federal law enforcement from the state. The administration has resisted those calls and blamed the state's Democratic leadership for not assisting its efforts. \"President Trump, you can end this today,\" Walz said at a Sunday news conference. \"Pull these folks back, do humane, focused, effective immigration control, you've got the support of all of us to do that.\"Meanwhile, Gregory Bovino, the commander of the Border Patrol operation in Minnesota, doubled down on the federal government's actions. \"Our title eight immigration mission continues unabated here in Minneapolis despite yesterday's tragedy that was preventable by folks making better choices, politicians, journalists and would-be anarchists and rioters,\" Bovino said.This is breaking news.

    "body": "U.S. President Donald Trump (R) listens as NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte speaks during a bilateral meeting on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum (WEF) Annual Meeting on Jan. 21, 2026 in Davos, Switzerland. Chip Somodevilla | Getty ImagesEurope and U.S. relations are facing their \"lowest moment\" since NATO came into being, former European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso said, as Washington's disruptive approach to diplomacy forces allies to reexamine the transatlantic relationship. \"There are some doubts about the relationship with the United States,\" Barroso, also former prime minister of Portugal, said in an interview with CNBC's \"The China Connection\" on Monday, pointing to a loss of trust that extends beyond the European Union to include the U.K. U.S. President Donald Trump's aim to acquire Greenland, a semi-autonomous territory of Denmark, including threats of possible military action and higher tariffs on European nations, has shaken confidence in the U.S. among European leaders and the public. The relationship between Europe and the U.S. has become increasingly driven by interests, shifting away from the traditional model of being based on shared \"democratic values,\" Barroso said, describing the moment as a \"rupture phase\" in which it remains unclear \"where we are going from now.\"While Trump pulled back from a maximalist position, ruling out the use of military force and retreating from his threat of imposing tariffs on European nations aimed at pressuring them to help the U.S. acquire the island, he is sticking with his aim of exerting control on the Arctic territory. In a social media post last week after a meeting with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte, Trump said there is \"the framework of a future deal\" on Greenland, without disclosing any details or whether Denmark had agreed to a deal. Rutte later said the issue of Greenland's ownership did not come up in his talks with Trump. Barroso described Trump as \"the great disruptor\" who is sometimes \"more tough with allies and friends, than with opponents.\"  Only 16% of Europeans view the U.S. as an ally that shares the same values, down from 21% in 2024, with a \"striking\" 20% seeing the U.S. as a rival or an enemy, according to a survey conducted in November by the European Council on Foreign Relations, an international think tank. That collapse of trust was stark in the U.K. which saw the share drop to 25%, from 37% a year earlier.   watch nowOn defense, European leaders have also accelerated efforts toward \"European sovereignty,\" Barroso said, as the Trump administration has piled on pressure over the bloc's defense spending. \"If you want to keep NATO, it will be a more Europeanized NATO,\" Barroso said, adding that Europe should not rely only on the Americans, but prioritize strengthening its own defense.   At the NATO Summit in The Hague last year, member states pledged to invest the equivalent of 5% of their economic output on defense and security spending by 2035, following months of pressure from Washington.   Barroso said that NATO was stronger than before Russia's invasion of Ukraine, pointing to Sweden and Finland joining the bloc and that the alliance is now operationally closer to Russia border. NATO has increased its military presence along its eastern flank following Moscow's invasion in Ukraine. While sounding pessimistic about the current state of Europe-U.S. relations, Barroso cautioned against calling it the end of the transatlantic alliance, saying the U.S. remains crucial to Europe's security.

    "body": "Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., speaks during the Senate Democrats' news conference in the U.S. Capitol on the deadline for the release of the Epstein files on Tuesday, Dec. 16, 2025.Bill Clark | CQ-Roll Call, Inc. | Getty ImagesChances for a partial shutdown of the U.S. government by the end of this week grew on Sunday due to outrage over federal immigration agents fatally shooting Alex Pretti in Minnesota, the second such incident this month.A growing chorus of Democratic senators warned that they will not vote for a massive $1.2 trillion package to fund federal government operations if it includes appropriations for the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees immigration enforcement efforts.On Sunday, a person familiar with the thinking of the Senate's Republican leadership told CNBC that they will not remove the DHS funding portion, despite that warning.\"Government funding expires at the end of the week, and Republicans are determined to not have another government shutdown,\" that person said.\"We will move forward as planned and hope Democrats can find a path forward to join us,\" they said.The House of Representatives on Thursday approved the funding package.Without Senate approval of the deal by Friday, the federal government will begin a partial shutdown.The funding package needs 60 votes to overcome the filibuster and pass the Senate. Republicans hold a 53-47 vote majority in the Senate, meaning Democratic support will be needed to pass the measure.The deadly shooting of Pretti, a 37-year-old ICU nurse who was a U.S. citizen, in Minneapolis on Saturday morning ignited already simmering concern among members of the Democratic caucuses in Congress about funding DHS. Democrats already were angry about the fatal shooting of Renee Good, a Minneapolis woman, by an ICE officer in that city on Jan. 7.\"Senate Democrats will not allow the current DHS funding bill to move forward,\" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said in a statement on Sunday.\"Senate Republicans have seen the same horrific footage that all Americans have watched of the blatant abuses of Americans by ICE in Minnesota,\" Schumer said. \"The appalling murders of Renee Good and Alex Pretti on the streets of Minneapolis must lead Republicans to join Democrats in overhauling ICE and CBP to protect the public,\" he said. \"People should be safe from abuse by their own government.\"Sen. Angus King of Maine told CBS's \"Face the Nation\" on Sunday, \"I can't vote for a bill that includes ICE [Immigration and Customs Enforcement] funding under these circumstances.\"\"Take up DHS by itself, let's have an honest negotiation, put some guardrails on what's going on, some accountability, and that would solve this problem,\" said King, one of two independents who caucuses with Democrats. \"We don't have to have a shutdown,\" he said.Read more CNBC politics coverageAlex Pretti killing: Minnesota CEOs, including UnitedHealth, Target, call for 'immediate deescalation'After Minneapolis shooting, government hurtles toward shutdown over DHS fundingTrump threatens to impose 100% tariff if Canada makes deal with ChinaTrump withdraws 'Board of Peace' invitation to Carney in widening riftHouse passes final funding bills 8 days before shutdown, Senate now will considerGreenland PM: Trump-NATO deal framework unclear, sovereignty is a red lineTrump sues Jamie Dimon, JPMorgan Chase over debanking the suit calls 'political'Trump says he reached Greenland deal 'framework' with NATO, backs off tariffsTrump interview live updates: CNBC's Joe Kernen sits down with the president at DavosKing played a key role in ending last year's 43-day shutdown.  He voted repeatedly to open the government during the last shutdown as his Democratic colleagues pushed for an extension of Obamacare subsidies.Members of the House, which went into a pre-scheduled recess after passing the bill, would have to return to approve any changes the Senate makes before the shutdown deadline. It is unclear whether Republicans who control the House can or would do so. Some Democrats were already opposed to the funding measure, which, in addition to DHS, includes appropriations for the departments of Defense, Health and Human Services, Labor, Housing and Urban Development, Transportation, Education, State, and Treasury. \"No, I am not voting for this funding,\" said Minnesota Democratic Sen. Amy Klobuchar on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" on Sunday. \"Our Republican colleagues have to stand up and stop this.\"The top Democrat on the Senate Appropriations Committee, Sen. Patty Murray of Washington, has also said she will oppose the package if it includes DHS funding. Murray warned earlier last week that the \"suggestion that a shutdown in this moment might curb the lawlessness of this administration is not rooted in reality.\"\"Federal agents cannot murder people in broad daylight and face zero consequences,\" Murray said on X Saturday.\"I will NOT support the DHS bill as it stands. The DHS bill needs to be split off from the larger funding package before the Senate — Republicans must work with us to do that,\" she said.It was unclear if the Senate could split the DHS portion off from the rest of the funding bill to minimize a partial shutdown. While the House passed the DHS bill separately from the rest of the bills, they were all tied together into one bill to be sent to the Senate, meaning the majority Republicans would need to support splitting the bill up. It remains possible that enough Democrats join with Republicans to pass the funding bill and avoid a shutdown. Many of the other agencies in the package are important to Democrats. DHS may also be less hindered during a shutdown if it taps the hundreds of billions of dollars that congressional Republicans injected into the agency as part of their \"One Big Beautiful Bill\" law passed last summer. But that is far from a guaranteed outcome. Several Democrats who joined with Republicans last year to end the record 43-day government shutdown have warned they will oppose the bill if it includes funding for DHS.\"I will not support the current Homeland Security funding bill,\" said Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto, D-Nev., who is one of the Democrats who joined Republicans to end the last shutdown.\"Let's pass the remaining five bipartisan bills and fund essential agencies while we continue to fight for a Department of Homeland Security that respects Americans' constitutional rights and preserves federal law enforcement's essential role to keep us safe.\"  Complicating matters further is a massive snowstorm over Washington, D.C., and wide stretches of the U.S. The Senate canceled votes on Monday due to the storm, shortening an already tight timeline to avoid a shutdown. — CNBC's Emily Wilkins contributed to this article.",

    "body": "Building a healthy romantic relationship takes time and intention. Over time, meaningful experiences, personal disclosures and authentic conversations create closeness and intimacy.To genuinely know someone, you must understand what matters to them — their likes and dislikes, passions, limits — and respecting those traits even when they differ from your own.In fact, many strong couples come to appreciate differences, recognizing that a person's history, quirks and tendencies are what make them unique. Here are eight phrases couples who are truly close use when talking about each other, and they should be relationship goals for all of us.1. 'They are who they are.'Your partner's mistakes aren't yours to carry, and their successes aren't yours to claim. They are their own person living alongside you, not an extension of you.Similar phrases:\"She's always been like that.\"\"I know that's one of his favorite things to do.\"2. 'I'm not surprised at all!'When you really understand your partner, you're not likely to be taken aback by what they say or do. If friends are shocked by a comment or action they make, you might just smile and shrug. Similar phrases: \"Oh yeah, that's my mate alright!\"\"That's totally her style.\"3. 'They're quirky like that.'Everyone has their own quirks, odd habits or routine preferences, from how they drink coffee to how they fold their towels. These are little things that no one else probably knows about them. But if you really know your partner, you notice those details and often find affection in them.Similar phrases:\"They sneeze like a train!\"\"His hiccups are kind of adorable.\"4. 'I trust them to be themselves.'Deep knowledge builds trust. When you know your partner, you trust them to act authentically and responsibly, whether you're together or apart.Similar phrases:\"She can be a little intense, but I trust her to make good choices.\"\"I know they'll be respectful.\" 5. 'That is a core value.'Intimacy means understanding your partner's fundamental ideas, beliefs and principles. Even when you disagree, you can acknowledge what truly matters to them without dismissing or demeaning it.Similar phrases:\"I know this is really important to them.\"\"He's very passionate about politics.\"6. 'They struggle with that.'Knowing someone deeply means understanding their fears, vulnerabilities and emotional triggers. When those struggles surface, you respond with empathy rather than judgment or defensiveness.Similar phrases:\"I know this is painful for them.\"\"I see her struggle and want to support her through it.\"7. 'I can't change them.'Knowing your partner means accepting that you can't — and shouldn't — try to change who they are, even if it's something you really dislike about them. True growth only happens if they choose it.Similar phrases:\"They'll change only if they want to.\"\"I accept that we see this differently, even if I don't like it.\" 8. 'I didn't know that about them!'Even in long-term relationships, there's always more to learn. When couples truly know each other, discovering something new feels like an opportunity to grow, not a threat.Similar phrases:\"I never realized they felt that way.\"\"Even though we've been married for years, I'm still learning new things about him.\"Want to get to know your partner better? Here are a few ways to start:Ask open-ended questions with genuine curiosity.Practice seeing situations from their perspective.Speak with respect during difficult conversations.Use physical touch, like hugging or holding hands, to bond.Show presence by putting down your phone, making eye contact and prioritizing time together.The answer to real intimacy is simple: You have to understand and choose each other, every day.Dr. Cortney S.

    "body": "U.S. President Donald Trump and CEO of Ford Jim Farley clap, as President Trump visits a Ford production center, in Dearborn, Michigan, U.S., January 13, 2026. Evelyn Hockstein | ReutersDETROIT — The only consistency has been inconsistency for the U.S. automotive industry during the first half of this decade — a trend that's expected to continue amid challenging market conditions in 2026.The U.S. auto sector — a crucial driver of the economy estimated around 4.8% of America's gross domestic product — has endured rolling crises since the Covid-19 pandemic shuttered U.S. assembly plants in early 2020. The global health crisis was followed by yearslong supply chain issues, semiconductor chip shortages, political whipsawing, tariffs and other challenges for all-electric and autonomous vehicles.Automakers have been surprisingly resilient during the challenges, but those issues are now combining with more traditional industry problems of affordability and slowing consumer demand. That's all creating a more challenging environment for automakers in 2026.\"We've got to plan for the worst and hope for the best,\" Hyundai North America CEO Randy Parker told CNBC during an interview. \"That's the situation that we're in right now.\"Other executives have expressed similar sentiments as they prepare for a \"new\" U.S. automotive industry: one that's more expensive, smaller and, by many means, less predictable.Automotive forecasters are calling for steady to lower sales this year, despite industry sales only hitting 16.3 million units last year. That was the highest level since the pandemic in 2020, but down from more than 17 million for five consecutive years before the global health crisis, according to industry data.\"Anyone in the auto industry … we should all be very careful about consumer demand,\" Ford Motor CEO Jim Farley said Jan. 13 during an event for the Detroit Auto Show. \"That's really important.\"'Affordability crisis'One of the largest industry issues — and one that's a culmination of many factors — is the affordability of new vehicles. New vehicles prices have climbed; the average transaction price was hovering around $50,000 toward the end of last year, up 30% from less than $38,747 to begin 2020, according to Cox Automotive.Average transaction prices historically increased on average 3.2% year-over-year, but from 2020-2022 that average nearly tripled to 9%.\"Pandemic-induced production constraints and supply chain chaos didn't just disrupt the market temporarily. They fundamentally restructured pricing dynamics. This elevated plateau is now the new baseline, which has the market anchored at these higher price points,\" said Erin Keating, Cox Automotive senior director of economic and industry insights.It's not just vehicle prices hitting consumers' wallets either. They're also dealing with inflation, increases in maintenance and repairs, and 13% annual average increases for insurance over the past five years, according to Cox Automotive.\"The cumulative weight of all these increases has pushed total vehicle ownership costs beyond reach for many middle- and lower-income households, constraining market access and accelerating the affordability crisis,\" said Cox Automotive interim chief economist Jeremy Robb. Cox Automotive reports it took 33.7 weeks of median household income to buy the average new vehicle in November 2019. Now it's 36.3 weeks. That's down from a record high of 42.2 weeks during the pandemic, but still means vehicles cost thousands of dollars more than historic levels.David Christ, Toyota Motor's U.S. sales chief, warned that the current tariff and trade environment will cause prices to continue to increase this year, despite the concerns.\"On our end, we're just taking it month-to-month, and we're watching the competitors closely,\" Christ said on a call with reporters earlier this month. \"But we feel prices are going to go up for us and for our competitors.\" To combat the slower sales and affordability challenges, Toyota and other automakers have said they will refocus on lower-priced vehicle models — a change from recent years when automakers prioritized their most expensive, highly profitable vehicles during supply chain shortages.\"Every automaker must face the reality that the American market has changed for the foreseeable future,\" said Lance Woelfer, head of American Honda Motor's U.S. sales.For Honda, Woelfer said that means increasing production on less expensive trims as well as focusing on certified pre-owned vehicles, which are used but backed by company warranties. For others, such as Ford, that could include reentering abandoned segments such as sedans, according to its CEO.\"Never say never,\" Farley told reporters during the event in Detroit. \"The sedan market is very vibrant. It's not that there isn't a market there. It's just we couldn't find a way to compete and be profitable. Well, we may find a way to do that.\"Ford sells sedans outside of the U.S. but exited the domestic market with the cancellation of the Michigan-made Fusion in 2020. It also eliminated the larger Taurus sedan and smaller Ford Fiesta and Ford Focus before that.Ford's crosstown rivals General Motors and Stellantis have largely exited the traditional U.S. sedan market as well.Affordability concerns are generating attention from outside the automotive industry as well. A Senate committee led by Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, requested a hearing with CEOs from Ford, GM and Stellantis about affordability and other issues in the automotive industry. The hearing was scheduled for Jan. 14 but was postponed amid scheduling conflicts and general pushback from Ford about Tesla CEO Elon Musk not attending the meeting, according to a letter from the company to the subcommittee that was obtained by Politico.2025 Jeep Grand Cherokees are displayed for sale at Larry H. Miller Chrysler, Jeep, Dodge and Ram dealership in Thornton, Colorado on Wednesday, Jan. 7, 2026. Hyoung Chang | The Denver Post | Getty Images'Prepared for surprises'Automakers are also bracing this year for potentially volatile U.S. regulations and trade negotiations, such as the upcoming renegotiating of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement that's scheduled for later this year.Currently, automakers can import new vehicles from South Korea or Japan with lower tariffs than from Canada or Mexico, depending on their U.S. content. The Trump administration has reached trade deals on vehicles with those Asian countries but not its neighbors to the north and south. Depending on the outcome of those discussions, USMCA could be a tailwind for automakers that have a lot of production in the U.S.\"Looking to 2026, our cycle work would suggest that autos would have a difficult time outperforming given a relatively flat y/y volume outlook. However, we see reasons for optimism for US [automakers],\" UBS analyst Joseph Spak wrote last month in an investor note. Wall Street will begin getting its first outlooks from automakers this week beginning with GM announcing its fourth quarter and year-end earnings on Tuesday, followed by Tesla on Wednesday. GM CEO Mary Barra earlier this month reconfirmed that the automaker expects 2026 will be better than 2025.  GM's 2025 guidance included adjusted earnings before interest and taxes of between $12 billion and $13 billion, or $9.75 to $10.50 adjusted EPS, and adjusted automotive free cash flow of $10 billion to $11 billion, up from $7.5 billion to $10 billion.But depending on the automaker, Wall Street analysts expect mixed results for the U.S. industry as it continues to deal with uncertain times.\"It is hard to imagine how 2026 could bring more external shocks and share price divergence than 2025 but, with no visible end to industry disruption, we are also prepared for surprises, impairments and strategic shifts,\" Jefferies analyst Owen Paterson said in an investor note this month.",

    "description": "On Saturday, Alex Pretti, a 37-year-old intensive care unit nurse and U.S. citizen, was shot and killed by federal immigration agents in Minneapolis. ",
    "body": "On Saturday, Alex Pretti, a 37-year-old intensive care unit nurse and U.S. citizen, was shot and killed by federal immigration agents in Minneapolis. There's a wide gap between what Americans have seen of the shooting and what federal officials are telling them.Soon after the shooting, Department of Homeland Security officials rushed to defend the officers involved, claiming the victim \"approached U.S. Border Patrol officers with a 9 mm semi-automatic handgun\" and that when federal agents attempted to disarm him, \"the suspect violently resisted.\"DHS Secretary Kristi Noem defended the Border Patrol agent who shot Pretti, saying in a news conference that the agent fired \"defensive\" shots after the victim violently brandished a gun. \"The officers attempted to disarm this individual, but the armed suspect reacted violently,\" Noem said.In a separate press conference, Border Patrol commander-at-large Greg Bovino claimed Pretti may have wanted to do \"maximum damage\" and \"massacre law enforcement.\"But videos taken by bystanders, filmed from several different angles, tell a different story. In the first video verified by CNBC, protestors can be heard honking their horns on an urban Minneapolis street, while the video's author records through a car windshield as the car moves.watch nowAt 15 seconds, the camera pans to the left to show a man on the side of the street wearing a brown jacket and tan pants (believed to be Alex Pretti) holding up what appears to be a phone while being confronted by two federal agents. Pretti steps backwards away from the confrontation while appearing to yell at an agent.  At 21 seconds, the person filming the video drives past the confrontation, and the camera swings to the other side of the street as someone in the car yells profanities.  In a second video verified by CNBC, protestors can be heard blowing whistles and honking their horns at federal agents in a video on a cold Minneapolis street. At seven seconds, the video shows a man dressed in tactical gear believed to be a federal agent shove a woman wearing a brown jacket and black leggings in the back near the side of the street. She doesn't fall but moves several feet away because of the shove.  watch nowThe camera briefly shifts to the middle of the street before going back to the confrontation on the side at 11 seconds. The agent is face-to-face with one woman wearing a long cream jacket and charcoal pants. Next to her is a man in a brown jacket and tan pants believed to be Pretti, and next to him is the woman in brown jacket, black leggings who was shoved seconds ago.  At 12 seconds in the second video, the agent shoves the woman wearing the cream jacket to the ground. Pretti puts himself between the agent and the woman, who is on her back in a snowbank on the side of the road. At 14 seconds, the agent starts spraying Pretti in the face with a chemical agent. Pretti covers his face and turns away from the officer. Other agents wearing vests approach the confrontation. At 22 seconds, several agents are struggling with Pretti, attempting to bring him to the ground. He appears to fall to the ground, and at 28 seconds you see one agent apparently swinging a punch at his head while Pretti is down.  At this point, bystanders are recording, and whistles are making noise constantly. By 38 seconds, at least six agents seem to have restrained the man believed to be Pretti on the ground.One agent appears to take a weapon from Pretti and quickly walks away while holding the gun. A gunshot is heard at 40 seconds. It is unclear if the man holding the gun fired the shot. Following the first shot, more gunshots are heard in quick succession.  In a third video verified by CNBC, taken by someone on the street near the incident, protestors are blowing whistles at federal agents. watch nowAt 25 seconds, a man wearing a brown jacket and tan pants believed to be Pretti is holding his hand up in the middle of the street. He waves a car past and then starts walking. The camera then shifts away for a moment to a snowbank. A protestor can be heard shouting, \"What is wrong with you?\" At 33 seconds into the third video, Pretti has his arm around a woman in a dark green jacket and black leggings, apparently attempting to help her. He steps in front of a federal agent closing in on a woman who is on her back in the snowbank on the side of the road.  At 40 seconds, Pretti has his hand up to a federal agent who is spraying him with some kind of chemical agent. Two agents drag him onto his back and more agents join in a circle around the man in tan pants. A struggle takes place on the ground, with six agents surrounding the man in tan pants. At 60 seconds, one of the agents can be seen stepping back from the confrontation and he draws his gun and points it at Pretti. At 1:01, a single shot can be heard, followed by several in quick succession. The man on the ground, Pretti, slumps down.Amid screams, at 1:04, another flurry of gunshots can be heard.At no point in any of the three videos shown here does Alex Pretti brandish a weapon or appear to threaten federal immigration agents before the confrontation begins, as was claimed by DHS Sec. Noem and others in the Trump administration. One video also appears to show a federal officer removing a weapon from Pretti while he's being restrained by agents on the ground before any shots are fired. Pretti is a lawful gun owner and owns a permit for his weapon.",

    "body": "Five years before Abi Caswell opened her own bakery, she had never made a single cookie. Today, she owns and manages two bake shops that bring in seven figures in sales, she says.Caswell, 30, is the founder of Batter, a bakery with two storefronts in Hammond, Louisiana and in New Orleans.Her ultimate goal has always been to own her own business, she tells CNBC Make It. \"Since I was a kid, I always knew I wanted to work for myself,\" she says. \"I wanted to be able to control my schedule, and I wanted to make my own money.\"Her interest in sweet treats began as a teenager: Caswell worked at a local cupcake shop from ages 16 to 20 and \"loved everything about it,\" though she wasn't involved in the baking process.After graduating from Louisiana State University of Alexandria in 2018 with a major in business administration and a minor in marketing, Caswell moved to Hammond with her husband Trey.While working full-time as an executive assistant, Caswell started experimenting with baking her own cakes as a hobby.After she made a cake for a friend's husband, \"one of our mutual friends was like, 'This is so good. You've got to sell these. We have nothing like this here,'\" Caswell recalls. Caswell initially planned to stick to cakes and cupcakes, she says, but with the rise of popular cookie chains like Crumbl and Insomnia Cookies — neither of which had storefronts in Hammond at the time, Caswell notes — she decided to capitalize on the craze and make cookies the focus of her baking side hustle.Courtesy of Abi CaswellFrom home baker to business owner In fall 2021, Caswell started experimenting with cookie recipes with the help of her husband Trey, who works as a high school basketball coach. It took Caswell six months to develop her now-signature chocolate chip cookie recipe.\"We made so many batches of cookies that were terrible,\" she says. \"They would just never be quite right because I had no clue what I was doing. So every time I made one, I just learned something new about it.\"She began posting her bakes online and on social media, and says she quickly attracted a strong local customer base.In spring 2022, Caswell left her full-time executive assistant job to focus on baking.\"I was going to work from 8 to 5:30 [p.m.], and then I was coming home and baking till like 1 a.m.,\" she recalls. \"It was just too much.\"Around the time Caswell left her job, she landed a spot at the farmer's market in Hammond. Every Friday, she baked 500 cookies with her husband's help to sell at the market on Saturday, and they regularly sold out within 30 minutes, she says.\"That was when I realized, we've got to get in a store. Like, this is not sustainable. We have to find another way to sell,\" Caswell says.The Batter storefront in Hammond, LA.Courtesy of Abi Caswell.It wasn't easy for Caswell to secure a storefront in Hammond. Caswell developed a business plan to open a bakery with the help of her local small business development center, but she had no money saved at the time and several banks rejected her request for a loan.Finally, a bank representative helped her secure a $40,000 loan, for which Caswell says she had to put up her house as collateral, to rent a storefront and install baking appliances. In November 2022, Caswell officially opened her first Batter shop in downtown Hammond with a team of eight employees — a head baker and seven part-time bakery clerks. She had just turned 27 years old.Scaling the businessCaswell was \"running off adrenaline\" for the first few months, she says. She spent up to 18 hours a day working at the bakery to keep up with demand.\"We couldn't keep anything in stock,\" she says. \"We had an amazing time, but it was very, very stressful.\" Batter brought in mid-six figures in its first year of operation, according to Caswell, and she was able to pay off her bank loan entirely by May 2023.After the success of the Hammond location, Caswell opened another Batter location in New Orleans in December 2024 with the goal of reaching a larger customer base.Last year, the two locations collectively brought in seven figures in yearly sales, according to documents reviewed by CNBC Make It.Some of Caswell's cookie creationsCourtesy of Abi CaswellCaswell estimates that she sells over a thousand baked goods each day. Cookies, cupcakes, cakes, petit fours and pull-apart loaves are staples on Batter's menu year-round, she says, but they also offer seasonal treats like a king cake-inspired cookie for Mardi Gras. The bakery's signature chocolate chip cookies cost $3.75 each.Batter also sells cake balls, croissants and homemade pop tarts that Caswell sources from other local women-owned bakeries, and both locations serve coffee.Right now, Caswell is close to achieving a longtime dream: developing her signature chocolate chip cookie recipe into a wholesale mix.She says her first drop of 150 bags of cookie mix, which she sells for $14.99 each, quickly sold out online, and her goal is to get the product into grocery stores this year.\"Before I ever opened Batter, I always said to my husband, 'We're going to be on these shelves one day,'\" she says.Developing a mix will make her cookies \"more accessible,\" rather than being tied to a storefront, Caswell says.'Never truly off the clock'One trait that Caswell believes is crucial to her success is adaptability.\"A lot of being a business owner is what your tolerance level is for your plans to change, for things to pop up and things to go wrong,\" she says.Running both bakeries hasn't been easy – \"every day there's something new going on,\" Caswell says.Caswell currently doesn't have a cake decorator for the New Orleans store, so she's filling the position herself until she can hire a new decorator.Caswell typically splits her time between both stores, which are an hour's drive apart, but since her New Orleans store is understaffed, Caswell has been working at that location \"pretty much full-time\" every day of the week, she says. That's the \"joy of being a small business owner,\" she jokes: you're \"never truly off the clock.\"Caswell holds a bag of her signature chocolate chip cookie mix.Courtesy of Abi CaswellOnline marketing has always been a key element of her business, Caswell says: it's how she reached many of her early customers, and she credits her social media reach for boosting her business to this day.Caswell currently has almost 300,000 followers on her TikTok account, where she posts about her daily routine, shares behind-the-scenes baking videos and opens up about the challenges of running her bakeries.Beyond promoting her bakes, Caswell's goal is to show her audience what it really takes to run a small business.\"I try to be as honest as I can be on social media,\" she says. \"I really think that people don't understand the mental undertaking, but also the time commitment.\" When you own a business, \"there is no real downtime,\" Caswell says. \"Even when I'm on vacation, if the stores are open, I'm on the clock.\"Most of the time, \"the losses hurt more than the wins feel good,\" she continues, but Caswell's goal for this year is to give herself a chance \"to relish what we've done.\"Want to get ahead at work with AI?

    "body": "watch nowSoon, parents and guardians can open a Trump account for their children — and a number of large employers are piling on the incentives to get set up. For starters, babies born in 2025 through 2028 may receive a one-time $1,000 contribution from the Department of the Treasury. There are no income requirements, and all U.S. families are eligible for the initial seed money. But, in some cases, that is just the half of it. To help fund these savings accounts from the outset, a growing list of companies, including SoFi, Charter Communications, BNY, BlackRock, Investment Company Institute, Robinhood and Charles Schwab, announced they will match the federal $1,000 contribution for employees' children.

Children 10 or under and born before Jan. 1, 2025, — who wouldn't qualify for the $1,000 initial deposit from the Treasury — could get a $250 contribution thanks to a $6.25 billion pledge made by tech CEO Michael Dell and his wife, Susan. Children in Connecticut may qualify for an additional donation from billionaire hedge fund manager Ray Dalio and his wife, Barbara. Philanthropists in other states could follow suit as part of a \"50-state challenge,\" Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said at a White House press conference last month. As it stands, those additional donations are geared toward families who live in a ZIP code where the median income is less than $150,000. How to set up a Trump accountTrump accounts, also known as Section 530A accounts, were created to encourage early wealth building as part of President Donald Trump's \"big beautiful bill,\" which Congress passed in July.To open the account, an election must be made on IRS Form 4547, named for Trump's presidential terms. The form also includes a check box for the $1,000 Treasury contribution for children born between 2025 and 2028.   Form 4547 can be filed separately or with your 2025 tax return as soon as Jan. 26, which marks the official start of the 2026 tax filing season. Later in the year, this election can also be made via Trumpaccounts.gov.Once an account is established, parents, guardians, grandparents and others can contribute up to $5,000 a year in after-tax dollars up until the year before the beneficiary turns 18. The annual contribution limit adjusts for inflation after 2027.As part of the $5,000 limit, employers can contribute up to $2,500 per worker per year, which won't count as taxable income, according to the IRS. This figure also adjusts for inflation after 2027.Qualifying charitable organizations and state and local governments can also make contributions that do not count toward the $5,000 limit.How much a Trump account may be worthExperts say the additional Trump account contributions could make a difference over time. For example, let's say a family receives $1,000 from the Treasury and a $1,000 matching contribution from their employer for a total of $2,000 during their baby's first year.That account could be worth about $6,800 after 18 years, assuming 7% annual returns, according to certified financial planner Ivory Johnson, founder of Delancey Wealth Management in Washington. He is also a member of CNBC's Financial Advisor Council.Many experts encourage families to accept \"free money\" from the Treasury, an employer or other sources. But beyond that, families can also weigh other investing options, such as 529 college savings plans and taxable brokerage accounts, among others, depending on their goals and timeline.

    "body": "Hong Kong's stock exchange reported its highest quarterly profit in nearly four years after China's stimulus measures boosted trading and listing volume.Bloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesHONG KONG — The boom in initial public offerings in Hong Kong has offered a long-awaited release valve for private equity firms sitting on aging China portfolios, top fund executives said at an industry panel Tuesday. After years of muted dealmaking and frozen exits, the opportunity to list in Hong Kong at attractive valuations has lifted sentiment, with companies raising $18.2 billion via IPOs this year as of October, putting the financial hub on track to become the world's largest listing destination this year. The rebound in Hong Kong-listed stocks — the Hang Seng Index is up more than 28% so far this year, outperforming the S&P 500 with less than 13% gains — has further buoyed confidence.Global private equity firms are cautiously turning bullish on China after spending the past few years on the sidelines. Cheaper valuations and hopes that domestic consumer confidence could start recovering are drawing investors back to the world's second-largest economy.\"In consumer-investing in China, you effectively have an opportunity to buy growth at a discount,\" said Scott Chen, managing partner at global private equity firm L Catterton, citing the rapid rise of domestic brands and massive household savings.\"The worst is behind us and consumer confidence is starting to turn,\" Chen added, expecting consumers will increasingly favor homegrown brands. Echoing that sentiment, Nikhil Srivastava, partner and co-head of private equity at alternative investment firm PAG, said that Chinese assets have become more attractive as many global players have pulled back, reducing competition. \"What that means is that you can buy market-leading assets very cheap. These are high-quality, domestic consumption-driven assets that you can buy at pretty attractive multiples,\" Srivastava added. The shift in positioning follows years in which global allocators harbored an \"anything but China\" mindset, according to Tim Huang, partner at U.S.-based Lexington Partners. \"The investment sentiment really swung from one way to the other [when] the truth lies somewhere in the middle.\"  The opportunity in China remains compelling for investors with discipline and long-term commitment, Huang added. Narrow IPO window? Returns to investors in the form of distribution of profits from the portfolio companies has helped mitigate some investor concerns in the absence of exits. \"While the exit market might be a little bit challenged, when you are getting paid 15-20% cash-on-cash returns, assuming no growth — and if there's growth, you generate more cash — clearly you are getting paid to wait,\" Srivastava said. Still, the surge in IPO activity in Hong Kong is particularly significant for China-focused PE fund managers that have struggled to exit investments since 2021 as they search for better returns. With corporate mergers and acquisitions still sluggish and domestic Chinese listings tightly regulated, Hong Kong offers a much-needed outlet. But experts have warned that the backlog of applications could delay plans to exit and take advantage of the momentum around Hong Kong-listed stocks.More than 300 IPO applications were still under processing as of end-October, according to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, compared to less than 70 that were pending approval in the same period last year. Wu Qing, head of China Securities Regulatory Commission, last month reiterated the regulator's pledges to streamline processes for Chinese firms to list abroad and deepen the financial link between the mainland and Hong Kong. As Hong Kong's markets recover, \"we do believe that the growth will accelerate and then opportunities to exit will also go up,\" translating to stronger returns for private equity, Srivastava said.

Bitcoin is up 2% over the past year, according to Coin Metrics.The move comes as investors have shed their AI-related tech holdings this month in the stock market.

    "body": "Regent Street in London celebrates the Christmas season on November 13, 2025 in London, England. Ben Montgomery | Getty Images Entertainment | Getty ImagesThe U.K.'s inflation rate cooled to 3.6% in October, marking one of the last major economic data releases ahead of the government's Autumn Budget next week.Economists polled by Reuters had expected a rate of 3.6% in the twelve months to October, down from 3.8% in September.Core inflation, excluding energy, food, alcohol and tobacco, rose by 3.4% in the year to October, down from 3.5% in September, according to the latest figures from the Office for National Statistics. \"Inflation eased in October, driven mainly by gas and electricity prices, which increased less than this time last year following changes in the Ofgem energy price cap. The costs of hotels was also a downward driver, with prices falling this month,\" Grant Fitzner, chief economist at the ONS, commented Wednesday.These downward pressures were only partially offset by rising food prices, following the dip seen in September, while the annual cost of raw materials for business continued to increase.Responding to the latest data, U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer Rachel Reeves said \"this fall in inflation is good news for households and businesses across the country, but I'm determined to do more to bring prices down.\" \"That's why at the budget next week I will take the fair choices to deliver on the public's priorities to cut NHS waiting lists, cut national debt and cut the cost of living,\" she said, in comments released by the Treasury. Sterling was flat against both the U.S. dollar and the euro in the immediate aftermath of the release. Meanwhile, yields on U.K. government bonds — known as gilts — were marginally lower across the maturity curve.The U.K. government has the highest long-term borrowing costs of any G-7 nation, with the yield on its 30-year gilt trading well above the critical 5% threshold.Budget then Christmas cutThe Bank of England had previously forecast that inflation would peak at 4% — double the central bank's target — in September, before gradually cooling into next year.Economists expect the central bank will cut interest rates at its next meeting in December, as inflation cools and growth remains stubbornly low; the U.K. economy grew a meager 0.1% in the third quarter, preliminary figures released last week showed.For now, however, all eyes are on the U.K. Treasury's Autumn Budget, which will be announced on Nov. 26, with analysts looking to see the extent of expected tax rises, which could be disinflationary.\"Looking ahead, the Autumn Budget will likely mark the next most important inflation forecast update. Speculation around lower energy bills, indexation costs, duties, and food prices remain rife,\" Sanjay Raja, chief U.K. economist at Deutsche Bank, said in analysis ahead of the inflation data.\"We expect the Chancellor to push through some modest measures to pull down on prices come 26 November. This will give us a good sense of where 2026 inflation will land,\" he said.Relief for ReevesThe latest inflation reading will provide \"much-needed positive relief\" for Reeves, according to Brad Holland, director of investment strategy at J.P. Morgan Personal Investing.\"While a slowing rate of price rises will be welcome news to many – not least of all UK consumers preparing for their festive spending – the U.K. economic picture remains mixed,\" he said in emailed comments. Holland said the latest inflation data would likely push the central bank toward a pre-Christmas cut when it meets on Dec. 18.\"With the latest data following lack lustre growth figures out last week, the calls that action is needed are getting louder by the day. Markets are pricing in an 80% chance of a 0.25% interest rate cut in December, and the data is suggesting the time has probably come,\" he said.Chancellor Rachel Reeves poses with the red box outside number 11 Downing Street on October 30, 2024 in London, England. This is the first Budget presented by the new Labour government and Chancellor of the Exchequer, Rachel Reeves. Dan Kitwood | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesGeorge Brown, senior economist at Schroders, said that while the latest data tipped the scales toward a December rate cut, any further rate cuts will largely depend on the contents of the Chancellor's red box. \"If VAT and green levies are eliminated from household energy bills, inflation could fall by as much as half a percentage point,\" he said in emailed comments.\"But we remain concerned that broader price pressures will prove persistent. Wage growth is still well above a target-consistent pace, especially given repeatedly weak productivity. The Bank [of England] must tread carefully given the heightened risk that high inflation becomes entrenched.\"",

Nathan Howard | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesPresident Donald Trump on Tuesday called for ABC's broadcast license to be revoked as he angrily lashed out at a reporter from the network who asked why he has not released files on notorious sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, his former friend.\"I think you are a terrible reporter,\" Trump told ABC News White House correspondent Mary Bruce.The president said he did not like Bruce's \"attitude.\"\"You ought to go back and learn how to be a reporter. No more questions from you,\" Trump said in the Oval Office, where he was meeting with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman of Saudi Arabia.Trump's tirade came shortly before the House of Representatives voted overwhelmingly in favor of a bill to compel the Department of Justice to release all of its records on Epstein.The DOJ earlier this year refused to release those documents, despite prior promises by Attorney General Pam Bondi and other Trump administration officials.Trump does not need to wait for Congress to pass a bill. He could order the DOJ to release more Epstein files.\"Why wait for Congress to release the Epstein files?\" Bruce asked the president. \"Why not just do it now?\"Trump said, \"As far as the Epstein files ...

Because your news is so fake and so wrong.\"\"We have a great commissioner ... who should look at that,\" he added, apparently referring to Federal Communications Commission Chair Brendan Carr, whose agency oversees broadcast licenses.In September, Carr threatened ABC's license over comments by late-night show Jimmy Kimmel about the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk.\"We can do this the easy way or the hard way,\" said Carr on a podcast at the time. \"These companies can find ways to change conduct, to take action, frankly, on Kimmel, or you know, there's going to be additional work for the FCC ahead.\"Hours after Carr's remarks, ABC suspended \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\"The show returned to air about a week later after backlash against ABC and its parent company, Disney.Trump has repeatedly called the Epstein matter a \"hoax\" created by Democrats, even though members of Trump's Make America Great Again movement were leading advocates for releasing the files.And Trump failed to dissuade Republican allies in Congress from supporting the bill to release the files.On Sunday night, as the Epstein bill's chances of passage appeared to rise, Trump suddenly reversed course and urged his GOP allies to support the measure.On Monday, Trump said he would sign the bill if Congress passes it.Trump and Epstein had been longtime friends but had a falling out years before Epstein killed himself in jail in August 2019 after being arrested on federal child sex trafficking charges.Last week, the House Oversight Committee released emails showing Epstein discussing Trump.In one email from 2019, Epstein wrote that Trump \"knew about the girls.\"",

    "body": "A Panera Bread sign hangs on the exterior of the restaurant on July 25, 2025 in Miami, Florida. Joe Raedle | Getty ImagesWhen Panera Bread began shrinking its sandwiches and skimping on salads, it started shedding customers.Now, to win them back, the chain plans to reinvest in the business and undo many of those same cost-cutting measures, it said Tuesday.Once the No. 1 fast-casual brand in the U.S., Panera has dipped to No. 3, ceding the top spots to Chipotle Mexican Grill and Panda Express. Last year, its sales fell 5% to $6.1 billion, according to Technomic estimates. For years, the chain's traffic has been shrinking, according to CEO Paul Carbone, who took the reins earlier this year. Controversy after the chain's foray into energy drinks didn't help matters, either.Panera's troubles have coincided with a tough year for fast-casual restaurants. Chipotle, Sweetgreen and Cava have all cut their full-year forecasts as they see younger consumers eating out less frequently.Carbone has a plan to bring back customers. Under the strategy, named \"Panera RISE,\" the company aims to refresh its menu, focus on value, improve its service and build new restaurants. He said the plan has the backing of the franchisees who operate roughly half of its 2,200 U.S. locations, along with the support of JAB Holding, the investment arm of the Reimann family that owns the company.Panera's slide has been poorly timed for JAB. The firm has been plotting an IPO for the chain's parent company, Panera Brands, which also owns Caribou Coffee and Einstein Bros. Bagels.In 2021, four years after taking the chain private, JAB struck a deal with Danny Meyer's special purpose acquisition company for a merger that would take the company public again. But Panera scrapped those plans a year later, citing market conditions. In late 2023, the company confidentially filed for an initial public offering that still hasn't happened.When asked about the status of Panera's IPO plans, Carbone told CNBC that the chain's management team is currently focused on growing traffic and implementing the Panera RISE strategy.Entering the value warsPhase one of Panera's plan is to improve the quality of its food, reversing cost-cutting measures imposed in the face of high inflation, according to Carbone.\"We squeezed food costs. We squeezed labor,\" he said.Some of those changes happened while Carbone was chief financial officer. He now calls himself a \"reformed CFO\" — albeit one who still listens to earnings conference calls.\"It's really about death by a thousand paper cuts, it truly is,\" Carbone said about the chain's downturn.Take Panera's salads, for example. In the summer of 2024, Panera began using a mix of half romaine, half iceberg lettuce to make its salads, saving the chain money compared with when it was using romaine alone. This summer, it reverted back to entirely romaine salads.\"You know what guests told us? No one likes iceberg, and no one gets that and says, 'Oh my God, that white salad, it looks so appetizing,'\" Carbone said.And then there's the cherry tomato. Carbone said Panera is one of the few restaurant chains that doesn't slice the bite-sized tomatoes in half, a decision made to save on labor costs.\"We make the guest chase the cherry tomato around the bowl,\" he said.And when a salad comes with an avocado, customers have to cut the halved fruit themselves, rather than it coming presliced. The chain will start slicing the cherry tomatoes and avocados early next year.Plus, Panera's salads typically have five ingredients, while those of competitors like Sweetgreen feature as many as eight.But it wasn't just salads that were affected by the cost-cutting measures.\"In some instances, we shrunk portions, so guests would walk into our cafe to buy a sandwich that has gone up significantly in price, with lower-quality ingredients, in a smaller size,\" Carbone said.The menu refresh will also include new items. Last month, the chain announced that it is testing new \"fresca\" and \"energy refresher\" drinks.Panera previously offered highly caffeinated energy drinks, but it discontinued the line, which included Charged Lemonade, following two wrongful death lawsuits and related negative publicity. Panera denied wrongdoing and settled the lawsuits earlier this year.When it comes to value, Panera is planning on leaning into a barbell menu strategy, offering customers options on both the low- and high-price end. The approach has worked particularly well for casual-dining chains like Chili's, but Panera doesn't have the same appetizer offerings as a full-service restaurant.\"We haven't cracked the code yet,\" Carbone said. \"We're doing a lot of testing.\"Chains across the restaurant industry have embraced value offerings, from McDonald's Extra Value Meal to Applebee's \"2 for $25\" deal, igniting the so-called value wars. However, restaurants have to balance the desire to attract cash-strapped diners with maintaining their profit margins.To improve the customer experience, Panera is planning to invest more into labor. Like many restaurants, Panera in recent years scheduled fewer workers and relied more on the self-order kiosks it pioneered in the industry. That approach saved money, but customers often walked into a cafe and couldn't find an employee in sight, according to Carbone.Panera will also invest back into its kiosks, which it hasn't significantly upgraded since they first entered its restaurants roughly a decade ago. And its dining rooms will get a facelift, too.If these changes succeed in bringing back lapsed customers, then Panera's restaurants will become more profitable, fueling future restaurant growth. And those new bakery-cafes could look different.\"What does the cafe of the future look like? We're doing a lot of work around that, we're going to test different things,\" Carbone said.",

    "body": "Workers transport soil containing rare earth elements for export at a port in Lianyungang, Jiangsu province, China.China Stringer Network | ReutersLike the U.S., Europe is also feeling the pressure to keep China sweet in order to maintain supplies of rare earth elements, which are vital for its strategic industries in the region such as auto production, green energy and defense.Europe is heavily dependent on China for supplies of the world's 17 rare earth elements and has been looking to calm stormy waters with Beijing over supplies, while looking for alternative sources of critical minerals — including in its own back yard.That's a long process, however, and for now, Europe is as vulnerable as other major consumers of rare earths, and particularly the U.S., when it comes to Beijing's ability to turn the tap off on supplies.Officials from Germany and the Netherlands are in Beijing this week for talks with their Chinese counterparts on China's controls on rare earths exports and semiconductor chips which have made European industries vulnerable to global supply chain disruptions.China dominates the rare earths market from mining to refining, with data from the International Energy Agency showing that, in 2024, China was responsible for 59% of the world's rare earths mining, 91% of its refining and 94% of the manufacuring of permanent magnets which are commonly used in electric vehicles, wind turbines, industrial motors, data centers and defense systems.As the world's single largest supplier of a component that's critical to so much manufacturing, China's dominance has made \"global supply chains in strategic sectors – such as energy, automotive, defense and AI data centres – vulnerable to potential disruptions,\" the IEA noted.That potential for disruption came to the fore this year when, in April and October, Beijing announced licensing requirements, and later export controls, on its rare earth supplies and technologies.Those controls were suspended for a year as a result of a trade truce reached in October between China and the U.S. reached but major rare earth importers such as the U.S. and EU, which imports around 70% of rare earth supplies — and almost all of its rare earth magnets — from China, are all too aware of its vulnerabilities to geopolitical disruptions.Barriers to diversificationLast month, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen announced that the bloc was launching the \"RESourceEU\" plan aimed at reducing reliance on critical raw materials from China \"in the short, medium and long term.\" She said the bloc could do this by recycling existing raw materials, such as those in batteries, and by joint purchasing to stockpiling.Von der Leyen also said the EU would boost investment in strategic projects \"for the production and processing of critical raw materials here in Europe,\" and would speed up work on critical raw materials partnerships with countries like Ukraine, Australia, Canada, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Chile and Greenland.\"The world we face today rewards speed, not hesitation, because today's world is unforgiving. And the global economy is completely different than it was even a few years ago. Europe cannot do things the same way anymore. We learned this lesson painfully with energy; we will not repeat it with critical materials,\" she said, referencing the bloc's reliance, before the Ukraine war, on Russian oil and gas.watch nowValdis Dombrovskis, European Commissioner for Economy and Productivity, told CNBC Monday that the bloc was working to diversify its rare earth supplies but that this would take time.\"I would say there is some positive news, so China has suspended now for 12 months those additional export controls, which were announced in October, which gives us some time. But I also would say it emphasizes the need for the EU to diversify its rare earth and critical minerals supplies, because of many on those rare earths, we are depending more than 90% on China's supplies,\" Dombrovskis said.Necessity the mother of invention?Europe itself has reserves of rare earth materials with deposits found in Turkey, Sweden and Norway but the problem is that it doesn't have the operations to mine those materials, let alone refine and process them — unlike China, which has decades of experience, investment and infrastructure that has fueled its global processing dominance.Europe is also more encumbered with long approval processes and environmental standards when it comes to mining, meaning any regional plans to develop those rare earth deposits could take years. Public opposition is also a factor that has not shackled China.A view of the NEO magnetic plant in Narva, a city in northeastern Estonia. A plant producing rare-earth magnets for Europe's electric vehicle and wind-energy sectors.Xinhua News Agency | Xinhua News Agency | Getty ImagesThe need to diversify from China quickly could cause officials to lower those barriers, however and there are already signs of action, with Europe's first rare earth magnet production plant being opened in Estonia in September. Backed by funding from both Canada and the EU, the plant's raw materials are coming from Australia and Malaysia.\"There's probably a lot more deposits in Europe but ... there are barriers to bringing that online,\" Willis Thomas, principal consultant at CRU Group, told CNBC.\"But if we're getting into a world where risks are being realized on trade tensions, I think that that will continue to push everyone to build out the supply chain and a bit more resilience on it, but it does take some time, and there's limited expertise.\"What's also worrying for Europe is that being unable to control the sources and supply of raw materials could mean that its technological and green ambitions suffer.\"Europe's race towards net zero and digital leadership depend on materials it does not control,\" Hamed Ghiaie, professor of Economics and Public Policy at ESCP Europe, and Filippo Gorelli, an analyst at Nexans, said in analysis for the World Economic Forum.\"For decades, Europe treated raw materials as a commodity issue, rather than a strategic one. That complacency is becoming costly,\" they added.\"What is at stake is climate targets and economic resilience. Shortages of rare earths, gallium or germanium could slow semiconductor fabrication, AI development and even wind-power installation. In short, Europe cannot build a green or digital future on supply chains it doesn't control,\" they concluded.",

    "body": "The Home Depot logo is displayed on a sign outside of a store on Sept. 6, 2025 in San Diego, California.  Kevin Carter | Getty ImagesHome Depot on Tuesday cut its full-year profit forecast and missed Wall Street's earnings expectations for the third straight quarter as it saw weaker home improvement demand, tepid consumer spending and lower-than-usual storm activity.The retailer said it now expects full-year sales will climb about 3% and comparable sales, which take out the impact of one-time factors like store openings and calendar differences, to be slightly positive. That compares with its previous expectations for full-year sales to grow by 2.8% and comparable sales to increase by 1%.The revised outlook includes an estimated $2 billion in incremental revenue from GMS, a building products distributor that Home Depot acquired earlier this year. The company's sales were not part of its previous full-year guidance.Home Depot expects full-year adjusted earnings per share to decline by about 5% from the year-ago period, compared with its prior expectations that they would fall by about 2%In a CNBC interview, Chief Financial Officer Richard McPhail said the retailer previously expected home improvement activity would increase. It also anticipated higher sales of roofing materials, generators and other supplies that typically sell before and after seasonal storms.Neither dynamic materialized, he said, putting pressure on the business. \"When we set guidance, we had anticipated that demand would begin to accelerate gradually in the back half of the year as interest rates and mortgage rates eased,\" he said. \"But what we saw was that ongoing consumer uncertainty and continued pressure in housing are disproportionately impacting home improvement demand.\"Here's what Home Depot reported for the fiscal third quarter compared with Wall Street's estimates, according to a survey of analysts by LSEG:Earnings per share: $3.74 adjusted vs. $3.84 expectedRevenue: $41.35 billion vs. $41.10 billion expectedHome Depot's shares closed at $336.48 on Tuesday, down 6%. As of Tuesday's close, the company's stock is down about 13% so far this year. That trails the S&P 500's nearly 13% gains during the same period.Fewer hurricanes and a 'deferral mindset'For Home Depot, housing turnover typically sparks larger and more lucrative projects as customers fix up their homes before or after moving. Those big projects, however, have dropped in frequency as higher interest rates have led to steeper mortgage rates and borrowing costs for loans, which a homeowner may use to pay for a kitchen remodel or major addition.Since roughly the middle of 2023, McPhail has told CNBC that homeowners have been in a \"deferral mindset.\" That's led to a bit of a waiting game for Home Depot, as it holds out for either lower mortgage rates or a shift by consumers who get used to higher mortgage rates as the new normal.In the most recent three-month period, that waiting game continued. McPhail told CNBC that demand was \"stable\" from the fiscal second quarter to the third quarter when adjusting for the lack of hurricanes. But, he added, \"at this point, it's hard to identify near-term catalysts that would lead to acceleration.\" Home Depot's net income for the three-month period that ended Nov. 2 dropped to $3.60 billion, or $3.62 per share, from $3.65 billion, or $3.67 per share, in the year-ago quarter. Revenue decreased from $40.22 billion in the year-ago quarter.Adjusting for one-time items, including the value of intangible assets, Home Depot reported earnings of $3.74 per share.Comparable sales rose 0.2% in the quarter, falling short of analysts' expectations of 1.4% growth, according to StreetAccount.Sales trends compared to the prior year slowed as the quarter progressed. Comparable sales were up 2% in August, up 0.5% in September and down 1.5% year-over-year in October, Billy Bastek, executive vice president of merchandising said on the company's earnings call.CEO Ted Decker said on an earnings call that the primary driver of that deceleration was the lack of storm activity — particularly when lapping a year-ago period with a lot of hurricanes. He said that pressure will continue into the fourth quarter.Compared with other big-box retailers, Home Depot's customers tend to be more financially stable. About 90% of its do-it-yourself customers own their homes and the home professionals who shop at the retailer tend to get hired by homeowners.Even so, McPhail told CNBC Home Depot gave a weaker outlook in part because shoppers across income groups are reluctant to take on high-dollar projects. He said a slower housing market and the higher cost of borrowing has contributed to the trend.He said other factors may also be having a chilling effect, including the prolonged government shutdown, an uptick in corporate layoff announcements and a decline in home values in some markets.However, Bastek said on the company's earnings call that Home Depot has not seen customers trading down to cheaper products. Instead, he said, they are often opting for more innovative and premium appliances, power tools or other items, which tend to cost more.Big-ticket transactions, which the company defines as costing $1,000 or more, rose 2.3% year over year. Still, Bastek added the company continues to see \"softer engagement in larger discretionary projects where customers typically use financing to fund renovation projects.\"Average ticket, the typical amount spent by customers at the store or on the company's website, rose 1.8% year over year in the quarter. However, customer transactions fell 1.6% year over year.A bright spot in the quarter was online sales, which rose by 11% year over year, McPhail said.Looking to pros for growthAs do-it-yourself customers postpone bigger projects, the company has tried to attract more business from contractors, roofers and other professionals.The company has made two key purchases of pro-related companies. Last year, it bought Texas-based SRS Distribution for $18.25 billion — the largest acquisition in its history. The company sells supplies to professionals in the landscaping, pool and roofing businesses. Home Depot acquired GMS earlier this year.Like other retailers, Home Depot has felt the pinch of higher costs on some imported items because of tariffs. McPhail said in May that the company was diversifying the countries where it sourced its goods and intended to \"generally maintain our current pricing levels across our portfolio.\"However, company leaders warned in August that it may have to hike prices in some categories because of higher tariffs.McPhail told CNBC that Home Depot has increased some items' prices, but said \"where there were price actions, they were modest.\" He said Home Depot has kept prices the same for some key items or even been able to reduce them. For example, he said, its bestselling 7½-foot Grand Duchess Christmas tree and many of its strings of lights for trees have dropped in price. ",

Waymo will first offer fully autonomous trips to its employees in those markets, a spokesperson said.The company has been gearing up to expand its paid robotaxis service in 2026. The company previously announced plans to expand to Detroit, Las Vegas, Nashville, San Diego, Washington, D.C., and London in 2026.Waymo has also begun testing vehicles in New York City and Tokyo.Last week, Waymo began offering freeway routes in the San Francisco, Phoenix and Los Angeles markets. The Google sister company will gradually extend freeway trips to more riders and locations over time.Already, Waymo operates its paid robotaxi service in Austin, San Francisco, Phoenix, Atlanta and Los Angeles. The company has provided more than 10 million paid rides since first launching in 2020, the company said in May.Waymo's Florida and Texas expansion announcement comes the same day that Amazon-owned Zoox began allowing select San Francisco users to hail its driverless vehicles. San Francisco is the second market where Zoox now offers a free service, after its launch in Las Vegas in September. Zoox has deployed a fleet of 50 robotaxis between San Francisco and Las Vegas, the company told CNBC in September.WATCH: Waymo launches paid robotaxi rides on freewayswatch now",

The electric vehicle company applied for a \"transportation network company\" permit on Nov. 13, and was approved on Monday, ADOT said in an emailed statement. Additional permits will be required before Tesla can operate a robotaxi service in Arizona.In July, Tesla applied to conduct autonomous vehicle testing and operations in Phoenix, with and without human safety drivers on board. A month earlier, Tesla started a robotaxi pilot in Austin, Texas, with safety valets and remote operators. Tesla also operates a more traditional car service in the San Francisco Bay Area.Tesla didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.Tesla plans to take human safety drivers out of its cars in Austin before the end of this year. The company is aiming to operate a commercial robotaxi service in Phoenix and several other U.S. cities before the end of 2026.According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's website, Tesla cars equipped with automated driving systems were involved in seven reported collisions following the launch of the company's pilot in Texas. Competitors including Alphabet's Waymo in the U.S. and Baidu's Apollo Go in China are way ahead in the nascent robotaxi ride-hailing market. In the Phoenix area, Waymo operates a sizable commercial business, with at least 400 autonomous vehicles, the company previously told CNBC. In May, Waymo said it had surpassed 10 million driverless trips served to riders across the U.S.Baidu said in an earnings update on Tuesday that its Apollo Go service \"provided 3.1 million fully driverless operational rides in the third quarter of 2025,\" representing year-over-year growth of 212%.Musk has been promising that Tesla will \"solve\" autonomy for years without reaching its goals. The world's richest person has continued with the lofty pronouncements. At the company's 2025 shareholder meeting earlier this month, Musk said the \"killer app\" for self-driving technology is when people can \"text and drive,\" or \"sleep and drive.\" \"Before we allow the car to be driven without paying attention, we need to make sure it's very safe,\" Musk said. \"We're on the cusp of that.

It's been later to another crucial piece of the media playbook — merchandising and live events.The streamer has only recently begun adopting tried-and-true marketing methods that have been in play for the likes of the Walt Disney Co., Universal and Warner Bros. Discovery for decades: namely, consumer product partnerships, special release events and venue destinations that drive fan engagement.In January, the company struck its first master licensing deal with Jazwares, the maker of Squishmallows, to develop a product line for \"Stranger Things,\" including figures, play sets, toy vehicles, costumes and stuffed toys. Jazwares has existing partnerships with brands like Pokemon, Star Wars, Peppa Pig and Hello Kitty.More recently, Netflix signed a landmark licensing deal with toy giants Hasbro and Mattel to develop toys and consumer products based off the smash hit \"KPop Demon Hunters.\"And this month, the company opened Netflix House Philadelphia, a venue in King of Prussia, Pennsylvania, that features immersive experiences, interactive games, live performances and themed dining.

Only in the last decade has it been building out its library of original and proprietary content.The streamer's first original series release was 2012's \"Lilyhammer,\" a Norwegian crime show about the misadventures of a mafia underboss living in the witness protection program. Its original programming really took off with 2013's \"House of Cards,\" a political thriller about a ruthless congressman bent on revenge after being passed over for secretary of State — the first series produced exclusively for the streaming service.\"They're still a young company in the grand scheme of things,\" said Alicia Reese, an analyst at Wedbush. \"They had to build out their content first and fandom had to occur organically.\"That's one of the reasons why the company didn't launch a consumer products division until 2019 or an officially licensed online shop until 2021.Before that, the streaming giant had been working with consumer brands to create T-shirts, mugs, plush toys and the like. It was predominantly working with licensees, collecting fees for other companies to design and make the products, or participating in brand partnerships where no fees were exchanged.At the time, those strategies helped Netflix reap the benefit of more exposure. Now, Netflix is taking the reins.\"This is a great turning point for [Netflix] ... the pivot into merchandising efforts,\" Reese said. \"But, also, I wouldn't limit it to merchandising efforts. There is also games and gaming.\"In addition to deals with Epic Games' Fortnite, in which players can purchase cosmetic items from \"Stranger Things,\" \"Squid Game,\" \"Wednesday\" and \"KPop Demon Hunters,\" Netflix also has a collection of mobile games based on its original content.There's also Netflix's growing live entertainment business.Since 2020, the company has launched more than 40 experiences in 300 cities. This includes \"Bridgerton\" events like The Queen's Ball, which took place in nearly a dozen cities globally in 2022 and 2023 and invited guests to dress in their Regency-era finest for a themed party, as well as a concert series through Candlelight featuring music from the show.Shonda Rhimes, Golda Rosheuvel and cast members visit The Queen’s Ball: A Bridgerton Experience in New York on April 30, 2023.Ilya S. Savenok | Getty Images Entertainment | Getty ImagesThere was also an immersive experience centered on \"Stranger Things\" that allowed fans to explore Hawkins Lab and other iconic locations from the series in more than a dozen cities. It's currently running in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, and will open in Mexico City next month. And, a play called \"Stranger Things: The First Shadow\" has been running in the West End in London since 2023.Netflix's merchandise and live events strategy is not just a way for the company to generate additional revenue outside of its streaming subscriptions. It helps keep fans engaged with its content during show hiatuses and in between movie sequels.\"KPop Demon Hunters,\" for example, isn't expected to have a follow-up film until 2029.\"You know, 2029 that's a long wait,\" Reese said. \"But, having the merchandise, having pop-up shops or live events or some sort of fan engagement in the interim will definitely help to keep that engagement alive until they have the next content release.\"The strategy has been part of Disney's playbook for decades. The company has used its IP as an anchor in its theme parks, cruise lines and resort locations as well as in the retail space to give fans more points of connection for the stories they love and keep them engaged with the brand in between film and television releases.Netflix is now adopting this method and has been deliberate in what kinds of products and experiences it delivers to fans as it dives further into the segment.\"Bridgerton\" merchandise includes tea sets, elegant pajamas, candles, beauty supplies and even curated dog accessories, all with a delicate, pastel color palate. The \"Stranger Things\" product line includes items like specialty Eggo waffles, Dungeons & Dragons sets, '80s-themed fashion items and a bolder, darker color scheme.\"We think about it both as an extension of the fandom, but also as an extension of the storytelling,\" Netflix's Lee said of the company's merchandising strategy. \"A sticker book for 'KPop Demon Hunters' is not going to be a revenue driver for us, but if you're a kid that loves that ... a sticker book might be the perfect thing you pick up, that sort of low-dollar commitment. So, for us, across every IP and across every category, we are balancing a commercial opportunity that we think will drive revenue and also things that bring fans joy.\"Disclosure: Comcast is the parent company of NBCUniversal, which owns CNBC. Versant would become the new parent company of CNBC upon Comcast's planned spinoff of Versant.Correction: Netflix House Philadelphia is in King of Prussia, Pennsylvania.

    "body": "Dua Lipa performs during a concert as part of the \"Radical Optimism Tour\" at Estadio Mas Monumental Antonio Vespucio Liberti on Nov. 8, 2025 in Buenos Aires, Argentina.Tomas Cuesta | Getty ImagesThe U.K. government is set to ban the resale of live-event tickets for above face value on Wednesday. The move covers concerts, major sports, and theater, according to multiple British press reports.The move was not a surprise, as the country's Labor Party under Prime Minister Keir Starmer had signaled earlier support for a crackdown on ticket practices, citing the issue of inflated resale prices as a significant consumer protection issue.Dozens of artists including Sam Fender, Dua Lipa and Coldplay signed a recent open letter urging Starmer to move ahead with promises and implement a cap on resale price tickets.Housing Secretary Steve Reed told BBC Breakfast that the government, \"was committed to outlawing it.\"New legislation is expected to include caps on platform fees and price limits to avoid any workarounds that artificially inflate prices using new methods. A U.K. government inquiry begun early in 2025 had been considering a cap on the price of ticket resales in a range from the original price up to as much as a 30% markup, but is now expected to pursue the stricter course of action.The U.K. government's Department for Culture, Media and Sport estimates the move could reduce the average resale ticket price by as much as $48, according to the reports.Ticket reseller StubHub shares closed down near 6% on Tuesday after reports of the impending ban. Its shares have fallen 37% over the past week after it failed to provide guidance when it reported earnings last week.Shares of Live Nation Entertainment, which owns Ticketmaster, were lower on Tuesday but closed in line with the broader market decline. Live Nation released a statement ahead of the expected U.K. ban saying it \"fully supports the UK government's plan\" and noted it already limits all resale in the U.K. to face value prices. \"This is another major step forward for fans – cracking down on exploitative touting to help keep live events accessible. We encourage others around the world to adopt similar fan-first policies.\"The move comes as U.S. regulators have scrutinized bot-based ticket harvesting, and several investigations have focused on deceptive fee structures and inflated resale pricing. For Taylor Swift's \"Eras Tour,\" the average resale ticket was over $1,000.Swift producer and fellow musician Jack Antonoff recently slammed Live Nation CEO Michael Rapino for saying at a CNBC event that concert tickets were underpriced.\"Answer is simple: Selling a ticket for more than its face value should be illegal,\" he wrote.The Federal Trade Commission sued Live Nation and Ticketmaster in September, alleging illegal ticket resale practices. Last year, the Justice Department sued to break up Live Nation and Ticketmaster over alleged antitrust violations, claiming the company had too large a monopoly in the ticketing industry, a move that came after widespread fan complaints after a botched rollout for tickets to Swift's Eras Tour. Pressure has increased for more transparent ticket markets across live music, sports, and large-scale touring.watch now",

    "body": "watch nowMeta won its high-profile antitrust case against the Federal Trade Commission, which had accused the company of holding a monopoly in social networking. In a memorandum opinion released Tuesday, Judge James Boasberg of the U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C., said the FTC failed to prove its argument. The case, initially filed by the FTC five years ago, centered on Meta's acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp.\"Whether or not Meta enjoyed monopoly power in the past, though, the agency must show that it continues to hold such power now,\" Boasberg said in the filing. \"The Court's verdict today determines that the FTC has not done so. A judgment so stating shall issue this day.\"Boasberg dismissed the case in 2021, saying the agency didn't have enough evidence to prove \"Facebook holds market power.\" In August of that year, the FTC filed an amended complaint with more details about the company's user numbers and metrics relative to competitors like Snapchat, the now-defunct Google+ social network and Myspace.After reviewing the amendments, Boasberg in 2022 ruled that the case could proceed, saying the FTC had presented more details than before.\"We are deeply disappointed in this decision,\" said Joe Simonson, the FTC's director of public affairs. \"The deck was always stacked against us with Judge Boasberg, who is currently facing articles of impeachment. We are reviewing all our options.\" Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, former operating chief Sheryl Sandberg, Instagram co-founder Kevin Systrom, and other current and former Meta executives all testified in the trial, which began in April.The social media company's shares fell less than 1% on Tuesday. The stock is up about 2% for the year, badly underperforming broader indexes and most of its megacap tech peers.\"The Court's decision today recognizes that Meta faces fierce competition,\" the company's chief legal officer Jennifer Newstead said in a statement. \"Our products are beneficial for people and businesses and exemplify American innovation and economic growth. We look forward to continuing to partner with the Administration and to invest in America.\" The ruling comes a little over two months after Google avoided the harshest possible penalty from an antitrust case it lost last year. While Google was found to hold an illegal monopoly in its core market of internet search, U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta decided the company would not be forced to sell its Chrome browser, bucking the Department of Justice's request. Google was, however, ordered to loosen its hold on search data.watch nowIn the Meta case, the FTC claimed the company shouldn't have been allowed to buy Instagram for $1 billion in 2012 and WhatsApp for $19 billion in 2014, and the agency called for those units to be divested. The commission also alleged that there were no major alternatives for apps like Facebook and Instagram that people use to communicate with friends and family in a online, social space.However, a major challenge for the FTC, according to the judge, was in proving that Meta is breaking antitrust law today, not years ago when the primary use of social networks was very different and based on sharing other kinds of content.\"To win the permanent injunction that it seeks here, the FTC must prove a current or imminent legal violation,\" he wrote.Boasberg ultimately sided with Meta's argument that the technology industry has evolved since the early days of Facebook, and the company now faces a wide variety of competitors like TikTok.\"While each of Meta's empirical showings can be quibbled with, they all tell a consistent story: people treat TikTok and YouTube as substitutes for Facebook and Instagram, and the amount of competitive overlap is economically important,\" Boasberg wrote. \"Against that unmistakable pattern, the FTC offers no empirical evidence of substitution whatsoever.\"Big changes in socialMuch of Boasberg's conclusion was built on the transformation that's taken place in the social media market in recent years and Meta's changing position within it. User trends have moved heavily in the direction of video, where TikTok and YouTube have massive user bases and huge network effects.\"The most-used part of Meta's apps is thus indistinguishable from the offerings on TikTok and YouTube,\" Boasberg wrote.watch nowBoasberg explained that there was enough evidence to show \"that consumers are reallocating massive amounts of time from Meta's apps\" to those services and others, which has \"forced Meta to invest gobs of cash to keep up.\"\"Meta is not a monopolist insulated from competition,\" he wrote. \"The Court finds the evidence favoring Meta on this issue both credible and convincing.\"Boasberg also cited various documents and testimony from \"industry insiders\" that show how other tech companies like TikTok and YouTube viewed Meta as serious competition. \"TikTok and YouTube tracked Meta's products as competitive threats,\" Boasberg wrote.WATCH: FTC chair on independencewatch now",

    "body": "People walk in a shopping mall in the Sanlitun area in Beijing, China, on April 4, 2025.Kevin Frayer | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesEQT, one of the largest private market investors in the world, is doubling down on Asia, calling the region a big growth engine and home to some of the most compelling opportunities across private equity and infrastructure. \"Asia is a big growth opportunity for us… we see some of the most attractive opportunities in our pipeline in Asia,\" EQT CEO Per Franzén said in an interview with CNBC. The Swedish private equity giant said more private market investors worldwide are seeking to diversify their portfolios and channel more money toward the region.Earlier in April, EQT raised over $10 billion for its ninth Asia private equity fund, the BPEA Private Equity Fund IX, which launched in August 2024 with a $12.5 billion target. The firm also plans to invest around $930 million in South Korea's enterprise software provider Douzone Bizon.EQT's emphasis on the region also mirrors that of other private equity players.watch nowRival KKR recently said that half of the 2025 private‐equity capital that it will return to investors this year will be from Asia. The American firm even held its first board meeting in Tokyo, despite being headquartered in New York.Jean-Eric Salata, EQT's long-time Asia chair and nominee for global chairman next year, said the firm's Asia strategy hinges on a strong local presence to exploit what he called \"structural alpha opportunities\" in the region, or inefficiencies, especially when compared to the U.S. and Europe.\"The markets here are quite inefficient, in many ways more inefficient… so in order to capture that alpha, you really need to be on the ground and have a local presence,\" Salata said, adding that EQT has 350 staff across Asia.He noted, however, that Asia's complexity and relatively high entry barriers make operating locally essential for sourcing deals, recruiting talent, and driving exits.China: a bright spot for early-stage deals?While many global private equity investors remain cautious on China, EQT sees a different opportunity set emerging.\"The buyout strategy, we believe, is still a little early… the maturity of the market is not quite there yet in China.\" said Salata.\"Where we see a lot more interesting opportunities in China is in the early stage strategies where there's a tremendous amount of innovation… a tremendous amount of growth.\"He added that EQT's strategy in Asia centers on companies tied to domestic demand rather than cross-border flows, allowing its assets in industries such as services, software, education and financial services to be more insulated from geopolitics such as U.S.-China tensions.\"We own one of the largest hospital groups in India, doing gastrointestinal procedures. That business is booming, and it's really completely uncorrelated to what's going on with trade or with trade tariffs and all of that complexity,\" Salata said.In 2020, China accounted for more than half of all Asia-Pacific private equity deal value, but that share plunged to 27% in 2024, according to a Bain & Company report this year.Additionally, while some private-equity managers have attributed weak exits to high interest rates, EQT said its decisions and outcomes have been largely independent of monetary cycles.Franzén said the firm isn't counting on rates falling: \"We certainly don't count on interest rates coming down… It will be important that you continue to invest into your value creation capabilities.\"Salata cited examples such as Nord Anglia Education, which EQT acquired with a consortium in March, valuing the international schools operator at $14.5 billion.\"People want to invest more in their children's education, particularly in this part of the world and that business, we delivered $10 billion of distributions back to our investors, again, through a very challenging environment, in terms of where interest rates were,\" Salata said.\"If you have the right assets in the right sectors, and you're adding value to the businesses, we try to create an all-weather strategy that's not necessarily correlated to what's going on with interest rates.\"",

Papa John's is expected release quarterly earnings results after the close of U.S. financial markets on May 5.Luke Sharrett | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesShares of Papa John's sank 10% on Tuesday following a report that Apollo Global has withdrawn its offer to take the pizza chain private.Reuters reported that the private equity firm backtracked on its bid, valued at $64 a share, about a week ago. The firm previously submitted an offer for Papa John's alongside Irth Capital Management, according to Reuters.Apollo and Papa John's did not immediately respond to requests for comment.Papa John's is preparing to release its third-quarter earnings report on Thursday. The company's stock is down nearly 30% in the last year.The report comes as restaurants and other consumer-focused companies have been reporting sluggish sales amid rising inflation and costs.Last week, Chipotle executives said the fast food chain saw a 0.8% traffic decline, marking the third straight quarter of declines and a pullback in consumers across all income cohorts. Procter & Gamble reported in October that its lower-income customers are significantly paring back their spending.The report follows another significant deal development in the restaurant space. Earlier on Tuesday, Yum Brands said it plans to review strategic options for Pizza Hut, following years of struggles for the pizza chain.",

Stephen Cohen | Getty ImagesA UPS plane crashed shortly after taking off from Louisville Muhammad Ali International Airport in Kentucky at around 5:15 p.m. local time Tuesday, the Federal Aviation Administration said.Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear said in a press conference that there were at least three fatalities from the crash and at least 11 injuries, some of them significant.UPS said in a statement that there were three crewmembers on the plane. It was unclear if the fatalities were from the plane or on the ground, and Beshear said the status of the crew was unknown. He added that there was an emergency response area set up for families.The reason for the crash was not immediately known. The plane was a MD-11F, a type of freight transport aircraft made by aircraft manufacturer McDonnell Douglas, which merged with Boeing in 1997. The plane had hundreds of thousands of fuel on board to travel all the way to Honolulu, Louisville Fire Chief Brian O'Neill said in the press conference.The Louisville Metro Police Department said on X that it was implementing a shelter-in-place order near the crash site.  Several businesses near the area were affected, officials said.There was no hazardous material on the plane that would create an environmental issue, but the place where it crashed \"could create those types of situations,\" Beshear said. He called it an \"all-hands on deck response.\"A plume of smoke wafts over airport property after reports of a plane crash at Louisville International Airport, Tuesday, Nov. 4, 2025, in Louisville, Ky.Jon Cherry | APA large plume of black smoke was visible near the airport, and footage from local TV showed fire and debris in a large radius around the crash site.The FAA said the plane was en route to Honolulu and that it and the National Transportation Safety Board would investigate the incident. The NTSB will be the lead investigator.The airport was closed following the incident, and \"all arriving and departing flights at SDF are temporarily suspended,\" the airport said in a statement on X Tuesday evening.The airport is home to the UPS Worldport, which the company says is its largest package handling facility in the world. Hundreds of UPS flights take off daily from Louisville, according to the company.— CNBC's Dennis Green contributed to this report.",

    "body": "A jobseeker holds a brochure during a NYS Department Of Labor job fair at the Downtown Central Library in Buffalo, New York, US, on Wednesday, Aug. 27, 2025. Lauren Petracca | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesEmployment opportunities hit their lowest level in more than 4½ years as October came to a close and the government shutdown dragged on, according to data from jobs site Indeed.The firm's Job Postings Index fell to 101.9 as of Oct. 24, the most recent point for which data is available. That's the lowest since early February 2021 for a measure that uses February 2020 as a baseline value of 100.The level represents a 0.5% decline from the beginning of the month and a roughly 3.5% tumble from mid-August, the latest point from which Bureau of Labor Statistics data is available.Under normal conditions, the BLS on Tuesday would have reported its monthly Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, a measure that Federal Reserve officials watch closely for indications of slack in the jobs market. With the shutdown on the precipice of being the longest in history, economists and policymakers are left to look at alternative data for big-picture indicators.The most recent JOLTS report, for August, also indicated an ongoing decline in openings. The BLS reported that job openings totaled 7.23 million, about level with July but down 7% from January.Indeed's dashboard of indicators also has shown a pullback in salary offerings as job advertisements have declined. Year-over-year wages as judged by salary offerings in Indeed postings rose 2.5% in August, down from 3.4% in January.A softening labor market has generated concern from Fed officials. The central bank's Federal Open Market Committee last week voted 10-2 to lower its benchmark interest rate by a quarter percentage point to a target range of 3.75%-4%.Officials have cited rising risks to the labor market taking precedence over ongoing concerns about inflation holding nearly a full percentage point above the Fed's 2% target.\"Hiring is slowing. We see this from Indeed, from job postings,\" Fed Governor Lisa Cook said Monday. \"We're looking at a panoply of data, and those are real time. We're not waiting on the unemployment report. There's reason to be concerned, because there's a slight uptick in the unemployment rate over the summer.\"The nonfarm payrolls report normally would be released Friday, but that also is not happening. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones expect the BLS count would have shown a decline of 60,000 jobs in October and an increase in the unemployment rate to 4.5%.",

Jonathan Ernst | ReutersThe ongoing U.S. government shutdown is about to become the nation's longest federal funding lapse ever.The shutdown is poised to hit that milestone on Wednesday, marking its 36th day and surpassing the previous record, which was set in early 2019.The latest attempt to break the logjam, by getting a Republican-backed stopgap measure passed by Congress, failed in the Senate for the 14th time on Tuesday.There are no further votes scheduled Tuesday on the GOP's short-term continuing resolution, or on an alternative proposal put forward by Democrats, which includes additional spending on health care and other priorities.Both of the longest government shutdowns in U.S. history occurred while President Donald Trump was in office.The funding dispute centers on enhanced tax credits for insurance premiums under the Affordable Care Act, which are set to expire by year's end, threatening to significantly hike health care costs for millions of Americans. Democrats have refused to vote for any \"clean\" stopgap resolution that does not address those subsidies. Republicans have rejected the prospect of negotiating while the government remains shut down. While Republicans hold a narrow majority in the Senate, they need Democratic votes to overcome the chamber's 60-vote threshold.Some Republicans on Tuesday said they have grown \"optimistic\" that the shutdown could end this week.Sen. Mike Rounds, R-S.D., told reporters that he believes Democrats will be more open to cutting a deal after breaking the shutdown length record and after Tuesday's elections are complete.They will be able to tell their constituents \"we're fighting the President, and I think that's a major part of what this is about,\" Rounds said. Sen. Markwayne Mullin, R-Okla., said he was \"pretty confident\" the shutdown would end in the coming days.But some Democrats have poured cold water on the prospect of a coming compromise.\"There seems to be some indication of a thaw, but I see no immediate solution on the horizon,\" Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., said.\"Talks are a good thing, but so far, I sense no willingness on the part of Republicans to really assure the American people that health care insurance will be guaranteed,\" he said.Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., asked about Republicans' optimism, said, \"That would be nice. I hope that means Republicans are coming to the table to negotiate with Democrats, because so far, they have come to the table to negotiate exactly zero times.\" This is developing news.

But Jones' campaign came under intense fire early last month, when his 2022 texts envisioning violence against a GOP political opponent were published by National Review.Jones repeatedly apologized for sending the texts, including during his Oct. 16 debate with Miyares.The scandal shook up elections statewide, with Republican groups spending millions on a flurry of ads attacking Jones, NBC News reported. The texts emerged as Republicans have sought to link Democrats' rhetoric to acts of political violence, including the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk.Some Virginia Democrats disavowed the texts, but few if any called on Jones to drop out of the race. Jones joined Spanberger and former President Barack Obama at a get-out-the-vote rally in Norfolk on Saturday.Earle-Sears saw a fundraising boost as the controversy unfolded, and she sought to capitalize on the scandal in her mid-October debate versus Spanberger.

Andrew Cuomo, a longtime Democrat running as an independent, and Republican Curtis Sliwa, founder of Guardian Angels.The winner will replace New York's scandal-plagued mayor, Eric Adams, who dropped out of the contest in late September.Mamdani, a state Assemblyman now in his third term, defeated the 67-year-old Cuomo in a stunning upset in June's Democratic ranked-choice primary.Polls for the general election have consistently shown Mamdani leading the race.Mamdani, a native of Uganda who became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 2018, has called for a freeze in the rent of rent-stabilized apartments in the city, free public buses and the creation of city-owned grocery stores.His platform and political worldview have sparked a backlash from city billionaires and other business interests, with anti-Mamdani political action committees raising more than $40 million to oppose his candidacy and back Cuomo.Cuomo, who previously was U.S. Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, as well as New York state attorney general, resigned as governor in August 2021 after being accused by multiple women of sexual harassment.Cuomo, whose father, Mario Cuomo, served three terms as the state's governor, has denied wrongdoing.His campaign platform calls for increasing the size of the city's police department, deploying more officers in the city's subways, building more affordable housing and reducing school class size.The former radio host Sliwa, 71, in his second campaign for mayor, has leaned heavily on issues surrounding public safety, and called for hiring 7,000 additional police officers.Read more CNBC politics coverageNYC mayoral election: Mamdani, Cuomo, Sliwa fight to replace Adams as Trump weighs inNJ governor election: Sherrill and Ciattarelli face off in close race as Trump, Obama weigh inVirginia governor election: Spanberger and Earle-Sears vie to succeed YoungkinSNAP update: Trump admin will pay 50% of food stamp benefits in November amid shutdownTrump says he has 'no idea who' Binance's CZ is after pardoning himTrump backtracks on attending Supreme Court tariffs case argumentsAdams also had been running as an independent after skipping his Democratic Party's primary.Adams' public approval ratings had plummeted after his indictment in 2024 on federal corruption charges, which were later dismissed by a judge at the behest of the Department of Justice following the return of President Donald Trump to the White House.Adams last month endorsed Cuomo, whom he had recently called a \"snake and a liar.\"Since Adams' withdrawal, Sliwa has faced intensifying pressure to quit the race to boost Cuomo's chances against Mamdani.Among those calling for Sliwa to drop out has been his fellow Republican, Trump, who has repeatedly and inaccurately claimed that Mamdani is a \"communist.\"This is developing news.

    "body": "watch nowPalantir CEO Alex Karp ranted against short sellers, calling out specifically Michael Burry after a filing revealed the investor of \"The Big Short\" fame had bets against the artificial intelligence software company, as well as Nvidia, at the end of the last quarter.\"The two companies he's shorting are the ones making all the money, which is super weird,\" Karp told CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" on Tuesday. \"The idea that chips and ontology is what you want to short is bats--- crazy.\"\"He's actually putting a short on AI. ... It was us and Nvidia,\" Karp added.When reached via email by CNBC seeking comment on Karp's remarks, Burry declined to comment.Palantir shares slid 8% on Tuesday even after the software company beat Wall Street estimates for the third quarter and offered upbeat guidance. Investors have grown increasingly wary of lofty valuations in AI-linked names. Palantir's stock, which was up 173% for the year heading into Tuesday's trading, has a forward price-earnings ratio of 228. Nvidia fell 4% after gaining over 50% this year.\"I do think this behavior is egregious and I'm going to be dancing around when it's proven wrong,\" said Karp of short sellers.Burry's hedge fund, Scion Asset Management, disclosed put options with a notional value of about $187 million against Nvidia and $912 million against Palantir as of Sept. 30. in a filing. The filing didn't specify the strike prices or expiration dates of the contracts.It's unclear whether Burry is profiting from Tuesday's declines. The filing reflects his positions at the end of September, and he may have since adjusted his portfolio by now. Burry declined to comment on his positions.\"It's not even clear he's shorting us. It's probably just, 'How do I get my position out and not look like a fool?'\" Karp said.The disclosure comes after Burry hinted at renewed caution in markets in a cryptic post on X last week.\"Sometimes, we see bubbles. Sometimes, there is something to do about it. Sometimes, the only winning move is not to play,\" he wrote to his 1.3 million followers on the platform.Burry gained fame for his prescient bet against mortgage-backed securities before the 2008 financial crisis, a trade chronicled in Michael Lewis' book \"The Big Short\" and the Oscar-winning film of the same name.\"With the shorts it's very complex ... honestly I think what's going on here is market manipulation,\" Karp said. \"We delivered the best results anyone's ever seen. It's not even clear he's not doing this to get out of his position. I mean these people, they claim to be ethical, but they are actually shorting one of the great businesses of the world.\"",

Ken Cedeno | ReutersPresident Donald Trump has renominated Jared Isaacman to run NASA after pulling his prior nomination months ago due to what the president called a \"thorough review of prior associations.\"\"Jared's passion for Space, astronaut experience, and dedication to pushing the boundaries of exploration, unlocking the mysteries of the universe, and advancing the new Space economy, make him ideally suited to lead NASA into a bold new Era,\" Trump wrote in a post on Truth Social on Tuesday. Isaacman, who is friends with Tesla CEO Elon Musk, was originally picked to lead NASA in December, before Trump had even taken office. Isaacman is a billionaire who founded payments company Shift4 and has led two private spaceflights.But Trump pulled the nomination in late May after a spat between the president and Musk, who had been leading a White House effort to slash the size of the federal government. Trump said at the time that he was withdrawing the pick because of Isaacman's past associations, though he didn't specify what those were. Some reports have suggested that it was a reference to Isaacman's prior donations to Democrats.Days after the withdrawal, Isaacman told Shift4 investors in a letter that his \"brief stint in politics was a thrilling experience.\" He also said that he was resigning as CEO of Shift4, which he founded in 1999 at age 16, and would assume the role of executive chairman. He had been planning to leave the company if his nomination was confirmed by the Senate. But it never got that far.Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy has been running NASA as interim head since July. Isaacman still must go through the Senate confirmation process. The federal government has been shut down since the beginning of October, but the Senate is still able to confirm presidential nominees. WATCH: Trump renominates Jared Isaacman to run NASAwatch now",

    "body": "A volunteer displays information on the Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program (SNAP) at a grocery store in Dorchester, Massachusetts, US, on Monday, Nov. 3, 2025. Mel Musto | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesPresident Donald Trump on Tuesday suggested that the United States would not pay any SNAP benefits during the government shutdown, contradicting a court filing a day earlier by his administration.Trump said that the benefits, which help feed 42 million Americans, will resume only after Democrats in Congress agree to pass a stopgap funding bill that would reopen the government.The administration on Monday told a federal judge in Rhode Island that it would pay half of the costs of the SNAP benefits for November.Trump on Tuesday said in a Truth Social post, \"SNAP BENEFITS, which increased by Billions and Billions of Dollars (MANY FOLD!) during Crooked Joe Biden's disastrous term in office (Due to the fact that they were haphazardly 'handed' to anyone for the asking, as opposed to just those in need, which is the purpose of SNAP!), will be given only when the Radical Left Democrats open up government, which they can easily do, and not before!\"The White House, when asked by CNBC for clarification on Trump's statement given the court filing Monday, said, \"Refer you to the President's truth.\"White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt, at a briefing later, told reporters that \"the administration is fully complying with the court order.\"Leavitt said she had spoken to Trump about his post, and added, \"The recipients of these SNAP benefits need to understand it's going to take some time to receive this money, because the Democrats have forced the administration into a very untenable position.\"\"We are digging into a contingency fund that is supposed to be for emergencies, catastrophes, for war, and the president does not want to have to tap into this fund in the future, and that's what he was referring to in his Truth Social post,\" Leavitt said.She also said that the U.S. Department of Agriculture had issued guidance on Tuesday to individual states about the amount of money being disbursed to SNAP recipients.The social media post came shortly after lawyers for plaintiffs in a court case challenging the administration's cessation of SNAP benefits told a federal judge in Rhode Island that the decision to pay partial benefits out of a contingency fund did not meet his prior order that any decision to make partial payments \"cannot be arbitrary and capricious.\"The judge, Jack McConnell, had told the administration on Friday that it needed to pay SNAP benefits as soon as possible out of a contingency fund, and that is also needed to investigate whether other federal funds could be used to keep the program fully funded in the absence of a new appropriation by Congress.Read more CNBC government shutdown coverage Government shutdown could cost U.S. economy up to $14 billion, CBO saysJudge extends ban on Trump firing federal workers during government shutdownStates sue Trump admin to keep SNAP benefits during government shutdownLargest federal worker union urges end to government shutdownTrump's $130 million mystery military donor is Timothy Mellon: NYTGovernment shutdown becomes second-longest in U.S. historyStates sue Trump administration to keep SNAP benefits Government shutdown becomes 2nd longest in U.S. historyHow to get student loan help during the government shutdownWhite House economic advisor Hassett says shutdown could end this weekArmy Corps of Engineers pausing $11 billion in projects over shutdown: VoughtGovernment shutdown: Trump distrust keeps Democrats from forming 'gang'Bill to fund military during government shutdown fails in Senate procedural voteThe Trump administration on Monday told McConnell that it would use all of the $4.65 billion remaining in the contingency fund, but said it had declined to use at least $4 billion from the Child Nutrition Program to keep SNAP fully funded for November, at least.Lawyers for plaintiffs in the case told McConnell on Tuesday, \"The Court should grant a temporary restraining order and preliminary stay on the ground that Defendants' decision not to provide full SNAP benefits — even though they have funds available to do so and even though switching to partial payments at this late date will cause devastating delay — is arbitrary and capricious.\"McConnell later told the Trump administration to respond to the request by Wednesday.The dispute over the continuation of the SNAP benefits in the past week has become a major issue in the ongoing U.S. government shutdown, which began Oct. 1.Past presidential administrations have continued disbursing funds for SNAP during prior government shutdowns.But the Trump administration recently said SNAP benefits would end this week because Congress had not approved funding needed to continue the program during the shutdown. The administration, in what is seen as an effort to pressure Democrats in Congress to vote to end the shutdown, also refused to use more than $4 billion in contingency funds that Congress had set aside explicitly for SNAP.Separate groups of plaintiffs then sued the Department of Agriculture in different federal courts to compel the department to continue paying the benefits.",

    "body": "Nikolas Kokovlis | Nurphoto | Getty ImagesPinterest shares tanked nearly 20% on Tuesday after the company reported third-quarter financial results that missed on earnings per share and provided weak guidance.Here's how the company did, compared to analysts' consensus estimates from LSEG:Earnings per share: 38 cents adjusted vs. 42 cents expectedRevenue: $1.05 billion vs. $1.05 billion expectedPinterest's third-quarter sales grew 17% year over year while net income was $92.11 million, up 201% from $30.56 million a year ago during the same period.The company said fourth-quarter revenue will come in between $1.31 billion and $1.34 billion. The midpoint of the revenue outlook, $1.325 billion, trailed Wall Street's projections of $1.34 billion.After the stock move in extended-trading on Tuesday, Pinterest erased its gains for the year.Pinterest said it recorded 600 million global monthly active users in the third quarter, ahead of the 590 million that StreetAccount was projecting. In August, Pinterest reported 578 million monthly active users for the second quarter.The company logged $306 million in third-quarter adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or EBIDTA. That was higher than StreetAccount's estimates of $295 million.Third-quarter sales in the U.S. and Canada came in at $786 million, lower than StreetAccount's estimates of $799 million.Pinterest's third-quarter global average revenue per user was $1.78 and less than the $1.79 that StreetAccount was projecting.\"Our investments in AI and product innovation are paying off,\" Pinterest CEO Bill Ready said in a statement. \"We've become a leader in visual search and have effectively turned our platform into an AI-powered shopping assistant for 600 million consumers.\"Pinterest finance chief Julia Donnelly said during an earnings call that the company experienced some \"pockets of moderating ad spend\" in the U.S. and Canada regions during the third quarter. Donnelly attributed the sales moderation to unspecified \"larger U.S. retailers\" that are dealing with tariff-related issues putting pressure on their margins.Regarding the company's fourth-quarter guidance, Donnelly said that \"we see these broader trends and market uncertainty continuing with the addition of a new tariff in Q4 impacting the home furnishing category.\" President Donald Trump said in September that the White House would impose 10% tariffs on imported timber and lumber and 25% duties on kitchen cabinets, bathroom vanities and related furniture.Tech giants Meta, Alphabet and Amazon reported their most recent quarterly earnings last week. Those reports showed strong digital advertising sales amid their big spending for artificial intelligence infrastructure.Meta said that its third-quarter revenue, of which 98% is derived from online ads, soared 26% year-over-year to $51.24 billion, representing the company's strongest year-over-year sales growth since the first quarter of 2024.Sales in Amazon's online ad unit rose 24% year-over-year to $17.7 billion, which was a faster growth rate than the tech giant's AWS cloud computing unit.Alphabet reported $74.18 billion in total advertising sales for the third quarter, which was a nearly 13% increase from $65.85 billion a year ago. The company's YouTube unit saw third-quarter online revenue jump 15% increase to $10.26 billion.Reddit reported third-quarter earnings last Thursday and said sales ballooned 68% year-over-year to $585 million while global daily active uniques were up 19% year-over-year to 116 million, topping estimates of 114 million. Snap reports its quarterly results on Wednesday.WATCH: Final Trades: Meta, S&P Global and Idexx Lab.watch now",

She added that there is another $8 billion left to cover $2 billion in remaining claims.Assistant U.S. Attorney Thane Rehn spent the bulk of his time during the hearing answering questions by the judge over how an $11 billion forfeiture against SBF is structured, and what will happen to that forfeiture order if all victims are made whole before the entire amount is spent.",

    "body": "New Jersey Republican gubernatorial candidate, Jack Ciattarelli (L), and New Jersey Democratic gubernatorial candidate Mikie SherrillGetty ImagesThe results of New Jersey's gubernatorial election were too early to call as polls closed at 8 p.m. ET on Tuesday, NBC News projected.Democratic candidate Mikie Sherrill is squaring off against Republican nominee Jack Ciattarelli to succeed Gov. Phil Murphy, a Democrat finishing his second and final term.The race — one of just two U.S. gubernatorial elections this year — is seen as a bellwether for how President Donald Trump's policies are affecting support for Republicans nationally.The result also could help shape the electoral landscape for the 2026 midterms, when Democrats hope to retake control of at least one chamber of Congress.The former U.S. Navy helicopter pilot Sherrill has represented New Jersey's 11th congressional district in the House of Representatives since 2019.Ciattarelli is a businessman who has run for governor twice before.While Democrats far outnumber Republicans in New Jersey, some polls leading up to Tuesday's election showed a neck-and-neck race between the candidates.But early voting totals before Election Day showed Democrats building a solid turnout firewall, according to DecisionDeskHQ Data Science Director Michael Pruser.State officials said Tuesday morning that multiple polling places received non-credible bomb threats, causing some voters to be redirected to other sites to cast their ballots.Sherrill called the threats \"a clear attempt to undermine our democratic system and intimidate New Jerseyans from going to the polls to exercise their right to vote.\"Trump lost New Jersey to Democratic nominee Kamala Harris in the 2024 election. But he drew a larger share of the vote than he had received in the 2016 election, partly by making inroads with the state's Latino communities.Sherrill courted those voters who have traditionally favored Democrats, in part by speaking Spanish on the campaign trail and in TV ads.She has also run a campaign centered on affordability, hewing to Democrats' broader messaging strategy.\"Vote Here Today\" signage outside a polling location at Hillside Elementary School in Montclair, New Jersey, US, on Tuesday, Nov. 4, 2025. John Lamparski | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesCiattarelli, whom Trump endorsed, ran a campaign that echoed much of the president's MAGA agenda.The election came in the middle of a protracted federal government shutdown, for which Americans blame Republicans and Trump more than Democrats, polls show.Both candidates raised over $20 million and spent nearly $17 million heading into the final stretch of the race.Despite suffering demoralizing losses in 2024 and grappling with persistently low approval ratings, Democrats have reasons to be optimistic about the 2026 cycle.Read more CNBC politics coverageNYC mayoral election: Mamdani, Cuomo, Sliwa fight to replace Adams as Trump weighs inNJ governor election: Sherrill and Ciattarelli face off in close race as Trump, Obama weigh inVirginia governor election: Spanberger and Earle-Sears vie to succeed YoungkinSNAP update: Trump admin will pay 50% of food stamp benefits in November amid shutdownTrump says he has 'no idea who' Binance's CZ is after pardoning himTrump backtracks on attending Supreme Court tariffs case argumentsTrump's approval ratings have fallen precipitously since the start of his term and are lower than where they stood at this point in his first term, according to multiple polls.Anti-Trump sentiment has been a galvanizing force for Democrats in the past and present, notably at the recent \"No Kings\" protests that drew millions of participants across the country.This is developing news.

    "body": "Pedestrians carry Cava bags along Wall Street near the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York, US, on Monday, Aug. 18, 2025. Michael Nagle | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesCava on Tuesday cut its full-year forecast for the second straight quarter as younger consumers visit its restaurants less frequently.\"When you look at different age demographics of fast casual, the 25- to 34-year-old consumer seems to be impacted a bit more than others, and fast casual tends to have a higher concentration of those consumers within their guest portfolio,\" CFO Tricia Tolivar said in an interview, adding that the company saw demand fall as it entered the final quarter of the year.She attributed the pullback from younger consumers to the demographic's higher unemployment rate, plus a higher likelihood of facing the student loan repayments that resumed in the spring. Moreover, tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump \"created an overall fog for the consumer,\" according to Tolivar.Fast-casual rival Chipotle Mexican Grill reported similar behavior from the same age cohort when it released its third-quarter earnings on Wednesday.For 2025, Cava is now projecting that its same-store sales will increase 3% to 4%, down from its prior outlook of 4% to 6% growth. The company also expects lower restaurant-level profit margins, decreasing its projections to a range of 24.4% to 24.8%, down from the previous forecast of 24.8% to 25.2%.Cava shares fell 5% in extended trading. As of Tuesday's close, the stock has tumbled 54% this year.Here's what the company reported for the quarter ended Oct. 5 compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:Earnings per share: 12 cents adjusted, in line with expectationsRevenue: $292.2 million vs. $292.6 million expectedCava's same-store sales rose 1.9%, falling short of Wall Street's expectations of 2.8%, according to StreetAccount estimates. The chain's traffic was flat compared with the year-ago period, but menu price increases and a higher mix of premium protein options boosted sales.Despite slower same-store sales growth, Cava is gaining market share, according to Tolivar. That fact suggests that consumers who are 25- to 34-years old may be cooking at home or packing their lunches, rather than trading down to fast food.\"It appears that the consumer is being more thoughtful around their dining occasions, and how frequently they are doing that,\" Tolivar said.Unlike Chipotle and the broader restaurant industry, Cava is seeing higher same-store sales growth from low-income consumers; Tolivar credited the chain's choice to keep its menu prices below inflation, presenting a more affordable option for budget-conscious consumers.Cava's net sales climbed 20% to $292.2 million, fueled by new restaurant openings. Since the third quarter of last year, Cava has opened a net 74 locations, bringing its total footprint up to 415, as of Oct. 5.The Mediterranean chain reported fiscal third-quarter net income of $14.7 million, or 12 cents per share, down from $18 million, or 15 cents per share, a year earlier.Excluding executive transition costs and other items, Cava earned 12 cents per share.",

    "body": "A Peloton stationary bicycle inside a store in Palo Alto, California, US, on Monday, Aug. 5, 2024. David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesPeloton on Thursday posted its second profitable quarter in a row as it released strong guidance for the crucial holiday shopping season, banking on its relaunched product assortment to drive growth. The connected fitness company posted a surprise net income of $13.9 million in the three months ended Sept. 30, compared with a loss of $900,000 a year earlier. For the current quarter, Peloton's strongest for hardware sales, the company is expecting revenue to be between $665 million and $685 million, a slight increase from the year-ago period and largely better than Wall Street expectations of $665 million, according to LSEG. Peloton also raised its full-year adjusted EBITDA outlook and is now expecting it to be between $425 million and $475 million, up $25 million from its previous outlook on both ends. Much of that forecast is ahead of analyst expectations of between $400 million and $450 million, according to StreetAccount. Shares jumped about 11% in extended trading Thursday.Despite the good news, Peloton is still dealing with issues from its past. Earlier on Thursday, it said it was initiating yet another recall from its early product lineup. The Consumer Product Safety Commission said the company was recalling 833,000 of its original Bike+ devices after receiving reports that the seat post can break and detach during a ride – the same issue that prompted a recall of its base Bike model in 2023. \"We have received a small number of reports of an original series Bike+ seat post breaking during use. As of today, we are aware of three such incidents,\" Peloton CEO Peter Stern said on the company's earnings call Thursday.Peloton's latest recall cost the company $13.5 million during the quarter reported Thursday, contributing to a 0.3 percentage point decline in its gross margin.For its first fiscal 2026 quarter reported Thursday, Peloton beat analyst expectations on the top and bottom lines. Here's how the fitness company did in its first fiscal quarter compared with what Wall Street was anticipating, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:Earnings per share: 3 cents vs. 0 cents expectedRevenue: $551 million vs. $540 million expectedSales dropped to $551 million, down about 6% from $586 million a year earlier. Under the direction of Stern, who took the helm in January, the connected fitness company has been finalizing its cost cuts and turning its attention back to growth now that it's back to regularly generating free cash flow and operating profitably. \"Our intent is to go well beyond [cardio connected fitness]... we've got strength, we've got mental, mental wellbeing, nutrition and hydration and sleep and recovery,\" Stern said. \"We are focused on growth, but the growth needs to be profitable … both in top line growth as well as increased margins associated with that business as well.\"Last month, Peloton relaunched its product assortment, introduced a commercial equipment line and raised prices for both subscriptions and hardware ahead of the holiday shopping season. The revamped assortment, touching its bike, rowing machine and treadmill products, features an AI-powered tracking camera, speakers, a 360-degree swivel screen and hands-free control, among other new features. \"Our launch of an entirely new product lineup with the cross training series, is a great reason for us to talk to our members and nonmembers alike,\" Stern said.Peloton is betting consumers will be willing to spend big on the products for flashy holiday gifts, either for themselves or a loved one. But just over a month into the launch, it remains unclear how they're performing. The company's first fiscal quarter ended the day before the new products were launched. Across the retail industry, the personal electronics category has been under pressure. While Peloton operates in a category of its own, shoppers have been pulling back on other big-ticket items and being more careful about where their dollars are going in an unsteady economic environment. After Peloton's last recall, the company said at the time that it saw higher-than-expected membership churn and costs as a result.– CNBC's Luke Fountain contributed to this report",

QantasAustralia's Qantas on Friday revealed the first images of the specially configured Airbus aircraft set to enable the world's longest commercial flights.The A350-1000ULR (Ultra Long Range) aircraft was depicted on the assembly line in Toulouse, France, with its fuselage sections, wings, tail section and landing gear now all attached.The aircraft, which is designed to connect travelers in Sydney to London and New York for the first time, will move to a new hangar this week where it will have engines and flight test instruments installed, Qantas said.The transfer comes ahead of an extensive test flight program due to start next year, with the first commercial services scheduled for the first half of 2027.Qantas CEO Vanessa Hudson said the progress brings \"Project Sunrise\" one step closer to reality. The project name is a reference to the airline's \"Double Sunrise\" endurance flights during World War II, which remained airborne long enough to see two sunrises.Qantas and Airbus have released the first images of its A350-1000ULR (Ultra Long Range) aircraft.QantasQantas said the A350-1000ULR aircraft will be capable of flying for up to 22 hours non-stop due to an additional 20,000 liter rear center fuel tank and enhanced systems.It expects the direct services to cut up to four hours off total travel time when compared to the one-stop services for travelers flying from Australia to the U.S. or U.K. on offer today.Ultra long-haul flights, which typically refer to journeys of more than 16 hours, have become technically possible due to more efficient engines and aircraft, but they face other challenges. For instance, analysts have raised concerns over passenger comfort, as well as the environmental impact of these flights.Shares of Qantas fell 6.5% on Friday, notching a six-month low as guidance disappointed investors. The airline said it expected its domestic revenue to grow by roughly 3% in the first half of next year, at the lower end of the guidance range provided in a previous forecast.Paris-listed shares of Airbus, meanwhile, were slightly lower during early morning deals. The stock is up more than 35% year-to-date.",

    "body": "Tesla CEO Elon Musk attends the Saudi-U.S. Investment Forum, in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, May 13, 2025. Hamad I Mohammed | ReutersTesla CEO Elon Musk says the company will likely need to build a \"gigantic\" semiconductor fabrication plant to keep up with its artificial intelligence and robotics ambitions.\"One of the things I'm trying to figure out is — how do we make enough chips?\" Musk said at Tesla's annual shareholders meeting Thursday.Tesla currently relies on contract chipmakers Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company and Samsung Electronics to produce its chip designs. Musk said he was also considering working with U.S. chip company Intel. \"But even when we extrapolate the best-case scenario for chip production from our suppliers, it's still not enough,\" he said.Tesla would probably need to build a \"gigantic\"  chip fab, which Musk described as a \"Tesla terra fab.\" \"I can't see any other way to get to the volume of chips that we're looking for.\" Microchips are the brains that power almost all modern technologies, including everything from consumer electronics like smartphones to massive data centers, and demand for them has been surging amid the AI boom.Tech giants, including Tesla, have been clamoring for more supply from chipmakers like TSMC — the world's largest and most advanced chipmaker. According to Musk, Tesla's potential fab's initial capacity would reach 100,000 wafer starts per month and eventually scale up to 1 million. In the semiconductor industry, wafer starts per month is a measure of how many new chips a fab produces each month.For comparison, TSMC says its annual wafer production capacity reached 17 million in 2024, or around 1.42 million wafer starts per month.While Tesla doesn't yet manufacture its own microchips, the company has been designing custom chips for autonomous driving for several years.It is currently outsourcing production of its latest-generation \"AI5\" chip, which Musk said will be cheaper, power-efficient, and optimized for Tesla's AI software.The CEO also announced on Thursday that Tesla will begin producing its Cybercab — an autonomous electric vehicle with no pedals or steering wheel — in April.Musk's statements underscore Tesla's shift into AI and robotics — industries the CEO sees as the future of the global economy. \"With AI and robotics, you can actually increase the global economy by a factor of 10, or maybe 100. There's not, like, an obvious limit,\" Musk said at the shareholder meeting. ",

    "body": "The Ford Lightning is seen at the New York International Auto Show on April 16, 2025.Danielle DeVries | CNBCDETROIT — Ford Motor is reportedly considering ending production of its all-electric F-150 Lightning pickup truck amid mounting losses and more challenging market conditions for EVs.The Wall Street Journal first reported the talks Thursday, adding they are ongoing and nothing has been finalized. A source familiar with Ford's product strategy confirmed to CNBC that the company has been evaluating its future EVs amid the company's losses and changing market conditions.\"What I can say is that F-150 Lightning is the best-selling electric pickup truck in the U.S. — despite new competition from CyberTruck, Chevy, GMC, Hummer and Rivian — and delivered record sales in Q3. Right now, we're focused on producing F-150 ICE and Hybrid as we recover from the fire at Novelis,\" a Ford spokesman said in an emailed statement Thursday, declining to comment on the discussions.Ford previously confirmed it paused production of the Lightning amid supply chain disruptions related to a fire at an aluminum plant for Novelis, a main supplier for the pickup truck.Ford President Kumar Galhotra, when asked last month by media about Lightning production potentially ending, said the company's main priority was gas-powered models. He said F-150 Lightning production could restart whenever the company would like but declined to give a timeframe.The F-150 Lightning, which Ford once said was as important to the company as founder Henry Ford's Model T, never lived up to internal or external expectations. The pickup initially received more than 200,000 nonbinding reservations that failed to convert to sales.F-150 Lightning sales this year through October are roughly level compared with a year earlier at only 24,577 units. Since going on sale in 2022 in the U.S., Ford has sold less than 100,000 F-150 Lightning models.The Lightning is produced at a facility connected to a large F-150 production plant in metro Detroit.Ford's EV operations, including the Lightning, have lost the company billions of dollars annually in recent years.The U.S. EV market has faced daunting changes in regulations under the Trump administration this year, including the end of consumer credits of up to $7,500 for the purchase of an EV.The reported discussions at Ford follow crosstown rival Stellantis deciding to end plans to produce an all-electric Ram 1500 pickup as well as General Motors significantly scaling back its plans for electric trucks.",

    "body": "Shoppers carry bags at Broadway Plaza in Walnut Creek, California, US, on Monday, Dec. 16, 2024. The Bureau of Economic Analysis is scheduled to release personal spending figures on December 20. David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesHoliday hiring by retailers is expected to total between 265,000 and 365,000 roles this year, the lowest number of seasonal workers in at least 15 years, the National Retail Federation said Thursday.NRF CEO Matthew Shay said on the retail trade group's conference call on that those hiring expectations \"reflect the softening and slowing labor market.\" It's a significant drop from a year ago, when retailers hired 442,000 seasonal workers, the retail trade group said.Some companies may have hired seasonal workers early to support sales events in October, but retailers have largely tried to limit their spending as they manage higher costs from tariffs, NRF chief economist Mark Mathews said.The major industry group's prediction offers the latest glimpse into the jobs market as the record government shutdown stretches on and leads to fewer government reports on economic data, such as unemployment and inflation. That's caused companies and economists to rely on data from private companies or organizations instead.Earlier Thursday, outplacement firm Challenger, Gray and Christmas said layoff announcements soared in October to 153,074, a 183% jump from September and 175% surge from the same month a year ago. That marked the highest level for any October since 2003, and 2025 has been the worst year for announced layoffs since 2009.On the other hand, payrolls processing firm ADP reported net job growth in October of 42,000, reversing two consecutive months of losses in the private sector.Higher spending, lower hiringEven with the lower levels of seasonal staffing, the NRF is optimistic holiday spending will be strong. It said it expects holiday spending to hit a record of between $1.1 trillion to $1.2 trillion from Nov. 1 through Dec. 31, the first time the total would top $1 trillion.That would represent 3.7% to 4.2% year-over-year growth from the previous holiday season, a slight decrease from last year's 4.3% holiday sales growth rate. NRF's forecast excludes auto dealers, gas stations and restaurants.Even with low consumer sentiment, a prolonged government shutdown, \"on-again-off-again tariffs\" and price sensitivity because of inflation, Shay said consumers have defied expectations and kept spending.\"In fairness, that's been somewhat of a surprise based on where we thought we might be way back in April,\" he said.He said the trade group anticipates that dynamic will persist during the key holiday shopping season. Households typically cut back during other parts of the year or on other parts of the budget to make it a festive time, he said.Even as consumers continue to spend, the retail industry has taken a cautious stance on hiring — a fact reflected in NRF's predictions for seasonal workers. It is the fourth slowest year for retail hiring on a year-to-date basis since at least 2000, behind only 2009, 2010 and 2012, several of the years following the Great Recession.Mathews told CNBC in an interview that the slow hiring environment all comes down to one word: uncertainty.\"The one thing you know businesses do when they are in uncertain environments is they put things on hold,\" he told CNBC in an interview.On NRF's conference call on Thursday, Mathews said the U.S. economy doesn't need the same level of job creation as it used to because of demographic and policy shifts, including the retirement of Baby Boomers and President Donald Trump's crackdown on immigration.Still, he said, the level of hiring and investment by companies will be an important indicator to watch in the coming year.Right now, he said, a flood of investment in artificial intelligence has been \"a huge boon for the economy.\" But he added \"that may be covering up a few cracks.\"\"We need to keep a close eye on on how businesses are feeling and what remains an uncertain environment,\" he said.",

Al Drago | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesMcDonald's leadership is urging operators to stay the course on value offerings as the competition for consumers plays out across the restaurant space. In a memo to U.S. operators following the company's third-quarter earnings, McDonald's U.S. President Joe Erlinger said the brand was \"moving in the right direction\" as it continues a more-than-yearlong push on value.\"Amid industry pressures, dynamic change, and aggressive competition, winning the fight for contracting traffic means staying customer-obsessed,\" Erlinger wrote in the memo, which was viewed by CNBC. The company did not immediately respond to request for comment.On Wednesday, McDonald's reported earnings per share and revenue that came in below Wall Street expectations, but its same-store sales were a bright spot, posting positive growth across all segments. U.S. same-store sales increased more than anticipated, up 2.4%, thanks to a boost from the $2.99 Snack Wrap launch and the introduction of its Extra Value Meals, which Erlinger said drew week-to-week growth.\"While we maintained a positive comp guest count gap, overall [guest counts] continue to decline-- underscoring the need for disciplined pricing, value, and affordability,\" he wrote in the memo.Erlinger said the company has \"the right plan in place\" and said it was poised for a strong fourth quarter, including the benefit of annual comparisons to last year's E. coli outbreak that dented burger sales. \"We still need to keep our foot on the gas-- staying focused on the customer and what we can control,\" he said. CEO Chris Kempczinski told analysts this week that the fast-food chain is seeing signs of a bifurcated consumer base among quick-service restaurants. He noted \"QSR traffic from lower-income consumers declining nearly double-digits in the third quarter, a trend that's persisted for nearly two years. \"In contrast, QSR traffic growth among higher-income consumers remains strong, increasing nearly double-digits in the quarter. We continue to remain cautious about the health of the consumer in the U.S. and our top international markets, and believe the pressures will continue well into 2026,\" he said.In a separate memo to global operators, Kempczinski said the brand will continue to focus on \"sharpening value leadership to meet evolving consumer expectations and increase traffic.\"He added McDonald's will be \"investing in high-potential menu categories-- especially Chicken and Beverages-- to stay competitive and drive growth.\"McDonald's is currently testing beverages in 500 restaurants across Wisconsin and Colorado that draw on learnings from its now-shuttered beverage concept, CosMc's.watch now",

    "body": "The National Thanksgiving turkeys, Blossom and Peach, wait before being pardoned by U.S. President Joe Biden during a ceremony on the South Lawn of the White House on November 25, 2024 in Washington, DC. Andrew Harnik | Getty ImagesThe price of turkeys is soaring this Thanksgiving, and experts say consumers will have to hunt around to find a bargain for those birds.Driving the price hikes is a stressed turkey supply chain.The U.S. turkey flock has dropped to its lowest size in nearly 40 years because of the highly pathogenic avian influenza, according to the American Farm Bureau Federation.As a result, wholesale turkey prices have surged 75% since October 2024, according to an analysis by the Purdue University College of Agriculture.Wholesale turkey prices averaged 94 cents per pound at that point last year, compared with $1.71 per pound last month, according to U.S. Department of Agriculture data.Purdue University's model predicts that the average retail price of a turkey will be approximately $2.05 per pound in November, which is 25% higher than a year ago, costing consumers about $31 for a 15-pound bird.Purdue analysts emphasized that the actual retail price range of turkeys is wide because of differences in quality — organic or pasture-raised turkeys cost more.The timing of the turkey orders by retailers also is critical in determining price.\"Retailers that didn't secure their turkey orders early may face steep spot market prices, which could impact availability and cost,\" wrote Dr. Michael Swanson, chief agricultural economist for the Wells Fargo Agri-Food Institute.\"In contrast, those who waited may now be facing steep spot market prices,\" Swanson said.Spencer Platt | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesConsumers could end up paying $20 more for a 16-pound turkey if they buy it from a retailer who purchased it on the spot market, compared with what it would cost at a retailer who purchased the turkey earlier on the wholesale market.\"This year, where you shop could make a big difference, and savvy consumers may find significant savings by comparing options,\" Swanson said.Major retailers who placed early orders appear to be leveraging their turkeys as a draw to bring shoppers into stores, according to Swanson.Walmart is offering a dinner bundle, which includes a 16-pound turkey and sides, for under $56 for 10 people.A Thanksgiving bundle from Aldi's sells for $40 and feeds 10 people. Amazon is offering its own Thanksgiving dinner promotion for $25. Target on Wednesday announced a $20 Thanksgiving deal for four.Other grocers, such as ShopRite and Foodtown, are offering customers a free 10-to-20-pound store-brand turkey if they spend $400 by Thanksgiving. BJ's is running a similar promotion for $150.Wells Fargo's annual Thanksgiving food report shows that the typical cost of a turkey dinner for consumers is higher than those deals. A holiday menu that uses all store-brand items costs $80, while a menu with all national name brands totals $95, Wells Fargo's report said.\"Our report shows consumers spending more this Thanksgiving than on the retail promotions because we lean into a mix of prepared items and items that need assembly, which cost more versus making items from scratch,\" Swanson said.\"That mix in our view, more accurately portrays what we expect consumers to use for the meal this year.\"  In addition to the timing of purchases, the strength of supply-chain relationships between grocers and the farmers they work with has enabled some retailers to keep turkey prices from soaring.Customers push shopping carts outside a Stew Leonard's supermarket in Paramus, New Jersey, U.S., on Tuesday, May 12, 2020. Stew Leonard Jr. said that meat packing plant the company uses is operating at about 70 percent capacity, and he expects it to rebound to full capacity in about a month, CT Post reported.Angus Mordant | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesStew Leonard's — which operates a small chain of grocery stores in Connecticut, New York and New Jersey — said it was able to keep its turkey prices the same as last year because of its longstanding relationship with its bird supplier.\"We have been working with the same farm for decades, and the farm hasn't been impacted by bird flu,\" said Stew Leonard Jr., the chain's CEO.Thanksgiving dinner traditionally is considered one of the most affordable holiday meals, because red meat is not typically served.But given the increase in turkey prices, Leonard said, ham is a good alternative option for a Thanksgiving main course.Consumers could also opt to go to a butcher or store that will sell dark turkey meat or parts, which would cost less than a whole bird, he said.The reduction in flock size has led to layoffs for poultry producers.Perdue Farms in September announced it was laying off nearly 300 employees at an Indiana turkey plant, reportedly because of bird flu and a consumer shift toward other meats.One farmer who supplies Perdue said he lost 48,000 turkeys after a flu test came back positive.The USDA is forecasting an increase in turkey production in 2026, assuming the avian flu abates.But because of the current size of the flock, prices are not expected to drop considerably in 2026.The top eight states for turkey production are Minnesota, North Carolina, Arkansas, Indiana, Missouri, Virginia, Iowa and Pennsylvania. Turkey farms in North Dakota and South Dakota were hit with an outbreak of the flu in September.No new data on turkeys and agriculture is expected to be released by the USDA due to the government shutdown, which on Wednesday became the longest shutdown in U.S. history.",

    "body": "Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program (SNAP) signage at a grocery store in Dorchester, Massachusetts, US, on Monday, Nov. 3, 2025. Mel Musto | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesA federal judge on Thursday ordered the Trump administration to pay full SNAP benefits for November by Friday, rejecting the administration's plan to partially fund the food stamp program for 42 million Americans during the U.S. government shutdown.\"People have gone without for too long,\" Judge Jack McConnell said during a hearing in U.S. District Court in Rhode Island, where he issued the order.McConnell said the Trump administration, which had already agreed to tap a congressionally authorized contingency fund to pay partial SNAP benefits, must also use so-called Section 32 funds that it had refused to tap earlier this week.\"The evidence shows that people will go hungry, food pantries will be overburdened, and needless suffering will occur\" if SNAP is not fully funded, said McConnell.He noted in a written order that more than half of the program's recipients are children, seniors and veterans.\"While the President of the United States professes a commitment to helping those it serves, the government's actions tell a different story,\" McConnell wrote.\"Faced with a choice between advancing relief and entrenching delay, it chose the latter — an outcome that predictably magnifies harm and undermines the very purpose of the program it administers.\"The order came after plaintiffs in the case urged him to reject the plan to pay only partial benefits, which the administration disclosed in a court filing in Providence on Monday.The Trump administration later Thursday asked the 1st Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals to overturn the judge's new order, as well as an order he issued Friday directing the administration to make partial benefit payments as soon as possible.McConnell at the hearing pointed to a Truth Social post by President Donald Trump, who on Tuesday said that SNAP benefits \"will be given only when the Radical Left Democrats open up government, which they can easily do, and not before!\"Trump's post seemed to contradict statements by administration lawyers that the benefits would be partially paid for the month.The White House later said there was no change in that plan, but also said it would take time to issue the partial benefits to recipients.McConnell said that Trump's post was effectively an admission that the administration intended to defy his prior order to seek out all possible funding sources so that full benefits could be paid.The Trump administration last week said it would not use the contingency fund containing $4.65 billion to fund the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program in November. The total cost of full SNAP benefits for the month is around $8 billion.The program, like other federal programs, has no currently appropriated money, as a result of Congress failing to pass a spending bill. That failure led to the U.S. government shutting down on Oct. 1.Past presidential administrations have continued paying SNAP benefits during prior shutdowns.A group of cities, charitable and faith-based non-profit groups, unions, and business organizations sued the administration, seeking to force it to use the contingency funds and potentially other money to fund SNAP.Read more CNBC government shutdown coverage Government shutdown could cost U.S. economy up to $14 billion, CBO saysJudge extends ban on Trump firing federal workers during government shutdownStates sue Trump admin to keep SNAP benefits during government shutdownLargest federal worker union urges end to government shutdownTrump's $130 million mystery military donor is Timothy Mellon: NYTGovernment shutdown becomes second-longest in U.S. historyStates sue Trump administration to keep SNAP benefits Government shutdown becomes 2nd longest in U.S. historyHow to get student loan help during the government shutdownWhite House economic advisor Hassett says shutdown could end this weekArmy Corps of Engineers pausing $11 billion in projects over shutdown: VoughtGovernment shutdown: Trump distrust keeps Democrats from forming 'gang'Bill to fund military during government shutdown fails in Senate procedural voteMcConnell, during a court hearing last Friday, blocked the administration from halting SNAP benefits and ordered that it pay benefits from the contingency fund \"as soon as possible,\" and investigate whether other funds could be tapped to fully fund the program for the month.On Monday, the administration told McConnell it would pay 50% of the benefits by using the contingency fund. But it ruled out using at least $4 billion from the Child Nutrition Program, as well as other sources.On Wednesday night, the administration updated its plan, saying that 65% of the benefits would be paid.McConnell at Thursday's hearing blasted the U.S. Department of Agriculture for refusing to use the Nutrition Program's funds to help fully pay November's benefits, calling that decision \"arbitrary and capricious.\"\"USDA had an obligation, beginning ... Oct. 1, when the shutdown began, to prepare to use the contingency funds so that the recipients would get their benefits as expected on Nov. 1,\" McConnell said.\"USDA did not do so,\" he said. \"Even when Nov. 1 came, USDA refused to use the congressionally mandated contingency funds, USDA cannot now cry that it cannot get timely payments to beneficiaries for weeks or months because states are not prepared to make partial payments.\"Earlier Thursday, a coalition of around two dozen states asked another federal judge, in Boston, to order the administration to fully fund SNAP benefits. McConnell's order came before that judge had time to rule on that request.New York Attorney General Letitia James, whose state is one of the plaintiffs in the Boston suit, in a statement said, \"A judge in Rhode Island just stopped the federal government from starving millions of Americans.\"\"I am relieved that people will get the food they need, but it is outrageous that it took a lawsuit to make the federal government feed its own people,\" James said.",

    "body": "OpenAI CEO Sam Altman speaks to media following a Q&amp;A at the OpenAI data center in Abilene, Texas, U.S., Sept. 23, 2025.  Shelby Tauber | ReutersOpenAI CEO Sam Altman said Thursday that the artificial intelligence startup is on track to generate more than $20 billion in annualized revenue run rate this year, with plans to grow to hundreds of billions in sales by 2030.The company has inked more than $1.4 trillion of infrastructure deals in recent months to try and build out the data centers it says are needed to meet growing demand. The staggering sum has raised questions from investors and others in the industry about where OpenAI will come up with the money.\"We are trying to build the infrastructure for a future economy powered by AI, and given everything we see on the horizon in our research program, this is the time to invest to be really scaling up our technology,\" Altman wrote in a post on X. \"Massive infrastructure projects take quite awhile to build, so we have to start now.\"OpenAI was founded as a nonprofit research lab in 2015, but has become one of the fastest-growing commercial entities on the planet following the launch of its chatbot ChatGPT in 2022. The startup is currently valued at $500 billion, though it's still not profitable.In September, OpenAI CFO Sarah Friar told CNBC that OpenAI was on track to generate $13 billion in revenue this year.Friar caught the attention of the Trump administration this week after she saying at at event that OpenAI is looking to create an ecosystem of banks, private equity and a federal \"backstop\" or \"guarantee\" that could help the company finance its investments in cutting-edge chips. She clarified those comments late Wednesday, writing in a post on LinkedIn that OpenAI is not seeking a government backstop for its infrastructure commitments.\"I used the word 'backstop' and it muddied the point,\" Friar wrote. \"As the full clip of my answer shows, I was making the point that American strength in technology will come from building real industrial capacity which requires the private sector and government playing their part.\"Venture capitalist David Sacks, who is serving as President Donald Trump's AI and crypto czar, said Thursday that there will be \"no federal bailout for AI.\" He wrote in a post on X that if one frontier model company in the U.S. fails, another will take its place.Altman said Thursday that OpenAI does \"not have or want government guarantees for OpenAI datacenters.\" He said taxpayers should not bail out companies that make poor decisions, and that \"if we get it wrong, that's on us.\"\"This is the bet we are making, and given our vantage point, we feel good about it,\" Altman wrote. \"But we of course could be wrong, and the market—not the government—will deal with it if we are.\"WATCH: Trump AI czar David Sacks says ‘no federal bailout for AI’ after OpenAI CFO’s commentswatch now",

    "body": "The Omada Health logo is displayed on a smartphone screen.Sopa Images | Lightrocket | Getty ImagesVirtual care company Omada Health on Thursday said it will start prescribing GLP-1s and other obesity drugs and helping patients manage those medications.Omada plans to expand the offerings under its weight management program as its membership grows to more than 800,000.The announcement comes as digital health companies increase their presence in the blockbuster market for GLP-1s to treat obesity, diabetes and other chronic conditions – a space that could be worth roughly $100 billion by the end of the decade, according to some analysts. Several digital health companies similarly offer prescriptions for GLP-1s, and the manufacturers of those drugs, Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk, are taking steps to make their treatments more accessible while also developing new ones for patients.\"The announcement is in response to our belief that access to GLP-1s will grow pretty significantly over time,\" Omada co-founder and CEO Sean Duffy said in an interview. He said Omada recognizes that the market will expand beyond GLP-1 injections to pills and other \"next-generation\" treatments that work in different ways, underscoring the need to help patients manage their medications. Programs from companies like Omada aim to support lifestyle and behavioral changes for patients on those drugs, offering nutrition guidance, education and a team of health coaches and exercise specialists, among other resources, that can help people stay on the drugs longer. But Omada is now tapping licensed providers trained in obesity care to prescribe medications and help patients manage the drugs. The new offering will allow the company to support patients as they receive a prescription and through the time they spend on a GLP-1. That kind of support is crucial, as GLP-1 injections can be complicated for patients to use properly and often come with gastrointestinal side effects that force some people to stop treatment.\"If you need to go up in dose, down in those, switch medications – you name it. We'll be able to support you through this experience,\" Duffy said.Omada, which partners with national and regional health plans and employers, also said the new offering is an add-on for customers to better support their workers' health needs while controlling costs and improving results from obesity treatments. Also on Thursday, Omada Health reported quarterly earnings for the second time since its initial public offering in June.The company, founded in 2011, offers virtual care programs to support patients with chronic conditions such as prediabetes, diabetes and hypertension. Omada describes its approach as a \"between-visit care model\" that is complementary to the broader health-care ecosystem.",

As a result Indian and Chinese refiners have started to cut down imports of Russian oil.According to a Reuters report on Thursday, Russian oil is trading at its steepest discounts to Brent in a year in Asia, as major Indian and Chinese refiners reduce purchases.India's Petroleum and Natural Gas ministry did not immediately respond to CNBC's query on the country cutting Russian oil imports.\"Over the long term, completely phasing out Russian oil isn't realistic for India,\" said Prateek Pandey head of APAC oil and gas research at Rystad Energy, adding that as Russian crude becomes available at a sharper discount \"New Delhi's approach of \"economics first\" will be tested more than ever.",

U.S. Attorney for D.C. Jeanine Pirro's prosecutors previously failed to get a grand jury in D.C. to indict the 37-year-old on a felony assault charge. Pirro's office then filed a misdemeanor charge against him, which went to trial this week. Jurors began deliberations on Wednesday.Dunn was charged in connection with tossing a sandwich at Customs and Border Protection Officer Greg Lairmore on on Aug. 10 along the U Street nightlife corridor in Washington.Lairmore and other federal authorities were deployed in D.C. by President Donald Trump in response to what the president claimed was rampant crime in the capital city.\"F--- you! You f---ing fascists! Why are you here? I don't want you in my city!\" Dunn allegedly shouted at a group of federal officers before hurling the sandwich at one of them. Dunn was fired by the DOJ, where he worked in the criminal division's international affairs section, after his arrest.A person walks past art work depicting former DOJ employee Sean Charles Dunn is displayed against a restaurant wall on August 17, 2025 in the Adams Morgan neighborhood of Washington. Tom Brenner | The Washington Post | Getty ImagesDunn's attorney, Sabrina Shroff, during closing arguments on Wednesday said that the confrontation was the result of his \"strongly held feelings\" about immigration enforcement, NBC News reported.Shroff also told jurors that \"you are the ones impacted by the executive orders\" issued by Trump which put federal law enforcement officers on the streets of D.C., NBC reported.\"You are the ones impacted by the executive orders … there was and remains a huge law enforcement presence in the district,' Shroff said.The defense attorney also argued that the, \"The sandwich did not impede Officer Lairmore's duties that night ....  A footlong from Subway could not and certainly did not inflict bodily harm,\" NBC reported.Shroff also noted that Lairmore had received two \"gag gifts\" from co-workers, a plush sandwich and a patch featuring a cartoon of Dunn throwing the sandwich with the words \"Felony Footlong,' according to the outlet.\"If someone assaulted you, if someone offended you, would you keep a  memento of their assault? Would you stick it on your daily lunchbox and carry it with you day in and day out?\" she asked.",

Brian Snyder | ReutersVenture capitalist David Sacks, who is serving as President Donald Trump's artificial intelligence and crypto czar, said Thursday that there will be \"no federal bailout for AI.\"\"The U.S. has at least 5 major frontier model companies. If one fails, others will take its place,\" Sacks wrote in a post on X.Sacks' comments came after OpenAI CFO Sarah Friar said Wednesday that the startup wants to establish an ecosystem of private equity, banks and a federal \"backstop\" or \"guarantee\" that could help the company finance its infrastructure investments.She softened her stance later in a LinkedIn post and said OpenAI is not seeking a government backstop for its infrastructure commitments. She said her use of the word \"backstop\" clouded her point.\"As the full clip of my answer shows, I was making the point that American strength in technology will come from building real industrial capacity which requires the private sector and government playing their part,\" Friar wrote.The White House did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment. OpenAI directed CNBC to Friar's LinkedIn post.Sacks said the Trump administration does want to make permitting and power generation easier, and that the goal is to facilitate rapid infrastructure buildouts without raising residential electricity rates.\"To give benefit of the doubt, I don't think anyone was actually asking for a bailout. (That would be ridiculous.),\" he wrote.Read more CNBC tech newsElon Musk expected to prevail in Tesla shareholder vote over CEO's $1 trillion pay planMatthew McConaughey, Ryan Reynolds-backed password manager tops $400 million in ARR on AI tail windsNvidia's Jensen Huang softens his 'China will win the AI race' remark to FTQualcomm reports earnings, revenue beat and issues strong forecastwatch now",

US President Donald Trump said he would be imposing tariffs on semiconductor imports \"very shortly\" but spare goods from companies like Apple Inc. that have pledged to boost their US investments. Photographer: Will Oliver/EPA/Bloomberg via Getty ImagesWill Oliver | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesMeta projected that 10% of its overall sales in 2024, or about $16 billion, came from running online ads for scams and banned goods, according to a Thursday report from Reuters. Those kinds of ads included promotions for \"fraudulent e-commerce and investment schemes, illegal online casinos and the sale of banned medical products,\" according to the Reuters report, which was based on internal company documents. Those documents showed the company's attempts to measure the prevalence of fraudulent advertising on its apps like Facebook and Instagram. Meta brought in more than $164.5 billion in overall sales for 2024. Last week, the company said that third-quarter sales rose 26% year-over-year to $51.24 billion and that it lifted the low end of its total expenses for the year by $2 billion as part of its massive investments into artificial intelligence.The Reuters report cited a December 2024 document that showed how Meta each year generates roughly $7 billion in annualized sales from so-called \"higher risk\" scam ads, which are promotions that are clearly deceptive. Each day, Meta shows users an estimated 15 billion of these higher risk scam ads, the Reuters report said, citing a separate document.Although some of the documents show that Meta aims to reduce the amount of bogus ads on its platform, the Reuters report also said that other documents suggest the company is concerned that its business projections could be impacted by any abrupt removal of the fraudulent promotions.A Meta spokesperson said that the company \"aggressively\" addresses scam and fraud ads on its apps. The projections that 10% of the company's 2024 ad sales came from bunk ads \"was a rough and overly-inclusive estimate rather than a definitive or final figure; in fact, subsequent review revealed that many of these ads weren't violating at all,\" the spokesperson said in a statement.\"Unfortunately, the leaked documents present a selective view that distorts Meta's approach to fraud and scams by focusing on our efforts to assess the scale of the challenge, not the full range of actions we have taken to address the problem,\" the spokesperson said.WATCH: Wall Street backs AI winners, and Meta's not one of them this quarter.watch now",

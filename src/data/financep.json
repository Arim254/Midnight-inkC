    "body": "Michael Burry attends the New York premiere of \"The Big Short\" at the Ziegfeld Theater in New York City on Nov. 23, 2015.Jim Spellman | WireImage | Getty ImagesRenowned investor Michael Burry on Wednesday denied shorting Tesla's shares after calling the EV maker \"ridiculously overvalued.\" In a social media post on X, the Scion Asset Management founder responded to a user asking if he would bet against Tesla, saying: \"I am not short.\" Burry, who earned his reputation by successfully predicting the collapse of the U.S. housing market that led to the 2008 global financial crisis, clarified his position after describing Tesla as \"ridiculously overvalued\" in a separate post.\"The Big Short\" investor made the same assessment of Tesla's stock valuation to subscribers of his new paid Substack newsletter earlier in the month. Burry recently made headlines with a tech short bet. He said some of America's largest companies were using aggressive accounting to inflate their supposed profits from the AI boom.Burry's latest comments on Tesla come shortly after the company took the unusual step of publishing sales estimates that appear to indicate a lower-than-expected outlook for its vehicle deliveries.Read moreTesla on Monday compiled an average estimate for 1.6 million vehicle deliveries in 2025, down roughly 8% from 2024 and putting the company on track for its second straight drop in annual vehicle sales.Tesla has endured a rollercoaster ride this year. The company, whose stock recently notched an all-time closing high of $489.88, saw shares collapse in the first quarter amid stiff competition, particularly from Chinese EV manufacturers, and reputational fallout from Musk's incendiary political rhetoric. Shares of Tesla were seen little changed in premarket trade on Wednesday. The company's stock has gained more than 12.5% in 2025.— CNBC's Yun Li contributed to this report.",

    "body": "With just a few trading days left this year, 2025 looks to have been another hot year for stocks. The S&P 500 has returned more than 19% since Jan. 1 as of market close on Monday. Barring a year-end disaster, it will mark the third consecutive year of double-digit returns for investors in the broad U.S. stock market. Of course, past performance is no guarantee of future results, and financial pros generally caution against making wholesale changes to your strategy based on short-term stock market prognostications. But if you're invested in the broad stock market, many investment analysts believe that 2026 has the potential to be another great year for your portfolio. \"Certainly we're at a point where we've had incredibly strong performance from U.S. equity markets over the last three years. We don't think that that means that we can't have another good year next year,\" says Kristy Akullian, head of iShares investment strategy for the Americas at BlackRock. \"We are still pretty optimistic in terms of our outlook for U.S. equities. We're pretty upbeat, relatively bullish.\"Wall Street expects corporate earnings to continue to rapidly grow in 2026. On average, analysts expect companies in the S&P 500 to boost earnings by 15.5% next year, up from an estimated 13.2% in 2025 and 12.1% in 2024, according to data analytics firm LSEG. Additionally, the U.S. and global economy appear to be on healthy footing. Analysts at Goldman Sachs expect 2.6% U.S. gross domestic product growth in 2026 and a 2.8% growth in the global economy. That's slightly higher than consensus estimates, but generally, any positive momentum for the economy next year is probably a good sign for stocks, says Ryan Detrick, chief market strategist at The Carson Group. \"We simply don't see a recession next year,\" he says. \"And when you don't have a recession, the S&P 500 is up double-digits almost 70% of the time.\"Indeed, since 1950, the S&P 500 has posted calendar-year returns of 10% or more 68% of the time and a positive return 86% of the time, according to the Carson Group. Overall, Detrick expects the S&P 500 to record gains of 12% to 15% in 2026. What market projections mean for your portfolio in 2026A huge factor that market prognosticators are baking into their assumptions is continued spending on and adoption of artificial intelligence technology. \"The ongoing wave of AI-driven physical investment is expected to be a powerful force, reminiscent of past periods of major capital expansion such as the development of railroads in the mid-19th century and the late-1990s information and telecommunications surge,\" Vanguard analysts wrote in their 2026 outlook. When markets are expecting a serious paradigm shift, you always run the risk of a pullback should progress stall, says Jeffrey Buchbinder, chief equity strategist at LPL Financial. \"We would argue that AI disappointment is the No. 1 risk market in 2026,\" he says. \"That could take several forms. It could come from doubts that money will be there to pay for all this or concerns that it will not translate into data center construction that the market seems to be counting on.\"Buchbinder says he could see an AI-related pullback rankling markets in 2026. Even with that risk in mind, he and others believe that continued AI adoption — and the productivity it may bring — should drive the economy and stock market upward in the coming year. Based on LPL's 2026 \"fair value\" estimate for the S&P 500, analysts at the firm believe stocks could rise 5.7% to 7.2% from current levels next year. Analysts don't expect AI to do all of the heavy lifting in the stock market. Even non-AI stocks should benefit from more business-friendly tax laws and a Federal Reserve that's willing to continue slashing interest rates next year, says Akullian. \"I would characterize our U.S. equity outlook as AI optimism paired with sensible diversification,\" she says. Rather than trying to figure out where the winners will be or timing the market, you'd be wise to invest consistently, and across a variety of assets, Akullian says. And in a year where the global economy could be picking up steam, it may make sense to add some international exposure if your portfolio is heavily tilted toward U.S. stocks, she says. \"Nearly every investor that we speak to could probably benefit from adding some international allocations,\" she says. No matter how optimistic you are about the economy, you should always be prepared for some volatility,  says Detrick.He recommends talking with a financial advisor before making any moves in your portfolio. Even if you're managing your own investments, it's important to have a plan for the market's inevitable downturns.\"As we head into next year, just remember that markets go up and they go down. There are going to be bad days. There are going to be scary headlines,\" he says. \"At some point during this year, if stocks are down between 10% to 15%, that would be perfectly logical and normal. And if you're planning ahead of time for it, you probably won't make rash decisions with your investments.\"Want to give your kids the ultimate advantage? Sign up for CNBC's new online course, How to Raise Financially Smart Kids.

    "body": "An engineer debugs robots at the factory of AgiBot, a leading robotics company specializing in embodied intelligence, on December 8, 2025 in Shanghai, China. (Photo by Tang Yanjun/China News Service/VCG via Getty Images)Tang Yanjun | China News Service | China News Service | Getty ImagesBillionaire Elon Musk has put humanoid robots in the spotlight this year, positioning them as central to Tesla's valuation, which he thinks could hit tens of trillions of dollars. But Tesla is yet to sell its flagship humanoid robot Optimus.Instead, it's likely a slew of Chinese companies that will beat Tesla to the punch and begin ramping up production of robots in 2026, as Beijing puts the technology at the center of its strategic plans. \"China currently leads the United States in the early commercialization of humanoid robots,\" Andreas Brauchle, partner at consultancy Horváth, told CNBC by email. \"While both countries are expected to build similarly large markets over time, China is scaling more rapidly in this initial phase.\"Humanoid robots are designed to be shaped and move like a human. Artificial intelligence algorithms power their abilities along with complex hardware like semiconductors. Proponents say they could be used across various settings, from factories to hospitality and even in the home.Beijing makes robots a key priority Over the past few years, China has made robotics a key focus of its tech strategy, unveiling plans to create supply chains and mass production of the machines. Chinese President Xi Jinping and the country's top leaders, known as the Central Committee, met in October and released proposals for the \"15th five-year plan,\" a document that lays out some of the key focus areas for Beijing in the coming years. \"Embodied artificial intelligence,\" a term that refers to AI-driven hardware like robotics or driverless cars, was mentioned in the text.For China, humanoid robots represent an opportunity to address labor challenges in the world's second-largest economy as well as advancing Beijing's quest for tech supremacy.\"China's push into humanoid robotics development is driven by a combination of addressing demographic pressures, driving the next horizon of economic growth, and strengthening its role in global competition,\" Karel Eloot, senior partner at McKinsey & Company, told CNBC.watch nowChina's birth rates are declining and the population is aging, leading to a reduced number of people in the workforce and rising labor costs. Robots are seen as a way to address this. Meanwhile, China is locked in an ongoing tech race with the U.S. across multiple sectors. Robotics, seen as a real-world application of AI, could become a new battleground in 2026. Politico reported this month that Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick has been meeting with the CEOs of robotics companies to form a plan to accelerate the industry. Washington is considering issuing an executive order on robotics next year, Politico reported, citing people familiar with the matter.China's key robotics companies\"China could be the most important market for humanoids,\" RBC Capital Markets said in a note this month. Analysts at the bank forecast a global total addressable market for humanoids of $9 trillion by 2050, with China accounting for more than 60% of that. Chinese robotics firms are attempting to power ahead with mass production. Unitree, which is gearing up for an initial public offering that could value it at around $7 billion, is one of China's buzziest robotics players. The company has various robotics models, including humanoids. This year, it debuted its latest model, the H2, showcasing its ability to dance. Unitree robot performs for visitors at China Summit in pavilion 1 during Web Summit first day of this year's event on November 11, 2025 in Lisbon, Portugal.Horacio Villalobos | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesUBTech Robotics is another of China's key players. It makes humanoid robots for both an industrial setting, like a factory, as well as commercial applications, like being a tour guide. UBTech's flagship industrial model, the Walker S2, is able to swap out its battery itself in order to run 24 hours a day. The company is listed on the Hong Kong stock exchange and this month carried out a share placement to raise around $400 million to fund its expansion. UBTech plans to deliver 500 industrial robots this year and ramp up production of its humanoid robots to 5,000 in 2026 and 10,000 in 2027, the South China Morning Post reported in November.AgiBot is another player that said this month its 5,000th humanoid robot rolled off the production line.Xpeng displayed its humanoid robot called \"Iron\" at the IAA auto show in Munich, Germany on September 8, 2025.Arjun Kharpal | CNBCChina vs U.S. advantagesChina's manufacturing prowess and success in ramping up production in other products like electric vehicles, may give it an edge when it comes to robotics, analysts said.\"The depth of China's supply chain means companies can develop and manufacture robots at a significant cost advantage compared to other regions,\" Ethan Qi, associate director at Counterpoint Research, told CNBC.Indeed, UBTech expects production costs to drop 20% to 30% each year. Meanwhile, various local governments in China have subsidy programs aimed at companies in the robotics sector. The U.S. however, has \"advantages in AI, autonomy and advanced algorithmic development,\" Horváth's Brauchle said. watch nowAmerican firms are \"betting on vertical integration\" — which means owning and controlling more of the supply chain — according to McKinsey's Eloot. This includes components like actuators, which power a robot's movement, as well as the AI software that is integrated into the final product.\"The belief is that tighter ownership of the full system will deliver superior performance, stronger safety cases, and defensible intellectual property,\" Eloot said.China's humanoid robot market will initially be bigger than that of the U.S., but will not remain that way forever.\"Over the long term, both countries are expected to converge toward similarly large markets, whereby absolute mass-market penetration is expected after 2040, driven primarily by high-volume adoption in private households,\" Brauchle said.BottlenecksChina's robotics industry is not without its challenges. One bottleneck is its restricted access to certain chips required for robots. \"I think there's a very high reliance on U.S. chips, for example, Nvidia chips,\" Jacqueline Du, head of China industrial tech research at Goldman Sachs, told CNBC's \"The China Connection\" last month. Charlie Dai, principal analyst at Forrester, noted a number of other potential hurdles, such as AI limitations in unpredictable operating conditions for humanoids and regulatory barriers.\"Together, these challenges slow commercialization over the next two years and require coordinated innovation, security, and policy frameworks,\" Dai told CNBC.There are also the technological difficulties of replicating the human movement of limbs like hands and fingers — an incredibly complex task that demands capable of mimicking biological functions. \"Most robotic hands fall well short in effective degrees of freedom, sharply limiting their range,\" McKinsey's Eloot notes.Finally, perhaps the biggest challenge is bringing the cost of these complex machines down. Eloot said that product costs for today's advanced humanoid prototypes range from $150,000 to $500,000 per unit. Those need to come down to between $20,000 to $50,000 per unit to \"compete with human labor.\"Beijing's investment bubble concernsEven though robotics is a strategic priority for China, this hasn't stopped regulators from warning about a potentially overheated market.In November, China's top economic planning agency, the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), warned there is a risk of a bubble forming in the humanoid robotic market. The NDRC said that there are more than 150 humanoid robotics companies in China, with that number growing, and many of them are bringing out similar products.In the past, there have been boom and bust cycles around technology that Beijing has given strategic importance, such as electric vehicles.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconAn ETF that tracks Chinese robotics firms rose in 2025. \"Many assume that humanoid robots will soon exceed human-level versatility, speed and autonomy. Manufacturers reinforce this perception through polished demonstration videos and staged trade-show performances that present capabilities not yet reproducible in real industrial environments,\" Horváth's Brauchle said.\"This gap between perception and reality increases the risk of an investment bubble.\"\"A market correction could slow innovation and commercialization momentum,\" Forrester's Dai added.",

Russia's foreign minister, Sergey Lavrov, on Monday alleged that Ukraine had fired 91 drones at Putin's official residence in the Novgorod region, located between Moscow and St Petersburg.Lavrov said that the drones, allegedly launched between Sunday night and Monday morning, had been destroyed by air defenses and that no casualties had been reported. It's not clear where Putin was at the time of the alleged incident, and Lavrov provided no further details.

Russia's allegation came a day after Zelenskyy held in-person talks with Trump at Mar-a-Lago in Florida, with both leaders saying progress had been made on a 20-point peace plan and an agreement on security guarantees for Ukraine. Zelenskyy commented Monday that Moscow was trying to undermine peace talks between the U.S. and Kyiv, saying: \"Ukraine does not take steps that can undermine diplomacy. To the contrary, Russia always takes such steps. This is one of many differences between us.\"On Tuesday, the Kremlin said it had noted Zelenskyy's denial and said the Western media was \"playing along with Ukraine.\" Asked whether Russia would produce evidence for the alleged drone attack, Putin's press secretary, Dmitry Peskov, said that was a matter for the military.Ukraine's foreign minister, Andrii Sybiha, commented Tuesday on X that \"almost a day passed and Russia still hasn't provided any plausible evidence to its accusations of Ukraine's alleged 'attack on Putin's residence.'

Kremlin presidential aide Yuri Ushakov told the press that Trump was \"shocked by this information, literally outraged\" at \"such reckless actions,\" state media agency Tass reported. Ushakov added that it was stated that the incident would affect the U.S. approach to working with Zelenskyy.Trump was later directly asked for his reaction to the alleged drone attack and appeared to side with Russia's version of events.\"I learned about it from ‌President Putin today.

Contributor | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesSome commentators on social media said that Russia had aimed to use the alleged drone attack as a way to gauge Trump's attitude toward Ukraine, and to undermine — or stress test — potential security guarantees that Kyiv could receive as part of a peace deal.\"This is how supposedly ironclad 'security guarantees for Ukraine' would fall apart: one Russian false-flag operation — or just a lie ... and they're gone,\" Olena Halushka, co-founder of the International Centre for Ukrainian Victory, commented on X.When asked if there was any U.S. intelligence showing the attack actually took place, Trump admitted it's \"possible\" it didn't actually happen.

    "body": "On Dec. 8, Federal prosecutors in Texas unsealed documents that revealed an investigation into a massive smuggling network that stretched across the U.S. and the world. Dubbed \"Operation Gatekeeper\" by the feds, the investigation wasn't focused on drug smuggling or stolen goods but rather an alleged secret, underground network of suppliers for Nvidia's graphic processing units, or GPUs. Such chips are the backbone of the AI race, and can be used for military or civilian purposes. The government said a hidden smuggling ring was sending chips to China in defiance of American national security export control laws. The smuggling syndicate allegedly involved operatives illegally entering the United States, phony front companies and a secret warehouse shipping operation in New Jersey that was penetrated by at least one undercover agent working on behalf of the U.S. government. What that federal investigation found showcases the desperate struggle between the United States and China for access to cutting-edge chips that many believe will control the fate of the global economy. The smuggling ring, they said, attempted to export at least $160 million worth of Nvidia H100 and H200 GPUs to China between October 2024 and May 2025.The demand for these chips from China is enormous, and the best supply is still in the United States. Although China is establishing its own local AI chip market, the county remains highly dependent on Nvidia's technology. \"I think more than 60% of the leading AI models in China are currently using Nvidia's hardware,\" said Ray Wang, an analyst at SemiAnalysis. \"Nvidia have [a] systematic advantage ranging from hardware to software. And I think for now, if you combine [those] two factors together, it's still a thing that China is trying to catch up to.\" As they gathered facts, the government sent an undercover agent into a warehouse in Secaucus, New Jersey. There, the person allegedly witnessed suspects relabeling Nvidia GPUs with branding for a phony company they called \"Sandkayan.\" The shipping and export paperwork, the government said, misclassified the goods as \"adapters,\" \"adapter modules\" and \"contactor controllers.\" Operation Gatekeeper culminated in a dramatic scene at the New Jersey warehouse on May 28 as three trucks hired by the conspirators pulled in to pick up the smuggled chips.In near real time, a user in a text chain allegedly used by the conspirators messaged that one of the truck drivers transporting the goods to the New Jersey warehouse reported that police officers had appeared at the scene and were asking questions about the cargo's destination.According to the texts, conspirators told the drivers to \"just say they don't know anything.\"Five minutes later, according to prosecutors, one of the conspirators sent another message to the entire text thread: \"Dissolve this group chat. Delete everyone.\" Soon after that, prosecutors said federal agents swooped in and secured the high-tech equipment, preventing the goods on site from being shipped to China. The case comes amid a flurry of similar busts regarding unauthorized Nvidia exports in recent months. The think tank Center for a New American Security estimates that between 10,000 and several hundred thousand AI chips were smuggled to China in 2024 alone.\"In today's world, I feel there's so many ways that you can get your hand on Nvidia's chips in all kinds of illegal\" ways, Wang said. \"You can set up your data center globally, you can have shell companies to purchase Nvidia chips. And it's so hard to for Nvidia to track and do due diligence.\"A Nvidia spokesperson told CNBC that the U.S. government's export is rigorous and comprehensive.\"Even sales of older generation products on the secondary market are subject to strict scrutiny and review,\" the Nvidia spokesperson said. \"While millions of controlled GPUs are in service at businesses, homes, and schools, we will continue to work with the government and our customers to ensure that second-hand smuggling does not occur.\"But on the same day that federal prosecutors announced their investigation, President Donald Trump made a social media post that could undermine the whole operation. Trump said on Truth Social that the United States would now allow Nvidia’s H200 GPUs — the most powerful GPUs seized by authorities in Operation Gatekeeper — to be exported to China. Trump said those exports would be allowed provided that the the U.S. received a 25% cut of the sales. Trump added that Nvidia's most advanced AI chips, the Blackwell and Rubin GPUs, are still not authorized for export. Operation Gatekeeper resulted in the arrests of two businessmen and a guilty plea from a Houston man and his company for smuggling the cutting-edge AI technology. But the president's announcement has scrambled the case for U.S. prosectors trying to make the case that smuggling the same chips is a danger to the country's national security. Defense attorneys for the men charged were quick to pounce on the opportunity. In a court filing the next day, defense attorneys wrote that \"the President gave the lie to that claim when he announced that the United States will now allow Nvidia's H200 GPUs—the most powerful GPUs seized by authorities in this case—to be exported to China.\"Some experts said they believe smuggling of even Nvidia's highest end AI chips into China will continue. \"I don't believe the smuggling will just stop,\" Wang said. \"It is unclear to me that the new opening of the H200 chips will be enough for Chinese AI demand. The compute demand we are seeing globally has been accelerating, and I believe that should be the case in China as well.\"",

A reading above 50 indicates expansion.The composite PMI, a broader measure that tracks activity across manufacturing and services, climbed to 50.7 from 49.7 in November, pointing to broader improvement across the economy.China's non-manufacturing PMI, which covers services and construction, increased to 50.2 from 49.5 in November.Huo Lihui, chief statistician from China's National Bureau of Statistics, said that new orders rose in December, signaling a \"significant expansion\" in both production and demand in manufacturing.Private-sector data showed a similar trend. A separate PMI from independent research firm RatingDog showed manufacturing activity rising to 50.1 from 49.9, beating expectations of 49.8. Yao Yu, founder at RatingDog, said the reading indicated the manufacturing sector had returned to expansion. He noted that total new orders grew for a seventh consecutive month, supported by domestic new product launches and business development, leading to growth in production.However, Yao said that while firms remain confident for 2026, optimism has eased and remained below the historical average.Large enterprises drove the improvement, with their PMI rising to 50.8, up 1.5 percentage points from the previous month, data from China's National Bureau of Statistics showed.Activity among smaller firms remained weaker. The PMI for medium-sized enterprises rose to 49.8, while the index for small enterprises fell to 48.6, down 0.5 percentage points from November.Markets were mixed after the release. Hong Kong's Hang Seng index fell 0.83%, while the mainland's CSI 300 rose 0.33%. The data followed a decision by China's central bank earlier this week to keep loan prime rates unchanged, despite weak economic data and an extended slump in the property sector plaguing the world's second-largest economy.November's retail sales and industrial output missed expectations, while investment in fixed assets also contracted. Hao Zhou, chief economist at securities company Guotai Junan International, told CNBC's \"Squawk Box Asia\" Wednesday that the reading was a \"very good, positive surprise to the market.\"\"Maybe the market is concerned about China's property market, China stock market, as well as the consumption,\" Zhou said. \"The data for now suggests that the economy is on the right trend, and the momentum remains solid.\"",

    "body": "The logo of Chinese-owned semiconductor company Nexperia is displayed at the chipmaker's German facility, after the Dutch government seized control and auto industry bodies sounded the alarm over the possible impact on car production, in Hamburg, Germany, Oct. 23, 2025. Jonas Walzberg | ReutersChina has urged the Netherlands to swiftly correct its \"mistakes\" over chipmaker Nexperia and restore stability in the global semiconductor industry, in the latest development in a dispute over technology transfer.In September, the Dutch government invoked a Cold War-era law to effectively take control of Nexperia, a Chinese-owned chipmaker based in the Netherlands. The unusual move was reportedly made after the U.S. raised security concerns.In response, China moved to block its products from leaving China, which, in turn, raised the alarm among global automakers as they faced shortages of the chipmaker's components.On Wednesday, a spokesperson for China's Commerce Ministry said that the Netherlands should \"immediately correct its mistakes and clear the obstacles to restoring the stability and security of the global semiconductor supply chain.\"\"What is perplexing is that, faced with the anxiety and unease of the global industry, the Netherlands remains indifferent and stubbornly insists on its own way, showing absolutely no responsible attitude towards the security of the global semiconductor supply chain, and taking no substantive action whatsoever,\" the spokesperson said in a statement, according to a Google translation.A spokesperson for the Dutch government was not immediately available to comment when contacted by CNBC on Wednesday morning. Dutch Economy Minister Vincent Karremans has repeatedly defended his decision to intervene in the company over recent weeks. Read moreNexperia manufactures billions of so-called foundation chips — transistors, diodes and power management components — that are produced in Europe, assembled and tested in China, and then re-exported to customers in Europe and elsewhere. The low-tech, inexpensive chips are needed in almost every device that uses electricity. In cars, they're used to connect the battery to motors, for lights and sensors, for braking systems, airbag controllers, entertainment systems and electric windows.Auto industry groups have said that disruptions in the supply chain for Nexperia parts have not yet been fundamentally resolved, meaning that component availability remains uncertain.Japan's Nissan and German auto supplier Bosch are among the firms to have warned about looming shortages. Speaking to CNBC last month, a spokesperson for the German Association of the Automotive Industry (VDA), which represents Volkswagen, Mercedes-Benz Group and BMW among hundreds of others, warned of elevated risks to supply, \"particularly for the first quarter\" of 2026. — CNBC's Annika Kim Constantino contributed to this report.",

    "body": "watch nowThe big artificial intelligence bubble question has been the tech industry's buzziest debate all year, and one robot has weighed in with its opinion.KOID is a short, slender humanoid robot with a black metal body and a bright ring of light for a face. KOID is manufactured by Unitree, one of China's hottest tech companies, and the Nvidia-powered robot shares a name with an ETF launched in June by KraneShares that focuses on robotics companies.The walking, talking machine on Tuesday told CNBC that the AI bubble debate is certainly a \"hot topic,\" but KOID gave a neutral outlook on whether the boom is actually a looming bubble.\"We might see a lot of excitement around AI right now, but whether it's a bubble or just a transformative wave, is something only time will tell,\" KOID said.The AI-powered machine added that AI and humanoids are \"here to stay\" and will continue to evolve.Weighing in at about 77 pounds, KOID is one of Unitree's G1 models. Those humanoids have 23 degrees of freedom, or specific points where it can move independently, enabling it to achieve full-body maneuvers from dancing to boxing. KOID is available to purchase on RoboStore, the largest U.S. distributor of Unitree robots, with the models ranging from $8,990 to $128,900.A humanoid robot from RoboStore joins CNBC's \"Power Lunch\" on Dec. 30, 2025.CNBCRoboStore CEO Teddy Haggerty told CNBC's \"Power Lunch\" on Tuesday that while KOID can be programmed to do many kinds of tasks, the industry is still in a \"prototyping\" stage of figuring out where robots fit in everyday living.\"What is it that we really want robots to do?\" Haggerty said. \"Do we want robots to become our new housekeepers? Do we want them to help manufacturing? Do we want them to replace jobs?\"KOID, however, seems a little more certain of its own future. It said that robots will likely become \"even more versatile and integrated\" into daily life.\"They'll help out a variety of fields, from home assistants to industrial tasks, making life a bit easier and more efficient,\" the robot said.The humanoid robotics race has been heating up this past year, with companies including Boston Dynamics and Agility Robotics emerging in the space. Tesla's Optimus robots have taken center stage, with CEO Elon Musk saying that they are a future key contributor to the company's valuation.Yet while Optimus robots have yet to hit the market, Chinese companies have been ramping up production to beat the U.S. to the punch — with Unitree spearheading the pack.The company outperformed its peers in events like the World Robot Conference and World Humanoid Robot Games. Unitree, which is heading for an initial public offering that could value it at up to $7 billion, debuted its latest H2 model earlier this year.Read more CNBC tech newsElon Musk envisions humanoid robots everywhere.

    "body": "Charlie ErgenKarl Gehring | Dever Post | Getty ImagesWall Street grew increasingly obsessed with the artificial intelligence boom this year, pouring money into chips, data centers and applications. But investors looking beyond Silicon Valley found outsized returns in another location: Space. Some of the year's biggest market winners were defense companies that benefited from renewed interest in space exploration and military reindustrialization. President Donald Trump's military expansion plan includes a $175 billion Golden Dome project and efforts to bolster American shipbuilding.In looking to upgrade military tech and return astronauts to the moon for the first time in over 50 years, the government is leaning on more companies outside of traditional defense names such as Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman. Recently appointed NASA Administrator Jared Isaacman told CNBC last week that Trump's recommitment to exploring the moon is key to unlocking the \"orbital economy.\"The space and defense boon has opened a range of opportunities for high-profile private companies, including Palmer Luckey's Anduril and Elon Musk's SpaceX, which is aiming to go public next year. SpaceX is the parent of satellite internet provider Starlink.Among companies currently on the public market, investors have snapped up satellite names, from legacy providers such as EchoStar to newer players like Planet Labs. They're among a handful of satellite stocks have more than tripled in value this year. Planet LabsWill Marshall is the Co-Founder and CEO of Planet Labs Inc. with a model of the Dove satellite at their headquarters in downtown San Francisco, Calif., seen on Thursday September 8, 2016, where they create the shoe box size satellites that they send into space that gather photographs of earth.Michael Macor | Getty ImagesPlanet Labs, based in San Francisco, has seen its stock surge almost 400% this year due to booming demand for satellite imagery and space analytics. The company, which went public in 2021 through a special purpose acquisition company, is now valued at $6.2 billion.In its fiscal third-quarter earnings report this month, Planet Labs topped analyst estimates and lifted its guidance. During the period, Planet Labs more than tripled its backlog from a year ago. The company said that since the end of the quarter, it launched two of its Pelican satellites and 36 earth imaging SuperDove satellites. In 2025, Planet Labs inked new government and defense deals, including contracts with NATO and the European Space Agency. The company also renewed a partnership to provide Earth data to the U.S. Navy and won a $13.5 million task order for commercial satellite data with NASA.Planet Labs is working closely with Google on its Suncatcher project focused on machine learning in space. The company is aiming to launch two prototype satellites equipped with Google's custom AI chips called tensor processing units, or TPUs, by 2027. EchoStarwatch nowEchoStar, founded in 1980 by Charlie Ergen, creates networking, connectivity and satellite solutions under its Dish TV, Sling TV and Boost Mobile brands. Under pressure from regulators to build out a 5G network, the company was forced to sell wireless spectrum rights. In August, EchoStar struck a $23 billion deal to sell spectrum licenses to AT&T, and the following month sold $17 billion in spectrum rights to SpaceX to boost Starlink connectivity.Gwynne Shotwell, SpaceX's operating chief, said the deal would help the company \"end mobile dead zones\" globally and improve coverage for its customers. Cell tower companies Crown Castle and American Tower sued EchoStar following the spectrum deals, alleging the company is trying to exit its long-term agreements. On a call with analysts in November, EchoStar CEO Hamid Akhavan said the transactions would give the company the \"capital runway\" to expand its portfolio and business.\"The roadmap is not 100% laid out at the moment,\" he said. \"We'll try to take advantage of every opportunity in the best way.\"EchoStar shares have soared 377% this year, including a 49% rally since the start of December, sending the company's market capitalization past $31 billion. Earlier this month, the company got an upgrade from Morgan Stanley to buy from hold, with the firm citing value from the recent spectrum deals.  The biggest beneficiary of the stock pop has been the 72-year-old Ergen, who owns more than 143 million shares, mostly Class B, in the company. His net worth has jumped by $12.2 billion this year to $16.6 billion, according to Bloomberg.ViaSatViasat offices are shown at the company's headquarters in Carlsbad, California, on March 9, 2022.Mike Blake | ReutersViaSat shares have jumped 315% in 2025, as the company has expanded and scooped up more contracts.One of ViaSat's most significant achievements was the successful launch in November of its second of three ViaSAT-3 satellites, which will start servicing the Americas next year. The company has also landed major government deals, including a satellite contract with the U.S. Space Force, with a first launch planned for 2028.On the commercial side, ViaSat expanded partnerships with commercial airlines, including Etihad Airways, Aeromexico and Riyadh Air. The company competes directly with SpaceX's Starlink service, which is used by United Airlines, Air France and Qatar Airways.ViaSat drew attention this year from activist investor Carronade Capital and was upgraded to buy last month by JPMorgan Chase, which highlighted the potential breakup of its commercial and government businesses.Ondaswatch nowOndas, which makes autonomous drone technology, skyrocketed 251% this year.The Boston-Based company says on its website that it owns 21 patents and is addressing a potential $130 billion market. Revenue in the third quarter jumped more more than sixfold to $10.1 million, and the company upped revenue guidance for the year to $36 million from $25 million. CEO Erick Brock cited \"a powerful demand cycle for our unmanned platforms\" as a growth catalyst. Ondas inked major deals this year for its Optimus drone system, including a $14.3 million purchase order from a major defense contractor and a more than $3 million deal with the United Arab Emirates. The system allows governments, public safety entities and emergency services to autonomously collect data in tough environments. Backlog in the latest quarter rose to $22.2 million driven by demand for its Optimus and Iron Drone products. Stifel initiated coverage with a buy rating this month, calling Ondas a potential leader in the unmanned systems sector. AstronicsAerospace and defense systems maker Astronics climbed 241% this year. The company provides charging and lighting solutions used by major commercial aircraft makers and airlines such as Boeing and Delta. Its products also support the U.S. Army and NASA.At the end of the third-quarter, Astronics said its backlog totaled $646.7 million, with the aerospace segment accounting for $572.5 million. That represented a slight decline from a record backlog in the first quarter.In October, Astronics announced plans to buy Germany-based Bühler Motor Aviation. The deal is projected to add $22 million to revenue next year. A month prior, Astronics announced plans to sell $210 million in convertible notes.

    "body": "Bulgarian grape harvesters work in the vineyards of Chateau de Meursault in Meursault, in the Burgundy region of central-eastern France, on August 26, 2025. (Photo by ARNAUD FINISTRE / AFP) (Photo by ARNAUD FINISTRE/AFP via Getty Images)          Arnaud Finistre | Afp | Getty ImagesIt'll come as no surprise that sales of Champagne peak in the run-up to Christmas and New Year, with French fizz the drink of choice for many households in the festive season.Every year, around 120,000 seasonal workers come to work in France, harvesting grapes across 34,000 hectares of vines. The harvest only lasts a couple of weeks, making it a frenetic time for the sector.A darker side to the industry has emerged when it comes to that work, however, with recent reports shining a light on the exploitation and mistreatment of champagne grape pickers who are often foreign and undocumented migrants.During an extreme heatwave in the late summer of 2023, at least four migrant grape pickers, or \"vendangeurs\" as they're known, died in what has since been dubbed the \"harvest of shame.\"The case highlighted broader substandard working and housing conditions for pickers, including excessive working hours, low pay, a lack of safety equipment and protocols, such as adequate hydration and breaks.The scandal around working conditions and welfare comes at a difficult time for the wider industry — 2024's harvest saw lower yields than average due to spring frosts and a rainy period during the summer that only subsided toward the end of the growing season, just about \"saving\" the harvest. The 2025 harvest fared better and was lauded for its high-quality vintage, thanks to clement weather conditions.Nonetheless, this year's sales, which will be released in January, are likely to be further dented by U.S. import tariffs on goods from the EU, which caused Champagne shipments to the U.S. to slump.'Blatant mistreatment'The murkier side of the Champagne industry came to light when at least four migrant grape pickers died during the 2023 harvest, which took place during an extreme heatwave. Seasonal workers harvest grapes in vineyards in the AOC (Appellation d'origine contrôlée) Champagne region on September 14, 2023 in Châtillon-sur-Marne, France. Thierry Monasse | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesThen, in the summer of 2025, three individuals were put on trial, accused of human trafficking and exploiting over 50 West African migrant workers during the 2023 harvest.The victims reported being treated \"like slaves\" and \"animals\" and being housed in \"hellish\" and unsanitary conditions with no clean drinking water. Such conditions compromised workers' safety, health and dignity, the labor inspectorate said in the case. Unscrupulous hiring practices were also thrust into the spotlight during the trial as the defendants were affiliated with an employment agency which provided workers to the industry, highlighting Champagne houses' widespread use of subcontractors and employment agencies, or more informal channels, to recruit grape pickers. The defendants were convicted and handed fines and prison sentences, while trade unions said the use of \"middlemen\" and agencies had enabled Champagne houses to turn a blind eye to illegal working practices.In a summary of the case which was held in Châlons-en-Champagne criminal court, the prosecutor commented, \"we cannot accept that behind a bottle of Champagne lies uncontrolled subcontracting and blatant mistreatment.\"Sales challengesThe Comité Champagne — the overarching trade body for France's Champagne industry and representing over 16,000 winegrowers, 130 cooperatives and 370 Champagne houses — acknowledged that the court case had damaged the industry's reputation and said it would take a \"zero tolerance\" approach to any future abuses.\"We had to stand with the victims. You don't play games with the health and safety of seasonal workers. Nor do you play games with the image of our appellation,\" Comité co-presidents David Chatillon and Maxime Toubart told Le Monde newspaper in July after the trial. The Comité launched a \"Together for the Champagne Harvest\" action plan to ensure that worker health and safety protocols and worker accommodations were improved, as well as harvest regulations.  A French General Confederation of Labour (CGT) union member hands out pamphlets to seasonal grape pickers, often foreign workers, in a Champagne vineyard to inform them of their labour rights, in Igny-Comblizy, eastern France, on September 19, 2024. Francois Nascimbeni | Afp | Getty ImagesChampagne winegrowers and houses have been keen to show they are committed to workers' well-being. Moët & Chandon, the world's largest producer and part of LVMH, invested 1.5 million euros ($1.76 million) in new accommodation for an extra 90 grape pickers in 2024, bringing the total capacity of its accommodation provision to up to 1,900 beds. CNBC asked the Comité Champagne whether welfare measures had been fully implemented by its member organizations since they were proposed, but has not yet received a response. CNBC also contacted several unions, including the CGT labor union and SGV union of Champagne growers, about the reforms, but did not receive responses. watch nowIt's no doubt a difficult time for the wider industry — 2024's harvest saw lower yields than average due to spring frosts and a rainy period during the summer that only subsided toward the end of the growing season — just about \"saving\" the harvest. The 2025 harvest fared better and was lauded for its high-quality vintage, thanks to clement weather conditions.Synonymous with north-eastern France, Champagne accounts for 10% of the world's sparkling wine production by volume, but as much as 35% of sparkling wine's global market value.However, sales have declined in recent years amid a fall in global demand and declining alcohol consumption.In 2023, shipments of Champagne (which are typically a mix of several years' harvests) totalled 299 million bottles, down 8.2% compared to the previous year. In 2024, 271 million bottles were shipped, according to the Comité Champagne data. This year's sales face additional headwinds from U.S. import tariffs on goods from the EU.The industry has also faced challenges from within, with the CGT labor union at LVMH's Moët & Chandon and Veuve Clicquot's champagne units calling on workers to strike in December over the cancellation of year-end bonuses and demands for better pay. A spokesman for Moët & Chandon told CNBC that it would not comment on the dispute but that negotiations over pay would take place in early 2026, noting, \"we cannot comment before the negotiations.\" If sales keep falling, the treatment of seasonal pickers will be just one challenge facing the industry.",

    "body": "Silver bars are stacked in the safe deposit boxes room of the Pro Aurum gold house in Munich, Germany, January 10, 2025. Angelika Warmuth | ReutersBEIJING — China is set to tighten controls on silver exports from Thursday, expanding restrictions on the once-ordinary metal critical to the U.S. industry and defense supply chains.Tesla CEO Elon Musk criticized the move over the weekend on his social media platform X, responding to a post about the upcoming restrictions. \"This is not good. Silver is needed in many industrial processes,\" Musk wrote.But the rules are not new. China's Commerce Ministry first announced the new measures in October to strengthen oversight of rare metals, on the same day that U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping met in South Korea. At the time, Beijing agreed to a one-year pause on certain rare earth export controls, while the U.S. rolled back tariffs. Earlier this month, China released a list of 44 companies approved to export silver under the new measures in 2026 and 2027. The new rules in 2026 also restrict exports of tungsten and antimony, materials dominated by China's supply chain and widely used in defense and advanced technologies.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconWhile China hasn't explicitly announced a blanket ban on silver exports, the state-run Securities Times on Tuesday cited an unnamed industry insider, who said the new policy formally elevates the metal from an ordinary commodity to a strategic material, placing its export controls on the same regulatory footing as rare earths. The EU Chamber of Commerce in China found in a flash survey of members in November that a majority of respondents have been or expect to be affected by those Chinese export controls.The U.S. added silver to its nationally designated list of critical minerals in November, citing its use in electrical circuits, batteries, solar cells, and anti-bacterial medical instruments. A separate U.S. analysis said China was one of the world's largest producers of silver in 2024, and also home to one of the largest reserves.China exported more than 4,600 tons of silver in the first 11 months of the year, far more than the roughly 220 tons of imports during that time, according to Wind Information, citing official figures.watch nowThe restrictions on silver come just as interest in the metal has increased in recent weeks.Two Chinese companies contacted Canada-based Kuya Silver on Friday, offering to buy physical silver at about $8 more than the market price at the time, CEO David Stein confirmed to CNBC. He said one company was a manufacturer, and the other was a large trading firm. An Indian buyer approached Kuya on Monday with an offer $10 above the market price, he added.Conservative digital media outlet The Free Press ran a column Tuesday by George Mason University economics professor Tyler Cowen, who said the surge in silver and gold prices reflects investors shifting away from the U.S. dollar.He called the surge in prices \"a flashing warning for the [U.S.] economy.\"The U.S. dollar index has fallen by nearly 9.5% in 2025, its worst performance since 2017. In contrast, silver has more than doubled in price, on track for its best year since 1979 when the metal surged by nearly 470%. Silver prices retreated on Wednesday after touching a record peak above $80 an ounce at the start of the week, with spot prices last trading at around $73.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tWeekly analysis and insights from Asia's largest economy in your inbox\n\t\t\tSubscribe now\n\t\t\n\tGold has gained more than 60% so far this year and is also on pace for its best year since 1979.Bitcoin, sometimes promoted as an alternative to gold as a store of value, was trading near $88,000 Wednesday morning Beijing time, down by more than 5% for the year.— CNBC's Chris Hayes contributed to this report.",

    "body": "The logo of Meta is seen at the Viva Technology conference dedicated to innovation and startups at Porte de Versailles exhibition center in Paris, France, on June 11, 2025.Gonzalo Fuentes | ReutersMeta Platforms said Tuesday that it has acquired Manus, a Singapore-based developer of general-purpose AI agents, as the tech giant continues its massive investments into artificial intelligence. Manus, founded in China before relocating to Singapore, launched its first general AI agent earlier this year, which can execute complex tasks such as market research, coding, and data analysis. The company claimed it had achieved an annualized average revenue of more than $100 million just eight months after launch, while its revenue run rate exceeded $125 million.Meta said in a statement that its acquisition was aimed at accelerating AI innovation for businesses and integrating advanced automation into its consumer and enterprise products, including its Meta AI assistant.\"Manus is already serving the daily needs of millions of users and businesses worldwide ... We plan to scale this service to many more businesses,\" Meta said.The company also said it will take steps to wind down Manus AI's remaining business operations in China and that \"there will be no continuing Chinese ownership interests\" after the transaction.According to the firms, Manus will continue operating its subscription service without disruption. While further terms of the acquisition were not disclosed, the Wall Street Journal reported that the deal closed at an amount over $2 billion, according to sources familiar with the acquisition. The start-up was seeking a fresh round of fundraising at a $2 billion valuation when it was approached by Meta, the report added.Manus began as a product of Chinese start-up Butterfly Effect, also known as Monica.Im, before growing into a separate entity. It emerged as a notable AI player earlier this year after claiming its chatbot offered superior performance to OpenAI's Deep Research agent.The company raised $75 million in a Series B funding round led by U.S. venture firm Benchmark in April, and is backed by Tencent and private equity firm HongShan Capital Group (HSG), formerly known as Sequoia, according to data from market research firm Tracxn.The start-up reportedly laid off most of its staff in Beijing in July before moving its headquarters to Singapore in June as it looked towards global expansion.\"Joining Meta allows us to build on a stronger, more sustainable foundation without changing how Manus works or how decisions are made,\" Xiao Hong, CEO of Manus, said in a company release. The firm also announced a strategic partnership with Alibaba's Qwen AI team in March, highlighting its existing ties to Chinese tech companies.Aggressive AI expansionMeta's acquisition of Manus fits into its broader AI strategy of scooping up specialized AI start-ups to acquire talent and fast-track its broader AI business, including the development of its open-source Llama large language models.In June, for example, Meta invested $14.3 billion in AI start-up Scale AI, in a deal that brought its founder and CEO, Alexandr Wang, onto Meta's AI leadership team.Meanwhile, Meta acquired AI-wearables start-up Limitless earlier this month as the company looks to grow its AI device business.In the case of Manus, the firm's AI agent tools have drawn interest from major tech companies. In October, Microsoft began testing Manus in Windows 11 PCs, allowing users to create websites from local files. To date, Manus claimed to have processed more than 147 trillion \"tokens\" of text and data, and supported over 80 million virtual computers. It offers both free and paid subscription tiers.Meta said Manus employees will join its teams as the company continues to aggressively poach AI talent from start-ups and major rivals, including OpenAI and Google. ",

    "body": "watch nowMortgage rates are lower, home prices are easing and there is more supply on the market for sale. All of that adds up to improved affordability for today's homebuyers. Saving for a down payment, however, is still the biggest hurdle for first-time buyers. Prices nationally are basically flat compared with where they were a year ago, according to Parcl Labs, which runs daily studies of U.S. home prices. They dipped into negative territory earlier this month and are now just 0.3% higher year over year. The latest S&P Cotality Case-Shiller home price index, which reflects pricing from October, showed large disparities among metropolitan markets. Of the top 20 markets it highlights, Chicago; New York; and Cleveland had the biggest gains. Meanwhile eight cities showed prices in negative territory, with Tampa, Florida; Phoenix; and Dallas seeing the biggest losses. \"National home prices also continue to lag consumer inflation, as October's CPI is estimated around 3.1% (based on a provisional index the U.S. Treasury announced due to the federal data shutdown) – roughly 1.8 percentage points higher than the latest housing appreciation. In real terms, that gap implies a slight decline in inflation-adjusted home values over the past year,\" explained Nicholas Godec, head of fixed income tradables and commodities at S&P Dow Jones Indices, in a release.Mortgage rates, too, are coming down. The average on the 30-year fixed mortgage is currently at 6.19%, according to Mortgage News Daily. It started this year well over 7%. That decline means significant savings for homebuyers. For example, for a buyer putting down 20% on a $410,000 home (right around the national median), the monthly payment today is $200 less on average than it would have been a year ago. Weaker prices and lower rates are changing the math on what first-time buyers can afford.

That's down from the recent peak of 12 years in 2022, but still roughly double pre-pandemic levels, partly because the personal savings rate is so much lower than it was in 2020. Down payments continue to be the biggest hurdle to homeownership, which in the second half of this year fell to 65%, according to the U.S. Census, the lowest level since 2019.But an improved supply of homes for sale is adding momentum to the market. Active listings are now about 12% higher than they were a year ago, according to Realtor.com, but still 6% lower than they were just pre-pandemic.And buyers appear to be responding. Pending home sales, which count signed contracts on existing homes, rose more than expected in November. They were 3.3% higher than October, 2.6% higher than November 2024 and hit the highest level in nearly three years, according to the National Association of Realtors. \"Improving housing affordability–driven by lower mortgage rates and wage growth rising faster than home prices–is helping buyers test the market. More inventory choices compared to last year are also attracting more buyers to the market,\" said Lawrence Yun, chief economist for the Realtors, in a release. ",

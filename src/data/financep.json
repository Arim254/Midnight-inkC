    "body": "A few weeks ago, I tweaked my back putting weights on the rack at the gym. When things didn't get any better after a week of rest, ice and ibuprofen, I decided to go to the orthopedist. After sharing my medical history and the details of my injury with the nurse, I sat in the exam room goofing around on my phone waiting for the doctor. The next knock at the door wasn't a physician, however, but a technician. \"Come across the hall for an X-ray,\" she said.  \"Oh good,\" I should have thought. \"They can get to the bottom of what's wrong.\"Instead, I felt a pang of dread. Earlier this year I was trying to sort out a skin condition and went to see an allergist. They told me they'd run the standard test where they prick you with 50 or so different allergens and see which ones you react to. It went well enough — it turns out I'm not allergic to much of anything. A few months later, the bill for the test came in the mail. It was close to $500. Because I hadn't hit my annual deductible yet, I was on the hook for the whole thing. I was pretty shook. Not once had any of the doctors I'd seen discussed that this procedure might be costly for me. They just ran the tests and scheduled me for a follow-up. So when I returned to the orthopedist's exam room having gotten my X-ray, still having not hit my deductible, all I could think was, \"What did that just cost me?\" In hindsight, I shouldn't have just quietly followed her. But refusing to go with the X-ray technician until she quoted me a price felt rude. Plus, how would she even know the cost? What you pay for any given procedure depends on your insurance coverage as well as rates your insurer has negotiated with the health-care provider's billing office.I'm not the only one recovering from health-care sticker shock. A 2024 study from private health-care foundation the Commonwealth Fund found that 45% of insured, working-age adults had received an unexpected bill in the previous year. Your first step to avoid unexpected bills is to talk with your health-care provider. That may mean speaking up during a medical consultation, or having more involved conversations with your insurance company and your doctor's billing department, says Carolyn McClanahan, a medical doctor, certified financial planner and founder of financial planning firm Life Planning Partners. That can feel intimidating, especially if you're on the spot, says McClanahan. You want to speak up for yourself and avoid surprise bills, but, if you're like me, you don't want to ruffle any feathers when you need care. How to avoid surprise medical billsI still haven't gotten the bill for my X-ray. But the discomfort I felt bringing up cost with the technician is a common phenomenon, says McClanahan. Nevertheless, it's worth it to speak up and advocate for yourself both before and after your treatment, she says. Talking with your provider beforehand can help you understand the costs of procedures and put you on a path toward treatment you can afford. And even if you need high-priced treatment, doing some research and putting in legwork around costs can help you avoid sticker shock down the line. Here are three steps McClanahan recommends to avoid surprise bills. Step 1: Communicate with your doctorIf you, like me, are put on the spot with a procedure of indeterminate cost, the first thing to do is ask your provider whether it's really necessary, says McClanahan. You may find that there's wiggle room on timing or cheaper alternatives to procedures or drugs the doctor recommends. McClanahan suggests a possible script: \"I have this really, really high deductible, and I'm trying to manage my bills. Can you please let me know what it's going to cost or verify that I really need this now?\"Discussing your concerns with your doctor up front may help you get a treatment plan that's more in line with your budget, she says. Step 2: Do the best you can to shop aroundEven if you have concerns about price, you may absolutely need a certain procedure. And if you haven't yet hit your deductible in a given year, you're likely going to have to pay up. If you need to schedule a treatment at a later date, you can potentially save yourself some money by comparing costs at different providers, says McClanahan. That means calling around to different medical providers in your area and asking their billing department what they charge for the treatment you want. Getting answers won't always be straightforward, however, McClanahan says.\"The challenge is that every insurance company negotiates different rates,\" she says. \"The person sitting at the billing desk isn't going to know off the top of their head what that rate is going to be.\"What's more, what starts out as one treatment, like a colonoscopy, can turn into a pricier procedure if your surgeon discovers something concerning and has to perform biopsies, McClanahan says. In other words, it may not be easy to pin down your medical provider's billing department on an exact price. But do your best to explain to them that budget is an important factor when it comes to whether or not you'll be able to receive treatment at their facility, McClanahan says. Step 3: Investigate your billI still haven't gotten the bill for my visit to the orthopedist. But when I do, I'd be smart to ask for an itemized list of charges, McClanahan says. \"You need to see what they've actually charged you for,\" she says. \"Then go on the internet and compare it with what's actually a reasonable charge.\"McClanahan likes the search tool at FAIR Health, which shows estimated in-network and out-of-network costs for treatment based on what providers charge in your area.If a bill you received is much higher than the average cost, or if your doctor's office has tacked on charges that don't seem to be in line with the care you received, call the billing department and plead your case, McClanahan says. In the case of my allergy test, a medical provider would be unlikely to negotiate with me, McClanahan says. The price tag was in line with what providers in my area charge, and I was billed correctly. In more extreme cases — say, ones in which a patient with a high deductible is facing down thousands of dollars in bills — medical providers may be willing to come down on costs, McClanahan previously told CNBC Make It.Earn more and get ahead with CNBC's online courses.

    "body": "I spend my days focused on the organ that defines us: the human brain. As a neurologist, I diagnose everything from chronic headaches to complex neurodegenerative diseases. But some of the most important work I do to protect the brain happens in my family's kitchen as my wife and I raise our kids.Infancy through early childhood is a critical window of neuroplasticity and growth, and what we feed our children can directly impact their brain health in the long run.The best foods for the brain are universal: fruits, vegetables, and high-fiber options. My philosophy isn't restrictive, and my kids eat the same varied diet as most of their friends. Still, I was firm on three key rules, especially during infancy.1. No honey before they're 12 months oldHoney can be deadly to an infant, if rarely. This is because honey contains spores of the Clostridium botulinum bacteria, even in small amounts and in cooked items. Infants' gastrointestinal tracts aren't mature or diverse enough to outcompete these spores, allowing them to germinate and grow into active bacteria that produce botulinum neurotoxin. This can cause infant botulism, a rare but extremely serious form of food poisoning.The toxin attacks the nervous system, leading to muscle weakness. Babies can present with a weak cry, poor sucking reflex, and decreased muscle tone. In severe cases, it can cause paralysis of the breathing muscles and can lead to respiratory failure and even death. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the American Academy of Pediatrics stress that infants \"should not be given any foods containing raw or cooked honey.\"2. Expose them early to common allergensFor years, parents in many parts of the world were advised to delay exposing their kids to common allergens like peanuts and eggs. We now know that this advice was wrong. Delaying introduction can actually increase their risk of developing a severe food allergy.Guidance to parents evolved after a landmark study showed that introducing peanuts early and maintaining their consumption significantly reduced the risk of peanut allergy in high-risk infants by up to 86%. Additional research has supported the early introduction of other common allergens, such as cooked egg, and showed this helped protect against allergy development.DON'T MISS: Exclusive Black Friday discounts on courses to help you earn more money and get ahead at workChanges in behavior or mood, such as irritability or hyperactivity, are sometimes observed in children with food allergies. These effects may be due to discomfort and pain from systemic immune responses rather than direct neurological injury, but they can influence neurological and behavioral outcomes.Once my children were ready for solids — that's usually around four to six months, depending on their risk factors — my wife and I introduced age-appropriate forms of highly allergenic foods like peanuts and cooked egg. We kept them in regular rotation after that to build a healthy immune system and brain.3. No sweetened drinks in infancyI avoid all forms of liquid calories and non-nutritive sweeteners — which add flavor but little to no nutritional value — in my kids under the age of 1. This means no juice, no sugar-sweetened beverages (like soda, fruit drinks, and sweetened waters), and no artificially sweetened beverages (like diet soda). Excess sugar can cause metabolic stress and can trigger reward pathways similar to addictive substances. And it has been linked to impaired learning and memory. Even small amounts of sugary drinks in infancy are also associated with increased risk of obesity later in childhood. Moreover, early exposure to sweet flavors can reinforce lifelong preferences for sweet foods, potentially influencing emotional regulation and behavior for years to come.Fruit juices may seem healthy, but they're a poor substitute for actual fruit. No matter how natural or organic they are, they strip away beneficial fiber that slows sugar absorption. They provide kids with too many calories, don't leave them feeling full, and can displace nutrient-rich foods, all of which can contribute to poor diet patterns.Artificial sweeteners lack long-term safety data in children, especially infants. Though more research is needed, there are concerns that they may alter gut microbiota, disrupt blood sugar regulation, and affect sweet taste perception. Artificially sweetened beverages may also make children feel full and skip nutrient-rich foods.Before my kids turned 1, breast milk was their primary source of nutrition. We introduced water in small amounts with complementary foods after about six months. And since then, they've been drinking mostly water and milk. But while we keep sweetened drinks to a minimum, my wife and I believe it's more important to teach our kids how to make good choices than to enforce strict restrictions as they get older.As always, you should consult with a health care professional about your kids' diet. Baibing Chen is a double-boarded certified neurologist and epileptologist practicing at Henry Ford Health.

Tom Williams | Cq-roll Call, Inc. | Getty ImagesThe Pentagon on Monday said that it was reviewing what it called \"serious allegations of misconduct\" against Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona for making a video with five other Democratic lawmakers that urged members of the military to refuse to follow illegal orders.The Pentagon said Kelly, who is a retired U.S. Navy captain, might be recalled to active military duty and face a possible court-martial on the allegations.President Donald Trump last week called Kelly and the other Democrats \"traitors,\" and said their statements on the video were \"seditious behavior at the highest level.\"Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, in a statement on X on Monday, said, \"The video made by the 'Seditious Six' was despicable, reckless, and false.\"\"Encouraging our warriors to ignore the orders of their Commanders undermines every aspect of 'good order and discipline,'\" said Hegseth.\"Five of the six individuals in that video do not fall under @DeptofWar jurisdiction,\" Hegseth wrote. \"However, Mark Kelly (retired Navy Commander) is still subject to UCMJ — and he knows that.\" UCMJ is the Uniform Code of Military Justice.The Pentagon, in its own social media statement, said that a \"thorough review of these allegations has been initiated to determine further actions, which may include recall to active duty for court-martial proceedings or administrative measures.\"\"This matter will be handled in compliance with military law, ensuring due process and impartiality,\" the Pentagon said.Kelly, in a response on X, said, \"Secretary Hegseth's tweet is the first I heard of this. I also saw the President's posts saying I should be arrested, hanged, and put to death.\"\"If this is meant to intimidate me and other members of Congress from doing our jobs and holding this administration accountable, it won't work,\" Kelly wrote.\"I've given too much to this country to be silenced by bullies who care more about their own power than protecting the Constitution.\"Read more CNBC politics coverageJudge dismisses James Comey and Letitia James cases over 'unlawful' prosecutor appointmentSen.

His new publication, titled \"Cassandra Unchained\" with a $379 annual subscription fee, arrives with a familiar warning: He believes markets are once again deep in bubble territory.In announcing the launch, Burry referenced the parallels between the late 1990s tech mania and today's rush into AI and how the bubbles have been ignored by policymakers, in his view.\"Feb 21, 2000: SF Chronicle says I'm short Amazon.

I'm back. Please join me,\" Burry wrote in a post Sunday night on X.He highlighted then-Fed Chair Alan Greenspan's 2005 insistence that U.S. housing prices showed no signs of a bubble, just two years before the subprime implosion validated Burry's famous \"Big Short.\" And now he contends history is rhyming again.Like the dot-com era, investors are extrapolating exponential growth, dismissing profitability concerns and funding massive capital expenditures on the assumption that the technology will rewrite the economy, he believes.The investor noted Powell has waved off bubble fears, saying AI companies are \"actually profitable\" and \"a different thing\" from past booms.\"This is different in the sense that these companies, the companies that are so highly valued, actually have earnings and stuff like that,\" Powell said during a news conference in October.Burry took it as an eerie echo of the assurances offered by Greenspan two decades ago. At the height of the dot-com boom, Burry was publicly short Amazon. Today, he has been openly bearish on the poster children of the AI boom, Nvidia and Palantir.",

The guides include top products, key differences between the products and the latest information from retailers, according to a blog. Users will be able to tailor their guides based on their budget, what features they care about and who they are shopping for. OpenAI said it will take a couple of minutes to generate answers with shopping research, so users who are looking for simple answers like a price check can still rely on a regular ChatGPT response.When users submit prompts to ChatGPT that say things like, \"Find the quietest cordless stick vacuum for a small apartment,\" or \"I need a gift for my four year old niece who loves art,\" they will see the shopping research tool pop up automatically, OpenAI said. The tool can also be accessed from the menu. OpenAI has been pushing deeper into e-commerce in recent months. The company introduced a feature called Instant Checkout in September that allows users to make purchases directly from eligible merchants through ChatGPT. Shopping research users will be able to make purchases with Instant Checkout in the future, OpenAI said on Monday. OpenAI said its shopping research results are organic and based on publicly available retail websites, and that it will not share users' chats with retailers. It's possible that shopping research will make mistakes around product availability and pricing, the company said.Shopping research is rolling out to OpenAI's Free, Go, Plus and Pro users who are logged in to ChatGPT.WATCH: OpenAI taps Foxconn to build AI hardware in the U.S.watch now",

Leah Millis | ReutersPresident Donald Trump has appointed two Department of Commerce officials to oversee U.S. Steel under the golden share agreement reached with Japan's Nippon, according to a letter posted Monday in the Federal Register. Trump approved U.S. Steel's controversial acquisition by Nippon in June after securing veto rights over key business decisions under a golden share arrangement. U.S. Steel stopped trading on the New York Stock Exchange that same month after the acquisition was completed. Trump holds the veto powers covered by the golden share as U.S. president, but he can also designate someone else to wield those authorities as his representative if he wants. The president appointed William Kimmitt, Under Secretary of Commerce for International Trade, as his designee in a letter to U.S. Steel.\"I, President Donald J. Trump, hold the Class G Preferred Stock (Golden Share) in U.S. Steel, pursuant to the National Security Agreement (Agreement) between the United States Government, Nippon Steel Corporation, and U.S. Steel,\" Trump said in a Nov. 20 letter to U.S. Steel executive Scot Duncan.\"The Golden Share provides the President with the ability to oversee U.S. Steel's activities and to ensure the company continues operating its United States-based production facilities,\" Trump said. The golden share allows Trump or his designee to veto decisions that include changing U.S. Steel's name, moving its headquarters from Pittsburgh, relocating the company outside the U.S., or closing production facilities.  Trump also appointed David Shapiro, a chief counsel at Commerce, as a director on U.S. Steel's board representing the U.S. government, according to the letter. The golden share goes to future U.S. presidents or their designee after Trump leaves office. ",

    "body": "Ariana Grande and Cynthia Erivo star in Universal's \"Wicked: For Good.\"UniversalUniversal's \"Wicked: For Good\" defied gravity at the box office, snaring an estimated $150 million from domestic ticket sales.It marks the second-highest opening weekend for a film released in 2025, just behind Warner Bros.' \"A Minecraft Movie,\" which tallied $163 million back in April. It also outpaces the debut of last year's \"Wicked,\" which tallied $112.5 million in the U.S. and Canada.The film's haul sets the record for the biggest opening weekend of a Broadway adaptation. With additional ticket sales from international markets, \"Wicked: For Good\" is set to reach a $226 million global haul for its first three days in theaters.An estimated 10 million tickets were sold for \"Wicked: For Good\" during opening weekend, topping the 8 million sold during the opening of \"Wicked\" last year, according to data from EntTelligence. The box office data company also reported that 30% of domestic screenings were in premium large format theaters, up from 18% for \"Wicked.\" These tickets are more expensive than general admission and can help bolster blockbuster releases. EntTelligence noted that general tickets for \"Wicked: For Good\" averaged at around $15.25 each while tickets for premium screens averaged at $18.75 a piece.\"Team Universal did a fantastic job of following perfectly on the success of the original film a year ago and have parlayed that into an even bigger debut for this second installment,\" said Paul Dergarabedian, head of marketplace trends at Comscore. \"'Wicked: For Good' will look forward to incredibly strong playability throughout Thanksgiving week and beyond during the all-important holiday movie-going season.\"Last year, the combination of \"Wicked,\" Paramount's \"Gladiator II\" and Disney's \"Moana 2\" helped boost the Thanksgiving holiday box office to its highest haul ever. This year, \"Wicked: For Good\" is joined by Disney's \"Zootopia 2.\"The first \"Zootopia\" opened in 2016 to $75 million domestically but went on to gross more than $1 billion worldwide. Pent-up audience demand could push the film's three-day opening to around $100 million and the five-day Thanksgiving period to north of $125 million. \"The impressive expected over-performance by 'Wicked: For Good,' in combination with the other films in the marketplace, could give last year's record Thanksgiving literally a run for its money,\" Dergarabedian said. \"This is great news after all the negative stories about the challenging October box office drove the narrative.\" Disclosure: Comcast is the parent company of NBCUniversal, which owns CNBC. Versant would become the new parent company of CNBC upon Comcast's planned spinoff of Versant.",

    "body": "watch nowTesla sales in China dropped to a three-year low in October, raising concerns the electric vehicle maker could see its first full-year sales decline in the country this year. Fierce competition from local rivals such as NIO and Li Auto — both reporting this week — and a bruising price war in the face of a down economy pushed Tesla's China sales to 26,006 last month. The U.S. automaker's share in the Chinese EV market shrank to 3.2% in October from 8.7% in September. \"Tesla is getting surrounded by a swarm of Chinese automakers — from above, below, left and right,\" Michael Dunne, CEO of Dunne Insights and auto analyst, told CNBC. \"Like a swarm of drones, each is taking some sales from the company with a target on its back.\"Tesla's newest direct competitor in the upper echelon of the Chinese EV market is Xiaomi. The smartphone maker's YU7 sports utility vehicle and SU7 sedan posted record sales in October despite accidents that raised concerns about the cars' safety.The auto newbie sold nearly 109,000 cars in the third quarter — compared with 170,000 for Tesla. Xiaomi's EV unit turned a profit for the first time.Late bloomer Leapmotor is pressuring Tesla, too. The Chinese EV startup was founded in 2015, but only this year started beating out its local peers in terms of sales and stock price. Analysts credit its in-house production for keeping costs down. Its C10 mid-sized SUV is priced at roughly half of a Model Y. Leapmotor also has a JV partnership with Europe's Stellantis.Leading EV sales in China this year is the Geely Geome Xingyuan. The hatchback is not a direct competitor to Tesla since it serves the cheaper end of the market with its sub $10,000 price tag. Yet it is an indication of where Chinese buyers are at — budget-conscious but looking for value.The Geome Xingyuan's success also highlights another trend — traditional automakers such as Geely making inroads in EVs. That trend is turning Huawei into a more notable Tesla rival. The Chinese tech giant partners with old-line carmakers like Seres, Chery, and Beijing Auto. The Aito M8, a Seres model, has become popular among high-end SUVs.Despite the steep competition, Tesla's Model Y is still holding up, ranking 6th in the overall market. At Tesla's annual general meeting this month, Musk said he expected the Chinese to approve the company's \"Full-Self Driving\" software in early 2026.Yet analysts say Tesla needs to refresh its models to keep pace with its local rivals.Tu Le, founder of consultancy firm Sino Auto Insights, sees 2026 as a \"pivotal year\" for Tesla in China.\"Reality is catching up to Tesla in China,\" Tu said. \"Tesla has done an admirable job via price cuts, non-price-cut price cuts and other tricks to maintain sales of almost five and four-year-old cars versus some of the world's most advanced EVs. But not keeping up with the Xiaomi's, BYD's and XPeng's seems to be finally starting to show itself in its monthly sales.\"Last month, Tesla reported its total third-quarter revenue increased 12% from a year earlier to $28.10 billion, following two straight periods of declines. Even with the overall revenue growth, Tesla's third quarter was marked by a continuing sales slump in Europe, driven partly by competition from EV makers like Volkswagen and BYD.",

    "body": "NY Attorney General Letitia and Former FBI Director James Comey.Michael M. Santiago | Cheriss May | Nurphoto | Getty ImagesA federal judge on Monday dismissed criminal cases against former FBI Director James Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James, ruling that Lindsey Halligan, the interim U.S. attorney who brought both indictments, was invalidly appointed.Halligan, President Donald Trump's former personal lawyer, had been installed as prosecutor in violation of the Appointments Clause of the Constitution, senior U.S. District Judge Cameron Currie ruled in both cases in U.S. District Court in Eastern Virginia.\"I conclude that all actions flowing from Ms. Halligan's defective appointment, including securing and signing Ms. James's indictment, constitute unlawful exercises of executive power and must be set aside,\" Currie ruled. An identical line appears in a separate order scrapping Comey's case. The cases were both dismissed \"without prejudice,\" potentially allowing charges to be filed again at a later date.The rulings are a major blow to Trump, who had openly pushed Attorney General Pam Bondi to take legal action against Comey, James and other perceived political foes.\"The facts of the indictments against Comey and James have not changed and this will not be the final word on this matter,\" White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson told CNBC in a statement.Halligan is the fourth U.S. attorney of the second Trump administration to have been deemed wrongfully appointed by a judge.Halligan's office and the Department of Justice did not immediately respond to CNBC's requests for comment on Currie's rulings.\"I am heartened by today's victory and grateful for the prayers and support I have received from around the country,\" James said in a statement following the dismissal. \"I remain fearless in the face of these baseless charges as I continue fighting for New Yorkers every single day.\"Comey was charged in late September on counts of making a false statement and obstruction stemming from his testimony to Congress years earlier. The indictment against Comey, a longtime target of Trump's ire, came days before a five-year statute of limitations was set to expire.It also came less than a week after Bondi, at Trump's behest, had appointed Halligan as interim U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia.The prior U.S. attorney in that role, Erik Siebert, had resigned after reportedly expressing concern about pursuing charges against Comey — and after Trump said publicly that he wanted Siebert out.James was charged in mid-October with bank fraud and making false statements to a financial institution in connection with a mortgage she obtained to buy a home in 2020.In addition to the constitutional violation, Currie determined that Halligan's installation ran afoul of a statutory mechanism for appointing interim U.S. attorneys. The law, which gives the attorney general 120 days to make interim appointments, had been triggered by the appointment of Siebert on Jan. 21, the judge wrote.When that clock ran out on May 21, \"so too did the Attorney General's appointment authority,\" Currie ruled.Halligan has therefore \"been unlawfully serving in that role\" since her appointment on Sept. 22, Currie wrote.The judge noted that in both cases, Halligan was the only prosecutor who presented information to the grand juries that ultimately returned the indictments.James' attorney, Abbe Lowell, said he would challenge \"any further politically motivated charges\" from the Trump administration.\"The President went to extreme measures to substitute one of his allies to bring these baseless charges after career prosecutors refused,\" Lowell said in a statement. \"This case was not about justice or the law; it was about targeting Attorney General James for what she stood for and who she challenged.\"This is breaking news.

Joe Skipper | ReutersAmazon said Monday it will begin allowing businesses to test its recently rebranded internet-from-space service that seeks to compete with SpaceX's Starlink.Select businesses will be able to test Amazon Leo production hardware and software as part of an \"enterprise preview\" of the service \"ahead of a wider rollout,\" the company said in a blog post. The test program will allow Amazon to collect feedback and \"tailor solutions for specific industries\" ahead of a broader launch, the company said. Earlier this month, Amazon renamed its satellite internet offering from Project Kuiper to Amazon Leo and rolled out a new website to market the service. The name is a nod to low Earth orbit, a region of space that's within 1,200 miles of Earth's surface and where Amazon's satellite constellation will be concentrated. Six years ago, Amazon unveiled its plans to build a constellation of 3,236 low Earth satellites, designed to provide high-speed, low-latency internet to consumers, corporations and governments, offering connections through square-shaped terminals. The company has sent up more than 150 satellites since April through a series of rocket launches handled by partners, such as United Launch Alliance and Elon Musk's SpaceX. It's aiming to compete with Starlink, owned by SpaceX, which currently dominates the market and has nearly 9,000 satellites in orbit.Amazon has inked deals with JetBlue, L3Harris and Australia's NBN internet network, among others. Amazon said it's shipping units of its \"Pro\" terminals, as well as its \"Ultra\" antennas, to members of its enterprise preview program. The company on Monday showed off the final production design of its Ultra model, which will offer download speeds of up to 1 gigabit per second and upload speeds up to 400 megabits per second powered by an in-house custom silicon chip, \"making it the fastest commercial phased array antenna in production.\"Amazon said it expects to expand the program to more customers as it adds coverage and capacity to the Leo network.  The company has yet to disclose pricing and availability for consumers.

But Dutch regulators are telling Tesla fans to stop pressuring safety authority RDW on the matter, and that their efforts will have \"no influence\" on the ultimate decision. The RDW issued a statement on Monday directed at those who have been sending messages to try and get the  agency to clear Tesla's premium partially automated driving system, marketed in the U.S. as the Full Self-Driving (Supervised) option. It's not yet available for use in the Netherlands or Europe broadly. \"We thank everyone who has already done so and would like to ask everyone not to contact us about this,\" the agency said. \"It takes up unnecessary time for our customer service. Moreover, this will have no influence on whether or not the planning is met. Road safety is the RDW's top priority: admission is only possible once the safety of the system has been convincingly demonstrated.\"The regulator said it will make a decision only after Elon Musk's company shows that the technology meets the country's stringent vehicle safety standards. The RDW has booked a schedule allowing Tesla to demonstrate its systems, and said it could decide on authorization as early as February. Last week, Tesla posted on X encouraging its followers to contact RDW to express their wishes to have the systems approved. The post claimed, \"RDW has committed to granting Netherlands National approval in February 2026,\" adding a message to \"please contact them via link below to express your excitement & thank them for making this happen as soon as possible.\" Tesla said other EU countries could then follow suit. The RDW corrected Tesla on Monday, saying in a statement on its official website, that such approval is not guaranteed and had not been promised. Tesla didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.In the U.S., the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration opened an investigation into Tesla's FSD-equipped vehicles in October following reports of widespread traffic violations tied to use of the systems.The cars Tesla sells today, even with FSD Supervised engaged, require a human driver ready to brake or steer at any time.For years, Musk has promised that Tesla customers would soon be able to turn their existing electric vehicles into robotaxis, capable of generating income for owners while they sleep or go on vacation, with a simple software update.That hasn't happened yet, and Tesla has since informed owners that future upgrades will require new hardware as well as software releases.Tesla is testing a Robotaxi-brand ride-hailing service in Texas and elsewhere, but it includes human safety drivers or supervisors on board who either conduct the drives or manually intervene as needed. Musk has said the company aims to remove human driers in Austin, Texas, by the end of 2025. WATCH: Tesla bear on company's EV businesswatch now",

Evelyn Hockstein | ReutersPresident Donald Trump spoke on the phone with Chinese President Xi Jinping on Monday morning, a White House official confirmed to CNBC.Specifics about the call, including why it was scheduled or who requested it, were not immediately clear. The White House did not provide details about what was discussed, but Trump on Monday later confirmed the call in a post on Truth Social.\"We discussed many topics including Ukraine/Russia, Fentanyl, Soybeans and other Farm Products, etc. We have done a good, and very important, deal for our Great Farmers — and it will only get better,\" Trump wrote. \"Our relationship with China is extremely strong!\"He also noted that the two leaders had agreed to reciprocal in-person meetings.

    "body": "U.S. President Donald Trump delivers remarks at the McDonald's Impact Summit at the Westin Hotel in Washington, D.C., U.S., Nov. 17, 2025. Evelyn Hockstein | ReutersPresident Donald Trump on Monday said that California Gov. Gavin Newsom is \"laying siege on the minimum wage.\" Trump's comments at the McDonald's Impact Summit likely referred to California's higher hourly pay floor for fast-food workers, which took effect a year and a half ago. However, data so far indicate the policy hasn't been the danger Trump described. Research shows that the state's fast-food worker turnover is down. Widespread closures haven't occurred, and restaurant chains are still opening locations in California. To be sure, the increased wages have put more pressure on restaurant chains and operators at a time when other costs are climbing and diners are eating out less frequently. Plus, consumers are paying more for their burgers, chicken tenders and fries as a result of the new pay floor. But after a protracted fight over whether higher pay for workers would harm restaurants, critics' worst fears have not come to pass.Fast-food workers in California at chains with more than 60 national locations started earning $20 an hour in April 2024, 25% more than the state's broader minimum wage of $16 an hour. The sectoral pay floor is part of larger law passed in California that also establishes a council that will recommend proposed industry standards to state agencies and carries the authority to raise the hourly minimum wage annually. Fast-food workers' big break only came after a compromise between the restaurant industry and unions that ended months of fighting between the two parties. The Service Employees International Union championed the legislation, saying it would improve workers' lives and help with industry turnover. Quick-service restaurants argued that they were being unfairly targeted and the wage hike would burden their businesses. \"I firmly believe that everyone should be entitled to a fair wage. The issue that I and my colleagues in this industry have is that we, as an industry, were targeted,\" said Kerri Harper-Howie, who runs WEH Organization and its 25 McDonald's locations in Los Angeles County with her sister, Nicole Harper-Rawlins.. \"If someone works at Macy's and they're making minimum wage, or they work at CVS ... They also should deserve that increase in wages.\" California hasn't supported a wider minimum-wage increase. Last November, just months after the fast-food pay floor went into effect, voters in the state struck down a ballot measure that would have raised the statewide minimum wage to $18 an hour. It reportedly was the first time in nearly three decades that voters shot down a statewide minimum wage hike on any state ballot.For now, other states have yet to follow California's lead, as the nation monitors the effects of the law and the restaurant industry continues to lobby against it. A scramble for franchiseesA McDonald's worker prepares to deliver an order at a McDonald's restaurant on May 8, 2024 in San Francisco, California. Justin Sullivan | Getty ImagesBroadly, the restaurant industry struggles with razor-thin profit margins. Labor is typically the biggest cost, and operators often aim to keep it roughly 30% of their overall costs. The higher minimum wage has been yet another challenge for operators, on top of commodity inflation and weakness in consumer spending.\"What we can say without a doubt is that it's really tough to operate any restaurant, any concept, any size, in California right now,\" said Sean Kennedy, executive vice president of public affairs for the National Restaurant Association, a major trade group that opposed the wage hike. For 17 months after the higher minimum wage went into effect, Harper-Howie's WEH Organization saw its same-store sales decline. The trend finally reversed in October, as McDonald's rounded the one-year anniversary of an E. coli outbreak that sent company-wide sales plunging by double-digits overnight. The burger chain more broadly has seen its U.S. performance struggle, although it reported same-store sales growth in the third quarter.\"For a long period of time, we were just bleeding money,\" said Harper-Howie, who formed the California Alliance of Family Owned Businesses with fellow McDonald's franchisees to push back against the California legislation.Harper-Howie estimates that her restaurants passed along price increases of less than 10% to customers. Raising prices further would be difficult amid a pullback in dining across the restaurant industry, particularly from low-income consumers. Plus, she said other minimum-wage workers who frequent McDonald's didn't receive the same pay hike, which made the food \"unaffordable for many.\"Harshraj Ghai, who operates more than 200 Burger King, Taco Bell and Popeyes locations across California and Oregon, has similarly raised menu prices by roughly 10% to 12% at California locations. That wasn't enough to offset the wage increases, Ghai said.To further mitigate the higher costs, Ghai has worked to cut labor hours by testing artificial intelligence to take drive-thru orders, using pre-cooked bacon for breakfast and adding automatic batter mixers.\"The cost and maintenance of of these technologies starts to become a little bit better than it would to pay somebody to actually do it,\" he said. The wage hike was just one more rapidly increasing cost for franchisees to wrangle. For example, Harper-Howie said WEH's insurance costs have soared, on top of rising prices for beef and other key ingredients. The Los Angeles wildfires put more pressure on Harper-Howie's business. One of her locations was temporarily closed, but the bigger blow came from the shrinking traffic as fires raged across the county, displacing many residents and scaring off tourists. Trump's hardline immigration stance has been another issue. \"Our employees are predominantly Latino, and they're terrified,\" Harper-Howie said. \"That's all of our hourly workers, our general managers, our shift managers, our department managers, and supervisors — and it's our customers.\"Harper-Howie said that she hasn't had to close any restaurants yet, crediting WEH's decades in the McDonald's system after her parents joined the franchise in the 1980's.But that isn't the case for Ghai, who has had to shutter some unprofitable locations permanently. He said that he's shuttered roughly 10 California locations over the last year and half, and he anticipates shuttering another 12 over the next year or two. While closures are a typical part of a large-scale restaurant business, those closures are much steeper than normal for Ghai, he said.For comparison, Ghai operates only Taco Bell restaurants in Oregon, but those locations are \"significantly more profitable\" than those in California, he said. He hasn't had to close any of his Oregon Taco Bells, but he has closed at least three in California. Taco Bell broadly has outperformed the broader fast-food industry over the last year, helped by its value perception and strong brand equity.Meanwhile, Kennedy said some franchisors are choosing to refranchise their California restaurants, collecting franchising fees in place of the headaches of operating the locations themselves.Despite higher labor costs, California is still a desirable market for fast-food chains. The state added nearly 2,300 fast-food restaurants from the first quarter of 2024 to the first quarter of 2025, according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. That increase represents a 5% jump, faster than the rest of the country's growth of 2% and outpacing California's increase of 2% in the year-ago period, based on analysis by the California Fast Food Workers Union.A lifeline for workersAn employee hands items to a customer at the drive-thru of a Jack in the Box restaurant in Los Angeles, California, US, on Monday, April 1, 2024.Eric Thayer | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesWhile the mandated pay hike brings another challenge for restaurant operators, workers see it as a win, even if it means fewer scheduled hours.For Zane Marte, 28, the pay bump meant that he could offer more support to his family and buy some of his own groceries, rather than leaning on his parents.Marte worked for Jack in the Box in the San Jose area for seven years. When he started, he earned $12 an hour. Over time, his pay crept up, lifted by raises and eventually a promotion to a management position. Still, until the $20 fast-food wage went into effect, his hourly pay was still several dollars below the new pay floor. His experience aligns with research from the University of California Berkeley's Center on Wage and Employment Dynamics. Researchers Michael Reich and Denis Sosinskiy found that the average pre-policy wage for fast-food workers in California was $17.13 an hour, suggesting that the average hourly pay hike after the $20 minimum took effect was about 17%. A separate report from the University of Kentucky published in April found that hiring for fast-food jobs fell after the new pay floor was implemented. However, turnover shrank as the higher wages encouraged workers to stick around. That decline in turnover offset a slowdown in hiring for fast-food workers in California, according to the report.Historically, turnover has been a major problem for the fast-food industry. Hiring and training new workers is expensive and time consuming for operators. For his part, Marte left Jack in the Box months after receiving the raise after he said he grew \"fed up\" with his manager. He has since left California and found employment using his college degree.Before the higher minimum wage went into effect, one concern from operators and trade groups was that other restaurants not included in the policy would have to raise their own wages to stay competitive — which critics said could be particularly hard for small businesses. But that fear largely doesn't seem to have been realized.The Berkeley study did not find any evidence of a spillover into the wages of workers at full-service restaurants chains such as Denny's, Applebee's, Buffalo Wild Wings, Red Robin and Outback Steakhouse. And more broadly, the researchers from the University of Kentucky did not find evidence that other non-food, low-wage employers raised their pay. The slowdown in fast-food hiring meant that other employers didn't have to worry much about their workers leaving for those jobs. Research from the Shift Project, a partnership between Harvard and the University of California San Francisco, found that the wage hike did not result in employers cutting scheduled hours or lead to understaffing in the immediate aftermath of the policy. Anecdotally, however, some fast-food restaurants have cut back their hours. For example, Julia Gonzalez, 21, lives in Los Angeles and works at Pizza Hut and Yoshinoya, a Japanese fast-food chain with roughly 100 locations in California. She told CNBC that she's been scheduled for fewer hours, but the increased wages still mean that she's able to save more money. (Gonzalez is affiliated with the California Fast Food Workers Union, which was a proponent of the industry's higher minimum wage.)Harper-Howie also told CNBC that her restaurants cut the number of overall labor hours because of slumping sales, as higher menu prices scared away diners.Meanwhile, the number of fast-food job losses caused by the policy is still hotly debated.Analysis of BLS data by the Employment Policies Institute, which opposes minimum wage hikes, found that roughly 16,000 fast-food jobs in California have been eliminated since Newsom signed the law in September 2024. However, Reich and Sosinskiy reported no related job losses using employment data that was adjusted to remove seasonal fluctuations, citing California's more temperate climate than the rest of the country.For his part, Newsom, widely believed to be a frontrunner for the 2028 presidential election, still includes it in lists of his policy wins as California governor.\"After raising the minimum wage for workers, California now has 750,500 fast food jobs — the MOST in state history! California's fast food industry continues to boom every single month with workers finally receiving the wages they deserve,\" he wrote in a post on X in August last year.",

    "body": "Dario Amodei, co-founder and CEO of artificial intelligence startup Anthropic.Chesnot | Getty ImagesAnthropic on Monday announced Claude Opus 4.5, its latest artificial intelligence model that the startup says excels at coding, using computers and assisting users with complex enterprise tasks. Claude Opus 4.5 marks Anthropic's third major model launch in two months, and it serves as the latest example of the nonstop pace of development within the AI industry. The startup unveiled its Claude Sonnet 4.5 model in late September, followed by its Claude Haiku 4.5 model in October. \"The amount that we're releasing to the market and the feedback loops that we're generating from it just make me so unbelievably excited,\" Scott White, product leader for Claude.ai at Anthropic, told CNBC in an interview.Anthropic is an AI startup that was founded by a group of former OpenAI researchers and executives in 2021. Microsoft and Nvidia announced multi-billion-dollar investments in Anthropic last week, boosting the AI lab's valuation to about $350 billion. The company is best known for developing a family of AI models called Claude. It assigns new numbers to the models as they advance across generations, but the largest model in the family is typically called Opus, the midsized model is called Sonnet and the smallest model is Haiku. The last Opus model, which Anthropic released in August, was called Claude Opus 4.1. Read more CNBC tech newsNvidia is king in AI chips, but Google and Amazon want to catch up by making their ownGoogle must double AI compute every 6 months to meet demand, AI infrastructure boss tells employeesFeds charge 4 in plot to export restricted Nvidia chips to China, Hong KongJoby lawsuit accuses air taxi rival Archer of using stolen information to ‘one-up’ dealThe ideal users for Claude Opus 4.5 will be professional software developers and knowledge workers like financial analysts, consultants and accountants, White said. People who are \"excited to push their own creativity, build new things, expand their professional purview\" will also find the model useful, White added. The new model is \"meaningfully better\" at everyday tasks like working with spreadsheets and slides and conducting deep research, Anthropic said in a blog.Claude Opus 4.5 is also state-of-the-art for agentic coding, outperforming rival models like Google's Gemini 3 Pro, which was announced last week, and OpenAI's GPT-5.1, according to SWE-bench Verified, a test set that measures an AI system's software coding abilities. Anthropic said it tested Claude Opus 4.5 on a difficult take-home exam that it gives to prospective performance engineers, and the model scored higher than any human candidate ever had. Claude Opus 4.5 will be available everywhere, and it will be the default model for Anthropic's Pro, Max and Enterprise offerings.In addition to the model launch, Anthropic announced several other product and feature updates on Monday. Claude for Chrome, the startup's extension that allows Claude to take action across browser tabs, is expanding to all Max users, the company said. Claude for Excel, which can understand and edit spreadsheets, is now generally available to all Max, Team and Enterprise users.Anthropic is also bringing Claude Code to its desktop app and adding new capabilities to its developer platform. WATCH: Anthropic valued in range of $350B following investment deal with Microsoft, Nvidiawatch now",

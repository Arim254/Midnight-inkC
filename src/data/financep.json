    "body": "In 2019, Chanel Rivers took a trip to London that would change the entire trajectory of her life.Born and raised in New York, Rivers, now 35, says she was tired of the dating scene and worrying about her safety in the Big Apple. She booked a trip to London with a friend and realized how comfortable she felt walking around the city, something she no longer felt in New York.\"I remember just walking around London and being like, 'I feel like this is where I'm supposed to be.' It was a feeling that came over me,\" Rivers says. \"In London, I just feel like my anxiety has lessened a lot, which is great.\"Shortly after Rivers got back to New York, she started figuring out how to return to London permanently, but the Covid-19 pandemic brought her plans to a complete halt. During the pandemic, Rivers met her now fiancé, Martin, an architect from Canada who was living and working in New York.Rivers was born and raised in New York.Chanel RiversAfter four and a half years of dating, Rivers brought up moving to London again to her fiancé. She admits that the feeling of wanting to move didn't go away, and she didn't see herself being in New York long-term anymore.\"I considered Canada, and we did look at Vancouver, but it was not city enough for me. Being from New York, I needed a big city. London was always the plan for me in my heart,\" she says.Around the same time that Rivers brought up getting the move to London going, her fiancé's job offered him a position in their office there. It was something she says was \"very serendipitous but meant to be.\"Since Martin was already a U.K. citizen, Rivers only needed to apply for a partner visa, which was approved in March 2024.Chanel is part of small but growing trend of Americans relocating to the U.K. More than 6,000 U.S. citizens applied to either become British subjects or to live and work in the country indefinitely from March 2024 to March 2025, the most since the U.K.'s Home Office began keeping records in 2004, according to The Guardian.Hello, LondonIn October 2024, the couple moved into a two-bedroom, one-bathroom apartment with a private garden in West London without ever seeing it in person. The rent was 2,400 pounds or USD $3,159 when they first moved in and has since increased to 2,515.20 pounds or $3,311, according to documents reviewed by CNBC Make It.The apartment was unfurnished, in a townhouse rather than a larger building, and didn't have a doorman, unlike the modern one they lived in back in New York City. The couple didn't ship any of their furniture over because it was too expensive. The first night they spent in the apartment, they slept in sleeping bags on the floor and used their suitcases as a dining table.\"We wanted something with character. We told ourselves we wanted something different when we moved here and we wanted something that felt very London so that we had a different living experience than we did in the U.S.,\" Rivers says.Rivers, her fiancé and their dog moved to London in October 2024.Chanel RiversRivers was able to keep her $120,000 a year job in event planning and marketing through the end of 2024.After that, she started looking for a position in London, which she says helped her explore the city as she traveled for interviews and worked out of local coffee shops. Rivers says she never had homesickness or regretted the move, but she admits that she was still nervous about being in a new city. \"I was so intimidated by London because it's so big and I was kind of scared to go out on my own. I don't know what happened to that brave girl from 2019, but I guess everything just felt so real now, and it was hitting me,\" she adds.One year later and the cost of living in LondonNow that Rivers and her fiancé have lived in London for a little over a year, they have settled in nicely, she says. Rivers found a London-based job working as an event planner. Rivers did not want to disclose her salary, but says that although she did take a pay cut, she's happy with it and spends less money than she did while living in New York. \"I've found that I generally spend less now, mostly because I'm not socializing as much as I did in New York. In London, life is a bit quieter but in a good way,\" she says. \"I still make time to see new friends and meet new people but I go out less. Plus, since I earn less here, I'm more mindful about where my money goes.\"Rivers and her fiancé also split their expenses proportionally based on their incomes. \"My fiancé makes the equivalent of what he made in the U.S., so he's kind of carrying the team right now, which is great,\" she adds.Rivers and her fiancé moved into an apartment without seeing it in person.Chanel RiversRivers' share of the monthly living expenses breakdown is as follows, according to documents reviewed by CNBC Make It:Rent = 1,215 pounds or $1,599Cellphone = 49.70 pounds or $65Internet/Wi-Fi = 20 pounds or $26Water = 59.78 pounds or $79Electricity = 121 pounds or $159Groceries = 300 pounds or $395Transportation = 115 pounds or $151Amazon Prime = 8.99 pounds or $12Pet insurance = 25.21 pounds or $33Apple TV = $12.99Rivers' biggest monthly expenses are rent, groceries and electricity, she says. She commutes to the office three times a week and tends to buy lunch on those days. Since moving to London, Rivers and her fiancé say they have also been able to take advantage of the city's location by taking local day trips on the train and traveling to Ireland and Mallorca. \"It's really nice to have easier access to traveling. I feel like in the U.S., you go on a trip once a year and that's it. It's nice that we can hop on a train and go to Paris for a night or hop on a plane and go to Spain,\" she says. \"The traveling is also a big part of why we wanted to move. Despite it taking a while to get settled, Rivers says she feels they made the right decision.\"I've only felt like this is the right path and where I'm supposed to be. Even the mundane things I do here excite me,\" she says. \"I feel like I'm probably in a honeymoon phase but I feel every day that I made the right choice. I don't think I see myself living in the U.S. now that I know what it's like to live a lifestyle outside of that.\"Rivers says she doesn't see herself moving back to the U.S.Chanel RiversRivers says moving back to the U.S. probably isn't in the cards for her, but she could eventually get on board with moving to Canada after living out her London dream for a few more years. \"Canada wasn't as exciting for where I'm at in life right now. I wanted something a little bit more exciting, like New York, but different. I think when I get older, if we were to move back and we wanted to be closer to family, then Canada would be the place we move to,\" she says.Conversions from British Pounds to USD were done using the OANDA conversion rate of 0.76 pounds to $1 USD on Nov. 11, 2025.

    "body": "At 88 years old, renowned actor Morgan Freeman is still starring in movies and using his distinctive voice to narrate films. His acting career spans six decades, and he isn't looking to retire, according to AARP.Freeman told the nonprofit that he plans to \"keep moving.\" And he pairs that sentiment with the advice he received from his dear friend and fellow actor, Clint Eastwood.\"There is a saying about old age — 'Keep moving' — and what Clint Eastwood, 95, says: 'Don't let the old man in,'\" Freeman told AARP earlier this month.\"The way to do that is to keep getting up in the morning, keep working out in the gym, keep taking your vitamins, keep taking your prescribed meds, and keep moving. Keep moving. That is the secret to it all.\"And Freeman is doing just that. This year, he starred in the third installment of the \"Now You See Me\" movie franchise, reprising his role as Thaddeus Bradley.Common suggestions from centenarians and people over the age of 80 are to stay active and to never retire. Those tips align with the rules of ikigai, a Japanese principle that is often linked to longevity and wellness.You get the most movement out of golf at my age. It's a great sport for older adults.In his free time, much of what Freeman does aligns with his hack for longevity, which is to keep moving. A passion of his is playing golf, and he believes it's a wonderful sport to keep up with at his age.\"You get the most movement out of golf at my age, mind you,\" Freeman said. \"It's walking, stooping, bending, swinging, cussing. It's a great sport for older adults.\"As Freeman nears 90, his primary concern is if advancing in age will affect his ability to play the sport he loves. \"Will I still be playing golf? That's the question,\" he said.Another important choice that Freeman made throughout his acting career was never letting his accolades get to his head, even after he won an Oscar in 2005. That's the same advice he has for actors and actresses who aspire to achieve the same today.\"It didn't change me one whit. I kind of knew early on that I would eventually get one. It didn't change me. I hope it didn't change me,\" Freeman said. \"Because the only change you can expect after you've gotten an Oscar is maybe your price goes up a tiny bit and your job prospects go up a bit. That's the one thing or two things I guess you could look forward to. Other than that, don't let your ego get the best of you.\"Black Friday sale: Want to up your AI skills and be more productive? Get 25% off our most popular course of the year, How to Use AI to Be More Successful at Work, with coupon code GETSMART.

    "body": "Boaz Weinstein is calling for the removal of the entire board of a tech-focused fund managed by Baillie Gifford, in a bid to reverse what the activist investor sees as \"unprecedented\" value destruction.In a letter to the Edinburgh Worldwide Investment Trust's board on Thursday, Weinstein — whose activist investment firm Saba Capital owns around 30% of shares in the trust — said the board has \"objectively and categorically failed\" to deliver the performance expected by shareholders.EWIT's portfolio comprises a global mix of smaller and emerging public and private companies focused on tech innovation and transformation, that target \"significant disruptive growth potential,\" according to the London-listed Baillie Gifford's website. Its holdings include Elon Musk's Space Exploration Technologies, or SpaceX, which makes up 8.4% of its portfolio.Weinstein said EWIT's net asset value is down 30.8% over the past five years, while its share price return has fallen 35%, having \"massively underperformed\" its self-selected benchmark, the FTSE All-Share Index, which is up 71.4% over the same period.That means the company's NAV return and share price performance ultimately lag the benchmark by more than 100% over the five-year period, Saba noted in the letter.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconEdinburgh Worldwide Investment Trust.\"The magnitude of this value destruction is unprecedented among peer U.K. equity investment trusts over this period,\" Weinstein wrote.Jonathan Simpson-Dent, chair of EWIT, expressed disappointment with Saba's open letter.He said EWIT's benchmark is the S&P Global Small Cap Index — not the FTSE All-Share Index cited in Weinstein's letter.\"It makes little sense to judge a global small-cap trust against a U.K. all-cap benchmark,\" Simpson-Dent said in a statement, adding that EWIT's NAV total return has been 17.5% to date, ahead of the S&P Global Small Cap Index's 4.8%. Saba Capital's representatives did not immediately respond to a request for comment on this point.The trust's total assets stood at £847.15 million ($1.1 billion) as of Oct. 31. Weinstein is calling for a general meeting to appoint a new board composed solely of \"qualified, independent directors… committed to delivering long-term value for all shareholders.\"\"We remain profoundly frustrated by the board's prolonged inertia,\" the activist investor wrote in the letter on Thursday. \"We do not have faith in the current Board's ability to implement the necessary strategic changes.\"Simpson-Dent said EWIT's board will continue to seek \"constructive dialog\" with Weinstein toward an \"equitable and holistic\" solution, including return of capital. But he warned: \"While we are open to discuss Board composition with Saba, we would strongly reject any proposal to replace the entire Board and the ambiguity that would follow.\"He added: \"The company's actions over the last year have supported a tightly managed discount, currently 5.6%, significantly narrower than the Global Smaller Companies peer group weighted average discount of 10.9%.\"The move follows an earlier attempt by Saba last year to shake up the EWI trust's board, a bid which ultimately failed to win investor support.Weinstein — whose New York-based $6 billion hedge fund trades credit relative value opportunities — has built a number of positions across the U.K. investment trust space lately. Outlining two new bets at the annual Sohn London investment conference last week, he said there is \"a storm brewing\" in the U.K. investment trust sector where discounts have widened sharply.",

    "body": "We're often inundated with relationship advice that rarely captures the complexity of what actually makes love work.As a couples counselor with a decade of experience working with couples and individuals trying to find and stay in love, I've found that one of the most underrated signs of a healthy and resilient relationship is a concept called \"mutual influence.\"Coined by married psychologists Drs. John and Julie Gottman, mutual influence means that you are willing to let your partner's needs, vulnerabilities, and perspectives shape you, and even change something about your own behavior.This quality generally only comes into focus during moments of tension or disagreement, not during easy harmony. At the beginning of a relationship, everyone is usually on their best behavior, which can make this valuable green flag hard to spot early on. Here's how to identify and develop it in your own relationship.  What mutual influence looks like In a 2020 study, psychologists followed nearly 320 couples and found that when both partners felt their voice truly mattered and could genuinely impact the other, relationship quality stayed high and emotional security deepened over the years. Couples who ignored this dynamic stagnated and became more insecure as their satisfaction with their relationship eroded.​When both partners experience mutual influence, the psychologists found that relationships not only feel fairer, but they actually are more stable and loving. Individuals report less anxiety about their partner's commitment, and small conflicts are less likely to snowball into chronic gridlock.This is what mutual influence looks like in practice:Setting your phone aside when your partner says, \"I need you to really hear me right now.\"Going a different route on a road trip because your partner feels anxious about traffic, even if you think your way is faster. Deciding to spend the holidays with their family this year after hearing how much it means to them, even though your tradition was always different. Choosing to pause a personal project for the evening because your partner asks for some help finishing theirs. Switching off the lights when they mention they have a headache.Accepting their feedback about how you speak during disagreements and choosing to change your tone or words, not because you have to, but because you want them to feel safer and closer to you. Mutual influence isn't about giving up your identity in your relationship or shelving what you need for the sake of keeping the peace. True openness means maintaining your values, while still making room for your partner's experience, especially when the two of you don't see eye-to-eye. You are creating a shared life where both of your voices matter.How to develop mutual influence in your relationshipEach week, consciously make one accommodation that you know is important to them. This could be a habit of yours, or making room for a preference of theirs. This signals to your partner that you hear them. So try their restaurant pick, take their suggested route, adjust the thermostat to their ideal temperature. Being flexible in low-stakes moments makes it far easier to access that quality during high-stakes ones.During conflict, I'm also a big fan of asking the question: \"What am I missing that would help this make more sense?\" It's a disarming query because it shows that you're not fighting to be right, but to better understand what's going on in your partner's head.These are small gestures that might look insignificant from the outside, but over time, they create the sense of being considered, included, and influential, which are the conditions where real intimacy takes root. That is what separates the couples who merely coexist from those who continually grow closer.​Baya Voce is a relationship expert who helps couples come back together after conflict.

Michael Nagle | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesThe U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating Jefferies' relationship into bankrupt auto parts maker First Brands Group, The Financial Times reported Thursday. The newspaper, citing people with knowledge of the matter, said the regulator is looking into whether Jefferies gave investors enough information on its Point Bonita fund's exposure to the failed auto business. The inquiry into internal controls and potential conflicts within the bank is at an early stage, the report said. It's not clear whether it will result in any allegations of wrongdoing. Jefferies came under pressure last month after its exposure to First Brands — which collapsed under a series of complex debt agreements — raised fears of other bad loans on Wall Street.

Alexander Kazakov | Afp | Getty ImagesRussian President Vladimir Putin has broken his silence on a U.S.-backed peace plan to end the war in Ukraine, saying Moscow is ready for \"serious\" discussions about the draft proposals.Putin said Thursday that the outlines of a fledgling peace plan that has been reached by the U.S. and Ukraine could be the basis of a deal that ends the almost four-year long conflict.\"In general, we agree that this can be the basis for future agreements,\" Putin said in comments made during a trip to Kyrgyzstan and translated by Reuters.The president added that the U.S. appeared to be taking Russia's position on a peace settlement \"into account\" and that Moscow was ready for \"serious discussions\" when U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff travels to Moscow next week for talks.It's the first time Putin has publicly addressed a peace plan since a flurry of diplomacy between the U.S. and Ukraine in the last few days. Those talks came after reports last week of a U.S.-Russia devised 28-point peace plan, which appeared to heavily favor Russia's demands.  Ukraine and its European allies' scrambled to mount a response, amending the plan and inserting counter proposals which were discussed in Geneva last weekend with a U.S. delegation led by U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio. All eyes on RussiaThe current draft plan, which has reportedly been slimmed down to 19 key proposals, appears to have received Ukraine's tentative backing, putting the ball back in Russia's court as to whether it could accept the framework and build upon it.On Wednesday, Putin's close aide Yuri Ushakov had claimed that Russia had not even seen an official version of the latest U.S.-backed draft deal for Ukraine, but that it had seen an unofficial version.Regarding the plan it had seen, Ushakov said the Kremlin viewed some aspects of the plan positively while \"several of its points require serious analysis.\"Sergei Ryabkov, Russia's deputy foreign minister, said Moscow welcomed U.S. efforts on peace proposals but said \"there are no concessions on key issues on the Ukraine settlement,\" suggesting there could be some distance to travel before a deal is actually reached. Putin's Press Secretary Dmitry Peskov warned on Wednesday against jumping to conclusions regarding an end to the war, which Russia launched when it invaded Ukraine in Feb. 2022.\"Wait. It's too early to say that,\" Peskov told reporters, state news agency TASS reported, when asked whether this was the closest Russia and Ukraine had ever been to concluding a peace agreement. Putin on Thursday praised Russian advances in Ukraine and told reporters that the fighting in Ukraine would stop only when Ukrainian troops withdraw from their positions in key areas. If they did not do so, then Russian forces would achieve their objectives by force, he added, appearing to suggest that Moscow was not willing to give up one of its key objectives in the war (and contained within the initial peace plan secretly drafted with the U.S.) which was to have full control of Ukraine's eastern Donbas region.CNBC has contacted the Kremlin for further comment and is awaiting a response.Ukraine on board, tentativelyMultiple outlets reported Tuesday that a Ukrainian delegation that had held talks with U.S. officials in Abu Dhabi on Tuesday appeared to tentatively support the basis of a U.S.-backed peace plan — though key details remained unresolved.ABC News and CBS News both reported an unnamed U.S. official had said that the Ukrainians \"have agreed\" to the deal, while adding there were still points that had to be ironed out. It was unclear if both stories quoted the same U.S. official.Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said later Tuesday that Kyiv was ready to advance the peace framework, Reuters reported, citing a copy of a speech the president gave to a coalition of allied countries.U.S. President Donald Trump said at the White House on Tuesday, \"I think we're getting very close to a deal. We'll find out ... I think we're making progress.\"In a Truth Social post later Tuesday afternoon, Trump said, \"there are only a few remaining points of disagreement.\"",

Apple denied the charges.The CCI's final verdict is still pending, but it said its \"prima facie view [is] that mandatory use of Apple's IAP for paid apps and in-app purchases restricts the choice available to the app developers to select a payment processing system of their choice,\" in an order in December 2021.Apple recorded its highest-ever quarterly shipments in India of 5 million units in the third quarter of 2025, according to data from IDC. watch nowThe company is expected to sell about 15 million iPhones in India this year and could rank among the top five smartphone companies there, Navkendar Singh, associate vice president with IDC India,  on Nov. 18.Apple is among the global companies diversifying their manufacturing supply chains away from China to India.

    "body": "Apple CEO Tim Cook holds up a new iPhone 17 Pro during an Apple special event at Apple headquarters on September 09, 2025 in Cupertino, California. Justin Sullivan | Getty ImagesApple is set to ship more smartphones than Samsung in 2025, the first time it will have done so in 14 years, Counterpoint Research said in a note on Wednesday.Apple will ship around 243 million iPhone units this year versus 235 million shipments from Samsung, Counterpoint told CNBC. Apple is likely to end up with a 19.4% share of the global smartphone market while Samsung's share will be 18.7%.Shipments refer to the number of devices vendors ship to retail channels and do not directly equal sales. However, they provide insights into demand and expectations of sales from smartphone makers.Apple's success is being driven by its iPhone 17 series launched in September, which, according to Counterpoint, had a \"bumper\" holiday sales season.Sales of the iPhone 17 series in the U.S. — including the iPhone Air — during the first four weeks after launch was 12% higher than that of the iPhone 16 series, excluding the iPhone 16e, the research firm said. In China, a critical market for Apple, sales of the iPhone 17 series during the same period were 18% higher than its predecessor.\"Beyond the highly positive market reception for the iPhone 17 series, the key driver behind the upgraded shipment outlook lies in the replacement cycle reaching its inflection point. Consumers who purchased smartphones during the COVID-19 boom are now entering their upgrade phase,\" Counterpoint Research Senior Analyst Yang Wang, said in the note. Samsung meanwhile, could face challenges in the low-to-mid tier of the smartphone market from Chinese players, which could hamper the South Korean giant's ability to reclaim the top spot, Counterpoint said. Apple longer-term boostCounterpoint Research forecasts Apple will hold the top spot in the global smartphone market through 2029. The analysts laid out a few reasons why.Firstly, 358 million second-hand iPhones were sold between 2023 and the second quarter of 2025. \"These users are also likely to upgrade to a new iPhone in the coming years. These factors will form a sizable demand base, which is expected to sustain iPhone shipment growth over the coming quarters,\" Counterpoint Research said.Apple benefited from a lower-than-expected impact from tariffs given the trade truce between the U.S. and China. This helped Apple's broader supply chain and growth in certain regions, such as emerging markets. The tech giant also benefited from a weaker U.S. dollar and a \"resilient economic outlook\" that boosted consumer confidence.\"With these structural tailwinds, Apple is well-positioned to surpass Samsung in annual shipments in 2025,\" Wang said.Meanwhile, Apple is expected to launch the entry level iPhone 17e next year as well as a foldable smartphone, Counterpoint forecast. The research firm said it expects the previously-announced improvements to Apple's virtual assistant Siri as well as a \"major iPhone design revamp\" in 2027, to also underpin Apple's dominance over the next few years.\"By expanding its lineup across multiple price tiers, including the growing \"e\" series, and potential adjustments to the Pro and Base launch cycles, Apple is strategically positioning itself to capture rising demand from aspirational consumers, particularly in emerging markets, and to strengthen its presence in the lower premium segment, which is projected to grow faster than the overall market,\" Counterpoint said.\"Given an increasing preference for the iOS ecosystem, compatibility between devices and a substantial number of older models within Apple's installed base due for renewal, Apple will retain the lead over other smartphone OEMs through the end of the decade.\"",

    "body": "Alibaba announced plans to release a pair of smart glasses powered by its AI models. The Quark AI Glasses are Alibaba's first foray into the smart glasses product category.AlibabaAlibaba's artificial intelligence-powered smart glasses went on sale on Thursday as the Chinese tech giant looks to ramp up its focus on consumer AI in an increasingly competitive market. The Quark AI Glasses, first announced in July, come in two variants — the S1, which starts at  3,799 Chinese yuan ($536) and G1 at 1,899 yuan.The tech giant has integrated its Qwen AI models — Alibaba's version of ChatGPT — with the device which also links to its newly-launched Qwen app. This means users can use voice control to get the glasses to carry out tasks.The lenses of the glasses are effectively screens and the device has a camera built into the frame. The main difference between the S1 and G1 is the display, Alibaba said.watch nowThe company said that some of the features include on-the-go translation, AI-generated meeting notes and the ability to ask the virtual assistants questions. Users take pictures of a product using the camera in the lens and then the device will show the price of that product on Taobao, Alibaba's main shopping app in China. Alibaba, like other technology companies such as U.S. giant Meta, are betting that smart glasses could be the next big consumer device after the smartphone.In September, Meta unveiled the $799 Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses, the social media company's first consumer-ready smart glasses with a built-in display. Users can control the device via hand gestures with a special wristband. Alibaba's glasses will initially go on sale in China and compete with domestic rivals, including consumer electronics maker Xiaomi and startup Xreal. The smart glasses market is still small but growing rapidly. By 2026, shipments of AI glasses are expected to exceed more than 10 million units, doubling from 2025, according to a forecast from Omdia. For Alibaba, the glasses are its latest play in the consumer AI market as it looks to build on its recent successes. The company's ChatGPT-style Qwen app got 10 million downloads in the first week of the public beta launch. Meanwhile, Alibaba's cloud computing business, where it books much of its AI-relate revenue, saw an acceleration of growth in the last quarter.The Hangzhou, headquartered company is one of the leaders in China's AI space, and has been investing aggressively in AI alongside rival giants like Baidu and Tencent, and aggressively launching new models.",

    "body": "watch nowMassachusetts Institute of Technology on Wednesday released a study that found that artificial intelligence can already replace 11.7% of the U.S. labor market, or as much as $1.2 trillion in wages across finance, health care and professional services.The study was conducted using a labor simulation tool called the Iceberg Index, which was created by MIT and Oak Ridge National Laboratory. The index simulates how 151 million U.S. workers interact across the country and how they are affected by AI and corresponding policy. The Iceberg Index, which was announced earlier this year, offers a forward-looking view of how AI may reshape the labor market, not just in coastal tech hubs but across every state in the country. For lawmakers preparing billion-dollar reskilling and training investments, the index offers a detailed map of where disruption is forming down to the zip code.\"Basically, we are creating a digital twin for the U.S. labor market,\" said Prasanna Balaprakash, ORNL director and co-leader of the research. ORNL is a Department of Energy research center in eastern Tennessee, home to the Frontier supercomputer, which powers many large-scale modeling efforts.The index runs population-level experiments, revealing how AI reshapes tasks, skills and labor flows long before those changes show up in the real economy, Balaprakash said. The index treats the 151 million workers as individual agents, each tagged with skills, tasks, occupation and location. It maps more than 32,000 skills across 923 occupations in 3,000 counties, then measures where current AI systems can already perform those skills.What the researchers found is that the visible tip of the iceberg — the layoffs and role shifts in tech, computing and information technology — represents just 2.2% of total wage exposure, or about $211 billion. Beneath the surface lies the total exposure, the $1.2 trillion in wages, and that includes routine functions in human resources, logistics, finance, and office administration. Those are areas sometimes overlooked in automation forecasts.The index is not a prediction engine about exactly when or where jobs will be lost, the researchers said. Instead, it's meant to give a skills-centered snapshot of what today's AI systems can already do, and give policymakers a structured way to explore what-if scenarios before they commit real money and legislation.The researchers partnered with state governments to run proactive simulations. Tennessee, North Carolina and Utah helped validate the model using their own labor data and have begun building policy scenarios using the platform.watch nowTennessee moved first, citing the Iceberg Index in its official AI Workforce Action Plan released this month. Utah state leaders are preparing to release a similar report based on Iceberg's modeling. North Carolina state Sen. DeAndrea Salvador, who has worked closely with MIT on the project, said what drew her to the research is how it surfaces effects that traditional tools miss. She added that one of the most useful features is the ability to drill down to local detail. \"One of the things that you can go down to is county-specific data to essentially say, within a certain census block, here are the skills that is currently happening now and then matching those skills with what are the likelihood of them being automated or augmented, and what could that mean in terms of the shifts in the state's GDP in that area, but also in employment,\" she said. Salvador said that kind of simulation work is especially valuable as states stand up overlapping AI task forces and working groups.The Iceberg Index also challenges a common assumption about AI risk — that it will stay confined to tech roles in coastal hubs. The index's simulations show exposed occupations spread across all 50 states, including inland and rural regions that are often left out of the AI conversation.To address that gap, the Iceberg team has built an interactive simulation environment that allows states to experiment with different policy levers — from shifting workforce dollars and tweaking training programs to exploring how changes in technology adoption might affect local employment and gross domestic product. \"Project Iceberg enables policymakers and business leaders to identify exposure hotspots, prioritize training and infrastructure investments, and test interventions before committing billions to implementation,\" the report says. Balaprakash, who also serves on the Tennessee Artificial Intelligence Advisory Council, shared state-specific findings with the governor's team and the state's AI director. He said many of Tennessee's core sectors — health care, nuclear energy, manufacturing and transportation — still depend heavily on physical work, which offers some insulation from purely digital automation. The question, he said, is how to use new technologies such as robotics and AI assistants to strengthen those industries rather than hollow them out.For now, the team is positioning Iceberg not as a finished product but as a sandbox that states can use to prepare for AI's impact on their workforces. \"It is really aimed towards getting in and starting to try out different scenarios,\" Salvador said.

I just buy the ones they send me.\"Two aisles over, a group of college students compared swatches of Korean cushion foundations. A dad asked a store associate whether a viral Korean sunscreen was the one \"from the girl who does the 'get ready with me' videos.\" Near the checkout, a display of Korean sheet mask mini-packs was nearly empty.Scenes like this are playing out across the country.Once a niche reserved for beauty obsessives, Korean cosmetics — known as K-beauty — are breaking fully into the American mainstream, fueled by TikTok virality, younger and more diverse shoppers, and aggressive expansion from retailers such as Ulta, Sephora, Walmart and Costco.K-beauty sales in the United States are expected to top $2 billion in 2025, up more than 37% from last year, according to market research firm NielsenIQ, far outpacing the broader beauty market's single-digit growth.And even as trade tensions complicate supply chains, brands and retailers told CNBC the momentum is strong.\"We have no plans of slowing down and see more opportunities to penetrate the market,\" said Janet Kim, vice president at K-beauty brand Neogen.In the first half of 2025, South Korea shipped a record $5.5 billion worth of cosmetics, up nearly 15% year over year, and has become the leading exporter of cosmetics to the U.S., surpassing France, according to data from the South Korean government.\"The growth has been remarkable,\" said Therese-Ann D'Ambrosia, vice president of beauty and personal care at NielsenIQ. \"When you compare that to the broader beauty market, which is growing at single digits, K-beauty is clearly operating in a different gear right now.\"Facial skin care remains the biggest K-beauty revenue driver in the U.S., NielsenIQ reported. Hair care is growing fastest, and hybrid items such as tinted serums and skin care-infused cushion compacts — sponge cushions soaked with an SPF foundation — continue to surge, the firm said.Big businessRetailers are racing to take advantage of the cosmetics boom, and a turf war is underway.Ulta, which has over 1,400 U.S. stores, launched \"K-beauty World\" in July, to spotlight Korean brands and tech devices. It's the only major U.S. retailer carrying products from Medicube, a beauty-tech company touted by celebrities such as Hailey Bieber. Ulta's first quarter 2025 report cited a 38% increase in Korean skin care sales, and executives said in August that new K-beauty partnerships contributed to the company beating Wall Street expectations for earnings in the second quarter. Sephora is leaning in as well. Its Times Square flagship location now features an entire wall of Korean skin care and cosmetics, and the retailer secured exclusive U.S. launches for Korean heritage brand Hanyul and sensitive-skin label Aestura.Big-box players are piling in too. Costco and Walmart have also expanded their assortments, adding essences, serums and sheet masks as demand accelerates.\"It's an arms race to see who can capitalize on the market for Korean products,\" Delphine Horvath, professor of cosmetics and fragrance marketing at the Fashion Institute of Technology, told CNBC. \"These products are now seen as a top driver of growth for cosmetic brands, and it seems it will keep booming.\"The competition is heating up just as Olive Young, often called the \"Sephora of Seoul,\" prepares to open its first U.S. store in Los Angeles next year. Asian beauty retailer Sukoshi is also expanding, planning 20 new stores in the coming year across cities such as Seattle, Miami, and Austin, Texas.\"Meeting customers where they can touch, feel and try what they see on TikTok is key,\" Sukoshi CEO Linda Dang told CNBC. \"Across the industry, companies are looking to expand partly because people really don't want to have to wait for shipping or travel all the way to Korea to get products.\"The boom arrives in the middle of the ongoing trade war.This spring, U.S. shoppers rushed to stock up on K-beauty favorites, bracing for price hikes from tariffs, Dang said. However, prices ultimately stayed relatively stable as Korean brands have temporarily absorbed the duties, Dang said, though many are now exploring alternative manufacturing or shipping methods.South Korea finalized a deal with President Donald Trump last month, settling on a 15% tariff rate instead of the initial 25% levy the president announced in April.\"The system of easy trading isn't what it was before tariffs,\" Dang told CNBC. \"That being said, a lot of companies have worked with advertisers and internally to do their best to offset and prevent passing those costs on to customers in the U.S.\"A visitor tries Korean-made cosmetics during the 2022 Korea Tourism Organization's Discover Your Korea, in Vanderbilt Hall of Grand Central Terminal, New York.Lev Radin | Pacific Press | Lightrocket | Getty ImagesThe 'second wave'Over the past decade, there's also been a rise in Korean entertainment in the U.S. — from pop groups such as BTS and Blackpink to this year's Netflix hit \"KPop Demon Hunters\" —which has helped push South Korea's cultural exports to unprecedented popularity.\"Korean culture has exploded on every front, and that has really shown up when it comes to K-beauty,\" Dang said.K-beauty's \"first wave,\" which hit the U.S. in the mid-2010s, was defined by \"glass skin,\" 10-step routines, snail mucin, cushion compacts and beauty blemish creams. Most products catered to lighter skin tones, and distribution was limited to small boutiques, Amazon sellers and early test placements at Ulta and Sephora, beauty experts said.\"The first wave had some penetration, but nothing like today,\" Horvath said. \"It was mostly people in the know.\"The second wave has been bigger, faster and far more inclusive. It has spanned color cosmetics, hair and scalp care, body care, fragrances and high-tech devices. TikTok is the central engine of discovery, especially for Gen Z and millennial shoppers, who account for roughly three-fourths of K-beauty consumers, according to a Personal Care Insights market analyst report. Posts tagged \"K-beauty\" or \"Korean skin care\" draw 250 million views per week, according to consumer data firm Spate. And viral products with sleek packaging often vanish from shelves faster than retailers can restock — particularly those that combine gentle formulas and low prices, Dang said.\"TikTok has changed the game,\" Horvath said. \"It's easier to educate consumers on innovation and get the word out. Brands are deeply invested in paying influencers, and TikTokers talk about textures, formulas and efficacy.\"Virality has also pushed brands to be more inclusive for younger and more diverse shoppers. After TikTok creators criticized Korean brand Tirtir for offering only three foundation shades, the company expanded to 40 shades within months and many other companies followed suit.The trend is visible across the Americas: 61% of consumers in Mexico and nearly half in Brazil say K-beauty is popular in their country, compared with about 45% in the U.S., according to Statista.\"Traditional retail and e-commerce remain important, but TikTok Shop is the standout disruptor,\" said Nielsen's D'Ambrosia. \"It's not just about the direct sales on that one platform; it's about how it's changing the entire discovery and purchase journey.\"But the second wave brings its own risks. A heavy dependence on virality could expose brands to sudden algorithm changes or regulatory scrutiny, D'Ambrosia said.\"When you have so much growth concentrated on one platform [such as TikTok], algorithm changes could significantly impact discoverability overnight,\" D'Ambrosia said. \"We've seen what happens when platforms tweak their recommendation engines. ... There are definitely some caution flags we're watching.\"Collagen eye patches and face masks at the Face Shop, which specializes in Korean beauty items, in San Francisco, April 15, 2015.Avila Gonzalez | San Francisco Chronicle | Hearst Newspapers | Getty ImagesRapid innovationK-beauty's staying power, Dang said, is rooted in an intensely competitive domestic Korean market. Trends move at breakneck speed and consumers spend more per capita on beauty than in any other country, according to South Korean research firm KOISRA.South Korea had more than 28,000 licensed cosmetics sellers in 2024 — nearly double that of five years ago — creating a pressure-cooker environment that forces constant experimentation, said Neogen's Kim.\"We develop about hundreds of formulas each day,\" Kim told CNBC. \"We build the library and we test results with clinical individual tests. ... Everything that's very unique and works really well for skin care, we develop.\"Korean consumers churn through trends quickly, fueling a pipeline of upstart brands that can go viral and, in some cases, get acquired. For example, when gooey snail mucin, a gel used to protect and repair people's skin, took off globally, skin care brand Amorepacific acquired COSRX, the small Korean brand that helped popularize the ingredient, for roughly $700 million.The next wave of products, analysts predict, are likely to be even more experimental. Brands are betting on buzzy ingredients such as DNA extracted from salmon or trout sperm that early research suggests may help calm or repair skin. They are also expanding into biotechnology.\"K-beauty is very data-driven. [Artificial intelligence] helps us get fast results for content, formula development, and advertising,\" Kim said. \"In Korea, they started talking about delivery systems. They're very good with biotechnology.\"watch now",

    "body": "Vcg | Visual China Group | Getty ImagesWhen ChatGPT launched in 2022, Google was caught flatfooted, but the launch of Gemini 3 and the Ironwood AI chip this month has experts raving about Alphabet's AI comeback. Google kicked off November by unveiling Ironwood, the seventh generation of its tensor processing units, or TPUs, that the company says lets customers \"run and scale the largest, most data-intensive models in existence.\" And last week, Google launched Gemini 3, its latest artificial intelligence model, saying it requires \"less prompting\" and provides smarter answers than its predecessors. Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff captured the excitement around Gemini 3 with a Sunday post on X, saying that despite using OpenAI's ChatGPT daily for three years, he wasn't going back after two hours of using Gemini 3. \"The leap is insane,\" wrote Benioff, whose company has partnerships with Google, OpenAI and other frontier AI model providers. \"Everything is sharper and faster. It feels like the world just changed, again.\"Most tech stocks were down to start the week, except for one: Alphabet. Shares of the Google parent surged more than 5% on Monday, adding to last week's gain of more than 8%. Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway revealed earlier this month that it owns a $4.3 billion stake in Alphabet as of the end of the third quarter. Alphabet shares are up nearly 70% this year and have outperformed Meta's by more than 50 percentage points this year, and last week, Alphabet's market cap surpassed Microsoft's.All of this came despite Nvidia reporting stronger-than-expect revenue and guidance in its third-quarter earnings last week.\"You may be asking why almost all of the AI stocks we cover are selling off after such good news from Nvidia,\" Melius Research analyst Ben Reitzes wrote in a note Monday, referring to Nvidia's positive third quarter earnings last week. \"There is one real reason for worry and it is the 'AI comeback' of Alphabet.\" But while Google appears to have regained the edge, its lead over rivals remains razor thin in the gruelingly competitive AI market, experts said. Sundar Pichai, chief executive officer of Alphabet Inc., during the Bloomberg Tech conference in San Francisco, California, US, on Wednesday, June 4, 2025. David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesPutting the pieces togetherWith Gemini 3 and Ironwood, Google CEO Sundar Pichai appears to have finally put the pieces together for the company's AI offerings, said Michael Nathanson, co-founder of equity research firm Moffett Nathanson. Google is serving a broad range of customers from consumers to enterprise, something the company initially struggled to do after the arrival of ChatGPT. \"Three years ago, they were seen as kind of lost and there were all these hot takes saying they lost their way and Sundar is a failure,\" Nathanson said. \"Now, they have a huge leg up.\"The company had a number of AI product mishaps in its initial attempts to catch up with OpenAI. In 2024 alone, Google had to pull its image generation product Imagen 2 for several months after users discovered a number of historical inaccuracies. The launch of AI Overviews caused a similar reaction when users discovered it gave faulty advice, which the company later remedied with additional guardrails.\"There was a lot of fumbling, and they were scrambling,\" said Gil Luria, managing director at technology research firm DA Davidson. \"But they had the tech in the pantry, and it was just a matter of getting it all together and shipped.\"Of particular note is how quickly Google launched Gemini 3 after the spring release of Gemini 2.5, which was already considered an impressive model. The hyper-realistic image generation features of Nano Banana is another notch in Google's belt. After the company initially launched the image generation tool, Gemini shot to the top of the Apple App Store in September, dethroning ChatGPT. And after the launch of Gemini 3, Google released Nano Banana Pro last week. Google's ownership of YouTube and all the content on the video platform gives the company an edge when it comes to training models for image and video generation. \"The amount of video and current data that Google has, that's really a huge competitive advantage,\" said Mike Gualtieri, vice president and principal analyst for Forrester Research. \"I don't see how OpenAI and Anthropic can overcome that.\"Additionally, Google has successfully incorporated its AI models into its enterprise products, driving sales for the company's cloud unit. In its third quarter earnings results last month, Google reached its first $100 billion quarter, boosted by its cloud growth. The company's cloud unit, which houses its AI services, showed solid growth and a $155 billion backlog from customers. And it's not just the AI models. Google is also garnering attention with its AI chips. Google says Ironwood is nearly 30 times more power efficient than its first TPU from 2018. Google's ASIC chips are emerging as the company's secret weapon in the AI wars and have helped it notch recent deals worth billions with customers such as Anthropic. After a report said that Meta could strike a deal with Google to use its TPUs for the social media company's data centers, Nvidia saw its stock drop 3% on Tuesday, prompting the chipmaker to post a response on social media. With the rise of Google's TPUs, Nvidia may no longer have the AI chips market cornered.\"The advantage of having the whole stack is you can optimize your model to work specifically well on a TPU chip and you're building everything to a more optimally designed,\" said Luria.The company's ability to serve AI enterprise customers with its TPUs and Google Cloud offerings as well as its incorporation of Gemini 3 throughout its consumer products is driving Wall Street's enthusiasm.Experts who spoke with CNBC said the competitive landscape is broader than just one AI winner, but they added that it's become increasingly expensive for multiple companies to prove success.Tight competitionDespite these wins, Google is still in fierce competition with other AI companies, experts said.\"Having the state of the art model for a few days doesn't mean they've won to the extent that the stock market is implying,\" Luria said, pointing to Anthropic's new Opus 4.5 model launched Monday. Earlier this month, OpenAI also announced two updates to its GPT-5 model to make it \"warmer by default and more conversational\" as well as \"more efficient and easier to understand in everyday use,\" the company said. \"The frontier models still seem to be neck and neck in some ways,\" Forrester Research's Gualtieri said.The competitive edge will likely go to the companies willing to spend more money given the expenses of the AI race, experts said. In their earnings reports last month, Alphabet, Meta, Microsoft and Amazon each lifted their guidance for capital expenditures. They collectively expect that number to reach more than $380 billion this year.\"These companies are spending a lot of money assuming there's gonna be a winner take all when in reality we may end up with frontier models being a commodity and several will be interchangeable,\" Luria said.For Google, maintaining a lead in AI won't be without challenges. Company executives told employees earlier this month that Google has to double its serving capacity every six month to meet demand for AI services and run its frontier models, CNBC reported last week. \"The competition in AI infrastructure is the most critical and also the most expensive part of the AI race,\" Google Cloud Vice President Amin Vahdat told employees.Although Google's in-house TPUs have gotten increased attention as viable alternatives to Nvidia's Blackwell chips, Nvidia still holds more than 90% of the AI chip market. In its post on Tuesday, Nvidia pointed out that its chips are more flexible and powerful than ASIC chips, like Google's Ironwood, which are typically designed for a single company or function.And despite getting Salesforce's Benioff to switch to Gemini, Google also has a lot of catching up to do with its consumer chat product, experts said, citing hallucinations and lower user numbers than OpenAI's.The Gemini app has 650 million monthly active users and AI Overviews has 2 billion monthly users, Google said last month. OpenAI, by comparison, said in August that ChatGPT hit 700 million users per week.  \"Yes, Google has got its act together,\" Luria said. \"But that doesn't mean they've won.\"WATCH: AI narrative is shifting towards Google with its complete stack, says Plexo Capital's Lo Toneywatch now",

Michael Nagle | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesBlack Friday is proving more popular for younger consumers than for their elders, according to a new report provided exclusively to CNBC.AT&T Business' 2025 Holiday Shopping Survey, conducted by Morning Consult, found that 40% of Generation Z members and 32% of millennials plan to do most of their shopping on Black Friday. Older generations, on the other hand, prefer to shop later in the season, just a week or two before Christmas, the survey found.  \"Black Friday is always such a big deal, and the pricing and the offers and advertising that's done during that time is probably what would draw Gen Z, especially things done on social media,\" said Angela Rutherford, AT&T's vice president of mid-market sales.The enthusiasm for Black Friday comes even as Gen Z plans to pull back their spending. Read more CNBC Black Friday newsShoppers curtail Black Friday spending: 'They are using every tool that they can,' expert saysBlack Friday is most popular with Gen Z, even as the holiday loses its shine, new survey findsBlack Friday car deals are sparser this year, analyst says: ‘Buyers may be a little disappointed’Pro: Wall Street’s favorite holiday shopping stocks as Black Friday nearsConsulting firm PwC reported in September that Gen Z shoppers plan to spend 23% less on average this holiday season than a year ago – the sharpest decline of any generation and a significant change from the previous year, when Gen Z said they planned to spend 37% more.And as non-wealthy Americans face pressures of higher prices and economic uncertainty, some reports are showing signs of a \"K-shaped\" economy that may stretch into the holiday season, with wealthier consumers spending more and lower-income consumers shopping more conservatively.A new Deloitte survey found that consumers at large plan to spend 4% less on Black Friday than they did last year, primarily due to concerns of financial constraints and a higher cost of living.Still, Rutherford said consumers are being more \"intentional and value-driven\" in their holiday shopping this year. That spending is translating into more support for small businesses rather than large legacy retailers, with 77% of consumers reporting they would do all of their holiday shopping at small businesses if they could and if the pricing was the same, according to AT&T's survey. Compared with last year, the number of survey respondents who said they shop at small businesses to boost their local economies grew by 8 percentage points. \"I think there's a price consciousness out there, combined with a, 'If I can still save money or get a good price, I will still shop local,' type of mentality out there,\" Rutherford said. The AT&T survey also found that 72% of people reported getting their gift ideas from in-person shopping rather than from social media. And even as artificial intelligence begins to reshape the way people shop, more than half of shoppers said they were more likely to use traditional online search methods for their gifting this holiday season than AI – just 9% of those surveyed said they are more likely to use AI to find gifts. \"AI has exploded over the last couple years, and it's infiltrating all aspects of life,\" Rutherford said. \"I think as time goes on, you will see a shift from the traditional search to AI for shopping.\"",

    "body": "Disney's \"Zootopia 2\" follows detectives Judy Hopps and Nick Wilde find themselves on the twisting trail of a mysterious reptile who turns the mammal metropolis of Zootopia upside down.DisneyMoviegoers have plenty to feast on at the box office this Thanksgiving.Disney's \"Zootopia 2\" snared $10.2 million in Tuesday previews, the second-highest haul for a Disney Animation Studios film ever, behind only last year's \"Moana 2,\" which took in $13.8 million. It's the eighth-highest preview for an animated movie of all time. Box office analysts expect the film to generate between $135 million and $150 million during the five-day Thanksgiving period. Although that will be significantly below the $225.4 million that \"Moana 2\" took in during the same period last year, it is a welcome jolt for a box office that has struggled in the last few months to drum up ticket sales.Also in the mix is Universal's \"Wicked: For Good,\" which tallied $147 million during its opening last week and is expected to bring in between $80 million and $100 million over the five-day holiday. That figure could be higher considering last year's \"Wicked\" tallied $118 million during the Thanksgiving frame after debuting to $112.5 million during the same pre-Thanksgiving weekend.\"The Thanksgiving holiday frame is one of the most important moviegoing periods of the year and is off to a running start with the overperforming 'Wicked: For Good' powering an impressive five days of box office revenue for movie theaters in the $300 million range,\" said Paul Dergarabedian, head of marketplace trends at Comscore. \"'Zootopia 2' has a perfect release date and built-in brand recognition and a revenue enhancing PG rating so that's a huge plus.\"Thanksgiving this year is facing tough comparisons after the 2024 holiday saw \"Moana 2,\" \"Wicked\" and \"Gladiater II\" fuel a record-breaking $424.9 million domestic five-day score. Previously, the highest-grossing Thanksgiving haul was $315.6 million, which was captured in 2018, according to data from Comscore.\"While that record is in no jeopardy of being broken, this year will nonetheless prove to be a solid Thanksgiving holiday corridor for movie theaters that will likely rank in the top five performing frames historically of all time,\" said Dergarabedian.Disclosure: Comcast is the parent company of NBCUniversal, which owns CNBC. Versant would become the new parent company of CNBC upon Comcast's planned spinoff of Versant.",

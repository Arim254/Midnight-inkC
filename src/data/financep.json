    "body": "Living alone with a $2,000 housing budget may be nearly impossible in some major cities — but in others you may be able to afford up to three bedrooms.Across the U.S., the average rent for a studio apartment listed on Apartments.com in October was $1,699 a month, and a two-bedroom space had an average rent of $1,887 per month, according to data collected and analyzed by Apartments.com in a November report. Of the 25 most populous cities in the U.S., New York, Boston and California cities San Francisco, San Diego and San Jose were the most expensive. Average rent for a studio apartment in these cities was over $2,000 in October, according to data from Apartments.com shared with CNBC Make It.With $2,000, you could get an average of 267 square feet in New York City, or one-third the size of a pickleball court, according to a normalized estimate from October listings. Compare that with Oklahoma City, the most affordable of the most populous cities, where $2,000 is worth about 1,900 square feet — more than two pickleball courts. While this data offers a useful benchmark for comparison across cities, it isn't necessarily indicative of the size of any single apartment a renter is likely to encounter. In reality, apartment sizes and prices can differ within the same city due to various factors, and renters should keep that in mind, the authors of the report said.Here's where $2,000 in rent would get you the least space in the 25 most populous cities in America:New York, N.Y.: 267 square feetBoston, Mass.: 336 square feetSan Francisco, Calif.: 340 square feetSan Diego, Calif.: 458 square feetSan Jose, Calif.: 427 square feetHere's where $2,000 in rent would get you the most space in the 25 most populous cities in America: Oklahoma City, Okla.: 1,900 square feetEl Paso, Texas: 1,762 square feetIndianapolis, Ind.: 1,676 square feetColumbus, Ohio: 1,633 square feetSan Antonio, Texas: 1,517 square feetHere's how much space you could get for $2,000 a month in all 25 of the most populous U.S. cities as of October.New York, N.Y.Unit type: N/A Average size for $2,000: 267 square feetLos Angeles, Calif.Unit type: StudioAverage size for $2,000: 530 square feetChicago, Ill.Unit type: One bedroomAverage size for $2,000: 679 square feetHouston, TexasUnit type: Three bedroomAverage size for $2,000: 1,443 square feetPhoenix, Ariz.Unit type: Two bedroomAverage size for $2,000: 1,230 square feetPhiladelphia, Pa.Unit type: One bedroomAverage size for $2,000: 772 square feetSan Antonio, TexasUnit type: Three BedroomAverage size for $2,000: 1,517 square feetSan Diego, Calif.Unit type: N/AAverage size for $2,000: 458 square feetDallas, TexasUnit type: Two bedroomAverage size for $2,000: 1,154 square feetJacksonville, Fla.Unit type: Three bedroomAverage size for $2,000: 1,453 square feetFort Worth, TexasUnit type: Three bedroomAverage size for $2,000: 1,305 square feetSan Jose, Calif.Unit type: N/AAverage size for $2,000: 427 square feetAustin, TexasUnit type: Two bedroomAverage size for $2,000: 1,186 square feetCharlotte, N.C.Unit type: Two bedroomAverage size for $2,000: 1,235 square feetColumbus, OhioUnit type: Three bedroomAverage size for $2,000: 1,633 square feetIndianapolis, Ind.Unit type: Three bedroomAverage size for $2,000: 1,676 square feetSan Francisco, Calif.Unit type: N/AAverage size for $2,000: 340 square feetSeattle, Wash.Unit type: StudioAverage size for $2,000: 534 square feetDenver, Colo.Unit type: One bedroomAverage size for $2,000: 852 square feetOklahoma City, Okla.Unit type: Three bedroomAverage size for $2,000: 1,900 square feetNashville, Tenn.Unit type: One bedroomAverage size for $2,000: 863 square feetWashington, D.C.Unit type: StudioAverage size for $2,000: 512 square feetEl Paso, TexasUnit type: Three bedroomAverage size for $2,000: 1,762 square feetLas Vegas, Nev.Unit type: Three bedroomAverage size for $2,000: 1,354 square feetBoston, Mass.",

    "body": "U.S. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) salutes former U.S. President Donald Trump during a rally in Commerce, Georgia, U.S. March 26, 2022. Alyssa Pointer | ReutersPresident Donald Trump on Saturday reacted to Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene's surprise resignation announcement, saying, \"Marjorie went BAD.\"Trump once again called the Georgia Republican a \"traitor,\" referencing Greene's alliance with Republican Rep. Tom Massie of Kentucky, who sponsored the bill demanding the release of the Jeffrey Epstein files by the Justice Department.Greene, who had been a close ally of Trump for years, cited backlash from the president over her advocacy for the bill in her statement, saying that her last day in the House of Representatives will be Jan. 5. \"Marjorie 'Traitor' Brown, because of PLUMMETING Poll Numbers, and not wanting to face a Primary Challenger with a strong Trump Endorsement (where she would have no chance of winning!), has decided to call it 'quits' \" Trump wrote early Saturday in a Truth Social post.\"Her relationship with the WORST Republican Congressman in decades, Tom Massie of Kentucky, also known as Rand Paul Jr. because he votes against the Republican Party (and really good legislation!), did not help her,\" Trump said.\"For some reason, primarily that I refused to return her never ending barrage of phone calls, Marjorie went BAD,\" he wrote.\"Nevertheless, I will always appreciate Marjorie, and thank her for her service to our Country.\"Trump had opposed the bill ordering the release of the Epstein files until the last minute. This week, the bill passed the House in a nearly unanimous vote and passed the Senate unanimously. The president then signed it into law.Trump spoke with NBC News later Saturday morning about Greene, saying, \"It's not going to be easy\" for her to have a future in Republican politics.\"I would like to see it,\" Trump told NBC.\"She's got to take a little rest,\" he said.\"I can patch up differences with anyone,\" Trump said when asked if he believes he can reconcile with Greene.Trump last week said he would support \"the right person\" if they challenged Greene in the Republican primary next year for her seat representing Georgia's 14th District.In her resignation statement on Friday night, Greene wrote, \"I have too much self respect and dignity, love my family too much, and do not want my sweet  district to have to endure a hurtful and hateful primary against me by the President we all fought for, only to fight and win my election while  Republicans will likely lose the midterms.\"\"And in turn, be expected to defend the President against impeachment after he hatefully  dumped tens of millions of dollars against me and tried to destroy me,\"  Greene said.\"I refuse to be a 'battered wife' hoping it all goes away and  gets better.\"\"Standing  up for American women who were raped at 14, trafficked and used by rich powerful men, should not result in me being called a traitor and  threatened by the President of the United States of America, whom I fought for.\"",

    "body": "Victoria Beckham, formerly Posh Spice of the Spice Girls, is known for her healthy habits and discipline when it comes to wellness.Since entering the spotlight three decades ago, the fashion designer's daily practices for peak health have evolved. While her diet remains consistent—fresh fish, vegetables, nuts, and seeds—her exercise routine and priorities have shifted now that she is in her 50s.Here are four ways Beckham's wellness routine has changed from the early 2000's to now.4 ways Victoria Beckham's wellness routine has changed1. She's more flexible with her diet\"I do try to be quite disciplined in the way that I eat,\" Beckham said on the BBC Radio program \"Gordon Ramsay's Perfect Christmas Lunch\" in 2006 at age 32.At the time, she prioritized a \"really healthy\" diet of fish, vegetables and fruit — and still does, she said. But these days Beckham is less rigid.\"I'm flexible with regards to food,\" Beckham told Net-a-Porter in 2020. \"My treat is a few glasses of red wine, and I also love tequila, and I do eat carbs. I have lots of avocado and really good fats, like salmon.\"2. She added weight training to her workoutsOver a decade ago, Beckham set a new year's resolution to start going to the gym, she told The Guardian in 2014. \"I've never stopped. Once I get into something, I do it properly,\" she said.Back then, she would exercise for 90 minutes with a trainer, attend SoulCycle classes and run often, sometimes for eight miles. By 2023, her workout routine looked much different.\"I usually workout every morning prior to beginning my day and recently incorporated strength training into my routine which has been a fun way to switch up my regime,\" Beckham said in an interview with Harper's Bazaar.The following year, she shared that weight training at 50 made her feel \"stronger than I did when I was 20.\"3. Sleep is key for her self care nowIn 2013, Beckham's three sons were still in school and her daughter was just one. Beckham started her days between 6:15 and 6:30 a.m., and would fall asleep sometime between midnight and 1 a.m., she told Harper's Bazaar that year.At the time, she was getting between five and six hours of sleep a night. \"I like to get as much sleep as I can. But when you're a mummy, you kind of—well, it would be nice,\" Beckham said.Ten years later, she told the publication that her best advice for self care was developing a healthy sleep routine.\"Creating healthy sleep habits is incredibly important; it's become a key part of my self-care practice,\" she said.\"I've been working on incorporating less screen time and more mindfulness into my routine, which means putting my phone away before bedtime.\"4. Wellness shots and green smoothies are a staple in her routineBeckham also gets plenty of nutrients and vitamins from her daily beverages.Earlier this year, Vogue covered Beckham's morning routine based on stories shared to her personal Instagram account. The first thing she consumes every morning is apple cider vinegar, \"a couple of tablespoons on an empty tummy,\" she said.Then, she and her husband David Beckham have their green smoothies which include:BroccoliSpinachCucumberCeleryAvocadoAppleGingerLemonAfter a workout, Beckham has another smoothie with berries, bananas, apples and almonds. She rounds out her morning with a wellness shot of lemon, black pepper, fresh ginger and turmeric. \"One shot a day!!\" she said.Earn more and get ahead with CNBC's online courses.

    "body": "An operator for Baker Hughes conducts a wireline survey on a Chesapeake Energy natural gas rig in the North Texas Barnett Shale near Burleson, Texas.Matt Nager | Getty ImagesCompany: Baker Hughes (BKR)Business: Baker Hughes is an energy technology company with a portfolio of technologies and services that span the energy and industrial value chain. The company operates in two segments: oilfield services and equipment and industrial and energy technology. The OFSE segment provides products and services for onshore and offshore oilfield operations across the lifecycle of a well, ranging from exploration, appraisal, and development, to production, rejuvenation, and decommissioning. OFSE is organized into four product lines: well construction; completions, intervention and seasurements; production solutions and subsea and surface pressure systems. The IET segment provides technology solutions and services for mechanical-drive, compression and power-generation applications across the energy industry, including oil and gas, liquefied natural gas operations, downstream refining and petrochemical markets, as well as lower carbon solutions to broader energy and industrial sectors.Stock Market Value: $47.84 billion ($48.48 per share)Activist: Ananym Capital ManagementOwnership: n/aAverage Cost: n/aActivist Commentary: Ananym Capital Management is a New York-based activist investment firm which launched on Sept. 3, 2024, and is run by Charlie Penner (a former partner at JANA Partners and head of shareholder activism at Engine No. 1) and Alex Silver (a former partner and investment committee member at P2 Capital Partners). Ananym looks for high quality but undervalued companies, regardless of industry. They would prefer to work amicably with their portfolio companies but are willing to resort to a proxy fight as a last resort. According to their most recent 13F filing, they manage $260 million across 10 positions.What's happeningOn Oct. 21, Ananym Capital announced that they have taken a position in Baker Hughes and are calling on the company to spin out its oilfield services and equipment business, arguing such a step could help push up the stock price by at least 60%.Behind the scenesBaker Hughes is a leading provider of energy and industrial technology services. The company was formed through the 2017 merger of legacy Baker Hughes and GE Oil & Gas, combining best-in-class intellectual property shared by GE spinoff assets and the technical expertise from both organizations. The company operates through two primary segments: industrial and energy technologies and oilfield services and Equipment. The IET unit (55% of projected 2025 revenue and 60% of projected 2025 EBITDA) is a long-cycle industrial and energy business focused on gas technology equipment, including turbines and compressors, and aftermarket services, including new energy applications. The OFSE unit (45%/40%) is a short-cycle oilfield equipment and production services business with an end-to-end portfolio of oilfield services and equipment for well construction and production.Management has built up a strong track record of effective execution, and that success has been reflected in the share price, with the company delivering strong returns of 28.26%, 75.29% and 232.98% over the past 1-, 3- and 5-year periods, respectively. Within IET, the company has taken advantage of its leading position in LNG, in which Baker now has 95% global footprint for the turbomachinery required in plant construction, a market that is expected to grow at a 10% compound annual growth rate through 2030. Additionally, the company has a strong position in power generation, as Baker is one of few original equipment manufacturers supplying smaller-scale turbines and complete behind-the-meter power solutions. These offerings have allowed the company to play a pivotal role in helping to address rapidly growing data center demand, as its data center orders have gone from $0 to $550 million in just two quarters. As such, management is heavily investing in this opportunity — developing larger-scale power systems to support mega-data center deployments. Furthermore, Baker's pending acquisition of Chart Industries is expected to further strengthen IET's position in power, LNG, and industrials. As a result, IET is approaching a 20% EBITDA margin, with further margin expansion expected as the business mix continues to shift toward aftermarket services, which generate long-term recurring revenue streams supported by contracts exceeding 10 years and margins of 35% or more. For OFSE, management has taken steps to meaningfully improve the segment's earnings mix and reduce its cyclical commodity exposure. This includes exiting or downsizing non-core ventures and low-margin product lines, such as its surface pressure control joint venture with Cactus; prioritizing the Middle East and international markets (now 75% of OFSE revenue), which are less correlated to commodity prices; and implementing strong pricing discipline and cost cutting measures by enforcing minimum margin thresholds on new contracts, consolidating product lines and simplifying reporting. However, despite these efforts, OFSE remains highly subject to commodity volatility, affecting both the segment's performance and the company's overall valuation. Currently valued at about 9x EBITDA, Baker trades more closely with oilfield services peers (6–7x EBITDA), than its industrial and energy technology peers (16–18x), despite IET being the majority of the company's revenue and EBITDA. An implied sum-of-the-parts multiple for Baker would put the company at approximately 13x. It is for this reason that Ananym has launched a campaign at Baker calling for the company to either continue growing IET relative to OFSE or to pursue a sale or spin of OFSE. Ananym believes that a potential separation could result in an about 51% immediate upside through realizing Baker's sum of parts valuation, even when assuming $100 million dis-synergies from separation. Moreover, this upside does not reflect much of the potential long-term growth tailwinds and margin expansion expected from these ongoing operational initiatives — value drivers that shareholders should also be better positioned to realize through such a move.Founded in September 2024, this is Ananym's third public activist campaign. Knowing Charlie Penner and Alex Silver as we do, we would expect them to strive to work amicably with management to create value for shareholders. As such, they have already expressed full confidence in management to choose the optimal path forward, and the company's strong operational track record fully supports that confidence. Moreover, on Oct. 6, the company announced a review of its capital allocation, business, cost structure, and operations. With all signs pointing towards alignment between the two parties, we do not expect that they will insist on, or even ask for, board representation or continue to engage in much more of a public campaign. Rather, we expect them to work amicably with Baker behind the scenes to unlock meaningful shareholder value. However, this cooperative approach should not be confused for weakness, as they are fiduciaries to their own investors and will do whatever is necessary to create value at their portfolio companies. Thus, should management fail to act decisively, Ananym could quickly shift to a more assertive stance.Ken Squire is the founder and president of 13D Monitor, an institutional research service on shareholder activism, and the founder and portfolio manager of the 13D Activist Fund, a mutual fund that invests in a portfolio of activist investments.",

    "body": "John Williams, president and chief executive officer of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, speaks during an Economic Club of New York (ECNY) event in New York, US, on Thursday, Sept. 4, 2025.David Dee Delgado | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesCommunication at the Federal Reserve, particularly at the highest levels, rarely happens by accident.Messages that come out of the top echelon, particularly the chair, vice chair and the powerful New York Fed president, are measured carefully, calibrated between delivering clear ideas about policy without causing undue reaction in financial markets.That's why a speech Friday from the current New York Fed leader, John Williams, mattered so much to markets. With his position comes membership in the Fed's leadership troika, a group that also includes Chair Jerome Powell and Vice Chair Philip Jefferson.So when Williams gave a nod to the likelihood of a \"further adjustment in the near term\" for interest rates, investors took it as a message from on high that the leadership is inclined for at least another rate cut sometime soon, likely at the December meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee.\"There is some ambiguity in the phrase 'near term' – but its most obvious reading is at the next meeting,\" Krishna Guha, head of global policy and central bank strategy at Evercore ISI, said in a client note. \"And while it is possible that Williams was offering a personal view, signals from the other members of the Fed leadership troika (vice-chairman, NY Fed president) on key live policy issues are almost always approved by the chair and it would be professional malpractice for him to deliver this signal without Powell's sign-off,\" he added.Williams' comments on rates come at an especially sensitive time for the Fed and financial markets.The policymaking FOMC, normally a consensus-driven group sometimes maligned for lacking diversity of thought, has found itself suddenly divided. On one side are officials who see policy as still holding back growth and open for adjustment, while the other is represented by those worrying about inflation who see solid economic growth with no need for further cuts, particularly in light of reductions already in the books from September and October.While Williams provided little insight into the longer-term trajectory of rate expectations, at least in the short term it looks like senior Fed leadership backs a cut.That's particularly important to financial markets that have wobbled lately over fears of an artificial intelligence bubble, coupled with ongoing geopolitical concerns and uncertainty over Fed monetary policy.Stocks rallied Friday, with futures turning around after Williams' comments caused a market repricing toward the expectation of a rate cut in December. Ongoing concerns about AI tempered the rally, but traders continued to place bets on a December move, assigning a 73% chance of a reduction, according to the CME Group's FedWatch gauge.Williams likely saved the market Friday from a potential sell-off that appeared to be taking shape, with stocks outside of tech mostly firm and supporting the major averages on the prospects of lower rates. The major benchmarks were hit hard Thursday and investors feared another big slide was coming Friday. Major averages vacillated through the morning but were at session highs heading into afternoon trading.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconS&P 500, 5 days\"Williams intervention came after several other Fed speakers indicated reservations about [December] but drew back from categorical statements, perhaps indicating they recognize the [December] struggle was turning into a crisis of governance at the Fed and see the need to give Powell space to make the call,\" Guha said. To be sure, other speakers weren't as enthusiastic as Williams.Regional Fed Presidents Susan Collins of Boston and Lorie Logan of Dallas both voiced hesitation about further cuts. In a CNBC interview, Collins expressed concern about inflation. Logan was even more hawkish, saying she wasn't even sure she would have voted for the previous two cuts. Collins votes this year on the FOMC, while Logan gets to vote in 2026.",

    "body": "President Donald Trump offered praise for New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani on Friday after the two men met for the first time at the White House to discuss the growing issue of affordability.While the Republican president and the Democratic mayor-elect have hurled searing attacks at each other in the recent past, they repeatedly shrugged off those words while appearing side by side in the Oval Office. At one point, when Mamdani was asked for the second time about having called Trump a \"fascist,\" the president gave him cover.\"That's OK, you can just say yes,\" Trump said after Mamdani began to respond. \"It's easier than explaining it.\"Trump also appeared to backtrack on his prior threat to withhold federal funding for New York City if Mamdani became its mayor. \"I don't think that's going to happen,\" Trump said.Instead of rehashing their feud, they talked up their areas of agreement on broad issues, especially focusing on lowering the cost of living.But they also found common ground on some more specific matters, such as getting NYC-based energy giant Con Edison to lower prices. \"We've gotten fuel prices way down, but it hasn't shown up in Con Edison, and we're going to have to talk to them ... to start lowering the rates,\" Trump said. \"Absolutely,\" Mamdani added.U.S. President Donald Trump and New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani speak to members of the media as they meet in the Oval Office at the White House in Washington, D.C., U.S., Nov. 21, 2025. Jonathan Ernst | ReutersTrump gave more praise than Mamdani returned, but the two did trade some compliments.\"I think you're going to have, hopefully, a really great mayor,\" Trump said. \"The better he does, the happier I am.\"\"I appreciated the meeting with the president,\" said Mamdani, who stood while Trump sat at the Resolute Desk. \"And as he said, it was a productive meeting focused on a place of shared admiration and love, which is New York City and the need to deliver affordability to New Yorkers.\"The conciliatory tone was brand new. Mamdani had laced into the president on the campaign trail and in his electoral victory speech, saying, \"If anyone can show a nation betrayed by Donald Trump how to defeat him, it is the city that gave rise to him.\"And just two days earlier, Trump had called Mamdani the \"Communist Mayor of New York City.\" The mayor-elect is a self-described democratic socialist who denies being a communist.The Oval Office meeting was requested by Mamdani, the 34-year-old whose stunning triumph in the mayoral race over former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo has put him at the center of American politics.\"I will work with anyone to make life more affordable for the more than eight-and-a-half million people who call the city home,\" Mamdani said Thursday.Mamdani and other Democrats who won a bevy of elections this month had focused relentlessly on affordability — a word that Trump has chafed at, while insisting that prices are broadly down already.Meanwhile, the president's approval ratings have fallen precipitously in numerous polls, with respondents consistently pointing to the high cost of living as a main concern.Subscribe to CNBC on YouTube.     ",

    "body": "Cambridge Dictionary named \"parasocial\" as Word of the Year for 2025.Francesco Carta Fotografo | Moment | Getty ImagesAI chatbots, Taylor Swift, and social media influencers all played a part in deciding Cambridge Dictionary's Word of the Year, 2025: \"parasocial.\" Parasocial — revealed by the global dictionary on Tuesday as its word of the year — refers to the connection a person feels to an online personality ranging from celebrities to podcasters, and even artificial intelligence. \"Parasocial relationship is when we think we know someone, or we feel very close to someone who's in fact, a person we've never met, like a celebrity, an influencer, or somebody in public life who's famous for some reason,\" Simone Schnall, professor of experimental social psychology at the University of Cambridge, told CNBC Make It. \"In reality, of course, it's only a one-sided, so-called relationship,\" she added. The term originated in 1956 when University of Chicago sociologists Donald Horton and Richard Wohl found that people who watched television were treating the actors on-screen like friends or family. Schnall explained that the \"phenomenon\" is well-known in our culture, but it's only now that people are using the term more commonly. \"It's been there forever, but I think in our culture, we now see parasocials on steroids, simply because there are so many opportunities for it. There are so many people who, for whatever reason, we can be interested in and fascinated by, inspired by,\" she said. One example is singer and billionaire Taylor Swift who has an intense global fanbase due to her relatable songs. Many of her fan report having a deep, emotional connection with her and keep up with her personal life and romantic relationships. Other examples include social media influencer and Youtuber Logan Paul who has around 27 million followers on Instagram and 23 million subscribers on YouTube. In 2018, Paul posted a video showing a deceased person in Japan's Aokigahara \"suicide forest,\" sparking global outrage. Many of his die‑hard fans defended him, showing fierce loyalty despite the seriousness of the content. Paul later apologized for the video. Schnall warned there are \"dangers\" in following celebrities and social media influencers who might share incorrect medical advice, sell bad products, or promote unethical behaviour.  \"They [influencers] could do some serious harm to their followers. The people who feel they're in that parasocial relationship, they could really be harmed by that,\" Schnall warned. AI chatbots and loneliness culture Cambridge Dictionary referenced that part of the increasing popularity of the word \"parasocial\" stems from relationships being formed with AI chatbots. A 2025 report by Common Sense Media, which surveyed 1,060 U.S. teens, found that 72% of teenagers aged 13 to 17 had used an AI companion at least once. This was for a range of reasons from emotional or mental health support or as a friend or best friend. \"They're called chatbots because we feel like we're chatting with someone already,\" Schnall said. \"People can develop certain relationships, like a friendship or even romantic relationship, or at least, that's how they feel about it, when of course in reality, there is no one else involved.\" And it's not just teens. A recent survey by Vantage Point Counselling of over 1,000 American adults found that 28% said they have had a romantic or intimate relationship with an AI. Schnall offered two reasons why people are turning to parasocial relationships: a global loneliness epidemic and increased screentime. On phones and screens, parasocial relationships are \"just a click away\" so it's easier to get immediate social approval. Meanwhile, chatbots are designed to flatter you, per Schnall. \"People tend to be more lonely than in previous generations, and they spend so much time on their screens where these parasocial relationships are very easy to establish,\" she said.The antidote, Schnall said is investing in real-life relationships because the more time you spend online, the less time you spend pursuing in-person connections. \"The more time I spend chatting with a chatbot, the less time I probably spent chatting with a real life person,\" she added.

    "body": "U.S. President Donald Trump delivers remarks at the McDonald's Impact Summit at the Westin Hotel in Washington, D.C., U.S., Nov. 17, 2025. Evelyn Hockstein | ReutersPresident Donald Trump on Monday said that California Gov. Gavin Newsom is \"laying siege on the minimum wage.\" Trump's comments at the McDonald's Impact Summit likely referred to California's higher hourly pay floor for fast-food workers, which took effect a year and a half ago. However, data so far indicate the policy hasn't been the danger Trump described. Research shows that the state's fast-food worker turnover is down. Widespread closures haven't occurred, and restaurant chains are still opening locations in California. To be sure, the increased wages have put more pressure on restaurant chains and operators at a time when other costs are climbing and diners are eating out less frequently. Plus, consumers are paying more for their burgers, chicken tenders and fries as a result of the new pay floor. But after a protracted fight over whether higher pay for workers would harm restaurants, critics' worst fears have not come to pass.Fast-food workers in California at chains with more than 60 national locations started earning $20 an hour in April 2024, 25% more than the state's broader minimum wage of $16 an hour. The sectoral pay floor is part of larger law passed in California that also establishes a council that will recommend proposed industry standards to state agencies and carries the authority to raise the hourly minimum wage annually. Fast-food workers' big break only came after a compromise between the restaurant industry and unions that ended months of fighting between the two parties. The Service Employees International Union championed the legislation, saying it would improve workers' lives and help with industry turnover. Quick-service restaurants argued that they were being unfairly targeted and the wage hike would burden their businesses. \"I firmly believe that everyone should be entitled to a fair wage. The issue that I and my colleagues in this industry have is that we, as an industry, were targeted,\" said Kerri Harper-Howie, who runs WEH Organization and its 25 McDonald's locations in Los Angeles County with her sister, Nicole Harper-Rawlins.. \"If someone works at Macy's and they're making minimum wage, or they work at CVS ... They also should deserve that increase in wages.\" California hasn't supported a wider minimum-wage increase. Last November, just months after the fast-food pay floor went into effect, voters in the state struck down a ballot measure that would have raised the statewide minimum wage to $18 an hour. It reportedly was the first time in nearly three decades that voters shot down a statewide minimum wage hike on any state ballot.For now, other states have yet to follow California's lead, as the nation monitors the effects of the law and the restaurant industry continues to lobby against it. A scramble for franchiseesA McDonald's worker prepares to deliver an order at a McDonald's restaurant on May 8, 2024 in San Francisco, California. Justin Sullivan | Getty ImagesBroadly, the restaurant industry struggles with razor-thin profit margins. Labor is typically the biggest cost, and operators often aim to keep it roughly 30% of their overall costs. The higher minimum wage has been yet another challenge for operators, on top of commodity inflation and weakness in consumer spending.\"What we can say without a doubt is that it's really tough to operate any restaurant, any concept, any size, in California right now,\" said Sean Kennedy, executive vice president of public affairs for the National Restaurant Association, a major trade group that opposed the wage hike. For 17 months after the higher minimum wage went into effect, Harper-Howie's WEH Organization saw its same-store sales decline. The trend finally reversed in October, as McDonald's rounded the one-year anniversary of an E. coli outbreak that sent company-wide sales plunging by double-digits overnight. The burger chain more broadly has seen its U.S. performance struggle, although it reported same-store sales growth in the third quarter.\"For a long period of time, we were just bleeding money,\" said Harper-Howie, who formed the California Alliance of Family Owned Businesses with fellow McDonald's franchisees to push back against the California legislation.Harper-Howie estimates that her restaurants passed along price increases of less than 10% to customers. Raising prices further would be difficult amid a pullback in dining across the restaurant industry, particularly from low-income consumers. Plus, she said other minimum-wage workers who frequent McDonald's didn't receive the same pay hike, which made the food \"unaffordable for many.\"Harshraj Ghai, who operates more than 200 Burger King, Taco Bell and Popeyes locations across California and Oregon, has similarly raised menu prices by roughly 10% to 12% at California locations. That wasn't enough to offset the wage increases, Ghai said.To further mitigate the higher costs, Ghai has worked to cut labor hours by testing artificial intelligence to take drive-thru orders, using pre-cooked bacon for breakfast and adding automatic batter mixers.\"The cost and maintenance of of these technologies starts to become a little bit better than it would to pay somebody to actually do it,\" he said. The wage hike was just one more rapidly increasing cost for franchisees to wrangle. For example, Harper-Howie said WEH's insurance costs have soared, on top of rising prices for beef and other key ingredients. The Los Angeles wildfires put more pressure on Harper-Howie's business. One of her locations was temporarily closed, but the bigger blow came from the shrinking traffic as fires raged across the county, displacing many residents and scaring off tourists. Trump's hardline immigration stance has been another issue. \"Our employees are predominantly Latino, and they're terrified,\" Harper-Howie said. \"That's all of our hourly workers, our general managers, our shift managers, our department managers, and supervisors — and it's our customers.\"Harper-Howie said that she hasn't had to close any restaurants yet, crediting WEH's decades in the McDonald's system after her parents joined the franchise in the 1980's.But that isn't the case for Ghai, who has had to shutter some unprofitable locations permanently. He said that he's shuttered roughly 10 California locations over the last year and half, and he anticipates shuttering another 12 over the next year or two. While closures are a typical part of a large-scale restaurant business, those closures are much steeper than normal for Ghai, he said.For comparison, Ghai operates only Taco Bell restaurants in Oregon, but those locations are \"significantly more profitable\" than those in California, he said. He hasn't had to close any of his Oregon Taco Bells, but he has closed at least three in California. Taco Bell broadly has outperformed the broader fast-food industry over the last year, helped by its value perception and strong brand equity.Meanwhile, Kennedy said some franchisors are choosing to refranchise their California restaurants, collecting franchising fees in place of the headaches of operating the locations themselves.Despite higher labor costs, California is still a desirable market for fast-food chains. The state added nearly 2,300 fast-food restaurants from the first quarter of 2024 to the first quarter of 2025, according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. That increase represents a 5% jump, faster than the rest of the country's growth of 2% and outpacing California's increase of 2% in the year-ago period, based on analysis by the California Fast Food Workers Union.A lifeline for workersAn employee hands items to a customer at the drive-thru of a Jack in the Box restaurant in Los Angeles, California, US, on Monday, April 1, 2024.Eric Thayer | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesWhile the mandated pay hike brings another challenge for restaurant operators, workers see it as a win, even if it means fewer scheduled hours.For Zane Marte, 28, the pay bump meant that he could offer more support to his family and buy some of his own groceries, rather than leaning on his parents.Marte worked for Jack in the Box in the San Jose area for seven years. When he started, he earned $12 an hour. Over time, his pay crept up, lifted by raises and eventually a promotion to a management position. Still, until the $20 fast-food wage went into effect, his hourly pay was still several dollars below the new pay floor. His experience aligns with research from the University of California Berkeley's Center on Wage and Employment Dynamics. Researchers Michael Reich and Denis Sosinskiy found that the average pre-policy wage for fast-food workers in California was $17.13 an hour, suggesting that the average hourly pay hike after the $20 minimum took effect was about 17%. A separate report from the University of Kentucky published in April found that hiring for fast-food jobs fell after the new pay floor was implemented. However, turnover shrank as the higher wages encouraged workers to stick around. That decline in turnover offset a slowdown in hiring for fast-food workers in California, according to the report.Historically, turnover has been a major problem for the fast-food industry. Hiring and training new workers is expensive and time consuming for operators. For his part, Marte left Jack in the Box months after receiving the raise after he said he grew \"fed up\" with his manager. He has since left California and found employment using his college degree.Before the higher minimum wage went into effect, one concern from operators and trade groups was that other restaurants not included in the policy would have to raise their own wages to stay competitive — which critics said could be particularly hard for small businesses. But that fear largely doesn't seem to have been realized.The Berkeley study did not find any evidence of a spillover into the wages of workers at full-service restaurants chains such as Denny's, Applebee's, Buffalo Wild Wings, Red Robin and Outback Steakhouse. And more broadly, the researchers from the University of Kentucky did not find evidence that other non-food, low-wage employers raised their pay. The slowdown in fast-food hiring meant that other employers didn't have to worry much about their workers leaving for those jobs. Research from the Shift Project, a partnership between Harvard and the University of California San Francisco, found that the wage hike did not result in employers cutting scheduled hours or lead to understaffing in the immediate aftermath of the policy. Anecdotally, however, some fast-food restaurants have cut back their hours. For example, Julia Gonzalez, 21, lives in Los Angeles and works at Pizza Hut and Yoshinoya, a Japanese fast-food chain with roughly 100 locations in California. She told CNBC that she's been scheduled for fewer hours, but the increased wages still mean that she's able to save more money. (Gonzalez is affiliated with the California Fast Food Workers Union, which was a proponent of the industry's higher minimum wage.)Harper-Howie also told CNBC that her restaurants cut the number of overall labor hours because of slumping sales, as higher menu prices scared away diners.Meanwhile, the number of fast-food job losses caused by the policy is still hotly debated.Analysis of BLS data by the Employment Policies Institute, which opposes minimum wage hikes, found that roughly 16,000 fast-food jobs in California have been eliminated since Newsom signed the law in September 2024. However, Reich and Sosinskiy reported no related job losses using employment data that was adjusted to remove seasonal fluctuations, citing California's more temperate climate than the rest of the country.For his part, Newsom, widely believed to be a frontrunner for the 2028 presidential election, still includes it in lists of his policy wins as California governor.\"After raising the minimum wage for workers, California now has 750,500 fast food jobs — the MOST in state history! California's fast food industry continues to boom every single month with workers finally receiving the wages they deserve,\" he wrote in a post on X in August last year.",

    "description": "watch nowParamount Skydance, Comcast and Netflix formally submitted takeover offers for Warner Bros. Discovery this week ahead of a deadline for first",
    "body": "watch nowParamount Skydance, Comcast and Netflix formally submitted takeover offers for Warner Bros. Discovery this week ahead of a deadline for first-round offers, according to people familiar with the matter. Comcast, the parent company of NBCUniversal, bid solely for the film and streaming assets, which consists of the Warner Bros. studio and HBO Max, the people said. The offer would see NBCUniversal become the parent of the WBD assets, one of the people said, and would not involve a spinout of NBCUniversal as some in the industry had speculated. Comcast is currently in the process of spinning out its portfolio of cable networks, which includes CNBC, but will retain NBCUniversal. As of January, that business unit will consist only of the broadcast network NBC, streaming service Peacock, Universal film studio and theme parks. Comcast's offer included a clause that would allow WBD to spin out its own cable networks, including CNN and TNT Sports, at any point before the proposed acquisition closes, the person said. Comcast President and soon-to-be co-CEO Mike Cavanagh recently telegraphed in an earnings call that an acquisition of studio and streaming assets would be complementary to NBCUniversal. Cavanagh also said the company believes a deal would be \"viable\" in the context of the current regulatory environment. Like Comcast, Netflix, also bid solely for the film and streaming assets, according to the people familiar. Meanwhile, Paramount Skydance once again submitted, its fourth to date. In recent days, Paramount Skydance and its advisors had been weighing whether to submit a higher bid than its previous $23.50-per-share offer that WBD rejected, some of the people said. Netflix's offer was expected to be \"disciplined\" with its bid, one of the people said. Details on the size of all three offers weren't immediately clear. Warner Bros. Discovery alerted the bidders that it had received the offers and would be back in touch with them soon, one of the people said. Representatives for Warner Bros. Discovery, Paramount, Netflix and Comcast declined to comment. Warner Bros. Discovery is aiming to have its sale process wrapped up by mid- to late-December, CNBC previously reported. Another round of bids is expected to occur in the coming weeks, some of the people said. Last month Warner Bros. Discovery said it was expanding a strategic review of its business to include a potential sale — even as it carries on with a plan to split into two separate entities: Warner Bros., made up of the film studio and streaming platform, and Discovery Global, which would include the company's pay TV networks. While Warner Bros. Discovery's split has been underway, takeover interest from the newly merged Paramount Skydance led WBD CEO David Zaslav and top brass to open up to a formal sale process. If an offer for the studio and streaming assets were to be successful, Discovery Global would move forward with its spinout and current WBD CFO Gunnar Wiedenfels would become CEO. The Warner Bros. logo is displayed on a water tower at Warner Bros. Studio on September 12, 2025 in Burbank, California. Mario Tama | Getty ImagesParamount has already sent multiple letters to WBD's board explaining why its offer of $23.50 per share for all of WBD's assets is in the best interest of shareholders and the company itself. WBD's stock gained 1% Friday to close at $23.19 per share. The company's share price has increased more than 20% since announcing it was up for sale in October. Paramount CEO David Ellison recently met with Saudi-backed sovereign funds about financing a potential transaction, although the conversations were only preliminary and Ellison and his father, Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison, are prepared to fully finance a transaction, people familiar with the matter said. While Paramount is interested in a deal for the entirety of WBD, the formal sale process has opened up the possibility of a buyer for only part of the legacy media company. — CNBC's David Faber contributed to this report.

    "body": "Three years since the arrival of OpenAI's ChatGPT, more devices featuring generative AI technology have hit the market in time for the 2025 holiday shopping season, with many offering deals for Black Friday.Shoppers can pick from more advanced smart glasses, smart speakers with genAI and a pendant AI friend that acts as a confidant.These latest gizmos come from megacaps like Amazon, Alphabet and Meta and smaller players like Friend and Plaud.Despite the arrival of this new wave of products, reviews for many of the devices are mixed, and nothing has separated itself as a clear leader of the pack.That's in part because much of the spending on artificial intelligence has been focused on other things.Since ChatGPT was released in late 2022, the bulk of the tech industry has reoriented itself to prioritize building out large language models in a race to reach artificial general intelligence, or AI with the capabilities that are on par with, or surpass, humans.Thus far, much of the development in Silicon Valley has focused on AI apps, including chatbots like Anthropic's Claude, image generators like Google's Nano Banana or feeds for AI-generated short-form videos like OpenAI's Sora. All things people can access on their existing smartphones without a spiffy new gadget.But the world of AI hardware is growing fast.If you're in the market for the latest AI devices, here's what's available to snag this holiday season.Daniel Rausch, vice president of Alexa and Echo, announces the Echo Studio and Echo Dot Max during an Amazon event showcasing new products in New York City, U.S., September 30, 2025.Kylie Cooper | ReutersAlexa+ Echo speakersAmazon wants to make sure its Alexa voice assistant and Echo smart speakers don't get left behind in the era of genAI. The company unveiled Alexa+ in February, promising a smarter, more conversational and personalized version of its 11-year-old digital assistant. In September, it followed up with a new set of Echo speakers and displays, which are the first devices to come with Alexa+ out of the box. The lineup includes a $100 Echo Dot Max, $180 Echo Show, $220 Echo Studio and $220 Echo Show 11.The Echo Dot Max is an entry-level, all-purpose smart speaker, while the Echo Studio is larger, pricier and offers better sound quality. The main difference between Amazon's smart displays, the Echo Show 8 and Echo Show 11, is the touchscreen size.  All of the devices have improved sensors, speakers and microphones. Amazon is offering 11% off the cost of the Echo Show 11 and 10% off the Echo Dot Max as part of its Black Friday promotions.With the upgrades, Amazon is aiming to have users engage more often with the devices than their predecessors. Consumers frequently complained that Alexa had grown outdated while the Echo devices offered little utility beyond setting timers, spouting weather forecasts, playing music and controlling smart home accessories, like turning lights on and off. Amazon's recent Alexa ad tries to paint a different picture. Comedian Pete Davidson strolls through his kitchen when an Alexa-equipped Echo Show announces, unprompted, that the \"Coffee's on, and your Uber is on its way.\" Davidson then casually banters back and forth with Alexa about his preferred nickname. The interaction is meant to showcase a few of Alexa+'s biggest selling points — users don't have to repeat a so-called \"wake word\" after every command, allowing the conversation to flow more naturally.The devices can also now connect to external services to take actions on users' behalf. As of now, Alexa+ can book an Uber or OpenTable reservation, generate a song via Suno, plan a trip through Fodor's, schedule a repairman visit and purchase concert tickets through Ticketmaster. Amazon has said it expects to add more capabilities soon.Alexa+ isn't yet available to the general public. Consumers have to wait to receive Early Access or purchase a new Echo model to use it. Amazon is offering Alexa+ for free to users with Early Access, but at some point, the company will begin charging non-Prime members $19.99 a month for the service.The company is also making moves in wearables.Amazon in July announced plans to acquire AI company Bee for an undisclosed amount, indicating that it could have more hardware infused with the technology in the works. Bee is known for its $50 wristband that uses AI and microphones to listen to and analyze conversations, then provide to-do lists, summaries and reminders for everyday tasks.-- Annie PalmerA person holds Google Pixel 10, Pixel 10 Pro and Pixel 10 Pro Fold mobile phones during the 'Made by Google' event, organised to introduce the latest additions to Google's Pixel portfolio of devices, in Brooklyn, New York, U.S., August 20, 2025. Brendan McDermid | ReutersGoogle's AI-powered Pixel 10 seriesAlthough the Gemini-powered Google Home Speaker won't roll out until the spring, Alphabet did deliver some generative AI tech this year.Launched in August, the Pixel 10 smartphones thoroughly integrate Google's AI into several features, such as live translation, text-based photo editing and the built-in Gemini assistant.The baseline Pixel 10 starts at $799, while the Pro lineup includes the $999 Pixel 10 Pro, the $1,199 Pixel Pro XL and the $1,799 Pixel 10 Pro Fold. The Pro line offers a higher quality camera and display, as well as additional video features.Among the AI products is \"Magic Cue,\" which connects data across different apps to surface relevant information and suggest helpful actions. For example, if a user receives a message asking about a dinner reservation's location, Magic Cue can find the answer from the calendar app.For snapping pictures, Google provides an AI \"Camera Coach,\" which scans the scene of a photo and offers recommendations about framing, lighting and other techniques to improve the image.The Pixel 10 Pro phones come with a one-year subscription to Google's \"AI Pro\" plan, which typically costs $19 per month and offers multiple AI tools, including writing assistant NotebookLM and video generator Veo 3.All the Pixel 10 models are currently on sale for $200 to $300 off until Dec. 6, except for the Pixel 10 Pro Fold, which has a $300 markdown until Dec. 2, the company said.-- Jaures YipThe Meta Ray-Ban Display AI glasses at Meta headquarters in Menlo Park, California, US, on Tuesday, Sept. 16, 2025. David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesMeta's AI-infused Ray-Ban smart glassesMeta's partnership with eyewear giant EssilorLuxottica, originally inked in 2019, has spawned a surprise hit in the Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses that both companies are keen to boast about.With the Meta AI digital assistant, users can command the camera-equipped glasses to take photos, play tunes and to answer questions about nearby landmarks.In September, the two companies debuted the latest version of the glasses, dubbed Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2). The new model has double the battery life of its predecessor and an improved camera. It costs $379, which is $80 than the prior version.Meta and Luxottica this year also launched two smart glasses aimed at athletes under the Oakley brand.The $399 Oakley Meta HSTN glasses are pitched toward casual athletes who want to take photos while playing sports like golf, while the $499 Oakley Meta Vanguard smart glasses are geared toward the action-sports crowd, like skiers. The Vanguard glasses feature a flashier wraparound design and two buttons on the frames' underside that lets helmet-wearing athletes easily take photos and videos and perform other actions.For those willing to spend big money and test new technology, Meta and Luxottica also rolled out the $799 Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses in September. They are the first glasses Meta sells to the public that include a display, albeit a small one, in just one of the lenses. The display is intended to show users small bits of information, like navigation directions. The glasses also include a wristband that utilizes neural technology so users can command the device with gestures like rotating one's fingers to adjust volume.Buying the $799 glasses, though, is not easy. Meta requires that people sign-up for in-person demos at stores like Best Buy and LensCrafters before buying the product, and the company warns that \"availability varies by store, so you may not be able to purchase a pair immediately after your demo.\"Early reviews for the display glasses have been mixed. Some reviewers have praised the device's color display, camera and innovative wristband. Still, others have criticized its high price and have said its lack of apps limit functionality.Meta is currently offering a few Black Friday and Cyber Monday deals for some of its various AI-powered smart glasses that will last until Dec. 1.People can save 20% on all versions of the Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 1) at Best Buy, Target, Amazon and also at Meta's website and the Ray-Ban website and stores. Meta is also offering 20% off the cost of prescription lenses for people who buy the Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2) and Oakley Meta HSTN glasses from its website.-- Jonathan VanianFriend AI PendantSource: FriendThe AI friend you wear around as a pendantMost AI chatbots want to make the user more productive. The makers of this smart pendant want AI to be your friend.Users wear Friend, as the product is aptly called, around their necks while the $129 device listens to the conversations happening around it.Friend's chatbot is powered by Google Gemini, and it offers commentary on the user's conversation and life. Those comments appear as notifications through the device's corresponding smartphone app. For example, when one reviewer played a new Taylor Swift song for her AI friend, the device commented through a notification that it didn't \"think it's bad at all\" and \"pretty typical for pop.\"The device is at the center of the societal debate about the rise of AI.Friend plastered a subway station in New York this fall with ads that suggested that the pendant was better than a real friend, promising that it \"will never bail on our dinner plans.\" The posters were immediately defaced with messages like \"AI wouldn't care if you lived or died.\"Those wanting to experience what it's like to wear around an AI friend should place orders swiftly. The company's website currently says units will be shipping \"Winter 2025/26,\" but Friend founder Avi Schiffmann told CNBC that devices ordered early enough will ship before Christmas.  -- Kif LeswingPlaud NoteSource: PlaudPlaud, the AI recorderThe Plaud Note looks more like a credit card than a voice recorder, but it's an ideal purchase for any note taker who wants to capture meetings, lectures or any dictation.With over 30 hours of recording time and battery that last 60 days on standby, the slim device can produce transcriptions in 112 languages. The transcriptions include tags for each speaker on the audio.The recorder's companion app is powered by OpenAI's GPT-5, Anthropic's Claude Sonnet 4 and Google's Gemini 2.5 Pro. The app uses those AI models to generate detailed summaries and notes. Users can select from over 3,000 summary templates, such as phone Q&As or seminar notes.The Plaud App's basic plan offers 300 minutes of transcription per month, though users can upgrade to a pro plan for 1,200 minutes for $8.33 per month or a more expensive unlimited plan for $19.99 per month.The recorder can easily be attached to phones with MagSafe magnets, meaning all Apple smartphones since the iPhone 12 series, or phone cases with similar magnets.The company also offers the Plaud NotePin, a smaller, pill-shaped version of the recorder that can be worn as a magnetic pin, clip, wristband or necklace.Typically priced at $159, both devices are currently on sale for 20% off during Black Friday and Cyber Monday, with another 15% markdown set for Christmas, the company said.-- Jaures YipWATCH: Google releases Gemini 3.0 model, closes gap on ChatGPTwatch now",

    "body": "Daniel Gray and his husband, Douglas, and their dog.Courtesy: Daniel GrayOn Oct. 23, the day after Daniel Gray's 56th birthday, he received an email that made him feel like he was dreaming: The U.S. Department of Education would forgive his more than $170,000 student loan balance.\"I could not believe it,\" Gray said. \"This is the first time I've been without debt since I'm 18.\"Yet the relief should not have been so surprising. Gray began paying his student loan debt in the 1990s and was eligible for the loan cancellation under the terms of his income-driven repayment plan. IDR plans lead to loan erasure after a certain period, typically 20 years or 25 years. But, like many borrowers, Gray was worried by reports that the relief was becoming harder to access under the Trump administration. \"Because of what's been going on, it was unclear whether they'd get forgiven,\" Gray said. Recently, many student loan borrowers have been left doubting if they'll get the loan cancellation to which they're entitled, said higher education expert Mark Kantrowitz. \"When borrowers worry about whether the Trump administration will renege on the student loan forgiveness promised by the federal government, it places them under extreme financial and emotional stress,\" Kantrowitz said. The U.S. Department of Education did not respond to a request for comment. Loan forgiveness becomes uncertain under Trump Earlier this year, the Education Department stopped forgiving the debt of borrowers in two long-standing student loan repayment plans, the Income-Contingent Repayment plan, or ICR, and the Pay As You Earn plan, or PAYE. It also temporarily paused debt forgiveness under the Income-Based Repayment plan, or IBR. More than 12 million student loan borrowers are enrolled in one of the Education Department's IDR plans, according to Kantrowitz.  But then, in October, there was a major victory for borrowers: The Trump administration agreed to resume clearing people's debts under ICR and PAYE, as a result of a lawsuit brought by the American Federation of Teachers. That same month, eligible borrowers enrolled in IBR also began to see their debts canceled again. The AFT contended that Trump officials were blocking borrowers from their rights mandated in their loan terms. \"We cannot say for sure, but it is possible that the AFT lawsuit prompted the discharge,\" said Weena Sanchez, a student loan counselor at the Education Debt Consumer Assistance Program in New York, a nonprofit, about Gray's student loan forgiveness. EDCAP worked with Gray on his request for the relief. Gray had earned the loan cancellation by May 2024, according to his loan forgiveness statement. \"We've heard of other clients receiving similar notices,\" Sanchez said.

The Trump administration announced this week that it will transfer much of the Education Department's programs to other agencies, a move experts say is part of President Donald Trump's directive to dismantle the agency. Education Department officials are also exploring options to sell portions of the $1.6 trillion federal student portfolio to the private market, Politico reported in October.A lifetime vow of poverty should not be part of the bargain. Mark Kantrowitz higher education expert Whatever changes lie ahead, it's important for borrowers to remember that the original terms of their student loans, spelled out in their Master Promissory Note, cannot change in the middle of repayment, Kantrowitz said. When borrowers signed that agreement, any programs that were in existence at the time, including repayment plans that conclude in loan forgiveness, must remain available to them, by law.Since student loans can't be discharged in normal bankruptcy proceedings, like other types of debt, borrowers \"depend on there being a light at the end of the tunnel,\" with the government's forgiveness, Kantrowitz said.\"When a low-income student is forced to borrow to pay for college, a lifetime vow of poverty should not be part of the bargain,\" he said. Student loan forgiveness 'the only way out' For some 30 years, Gray says his student loan debt weighed on him. He graduated in the mid-1990s from the University of California, Santa Barbara, with a degree in film studies and began working technical jobs in video and television production. But in the following years, he says, he grappled with substance abuse issues and clinical depression. As a result, his career took a hit, and Gray struggled to keep up with his monthly student loan payment, he said. Originally, he borrowed roughly around $30,000, but his balance steadily grew due to interest charges. \"This system is designed for students to graduate, get good jobs and start paying,\" Gray said. \"But what about for those of us who don't get our lives together until we are 37 or 38?\" By then, he said, his debt was already nearing six figures. By the time his debt was canceled by the government in October, his balance had spiraled to more than $170,000. \"I couldn't believe I had allowed it to get to this point; I felt incredibly guilty and ashamed,\" Gray said, but he also \"felt like the whole situation was engineered to take advantage of the borrower.\"  In 2011, Gray got a job offer at a television studio in Brazil. Frustrated with the cost of living in the U.S. and hoping for a major change, he made the move to São Paulo. He's lived in Brazil ever since. He met his now-husband, Douglas, a chef, there. The couple live close to the beach and take their dog for long walks every day.The biggest change Gray has felt since his student debt was wiped away is psychological: \"I suddenly feel like I can relax,\" he said. \"It's easy for people to say, 'Why don't people just pay them off? What's the big deal?\" Gray said, about his student loans. But he went on: \"It reached a point where it was beyond control. It seemed impossible. Student loan forgiveness is the only way out for a lot of people.\"",

Every member of the Magnificent 7, except for Alphabet, posted a losing week, with Nvidia, Amazon and Microsoft staring down the biggest losses. Amazon and Microsoft led the group's drop lower, falling 6% and 7% this week, respectively. Meanwhile, Alphabet gained 8%. The search giant is also the only megacap of the group on pace for November gains thanks to a boost from the launch of Gemini 3.Oracle, which is another major Nvidia customer, slumped about 11%.

Quantum computing stocks  IonQ and D-Wave fell more than 11% and 13%, respectively.CoreWeave, which buys and rents out Nvidia's chips in data centers, initially soared on the chipmaker's earnings report, but swiftly reversed course. The company's stock took a 7% blow this week.AI fever was cooling in the runup to Nvidia's earnings report on Wednesday, and investors looked to the print to alleviate fears that the AI bubble was on shaky ground. Since the launch of ChatGPT in late 2022, the stock has helped power the market to new all-time highs. But concerns have mounted in recent weeks as tech stocks hit stretched valuations. Major investors, including Bridgewater's Ray Dalio told CNBC Thursday that the market is definitely in a bubble. Much of the worries have stemmed from a boom in capital expenditures spending to support AI, with few signs of a payoff in view for many of the players. Investor Michael Burry recently accused some of the biggest cloud and infrastructure providers of understating depreciation expenses and estimating a longer life cycle for their chips, calling it \"one of the more common frauds of the modern era.\" Earlier this month, Burry revealed bets against Nvidia and Palantir.Shares of the software analytics company, which supplies AI tools to the government and businesses, plunged 11% this week. The stock has shed nearly a quarter of its value this month. WATCH: Bridgewater founder Ray Dalio: We are definitely in a bubble, but that doesn't mean you should sellwatch now",

    "body": "watch nowAmazon's 14,000-plus layoffs announced last month touched almost every piece of the company's sprawling business, from cloud computing and devices to advertising, retail and grocery stores. But one job category bore the brunt of cuts more than others: engineers. Documents filed in New York, California, New Jersey and Amazon's home state of Washington showed that nearly 40% of the more than 4,700 job cuts in those states were engineering roles. The data was reported by Amazon in Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification, or WARN, filings to state agencies.The figures represent a segment of the total layoffs announced in October. Not all data was immediately available because of differences in state WARN reporting requirements.In announcing the steepest round of cuts in its 31-year history, Amazon joined a growing roster of tech companies that have slashed jobs this year even as cash piles have mounted and profits soared. In total, there have been almost 113,000 job cuts at 231 tech companies, according to Layoffs.fyi, continuing a trend that began in 2022 as businesses readjusted to life after the Covid pandemic. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy has been on a multiyear mission to transform the company's corporate culture into one that operates like what he calls \"the world's largest startup.\" He's looked to make Amazon leaner and less bureaucratic by urging staffers to do more with less and cutting organizational bloat.Amazon is expected to carry out further job reductions in January, CNBC previously reported. Andy Jassy, chief executive officer of Amazon.com Inc., speaks during an unveiling event in New York, US, on Wednesday, Feb. 26, 2025.

The technology is already poised to reshape Amazon's white-collar workforce, with Jassy predicting in June that its corporate head count will shrink in the coming years alongside efficiency gains from AI. Human resources chief Beth Galetti, in her memo announcing the layoffs, focused on the importance of innovating, which the company will now have to do with fewer people, specifically engineers. \"This generation of AI is the most transformative technology we've seen since the Internet, and it's enabling companies to innovate much faster than ever before,\" Galetti wrote. \"We're convinced that we need to be organized more leanly, with fewer layers and more ownership, to move as quickly as possible for our customers and business.\"Amazon said in a statement that AI is not the driver behind the vast majority of the job cuts, and that the bigger goal was to reduce bureaucracy and emphasize speed.Jassy said on Amazon's earnings call last month that the cuts were in response to a \"culture\" issue inside the company, spurred in part by an extended hiring spree that left it with \"a lot more layers\" and slower decision-making.The layoffs impacted a mix of software engineer levels, but SDE II roles, or mid-level employees, were disproportionately affected, the WARN filings show. The AI boom is making software development jobs harder to come by as companies adopt coding assistants or so-called vibe coding platforms from vendors like Cursor, OpenAI and Cognition. Amazon has released its own competitor called Kiro.Read more CNBC tech newsNvidia is king in AI chips, but Google and Amazon want to catch up by making their ownGoogle must double AI compute every 6 months to meet demand, AI infrastructure boss tells employeesFeds charge 4 in plot to export restricted Nvidia chips to China, Hong KongJoby lawsuit accuses air taxi rival Archer of using stolen information to ‘one-up’ deal'Significant role reductions'More than 500 product managers and program managers were eliminated as part of the layoffs, based on records from the states with WARN notices, representing more than 10% of the total. Senior manager and principal level roles were also swept up in the cuts, the filings show. As part of the broader belt-tightening, Amazon has sought in recent years to curtail investments in some of the company's more experimental or unprofitable initiatives. It sunset a telehealth service, kids video calling device, fitness wearable and several brick-and-mortar retail chains. Amazon's video game division was targeted in the company's latest layoff wave, California WARN filings show. Steve Boom, vice president of Audio, Twitch and Games, told staffers in a memo viewed by CNBC that \"significant role reductions\" would occur in its San Diego and Irvine, California, game studios, as well as within its central publishing team. watch nowGame designers, artists and producers made up more than a quarter of the total cuts in Irvine, and they were roughly 11% of staffers laid off at Amazon's San Diego offices, according to filings.The company also told staffers it's halting much of its work on big-budget, or triple A, game development, specifically around massively multiplayer online, or MMO, games, Boom wrote. Amazon has released MMOs including Crucible and New World. It was also developing an MMO based on \"Lord of the Rings.\"Beyond its gaming division, Amazon also significantly cut back its visual search and shopping teams, according to multiple employee posts on LinkedIn. The unit is responsible for products like Amazon Lens and Lens Live, AI shopping tools that enable users to find products via their camera in real time or images saved to their device. The company rolled out Lens Live in September.The team was primarily based in Palo Alto, California, and Amazon's WARN filings indicate that software engineers, applied scientists and quality assurance engineers were heavily impacted across its offices there.Amazon's online ad business, one of its biggest profit centers, was downsized as well. More than 140 ad sales and marketing roles were eliminated across Amazon's New York offices, accounting for about 20% of the roughly 760 positions cut, according to state documents viewed by CNBC.

    "body": "watch nowNvidia outperformed all expectations, reporting soaring profits Wednesday thanks to its graphics processing units that excel at AI workloads. But more categories of AI chips are gaining ground. Custom ASICs, or application-specific integrated circuits, are now being designed by all the major hyperscalers, from Google's TPU to Amazon's Trainium and OpenAI's plans with Broadcom. These chips are smaller, cheaper, accessible and could reduce these companies' reliance on Nvidia GPUs. Daniel Newman of the Futurum Group told CNBC that he sees custom ASICs \"growing even faster than the GPU market over the next few years.\"Besides GPUs and ASICs, there are also field-programmable gate arrays, which can be reconfigured with software after they're made for use in all sorts of applications, like signal processing, networking and AI. There's also an entire group of AI chips that power AI on devices rather than in the cloud. Qualcomm, Apple and others have championed those on-device AI chips. CNBC talked to experts and insiders at the Big Tech companies to break down the crowded space and the various kinds of AI chips out there. GPUs for general computeOnce used primarily for gaming, GPUs made Nvidia the world's most valuable public company after their use shifted toward AI workloads. Nvidia shipped some 6 million current-generation Blackwell GPUs over the past year.Nvidia senior director of AI infrastructure Dion Harris shows CNBC's Katie Tarasov how 72 Blackwell GPUs work together as one in a GB200 NVL72 rack-scale server system for AI at Nvidia headquarters in Santa Clara, California, on November 12, 2025.Marc GanleyThe shift from gaming to AI started around 2012, when Nvidia's GPUs were used by researchers to build AlexNet, what many consider to be modern AI's big bang moment. AlexNet was a tool that was entered into a prominent image recognition contest. Whereas others in the contest used central processing units for their applications, AlexNet reliance on GPUs provided incredible accuracy and obliterated its competition. AlexNet's creators discovered that the same parallel processing that helps GPUs render lifelike graphics was also great for training neural networks, in which a computer learns from data rather than relying on a programmer's code. AlexNet showcased the potential of GPUs. Today, GPUs are often paired with CPUs and sold in server rack systems to be placed in data centers, where they run AI workloads in the cloud. CPUs have a small number of powerful cores running sequential general-purpose tasks, while GPUs have thousands of smaller cores more narrowly focused on parallel math like matrix multiplication. Because GPUs can perform many operations simultaneously, they're ideal for the two main phases of AI computation: training and inference. Training teaches the AI model to learn from patterns in large amounts of data, while inference uses the AI to make decisions based on new information.GPUs are the general-purpose workhorses of Nvidia and its top competitor, Advanced Micro Devices. Software is a major differentiator between the two GPU leaders. While Nvidia GPUs are tightly optimized around CUDA, Nvidia's proprietary software platform, AMD GPUs use a largely open-source software ecosystem.AMD and Nvidia sell their GPUs to cloud providers like Amazon, Microsoft, Google, Oracle and CoreWeave. Those companies then rent the GPUs to AI companies by the hour or minute. Anthropic's $30 billion deal with Nvidia and Microsoft, for example, includes 1 gigawatt of compute capacity on Nvidia GPUs. AMD has also recently landed big commitments from OpenAI and Oracle.Nvidia also sells directly to AI companies, like a recent deal to sell at least 4 million GPUs to OpenAI, and to foreign governments, including South Korea, Saudi Arabia and the U.K.The chipmaker told CNBC that it charges around $3 million for one of its server racks with 72 Blackwell GPUs acting as one, and ships about 1,000 each week. Dion Harris, Nvidia's senior director of AI infrastructure, told CNBC he couldn't have imagined this much demand when he joined Nvidia over eight years ago. \"When we were talking to people about building a system that had eight GPUs, they thought that was overkill,\" he said.ASICs for custom cloud AITraining on GPUs has been key in the early boom days of large language models, but inference is becoming more crucial as the models mature. Inference can happen on less powerful chips that are programmed for more specific tasks. That's where ASICs come in. While a GPU is like a Swiss Army Knife able to do many kinds of parallel math for different AI workloads, an ASIC is like a single-purpose tool. It's very efficient and fast, but hard-wired to do the exact math for one type of job.Google released its 7th generation TPU, Ironwood, in November 2025, a decade after making its first custom ASIC for AI in 2015.Google\"You can't change them once they're already carved into silicon, and so there's a trade off in terms of flexibility,\" said Chris Miller, author of \"Chip War.\"Nvidia's GPUs are flexible enough for adoption by many AI companies, but they cost up to $40,000 and can be hard to get. Still, startups rely on GPUs because designing a custom ASIC has an even higher up-front cost, starting at tens of millions of dollars, according to Miller.For the biggest cloud providers who can afford them, analysts say custom ASICs pay off in the long-run.\"They want to have a little bit more control over the workloads that they build,\" Newsom said. \"At the same time, they're going to continue to work very closely with Nvidia, with AMD, because they also need the capacity. The demand is so insatiable.\"Google was the first Big Tech company to make a custom ASIC for AI acceleration, coining the term Tensor Processing Unit when its first ASIC came out in 2015. Google said it considered making a TPU as far back as 2006, but the situation became \"urgent\" in 2013 as it realized AI was going to double its number of data centers. In 2017, the TPU also contributed to Google's invention of the Transformer, the architecture powering almost all modern AI.A decade after its first TPU, Google released its seventh generation TPU in November. Anthropic announced it will train its LLM Claude on up to 1 million TPUs. Some people think TPUs are technically on par or superior to Nvidia's GPUs, Miller said. \"Traditionally, Google has only used them for in-house purposes,\" Miller said. \"There's a lot of speculation that in the longer run, Google might open up access to TPUs more broadly.\"Amazon Web Services was the next cloud provider to design its own AI chips, after acquiring Israeli chip startup Annapurna labs in 2015. AWS announced Inferentia in 2018, and it launched Trainium in 2022. AWS is expected to announce Trainium's third generation as soon December. Ron Diamant, Trainium's head architect, told CNBC that Amazon's ASIC has 30% to 40% better price performance compared to other hardware vendors in AWS. \"Over time, we've seen that Trainium chips can serve both inference and training workloads quite well,\" Diamant said. CNBC's Katie Tarasov holds Amazon Web Services' Trainium 2 AI chip that fill its new AI data center in New Carlisle, Indiana, on October 8, 2025.Erin BlackIn October, CNBC went to Indiana for the first on-camera tour of Amazon's biggest AI data center, where Anthropic is training its models on half a million Trainium2 chips. AWS fills its other data centers with Nvidia GPUs to meet the demand from AI customers like OpenAI.Building ASICs isn't easy. This is why companies turn to chip designers Broadcom and Marvell. They \"provide the IP and the know-how and the networking\" to help their clients build their ASICs, Miller said.\"So you've seen Broadcom in particular be one of the biggest beneficiaries of the AI boom,\" Miller said. Broadcom helped build Google's TPUs and Meta's Training and Inference Accelerator launched in 2023, and has a new deal to help OpenAI build its own custom ASICs starting in 2026.Microsoft is also getting into the ASIC game, telling CNBC that its in-house Maia 100 chips are currently deployed in its data centers in the eastern U.S. Others include Qualcomm with the A1200, Intel with its  Gaudi AI accelerators and Tesla with its AI5 chip. There's also a slew of start-ups going all in on custom AI chips, including Cerebras, which makes huge full-wafer AI chips, and Groq, with inference-focused language processing units.In China, Huawei, ByteDance, and Alibaba are making custom ASICs, although export controls on the most advanced equipment and AI chips pose a challenge.Edge AI with NPUs and FPGAsThe final big category of AI chips are those made to run on devices, rather than in the cloud. These chips are typically built into a device's main System on a Chip, SoC. Edge AI chips, as they're called, enable devices to have AI capabilities while helping them save battery life and space for other components.\"You'll be able to do that right on your phone with very low latency, so you don't have to have communication all the way back to a data center,\" said Saif Khan, former White House AI and semiconductor policy advisor. \"And you can preserve privacy of your data on your phone.\"Neural processing units are a major type of edge AI chip. Qualcomm, Intel and AMD are making NPUs that enable AI capabilities in personal computers. Although Apple doesn't use the term NPU, the in-house M-series chips inside its MacBooks include a dedicated neural engine. Apple also built neural accelerators into the latest iPhone A-series chips.\"It is efficient for us. It is responsive. We know that we are much more in control over the experience,\" Tim Millet, Apple platform architecture vice president, told CNBC in an exclusive September interview. The latest Android phones also have NPUs built into their primary Qualcomm Snapdragon chips, and Samsung has its own NPU on its Galaxy phones, too. NPUs by companies like NXP and Nvidia power AI embedded in cars, robots, cameras, smart home devices and more.\"Most of the dollars are going towards the data center, but over time that's going to change because we'll have AI deployed in our phones and our cars and wearables, all sorts of other applications to a much greater degree than today,\" Miller said.Then there's field-programmable gate arrays, or FPGAs, which can be reconfigured with software after they're made. Although far more flexible than NPUs or ASICs, FPGAs have lower raw performance and lower energy efficiency for AI workloads.AMD became the largest FPGA maker after acquiring Xilinx for $49 billion in 2022, with Intel in second thanks to its $16.7 billion purchase of Altera in 2015.These players designing AI chips rely on a single company to manufacture them all: Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company. TSMC has a giant new chip fabrication plant in Arizona, where Apple has committed to moving some chip production. In October, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said Blackwell GPUs were in \"full production\" in Arizona, too. Although the AI chip space is crowded, dethroning Nvidia won't come easily.\"They have that position because they've earned it and they've spent the years building it,\" Newman said. \"They've won that developer ecosystem.\"Watch the video to see a breakdown of how all the AI chips work: https://www.cnbc.com/video/2025/11/21/nvidia-gpus-google-tpus-aws-trainium-comparing-the-top-ai-chips.html  ",

He highlighted reports from retailers including Burlington Stores, Best Buy and Kohl's, as well as tech giant Dell.\"Every data point, every bit of research and earnings will be scrutinized starting Monday, just like a regular week, even as we'll be eating turkey and then relaxing, with everyone watching the Philadelphia Eagles play the Bears at home on Amazon,\" he said.Zoom is set to report earnings on Monday. While Cramer said he likes the company, he noted that it faces competition from Microsoft's Teams and said he wishes Zoom would buy another company to complement its video conferencing business. But he maintained that he expects a decent quarter from Zoom. Tuesday brings retail sales figures and pending home sales data. Cramer said he expects both reports to be soft, especially after hearing mixed earnings results from some major retailers over the past few days. He also noted that there has not been a lot of housing turnover. However, Cramer suggested weaker data is positive for Wall Street because it paves the way for the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates.A slew of retailers will report Tuesday, including Kohl's, Best Buy, Burlington Stores, Dick's Sporting Goods and Abercrombie & Fitch. Cramer indicated Kohl's and Best Buy would be fine, while Dick's Sporting Goods could be great since the company just acquired Foot Locker and now has access to a number of popular sneaker brands. He suggested Burlington is the weakest of its off-brand retail peers, TJX and Ross Stores, while Abercrombie & Fitch's quarter is a \"a total crapshoot.\"Dell, HP, Zscaler and Analog Devices are also expected to release quarterly reports on Tuesday. Cramer was optimistic about Dell's earnings and expressed confidence in management, but he was not as positive about peer HP. Cramer praised cybersecurity name Zscaler but worried about semiconductor maker Analog Devices.Deere will report Wednesday, and Cramer suggested the farming equipment company has a \"stock that seems like it's made of Teflon.\" While farming can be a tough business, he explained that it benefits from government subsidies, and farmers often spend that money on Deere's products. watch nowSign up now for the CNBC Investing Club to follow Jim Cramer's every move in the market.Disclaimer The CNBC Investing Club holds shares of Microsoft and TJX.Questions for Cramer?

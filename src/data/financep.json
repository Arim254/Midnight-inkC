    "body": "Senator Bill Cassidy (R-LA) questions witnesses during a Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions hearing in Washington, DC on Sept. 17, 2025. Nathan Posner | Anadolu | Getty ImagesSen. Bill Cassidy on Monday proposed replacing enhanced Affordable Care Act premium tax credits with pre-paid health savings accounts.The Louisiana Republican's proposal comes as lawmakers scramble to find a remedy for skyrocketing costs of Obamacare health insurance premiums.The boosted ACA tax credits, which this year have lowered the cost of Obamacare plans for about 20 million Americans, are set to expire at the end of December.Cassidy's proposal would allow people who signed up for a so-called Bronze Plan through Obamacare marketplaces to get a pre-paid HSA, funded in part by the lapsed tax credits.While HSAs would not help pay for monthly premiums, Cassidy told reporters that they would help reduce the cost of health-care expenses, such as co-payments, deductibles, and coinsurance.Bronze plans  generally cover 60% of an enrollee's health costs, with the enrollee responsible for paying the remaining 40% out of pocket.\"Is there anybody who would not want to take a large portion of that, which we're using to help Americans purchase health care, and give it directly to the individual, so that 100% of its used to purchase health care, as opposed to, as opposed to giving that money to the insurance company, of which 20% goes for profit and overhead?\" asked Cassidy, who is chairman of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions.The federal government shut down on Oct. 1, and remained shut down for weeks when Senate Democrats refused to vote for a stopgap funding bill because it did not include an extension of the enhanced ACA credits.Last week, seven Democrats and independent Sen. Angus King of Maine, who caucuses with them, agreed to end the 43-day-long shutdown by voting for a funding bill. Their agreement came after Senate Majority Leader John Thune, D-.S.C.,  promised to hold a vote by mid-December on a bill of Democrats' choosing to extend the tax credits.But even a temporary extension of the ACA credits faces a near-impossible obstacle course to being passed into law, in part because it would require Republican support. GOP members of Congress have long tried to gut the Affordable Care Act, which became law under President Barack Obama with only Democratic votes.Cassidy said he is talking with other senators, as well as the Trump administration, about how his HSA plan would work.With roughly a month to go before a planned vote, lawmakers have little time to finalize their plans before presenting them.Yet Cassidy's plan is already meeting with some resistance from some Democrats and health-care policy experts.Larry Levitt, an expert with the KFF health policy research group, on Sunday responded to an interview Cassidy did with CBS' \"Face the Nation.\"\"Giving ACA enrollees cash in flexible spending accounts would help with out-of-pocket health costs like deductibles,\" Levitt tweeted.\"But, they wouldn't do someone much good if they can't afford health insurance to begin with and end up getting sick.\"On Monday, Levitt tweeted, \"Without the enhanced ACA premium tax credits, people would have a harder time buying plans with affordable deductibles.\"\"But, I do not believe this plan from @SenBillCassidy would cause a premium death spiral in the same way as other health account proposals that've been floated,\" he wrote.Death spirals occur when healthy people exit a health-care insurance plan, leading to ever-rising premiums for less healthy people who remain in the plan.",

    "body": "The Home Depot logo is displayed on a sign outside of a store on Sept. 6, 2025 in San Diego, California.  Kevin Carter | Getty ImagesHome Depot on Tuesday cut its full-year profit forecast and missed Wall Street's earnings expectations for the third straight quarter as it saw weaker home improvement demand, tepid consumer spending and lower-than-usual storm activity.The retailer said it now expects full-year sales will climb about 3% and comparable sales, which take out the impact of one-time factors like store openings and calendar differences, to be slightly positive. That compares with its previous expectations for full-year sales to grow by 2.8% and comparable sales to increase by 1%.The revised outlook includes an estimated $2 billion in incremental revenue from GMS, a building products distributor that Home Depot acquired earlier this year. The company's sales were not part of its previous full-year guidance.Home Depot expects full-year adjusted earnings per share to decline by about 5% from the year-ago period, compared with its prior expectations that they would fall by about 2%In a CNBC interview, Chief Financial Officer Richard McPhail said the retailer previously expected home improvement activity would increase. It also anticipated higher sales of roofing materials, generators and other supplies that typically sell before and after seasonal storms.Neither dynamic materialized, he said, putting pressure on the business. \"When we set guidance, we had anticipated that demand would begin to accelerate gradually in the back half of the year as interest rates and mortgage rates eased,\" he said. \"But what we saw was that ongoing consumer uncertainty and continued pressure in housing are disproportionately impacting home improvement demand.\"Here's what Home Depot reported for the fiscal third quarter compared with Wall Street's estimates, according to a survey of analysts by LSEG:Earnings per share: $3.74 adjusted vs. $3.84 expectedRevenue: $41.35 billion vs. $41.10 billion expectedHome Depot's stock was down about 3% in early trading on Tuesday. As of Monday's close, the company's shares are down about 8% so far this year. That trails the S&P 500's 13% gains during the same period.Fewer hurricanes and a 'deferral mindset'For Home Depot, housing turnover typically sparks larger and more lucrative projects as customers fix up their homes before or after moving. Those big projects, however, have dropped in frequency as higher interest rates have led to steeper mortgage rates and borrowing costs for loans, which a homeowner may use to pay for a kitchen remodel or major addition.Since roughly the middle of 2023, McPhail has told CNBC that homeowners have been in a \"deferral mindset.\" That's led to a bit of a waiting game for Home Depot, as it holds out for either lower mortgage rates or a shift by consumers who get used to higher mortgage rates as the new normal.In the most recent three-month period, that waiting game continued. McPhail told CNBC that demand was \"stable\" from the fiscal second quarter to the third quarter when adjusting for the lack of hurricanes. But, he added, \"at this point, it's hard to identify near-term catalysts that would lead to acceleration.\" Home Depot's net income for the three-month period that ended Nov. 2 dropped to $3.60 billion, or $3.62 per share, from $3.65 billion, or $3.67 per share, in the year-ago quarter. Revenue decreased from $40.22 billion in the year-ago quarter.Adjusting for one-time items, including the value of intangible assets, Home Depot reported earnings of $3.74 per share.Comparable sales rose 0.2% in the quarter, falling short of analysts' expectations of 1.4% growth, according to StreetAccount.Sales trends compared to the prior year slowed as the quarter progressed. Comparable sales were up 2% in August, up 0.5% in September and down 1.5% year-over-year in October, Billy Bastek, executive vice president of merchandising said on the company's earnings call.CEO Ted Decker said on an earnings call that the primary driver of that deceleration was the lack of storm activity — particularly when lapping a year-ago period with a lot of hurricanes. He said that pressure will continue into the fourth quarter.Compared with other big-box retailers, Home Depot's customers tend to be more financially stable. About 90% of its do-it-yourself customers own their homes and the home professionals who shop at the retailer tend to get hired by homeowners.Even so, McPhail told CNBC Home Depot gave a weaker outlook in part because shoppers across income groups are reluctant to take on high-dollar projects. He said a slower housing market and the higher cost of borrowing has contributed to the trend.He said other factors may also be having a chilling effect, including the prolonged government shutdown, an uptick in corporate layoff announcements and a decline in home values in some markets.However, Bastek said on the company's earnings call that Home Depot has not seen customers trading down to cheaper products. Instead, he said, they are often opting for more innovative and premium appliances, power tools or other items, which tend to cost more.Big-ticket transactions, which the company defines as costing $1,000 or more, rose 2.3% year over year. Still, Bastek added the company continues to see \"softer engagement in larger discretionary projects where customers typically use financing to fund renovation projects.\"Average ticket, the typical amount spent by customers at the store or on the company's website, rose 1.8% year over year in the quarter. However, customer transactions fell 1.6% year over year.A bright spot in the quarter was online sales, which rose by 11% year over year, McPhail said.Looking to pros for growthAs do-it-yourself customers postpone bigger projects, the company has tried to attract more business from contractors, roofers and other professionals.The company has made two key purchases of pro-related companies. Last year, it bought Texas-based SRS Distribution for $18.25 billion — the largest acquisition in its history. The company sells supplies to professionals in the landscaping, pool and roofing businesses. Home Depot acquired GMS earlier this year.Like other retailers, Home Depot has felt the pinch of higher costs on some imported items because of tariffs. McPhail said in May that the company was diversifying the countries where it sourced its goods and intended to \"generally maintain our current pricing levels across our portfolio.\"However, company leaders warned in August that it may have to hike prices in some categories because of higher tariffs.McPhail told CNBC that Home Depot has increased some items' prices, but said \"where there were price actions, they were modest.\" He said Home Depot has kept prices the same for some key items or even been able to reduce them. For example, he said, its bestselling 7½-foot Grand Duchess Christmas tree and many of its strings of lights for trees have dropped in price. ",

    "body": "A Panera Bread sign hangs on the exterior of the restaurant on July 25, 2025 in Miami, Florida. Joe Raedle | Getty ImagesWhen Panera Bread began shrinking its sandwiches and skimping on salads, it started shedding customers.Now, to win them back, the chain plans to reinvest in the business and undo many of those same cost-cutting measures, it said Tuesday.Once the No. 1 fast-casual brand in the U.S., Panera has dipped to No. 3, ceding the top spots to Chipotle Mexican Grill and Panda Express. Last year, its sales fell 5% to $6.1 billion, according to Technomic estimates. For years, the chain's traffic has been shrinking, according to CEO Paul Carbone, who took the reins earlier this year. Controversy after the chain's foray into energy drinks didn't help matters, either.Panera's troubles have coincided with a tough year for fast-casual restaurants. Chipotle, Sweetgreen and Cava have all cut their full-year forecasts as they see younger consumers eating out less frequently.Carbone has a plan to bring back customers. Under the strategy, named \"Panera RISE,\" the company aims to refresh its menu, focus on value, improve its service and build new restaurants. He said the plan has the backing of the franchisees who operate roughly half of its 2,200 U.S. locations, along with the support of JAB Holding, the investment arm of the Reimann family that owns the company.Panera's slide has been poorly timed for JAB. The firm has been plotting an IPO for the chain's parent company, Panera Brands, which also owns Caribou Coffee and Einstein Bros. Bagels.In 2021, four years after taking the chain private, JAB struck a deal with Danny Meyer's special purpose acquisition company for a merger that would take the company public again. But Panera scrapped those plans a year later, citing market conditions. In late 2023, the company confidentially filed for an initial public offering that still hasn't happened.When asked about the status of Panera's IPO plans, Carbone told CNBC that the chain's management team is currently focused on growing traffic and implementing the Panera RISE strategy.Entering the value warsPhase one of Panera's plan is to improve the quality of its food, reversing cost-cutting measures imposed in the face of high inflation, according to Carbone.\"We squeezed food costs. We squeezed labor,\" he said.Some of those changes happened while Carbone was chief financial officer. He now calls himself a \"reformed CFO\" — albeit one who still listens to earnings conference calls.\"It's really about death by a thousand paper cuts, it truly is,\" Carbone said about the chain's downturn.Take Panera's salads, for example. In the summer of 2024, Panera began using a mix of half romaine, half iceberg lettuce to make its salads, saving the chain money compared with when it was using romaine alone. This summer, it reverted back to entirely romaine salads.\"You know what guests told us? No one likes iceberg, and no one gets that and says, 'Oh my God, that white salad, it looks so appetizing,'\" Carbone said.And then there's the cherry tomato. Carbone said Panera is one of the few restaurant chains that doesn't slice the bite-sized tomatoes in half, a decision made to save on labor costs.\"We make the guest chase the cherry tomato around the bowl,\" he said.And when a salad comes with an avocado, customers have to cut the halved fruit themselves, rather than it coming presliced. The chain will start slicing the cherry tomatoes and avocados early next year.Plus, Panera's salads typically have five ingredients, while those of competitors like Sweetgreen feature as many as eight.But it wasn't just salads that were affected by the cost-cutting measures.\"In some instances, we shrunk portions, so guests would walk into our cafe to buy a sandwich that has gone up significantly in price, with lower-quality ingredients, in a smaller size,\" Carbone said.The menu refresh will also include new items. Last month, the chain announced that it is testing new \"fresca\" and \"energy refresher\" drinks.Panera previously offered highly caffeinated energy drinks, but it discontinued the line, which included Charged Lemonade, following two wrongful death lawsuits and related negative publicity. Panera denied wrongdoing and settled the lawsuits earlier this year.When it comes to value, Panera is planning on leaning into a barbell menu strategy, offering customers options on both the low- and high-price end. The approach has worked particularly well for casual-dining chains like Chili's, but Panera doesn't have the same appetizer offerings as a full-service restaurant.\"We haven't cracked the code yet,\" Carbone said. \"We're doing a lot of testing.\"Chains across the restaurant industry have embraced value offerings, from McDonald's Extra Value Meal to Applebee's \"2 for $25\" deal, igniting the so-called value wars. However, restaurants have to balance the desire to attract cash-strapped diners with maintaining their profit margins.To improve the customer experience, Panera is planning to invest more into labor. Like many restaurants, Panera in recent years scheduled fewer workers and relied more on the self-order kiosks it pioneered in the industry. That approach saved money, but customers often walked into a cafe and couldn't find an employee in sight, according to Carbone.Panera will also invest back into its kiosks, which it hasn't significantly upgraded since they first entered its restaurants roughly a decade ago. And its dining rooms will get a facelift, too.If these changes succeed in bringing back lapsed customers, then Panera's restaurants will become more profitable, fueling future restaurant growth. And those new bakery-cafes could look different.\"What does the cafe of the future look like? We're doing a lot of work around that, we're going to test different things,\" Carbone said.",

Khashoggi, who was a critic of the regime, was also a U.S. resident.Trump called the ABC News reporter \"fake news\" after she asked about Khashoggi, about claims by families of 9/11 victims that Saudi Arabia bankrolled the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks, and about the propriety of Trump's business investing in Saudi Arabia.\"You're mentioning somebody that was extremely controversial,\" Trump said of Khashoggi.\"A lot of people didn't like that gentleman that you're talking about, whether you like him or didn't like him, things happen,\" Trump said.Referring to bin Salman, Trump said, \"But he knew nothing about it, and we can leave it at that.\"\"You don't have to embarrass our guests by asking a question,\" Trump said.U.S. President Donald Trump (R) speaks during a bilateral meeting with Crown Prince and Prime Minister Mohammed bin Salman of Saudi Arabia (L) in the Oval Office of the White House on November 18, 2025 in Washington, DC.

But, you know, we have to focus on reality.\"\"Reality based in CIA documents, and based on a lot of documents that Osama bin Laden used Saudi people in that event, for one main purpose, is to destroy this [relationship], to destroy the American-Saudi relation,\" bin Salman said.\"It's really painful to hear .... anyone that been losing his life for you know, no real purpose or ... not in a legal way,\" bin Salman said, referring to Khashoggi.\"And it's been painful for us in Saudi Arabia,\" the prince said. \"We did all the right steps of investigation ... in Saudi Arabia, and we've improved our system to be sure that nothing happened like that. And it's painful, and it's a huge mistake, and we are doing our best that this still doesn't happen.\"Khashoggi's widow, in a social media post directed at Trump before the meeting with bin Salman, wrote, \"The murder of my husband has caused me to lose everything. There is unfinished business that remains including: the recovery of my husband's body & my rightful compensation as his widow.\"\"Much like the families in Israel, I would like to recover the remains of my husband so that I may have an appropriate religious burial ceremony,\" Hanan Elatr Khashoggi wrote in the post on X. \"And much like the 9-11 families, I am seeking financial compensation for the murder of my husband.\"Hanan Khashoggi separately told CNN in an interview that \"it is very painful for me\" to see Trump welcome bin Salman to the White House.The prince's visit is his first to the United States since Khashoggi was killed.",

    "body": "FILE PHOTO: Former FBI Director James Comey testified in front of the Senate Intelligence Committee in the Senate Hart building on Capitol Hill, on Thursday, June 8, 2017.Cheriss May | Nurphoto | Getty ImagesA federal judge on Monday paused an order by another judge requiring the Department of Justice to give former FBI Director James Comey all grand jury materials related to a criminal indictment that accuses him of lying to Congress in 2020 testimony.Judge Michael Nachmanoff said he would rule on whether to allow the order to take effect after considering objections to it by the DOJ and arguments in favor of it by Comey's lawyers.Nachmanoff gave the DOJ until Wednesday to file its objections in U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia; Comey's defense team has until Friday to respond.The judge's action came hours after Magistrate Judge William Fitzpatrick issued the order, and suggested that the charges against Comey could soon be dismissed because of potential \"misconduct\" by the prosecution. The charges were filed at the behest of President Donald Trump.Fitzpatrick, in a written opinion, said he \"is finding that the government's actions in this case — whether purposeful, reckless or negligent — raise genuine issues of misconduct.\"He said that interim U.S. Attorney Lindsey Halligan, who presented the case to the grand jury and asked it to charge Comey, potentially violated court orders and Comey's Fourth Amendment rights.There is \"a reasonable basis to question whether the government's conduct was willful or in reckless disregard of the law,\" Fitzpatrict wrote.\"The facts set forth herein and the particularized findings of the Court establish that 'ground[s] may exist to dismiss the indictment because of a matter that occurred before the grand jury.'\"Read more CNBC politics coverageTrump calls to revoke ABC's license over reporter's Epstein files questionAI could be causing ‘quiet time’ in labor market, top Trump economic aide Hassett saysTrump reverses stance on Epstein records, presses Republicans to support releaseFormer Fed Gov. Adriana Kugler violated trading rules while at central bank: ethics reportWoman pleads guilty to lying about astronaut wife accessing bank account from Space StationFitzpatrick acknowledged that ordering the DOJ to release to Comey all material related to the grand jury that indicted him, as well as an audio recording of the proceedings, is \"an extraordinary remedy.\"\"But given the factually based challenges the defense has raised to the government's conduct and the prospect that government misconduct may have tainted the grand jury proceedings, disclosure of grand jury materials under these unique circumstances is necessary to fully protect the rights of the accused,\" Fitzpatrick wrote.The judge noted that the only witness to testify before the grand jury, who was an FBI agent, was notified by another agent shortly before he testified that evidence obtained in the investigation of Comey might have included material protected by attorney-client privilege.Fitzpatrick also said he had identified two statements by Halligan made to the grand jury \"that on their face appear to be fundamental misstatements of the law that could compromise the integrity of the grand jury process.\"One of the statements, which the judge called \"a fundamental and highly prejudicial misstatement of the law,\" suggested to the grand jury that Comey does not have a Fifth Amendment right not to testify at trial.CNBC has requested comment from Halligan's office.Comey was indicted on Sept. 25 in federal court in Alexandria, Virginia, on charges of making a false statement and obstruction, in connection with his testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee in September 2020.During that testimony, Comey had denied authorizing another person at the FBI to act as an anonymous source for news reports about an investigation of 2016 Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton and her emails.Comey, who denies any wrongdoing, was indicted only days after Trump urged Attorney General Pam Bondi to prosecute the former FBI director, who has been a longtime foe of the president.Halligan was handpicked by Trump to lead the Eastern District of Virginia's office after her predecessor balked at seeking an indictment of Comey.Comey's trial is currently set for Jan. 5.",

    "body": "watch nowFanDuel and DraftKings on Tuesday said they are quitting the American Gaming Association, the leading trade organization representing casinos, gaming manufacturers and sportsbooks.In separate announcements, the companies said they were abandoning their AGA memberships because the direction of online betting — increasingly tied to booming prediction markets — does not align with the trade organization, they said.It's the latest escalation of a growing rift in the gambling world as prediction platforms like Kalshi and Polymarket, which allow customers to trade on events across pop culture, news and politics, skyrocket in popularity and push into sports.The AGA has taken a firm stand against prediction markets offering sports betting. It plans to introduce a resolution at a board meeting on Tuesday that would exclude from membership any company that offers prediction markets, according to people familiar with the matter who declined to be named speaking about internal matters.  Last week, Flutter-owned FanDuel announced it would launch a prediction platform called FanDuel Predicts in December in partnership with the CME. It plans to offer sports prediction trades only in states where sports betting isn't legal.  \"We recognize this direction is not aligned with the American Gaming Association's current priorities for its member operators. After thoughtful consideration, we have decided to step back from our AGA membership at this time,\" a FanDuel spokesperson told CNBC.DraftKings recently acquired Railbird, which has a federal license to offer event contracts. \"As the company's business strategy evolves—including with prediction markets—DraftKings determined that its plans no longer fully align with the AGA's direction in certain areas and have decided to relinquish its membership,\" a DraftKings spokesperson told CNBC.The AGA represents both commercial and tribal members, sometimes with competing interests.  The trade organization said in a statement it had accepted FanDuel's and DraftKings' \"request to relinquish their membership.\"\"We wish them the best, and we expect to maintain close ties to our mission to promote and protect legal, regulated gaming.\"FanDuel and DraftKings are also represented by the Sports Betting Alliance, which conducts more specific lobbying and outreach efforts on behalf of sports betting operators.",

    "body": "Methodiq brand advertisement. Courtesy: MethodiqIl Makiage parent company Oddity is branching out into medical-grade skin care with its new brand Methodiq, as the online retailer looks to compete with Hims and help to address what it called a \"broken medical care system.\" Methodiq, which has been in the works for four years and launched on Tuesday, is a telehealth platform that will offer 28 new products, including creams, supplements and cosmetics, that address acne, hyperpigmentation and eczema. The lineup is a mix of prescription and over-the-counter items that range in price from about $29 to around $59. Methodiq combines Oddity's investments into biotechnology, AI-based computational imaging, and digital retailing. It will allow the company to gain a slice of the burgeoning medical skin care market, which is projected to reach $113 billion this year, according to Research and Markets. Methodiq products. Courtesy: MethodiqThe company's expansion into medical skin care takes direct aim at Hims, which offers popular anti-acne medications and other prescriptions through a telehealth platform. The launch signals Oddity could move deeper into health care in the future. \"We have these 60 million users on our platform. We know a lot about them. Around half of them have some combo of acne, eczema, hyperpigmentation. We serve a lot of them, obviously, already with Il Makiage complexion products or foundation concealer. We've never had the opportunity before … to actually treat the condition,\" said Oddity finance chief Lindsay Drucker Mann. \"That's why dermatology is an obvious starting point for us. From there, there's many other medical domains for us to expand into.\" Oddity, which is set to announce 2025 third-quarter results on Wednesday, hasn't included Methodiq in its 2025 or 2026 revenue outlooks, primarily because it expects sales to make up only a small portion of overall revenue, said Drucker Mann. However, she said the brand has \"enormous revenue potential in the future,\" especially if Methodiq expands beyond just medical skin care.She pointed to Hims' goal of reaching $6.5 billion in annual revenue by 2030 and said it shows \"the size of what you can do with a successful telehealth\" platform. Still, the strategy doesn't come without challenges. Pharmaceutical products are heavily regulated, the sector is becoming more competitive and customer trust is hard to win.Plus, telehealth platforms can be difficult to scale safely. In March, The Wall Street Journal published an investigation into Hims showing how some patients experienced serious side effects after taking hair loss medication from the company. Most of the patients said they didn't realize the drugs could come with those side effects, while others felt they weren't adequately warned.The publication found unlike drugmakers, telehealth companies aren't required to disclose side effects and other risks in advertisements.How Methodiq works Oddity's investments into computational imaging and biotechnology are coming to life in Methodiq. In 2021, it acquired Voyage81, a deep tech AI-based computational imaging startup that was co-founded by the former head of research and development for one of the Israel Defense Forces' elite technological units. Two years later, it acquired biotech startup Revela and created Oddity Labs. The unit has been working to create brand-new molecules with artificial intelligence that can be used in its cosmetics brands and future lines.Voyage81's imaging capabilities and the new molecules from Oddity Labs are both part of the Methodiq platform. When consumers join Methodiq, they fill out information about their skin concerns and undergo a facial scan, which maps out their face and determines what conditions, if any, they have. A medical doctor then reviews the information and recommends a suite of products that patients receive in a \"kit\" at regular intervals. The kits can include widely available standard acne medication, such as the oral antibiotic Doxycycline, but also fresh approaches to anti-acne creams. Methodiq products. Courtesy: MethodiqFor example, Methodiq's Clindalaq product contains tretinoin, a prescription-strength topical retinoid used to treat acne and other skin concerns, but also a mix of other ingredients that aim to make it more desirable to consumers than the standard creams prescribed by doctors. It includes hydrocortisone to alleviate side effects associated with strong retinols, as well as aloe vera extract and vitamin E to make the product more hydrating. CNBC tested the product at Oddity's New York City headquarters earlier this month and found both the texture and smell was different from the generic tretinoin cream dispensed by pharmacies. While the generic was white and gloopy, the Clindalaq was smooth and blended into the skin without leaving a visible residue. It also didn't have a medicinal smell. \"We're able to deliver these very strong acne-fighting ingredients, but in a formulation that's tolerable and can help actively fight side effects all in one,\" said Alex Kaplan, Methodiq's vice president of product development. \"What we're able to deliver is a true beauty experience in a prescription formula.\" Expanding access to dermatologyOddity is expanding into medical skin care in part because plenty of people need it but don't always have access to a dermatologist, opening up a significant market opportunity. At least 50 million Americans are affected by acne and nearly 1 in 10 have the most common form of eczema, atopic dermatitis, according to the American Academy of Dermatology. However, there's no dermatologist at all in more than 60% of U.S. counties, according to a 2018 study published in JAMA Dermatology. Methodiq aims to address that need by providing access to medical professionals and products that combat common skin concerns. Methodiq CEO Tom Amsterdam said a clinician will review every patient intake, recommend products and then stay connected with the patient through the entire course of the treatment.While the platform isn't set up to handle video or voice telehealth sessions between patients and doctors, patients can stay in touch with their doctor through a chat function where they can update them on their progress and adjust their treatment plan as needed. All of the doctors will be based in the U.S., but not all of them will be board certified in dermatology, said Amsterdam. Dr. Amy Wechsler, a board-certified dermatologist based in New York City who is not connected to Methodiq, said having a wide range of doctors on staff to prescribe treatments can help increase access to care.  \"In many parts of the country, patients do not have easy access to a dermatologist, which is why pediatricians, internists and other healthcare providers step in to prescribe treatments for acne, hyperpigmentation, and eczema,\" Wechsler said in an email to CNBC. \"This can be safe as long as the provider is knowledgeable about the medications they're prescribing, including proper use, potential side effects, and when a patient should be referred to a dermatologist.\"",

    "body": "Momo Productions | Digitalvision | Getty ImagesThe standard Medicare Part B premium will increase to $202.90 per month in 2026, up $17.90, or 9.7%, from $185 per month in 2025, according to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.The increase marks the second-highest Part B premium increase in dollars, according to Mary Johnson, an independent Social Security and Medicare analyst. The highest increase of $21.60 per month happened in 2022.Retirees may see this as a \"continuation in relentless cost increases,\" Johnson said via email.Medicare Part B is medical insurance that covers both medically necessary and preventive services.Part B premiums are typically deducted directly from Social Security checks. Any increase to those monthly premium payments affects how much of an increase Social Security beneficiaries may see in their monthly checks in 2026.The Social Security Administration has announced a 2.8% cost-of-living adjustment for 2026, which is expected to add about $56 per month on average to retirement benefits.The Part B premium for 2026 may be seen by beneficiaries as \"taking a significant chunk of or even most of their COLA,\" Johnson said.A hold harmless provision ensures that Social Security benefit payments do not decrease from one year to the next as a result of Medicare Part B premium increases. That said, other automatic deductions from Social Security checks for premiums tied to private Medicare Advantage insurance plans or Part D prescription drug coverage may reduce benefits, according to Johnson.The $202.90 standard Part B premium rate will apply to individuals with modified adjusted gross income less than or equal to $109,000, and for married couples who file taxes jointly with modified AGI less than or equal to $218,000.Approximately 8% of Medicare Part B beneficiaries pay what is called an income-related monthly adjustment amount that is added to their monthly premiums if their incomes are higher, according to CMS.The annual deductible for Part B will be $283 in 2026, according to the agency, a 10% increase from the $257 annual deductible in effect for 2025.The increases to both Medicare Part B premiums and deductibles are primarily due to \"projected price changes and assumed utilization increases that are consistent with historical experience,\" according to the CMS fact sheet on the price changes.Income-related adjustment amounts are typically based on tax returns filed two years prior. Beneficiaries who have since had their income go down, or who have experienced a qualifying life event, may report that by submitting a form to the Social Security Administration.",

Smith Collection/gado | Archive Photos | Getty ImagesInternet infrastructure company Cloudflare was hit by an outage on Tuesday, knocking several major websites offline for global users.Many sites came back online within a few hours. In an update to its status page around 9:57 a.m. ET, Cloudflare said it had implemented a fix to resolve the outage, though it noted some users may still experience issues accessing its online dashboard.\"We are continuing to monitor for errors to ensure all services are back to normal,\" the company added.E-commerce platform Shopify, job search engine Indeed, Anthropic's Claude chatbot, President Donald Trump's Truth Social and Elon Musk's social media platform X were among the sites impacted by the Cloudflare issues, according to Downdetector, which itself could not be accessed briefly for some users. Some of NJ Transit's digital services were brought down by the outage.OpenAI's status page indicated ChatGPT and its Sora short-form video app had fully recovered after they experienced issues due to a \"third-party service provider.\"A Cloudflare spokesperson said the \"root cause\" of the outage was an automatically generated configuration file used to manage threat traffic that \"grew beyond an expected size of entries,\" which triggered a crash in the software system that handles traffic for several of its services.The company said it began to observe a \"spike in unusual traffic\" around 5:20 a.m. ET.There's no evidence that the outage was a result of an attack or caused by malicious activity, the spokesperson added.\"Given the importance of Cloudflare's services, any outage is unacceptable,\" the spokesperson said. \"We apologize to our customers and the internet in general for letting you down today.\"Cloudflare's software is used by many businesses worldwide, helping to manage and secure traffic for about 20% of the web. Among the services it provides are that it guards against distributed denial of service attacks, which are when malicious actors attempt to overload a website's system with so many traffic requests that it can't function.Shares of Cloudflare slid more than 2%.The issue comes less than a month after Amazon Web Services suffered a daylong disruption that took down numerous online services, followed by a global outage of Microsoft's Azure cloud and 365 services.In July 2024, a faulty software upgrade by cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike caused a widespread outage that temporarily halted flights, impacted financial services and pushed hospitals to delay procedures.Read more CNBC tech newsSenators push for probe into Trump-linked crypto firm over token sales tied to North Korea and RussiaArm custom chips get a boost with Nvidia partnershipBuffett's Google bet comes 2 decades after billionaire investor 'inspired' search giant's IPONvidia CEO Jensen Huang surprised investors with a 'half a trillion' forecast.

    "body": "An experimental Boeing 777X aircraft at the Dubai Air Show in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, on Monday, Nov. 17, 2025. Christopher Pike | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesEmirates is piling the pressure on Boeing to deliver on a $38 billion order placed this week, the airline's president told CNBC on Tuesday.Speaking to CNBC at the Dubai Airshow, Emirates President Tim Clark said he had faith Boeing could \"restore [its] former glory\" — but nonetheless, the airline is doing what it can to ensure the beleaguered aircraft manufacturer holds up its end of the agreement.Emirates announced Monday it has placed an order for 65 Boeing 777-9 planes, worth $38 billion at list prices — taking Emirates' total orderbook with the planemaker to 315 widebody jets. Clark told CNBC the airline was hoping to receive the first of the new Boeing aircraft in the second quarter of 2027.Emirates is Boeing's biggest customer when it comes to wide-body aircraft, but the airline has been struggling with prolonged delays to Boeing's 777X program amid certification and production challenges. Boeing has also struggled to deliver other aircraft, including its 737 jets, after a strike at the firm late last year hit production.\"We're kind of holding Boeing's feet to the fire,\" Clark said, noting that while the aircraft is \"sound,\" Boeing is having to contend with huge certification requirements that come with a new aircraft and slower processes at the Federal Aviation Administration which has been impacted by the U.S. government shutdown.Restoring Boeing's 'former glory'Emirates has been critical of delays to deliveries from Boeing in the past, with Chairman and CEO Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed Al Maktoum telling CNBC last year that the airline was \"not happy really with what's going on.\" Amid the delays, Emirates has spent billions of dollars retrofitting its older planes to plug capacity gaps.Other airlines have also been impacted by postponements to Boeing deliveries. Earlier this year, budget airline Ryanair cut its passenger traffic goal, citing Boeing delays.Despite Boeing's ongoing challenges, however, Clark told CNBC he expects Boeing can, and will, turn itself around.\"I know the Boeing of old, and I know what Boeing could do, and they were really, really a great company,\" he said. \"I see no reason why what has happened in the last decade cannot be fixed, and that Boeing cannot restore itself to its former glory of being an aeronautical engineering designer of excellence.\"watch nowBoeing has also come under intense scrutiny in recent years following a series of fatal crashes involving its aircraft. Earlier this year, a Boeing Dreamliner operated by Air India crashed moments after taking off from Ahmedabad, India. In late 2018, Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 — a Boeing 737 Max 8 aircraft — crashed in a rural area southeast of Addis Ababa, killing everyone on board. It came just months after another 737 Max 8 aircraft went down just after takeoff from Jakarta, Indonesia.When it comes to safety concerns, Clark insisted that Boeing has worked hard to shore up the security functions on its planes.Boeing is now focused on operational safety, quality control and reviewing systems and protocols across the board, Clark said. \"If they get all of that right, it will take time, but with the new management, they have a strong chance of restoring the company to its former glory,\" he added. \"We've got 270 now of the 777, the biggest 777 order probably in history, when you take it all together — I don't think we'd be doing that if we weren't confident they were going to be able to deliver,\" Clark said.\"So we're right behind them. We've been moaning, as you would expect — it has not been easy or cheap for us to remediate the lack of capacity, but in the end, you have to put your faith in what I believe to be a strong and sound company that well managed, they'll get themselves out of this and rolling out airplanes at pace in the next five [to] seven years.\"— CNBC's Emma Graham and Leslie Josephs contributed to this article.",

Now it's demonstrating a tool that IT specialists can use to see and manage those agents.The software, named Agent 365, provides a list of artificial intelligence agents inside companies' systems, even if they're from other companies, Microsoft announced Tuesday. The company will present the product to business leaders and information technology practitioners at its Ignite conference in San Francisco this week.\"In the same way you provision an identity for a new employee or a contingent worker, you'll provision identity and access controls for your agents,\" Judson Althoff, CEO of Microsoft's commercial business, told CNBC in an interview.With Agent 365, administrators will be able to approve new agents, see which ones are becoming popular and find out how many hours of employee time they're saving each week. They'll also be able to spot security risks and block agents. End users will be able to analyze agents' activities.Following the ascent of OpenAI's ChatGPT in late 2022, software companies have built AI agents capable of developing software, generating ads and performing other simple tasks. Traditional corporations have started buying in.Agents from Adobe, Cognition, Databricks, Glean, ServiceNow and Workday will automatically show up in Agent 365. The software will also display agents that customers have built with Microsoft's Azure AI Foundry and Copilot Studio. Other companies that sell AI agents can integrate with Agent 365, said Ray Smith, vice president of autonomous agents at Microsoft.EY, one of the world's top accounting firms, had built an internal catalog of its AI agents, but has started implementing Agent 365 to gain more control, said Mark Luquire, a managing director for the company.Companies selling cybersecurity software recognize the complexity that might result from agents proliferating. Okta, which sells software for managing access for employees, said in September that it will bring out tools for discovering agents and tracking their activity.Customers enrolled in Microsoft's Frontier program for receiving early access to AI features can request to try Agent 365, Smith said. Microsoft has not finalized pricing.WATCH: Microsoft sees 'huge' challenge and great opportunity as global economy enters a new phase, president sayswatch now",

    "body": "Larry SummersCameron Costa | CNBCFormer Treasury Secretary Larry Summers said Monday that he was stepping back from all public commitments amid fallout from the release of emails between him and the notorious sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.\"I am deeply ashamed of my actions and recognize the pain they have caused. I take full responsibility for my misguided decision to continue communicating with Mr. Epstein,\" Summers said in a statement obtained by CNBC.\"While continuing to fulfill my teaching obligations, I will be stepping back from public commitments as one part of my broader effort,\" said Summers, a former president of Harvard University who teaches at the school.Summers is a member of the board of OpenAI. He is also a columnist for Bloomberg News.CNBC has requested comment from OpenAI.Summer's statement came after Harvard's newspaper, the Crimson, published an article detailing his emails with Epstein, which came to light last week when the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee released more than 20,000 documents it obtained pursuant to a subpoena from Epstein's estate.U.S. financier Jeffrey Epstein appears in a photograph taken for the New York State Division of Criminal Justice Services' sex offender registry March 28, 2017 and obtained by Reuters July 10, 2019.New York State Division of Criminal Justice Services | Handout | ReutersThe Crimson noted that when Summers was \"pursuing a romantic relationship with a woman he described as a mentee, he sought guidance from a longtime associate: convicted sex offender Jeffrey E. Epstein.\"Emails and texts between the two men from November 2018 and July 2019, showed Summers, who was and is married, turning \"to Epstein for advice on his pursuit of the woman,\" the paper reported.That time frame was a decade after Epstein pleaded guilty in Florida state court to solicitation of prostitution from an underage girl.In the emails and texts, \"Epstein was quick to chime in with assurance and suggestions, describing himself in one November 2018 message as Summers' 'wing man.' \" the Crimson noted.\"Think for now I'm going nowhere with her except economics mentor,\" Summers wrote that same month. \"I think I'm right now in the seen very warmly in rear view mirror category.\"\"She must be very confused or maybe wants to cut me off but wants professional connection a lot and so holds to it.\"Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a Massachusetts Democrat and a former professor at Harvard Law, told CNN that Harvard should sever its ties to Summers.Summer is the director of the Mossavar-Rahmani Center for Business and Government at the Harvard Kennedy School, and this semester is teaching five courses at Harvard, the Crimson noted.Warren said Summers \"cannot be trusted\" with students, given his past relationship with Epstein.\"For decades, Larry Summers has demonstrated his attraction to serving the wealthy and well-connected, but his willingness to cozy up to a convicted sex offender demonstrates monumentally bad judgment,\" Warren told CNN.Read more about the Epstein filesHouse overwhelmingly passes bill to release Jeffrey Epstein filesTrump calls to revoke ABC's license over reporter's Epstein files questionJeffrey Epstein files: Larry Summers steps back from public commitments over email falloutJeffrey Epstein victims' ad calls for files to be released, Trump urges GOP to vote for House measureTrump reverses stance on Epstein records, presses Republicans to support releaseJeffrey Epstein on Trump: 'I know how dirty donald is'Trump to ask DOJ to probe Jeffrey Epstein involvement with Clinton, JPMorgan, SummersGoldman Sachs stands by top lawyer Kathy Ruemmler after her emails with Jeffrey Epstein exposedJeffrey Epstein files: House speaker announces vote next week on release of docs\"If he had so little ability to distance himself from Jeffrey Epstein even after all that was publicly known about Epstein's sex offenses involving underage girls, then Summers cannot be trusted to advise our nation's politicians, policymakers, and institutions — or teach a generation of students at Harvard or anywhere else.\"On Friday, Attorney General Pam Bondi, acting on a request from President Donald Trump, said she had asked Manhattan U.S. Attorney Jay Clayton to investigate Epstein's relationships with Summers, former President Bill Clinton, billionaire tech investor Reid Hoffman, and the bank JPMorgan Chase.Trump himself is a former friend of Epstein. The president has been criticized for months for the Department of Justice's refusal to release investigative files related to Epstein, who killed himself in August 2019, weeks after his arrest on federal child sex trafficking charges.The House of Representatives on Tuesday is set to vote on a measure that would force the DOJ to release the Epstein files.",

    "body": "Epstein abuse survivor Lisa Phillips speaks during a news conference with lawmakers on the Epstein Files Transparency Act outside the U.S. Capitol on November 18, 2025 in Washington, DC. Heather Diehl | Getty ImagesThe House on Tuesday voted nearly unanimously to order the Department of Justice to release all of its files on notorious sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, two days after President Donald Trump abruptly dropped his opposition to the bipartisan bill.The bill, brought by Reps. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., and Ro Khanna, D-Calif., passed 427-1. It will now head to the Senate.Rep. Clay Higgins, R-La., the only representative to oppose the legislation, said in an X post right after the vote that he has \"been a principled 'NO' on this bill from the beginning.\"\"If enacted in its current form, this type of broad reveal of criminal investigative files, released to a rabid media, will absolutely result in innocent people being hurt,\" he wrote.The push to release the Epstein files had previously faced opposition from more GOP lawmakers, following the lead of Trump, whose White House had warned that backing the effort would be considered a \"hostile act.\"While Trump on Sunday night suddenly urged House Republicans to vote in favor of the bill, he has continued to fume about the continued focus on Epstein in the media and on Capitol Hill.When ABC News reporter Mary Bruce asked Trump about the Epstein files earlier Tuesday afternoon, he lashed out, repeatedly insulting her and calling for ABC's broadcast license to be revoked.He reiterated that the Epstein matter \"is a Democrat hoax to try and get me not to be able to talk about\" his administration's accomplishments.A discharge petition that would have forced a vote on the bill earlier was delayed for weeks as House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., kept representatives out of session during the government shutdown. The prolonged absence also delayed the swearing-in of Democratic Rep. Adelita Grijalva of Arizona, the final signature needed to move the petition forward.The shutdown ended last Wednesday and Grijalva, after being sworn in, signed the discharge petition. But, with pressure mounting, Johnson said he would bring the Epstein bill to a vote earlier than expected.WASHINGTON, DC - NOVEMBER 18: U.S. Rep. Thomas Massie (R-KY) (C) speaks during a news conference with Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) and U.S. Rep. Ro Khanna (D-CA) on the Epstein Files Transparency Act outside the U.S. Capitol on November 18, 2025 in Washington, DC. Heather Diehl | Getty Images\"Today, we stand in a moment that will decide whether our government still belongs to the American people, or to those who prey on them,\" said a survivor of Epstein's abuse who spoke alongside a group of others at a news conference outside the U.S. Capitol on Tuesday morning.The survivors were joined by Massie, Khanna and GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, a longtime Trump loyalist who has recently become one of his critics.\"He called me a traitor for standing with these women and refusing to take my name off the discharge petition,\" Greene said of Trump at the presser.\"Today, you are going to see, probably a unanimous vote in the House to release the Epstein files. But the fight, the real fight, will happen after that,\" she said.Johnson said later Tuesday morning that he would vote for the bill, which he acknowledged could get unanimous support. But he nevertheless accused Democrats of \"forcing a political show vote on the Epstein files,\" and spoke at length about his issues with the discharge petition.One of his critiques has been that Epstein's victims may not be adequately protected. Massie, asked earlier Tuesday about Johnson's stance, called it a \"red herring.\"\"The survivors have always been in favor of this legislation,\" he said, noting that the bill instructs the DOJ to redact victims' names and identifying information.Speaker of the House Mike Johnson (R-LA) speaks during a press conference on Capitol Hill on November 18, 2025 in Washington, DC. Johnson addressed the \"Epstein Files\" ahead of a House vote on legislation which instructs the U.S. Department of Justice to release all files related to the late accused sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein. Roberto Schmidt | Getty ImagesTrump, a former friend of Epstein's who had a falling out with him years earlier, said on the campaign trail that he would support releasing the government's files from its investigations into the wealthy and well-connected financier. Epstein died in jail in 2019 while facing federal sex trafficking charges.But Trump's DOJ said in a July 6 memo that it had conducted an \"exhaustive review\" of Epstein-related matters and determined \"that no further disclosure would be appropriate or warranted.\"That determination, and Trump's repeated insistence that the focus on Epstein was a Democratic \"hoax,\" has spurred outrage across the political spectrum, including from some of Trump's own supporters.The House Oversight Committee last week released thousands of documents from Epstein's estate, including emails appearing to show Epstein discussing Trump.This is developing news.

Most of the investments are expected to be completed by 2027.The largest investment announced Tuesday is $453 million in Toyota's Buffalo, West Virginia, plant to increase assembly of four-cylinder hybrid-compatible engines.Other investments include $204.4 million in a plant in Georgetown, Kentucky, for four-cylinder hybrid-compatible engines and $125 million to expand Corolla production in Blue Springs, Mississippi, to include hybrid models.watch nowThe investments are expected to create 252 new jobs, according to Toyota, which is the second-largest seller of new vehicles in the U.S. behind General Motors.\"Customers are embracing Toyota's hybrid vehicles, and our U.S. manufacturing teams are gearing up to meet that growing demand,\" Kevin Voelkel, Toyota Motor North America senior vice president of manufacturing operations, said in a release. \"Toyota's philosophy is to build where we sell, and by adding more American jobs and investing across our U.S. footprint, we continue to stay true to that philosophy.\"Tuesday's news comes less than a week after the Japanese automaker confirmed plans that were announced last month by President Donald Trump to invest up to $10 billion more than previously expected over the next five years in the U.S.It also comes days after Toyota scion and Chairman Akio Toyoda reportedly wore a \"Make America Great Again\" hat and T-shirt featuring Trump and Vice President JD Vance while hosting a racing event at the Fuji Speedway in Japan.Automotive News on Sunday reported Toyoda, a racer and car enthusiast, hosted U.S. Ambassador George Glass at the event, which also included comments about tariffs.\"I'm not here to argue whether tariffs are good or bad. Every national leader wants to protect their own auto industry,\" Toyoda reportedly said. \"We are exploring ways to make tariffs a winner for everyone. The people we want most to be winners are our customers.\"Toyota and the entire automotive industry have been trying to navigate production plans amid regulatory changes impacting all-electric vehicles and Trump's litany of tariffs this year on new vehicles and auto parts.",

Nathan Howard | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesPresident Donald Trump on Tuesday called for ABC's broadcast license to be revoked as he angrily lashed out at a reporter from the network who asked why he has not released files on notorious sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, his former friend.\"I think you are a terrible reporter,\" Trump told ABC News White House correspondent Mary Bruce.The president said he did not like Bruce's \"attitude.\"\"You ought to go back and learn how to be a reporter. No more questions from you,\" Trump said in the Oval Office, where he was meeting with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman of Saudi Arabia.Trump's tirade came shortly before the House of Representatives voted overwhelmingly in favor of a bill to compel the Department of Justice to release all of its records on Epstein. The DOJ earlier this year refused to release those documents, despite prior promises by Attorney General Pam Bondi and other Trump administration officials.Trump does not need to wait for Congress to pass a bill. He could order the DOJ to release more Epstein files. \"Why wait for Congress to release the Epstein files?\" Bruice asked the president. \"Why not just do it now?\"Trump said, \"As far as the Epstein files ...  I have nothing to do with\" him.\"I threw him out of my club many years ago because I thought he was a sick pervert,\" Trump said, referring to his Mar-a-Lago Club in Palm Beach, Florida.\"People are wise to your hoax,\" the president told the reporter. \"Your crappy company is one of the perpetrators.\"\"And I'll tell you something,\" Trump said. \"I think the license should be taken away from ABC. Because your news is so fake and so wrong.\"\"We have a great commissioner ... who should look at that,\" he added, apparently referring to Federal Communications Commission Chair Brendan Carr, whose agency oversees broadcast licenses.In September, Carr threatened ABC's license over comments by late-night show Jimmy Kimmel about the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk.\"We can do this the easy way or the hard way,\" said Carr on a podcast at the time. \"These companies can find ways to change conduct, to take action, frankly, on Kimmel, or you know, there's going to be additional work for the FCC ahead.\"Hours after Carr's remarks, ABC suspended \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\" The show returned to air about a week later after backlash against ABC and its parent company, Disney.Trump has called he matter a \"hoax\" created by Democrats. But in reality, members of Trump's Make America Great Again movement were leading advocates for releasing the files.And Trump failed to dissuade Republican allies in Congress from supporting the bill to release the files.Trump in recent days said \"quiet, piggy,\" after another female journalist asked him aboard Air Force One about Epstein.Trump and Epstein had been longtime friends, but had a falling out years before Epstein killed himself in jail in August 2019 after being arrested on federal child sex trafficking charges.Last week, the House Oversight Committee released emails showing Epstein discussing Trump.In one email from 2019, Epstein wrote that Trump \"knew about the girls.\"On Sunday night, as the Epstein bill's chances of passage appeared to rise, Trump suddenly reversed course and urged his GOP allies to support the measure. On Monday, Trump said he would sign the bill if Congress passes it.",

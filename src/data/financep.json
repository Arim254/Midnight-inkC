    "body": "Signage is displayed outside the Sinclair Broadcast Group Inc. headquarters in Cockeysville, Maryland, U.S.Andrew Harrer | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesSinclair disclosed a stake in fellow broadcast station owner E.W. Scripps on Monday, in a move to push toward a merger of the companies.Sinclair, which acquired a roughly 8% position in Scripps per the filing, recently launched a strategic review of its own business that could result in a tie-up. Scripps, for its part, has seen its struggles mount in the competitive industry and is among the smallest of its peers.In the filing, Sinclair said it has been engaged in \"constructive\" discussions regarding a deal and believes that, if it were to reach an agreement, a transaction could be completed within nine to 12 months.Sinclair said in the filing that based on trading multiples, there would be an expected $300 million in synergies if a merger were to take place.Scripps' stock rose 40% on Monday while Sinclair's stock gained almost 5%.Sinclair, which acquired the stake for about $15.6 million, declined to comment beyond the SEC filing.In a statement on Monday, Scripps said its board \"will take all steps appropriate to protect the company and the company's shareholders from the opportunistic actions of Sinclair or anyone else.\"\"Scripps' board of directors and management are focused on driving value for all of the company's shareholders through the continued execution of its strategic plan,\" the company said in its statement. \"The board and management are aligned on doing only what is in the best interest of all of the company's shareholders as well as its employees and the many communities and audiences it serves across the United States.\"The statement added that the board continues to evaluate \"any transactions and other alternatives that would enhance the value of the company and would be in the best interest of all company shareholders.\"Broadcast TV station group owners have suffered like the rest of media companies in recent years due to the shift away from the traditional pay-TV bundles and toward streaming. These broadcast stations, for the most part, make the majority of their money from so-called retransmission fees, which are paid on a per-subscriber rate by traditional TV distributors.Broadcast station owners like Sinclair have been eager to do mergers as they push for deregulation under the Trump administration.In August, Nexstar Media Group, the biggest owner of these stations, agreed to acquire Tegna for $3.54 billion.Sinclair, meanwhile, is also considering spinning off or splitting its ventures unit, which includes pay-TV network The Tennis Channel and marketing technology business Compulse, which was recently rebranded to Digital Remedy.Sinclair and its advisors held discussions with potential merger partners earlier this year, CNBC previously reported.",

    "body": "Mug shot of Eric Gillespie, Govini Founder and Chairman.Courtesy: Pennsylvania Attorney GeneralGovini founder Eric Gillespie urged a person who he believed to be a dad offering his 10-year-old daughter to be sexually abused to use encrypted chat platforms, a Pennsylvania criminal complaint alleges.\"Signal is safer for er small talk,\" Gillespie wrote to the purported father, who was actually an undercover law-enforcement agent, according to a transcript of a chat included in the criminal complaint obtained by CNBC.Gillespie then wrote that Session, another commonly used end-to-end encrypted platform, is \"fine but less secure\" than Signal, the filing says.While chatting in Session, he sent the agent multiple photos of a \"recent playmate\" wearing a diaper and made repeated graphic references to sex acts with children, court documents state.Gillespie also wrote that he preferred young children: \"best when they can't talk.\"The charging documents note that users can delete media and messages sent in Session, and because of that, the agent could not get screenshots of media files sent by Gillespie.The Pennsylvania Office of Attorney General said that the chat with the agent began in an online forum often used by people attempting to arrange meetings with children.The men then moved their discussion to Session, according to the AG's office, which last week said it had arrested and charged Gillespie with four felony counts, including unlawful sexual contact with a minor.He is being held without bond.His arrest came at a pivotal time for Govini, a defense contractor that is a key player in the U.S. military's push to modernize.Gillespie's lawyer, David Shrager of Shrager Defense Attorneys, told CNBC that he \"vigorously denies these charges.\"\"In this case, two adults were lying to each other in an internet fantasy chat, where at least one of the participants was using AI,\" Shrager said.The criminal complaint notes that at one point in the conversation, the agent sent \"A photo media file of an undercover female Agent age regressed with AI technology to appear approximately 10 years of age.\"That is the only mention of the use of artificial intelligence in the complaint.\"It's easy to understand why people rush to judgment when they hear about these types of charges,\" Shrager told CNBC.The attorney said that he believes Gillespie will be exonerated.Gillespie is scheduled to appear at a preliminary hearing on Thursday before Magisterial District Judge John Ditzler in Lebanon County, Pennsylvania.Govini last week called Gillespie a \"depraved individual\" in a statement announcing his termination as executive chairman of the company's board of directors.Govini said that Gillespie \"has no role with the company and is not a majority shareholder.\"\"Since being terminated, he will not receive a paycheck,\" the company said.The company did not disclose the current level of Gillespie's stake in Govini.Earlier this year, Govini landed a nearly $1 billion contract with the Department of Defense and joined the U.S. Army's Next Generation Command Control program.In October, Govini announced a $150 million investment from Bain Capital.Bain declined to comment on Gillespie's arrest.Gillespie was quoted prominently in a news release about Bain's investment.\"I founded Govini to create an entirely new category of software built to transform how the U.S. government uses AI and data to make decisions,\" Gillespie said at the time. \"After methodically developing our proprietary technology, that vision is now a reality.\"Accel and Salesforce Ventures are also major investors in Govini. Neither company has responded to requests for comment.Multiple people familiar with Govini, and who had personal contact with Gillespie, said that he had an active role at the company. Documents and text messages reviewed by CNBC support that claim.One person, who asked not to be named in order to discuss internal communication, described Gillespie as the point man for key financial dealings.In a statement responding to questions about his day-to-day involvement at the company, Govini said, \"Mr. Gillespie had opinions and ideas and did not hesitate to share them.\"\"In his capacity as Executive Chairman, he was aware of and consulted on the operations of the leadership team,\" the company said.Pentagon officials last week said that they are looking into Gillespie's arrest and possible security issues.CNBC asked the department if it is looking at possible actions related to the company's status as a government contractor.\"While the Department cannot comment on individual security clearances in accordance with the Privacy Act, we take these allegations very seriously,\" a senior Pentagon official said in a statement.",

    "body": "FILE PHOTO: Former FBI Director James Comey testified in front of the Senate Intelligence Committee in the Senate Hart building on Capitol Hill, on Thursday, June 8, 2017.Cheriss May | Nurphoto | Getty ImagesA federal judge on Monday paused an order by another judge requiring the Department of Justice to give FBI Director James Comey all grand jury materials related to a criminal indictment that accuses him of lying to Congress in 2020 testimony.Judge Michael Nachmanoff said he would rule on whether to allow the order to take effect after considering objections to it by the DOJ and arguments in favor of it by Comey's lawyers. Nachmanoff gave the DOJ until Wednesday to file its objections in U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia; Comey's defense team has until Friday to respond.The judge's action came hours after Magistrate Judge William Fitzpatrick issued the order, and suggested that the charges against Comey could soon be dismissed because of potential \"misconduct\" by the prosecution. The charges were filed at the behest of President Donald Trump.Fitzpatrick, in a written opinion, said he \"is finding that the government's actions in this case — whether purposeful, reckless or negligent — raise genuine issues of misconduct.\"He said that interim U.S. Attorney Lindsey Halligan, who presented the case to the grand jury and asked it to charge Comey, potentially violated court orders and Comey's Fourth Amendment rights. There is \"a reasonable basis to question whether the government's conduct was willful or in reckless disregard of the law,\" Fitzpatrict wrote.\"The facts set forth herein and the particularized findings of the Court establish that 'ground[s] may exist to dismiss the indictment because of a matter that occurred before the grand jury.'\"Read more CNBC politics coverageAI could be causing ‘quiet time’ in labor market, top Trump economic aide Hassett saysTrump reverses stance on Epstein records, presses Republicans to support releaseFormer Fed Gov. Adriana Kugler violated trading rules while at central bank: ethics reportWoman pleads guilty to lying about astronaut wife accessing bank account from Space StationFitzpatrick acknowledged that ordering the DOJ to release to Comey all material related to the grand jury that indicted him, as well as an audio recording of the proceedings, is \"an extraordinary remedy.\"\"But given the factually based challenges the defense has raised to the government's conduct and the prospect that government misconduct may have tainted the grand jury proceedings, disclosure of grand jury materials under these unique circumstances is necessary to fully protect the rights of the accused,\" Fitzpatrick wrote.The judge noted that the only witness to testify before the grand jury, who was an FBI agent, was notified by another agent shortly before he testified that evidence obtained in the investigation of Comey might have included material protected by attorney-client privilege.Fitzpatrick also said he had identified two statements by Halligan made to the grand jury \"that on their face appear to be fundamental misstatements of the law that could compromise the integrity of the grand jury process.\"One of the statements, which the judge called \"a fundamental and highly prejudicial misstatement of the law,\" suggested to the grand jury that Comey does not have a Fifth Amendment right not to testify at trial.CNBC has requested comment from Halligan's office.Comey was indicted on Sept. 25 in federal court in Alexandria, Virginia, on charges of making a false statement and obstruction, in connection with his testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee in September 2020.During that testimony, Comey had denied authorizing another person at the FBI to act as an anonymous source for news reports about an investigation of 2016 Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton and her emails.Comey, who denies any wrongdoing, was indicted only days after Trump urged Attorney General Pam Bondi to prosecute the former FBI director, who has been a longtime foe of the president.Halligan was handpicked by Trump to lead the Eastern District of Virginia's office after her predecessor balked at seeking an indictment of Comey.Comey's trial is currently set for Jan. 5.",

    "body": "Senator Bill Cassidy (R-LA) questions witnesses during a Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions hearing in Washington, DC on Sept. 17, 2025. Nathan Posner | Anadolu | Getty ImagesSen. Bill Cassidy on Monday proposed replacing enhanced Affordable Care Act premium tax credits with pre-paid health savings accounts.The Louisiana Republican's proposal comes as lawmakers scramble to find a remedy for skyrocketing costs of Obamacare health insurance premiums.The boosted ACA tax credits, which this year have lowered the cost of Obamacare plans for about 20 million Americans, are set to expire at the end of December.Cassidy's proposal would allow people who signed up for a so-called Bronze Plan through Obamacare marketplaces to get a pre-paid HSA, funded in part by the lapsed tax credits.While HSAs would not help pay for monthly premiums, Cassidy told reporters that they would help reduce the cost of health-care expenses, such as co-payments, deductibles, and coinsurance.Bronze plans  generally cover 60% of an enrollee's health costs, with the enrollee responsible for paying the remaining 40% out of pocket.\"Is there anybody who would not want to take a large portion of that, which we're using to help Americans purchase health care, and give it directly to the individual, so that 100% of its used to purchase health care, as opposed to, as opposed to giving that money to the insurance company, of which 20% goes for profit and overhead?\" asked Cassidy, who is chairman of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions.The federal government shut down on Oct. 1, and remained shut down for weeks when Senate Democrats refused to vote for a stopgap funding bill because it did not include an extension of the enhanced ACA credits.Last week, seven Democrats and independent Sen. Angus King of Maine, who caucuses with them, agreed to end the 43-day-long shutdown by voting for a funding bill. Their agreement came after Senate Majority Leader John Thune, D-.S.C.,  promised to hold a vote by mid-December on a bill of Democrats' choosing to extend the tax credits.But even a temporary extension of the ACA credits faces a near-impossible obstacle course to being passed into law, in part because it would require Republican support. GOP members of Congress have long tried to gut the Affordable Care Act, which became law under President Barack Obama with only Democratic votes.Cassidy said he is talking with other senators, as well as the Trump administration, about how his HSA plan would work.With roughly a month to go before a planned vote, lawmakers have little time to finalize their plans before presenting them.Yet Cassidy's plan is already meeting with some resistance from some Democrats and health-care policy experts.Larry Levitt, an expert with the KFF health policy research group, on Sunday responded to an interview Cassidy did with CBS' \"Face the Nation.\"\"Giving ACA enrollees cash in flexible spending accounts would help with out-of-pocket health costs like deductibles,\" Levitt tweeted.\"But, they wouldn't do someone much good if they can't afford health insurance to begin with and end up getting sick.\"On Monday, Levitt tweeted, \"Without the enhanced ACA premium tax credits, people would have a harder time buying plans with affordable deductibles.\"\"But, I do not believe this plan from @SenBillCassidy would cause a premium death spiral in the same way as other health account proposals that've been floated,\" he wrote.Death spirals occur when healthy people exit a health-care insurance plan, leading to ever-rising premiums for less healthy people who remain in the plan.",

    "body": "Jensen Huang, CEO of Nvidia, reacts during the 2025 Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) CEO Summit in Gyeongju, South Korea, October 31, 2025.Kim Soo-hyeon | ReutersArm on Monday said that central processing units based on its technology will be able to integrate with AI chips using Nvidia's NVLink Fusion technology.The move will make it easier for customers of both companies who prefer a custom approach to their infrastructure — namely hyperscalers —to pair Arm-based Neoverse CPUs with Nvidia's dominant graphics processing units.It's the latest example of Nvidia using dealmaking to partner with nearly every major technology company as it finds itself at the center of the AI industry. The announcement signals that Nvidia is opening up its NVLink platform to integrate with a wide variety of custom chips, instead of forcing customers to use its CPUs.Nvidia currently sells an AI product called Grace Blackwell that pairs multiple GPUs with an Nvidia-branded Arm-based CPU. Other configurations include servers that use CPus from Intel or Advanced Micro Devices.But Microsoft, Amazon and Google are all developing or deploying Arm-based CPUs in their clouds to give them more control over the set ups and reduce their costs.Arm doesn't make CPUs but it licenses its instruction set technology that those chips need. The company also sells designs that allow partners to more quickly build Arm-based chips.As part of Monday's announcement, Arm said that custom Neoverse chips will include a new protocol that'll allow them to move data seamlessly with GPUs.The CPU has historically been the most important part in a server. But generative AI infrastructure is based around the AI accelerator chip, which in most cases is an Nvidia GPU. As many as eight GPUs can be paird with a CPU in an AI server.In September, Nvidia said it would invest $5 billion into Intel, the leading CPU maker. A key part of the deal was to enable Intel CPUs to integrate into AI servers using Nvidia's NVLink technology.Nvidia reached an agreement to buy Arm for $40 billion in 2020, but the deal failed in 2022 because of regulatory issues in the U.S. and U.K. Nvidia had a small stake in Arm, which is majority-owned by Softbank, as of February.Meanwhile, Softbank liquidated its entire stake in Nvidia earlier this month and Softbank is backing the OpenAI Stargate project, which plans to use Arm technology in addition to chips from Nvidia and AMD.WATCH: Nvidia's options pricing can swing 6-7% in either direction, says Susquehanna's Murphywatch now",

All companies saw shares dip as much as 6%.Morgan Stanley analysts wrote that computer makers are in the midst of an unprecedented pricing \"supercycle,\" as hyperscalers continue to accelerate data center demand, pushing hardware valuations to reach all-time highs.Rising costs in the DRAM, dynamic random access memory, and NAND memory, a flash memory typically used in memory cards, businesses could put pressure on margins, especially as memory fulfillment rates may fall as low as 40% over the next two quarters, according to the bank.\"This as an emerging, and potentially significant, risk to CY26 earnings estimates for our Global Hardware OEM/ODM universe, where memory accounts for 10-70% of a products' bill of materials,\" analysts wrote.Read more CNBC tech newsDespite Coinbase departure, only 28 companies have left Delaware this yearThe question everyone in AI is asking: How long before a GPU depreciates?'Vibe revenue': AI companies admit they're worried about a bubbleWall Street cools on Oracle's buildout plans as debt concerns mount: 'AI sentiment is waning'Major DRAM and NAND manufacturers have been hiking prices as climbing AI infrastructure demand continues to bleed memory supplies dry.

Increased device prices were unable to offset the soaring input costs, causing original equipment and design manufacturers to experience compressed gross margins.\"During this period, we saw earnings pressure and multiple de-rating from hardware stocks with elevated DRAM exposure, lower pricing power, and narrower margins, but outperformance from companies able to pass off costs to end-customers,\" analysts wrote.Dell was highlighted as one of the hardware companies most exposed to rising memory costs, noting that the company's gross margin contracted by 95 to 170 basis points during the last memory cycle.The company is one of Nvidia's major customers and builds computers around the AI giant's chips, which it then sells to end-users such as cloud service CoreWeave.\"This is important as history tells us that companies facing margin headwinds underperform peers with similar growth rates, but stable-to-expanding margins,\" analysts wrote.Analysts expect increased DRAM and NAND costs to weigh on the PC maker's margins over the next 12 to 18 months.",

    "body": "Epstein Survivors Launch National PSA Calling for Release of Remaining FilesSource: WorldWithoutExploitation.orgA group of victims of Jeffrey Epstein in a new ad calls for Congress to pass a measure to force the Department of Justice to release investigative files about the notorious sex offender, following months of resistance to that by the Trump administration.\"Five administrations and we're still in the dark,\" the public service announcement says at the end, after the victims hold up photos showing themselves as girls and young women, when Epstein began abusing them.\"Call your Congress member and demand they release all the Epstein files,\" the PSA produced by the group World Without Exploitation says.The ad comes in advance of a House of Representatives vote on the measure. NBC News reported Monday that House GOP leaders intend to put the Epstein resolution on the floor for a vote on Tuesday.On Sunday night, in a major reversal, President Donald Trump urged House Republicans to vote in favor of the measure. Trump last week pressured congressional Republicans not to support a petition that forced the vote.But he now seems to acknowledge the likelihood of the Republican-controlled House, and potentially the Senate, voting in favor of the measure.Trump and the DOJ for months have resisted demands that they release the Epstein files after Attorney General Pam Bondi reneged on promises to make those documents public.\"I was 17 when I met Jeffrey Epstein,\" said Danielle Bensky, one of the women in the ad, said in a statement.\"I was an aspiring ballerina working odd jobs to support my mother, who was battling a brain tumor, and to keep up with my training,\" Bensky said.\"A woman told me about a wealthy philanthropist who might help. What began as a chance to pay for dance lessons turned into months of abuse,\" she said. \"Epstein used my mother's illness to control me. He promised help and threatened to take it away if I spoke. It took me years to tell the truth, and I tell it now because too many people still believe this story should stay hidden.\"A billboard in Times Square, paid for by the group Home of the Brave, highlights Jeffrey Epstein's comment that Donald Trump \"of course he knew about the girls.\", on November 17, 2025 in New York City. Adam Gray | Getty ImagesAnother victim, Annie Farmer, in a statement said, \"When I was 16, I trusted adults who told me they wanted to help me succeed. That trust was taken advantage of in a way that shaped the rest of my life.\"Farmer also said, \"The people who shielded Epstein have had decades of protection. Survivors have had decades of unanswered questions. Sharing the remaining documents helps correct that imbalance.\"Trump, in a Truth Social post on Sunday, said, \"House Republicans should vote to release the Epstein files.\"\"Because we have nothing to hide, and it's time to move on from this Democrat Hoax perpetrated by Radical Left Lunatics in order to deflect from the Great Success of the Republican Party, including our recent Victory on the Democrat 'Shutdown,'\" Trump wrote.Despite Trump's comment about Democrats, the measure has been pushed by Rep. Thomas Massie, a Kentucky Republican. Massie has said that 100 or more Republicans in the House might end up voting for it.Read more CNBC politics coverageAI could be causing ‘quiet time’ in labor market, top Trump economic aide Hassett saysTrump reverses stance on Epstein records, presses Republicans to support releaseFormer Fed Gov. Adriana Kugler violated trading rules while at central bank: ethics reportWoman pleads guilty to lying about astronaut wife accessing bank account from Space StationTrump's post came after a House committee released emails written by Epstein years after his long friendship with Trump fell apart.And it came days after Bondi said the DOJ would, at Trump's behest, investigate relationships between Epstein and former President Bill Clinton, JPMorgan Chase, former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers, billionaire tech investor Reid Hoffman and others.Trump \"knew about the girls,\" Epstein wrote the author Michael Wolff in April 2019, three months before Epstein was arrested on child sex trafficking charges, during Trump's first term in the White House. The email did not say what Epstein meant by that. Epstein killed himself in a Manhattan jail in August 2019.In December 2018, in response to an unidentified person who had mentioned Trump being targeted for a \"take down,\" Epstein replied, \"its wild. because I am in the one able to take him down.\"watch nowYears earlier, in April 2011, Epstein wrote to Ghislaine Maxwell, who is now serving a 20-year prison term for procuring girls to be sexually abused by him.\"I want you to realize that the dog that hasn't barked is trump,\" Epstein wrote, without elaborating on what that meant.\"He has never once been mentioned,\" Epstein wrote in the same email, after saying that a woman who has been identified as a victim of his \"spent hours at my house with\" Trump.The Epstein emails were obtained from his estate through a subpoena issued by the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee.Trump has denied having known about Epstein's serial sexual abuse of underage girls and young women when they were friends. The president has never been charged in connection with any of Epstein's conduct.",

    "body": "2025 Jeep Cherokee SUVStellantisAUBURN HILLS, Mich. — Jeep is betting Americans still love a good comeback story.It's a mantra that's reverberating through the quintessential SUV brand — from its CEO to a marketing campaign with LL Cool J — following yearslong sales and market share declines that have taken a toll on Jeep and its parent company, Stellantis.\"This isn't just a comeback. This is the Jeep brand reclaiming a segment we invented and defined,\" Jeep CEO Bob Broderdorf said during a recent media event.Jeep has been in a rut this decade, despite the brand's well-known off-road capabilities that have carried it for most of the past century. It has experienced six consecutive years of U.S. sales declines amid a leadership carousel, dearth of new products and a failed premium pricing strategy to boost profits.But now, the coveted SUV brand has realigned pricing across its lineup, scored its best quarterly sales gain in more than two years and is in the midst of its largest mainstream product blitz this decade.\"We're going to grow, grow and grow,\" Broderdorf told CNBC sitting in a redesigned 2026 Jeep Grand Wagoneer at the company's design dome in suburban Detroit. \"That's the mission. And do it in a healthy way.\"watch nowThen-head of Jeep North America Bob Broderdorf speaks during the Stellantis press conference at the AutoMobility LA 2024 auto show at the Los Angeles Convention Center on November 21, 2024.Etienne Laurent | AFP | Getty ImagesThe redesigned Grand Wagoneer is symbolic of the brand's troubles and comeback attempt. It was Jeep's foray into luxury — topping $111,000 fully loaded in 2021 — that was relatively overpriced and overcomplicated compared with its peers and experienced several production and quality issues.The redesigned model lineup is less expensive, simpler and better positioned against other large American SUVs rather than foreign competitors such as Land Rover. Its production issues also have eased.\"We confused our buyers. We confused our dealers,\" Broderdorf said at the media event. \"I'm here to tell you we got the message. We're fixing it.\"But some things take longer than others to fix in the automotive world. The brand's sales remain significantly lower than expectations, and Jeep's overall quality problems remain a work in progress after the realignment of its vehicles and pricing strategy.\"This is one of the areas that needs to improve. We have been improving, but proof is in the pudding,\" Broderdorf told CNBC.Among 32 major automotive brands, Jeep ranked last in Consumer Reports' annual grading last year that includes a combination of road test scores, safety ratings, and predicted reliability and owner satisfaction data.Most recently, the brand announced a recall of more than 320,000 plug-in hybrid Wrangler and Jeep Grand Cherokee models due to a risk of fire. The company filed a recall late last month with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, but no remedy has been released.The company told CNBC a solution is expected in December involving a software update to the high-voltage battery pack control module of the vehicles to improve diagnostic capability for early detection of internal battery damage.Read more CNBC auto newsInside Ford’s new HQ: Rotisserie chickens and design secretsFord partners with Amazon for dealers to sell used vehicles onlineJeep eyes U.S. comeback following yearslong sales troublesTesla recalls 10,500 Powerwall 2 battery systems due to overheating, fire riskJeep ReconThe recall comes at an inopportune time, as Jeep launches a Wrangler-inspired, all-electric SUV called the Recon. The vehicle will be revealed this week ahead of the Los Angeles Auto Show after first debuting as a concept vehicle in 2021.The Recon was initially hailed as key to the Jeep brand's future, with executives saying it would help the company become a leader in all-electric vehicle sales, including a prior plan for the brand to achieve 50% EV sales in the U.S. by 2030.Electric Jeep Recon SUV.JeepBut expectations have diminished as Stellantis appointed a new CEO and demand for EVs slowed amid regulatory changes, including the end of up to $7,500 in federal incentives in September to purchase a plug-in electric vehicle.Broderdorf said the end of federal incentives is expected to impact sales across the industry, including with the Recon, but the new SUV functions as an EV \"bookend\" alongside the sportier Wagoneer S for the Jeep brand's electric portfolio.\"I'm not going to just chase volume just to chase volume,\" he said during a recent media call. \"I want to sell cars in the right way. Everybody who wants a [battery-electric vehicle], Recon, I want to make sure that we're there for them. After that, it doesn't really matter to me.\"The Recon is being produced at Stellantis' Toluca Assembly Plant in Mexico alongside the Wagoneer S, Jeep Compass and the new Jeep Cherokee, which is being offered exclusively as a hybrid vehicle.Broderdorf, who started leading the brand in February, said the plant can easily adjust to produce the higher-volume Compass and Cherokee depending on demand for EVs. Both gas-powered vehicles also are expected to be manufactured in the U.S. in the coming years for additional flexibility.Several automakers reported major declines in their EV sales in October following the end of the federal incentives as well as the Trump administration eliminating fuel economy and emissions fines, which EVs helped offset.Electric Jeep Recon SUVJeepJeep has released few details about the Recon other than it will be a \"brother\" to the Wrangler — Jeep's iconic, off-road and open-air SUV. Jeep previously touted a smaller concept version of the vehicle achieving 0-60 mph in roughly two seconds.The Recon is the last of four new vehicles Jeep is revealing in four months. It started with the crucial new Cherokee SUV, followed by updated versions of the Jeep Grand Cherokee and Grand Wagoneer.Before the Jeep Wagoneer S last year and upcoming Recon, Jeep was focusing on electrified sales of plug-in hybrid electric versions of its Wrangler and Grand Cherokee rather than all-electric vehicles.American comeback?Part of Jeep's \"comeback\" has included an aggressive push in new marketing and advertising campaigns that have included actor and musician LL Cool J and a raunchy ad campaign featuring comedian Iliza Shlesinger for the Jeep Grand Wagoneer.The campaigns, led since June by Jeep's new vice president of marketing and communications, Wendy Orthman, are consistent with Broderdorf's comeback mantra, including featuring LL Cool J's \"Mama Said Knock You Out.\"\"Don't call it a comeback. I been here for years,\" the iconic rapper and actor says in the song featured in the ad campaign, calling Jeep \"the original influencer.\"The marketing and advertising efforts help, but the most important thing for the company remains new products, specifically the Jeep Cherokee that competes in the highly popular compact/midsize SUV markets, industry watchers said.\"They're still trying to fix things, getting the pricing right, getting the product right,\" said Stephanie Brinley, associate director in AutoIntelligence at S&P Global Mobility. \"But there's a lot of potential, especially with the Cherokee coming back. There's a lot still coming on in the pipeline, and I think it'll position them in a good space.\"The company axed a prior version of the Cherokee as well as a smaller SUV called the Renegade amid profit pressures under former CEO Carlos Tavares in 2023.Jeep's sales through the third quarter of this year were up less than 0.5% compared with a year earlier. Jeep's U.S. market share has fallen from 5.4% in 2019 to 3.7% since 2024, according to Cox Automotive.Jeep's been dealing with a spiraling sales decline that started after the brand reached an all-time high of more than 973,000 SUVs sold in 2018. The brand's sales have fallen 40% since then to less than 590,000 units last year in the U.S.As sales plummeted, Jeep's average transaction prices, or ATPs, were around $54,000 during 2023-24 — well above the industry average of roughly $48,500 or less during that time period, according to Cox Automotive.Jeep's ATPs through the third quarter of this year were less than $49,800, according to Cox. That remains a premium over the average industry of $48,588 but is far lower than prior years.One thing that hasn't been declining this year for Jeep is its inventory levels, according to Cox Automotive. Jeep had the highest days' supply of any major brand other than Ford's Lincoln at 146 days in October. The industry average for days' supply, which calculates the amount of days of inventory dealerships have based on recent sales, was 88 days, Cox reports.\"Looking at mainstream brands, recent inventory trends reveal that some manufacturers may be edging toward overstocked territory as consumer demand shifts,\" Erin Keating, Cox Automotive executive analyst, said in a blog post Thursday, citing Jeep specifically.Jeep's comeback plan started with Stellantis CEO Antonio Filosa, who previously led the brand. It has accelerated, with the Filosa's support, under Broderdorf.\"It's not like '26 is going to be a 1-million-unit year because they're fixing things. Once you kind of get off track, getting back on track can take a little bit of time as well, but it starts with product,\" Brinley said. \"And that's what they have coming in 2026.\"",

Epstein did not explicitly accuse Trump of any wrongdoing or illegal activity in the email files.— CNBC's Emily Wilkins and Dan Mangan contributed to this report.Clarification: This story has been updated to clarify that reports indicate the vote is planned for Tuesday, but has not been officially scheduled.",

    "body": "Take-Two Interactive CEO Strauss Zelnick said on Monday that although gaming consoles are not going away, the industry is moving toward PCs in the next decade.\"I think it's moving towards PC and business is moving towards open rather than closed,\" Zelnick told CNBC's \"Squawk Box.\" \"But if you define console as the property, not the system, then the notion of a very rich game that you engage in for many hours that you play on a big screen — that's never going away.\"Zelnick said the current split between console and mobile is about even in the market, but mobile is growing more rapidly than consoles.Although gaming giants like Sony's PlayStation and Nintendo have remained focused on traditional consoles to major success, rivals like Microsoft's Xbox have hinted at more PC-based gaming for the next generation of hardware.\"It's kind of funny that people think about the console and PC as two different things,\" Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella recently said in an interview with TBPN. \"We built the console because we wanted to build a better PC, which could then perform for gaming. I kind of want to revisit some of that conventional wisdom.\"Gaming company Valve garnered significant buzz last week after announcing its new Steam Machine, a console-PC hybrid that can run PC games on a television or as a normal gaming computer.\"Expanding access across PC, console, and handheld devices reflects a future built on choice, core values that have guided Xbox's vision from the start,\" Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer wrote in an X post congratulating Valve.Read more CNBC tech newsDespite Coinbase departure, only 28 companies have left Delaware this yearThe question everyone in AI is asking: How long before a GPU depreciates?'Vibe revenue': AI companies admit they're worried about a bubbleWall Street cools on Oracle's buildout plans as debt concerns mount: 'AI sentiment is waning'Although Take-Two's most high-profile titles, such as its \"Grand Auto Theft\" and \"Borderlands\" series, are largely played through console and PC, the company has invested heavily in its mobile segment after the mobile gaming industry rocketed during the pandemic.In 2022, the company bought mobile developer Zynga for $12.7 billion, the largest gaming acquisition at the time.The lofty purchase has since paid off, with Take-Two's mobile division leading the company's revenue during the second quarter despite the release of notable titles including \"Borderlands 4,\" \"NBA 2K26\" and \"Mafia: The Old Country.\"Mobile games from developers like Zynga, Rollic and Nordeus accounted for 46% of Take-Two's net revenue during the quarter, while console sold slightly less at 41% and PC and other platforms contributed 13%.\"Mobile, of course, is taken with you, it's repeatable, and it's enjoyable,\" Zelnick said Monday. \"And I do think because it appeals to the broadest possible audience, it will probably continue to grow more rapidly.\"The CEO said during the earnings call that the company expected the mobile unit to increase by around 10% in the next quarter.Although mobile gaming slowed down after seeing unprecedented highs during Covid, the market is seeing some reacceleration this year.Global mobile game revenue is expected to generate $188.8 billion this year, increasing 3.4% from last year, according to research from Newzoo.

    "body": "Jeffrey Gundlach, CEO of DoubleLine Capital LP, speaks during an interview with CNBC on the floor at the New York Stock Exchange in New York City, U.S., May 7, 2025.Brendan McDermid | ReutersWall Street veteran Jeffrey Gundlach said many assets are extremely overpriced right now, urging investors to keep about 20% of their portfolios in cash to protect against a major downturn.Speaking on Bloomberg's Odd Lots podcast released Monday, the DoubleLine Capital CEO warned that the stock market looks dangerously speculative, saying it's among the least healthy he's seen in his entire career. The Dartmouth grad, who started his Wall Street career in the mid-1980s at TCW Group, today sees speculative excess in AI-related stocks and data-center investments, cautioning that momentum investing during a boom can end badly.Gundlach said he is especially worried about the rapid growth of private credit, a $1.7 trillion market that lends directly to companies. He said lenders are making \"garbage loans\" similar to what happened before the 2008 mortgage crisis, pointing to recent failures like auto lender Tricolor and car parts supplier First Brands Group as early warning signs.\"The next big crisis in the financial markets is going to be private credit,\" he said. \"It has the same trappings as subprime mortgage repackaging had back in 2006.\"Gundlach also criticized the push to sell private credit funds to retail investors, calling it a \"perfect mismatch\" where there's a promise for easy withdrawals despite the fact those assets can't typically be sold quickly. If investors pull money out, funds may be forced to sell at steep losses, he said.Despite his warnings, Gundlach admits it's hard to profit directly from this view. He won't short junk bonds, for example, because the trade keeps losing money, he said.He said he still likes gold but has reduced his recommended allocation to 15%. Gundlach had recommended a 25% gold position in mid-September, based on his belief that inflation would stay stubbornly elevated because of the impact of tariffs on import prices.",

    "body": "watch nowActor-entrepreneur Mark Wahlberg paid $37 million for a fully furnished mansion in Delray Beach, Florida, last month. The deal piqued interest and prompted coverage from TMZ to Architectural Digest, with most of the focus on the celebrity buyer.But aside from the name recognition, the home's skyrocketing price over the past five years also makes it stand out.The actor's transaction in October marks the home's fourth sale in that same time period, and a dramatic 118% price increase from its sale in January 2020 when the fully furnished mansion traded for $17 million.The grand entrance to the almost 17,800 sq ft estate known as Palazzo di Lago.Daniel PetroniThe estate, located at 9200 Rockybrook Way, saw a rise in value that outpaced not just the local market, but also many of the top luxury markets in America.In Delray Beach, the average sale price for a single-family luxury home, represented by the top 10% of closed sales, rose by just over 78%; Los Angeles was up 30%; the Hamptons rose 44%; and Manhattan increased just 4.5% according to Elliman Report data from the first quarter of 2020 to the third quarter of 2025.The home's steep rise in value even outperformed the S&P 500, which was up about 100% over the same time period.One mansion, four salesThe massive resort-style pool in the backyard is flanked by adult palms, a jumbo chess set, fire features, and a waterfall with a grotto below and a hot tub on top.Daniel PetroniRemarkably, the residence has traded hands four times since 2020. Just one real estate broker represented the listing in all four transactions, making the soaring value of the seven-bedroom, 10-bath mansion even more unique.Back in 2020, Douglas Elliman real estate broker Senada Adzem represented the original owners of 9200 Rockybrook, when the house was known as the Sundara estate. Three years later, Adzem represented the mansion's second owners who listed the home again, when it sold for $26 million, up 53% in just three years.A little over a year after buying the place, public records show a trust connected to William Cafaro, the co-president of a retail property development company in Niles, Ohio, and the home's third resident decided to sell. Adzem was once again the listing agent.This transaction was more unusual. Cafaro sold the home as part of a larger $50.5 million deal to purchase a Ferrari-inspired mansion less than half mile up the road in Stone Creek Ranch. Casa Maranello, as it's known, was being sold by local developer Aldo Stark, of Prestige Design Homes, with Adzem as the listing agent.Cafaro paid for the new home with $24.5 million in cash, plus the deed to 9200 Rockybrook Way, which was valued in the deal at the same price he'd paid for it: $26 million. When that sale closed in January 2025, Stark became the fourth owner of the mansion and he immediately started a dramatic multimillion-dollar renovation of the almost 17,800-square-foot megahome. He scrapped the old Sundara name and clad the home's old sheet-rocked walls in polished rare stones and bold high-gloss Guyana wood from Brazil.A side-by-side before and after of the foyer's grand staircase. Stark added a 30-ft tall vegetation wall and finished the adjacent walls in high-gloss Brazilian wood.He installed vibrant green vegetation above a grand stairway and into the ceilings.Stark completely reimagined everything from the kitchen to the clubroom and filled the residence with bespoke furniture.The kitchen before.Daniel PetroniThe kitchen after. The new-look includes counters clad in Orobico Grigio marble, floor-to-ceiling walnut cabinetry, vegetation accents in the ceiling and 30 tear-drop shaped light fixtures.And about two moths after closing, the megahome was listed for sale for a fourth time.  Reemerging with a new look, new name and a new price tag, one of the few things to remain the same was that Adzem was once again the listing agent.  The lounge bar before.Daniel PetroniThe lounge bar after.Daniel PetroniThe home, now called Palazzo di Lago, debuted with an ambitious $45 million asking price, $19 million more than what Stark paid for it two months earlier and 165% more than what it sold for in 2020.By October Adzem closed the fourth deal and delivered Palazzo di Lago to its fifth owner, who the buyer's broker, Michael Costello of Compass, confirmed to CNBC was Mark Wahlberg.One of the mansion's two home offices clad in great wave marble.Daniel PetroniAccording to Florida's Multiple Listing Service, the fully furnished mansion closed at $37 million, $11 million more than what Stark bought it for seven months earlier, and up 118% from its 2020 sale. And Adzem pulled off an uncommon feat in real estate, selling the same house four times in five years in transactions totaling $106 million.Primary bedroomDaniel PetroniFive owners across five years seems like an unusually high turnover rate, but Adzem has a simple explanation.\"People's circumstances change and they have different chapters in their life. So we were privileged to be able to guide this home through different evolutions and different owners and be able to add value to it,\" Adzem said.According to Adzem, the mansion's remarkable appreciation was fueled by a multitude of factors. Here are the top five:1. The pandemicAdzem attributed a large part of the 53% rise in price from 2020 to 2023 to the pandemic, which made demand and prices for homes in South Florida surge.\"After Covid, our market definitely accelerated,\" she told CNBC.Her walk-in closet is Chanel-boutique inspiredDaniel Petroni2. The 'micro-market'Some of the other market dynamics driving the price of Palazzo di Lago are unique to Stone Creek Ranch, which Adzem described as a luxury \"micro-market.\"The exclusive gated community spans about 187 acres with 37 luxury homes each on about 2.5 acre lots. It's a tight supply that's seen pricing dramatically impacted by a wave of new construction homes that have traded at record-breaking prices. Those recent comps helped push the price of Palazzo di Lago higher.Even the price of dirt in Stone Creek Ranch is on a steep rise. Back in 2013, the empty lot at 9200 Rockybrook Way traded for $800,000. In 2021, Adzem sold a comparable 2.5-acre lot for $1.7 million.\"The last one they traded was $6 million,\" Adzem told CNBC. \"However ... there are no vacant lots left in this community.\"And Adzem believes a more than threefold rise in the price of dirt here is just the beginning. She points to the fact that 2.5-acre lots worthy of a megahome are hard to come by in Palm Beach County, and the dwindling supply in this neighborhood in particular will push lot prices even higher. \"I feel like the dirt is going to double because the only upcoming potential sales would be teardowns.\"His closet takes inspiration from Tom Ford.Daniel Petroni3. The power of VIP neighborsAnother market driver: the tiny community's growing list of VIP owners.In 2021, billionaire hedge fund manager and owner of the New York Mets, Steve Cohen purchased the home next door to 9200 Rockybrook Way for about $22 million, according to MLS.\"[Potential buyers] typically do look to know who else owns in the community. That's important to them,\" Adzem said. Rich and famous residents can create a halo effect and make nearby real estate more desirable to potential buyers. And there's no shortage of ultra-high-net-worth neighbors living nearby, including several present and former CEOs of Fortune 500 companies, a former NFL player, and a pop star, according to Adzem and public records.And now some might even see Walhberg's new ownership as adding to the community's allure. Meanwhile, developer Stark just finished construction and recently moved into his own 32,000-square-foot mansion.Daniel Petroni4. Wealth migrationWealthy buyers looking to escape the tax burdens of their home states continue to see the tax advantages offered in Florida as a big draw and that helps drive and sustain demand.\"We saw a big influx and continued influx of buyers from California, from New York, from Connecticut, and they want what you see here,\" Adzem told CNBC.  The open-concept kitchen flows into a family room with faux vegetation that accents the ceiling.Daniel Petroni5. The multimillion-dollar renovationAdzem also credited Stark's renovation with adding to the estate's value.\"He didn't go neutral and he didn't go very light with color scheme. He really wanted to make an impact and put his own taste here,\" Adzem said.Adzem and Stark would only characterize the expense as \"a multimillion-dollar renovation,\" so it's unclear exactly how much it took to turn a home built in 2017 into the new Palazzo di Lago.But Adzem told CNBC the dramatic renovation and the new \"James-Bond-inspired vibe\" were the final catalysts that delivered a buyer willing to pay a premium.Correction: William Cafaro paid for the new home with $24.5 million in cash. A previous version of this story omitted the million. The price of the home rose 53% from 2020 to 2023. An earlier version misstated the percentage.",

    "body": "With approximately 250 million unique monthly visitors, Zillow is the most widely used real estate portal in the United States. It's among just a handful of online real estate platforms that transformed the way Americans buy, sell and rent homes.The company offers a free mobile and web app that provides significant detail on approximately 165 million homes. In the past, these listing data were available only to real estate agents in the industry's Multiple Listing Services system.Zillow also offers innovative products like the \"Zestimate,\" a machine learning algorithm that approximates a home's value. The feature has a median error rate of 2% for active listings and 7.1% for off-market homes, according to Zillow.Zestimates may increase seller profits by 4.16%, according to a 2023 paper by researchers at New York University, because the tool allows sellers to be more patient and set higher prices, then wait for buyers who truly value the property.Zillow makes money by generating leads for real estate agents on the platform. If the agent converts that lead into a sale, Zillow takes a fee of up to 40% of the real estate commission. \"[The agent] will bid on a specific zip code to try and win a certain number of leads, and then it's on them to go and convert those leads into successful transactions and customers,\" said Nikhil Devnani, senior U.S. internet analyst at global equity and research firm Bernstein.The median U.S. home sold for $410,800 during the second quarter, according to data from the U.S. Census Bureau and Department of Housing and Urban Development. In the U.S., a buyer agent's commission traditionally accounts for 3% of the home's sale price, or approximately $12,324 based on that median price. Zillow's fee, in this scenario, would be about $4,930 — if the lead was generated with Zillow's tools.\"If we can help more of those transactions happen, then we participate in the revenue in that transaction and we make more money,\" said Zillow CEO Jeremy Wacksman in an interview with CNBC.In 2024, Zillow reported annual revenues of $2.2 billion. Residential real estate activity, including lead generation, accounted for 71% of its revenues. Zillow also has a mortgage financing business called \"Zillow Home Loans\" and a rental advertising business.Other online real estate portals and brokerages have criticized Zillow's strong position in the industry.Competing real estate firm Compass filed a lawsuit against Zillow challenging its listing standards, which require sellers to list homes on Zillow within one business day of them appearing on the industry's MLS system — or risk not being able to list it at all on Zillow.\"They're banning any agent and their seller who doesn't list on Zillow in 24 hours. It's like Amazon saying if you don't give me your listing so I can monetize it and sell it for a 40% referral fee, I'm going to ban you,\" said Compass CEO Robert Reffkin on CNBC's \"Squawk on the Street\" in July.Zillow and Compass will meet in court to present evidence for a preliminary injunction this month. Zillow, in a September note to real estate professionals, reiterated that if a property is marketed to some buyers, it should be marketed to all buyers.In September, the Federal Trade Commission filed an antitrust lawsuit against Zillow and one of its competitors, Redfin, over a partnership the companies struck earlier this year.The companies had agreed to syndicate Zillow's rental advertising on Redfin.com. Zillow paid Redfin $100 million in the agreement, and Redfin later terminated its multifamily advertising division and laid off sales employees in that division.In October, five state attorneys general filed a similar lawsuit, alleging that the agreement would result in an \"almost total consolidation\" in the rental listing market, which could lead to higher prices for apartment owners.\"Those apartment owners will then try to pass those costs on to the average renter,\" said Arizona Attorney General Kris Mayes in an interview with CNBC.In response to the FTC and state attorneys general complaints, Zillow said it is elevating fee transparency and investing in tools to streamline and defragment renting for both renters and housing providers. A spokesperson for Redfin said the company disagrees with the FTC's allegations and that the existing number of Redfin advertising customers couldn't justify the cost of maintaining their rentals sales force.Watch the video above to learn how Zillow makes money.",

    "body": "Joe TerranovaScott Mlyn | CNBCJoe Terranova plans to stick by the winning quantitative approach that's allowed his Virtus Terranova U.S. Quality Momentum ETF (JOET) to identify stocks like Palantir early before the rest of the market has piled in over the last five years.The ETF — created by Terranova, chief market strategist for Virtus Investment Partners — has risen 10.9% this year, beating the 6.8% gain in the Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF (RSP) in that time.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconJOET, RSP YTD chartTo select the ETF's holdings, Terranova follows a strict set of rules-based principles. First, he and his team screen the 500 largest U.S. companies for stocks with the highest positive momentum, calculated using their total returns over 12 months. The top 250 stocks are then included in the selection list.The securities are then graded on three quality factors — return on equity, debt-to-equity ratio and annualized sales growth rate over the past three years. The top 125 stocks with the highest composite scores make up the equal-weighted ETF's holdings.Although the fund isn't actively managed in a traditional sense, it is rebalanced every quarter. Terranova said he doesn't miss the emotions of actively managing a fund, since his rules-based strategy has helped him capture alpha that he otherwise might have missed.\"In January of '24, Palantir qualified. Wasn't in the S&P at this point, because we're not scanning the S&P,\" Terranova said in the \"Quality in the Streets, Momentum in the Sheets\" episode of The Compound and Friends podcast with fellow CNBC contributor Josh Brown. \"I am telling you 100% I would have sold the stock if I had discretion six times over. I would have found six different times to sell that stock, the strategy, the discipline.\"Terranova estimated that he bought into Palantir while it was trading around $16.76. Shares of the analytics tools builder traded around $173 on Monday and have soared 129% in 2025.The investor also thanked his approach for capturing the market's \"personality\" and helping him get in early on other themes, like the current healthcare rally. On the flip side, Terranova's strategy has also helped him sell out of positions that he otherwise might have grown attached to.\"I have more affection towards the holdings that have been there for multiple quarters,\" he told CNBC on the sidelines of the podcast episode recording. \"Tesla's a great example. Tesla's revenue growth flattened out, and I could see what was coming — that we were going to sell Tesla. And on Halloween, the strategy liquidated Tesla, which looks like a pretty good move.\"Going forward, Terranova intends to build a suite of ETF products that applies his investing rules to other assets outside of U.S. large-cap stocks, such as small-caps and European equities. He believes his strategy will continue to succeed in allowing him to create a core equity holding and shock absorber for investors' portfolios.\"Momentum is a reflection of technical confidence. Quality is a reflection of fundamental confidence. And you want to invest around the confidence,\" Terranova said to CNBC. \"To me, that's where you get the long-term success.\"The JOET fund has an expense ratio of 0.29% and has around $240 million in assets under management.",

    "body": "Boxes of Ozempic and Wegovy made by Novo Nordisk at a pharmacy in London on March 8, 2024.Hollie Adams | ReutersNovo Nordisk on Monday said it has cut the direct-to-consumer prices of its blockbuster weight loss drug Wegovy and diabetes counterpart Ozempic, adding to efforts by the company and the Trump administration to make the treatments more accessible. The Danish drugmaker is lowering the price of the drugs for existing cash-paying patients to $349 per month from $499 per month. But Novo Nordisk said the cash-pay cost of the highest dose of Ozempic will remain $499 per month. Also on Monday, Novo Nordisk launched a temporary introductory offer, which will allow new cash-paying patients to access the two lowest doses of Wegovy and Ozempic for $199 per month for the first two months of treatment. After that period, people move to the new standard monthly direct-to-consumer price. The company's introductory offer ends on March 31. The announcements come days after President Donald Trump struck deals with Novo Nordisk and chief rival Eli Lilly to make their popular GLP-1 drugs easier for Americans to access and afford. Those agreements will involve cutting the prices the government pays for the drugs, introducing Medicare coverage of obesity drugs for the first time for certain patients and offering discounted medicines on the government's new direct-to-consumer website launching in January called TrumpRx. More CNBC health coverageThe Trump administration is changing Covid, childhood vaccine recommendations – here's what it means for youU.S. to impose 100% tariff on branded, patented drugs unless firms build plants locally, Trump saysEli Lilly to build $6.5 billion Texas manufacturing facility for obesity pill, other drugs\"Our new savings offers provide immediate impact, bringing forward greater cost savings for those who are currently without coverage or choose to self-pay,\" said Dave Moore, Novo Nordisk's head of U.S. operations, said in a release. \"It is part of a larger strategy to expand access that includes building relationships with telehealth providers and major retailers, expanding coverage, and working with the Administration to lower costs for people living with chronic diseases like obesity.\"The Trump administration said starting doses of existing injections like Wegovy and Eli Lilly's weight loss drug Zepbound will be $350 per month on TrumpRx, but will \"trend down\" to $245 per month over a two-year period. On the day the deals were announced, Eli Lilly said it would lower prices by $50 on its own direct-to-consumer platform, LillyDirect, which already offers Zepbound at a discount to cash-paying patients. The multidose pen of Zepbound will be available at $299 per month at the lowest dose, with additional doses being priced up to $449 per month.Novo Nordisk's new cash-pay offers are available through Wegovy.com or Ozempic.com, the company's direct-to-consumer pharmacy, NovoCare, and other participating organizations and telehealth providers that work directly with the drugmaker, including Costco, GoodRx, WeightWatchers, Ro, LifeMD and eMed. ",

    "body": "US President Donald Trump speaks during a Black History Month event in the East Room of the White House in Washington, DC, on Feb. 18, 2026. Saul Loeb | AFP | Getty ImagesPresident Donald Trump on Wednesday issued an executive order invoking the Defense Production Act to promote the domestic production of phosphorus and the weedkiller glyphosate, which he said is critical to both defense and food security.Glyphosate is often targeted by supporters of the Make America Healthy Again movement as a harmful chemical. Trump aligned with the MAHA movement after Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr. dropped out of the 2024 election.\"I find that ensuring robust domestic elemental phosphorus mining and United States-based production of glyphosate-based herbicides is central to American economic and national security,\" Trump said in the order. \"Without immediate Federal action, the United States remains inadequately equipped and vulnerable.\"Glyphosate has long been used in U.S. agriculture and has been the subject of controversy over alleged links to cancer. Bayer, the company that makes the glyphosate-based weedkiller Roundup, recently proposed paying $7.25 billion to settle lawsuits claiming the chemical causes cancer.Roundup products are seen for sale at a store in San Rafael, California.Josh Edelson | AFP | Getty ImagesPhosphorus, which is also covered in the order, is a precursor to the production of glyphosate and is also used in the manufacturing of certain military equipment. The order will require Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins to issue orders and regulations to implement the increased supply of phosphorus and glyphosate.A White House Fact sheet on the executive order said Trump signed it to \"ensure domestic production of elemental phosphorus and glyphosate-based herbicides, the loss of which would cripple critical supply chains.\"A lack of either chemical, the fact sheet said, could \"leave our defense industrial base and food supply vulnerable to hostile foreign actors,\" since there is only \"one domestic producer of elemental phosphorus and glyphosate-based herbicides.\"Kennedy once won a nearly $290 million case against Roundup producer Monsanto, which has since been bought by Bayer, for a man who alleged he developed cancer from using the weedkiller. Since being nominated as Trump's HHS chief, however, he has softened his tone on the chemical. \"We cannot take any step that will put a single farmer in this country out of business,\" he said during a hearing last year. \"There's a million farmers who rely on glyphosate.\"CNBC has reached out to HHS for comment. Monsanto said in a statement to CNBC that the executive order \"reinforces the critical need for U.S. farmers to have access to essential, domestically produced crop protection tools such as glyphosate.\"  \"We will comply with this order to produce glyphosate and elemental phosphorus,\" the company said.

    "body": "U.S. Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. speaks, announcing new nutrition policies during a press conference at the Department of Health and Human Services in Washington, D.C., U.S., Jan. 8, 2026.Jonathan Ernst | ReutersSecretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr. defended President Donald Trump's executive order spurring the domestic production of the weedkiller glyphosate, as his Make America Healthy Again movement reels from the president's embrace of the chemical they despise.Trump on Wednesday night signed an executive order invoking the Defense Production Act to compel the domestic production of elemental phosphorus and glyphosate-based herbicides. Glyphosate is the chemical in Bayer-Monsanto's Roundup and is the most commonly used weedkiller for a slew of U.S. crops. Trump, in the order, said shortages of both phosphorus and glyphosate would pose a risk to national security.Kennedy backed the president in a statement to CNBC Thursday morning. \"Donald Trump's Executive Order puts America first where it matters most — our defense readiness and our food supply,\" he said. \"We must safeguard America's national security first, because all of our priorities depend on it. When hostile actors control critical inputs, they weaken our security. By expanding domestic production, we close that gap and protect American families.\"But Kennedy's MAHA coalition that supported Trump in the 2024 presidential election hates glyphosate, which has been alleged to cause cancer in myriad lawsuits. Now, the executive order threatens to unravel that coalition ahead of the 2026 midterm elections that could loosen the president's grip on Washington. \"Just as the large MAHA base begins to consider what to do at midterms, the President issues an EO to expand domestic glyphosate production,\" Kelly Ryerson, a prominent MAHA activist known as Glyphosate Girl, said in a post on X. \"The very same carcinogenic pesticide that MAHA cares about most.\"Ken Cook, president of the Environmental Working Group, a watchdog that has pushed back against chemicals in food for years, said in a statement that he \"can't envision a bigger middle finger to every MAHA mom than this.\"\"Elevating glyphosate to a national security priority is the exact opposite of what MAHA voters were promised,\" Cook said. \"If Secretary Kennedy remains at HHS after this, it will be impossible to argue that his past warnings about glyphosate were anything more than campaign rhetoric designed to win trust — and votes.\"Kennedy, a former environmental attorney, notably once won a nearly $290 million case against Monsanto for a man who claimed his cancer was caused by Roundup. The executive order came down one day after Bayer proposed paying $7.25 billion to settle a series of lawsuits claiming Roundup causes cancer. Former Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., knocked Trump for signing \"an EO protecting cancer causing Glyphosate in our foods.\"Glyphosate is a critical chemical to American agriculture. It's applied to many key cash crops, such as corn and soybeans, and has been defended by agricultural trade organizations. Phosphorus is a key input to the creation of glyphosate, which the White House argues is necessary to maintain food security. Elemental phosphorus is also used in the manufacture of some military materials.\"Thank you, President Trump, for acknowledging the importance of glyphosate-based herbicides in American agriculture,\" the House Agriculture Committee said Wednesday night in an X post. \"This is a vital step forward in ensuring a domestic supply of this critical crop input remains available for our producers.\"House Agriculture Chair Rep. G.T. Thompson, R-Pa., is trying to push a farm bill through Congress this year — a legislative package that covers federal farm support and nutrition subsidies. He's also come under fire from MAHA recently for a provision in that bill that would block state and local pesticide regulations from differing from federal guidance.",

    "body": "Signs for Walmart (L) and Amazon.Getty ImagesFor the first time, Amazon has dethroned Walmart as the company with the largest annual revenue. Walmart on Thursday reported annual revenue of $713.2 billion for its most recent fiscal year, shy of Amazon's $716.9 billion in revenue. The milestone was brewing for months, as Amazon leapfrogged Walmart in quarterly sales for the first time about a year ago.The shuffle, while largely symbolic, underscores the battle the two retailers have waged both to define and keep up with ever-changing consumer preferences. They are kicking off a new chapter of that rivalry as artificial intelligence reshapes how companies operate, make money and drive sales. Amazon rose to the top of the revenue pile by doing much more than running a sprawling online webstore and promising speedy delivery. While its core retail unit is its largest revenue generator, its huge cloud computing, advertising and seller services businesses also fuel its sales. Third-party seller services, which include commissions and fees collected by Amazon fulfillment along with shipping, advertising and customer support, accounted for about 24% of the company's total sales in 2025, according to its latest annual filing. Amazon Web Services was responsible for roughly 18%.It wasn't Walmart's weakness that led it to lose its top spot, as its revenue has more than doubled in 20 years. The retailer has leaned on its more than 4,600 Walmart stores and roughly 600 Sam's Club locations in the U.S. to power its digital business, which grew by 27% in the U.S. in the fiscal fourth quarter and has posted double-digit percentage gains for 15 straight quarters.That expansion came as Walmart riffed off the Amazon playbook and tried to position itself as a tech company as well as a retailer. There have been multiple signs of its ambitions: Walmart relisted its stock, moving from the New York Stock Exchange to the tech-heavy Nasdaq in early December. Its market value surpassed the $1 trillion mark earlier this month, a valuation achieved almost exclusively by tech companies including Amazon, after a more than 21% rise in the last year. And the big-box retailer's fourth-quarter earnings, which were boosted by digital advertising and its third-party marketplace, illustrated Walmart's emphasis on chasing higher-margin businesses and thinking beyond brick-and-mortar retail.Amazon and Walmart's AI ambitionsIn many ways, Walmart's recent push to grow its third-party marketplace was an answer to the dominance of Amazon's platform. Even as it tries to catch up with Amazon in some areas, Walmart is trying to gain an edge in a new frontier.Over the past few years, Amazon and Walmart have used different AI strategies to try to make their businesses more efficient and make their merchandise more appealing to shoppers.Walmart struck a deal with OpenAI's ChatGPT in October and Google's Gemini in January to make its products easier to discover and buy. It also has its own AI-powered shopping assistant, Sparky. The virtual assistant, which looks like a smiley face, pops up on Walmart's app and can help shoppers find items. Walmart, like many other companies, is in the early days of AI adoption, and it's unclear how the technology will affect its business long-term. On the company's earnings call on Thursday, Walmart CEO John Furner said customers are spending more when they use Sparky. He said customers who use Sparky have an average order value that's about 35% higher than shoppers who don't use the tool.About half of Walmart's app users have used Sparky, Walmart U.S. CEO David Guggina said on the earnings call.\"Agentic AI is increasingly embedded across Walmart,\" Guggina said. \"It's strengthening our operations. It's improving associate productivity, and it's enhancing the customer experience.\"Walmart CFO John David Rainey said AI investments are included in the retailer's capital expenditure plans for the full year, which are expected to be roughly 3.5% of sales. Those expenses also include the company's investments in automation and store remodels. There are limits to Walmart's tech ambitions. When it comes to AI, Rainey said Walmart will lean on the expertise of tech companies rather than try to create its own products.\"As you've seen from the announcements we've made, we're approaching AI development through partnerships,\" he said on the company's earnings call. \"This lets tech companies do what they do best, develop innovative technology, and it provides us clarity to do what we do best, to translate the best of tech to retail experiences that create value for our customers and members and our enterprise.\"Like Walmart, Amazon is also facing new pressure to respond to the rise of agentic commerce. Chatbot makers like OpenAI, Google and Perplexity have introduced automated commerce features that aim to change how people shop online. While other companies like Walmart, Etsy and Shopify have announced shopping partnerships with AI platforms, Amazon has remained on the sidelines. It's blocked agents from accessing its site, and doubled down on its own shopping chatbot, Rufus, which is powered by its own models and Anthropic's chatbot Claude.The company said Rufus has been used by more than 300 million customers and drove almost $12 billion in incremental annualized sales last year. After slowly rolling out the service in beta two years ago, Amazon has injected Rufus across more areas of its app and website to encourage shoppers to use the tool.Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said last month that Rufus and other AI tools could assist shoppers with finding products much like an employee in a physical store.\"I think agents are going to help customers with that type of discovery,\" Jassy said. \"And it's part of why we've invested so much in Rufus, which is our shopping assistant.\"Meanwhile, Amazon is throwing piles of cash at AI infrastructure. Earlier this month, it announced it would spend up to $200 billion this year on AI initiatives, more than any of the other hyperscalers, which have altogether forecast nearly $700 billion in 2026 expenditures. Most of Amazon's spending is expected to go to data centers, chips and networking equipment.Wall Street has viewed Amazon's capex plans skeptically, sending the company's shares down for nine days straight following its Feb. 5 earnings report and shaving more than $450 billion off of its market value.Amazon's investments aren't limited to AI compute. The company has also put significant resources and talent behind developing AI tools across all of its businesses. It's also rolled out a suite of AI models, and revamped its Alexa assistant. It also has invested $8 billion in Anthropic since 2023.— CNBC's Robert Hum contributed to this report",

    "body": "Shares in Blue Owl Capital tumbled 8.7% on Thursday after the private market and alternative assets manager sold $1.4 billion of loan assets held across three of its private debt funds.Blue Owl said Wednesday it had agreed the sale with four North American pension and insurance investors, with the loans changing hands at 99.7% of par value.The largest sale comes out of the Blue Owl Capital Corporation II fund, also known as OBDC II, a semi-liquid private credit strategy aimed at U.S. retail investors. OBDC II offloaded $600 million in loans, amounting to about 34% of its $1.7 billion portfolio.In a major switch, Blue Owl said that following the deal, OBDC II would end regular quarterly liquidity payments to the fund's investors.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconBlue Owl.Instead, the business development company — which specializes in private credit lending to U.S. middle-market companies — will pivot to periodic payouts that will be funded by asset sales, earnings, repayments and other strategic deals.That shift more tightly restricts investor liquidity and their ability to withdraw their money. The move underlines the challenges surrounding liquidity and transparency in private markets, amid the ongoing push by private asset managers and alternative investment funds into the more liquid retail wealth space.It follows a recent rise in redemption requests in some of Blue Owl's business development companies, according to a Bloomberg report.Last November, Blue Owl Capital attempted to merge OBDC II with the larger, publicly-traded Blue Owl Capital Corporation (OBDC) fund. Before abandoning its plans, Blue Owl halted redemptions in OBDC II until the deal — which could have brought losses of some 20% to investors — was completed. The episode rattled investors, sending Blue Owl Capital's shares lower.Now, Blue Owl will use the proceeds from this sale to pay down debt and return capital to OBDC II shareholders, at up to $2.35 per share or approximately 30% of OBDC II's net asset value.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconBlue Owl Capital Corporation (OBDC).Elsewhere, the other funds — the OBDC and Blue Owl Technology Income Corp (OTIC) — each sold $400 million in assets, representing 2% and 6% of their respective portfolios.\"These sales consist of 97% senior secured debt investments with an average size of $5 million and include investments in 128 distinct portfolio companies across 27 industries,\" Blue Owl said in a statement.\"The largest industry represented is internet software and services at 13%, generally consistent with the industry composition of Blue Owl's overall direct lending strategy and reflecting continued confidence in the quality and valuations of these software investments.\"Logan Nicholson, president of OBDC II and OBDC, said the deal \"opportunistically\" delivers value to shareholders and, in OBDC II, provides a \"significant liquidity event\" while maintaining a diversified portfolio with strong earnings potential.",

    "body": "Andrew Mountbatten Windsor, younger brother of Britain’s King Charles, formerly known as Prince Andrew, leaves Aylsham Police Station on a vehicle, on the day he was arrested on suspicion of misconduct in public office, after the U.S. Justice Department released more records tied to the late financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, in Aylsham, Britain, Feb. 19, 2026. Phil Noble | ReutersBritish police on Thursday released Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, the former prince and brother of King Charles III, after having arrested him earlier on suspicion of misconduct in public office.The nature of the investigation has not been revealed. But Mountbatten-Windsor's arrest came after renewed focus on his past friendship with Jeffrey Epstein, the now-dead, notorious sex offender, after the U.S. Department of Justice released millions of documents about Epstein.Thames Valley Police, who had arrested Mountbatten-Windsor without publicly identifying him, had said they were assessing reports that he had sent Epstein confidential trade reports in 2010, when he was Britain's special envoy for international trade.Thames Valley Police, in a statement, said, \"On Thursday ... we arrested a man in his sixties from Norfolk on suspicion of misconduct in public office.\"\"The arrested man has now been released under investigation,\" police said. \"We can also confirm that our searches in Norfolk have now concluded. Our searches in Berkshire are still underway.\"King Charles, in a statement earlier Thursday following the arrest of his brother, said, \"I have learned with the deepest concern the news about Andrew  Mountbatten-Windsor and suspicion of misconduct in public office.\"\"What now follows is the full, fair and proper process by which this issue is investigated in the appropriate manner and by the appropriate  authorities,\" the king said. \"Let me state clearly: the law must take its course.\"President Donald Trump, speaking to reporters on Air Force One on Thursday, called Mountbatten-Windsor's arrest \"a shame.\"\"I think it's very sad. I think it's so bad for the royal family. It's very, very sad. To me, it's a very sad thing,\" said Trump, who himself is a former friend of Epstein.Charles, in October, stripped Mountbatten-Windsor of his title of prince and forced him out of his home by Windsor Castle because of his ties to Epstein, who killed himself in August 2019 after being arrested on federal child sex trafficking charges filed in New York.Mountbatten-Windsor has denied any wrongdoing in connection with Epstein.",

You know how we feel about this. We do not accept anything like this,\" Putin said on Wednesday during a meeting with Cuban Foreign Minister Bruno Rodríguez Parrilla, according to Russian news agency Tass. Russia, which has been allied to Cuba for decades, has recently described Havana's fuel situation as \"truly critical\" and said it is actively discussing what help it can provide to the country.\"We have always been on Cuba's side in its struggle for independence, for the right to follow its own path of development, and we have always supported the Cuban people,\" Putin said.\"We know how difficult these past decades have been for the Cuban people as they have fought for the right to live by their own rules and defend their national interests,\" he added.Read moreThe U.S. has effectively cut Cuba off from Venezuelan oil since launching an extraordinary military operation to depose Venezuela President Nicolás Maduro on Jan. 3.

    "body": "A \"Now Hiring\" sign is seen at an AutoZone on Feb. 11, 2026 in Hollywood, Florida. Joe Raedle | Getty ImagesWith the upheaval of the Covid pandemic came opportunity, as a shift in the labor market gave workers unprecedented opportunities for mobility and a chance to climb the pay scale.The Great Resignation, as it came to be known, saw record amounts of employees quit, leaving for better opportunities as companies couldn't hire workers fast enough to fill the vacancies that the pandemic helped create. A record 4.5 million left their jobs for greener pastures in March 2022. But that is changing.The level of \"quits\" as measured by the Bureau of Labor Statistics has contracted by nearly one-third since hitting its peak in early 2022, a period during which job openings have nearly halved. One metric helps further tell the story: During the same period, the disparity between average annual pay increases for those staying in their jobs against those leaving has all but collapsed, going from a peak of 8.4 percentage points in April 2022 to 1.9 percentage points in January, the lowest level since payrolls processing firm ADP began tracking the data in November 2020.Call it the Big Stay, or just another outgrowth of the low-hire, low-fire labor market, but it's a trend that has significance for workers.A pendulum swing\"It's a very stable labor market. There's very little hiring, very little firing,\" said Nela Richardson, chief economist at ADP. \"It's an outgrowth of the pandemic from where it was all hands on deck.\"A lack of labor supply and a pernicious skills gap was the story when the economy was trying to recover from the massive drawdown it had seen during the early Covid days. Workers and employers were adjusting to the new world of hybrid work, and companies were hungry for new recruits.As the Great Resignation peaked, there were more than two job openings per each worker the BLS classified as unemployed. That pendulum has swung back, however, and there are now more available workers than openings.watch nowLayoffs, though, remain low. Last week saw just 206,000 initial jobless claims, with the longer-term average at 219,000, about in line with historical norms for a healthy labor market. Though hiring has slowed considerably, the unemployment rate is just 4.3%. \"if you were to parachute into this labor market in any time period of the United States, you'd be mostly happy with what you found,\" Richardson said. \"The action is in the granular data.\"For instance, pay trends are peculiar to industries. In the high-turnover leisure and hospitality industry, pay gains are better for job stayers, with the disparity at 2.5% in stayers' favor, according to ADP. However, construction, which is struggling with labor supply during the U.S. crackdown on illegal immigration, has a 6.6 percentage point advantage for switchers.To be sure, the incentives are still strong for switchers, with annual pay growth averaging 6.4% in January, well above the 4.5% for stayers, according to ADP data. But the gap is narrowing and could close further due to current labor market moves.A new realityThe trends come with a fresh flock of workers combing the want ads for jobs.Searches were up 31% in January from December while job postings were little changed, according to the Indeed Hiring Lab.\"The reality facing those seeking jobs in 2026 is that openings per unemployed person have declined, and hiring timelines are lengthening,\" Indeed experts Laura Ullrich and Sneha Puri wrote. \"While some sectors continue to see elevated levels of postings, the macro environment remains in the low-hire, low-fire stagnation of 2025.\"Even with the low unemployment rate, Richardson said she is concerned with the \"lack of dynamism in the labor market\" as most hires are in the health-care industry and turnover is receding.\"The fact that it is low-hire, low-fire is actually not a great state to be in. The churn is important to the productivity growth,\" she said. \"You want to see the most talented go to the places where that talent is the most rewarded. And if we are in this really stable period, that means that talent is not being repositioned to its best use.\"",

    "body": "Canadian filmmaker James Cameron poses during a photocall for the opening of the exhibition entitled 'The Art of James Cameron' at the Cinematheque Francaise in Paris on April 3, 2024.Stephane De Sakutin | AFP | Getty ImagesLegendary \"Titanic\" director James Cameron is likening the theatrical experience to a \"sinking ship\" if Netflix acquires Warner Bros. Discovery's film studio. Cameron penned a letter to Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, last week, which was obtained by CNBC, in which he argues Netflix's proposed acquisition of WBD's studio and streaming assets could lead to massive job losses in Hollywood, fundamentally alter the theatrical landscape in the U.S. and negatively impact one of America's largest export sectors.Lee chairs the Senate subcommittee on antitrust, competitive policy and consumer rights, which met in early February to discuss the potential impact of the Netflix-Warner Bros. transaction. Cameron sent his letter in the days following the hearing, during which Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos and WBD executive Bruce Campbell testified. \"I believe strongly that the proposed sale of Warner Brothers Discovery to Netflix will be disastrous for the theatrical motion picture business that I have dedicated my life's work to,\" Cameron wrote to Lee. \"Of course, my films all play in the downstream video markets as well, but my first love is the cinema.\"Cameron has been vocal in his opposition to the proposed tie-up, and his concerns echo those of the broader filmmaking industry, which generally sees combinations of movie studios resulting in fewer releases and less work. Cameron's letter to Lee, which has not been previously reported, escalates his concerns to the lawmakers who could potentially stand in the way of Netflix completing its acquisition. \"We have received outreach from actors, directors, and other interested parties about the proposed Netflix and Warner Brothers merger, and I share many of their concerns,\" Lee said in a statement. \"I look forward to holding a follow-up hearing to further address these issues.\"In response to a request for comment, a Netflix representative pointed to Netflix's written testimony and Sarandos' comments during the hearing earlier this month. In its written testimony, Netflix outlined its investments in the film and TV production industry and its impact on the overall U.S. economy, including $20 billion in planned film and TV spend in 2026, a majority of which it said will be spent in America. \"With this deal, we're going to increase, not reduce, production investments going forward, supported by a stronger combined business and balance sheet,\" Netflix said, noting its production facilities, such as in New Mexico and an upcoming New Jersey-based studio. Since the deal's announcement, Netflix's top brass has consistently voiced their belief that the deal would not only win regulatory approval, but would be good for the media industry.During a recent earnings call, Sarandos called the deal \"pro-consumer ... pro-innovation, pro-worker.\"He has said on multiple occasions that the addition of WBD's studio would preserve jobs — even as layoffs roil the media ecosystem — and has said the assets would bring new businesses under Netflix's umbrella.\"We're going to need those teams, these folks that have extensive experience and expertise. We want them to stay on and run those business,\" Sarandos said. \"So we're expanding content creation, not collapsing it in this transaction.\"In addition to concerns specific to filmmakers and across the theater industry, the proposed Netflix-WBD transaction has awakened other regulatory questions. In particular, critics have raised alarm about bringing together two of the top global streaming services – Netflix with 325 million global subscribers and WBD's HBO Max with 128 million as of Sept. 30. Lawmakers have already questioned how a merger of those services would impact consumers and prices.Paramount Skydance has leveraged some of the same arguments in its attempt to unseat Netflix and buy the entirety of WBD through a hostile tender offer. Sarandos and co-CEO Greg Peters have argued competition for viewers includes various platforms – from traditional TV to streaming services to social media platforms like YouTube – making Netflix a small part of the ecosystem.watch nowTheatrical shiftsCameron, who has pioneered the creation of new filming technologies during his decades-long career, including 3D production systems, advanced visual effects and high-frame-rate display, noted that theatrical exhibition has been a critical part of his \"creative vision.\"He also highlighted previous comments by Sarandos calling movie theaters \"an outdated concept\" and an \"outmoded idea,\" in addition to comments telling investors that \"driving folks to a theater is just not our business.\"\"The business model of Netflix is directly at odds with the theatrical film production and exhibition business, which employs hundreds of thousands of Americans,\" Cameron wrote. \"It is therefore directly at odds with the business model of the Warner Brothers movie division, one of the few remaining major movie studios.\"Cameron noted that WBD releases around 15 theatrical films a year, volume that movie theater operators rely on at a time when production has shrunk and consumer habits have shifted.He also suggested that the merger would \"remove consumer choice by reducing the number of feature motion pictures that are made\" as well as \"restrict the choices of film-makers looking for studios to invest in their projects, which will in turn reduce jobs.\"Cameron touched on recent trade policy shifts by the Trump administration that have sought to protect U.S. exports. President Donald Trump has more than once floated the idea of tariffs to protect Hollywood. \"The US may no longer lead in auto or steel manufacturing, but it is still the world leader in movies,\" Cameron said. Under a Netflix-WBD merger, \"That will change for the worse.\"Cameron also questioned whether Netflix would honor verbal commitments its executives have made around future theatrical releases, including how long they would play in theaters and how many theaters they would play in. In its written testimony from earlier this month, Netflix said it plans to put Warner Bros. films in theaters with 45-day windows and would continue to employ these employees, since \"we don't have those kinds of workers at Netflix today.\" \"We are not acquiring these amazing assets to shut them down, but to build them up,\" according to the testimony.Still, Cameron questioned whether those commitments would hold. \"Their pledge to support theatrical releases (a business fundamentally at odds with their core business model) is likely to evaporate in a few years,\" he said. \"Once they own a major movie studio, that is irrevocable,\" he added. \"That ship has sailed (as I like to say, mindful that I directed 'Titanic.' I am very familiar not only with ships that sail, but also those that sink. And the theatrical experience of movies could become a sinking ship.)\"",

    "body": "watch nowNew Balance sales grew 19% last year to $9.2 billion as the legacy sneaker giant continued to outperform the global footwear market and take share from floundering competitors like Nike.The 120-year-old Boston-based footwear brand, which is private, exclusively shared its 2025 results with CNBC. In addition to the sharp 2025 growth, the retailer said it could reach its goal of $10 billion in annual revenue by the end of the year.\"We're competitive. No question about it. But we want to make sure that as we get there and surpass it, that the quality of our business is first and foremost,\" CEO Joe Preston told CNBC in an interview. \"We don't want empty calories here. We want to make sure that we are delivering upon the premise that we have, which is to become a premium brand. Over the past five years, we've done exactly that around the globe.\" Jeremy Moeller | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesSince 2020, New Balance has grown sales by a staggering 180%, placing it among a handful of standout competitors that supersized their businesses as Nike changed its business model and lost significant market share.During the Covid-19 pandemic, Nike doubled down on its direct selling strategy that cut off longtime wholesale suppliers so the sneaker giant could grow through its own website and stores. While the strategy briefly boosted sales and promised higher margins, it opened up critical shelf space at strategic retailers that companies like New Balance, Brooks Running, On and Deckers rushed to fill. With so much focus on building out a direct selling model, which can be more complex than distributing to wholesalers, Nike also fell behind on innovation and lost its edge in the performance footwear market. That created further opportunity for competitors like New Balance. Nike's former CEO, John Donahoe, previously blamed remote work during the pandemic for the retailer's innovation slowdown, but Preston said the global crisis created an opportunity for his team to come together in ways they hadn't previously to implement new strategies. \"We met every Tuesday morning at 7:30 a.m., we still have that meeting weekly today, and it allowed us to get on a global offense … we came out of Covid stronger than any other company in our industry,\" said Preston. \"The marketplace disruption that's been taking place, the examples of Nike, sure, all that stuff is real and at the same time, I don't think it's the reason that we have begun to emerge.\" Preston said the company has stood apart from competitors and taken market share by focusing on \"staying in front of the consumer\" and how, when and where people want to shop. The chief executive said New Balance's growth came across a range of regions and categories, and was fueled by an aggressive store-opening plan that saw 80 new doors opened in 2025 alone. While they are a critical revenue driver, store openings are costly and take time to show a return. When asked, New Balance declined to share details about its profitability, so it's unclear how much these investments are weighing on its bottom line, and whether it'll be able to keep up the high growth it has enjoyed.To build up its business after more than 100 years on the market, New Balance took a few cues out of Nike's playbook. The company said a key driver of its growth has been its ability to position itself as a premium brand, which was critical to Nike's ability to become a roughly $50 billion powerhouse.That has meant New Balance being selective with both distribution and discounting. The move has allowed it to increase its average selling price by about 30% over the last five years at a time when many competitors have had to lean on promotions to drive sales.There was also some good timing at play, too. Coming out of the Covid-19 pandemic, New Balance leaned on its heritage as a 1990s \"dad shoe\" when styles from the '90s were extremely popular with younger shoppers. That allowed it to win over a younger consumer base that didn't grow up with the shoes and shoppers who chose sneakers as a fashion statement – not just for sports or working out. At the same time, it partnered with key athletes, including Los Angeles Dodgers two-way superstar Shohei Ohtani, tennis star Coco Gauff and Buffalo Bills quarterback Josh Allen, which has fueled growth in its performance footwear business. For the year ahead, New Balance said it plans to grow its existing product lines, build out new products and put a bigger emphasis on performance sales. It also wants to continue growing its direct-to-consumer sales through store openings in strategic areas. While the direct selling strategy didn't go so well for Nike, Preston said he's taking a different approach. \"One of the things we're not doing is establishing a [DTC] target internally,\" said Preston. \"We want to make sure that our goal is to show up the best and not have it be the biggest part of our business. I don't want to get in the way with how the consumer wants to shop. We want to make sure that we are enabling the consumer to shop how they want to shop. We just want to show up great.\" ",

Abigail Spanberger will deliver the Democratic rebuttal to President Donald Trump's State of the Union address next Tuesday, a primetime slot for the newly elected state executive to lay out the Democratic Party's vision ahead of the pivotal 2026 midterm elections. Spanberger defeated Republican Winsome Earl-Sears by 15 points in last year's elections, flipping the state from Republican to Democratic control. She was previously a member of the House of Representatives from Virginia.The rebuttal to the State of the Union is a high-stakes opportunity for the party outside of the White House to lay out its vision for the country after the president gives his speech. The stakes are even higher for Democrats this year, who are looking to rip away Trump's complete control of Washington in the midterm elections. \"Virginians and Americans across the country are contending with rising costs, chaos in their communities, and a real fear of what each day might bring,\" Spanberger said in a statement announcing her speech. \"Next week, I look forward to laying out what these Americans expect and deserve — leaders who are working hard to deliver for them.\"House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., said in a statement that Spanberger \"stands in stark contrast to Donald Trump, who will lie, deflect and blame everyone but himself for his failed presidency on Tuesday evening.\"And Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said she will \"lay out a clear path forward: lower everyday costs, protect healthcare, and defend the freedoms that define who we are as a nation.\"Sen. Elissa Slotkin, D-Mich., gave the rebuttal to Trump's joint session of Congress last year. The last time a governor gave the rebuttal was in 2022 when Republican Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds spoke following President Joe Biden's State of the Union address.",

    "body": "watch nowNo United Airlines credit card? Soon you'll earn fewer miles than other travelers.United is overhauling its MileagePlus frequent flyer program to reward travelers with more miles and lower redemption rates, including for some of its long-haul business-class seats — if they have one of the airline's credit cards. It's the latest move by an airline to reward its highest-spending customers.The changes mark the biggest shake-up to the lucrative program in more than a decade, when United began rewarding customers for how much they spent — not just how far they flew.United Chief Commercial Officer Andrew Nocella told CNBC in an interview that the airline has been working on the changes for about 18 months and that the carrier is aiming to reward its most loyal customers.The shift also comes as United tries to stand out in an ever more competitive landscape for travel and rewards credit cards. That space also includes American Express' Platinum, Capital One's Venture X and Chase's Sapphire Reserve cards. United Airlines planes are taxiing to takeoff from San Francisco International Airport.Tayfun Coskun | Anadolu | Getty Images\"In the credit card space in general, a lot's changed over the last five to 10 years in terms of the number of travel credit cards that are out there,\" Nocella said. \"What I'm thinking about as we make these changes for United is to make sure that if you hold the credit card, you put it top of wallet, and then if you don't hold the credit card, there's a reason to get the credit card that seems incredibly compelling if you'd like to fly United Airlines and if you'd like to have that ... trip to Tahiti or to Rome or wherever we may be able to take you.\"The changes take effect April 2. United is planning to show the discounted award flights on its website \"so customers can see exactly how much having a United card could save them on their travel,\" the airline said.United's loyalty program update is part of a trend among airlines to reward frequent flyer program members depending on how much they spend. About a decade ago, the major carriers tweaked their loyalty programs to reward customers for dollars spent over miles traveled.Airlines also encourage customers to sign up for their credit cards by offering perks like no fees for checked bags and earlier boarding.What's changing with United MileagePlus United MileagePlus primary cardholders will get more miles per dollar spent on United flights compared with customers without a card, and higher rates than they do currently. Their earning goes up, too, when they actually use that card to purchase the ticket.Meanwhile, customers without the card will earn less than they do today. For example, a traveler without a co-branded United Airlines credit card will get three miles per dollar spent on a ticket, down from the current five miles. Under the new structure, a cardholder could earn six miles, and more if they use the card to buy it. Those with elite MileagePlus status earn miles at a higher rate, too.United debit cardholders will also receive more miles, once they spend $10,000, United said.Redemption rate discounts for cardholders United will also now allow customers with one of its credit cards to redeem their miles for flights at a discount of at least 10% compared with those without the card.The carrier said that, as an example, an economy-class award ticket that was 15,000 miles will go for 13,500 without elite Premier status. United said it's setting aside special discounted inventory of award tickets for cardholders, including for top-tier Polaris seats.Read more CNBC airline newsSpirit Airlines sells more planes, calls back 500 flight attendants from furlough ahead of spring breakFAA abruptly halted El Paso flights over Defense Department’s plans for anti-drone technologyPressure mounts on American Airlines CEO as carrier lags rivalsSouthwest ends open seating after 54 years. Here’s what the last flight was likeBoeing outsold Airbus last year for first time since 2018, deliveries rise to 600Perks for elitesThose with elite MileagePlus Premier status will get deeper discounts and better miles redemption. Elites with a card get at least 15% off mileage tickets. United said its a seat in a long-haul business class Polaris cabin that is going for 200,000 miles would be 170,000 miles if the cardmember has elite Premier status. United added the lowest priced \"Saver Award\" seats for Polaris would be accesible to MileagePlus members with a United card, seats that were previously just available to high-tier elites.Their earning rates also increase if they have both the credit card and status. MileagePlus 1K, the highest tier before Global Services, will get 17 miles for each dollar spent when they use their United Club credit card. What's happening to basic economy flyers?United Airlines travelers who don't have the credit card won't receive miles for basic economy tickets. American Airlines last year similarly said it would no longer allow travelers in that class to earn miles, following an earlier move by Delta Air Lines. There's an exemption, however, for holders of United's elite Premier status, who can still earn miles in basic economy.What about business travelers?Business travelers often have to book with company credit cards under corporate travel policies. But United said that individuals who personally hold a United credit or debit card will still get more miles than an employee who doesn't.",

    "body": "The International Energy Agency (IEA) 2026 Ministerial Meeting and Energy Innovation Forum in the OCDE in Paris, France, on February 18 and 19, 2026.Nurphoto | Nurphoto | Getty ImagesU.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright said on Thursday that the U.S. would \"pressure\" the International Energy Agency to move away from net zero — and quit from the global watchdog if it failed to do this.Wright was speaking on the last day of an IEA ministerial meeting in Paris and shortly after he said the agency would need to reform for the U.S. to remain a long-term member.\"There has been such a group mentality, 10 years invested in a destructive illusion of net zero by 2050, that the U.S. will use all the pressure we have to get the IEA to eventually, in the next year or so, move away from this agenda,\" Wright said, according to Reuters.The 2015 Paris Agreement committed nations to \"net zero\", the balancing of carbon emitted into the atmosphere and removed from it. The U.S., India and the European Union were among the polluters that ratified the accord.Wright added that it was not Washington's intention to leave the IEA, as there's \"always a risk\" China could gain dominance in the agency if it did. CNBC has reached out to the U.S. Department of Energy and the IEA for comment. A long-running war of wordsThe IEA, which was established in 1974 to ensure the security of oil supplies, faced criticism from the Trump administration last year when it projected that \"peak oil\", when global crude production will reach its highest point before entering an irreversible decline, will take place around 2030.OPEC, the influential group of oil-exporting countries, accused the energy agency of fearmongering and risking the destabilization of the global economy. Wright called the IEA's forecast \"nonsensical.\"The energy watchdog later watered down its forecast, signaling in a major tonal shift that oil demand could keep growing through to the middle of the century.

REUTERS/Elizabeth FrantzElizabeth Frantz | ReutersA version of this article first appeared in CNBC's Healthy Returns newsletter, which brings the latest health-care news straight to your inbox. Subscribe here to receive future editions.This week, I had a chance to sit down with Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Dr. Marty Makary during a trip to Washington, D.C. Our conversation came in the midst of a contentious stretch for the FDA, defined by a leadership transition, massive staff and budget cuts and sweeping changes to vaccine policy and the agency's drug approval approach. Most recently, its back-and-forth on Moderna's flu shot has fueled industry concern about regulatory consistency. Here's what Makary had to say on some of the topics top of mind for the pharmaceutical industry. Watch my interview with Makary here.Mass compounded GLP-1sMakary said the FDA is \"serious\" about cracking down on unlawful, mass compounding of GLP-1s. This comes on the heels of the FDA announcing plans to take action against telehealth company Hims & Hers, which has been mass marketing compounded versions of Novo Nordisk's Wegovy pill and injections.  The FDA said it plans to restrict GLP-1 ingredients used in non-approved compounded drugs, citing concerns over quality, safety and potential violations of federal law.Makary said branded drug manufacturers go through the FDA process \"properly\" by conducting clinical trials that demonstrate the benefit of a product. The agency also regulates the marketing claims for those drugs, such as requiring that ads reflect side effects. But Makary said, \"Sometimes, what we've seen are companies that are violating those regulations.\" The FDA is \"directly talking to these companies and saying, you have to play by the rules,\" he added. When asked if 2026 could be the end of illegal mass compounding of GLP-1s, Makary said, \"I hope so.\" The FDA is seeing more companies get their active pharmaceutical ingredients from Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly, \"and that system has a path of working.\" \"If [Novo and Lilly] are providing APIs and the compounding meets the regulation, then the more competition, the better,\" he said. Moderna's flu shot applicationNotably, my conversation with Makary came one day before the FDA agreed to review Moderna's experimental mRNA flu shot, reversing the agency's earlier decision to refuse to accept the application. The FDA is now slated to decide whether to approve the flu shot on Aug. 5. Makary did not indicate that the agency would change its decision. Instead, he said the FDA's guidance to Moderna on its jab \"was pretty clear.\"\"I think the FDA individual guidance process, when the companies meet with the FDA scientists, is pretty strong, and that guidance is pretty clear on how they want the trials designed,\" he said.The agency recommended that the group of participants ages 65 and up in the study who didn't take Moderna's shot receive the \"standard of care, not the substandard of care\" as a comparison product, Makary said. The FDA's previous feedback expressed a preference for Moderna to use a higher-dose vaccine for older adults as a comparator in the trial.Moderna has disputed that reasoning, noting that FDA rules and guidance does not actually require trials to use the most advanced or highest-dose vaccine as a comparator in clinical studies. The company has also said it is inconsistent with the FDA's prior written communication about the trial design, even before the study began, where the agency said using the standard flu shot would be \"acceptable.\"When asked about his stance on mRNA technology, Makary said he's \"hopeful and optimistic\" about the platform but would also \"like to see the data.\" Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and some of his supporters have criticized that technology as unsafe. \"We're not going to get ahead of the game,\" he said. \"We're going to basically say, we'd like to see the data, how far mRNA technology can be applied is a question where we'd love to see it applied, as far as it can be applied, but it's got to meet our scientific standards, so we'll see what it gets with cancer, with other infectious diseases. ...\"ChinaMakary also warned that the U.S. is falling behind China in early-stage drug development and called for reforms to streamline how new treatments enter clinical trials. China's biotech sector has expanded rapidly in recent years, fueled by heavy state investment, deep talent pools and faster regulatory timelines. U.S. policymakers have faced mounting pressure to boost domestic innovation rather than attempt to stymie it in China.  \"We walked into a mess,\" Makary said, referring to the gap between the U.S. and China in phase one trials conducted in 2024. Makary pointed to three key bottlenecks: hospital contracting, ethics reviews and approvals, and the process for submitting Investigational New Drug (IND) applications that allow companies to begin human testing. He described the first two as \"clunky processes that take too long and are leaving us non-competitive with the countries that are moving a lot faster.\" For the latter, he said the FDA has added too many questions to the application over the years. \"They've never removed questions,\" he said. \"If a question has had the same affirmative answer the last 10,000 out of 10,000 times, then why are we asking?\"He said the FDA is \"looking at everything,\" including potential partnerships with health systems and academic medical centers to speed up the pre-IND process.The Trump administration should \"partner with industry to help them deliver more cures and meaningful treatments for the American public,\" Markary said, calling the effort a \"bipartisan priority.\"Feel free to send any tips, suggestions, story ideas and data to Annika at a new email: annika.constantino@versantmedia.com.",

    "body": "India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi (L) takes a group photo with AI company leaders including OpenAI CEO Sam Altman (C) and Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei (R) at the AI Impact Summit in New Delhi on February 19, 2026.Ludovic Marin | Afp | Getty ImagesOpenAI's Sam Altman and Anthropic's Dario Amodei had an awkward moment on Thursday as they chose not to hold hands during a group photo of political and tech leaders. They were on stage at the India AI Impact Summit, alongside Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Google and Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai, among others. Both had been keynote speakers.Modi had lifted Altman and Pichai's hands before an applauding crowd, with others following suit. However, Altman and Amodei, who were next to each other, raised their fists instead of holding hands with one another. It comes as competition intensifies between ChatGPT maker OpenAI and Claude maker Anthropic, with both vying for their models to become the default choice for consumers globally. The companies have also recently traded shots over the potential use of adverts in AI models.The image of Altman and Amodei opting out of holding hands quickly made the rounds on social media.Siddharth Bhatia, cofounder of AI startup Puch AI, posted on X: \"When AGI? The day Dario and Sam hold hands.\"Justine Moore, an investing partner at Andreesen Horowitz, shared a picture with the words: \"When you're forced to do a group project with your opp.\"watch nowLast month, Anthropic released Super Bowl commercials that poked fun at OpenAI's plan to start testing ads for free users and ChatGPT Go subscribers in the U.S. Altman called the ads \"clearly dishonest,\" saying: \"I guess it's on brand for Anthropic doublespeak to use a deceptive ad to critique theoretical deceptive ads that aren't real, but a Super Bowl ad is not where I would expect it.\"Anthropic's chief customer officer, Paul Smith, later told CNBC that it was focused on growing its business rather than making \"flashy headlines,\" in a veiled swipe at OpenAI.Speaking at the summit after the photo, Altman told CNBC: \"We still have some work to do to figure out the exact ad format that's going to work best.\"Anthropic was founded in 2021 by a group of former OpenAI staff and researchers, including Amodei, who left the company after disagreements over its direction. The company has marketed itself as a \"safety-first\" alternative.OpenAI and Anthropic have since raised billions of dollars of capital as they've competed for users, enterprise customers and market share.During his speech at the summit on Thursday, Amodei discussed the \"serious risks\" associated with AI, including the autonomous behavior of AI systems, their potential misuse by individuals and governments, and the potential for economic displacement.During his speech, Altman argued that the industry's understanding of AI safety should include \"societal resilience,\" adding: \"We believe no AI lab can deliver a good future on their own.\"",

Tingshu Wang | ReutersThe U.S. deficit with its global trading partners nearly doubled in November as the shortfall with the European Union swelled and the impact of President Donald Trump's tariffs worked their way through the economy, the Census Bureau reported Thursday.Following a month where the trade deficit hit its lowest level since early 2009, it shot up to $56.8 billion, an increase of 94.6% from October. Of that gain, about one-third came with the European Union, where the goods deficit rose by $8.2 billion. The goods deficit with China decreased by about $1 billion to $13.9 billion.On a year-over-year basis, the deficit through November stood at $839.5 billion, or about 4% higher than the same period in 2024.The increase in the deficit counters Trump's efforts to use tariffs to reduce imbalances around the globe. When announcing so-called reciprocal tariffs in April 2025, the White House used the level of trade deficits with varying countries as a baseline for determining the duties.As the year went by, Trump softened his stance. A framework agreement between the U.S. and the EU in August put the tariff rate at 15% on most European goods and sought to stabilize relations between the two sides.Clarification: The headline on this story was updated to clarify that it was the trade deficit that soared 94% in November.",

Samuel Corum | Getty ImagesPresident Donald Trump said Thursday that he will be naming his pick Friday for the new Federal Reserve chair.Speaking at the premiere for \"Melania,\" the film about first lady Melania Trump, the president said the five-month odyssey of finding his pick to succeed current Chair Jerome Powell is about to end.\"I'll be announcing the Fed chair tomorrow morning,\" Trump said. Asked if he had actually settled on a choice, he replied, \"I do, I better, otherwise I have to go to work very quickly.\"The process for deciding on Powell's replacement began in September with an 11-candidate field that included past and current Fed officials, economists and Wall Street investment professionals. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent screened the qualifying candidates, whittling the list down to five and then four. The final four is believed to be former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh, National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett, current Fed Governor Christopher Waller and BlackRock chief investment officer for fixed income Rick Rieder.Prediction markets have been betting on who gets the job. Hassett had been the leader for some time, then Warsh and for the past several days Rieder. However, that flipped Thursday evening, with Kalshi now putting Warsh as a prohibitive 80% favorite.An administration source told CNBC that Warsh was at the White House on Thursday. However, a White House official dismissed speculation.\"President Trump will make an announcement about his pick for the Federal Reserve at the appropriate juncture. Any and all reporting on the Federal Reserve Chairman nominations process until then is a waste of everyone's time,\" said White House spokesman Kush Desai.For his part, Powell balked at questions over whether he will stay on after his term as chair expires in May. Powell has the option of serving out the remaining two years on his governor's term.",

    "body": "U.S. President Donald Trump speaks in the Oval Office at the White House on Jan. 29, 2026 in Washington, DC. Samuel Corum | Getty ImagesPresident Donald Trump on Thursday endorsed a Senate deal to fund the vast majority of the federal government through the remainder of the fiscal year.Trump's endorsement is likely to significantly ease the passage of a six-bill funding package the Senate is considering with just over a day until a partial government shutdown. Senators clinched a deal shortly before Trump's announcement, agreeing to strip funding for the Department of Homeland Security from the package and pass the other five bills, while DHS will be funded by a stopgap.\"Republicans and Democrats in Congress have come together to get the vast majority of the Government funded until September, while at the same time providing an extension to the Department of Homeland Security (including the very important Coast Guard, which we are expanding and rebuilding like never before),\" Trump said in a Truth Social post. \"Hopefully, both Republicans and Democrats will give a very much needed Bipartisan 'YES' Vote,\" he said. The Senate is expected to begin taking up the revised bill Thursday night, which would fund the Departments of Defense, Treasury, State, Health and Human Services, Labor, Housing and Urban Development, Transportation, and Education. Democrats demanded to strip the DHS portion of the bill after two U.S. citizens were shot and killed by federal immigration agents in Minnesota this month.

Schumer's office said the stopgap for DHS would provide funding for two weeks. The Senate's move to break off the DHS bill from the broader package assures that the House will need to reapprove the package. The House is out on recess with plans to return next week, meaning a government shutdown could still occur over the weekend. A government shutdown last year stretched for a record 43 days. House Speaker Mike Johnson told MS NOW earlier Thursday that he is \"trying to figure all that out\" and wants members to return to Washington \"as soon as possible.\" Johnson cautioned it could take up to 72 hours for all members to return to Washington. The Senate is now \"hotlining\" the proposal, a process to ensure it has unanimous support in the upper chamber. Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., will likely need unanimous support to speed passage of the bill with the shutdown deadline looming at 12:01 a.m. Saturday. Senate Republicans began to close in on the deal after a procedural vote on the full six-bill package failed earlier in the day. Seven Republicans joined all Democrats in opposing the measure, underscoring how badly Republicans would need Democrats to overcome the Senate's 60-vote filibuster.Republican senators earlier Thursday said Senate Democrats were negotiating with the White House directly on a deal.

    "body": "An apartment for rent sign hangs outside of an apartment building on Dec. 4, 2025 in San Francisco, California. Justin Sullivan | Getty ImagesApartment rents continued their slide into the new year, as fresh supply still makes its way through the market, and landlords strive to gain pricing power over a struggling consumer. The national median rent in January was $1,353, a drop of 1.4% compared with one year ago, according to Apartment List. This is now the fourth consecutive winter with a \"pronounced\" offseason dip, and is the largest annual drop since September 2023 and the lowest January rent since 2022. Rents are now 6.2% lower than their last peak in the summer of 2022. The national vacancy rate was 7.3% in January, a record high on Apartment List's index, which dates to 2017. Units are also taking an average of 41 days to get leased, four days more than in January 2025 and another high for the index. \"Early last year, it appeared that annual rent growth was on track to flip positive for the first time since mid-2023; however, that rebound stalled out and reversed course during a slow summer moving season that has now dragged into the winter,\" wrote Chris Salviati, chief economist at Apartment List.The record supply of new apartment units has peaked, but there is still a good amount coming through the pipeline. That is coming up against weaker demand because of a tighter job market and slower household formation.

Markets in the Northeast, Midwest and parts of the West Coast continue to see rising rents despite the general winter slowdown.Austin, Texas, wins the dubious distinction of the softest rental market in the nation, with the median rent there down 6.3% from the year before. It is followed by New Orleans; San Antonio; Tucson, Arizona; and Denver.Virginia Beach, Virginia, is seeing the fastest rent growth at 5%. It is followed by San Jose and San Francisco, California; Chicago; and Providence, Rhode Island.\"The wave of construction that has been driving these conditions is waning, but whether or not market conditions shift will now depend on rental demand, whose outlook has grown shakier due to weakness in the labor market and general economic uncertainty,\" Salviati wrote.

    "body": "A view of Oslo seen from the roof of the Oslo Opera House in Oslo, Norway, on Thursday, Oct. 21, 2021.Bloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesNorway's $2 trillion sovereign wealth fund made $247 billion in 2025, its management team said Thursday, thanks to rallying tech, financial and mining stocks.The fund posted annual profit of 2.36 trillion kronor, or $246.9 billion. By the end of last year, the fund's total value stood at 21.27 trillion Norwegian kroner Over the course of 2025, the fund returned 13.5 trillion kronor — its highest annual return since the fund's inception in the nineties.The overall return was 0.28 percentage points lower than the return on its benchmark index. Equities, which make up about 71% of the fund's investments, returned 19.3% last year. Norges Bank Investment Management (NBIM) manages the fund on behalf of the Norwegian population. Set up in the 1990s to invest excess revenues from Norway's oil and gas industry, the fund is currently an investor in more than 7,000 companies across 60 countries.Its most valuable investments include a 1.3% stake in Nvidia, a 1.2% stake in Apple and a 1.3% stake in Microsoft. \"Stocks in technology, financials and basic materials stood out, making a significant contribution to the overall return\", Nicolai Tangen, NBIM's CEO, said in a statement on Thursday.NBIM's holdings in the basic materials sector include mining giant Fresnillo — the best-performing stock on London's FTSE 100 last year, which surged 452.5% amid a silver boom and its acquisition of Probe Gold.In the financial sector, NBIM holds significant stakes in Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs. The fund also has various holdings in global lenders, including European banking giants Santander, UBS, HSBC and UniCredit. Europe's banking sector has been a source of major returns for investors in recent years.Outside equities, NBIM's fixed income investments returned 5.4% in 2025, while unlisted real estate returned 4.4%. Its renewable energy infrastructure holdings returned 18.1% last year. Read moreThe fund increased in value by 1.53 trillion kroner — around $159.9 billion — in 2025.White House clash While the fund's returns were positive in 2025, some of its decisions drew criticism — notably from the White House.In September, the U.S. State Department told CNBC it was \"very troubled\" by fund's decision to exit positions in American machinery manufacturer Caterpillar and five Israeli banks, citing \"unacceptable risk\" that the companies were contributing to rights violations in Palestinian territories.A spokesperson argued NBIM's Caterpillar exit \"appears to be based on illegitimate claims against Caterpillar and the Israeli government.\"Norway's finance minister, Jens Stoltenberg, later said the divestment was \"not a political decision.\"American equities account for 38.8% of all the fund's investments.Stoltenberg told Bloomberg last week that he saw no reason for the fund to exit the United States.\"Our presence in the United States reflects the size of the U.S. market. And I think that's the best way for a very long-term fund,\" he said at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.Correction: The headline and text of this article have been updated to correct a conversion error when reporting the fund's return in US dollars.",

    "body": "Luigi Mangione appears in Manhattan Supreme Court for a suppression of evidence hearing in the killing of United Healthcare CEO Brian Thompson, Dec. 2, 2025.Curtis Means | Via ReutersA Minnesota man was arrested after allegedly showing up Wednesday night at a New York federal jail claiming to be an FBI agent and saying he had a court order from a judge to release an inmate, according to a new criminal complaint Thursday. That inmate is Luigi Mangione, according to a person in law enforcement, who asked not to be named because they were not authorized to speak publicly on the matter.Mangione is accused of murdering UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson on a midtown Manhattan street in December 2024.The Minnesota man, 36-year-old Mark Anderson of Mankato, when asked by Bureau of Prisons personnel at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn for his credentials, produced a Minnesota driver's license, prosecutors said. Mangione is being held at that jail without bail.Anderson also allegedly said he had weapons in a bag he was carrying. Inside the bag was a barbecue fork and a circular steel blade that resembled a pizza cutter, according to the criminal complaint filed by the U.S. Attorney's Office in Brooklyn.\"Anderson also displayed and threw at the BOP officers numerous documents,\" an FBI agent who signed the complaint wrote. \"I have reviewed those papers and they appear to be related to filing of claims against the United States Department of Justice,\" the agent wrote.A barbecue fork, driver's license and circular steel blade allegedly found in the possession of Mark Anderson of Mankato, Minnesota, when he was detained after allegedly posing as an FBI agent at the Metropolitan Detention Center in New York on Jan. 28, 2026.U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New YorkAnderson is being charged with impersonating an FBI agent and is scheduled to appear Thursday afternoon in Brooklyn federal court, where he is charged in a complaint.The complaint does not identify by name the inmate that Anderson allegedly hoped to free. But the person in law enforcement confirmed that it was the 27-year-old Mangione.Anderson had traveled to New York City for a job opportunity that did not work out and had been working in a pizzeria, according to that person.Read more CNBC politics coverageMan poses as FBI agent to try to free Luigi Mangione from jail, source saysTrump backs Senate government funding deal that includes DHS extensionSenate Ag Committee advances Republican crypto billSenators closing in on funding federal government less than two days from shutdownWatch live: Trump holds Cabinet meeting at White HouseHoman: ICE and CBP crafting drawdown plan in Minnesota, says improvements neededDenmark lauds talks with U.S. over Greenland: 'Now we are back on track'Government shutdown: Republicans mull escape hatch as Congress careens toward deadline'ICE is not a law unto itself,' Minnesota judge says after immigrant releasedHis arrest came hours after state prosecutors in Manhattan Supreme Court urged a judge there to set Mangione's murder trial for July. That is two months before jury selection is set to begin in the Manhattan federal court case where Mangione is also charged with multiple crimes related to killing Thompson, a Minnesota resident whose company is the largest private health insurer in the United States.Prosecutors alleged that Mangione stalked and then fatally shot Thompson on the morning of Dec. 4, 2024, as the CEO was walking into a midtown Manhattan hotel for an investors' event held by UnitedHealth Group, the parent of UnitedHealthcare.Mangione was arrested at a McDonald's in Altoona, Pennsylvania, five days after the slaying.He has pleaded not guilty in both cases.Federal prosecutors are seeking to impose the death penalty on Mangione if he is convicted in their case. The judge in that case could rule this week on whether Mangione will face a possible death sentence.Correction: This story was updated to reflect that the new criminal complaint did not name the inmate Anderson allegedly attempted to free from the jail.",

    "body": "Comcast posted mixed results for its fourth quarter on Thursday, beating analyst expectations on earnings but slightly missing on revenue. Once again, Comcast's broadband business showed signs of significant competition facing cable companies. Comcast said it lost 181,000 domestic broadband customers during the period, although it said the losses were offset by an increase in international subscribers. The company's mobile offering remained a bright spot, notching 364,000 additions during the period and bringing its total to more than 9.3 million mobile customers for Comcast's newest business. Last year, Comcast said it was shifting its strategy to focus more on growing its mobile business after facing continued pressure in broadband, mainly due to competition from wireless providers like Verizon and T-Mobile. \"The competitive environment for broadband remains intense, similar to prior quarters, but we saw wireless competition step up towards the end of the fourth quarter,\" said Comcast CFO Jason Armstrong during Thursday's call with investors. \"Against that backdrop, we continue to advance our new go-to-market strategy we launched earlier this year.\" Here's how Comcast performed in the period ended Dec. 31 compared with average analyst estimates, according to LSEG: Earnings per share: 84 cents adjusted vs. 75 cents expectedRevenue: $32.31 billion vs. $32.35 billion expected Net income attributable to Comcast decreased 54.6% to $2.17 billion, or 60 cents per share, compared with $4.78 billion, or $1.24 per share a year earlier. Adjusting for certain one-time items — like the value of intangible assets, charges associated with investments and prior-year tax benefits that Comcast said made for an \"unfavorable comparison\" — the company reported adjusted net income of $3.06 billion, or 84 cents per share. Comcast's adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization were down 10% to $7.9 billion. The company's overall quarterly revenue was up more than 1% to $32.31 billion. Revenue for Comcast's connectivity and platforms unit – which includes its Xfinity-branded services across broadband, pay TV and mobile – was down 1% to $20.24 billion. In particular, revenue fell 1% for the domestic broadband unit to roughly $6.32 billion. While this reflected the decrease in broadband customers, it was partially offset by higher average rates, Comcast said. In addition to the broadband customer losses and mobile additions, Comcast lost 245,000 pay TV customers during the fourth quarter. The company now has 11.27 million total pay TV customers. Meanwhile, revenue for the company's media unit, which includes NBCUniversal, rose 5.5% to $7.62 billion. This marks the final quarter that NBCUniversal's earnings report includes its full portfolio of cable networks, as Comcast spun out most of its pay TV networks, including CNBC and MS Now, into the publicly traded entity Versant. Domestic advertising revenue for the media business was up 1.5% due to the addition of the NBA on NBC, which helped propel overall revenue.  NBC's streaming service, Peacock, added 3 million paid customers after three quarters of essentially no change. It ended the year with 44 million paid subscribers. The streaming service reported losses of $552 million for the fourth quarter, wider than the $372 million in losses it recorded in the prior year period.Those losses were due in part to the impact of the NBA rights deal which began during the quarter. Peacock saw $1.6 billion in revenue compared with $1.3 billion the year-ago quarter.Comcast's Universal film studio revenue was down 7.4% to $3.03 billion due to a drop in licensing and theatrical revenue when compared with the prior-year quarter. The releases of \"Wicked: For Good\" and \"Black Phone 2\" fell short of last year's \"Wicked\" and \"The Bad Robot.\"Universal theme parks revenue, however, was up 22% to roughly $2.9 billion, driven by last year's opening of Epic Universe.Disclosure: Versant Media is the parent company of CNBC. Comcast was the parent company of CNBC through the fourth quarter of 2025. ",

The iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF (IGV) dropped 5.4% for its biggest one-day decline since last April during the tariff-triggered downturn. The fund is now down about 22% from its recent high, pushing the software industry into bear-market territory and underscoring how quickly sentiment has turned against one of Wall Street's former favorite industries.Month to date, IGV is down more than 13%, on pace for its worst month since October 2008 when the fund fell 23%.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconThe iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF over one yearStock Chart IconStock chart iconServiceNow 5 days\"Good, but not good enough,\" Morgan Stanley analysts said in a note of ServiceNow's report. \"In an environment of heightened investor skepticism on incumbent application vendors, stable growth, in line with expectations, likely falls short of shifting the narrative.\"The pressure has deepened across the sector as investors question whether AI competitors and automation tools could erode demand for traditional software licenses and workflows. Valuations once justified by steady subscription growth are being recast as investors assess the possibility that AI could permanently shrink long-term revenue potential.Megacap Microsoft  added to the pressure, sliding 10% after reporting a slowdown in cloud growth for the fiscal second quarter, putting the stock on track for its steepest one-day drop since March 2020. The company also issued softer-than-expected guidance on operating margin for the fiscal third quarter.Investor unease has been amplified by the rapid pace of AI development itself. Anthropic released Claude Opus 4.5 late last year, its third major model launch in just two months. The company said the model excels at coding, operating computers and assisting with complex enterprise tasks, with ideal users including professional software developers and knowledge workers such as financial analysts, consultants and accountants.\"It is a little embarrassing that in 10 days, Anthropic was able to invent, co-work, put it out and everybody ... could look at it and go, 'Wow, why isn't Microsoft doing that? Why don't I know about that?' And that is a narrative they need to fix,\" Ben Reitzes, head of technology research at Melius Research, said on CNBC's \"Squawk on the Street.\" \"I think patience is going to run thin on the Street.\"Also on Thursday, SAP slid 15.2% after the German software giant reported weaker-than-expected growth in its cloud contract backlog for the fourth quarter. Current cloud backlog rose 16% to 21.1 billion euro (US$25.3 billion), falling short of expectations for about 26% growth, which UBS analysts called a \"disappointment.\"ServiceNow CEO Bill McDermott sought to counter investor fears on the company's earnings call Thursday, saying concerns that AI will displace software vendors are misplaced. \"The real payoff comes when trillions of tokens move beyond pilots to be embedded directly into the workflows where business decisions are made,\" McDermott said. \"ServiceNow is the gateway to this shift, serving as the semantic layer that makes AI ubiquitous in the enterprise.\"He added that because AI systems are probabilistic, companies still need workflow software to ensure consistent business outcomes.— With assistance from CNBC's Samantha Subin.",

The move trimmed the technology company's market cap by $357 billion, leaving it at $3.22 trillion by the end of Thursday trading.The iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector exchange-traded fund tumbled 5% on Thursday, while the technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite index finished the day down 0.7%. Not all of technology went down, though. Meta shares spiked 10% after impressing analysts with robust results and quarterly revenue guidance on Wednesday.Investors found a few imperfections in Microsoft's report. The all-important growth statistic for Azure and other cloud services came in at 39%, below StreetAccount's 39.4% consensus. The company called for about $12.6 billion in fiscal third-quarter revenue from the More Personal Computing segment that includes Windows, lower than StreetAccount's $13.7 billion consensus, and the implied operating margin for the new quarter also came up short.Microsoft's finance chief, Amy Hood, argued that the cloud result could have been higher if it had allocated more data center infrastructure to customers rather than prioritizing its in-house needs.\"If I had taken the GPUs that just came online in Q1 and Q2 in terms of GPUs and allocated them all to Azure, the KPI would have been over 40,\" she said.Read more CNBC tech newsA Waymo hit a child near an elementary school.

Analysts at UBS led by Karl Keirstead questioned Microsoft's choice to secure artificial intelligence computing capacity for products such as the Microsoft 365 Copilot productivity software add-on that has yet to succeed as much as OpenAI's ChatGPT.\"M365 revs growth is not accelerating due to Copilot, many checks on Copilot don't suggest a strong usage ramp (we plan to refresh our own checks in case we've missed a usage ramp) and the model market appears crowded and capital-intensive,\" the UBS analysts wrote. \"We think Microsoft needs to 'prove' that these are good investments.\"The negativity wasn't universal across Wall Street. Bernstein analysts led by Mark Moerdler, with the equivalent of a buy rating on Microsoft shares, applauded Microsoft's decision-making.\"Investors need, we believe, to understand that management made a cognizant decision to focus on what is best for the company long term rather than driving the stock up this quarter or even over last quarter and a few quarters to come (as capacity constraints likely abate),\" the analysts wrote in a Thursday note.Hood called for capital expenditures to decline slightly in the current quarter.WATCH: 'AI is eating software', says Melius' Ben Reitzeswatch now",

Fabrice Coffrini | Afp | Getty ImagesApple reported fiscal first-quarter earnings on Thursday that surpassed expectations, with revenue soaring 16% on an annual basis.  Shares of the company were up more than 1% in extended trading. Here are the results versus what Wall Street was expecting, according to LSEG consensus estimates for the quarter ending in December: EPS: $2.84 vs. $2.67 estimated Revenue: $143.76 billion vs. $138.48 billion estimated Here is how Apple performed versus LSEG consensus estimates:  iPhone revenue: $85.27 billion vs. $78.65 billion estimatedMac revenue: $8.39 billion vs. $8.95 billion estimated iPad revenue: $8.60 billion vs. $8.13 billion estimated Wearables, Home and Accessories revenue: $11.49 billion vs. $12.04 billion estimated Services revenue: $30.01 billion vs. $30.07 billion estimatedGross margin: 48.2% vs. 47.5% estimated Finance chief Kevan Parekh said that Apple expects revenue this quarter to rise between 13% and 16% on an annual basis, which would be equivalent to between $107.8 billion and $110.66 billion. Analysts polled by LSEG were expecting $104.84 billion. Apple said it expects constrained iPhone supply during the period. Apple also said it expects its Services unit to have a year-over-year growth rate similar to the 14% in the December quarter. The company reported $42.1 billion in net income, or $2.84 per share, versus $36.33 billion, or $2.40 per  share, in the year-ago period.  Overall iPhone revenue surged 23% on an annual basis to $85.27 billion, which the company attributed to strong sales of the iPhone 17 models released in September.  \"The demand for iPhone was just simply staggering,\" Apple CEO Tim Cook told CNBC's Steve Kovach. The strong growth is a reversal from the holiday quarter last year, when Apple reported iPhone sales that declined slightly. Cook said Apple now has an active base of 2.5 billion iPhones, Macs and other Apple devices, up from 2.35 billion announced in January last year. That number is closely watched because it points to the addressable market for Apple services, as well as for software on the company's platforms.  Apple saw particularly strong results in China, including Taiwan and Hong Kong. Sales in the region surged 38% during the quarter to $25.53 billion. Cook said that the performance in the region was driven by iPhone sales.  \"We set an all-time record for upgraders in mainland China, and we saw double-digit growth on switchers,\" Cook said. Upgraders refers to current iPhone users who bought newer models, and switchers means new customers who previously had phones from different brands.  In China, Apple \"saw a lift that, frankly, was much greater than we thought we would see,\" Cook said, adding that it was \"product-driven.\" Apple's sales of Mac laptops came up short of Wall Street expectations, and fell 7% on an annual basis. The company released an updated MacBook Pro laptop with a new M4 chip in November.The iPad business grew 6% in the quarter on an annual basis to $8.6 billion in revenue, beating expectations. Cook said that half of the people who bought an iPad during the quarter had not previously owned one.  The company reports AirPods, Apple Watch, Vision Pro and other accessories in a category called Wearables, Home and Accessories. Those sales fell 2% on an annual basis and missed Wall Street estimates.  Apple's services business includes subscriptions such as Apple TV and iCloud as well as advertising revenue from licensing agreements with Google, AppleCare warranties and other offerings. It grew 14% on an annual basis to $26.34 billion in sales. Cook said Apple TV's viewership rose 36% in December from a year ago.Earlier this month, the company announced it would partner with Google to use its Gemini AI model to power Apple Intelligence software. Apple has spent much less on artificial intelligence technology than its peers, such as Meta and Microsoft, which have committed to spending hundreds of billions on AI infrastructure.  \"We have absolutely the best platforms in the world for AI,\" Cook said.  Apple recorded $2.37 billion in capital expenditures for the quarter, down from $2.94 billion in the same period last year. But research and development expenses increased to $10.89 billion from $8.27 billion in the year-ago period.  \"AI is going to require incremental investment on top of our normal product road map investment,\" Parekh said. All of Apple's devices, including the iPhone, Mac and iPad, use a lot of storage and memory, raising questions about how the company plans to handle increased component costs as memory prices around the world are surging because of an AI-related shortage.  \"We're in a supply chain mode to meet the very high levels of customer demand we're currently constrained,\" Cook said. \"At this point, it's difficult to predict when supply and demand will balance.\"Cook added that one of the constraints was with the advanced chip manufacturing needed for Apple's processors. He also said that memory prices had a minimal impact during the quarter, but the company expects a bigger effect during the current period \"We do continue to see market pricing for memory increasing significantly,\" Cook said. Parekh said that Apple spent nearly $32 billion in the quarter on share repurchases and dividends. WATCH: Apple told us all about its new iPhone chips and on-device AI plans ",

    "body": "U.S. Senator John Boozman (R-AR) speaks on the day Brian Quintenz, U.S. President Donald Trump's nominee to lead the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) testifies before a Senate Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry Committee confirmation hearing on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C., U.S., June 10, 2025. Annabelle Gordon | ReutersThe U.S. Senate Agriculture Committee voted along party lines Thursday to advance its version of a cryptocurrency market structure bill to create CFTC regulatory authority over digital commodities, a major development for digital asset regulation.The Digital Commodity Intermediaries Act advanced on a party line-vote with 12 Republicans voting \"yes\" and 11 Democrats voting \"no.\" The vote is notable because it marks the first time a crypto market structure bill has advanced beyond a Senate committee. The Senate Banking Committee would also need to approve its version of a crypto market structure bill before the two measures could combine and advance to the full Senate.Senate Agriculture Committee Chairman John Boozman, R-Ark., proceeded with the bill after losing bipartisan support for an earlier version. Boozman had worked with Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., on a draft bill last year, but Booker walked away from the version the committee voted on Thursday. However, Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y., said in an interview with CNBC last week that she was \"very optimistic\" the Agriculture Committee would advance its measure.watch nowThe Senate Banking Committee's consideration of its version of the bill was postponed from Jan. 15 at the last minute after opposition from the crypto industry, including Coinbase. A new Banking date has not yet been set. Boozman said Thursday he looks forward to working with the Banking Committee on issues discussed in his committee. Those points include scams linked to crypto ATMs.  Boozman in a statement Thursday called the vote \"a critical step toward creating clear rules for digital asset markets.\" He said \"there's still more work ahead,\" adding that he is \"hopeful\" the development \"will build momentum in the Senate to advance this legislation.\" He said the measure would establish a clear legal definition of digital commodities and would create a spot market digital commodity intermediary regulatory regime with the CFTC. He said the bill also would create consumer protections, including conflict of interest safeguards and customer disclosure requirements.Boozman released the present version Jan. 21 to give the Commodity Futures Trading Commission new authority to regulate digital assets. The legislation builds on the bipartisan CLARITY Act, the crypto market structure bill the House of Representatives passed last summer, and incorporates provisions negotiated with Senate Democrats as well as input received during bipartisan meetings with stakeholders, according to Boozman.During Thursday's hearing, Booker noted that a bipartisan discussion draft was released in November and said that when he came back to Washington in January, he learned his \"Republican colleagues were walking away from the bipartisan process that produced the draft\" and were also \"walking away\" from a lot of the points \"that held our agreement together.\" Booker said \"the product put before us today is not the bipartisan draft that we have been working on.\" \"It was negotiated with two parties at the table, but it isn't in accord with the principles we laid out in November in a bipartisan way,\" he said. \"However, despite this, I still deeply believe in the work that we've done. We've come so long.\"Booker said Democratic concerns with the bill include the fact that President Donald Trump \"is grifting on crypto himself,\" which he called \"ridiculous.\"  He said \"the president of the United States and his family have made billions of dollars off of this industry and are still trying to create a framework here without the kind of ethics that would prevent this kind of gross corruption in our country that would undermine our nation's democracy.\"CNBC reached out to the White House for comment related to the concerns from Democrats tied to the president's crypto ventures, but did not immediately hear back. However, in past statements, a White House spokesperson told CNBC that \"there are no conflicts of interest.\" On Thursday, Democrats offered amendments that would have included banning public officials –including the president – from engaging in the crypto industry and addressing involvement in digital commodities from foreign adversaries. None were approved, with Boozman saying the issues are outside the Agriculture Committee's jurisdiction.watch now",

    "body": "Federal student loan borrowers who have defaulted on their loans could soon see their paychecks shrink as the Department of Education resumes garnishing wages over the unpaid debts.Around 1,000 defaulted borrowers were expected to receive notification of wage garnishments the week of Jan. 7, a department spokesperson told CNBC in December. The number of notified borrowers is expected to grow. Wage garnishments were initially paused in 2020 in response to the Covid-19 pandemic.The federal government has the authority to seize portions of borrowers' wages, federal tax refunds and Social Security retirement and disability benefits if they default on their loans, which occurs if they are at least 270 days late on a payment. The Department of Education first resumed the Treasury Offset program, which seizes defaulted borrowers' federal payments, on May 5, 2025.Borrowers will be notified 65 days prior to having their federal payments seized and 30 days prior to having their wages impacted, according to Federal Student Aid. The government can seize up to 15% of your disposable income, defined as your income after mandatory deductions like taxes, until you repay the loan in full or bring it out of default.Wage garnishment takes some of borrowers' money out of their control entirely, which can make a difficult situation worse if they are struggling with other commitments like rent or car payments, says Sophoan Prak, a financial advisor at Vanguard. More than 40% of borrowers report making tradeoffs between their loan payments and basic needs, a survey from The Institute for College Access and Success found in December. If you've been informed of upcoming wage garnishment, there are steps you can take to protect your paycheck, but you need to act quickly.\"Communication and early action are critical,\" Prak says. \"Wage garnishment doesn't have to derail your financial future if you take steps now to regain control.\"Here's what borrowers can do.Negotiate a repayment planIf your loans are in default and you have been notified of collection activity like wage garnishment, \"the first thing [you] should immediately do is try to get [your] loans out of default,\" Kyra Taylor, staff attorney at the National Consumer Law Center, says. One solution is to repay the defaulted student loan in full. If that's not possible, you may need to enter loan rehabilitation, in which borrowers negotiate a repayment plan with their servicer and must make nine consecutive, on-time monthly payments. Wages may still be garnished while you rehabilitate your loans, but it is legally required to stop after five monthly payments, says Bruce McClary, a senior vice president at the National Foundation for Credit Counseling. Garnishments or the seizure of federal payments do not count toward rehabilitation loan payments.You may be able to avoid wage garnishment by negotiating a payment plan with your loan servicer and making the first payment within 30 days of the wage garnishment notice, according to Federal Student Aid. Your payment could be as low as $5 a month on a negotiated plan, the agency says. You may only rehabilitate each loan once, however, so if you default again this will not be an option.How to object to wage garnishmentBorrowers facing wage garnishment can request a hearing if they object to it for one of the following reasons:The amount, enforceability or existence of your debt is in questionA 15% wage garnishment would produce an extreme financial hardshipYou've been employed for less than 12 months after having previously been involuntarily separated from employmentYou are eligible to have the loan discharged under statutory programs like Total Disability Discharge or Borrower Defense to Repayment — when you've been defrauded by your educational institutionYou must make a request for a hearing in writing, postmarked no more than 30 days after the notice of garnishment. You will need to provide documentation to support your objection and pay any legal expenses or travel fees associated with attending an in-person hearing. Hearings may be held in-person or over the phone, or may be decided based on the documentation you submit with your hearing request.\"It is very important that the borrower clearly explain their basis for an objection and provide evidence supporting their objection to the wage garnishment,\" Taylor says. \"A hearing officer — generally a Department of Education employee — will provide a written decision on the request for a hearing.\"A decision on your wage garnishment will typically be made within 60 days of your hearing request, Federal Student Aid says. As a result, you could see your wage garnishment paused for up to 12 months, reduced below 15% of your income or enforced at the full 15% allowed.Want to get ahead at work with AI?

    "body": "Pedestrians walk past a Saks Fifth Avenue store in Chicago, Dec. 30, 2025.Scott Olson | Getty ImagesBeleaguered retail chain Saks Global is struggling to line up as much as $1 billion in financing to keep its business afloat during a potential Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing, CNBC has learned. The luxury chain has been working to secure a \"debtor-in-possession\" loan, which would allow it to fund operations in the event of a potential bankruptcy filing, people familiar with the matter said. But investors have so far shown little interest in lending Saks the money because they're skeptical the company can successfully reorganize and pay them back, said the people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the discussions are private.While DIP lenders get repaid before other creditors during bankruptcy proceedings, they don't always recoup their full investment, and some investors are concerned that could happen if they finance Saks, the people said.The storied 159-year-old department store, which now owns Neiman Marcus and Bergdorf Goodman, is both a destination and a symbol for luxury fashion, known for offering top brands like Chanel and Dior alongside up and comers like Good American. Across the entire enterprise, Saks Global has more than 70 full-line luxury stores and about 100 off-price locations. Since Saks missed an interest payment to bondholders late last month, only a \"limited number\" of investors have shown interest in financing the DIP loan, while a number of others have declined to get involved, the people said. Saks declined to comment on investor interest in its fundraising efforts. A wide array of firms invest in companies that could be headed for bankruptcy, including top banks and private equity. However, the only firms likely to be interested in investing in Saks at this point are either liquidators that also have investment vehicles or alternative asset managers that have experience in distressed retail, one source said. Still, even some of those investors have declined to get involved with Saks' DIP loan, the people said. Liquidation is one of several potential outcomes Saks faces. However, if it can't line up a DIP loan, which would be used to pay for essential expenses like payroll, rent and inventory, that scenario would be more likely. The retailer is already struggling to pay those costs.Failure to line up financing would prevent Saks from filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, which would give the company a chance to reorganize and potentially find a buyer willing to take on its business as a going concern. It could then be faced with Chapter 7 bankruptcy, which is reserved for liquidation. That could mean the end for one of the most fabled department stores in history, whose flagship store on Fifth Avenue, considered by some to be its most valuable asset, has become a global destination. In the meantime, Saks has also been in talks with liquidators for a number of stores that are in the process of closing, but not yet the entire chain, the people said.Saks' troubles have been mounting since it acquired its longtime rival Neiman Marcus in a $2.7 billion deal in 2024, which was heavily financed with debt.The tie-up between the two rivals was expected to create a luxury retail powerhouse that could better streamline costs and negotiate with vendors.Instead, Saks has struggled to pay its vendors on time, leading to inventory gaps and declining sales. A slowdown in the overall luxury market, which has seen growth stagnate in recent years, has compounded the issues.",

    "body": "The U.S. government is considering investing in a company's critical minerals mining projects in Greenland, its CEO has told CNBC, ahead of high-stakes talks between Washington and Danish officials over the island's future.The projects are run by mining company Amaroq, which operates in South Greenland and is involved in extracting or exploring gold, copper, germanium and gallium, among other critical mineral deposits.Discussions with U.S. government bodies about the potential investment opportunities are ongoing and haven't been finalized, Amaroq CEO Eldur Ólafsson told CNBC in an interview.Deals could involve \"offtake agreements, infrastructure support and credit lines,\" Ólafsson added, though he declined to comment on what specific projects the U.S. government was interested in.When asked to comment, a U.S. State Department spokesperson, mentioning Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry, told CNBC: \"The United States is eager to build lasting commercial relationships that benefit Americans and the people of Greenland.\"President Trump reiterated the importance of Greenland to U.S. defense and underscored his commitment to the relationship by designating Governor Landry as Special Envoy to Greenland.\"CNBC approached the Export-Import Bank of the United States, or EXIM, for comment but had not received a response as this article went live.Ólafsson's comments come as U.S. President Donald Trump ramps up talk of acquiring Greenland, which he sees as integral to national security, following a dramatic military operation to seize Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro on Saturday.European nations have been scrambling to respond to escalating rhetoric about Greenland from the U.S., which has refused to rule out military action.U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio is to meet with officials from Denmark next week to discuss Greenland, a self-governing Danish territory.watch nowGreenland's critical mineralsThe White House sees Greenland's deposits as a potential way to break China's dominance in the critical minerals.Rare-earth companies with projects in the Arctic island surged earlier this week on U.S. comments about acquiring the territory.Trump has mainly emphasized national security when discussing Greenland in recent days, but former national security advisor Mike Waltz told Fox News in January 2025 that U.S. interest in the island was about \"critical minerals.\"Some experts have cautioned that extracting critical minerals from Greenland isn't economically viable due to the harsh conditions and lack of infrastructure, but Ólafsson told CNBC that it was realistic with proper planning and logistics.He compared the process to significant critical minerals mines in Russia and Alaska, which, he said, were built in similar conditions.He said that \"one of the biggest challenges in any mining project is usually some [transporting minerals] long distances on land,\" but added that many of Greenland's mineral deposits were near \"deep fjords,\" meaning they could be easier to ship. Climate change has transformed some parts of Greenland, with ice melting to reveal wetlands, areas of shrub and barren rock. This has made some of the island's strategic minerals more accessible for mining firms.",

    "body": "US President Donald Trump speaks during the House Republican Party (GOP) member retreat at the Kennedy Center in Washington, DC, on January 6, 2026. Mandel Ngan | Afp | Getty ImagesU.S. President Donald Trump said he has canceled a fresh military attack on Venezuela, saying the two countries \"are working well together,\" on rebuilding the nation's oil and gas infrastructure.Writing on Truth Social on Friday, Trump noted Venezuela's release of \"large numbers of political prisoners\" which he called \"a very important and smart gesture.\"\"Because of this cooperation, I have cancelled the previously expected second Wave of Attacks, which looks like it will not be needed, however, all ships will stay in place for safety and security purposes,\" Trump said.In a press conference on Jan. 3, Trump had suggested it was unlikely a second attack on Venezuela would be deemed necessary due to what he called the success of the first operation. \"We are ready to stage a second and much larger attack, if we need to do so,\" he told reporters at the time. \"So we were prepared to do a second wave if we needed to do so. We actually assumed that a second wave would be necessary. But now it's probably not — the first wave, if you'd like to call it, the first attack was so successful, we probably don't have to do a second but we're prepared to do a second wave, a much bigger wave.\"Washington launched a military operation in Venezuela over the weekend that led to the capture of the country's president, Nicolas Maduro, and his wife, Cilia Flores, both of whom were indicted on drug trafficking charges. The pair pleaded not guilty. Maduro claimed he'd been \"kidnapped\" and was a \"prisoner of war\" at a court appearance in New York this week. On Thursday, Jorge Rodríguez, head of Venezuela's National Assembly, announced that the government would release a significant number of foreign and Venezuelan prisoners. Spanish Foreign Minister José Manuel Albares later said five Spanish prisoners had been released and were on a flight back to their home country. Since Maduro's ousting, Trump has turned his attention to oil-rich Venezuela's energy resources, saying shortly after the operation took place that he had been in talks with oil giants about rebuilding the country's oil infrastructure. In his post on Friday, Trump said at least $100 billion will be invested in Venezuela by \"Big Oil,\" noting that he would meet with representatives for U.S. oil giants at the White House later on Friday. Chevron is currently the only oil major operating in Venezuela, and U.S. oil majors have so far been largely silent on Trump's push for their participation in rebuilding the country's energy systems. Venezuela, a founding member of the powerful OPEC energy alliance, sits on 303 billion barrels of crude oil, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. That represents around 17% of the world's oil reserves — but it's currently thought to produce less than 1% of global oil output, and exports only half of what it makes.On Tuesday, Trump said Venezuelan authorities would give the U.S. up to 50 million barrels of oil, which will be sold at market prices. \"That money will be controlled by me, as President of the United States of America, to ensure it is used to benefit the people of Venezuela and the United States!\" Trump said at the time. Sources close to the White House later told CNBC that Venezuela will ship sanctioned oil to the U.S. indefinitely. — CNBC's Sam Meredith contributed to this article. ",

    "body": "Iranians gather while blocking a street during a protest in Kermanshah, Iran on January 8, 2026. Kamran | Afp | Getty ImagesIran's supreme leader on Friday lashed out at anti-government protesters, saying they were \"vandals\" acting on behalf of U.S. President Donald Trump by destroying public properties.In a broadcast on national television, reported by Reuters, Ali Khamenei warned Tehran would not tolerate \"mercenaries for foreigners.\"\"The Islamic Republic came to power through the blood of hundreds of thousands of honourable people. It will not back down in the face of vandals,\" Khamenei said.  His comments came as the country of 92 million found itself largely cut off from the world on Friday, with authorities seeking to quell the sprawling protests by blacking out the internet.The demonstrations, which began in Tehran's bazaar on Dec. 28, have been fueled by growing frustrations over a long-running economic crisis, particularly the government's handling of a sharp fall in the nation's currency and soaring prices.The scale of the unrest makes it one of the widespread demonstrations in recent years, according to Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA), with dozens reported killed and nearly 2,300 arrested or detained. HRANA, a U.S.-registered non-profit, relies on an activist network inside Iran for its reporting. Iranian leader Ali Khamenei comments on the recent protests against economic conditions on Iranian State Television in the capital Tehran on January 9, 2026.Anadolu | Anadolu | Getty ImagesThe protests have also revived concerns about possible American intervention. Trump said last week that if Iran \"violently kills peaceful protesters,\" then the U.S. will \"come to their rescue.\"\"We are locked and loaded and ready to go,\" Trump wrote in a post on Truth Social on Jan 2.Iran's supreme leader adviser Ali Larijani reportedly responded at the time by saying that U.S. interference in Iran's protests was equivalent to chaos across the entire region.Iran, which is a member of OPEC, is a major player in the global oil market.Oil prices were last seen trading higher as energy market participants continued to monitor concerns over the disruption in Iran. International benchmark Brent crude futures with March expiry traded up 0.9% at $62.52 a barrel on Friday, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate futures with February expiry stood at $58.29, up 0.9% for the session.— CNBC's April Roach and Anniek Bao contributed to this report.",

    "body": "Federal agents clash with anti-I.C.E. protesters at the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement building on October 12, 2025 in Portland, Oregon. Mathieu Lewis-Rolland | Getty ImagesA U.S. Border Patrol agent shot and wounded a man and a woman in a vehicle on Thursday afternoon in  Portland, Oregon, after the driver allegedly tried to run over agents, a senior federal official said.The shooting occurred a day after a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent fatally shot Renee Nicole Good as she was driving toward him on a street in Minneapolis, Minnesota, after being ordered to exit her SUV by other ICE agents.McLaughlin and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem have accused Good, 37, of engaging in \"domestic terrorism,\" and claimed that she intentionally tried to run over ICE agents after blocking a residential street with her vehicle.Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and other Democratic officials have said those claims are false, pointing to videos of the shooting.The shooting in Portland occurred at 2:19 p.m. PT, as Border Patrol agents were \"conducting a targeted vehicle stop,\" Homeland Security Department Deputy Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a post on X.\"The passenger of the vehicle and target is a Venezuelan illegal alien affiliated with the transnational Tren de Aragua prostitution ring and involved in a recent shooting in Portland,\" McLaughlin said.\"The vehicle driver is believed to be a member of the vicious Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua,\" she said.\"When agents identified themselves to the vehicle occupants, the driver weaponized his vehicle and attempted to run over the law enforcement agents,\" McLaughlin said. \"Fearing for his life and safety, an agent fired defensive shots,\" she said. \"The driver drove off with the passenger, fleeing the scene.\"Portland Police said the unidentified man and the woman who were shot were taken to a hospital, and that their conditions were unknown. The FBI is leading the investigation of the shooting.Portland Mayor Keith Wilson, whose city has become a focus point for immigration enforcement actions by the Trump administration, in a statement, said, \"Just one day after the horrific violence in Minnesota at the hands of federal agents, our community here in Portland is now grappling with another deeply troubling incident.\"\"We cannot sit by while constitutional protections erode and bloodshed mounts,\" Wilson said.\"Portland is not a 'training ground' for militarized agents, and the 'full force' threatened by the administration has deadly consequences,\" he said. \"As Mayor, I call on ICE to end all operations in Portland until a full investigation can be completed.\"Portland Police Chief Bob Day, in a statement, said, \"We are still in the early stages of this incident.\"\"We understand the heightened emotion and tension many  are feeling in the wake of the shooting in Minneapolis, but I am asking  the community to remain calm as we work to learn more,\" Day said.Portland Police, in a statement, said they responded to a report of a shooting on Southeast Main Street, in the city's Hazelwood neighborhood.\"Officers confirmed that federal agents had been involved in a shooting,\" the statement said. \"Portland Police were not involved in the incident.\"\"At  2:24 p.m., officers received information that a man who had been shot was calling and requesting help in the area of Northeast 146th Avenue and East Burnside,\" police said. \"Officers responded and found a male and female with apparent gunshot wounds,\" the statement said.\"Officers applied a tourniquet and  summoned emergency medical personnel. The patients were transported to the hospital. Their conditions are unknown.\"\"Officers have determined the two people were injured in the shooting involving federal agents,\" police said.The FBI's Portland office, in an emailed statement to CNBC, said it was \"investigating an assault on a federal officers that happened at approximately 2:15pm near the 10000 block of Main St. in Portland involving two Customs and Border Patrol agents.\"\"The two assailants fled the scene immediately following the shooting and are currently being treated for their injuries,\" the office said. \"This remains an active and ongoing investigation led by the FBI.\"",

    "body": "General atmosphere during an IMAX private screening for the movie \"First Man\" at an AMC theater in New York City on Oct. 10, 2018.Lars Niki | Getty Images Entertainment | Getty ImagesThe theatrical industry is in flux — and one stock is rising above the rest.IMAX saw its shares jump more than 44% in 2025, even before the company announced that it had generated a record $1.28 billion at the global box office for the year. Those ticket sales marked a more than 40% increase over 2024 and were 13% higher than its previous record set in 2019.Meanwhile, shares of fellow theatrical stocks AMC, Cinemark and Marcus Theatres cratered in 2025. AMC was down more than 60%, Marcus Corporation, which operates theaters and hotel chains, slumped around 28% and Cinemark's stock fell 25%.The sharp declines on Wall Street come as theater operators struggle to grapple with massive changes in the industry.Domestic ticket sales have rebounded from the record lows posted during the Covid pandemic, but remain about 25% below the the record-breaking $11.8 billion collected in 2018. The 2025 box office fell short of the $9 billion analysts had projected heading into the year, signaling to industry watchdogs that post-pandemic hurdles could be more permanent than anticipated.\"In an environment where consumer spending headwinds and economic concerns forced consumers to be choiceful with their entertainment spending, streaming services continue to represent an attractive option,\" Eric Wold, executive director of equity research at Texas Capital Securities, told CNBC.At the same time that consumer habits have shifted toward the home entertainment market, Hollywood is producing fewer films. A combination of Wall Street penny-pinching, studio mergers and lingering production shutdowns from the pandemic and dual labor strikes has led to a significant drop-off in the number of movies hitting theaters. \"I think investors are still struggling with, and frankly, what everyone within the industry is still trying to figure out is, what is the real new normal for box office?\" said Robert Fishman, senior research analyst at MoffettNathanson.The winnowing of theatrical has left IMAX ahead of the pack. Move toward premiumWhen the theatrical slate is thin, IMAX benefits, because when moviegoers do decide to leave their couches they are opting more and more for premium large format experiences.In 2025, more than 16% of tickets sold for domestic showtimes were for these types of theaters, according to data from EntTelligence. That's up from 15% in 2024 and 13.8% in 2023. Often called PLFs, premium large format auditoriums are considered an elevated viewing experience, with bigger screens and higher-quality sound systems and seating options — and they come with higher ticket prices. In 2025, general movie tickets averaged $13.29 apiece, while PLF tickets went for around $17.65 each, EntTelligence data showed. For comparison, premium tickets in 2024 averaged around $16.88 apiece. As Hollywood shifts toward producing more big-budget blockbuster features — while medium-to-low budget films are more often sent to streaming — PLF screens will become increasingly important.After all, the films that benefit the most from PLF ticket sales have been Hollywood's biggest releases, as audiences want to see explosive action movies and dazzling spectacles in the most state-of-the-art locations. ScreenX is the world's first multi-projection cinema with an immersive 270 degree field of view.CJ 4DPLEXOn the docket for 2026 is Disney's \"Star Wars: The Mandalorian and Grogu,\" Universal and Christopher Nolan's \"The Odyssey,\" Netflix and Greta Gerwig's \"Narnia\" and Warner Bros. and Denis Villeneuve's \"Dune: Part Three.\" All of these films were shot with IMAX film cameras and will have theatrical releases on IMAX screens. The company has forecast its 2026 global box office haul at a new record of $1.4 billion. \"We see no signs of slowing down given a very promising slate ahead and the consistency of our market share gains, as filmmakers, studios, and audiences worldwide continue to gravitate toward the IMAX experience,\" said Rich Gelfond, CEO of IMAX, in a statement Wednesday.As of the end of September, IMAX had more than 1,700 locations and a backlog of 478 contracts to build IMAX screens. Notably, IMAX screens represent less than 1% of the total movie screens worldwide.Putting up profitsAMC, Cinemark and Marcus all have premium large format movie screens as part of their suite of theaters as well and have invested in creating more of these spaces in their cinemas. But the chains are playing a game of catchup. AMC, in addition to its existing partnership with IMAX, has plans to add more Dolby Cinema theaters to its U.S.-based locations as well as Screen X and 4DX auditoriums globally. Cinemark, too, made investments in the last year to add more Screen X theaters to its portfolio.Of course, these upgrades can be expensive. In the case of AMC, previous renovations prior to the pandemic saddled the company with billions in debt, which was exacerbated during Covid-related shutdowns. The company is still dealing with this debt load.Working in IMAX's favor is the fact that the company is notably asset-light, meaning it has minimized its ownership of physical assets like buildings by leveraging its technology and partnering with other companies. Instead of costly real estate leases, IMAX makes deals with cinema chains to install its equipment into their auditoriums and then takes a share of the box office receipts for films screened in those theaters.AMC, Cinemark, Marcus and other theater operators, on the other hand, have the financial burden of rent and utility payments, which are only partially offset by ticket sales that they split with studios. Concessions — popcorn, soda and specialty food — have become the means for these businesses to drum up enough funds to cover expenses.But, if the production slate isn't strong and cinemas don't have enough content to draw in moviegoers, then profitability is at risk. In the first quarter of 2025, all three cinema stocks posted net losses. Marcus and Cinemark rebounded to profitability in the second and third quarter, as the calendar of films improved, while AMC posted two more periods in the red.IMAX, on the other hand, was profitable in all three quarters. Through the first nine months of 2025, IMAX reported net income of $43 million, up 67% from the same period in 2024. The theater stocks will all report fourth-quarter results in the coming weeks as earnings reports roll out. ",

    "body": "A cargo ship sits in New York Harbor on Nov. 19, 2025 in New York City. Spencer Plat | Getty ImagesThe Supreme Court did not rule Friday on the legality of broad tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump, leaving markets still awaiting a decision poised to have far-reaching impacts on trade policy and the U.S. fiscal situation.There had been speculation that the tariff ruling would be issued on Friday, but the Supreme Court released just one opinion for the day, and it was unrelated to tariffs.It is unclear when the tariff ruling will be released.When it does come, the decision will address two issues: whether the administration can use provisions under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to levy the tariffs, and if it isn't proper, if the U.S. will have to reimburse those importers who already have paid the duties.However, the final decision could also fall somewhere in between.The court has the option to grant limited powers under the IEEPA and require only limited repayment, along with multiple other options for how it handles a touchy matter that is being closely watched on Wall Street.Moreover, even should the White House lose the case, it has other tools in its chest to implement tariffs that don't require the emergency powers cited under the act.Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent himself said Thursday he expects a \"mishmash\" ruling.\"What is not in doubt is our ability to continue collecting tariffs at roughly the same level, in terms of overall revenues,\" Bessent said during an appearance in Minneapolis. \"What is in doubt, and it's a real shame for the American people, was the president loses flexibility to use tariffs both for national security, for negotiating leverage.\"Trump used the IEEPA in part as an emergency measure to stop the inflow of fentanyl to the U.S. The impact of losingLosing the tariffs would have multiple ramifications, said Jose Torres, senior economist at Interactive Brokers.\"If the court blocks the tariffs, the administration is going to find workarounds,\" Torres said. \"President Trump is very ambitious in getting this agenda through despite potential controversies that could surround such a decision.\"\"Blocking tariffs would be bad for onshoring ambitions. It would be bad for fiscal conditions, rates would go higher,\" he added. \"But it would be good for corporate earnings. Input prices would be lower and trade would be smoother.\"Administration officials have cited a number of options to offset the court's decision should it not go their way. Prediction markets site Kalshi is pointing to just a 28% probability that the court will rule in favor of the tariffs as implemented. Torres said his firm's clients have a similar expectation. Bessent has said that the administration has at least three other options through the 1962 Trade Act that will keep most of the tariffs in place. However, he also has worried that reimbursements could place a strain on the administration and its effort to drive down the fiscal deficit. Tariffs brought in some $195 billion in fiscal 2025 and another $62 billion in 2026, according to Treasury data.Ultimately, Morgan Stanley analysts \"see significant room for nuance\" in the Supreme Court decision. The court \"has wide latitude when it comes to issuing decisions, a range of outcomes is possible, like the Court narrowing the scope of existing tariffs but not mandating their full removal or limiting the future application of tariffs,\" Morgan Stanley analysts Ariana Salvatore and Bradley Tian said in a note.\"We do think there's scope for the administration to take a lighter-touch approach to the overall tariff regime given a recent political focus on affordability,\" they added.The tariff impact thus far has defied analyst projections: There's been a limited impact on inflation, while the trade deficit has plunged, countering expectations in some quarters that the tariffs could make the U.S. a pariah on the global trading stage. The trade imbalance for October hit its lowest level since the end of the financial crisis in 2009, at a time when imports had declined sharply due to the massive recession the crisis generated.",

Andrew Caballero-Reynolds, Yuri Cortez | Afp | Getty ImagesPresident Donald Trump suggested in a new interview that the U.S. military could launch land strikes on drug cartels in Mexico.\"We've knocked out 97% of the drugs coming in by water. And we are going to start now hitting land, with regard to the cartels,\" Trump told Fox News host Sean Hannity in an interview aired on Thursday night.\"The cartels are running Mexico, it's very sad to watch and see what's happened to that country,\" Trump said.The White House did not respond to a request for comment from CNBC on the president's remarks. Trump's suggestion comes less than a week after U.S. forces struck Venezuela and captured its authoritarian leader, Nicolas Maduro, and his wife, Celia Flores. The Venezuelan government has said more than 100 people were killed in the military operation, which came after a months-long pressure campaign against Maduro.The Trump administration has carried out 35 known strikes on alleged drug boats in the Caribbean, killing 115 individuals, according to The New York Times.Trump previously has floated the idea of executing attacks on Mexico.\"Would I launch strikes in Mexico to stop drugs? OK with me, whatever we have to do to stop drugs,\" Trump told reporters in the Oval Office in November when asked if he would consider military action across the Southern border.Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum pushed back on Trump at that time, saying there would be no U.S. military action in Mexico without her permission. This week, Sheinbaum condemned the U.S. capture of Maduro and reaffirmed her country's sovereignty.\"It is necessary to reaffirm that in Mexico the people rule, and that we are a free and sovereign country—cooperation, yes; subordination and intervention, no,\" Sheinbaum said, according to Reuters.Read more CNBC politics coverageTrump suggests U.S. military will hit cartels on 'land' in MexicoTrump says he's canceled second wave of attacks on VenezuelaPortland: Border Patrol agent shoots 2 after ICE killing in MinneapolisTrump 'instructing' his 'Representatives' to buy $200B in mortgage bondsEpstein files: Reps ask judge to appoint special master for document releaseThe Trump administration has also threatened military action in Cuba, Colombia, and Greenland over the last week, prompting some backlash even from within the ranks of the congressional GOP.The Senate on Thursday took an initial vote to block Trump from further military action in Venezuela.Five Senate Republicans voted in favor of the measure, known as a War Powers Resolution, indicating it has enough bipartisan support to clear a final vote.Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, one of the GOP members to vote in favor of the preliminary measure, said she supported Trump's removal of Maduro, but also said that further action would require congressional approval.\"I distinguish that from what happens next,\" Collins said. \"And when the president raises the issue, as he has with not only Venezuela, but Greenland,  of military force being used, then it does implicate the War Powers Act and Congress's constitutional role.\"",

    "body": "GM Hummer EV production in Detroit.Photo by Jeffrey Sauger for General MotorsDETROIT – General Motors said Thursday it will record $7.1 billion in special charges for the fourth quarter of last year related to its pullback in electric vehicles and restructuring efforts in China.The Detroit automaker said in a public filing that the charges include roughly $6 billion related to changes to its EV plans amid weakening demand and $1.1 billion, including $500 million in cash, largely related to its previously announced overhaul of a Chinese joint venture.The charges will impact GM's net income but not adjusted results. The announcement was broadly anticipated after the Detroit automaker in October said it was reevaluating its EV plans and would initially take a $1.6 billion charge during the third quarter as a result. GM's new writedowns come after crosstown rival Ford Motor said in December it expected to record about $19.5 billion in special charges related to a restructuring of its business priorities and a pullback in all-electric vehicle investments.\"We continue to believe that there is a strong future for electric vehicles, and we've got a great portfolio to be competitive, but we do have some structural changes that we need to do to make sure that we lower the cost of producing those vehicles,\" GM CFO Paul Jacobson told CNBC in October.watch nowAutomakers commonly exclude \"special items\" or one-time charges from their adjusted financial results to provide investors with a clearer picture of their core, ongoing business operations.GM said the fourth-quarter EV impairments include non-cash charges of approximately $1.8 billion. The remaining $4.2 billion is related to supplier commercial settlements, contract cancellation fees and other charges, which will have a cash impact when paid.Additional EV charges are expected to hit this year but at a lower amount than 2025's impairments, GM said in the filing Thursday: \"We expect to recognize additional material cash and non-cash charges in 2026 related to continued commercial negotiations with our supply base, which we believe will be significantly less than the EV-related charges incurred in 2025.\"The automaker also said it may incur additional charges related to its emissions credits due to proposed regulatory changes to the greenhouse gas emission standards by the Trump administration.GM was among the first automakers to invest billions of dollars in an EV market that ultimately didn't materialize. At one point, the company was planning to invest $30 billion in EVs, including dozens of new models and capacity for battery production.The U.S. EV segment overall has experienced a sales slump after the Trump administration in September put an early end to a $7,500 federal tax credit previously available for EV buyers.Shares of GM closed Thursday at $85.13, up almost 4% on the day. The stock had a banner year in 2025, gaining more than 50% to lead all major publicly traded automakers.GM is set to report its fourth-quarter results on Jan. 27.",

    "body": "President Donald Trump speaks during a bill signing ceremony in the Oval Office of the White House, in Washington, Dec. 12, 2025.Francis Chung | Politico | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesPresident Donald Trump on Thursday said he is \"instructing my Representatives\" to buy $200 billion in mortgage bonds, claiming that doing so will drive rates and monthly payments down.Trump, in a Truth Social post, said he was issuing that directive because Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the two government-sponsored mortgage-issuing entities, are flush with cash.It was unclear who Trump is referring to as his representatives. The White House and the Federal Housing Finance Agency, which oversees Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, did not immediately respond to CNBC's requests for clarity.watch nowFHFA Director Bill Pulte posted on X later Thursday, \"We are on it. Thanks to President Trump, Fannie and Freddie will be executing.\" Hours before Trump's post, Pulte said in a CNBC interview that he expects Trump will make a decision in the next month or two on a possible initial public offering of Fannie and Freddie.Trump claimed that his latest directive would help restore \"affordability,\" a word that has become key to Democrats' political messaging as they accuse the Republican president of failing to address high prices.Trump heaped criticism on the administration of his predecessor, Joe Biden, claiming that Biden had \"ignored the Housing Market\" amid a slew of other policy failures.\"Everything was broken, but I, as President of the United States, have already fixed it!\" Trump declared. \"Now, I am giving special attention to the Housing Market.\"\"Because I chose not to sell Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in my First Term, a truly great decision, and against the advice of the 'experts,' it is now worth many times that amount — AN ABSOLUTE FORTUNE — and has $200 BILLION DOLLARS IN CASH,\" he wrote.\"Because of this, I am instructing my Representatives to BUY $200 BILLION DOLLARS IN MORTGAGE BONDS.\"It was not clear from Trump's post whether it would be Fannie and Freddie, the Treasury Department or another entity doing the buying.The Federal Reserve in the past has purchased mortgage bonds in an effort to lower rates, as part of the monetary policy known as \"quantitative easing.\" But the executive branch cannot order the independent central bank to initiate those transactions.The Treasury has purchased mortgage bonds in the past during times of extreme turmoil, such as the housing crisis of 2008 and 2009.It was also not clear whether this buying would have any impact on mortgage rates. The Fed's quantitative easing typically involves buying multiple types of securities, with larger amounts done in Treasuries in order to lower long-term Treasury rates.Mortgage rates typically follow the lead of long-term Treasury rates, rather than mortgage bond yields.The 10-year Treasury yield ticked slightly lower after hours amid Trump's comments.",

    "body": "President Donald Trump will meet Friday afternoon with more than a dozen oil companies at the White House to discuss plans for investment in Venezuela, less than a week after the U.S. ousted President Nicolas Maduro.The CEOs of Exxon, ConocoPhillips, Shell and a representative from Chevron will attend, sources told CNBC's Brian Sullivan. Representatives from Halliburton, Valero and Marathon will also be there.Secertary of State Marco Rubio, Energy Secretary Chris  Wright, and Interior Secretary Doug Burgum are attending as well.The White House called the 2 p.m. ET meeting, an industry source told CNBC. It was not scheduled at the request of the oil companies, the source said.Trump said in the immediate aftermath of Maduro's overthrow that U.S. oil companies will invest billions of dollars to rebuild Venezuela's energy sector. But the industry has been mostly silent as the security situation and stability of the government in Caracas remains murky. Venezuela has the largest proven crude oil reserves in the world at 303 billion barrels or about 17% of the global total, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. But its oil sector is in dire disrepair. Production has declined from a peak of about 3.5 million barrels per day(bpd)  in the 1990s to only around 800,000 bpd today, according to data from energy consulting firm Kpler. It will cost tens of billions of dollars to return Venezuelan production to its historic levels, Energy Secretary Wright said at a Goldman Sachs' conference in Miami Wednesday. Rystad Energy estimates it will cost more than $180 billion through 2040 for Venezuelan production to reach 3 million bpd. Working with ChevronThe Trump administration has provided few details on how it will encourage oil companies to make large investments in a country with history of nationalizing industry assets. Chevron is the only U.S. oil company currently operating in Venezuela through a joint venture with state oil company Petróleos de Venezuela (PDVSA). Wright told CNBC Wednesday that the U.S. is working closely with Chevron.\"Chevron is on the ground so we're getting daily updates,\" Wright told CNBC. \"They're actually working [under] this regime. So with them, how can we provide incremental tweaks or changes to allow their model to grow even more,\" the energy secretary said.  Venezuelan production could grow by several hundred thousand barrels per day in the short- to medium term with small capital deployments, Wright said. Exxon, Conoco doubtsBut Exxon and Conoco will need reassurances to return to Venezuela, Wright said. The companies exited the country after former President Hugo Chavez seized their assets in 2007. They have billions of dollars in outstanding claims against the government they won in arbitration cases.Wright said the debts Venezuela owes Exxon and Conoco need to be repaid at some point but are not an immediate priority for the Trump administration. The White House is focused on stabilizing Venezuela's economy through oil sales, the energy secretary said. \"We're trying to engineer a transition of Venezuela to a place that Americans want to do business in, want to invest new capital in, want to grow new partnerships with,\"  Wright said.But it is unclear whether the White House can convince companies like Exxon and Conoco to return to Venezuela without a dramatic change in government in Caracas.\"The big oil companies who move slowly, who have corporate boards, are not interested,\" Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Thursday at the Economic Club of Minnesota. \"I can tell you that the independent oil companies and individuals, wildcatters – our phones are ringing off the hook,\" Bessent said. \"They want to get to Venezuela yesterday.\" Leveraging oil salesThe U.S. has taken control of Venezuela's oil exports to pressure the government in Caracas, Wright said. Venezuela will ship tens of millions of barrels to the U.S., which the Trump administration will then sell, holding the proceeds in U.S.-controlled accounts, the energy secretary said. \"We need to have that leverage and that control of those oil sales to drive the changes that simply must happen in Venezuela,\" Wright said. The energy secretary said the U.S. is not stealing Venezuela's oil. The proceeds from the sales will be used to benefit the nation of 30 million, he said. Trump said Wednesday that the revenue from the oil will be used to purchase U.S.-made products.\"I have just been informed that Venezuela is going to be purchasing ONLY American Made Products, with the money they receive from our new Oil Deal,\" the president wrote on social media Wednesday. Purchases will include agricultural products, medicine, medical devices and equipment to modernize Venezuela's energy sector.\"In other words, Venezuela is committing to doing business with the United States of America as their principal partner,\" Trump said.

    "body": "A Rolls-Royce aircraft engine on view during the Hannover Messe industrial trade fair on March 31, 2025.Ronny Hartmann | Afp | Getty ImagesRolls-Royce shares have hit fresh record highs every single trading day so far this year, as the aerospace and defense firm reaps benefits from multiple directions – from its exposure to defense, to its thriving power systems business and a wider FTSE 100 rally.The broad theme for the company has lately been one around defense, and that has swept up the stock, leading to a nearly 1,200% gain over the past five years. Shares rose as much as 1.2% in early trading, building on a 10% rise in 2026, however it is still trailing other European defense stocks such as Rheinmetall, Leonardo, Saab and BAE Systems as geopolitical tensions stir markets.Early 2026 saw the U.S. conducting a large-scale attack on Venezuela, capturing its leader Nicolas Maduro, as well as subsequent talk about President Donald Trump wanting to take control over Greenland, followed by big moves in defense stocks. But Rolls-Royce isn't simply a defense company. Its defense business only accounts for about 25% of underlying revenue, and barely grew year-on-year in its last reported half-year results. Stock Chart IconStock chart iconRolls-Royce stock continued it's multi-year rally in 2026.\"Interestingly, in the short term, where we see the impact of [defense] growth show up is not in our defense business, it's actually in our power systems business, which has a governmental cycle, and we've got a leading position in land and naval defense there, and they tend to work in shorter cycles,\" CFO Helen McCabe told CNBC's \"Squawk Box Europe\" in July.Its power systems segment, which manufactures engines for ships and submarines, also houses its data centers business, which McCabe said had \"huge potential,\" with order intake increasing by 85% year-on-year.watch nowRolls-Royce's largest business by revenue, the civil aerospace unit which makes jet engines for commercial aircraft like Boeing and Airbus, is a long-term turnaround story, said UBS analyst Ian Douglas-Pennant on Friday, as he hiked his price target on the stock to 1,625p from 1,350p.The price target increase was due to upgraded expectations for growth in power generation sales 2028 to 26% from 20% for 2024-2028, Douglas-Pennant said, citing accretive data center sales. With the upgraded sales outlook, profitability (earnings before interest and taxes, or EBIT) in the power business could increase by as much as 60% by 2028, he added.Rolls-Royce has an emerging business of energy generation and in June received government backing to build the U.K.'s first small modular nuclear reactor.One potential concern for investors is that with the spike in share price, the stock's price-to-earnings ratio for the coming 12 months has reached over 36, according to LSEG, a valuation higher than most of its peers.Investors are now looking ahead to full-year results slated for Feb. 26, and will closely monitor news on its upcoming share buyback program, announced in December.— CNBC's Sam Meredith contributed to this report",

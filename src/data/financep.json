    "body": "A guest poses for a photograph during the Jellycat Road Trip to Joy at Nordstrom Michigan Avenue in Chicago, Illinois.Jeff Schear / Stringer/ Getty ImagesChristmas is just around the corner and if you're a stuck on what to gift your Gen Z family members, a cuddly plush toy might be the answer this year.  2025 has proved that toys are not just for kids, as more young adults show off extensive collections of plushies. Experts say it signals a longing for community and a return to childhood. The popularity has been driven by a manic craze for Labubu dolls — collectible toys produced by Chinese toy company Pop Mart — as well as for soft toys, also known as \"Jellies,\" designed by British brand Jellycat. Brightly coloured stuffed animals and wide-eyed dolls can be seen lined up on walls or falling out of overstuffed shelves, in videos posted by Gen Z on TikTok.The platform — which has become a barometer for Gen Z trends — is currently home to millions of videos showing young adults obsessed with plushies. Videos range from building a \"Labubu wall,\" to hacks on finding authentic Labubus, or a five-rack shelf dedicated to displaying Jellies.\"It's the biggest year we've ever seen of adults buying toys,\" Melissa Symonds, U.K. toys director at global consumer insights firm Circana, told CNBC Make It in an interview.\"Adults of all ages do buy into toys, but it's primarily the younger, the Gen Z people, that are really driving this strong growth that we've had in the last few years,\" Symonds said. Labubu dolls are on display at a Pop Mart store in Shanghai, China.Vcg | Visual China Group | Getty ImagesIn fact, a recent Circana report found that 43% of U.K. adults bought a toy for themselves or another adult this year, and that rises to 76% for Gen Z shoppers between the ages of 18 to 34-years-old.Across toy genres, plushies are the fourth most popular category for adults, with games and puzzles ranking top, following by building sets like LEGO, and action figures coming in at third place, according to data from Circanca shared with CNBC.It's a similar story across the pond, with sales of licenced toys increasing by 18% for U.S. adults over the age of 18 in the first half of the year, per Circana. \"There's almost this irony that when you're a kid, you can't wait to grow up, but then when  you're an adult, you realize that being a kid was the best time of your life.\"Melissa Symonds Executive director of toys at CircanaSymonds explained that businesses are tapping into what's called the \"joy economy\" in which consumers seek out comfort and nostalgia in products and experiences, especially when faced with economic or political pressures. \"The economy, the wars, everything is really depressing and serious, whereas toys just bring a little bit of joy back into life,\" Symonds said.  Pop Mart and Jellycat have benefitted from that trend. Pop Mart posted a near 400% surge in net profit in the first half of the year, and its revenue jumped 204.4% year on year to 13.88 billion yuan ($1.93 billion). In 2024, roughly $423 million of the company's global revenue came from Labubu dolls alone, Pop Mart previously told CNBC Make It. Meanwhile, Jellycat saw its revenue rise 66% to £333 million in 2024, up from £200 million in 2023. Its profit before tax more than doubled to £139 million, up from £67 million the prior year. \"Seeing the response across multiple generations to our new characters has been wonderful,\" Jellycat's CEO Arnaud Meysselle said in a statement to CNBC. \"It's been amazing to meet so many adults discovering Jellycat for the first time at our recent experience launches in Beijing, Seoul, and Los Angeles — and to welcome many others into our online communities,\" Meysselle said. 'Peter Pan effect' Guests attend the Jellycat X Selfridges Amuseables Bag launch in London, England.Dave Benett | Dave Benett Collection | Getty ImagesFans of Jellycat, Labubu, and plushies in general span from corporate workers to military personnel who tout the benefits the toys have on their mental health on TikTok, as they grapple with increasingly stressful adult lives. Circana's Symonds said that this is a symptom of the \"Peter Pan effect\" which refers to a psychological syndrome where adults struggle to grow up and take on responsibilities. \"There's almost this irony that when you're a kid, you can't wait to grow up, but then when you're an adult, you realize that being a kid was the best time of your life,\" she said. \"There's a bit of that Peter Pan effect where they [Gen Z consumers] don't want to grow up, but I think it's just holding on to that joy element that brings them happiness.\" Gen Z adults have had it fairly rough as a generation as many say they were priced out of the adulthood they were promised. Economic and geopolitical turmoil has disrupted their lives, footage of war replays on their social media feeds everyday, and the cost of living continues to skyrocket. Some of the conflicts they've seen through their adult lives include the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022, to the Israel-Hamas war. And to top it all off, rising inflation means their buying power decreases every day with economic milestones like buying a house or starting a family feeling out of reach. Many Gen Z are instead \"doom spending\" to fill the gap. This refers to a phenomenon where people splash out on small luxuries like travel, designer goods, or even expensive toys because they know they might never be able to afford bigger milestones like owning a home or even children. Delaying parenthood also means Gen Z have more disposable income to spend on small luxuries. \"I think some of it might be because they're [Gen Z] choosing to have kids slightly older, so they've got a slightly longer period of time where they have money coming in, but don't necessarily have to spend it on schools or lunch boxes, so they're choosing to spend it on themselves to bring themselves some happiness,\" Symonds said.'Part of the community' Alongside economic woes, Gen Z have also struggled with loneliness and for some, buying and collecting toys can help them feel like they're part of a community. Some 85% of British Gen Z reported experiencing feelings of loneliness, according to a Hinge survey that polled 2,000 Gen Z adults in the U.K. in March. More than half of low-income young adults experienced severe loneliness, according to the research. Jellycat's Meysselle explained that the brand has looked to create a community for its fans from launching Instagram and TikTok accounts in 2022, both of which have racked up over two million followers since. Jellycat Fish & Chips Experience at Selfridges, London.Tim CharlesIts also invested in themed pop-up experiences that fans can visit in person from Jellycat Fish & Chips in Selfridges in London, to Jellycat Patisserie in Galeries Lafayette in Paris, and Jellycat Diner in FAO Schwarz in New York. Around 80% of fans that turned up to Jellycat's Space Experience in Seoul that was launched in November, were in their 20s and 30s — the largest percentage of adults at a Jellycat experience so far. Selfridges' toy buyer Joe Evans told CNBC Make It that Jellycat is its fastest selling toy brand and in the past two years there's been \"a meteoric rise\" in Gen Z and millennial customers who want to \"feel like they're part of a community and collect,\" toys. \"When you purchase a Jellycat, you feel like you're part of a community, you feel like you're part of something, there are a lot of groups online that talk, and people race each other for the best and the newest product,\" he added.

Samuel Corum | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesGreenland Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen on Monday rebuked President Donald Trump's appointment of a special envoy to Greenland, the U.S. president's latest move in his long-running effort to acquire the autonomous island territory of Denmark. \"Greenland belongs to the Greenlandic people, and territorial integrity must be respected,\" Nielsen said in a statement. \"We are happy to cooperate with other countries, including the United States, but this must always take place with respect for us and for our values and wishes.\"Trump on Sunday appointed Louisiana's Republican Gov.

Trump has long sought to acquire Greenland from Denmark, first floating the idea in his first term due to the island's strategic location and rich mineral bounty. He made a push again for the island when he was reelected in 2024, but was rebuked by both Greenland and Denmark despite dispatching Vice President J.D. Vance to the island in March.The Danish Foreign Minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen on Monday said he was \"deeply upset\" by Landry's appointment and that he would summon the U.S. ambassador to Denmark over it.

    "body": "Still from Disney's \"Avatar: Fire and Ash.\"DisneyThe opening weekend for Disney's \"Avatar: Fire and Ash\" was less of a blaze and more of a simmer.And that's the expectation for the full theatrical run of the third installment in James Cameron's Avatar franchise. During its first three days in theaters, \"Fire and Ash\" tallied $88 million, falling well shy of analysts' expectations, which called for a debut haul between $110 million and $125 million. For comparison, 2022's \"Avatar: The Way of Water\" brought in $134 million during the same three-day period.Internationally, the film collected $257 million, bringing the film's global opening to an estimated $345 million.\"Fire and Ash\" faced some theatrical headwinds, namely its over-three-hour runtime. There was also less pent-up demand compared to \"The Way of Water,\" which was released more than a decade after the first Avatar film. Some box office analysts and critics noted that \"Fire and Ash\" has less technological innovation than its predecessors, which had been a driving factor in past ticket sales.Around 5.2 million domestic moviegoers went to see \"Fire and Ash,\" according to data from EntTelligence, a massive decline from the 8.7 million that ventured out in 2022 to see the opening weekend of \"The Way of Water.\"Still, the Avatar franchise has never been front-loaded at the box office. The first film, 2009's \"Avatar,\" generated just $77 million in its opening weekend domestically, but stayed in theaters for nearly a year. By the time it exited theaters, the film had generated $2.7 billion globally. With re-releases, the film now stands at $2.9 billion, according to data from Comscore.\"The Way of Water\" ran in theaters for 23 weeks and has grossed $2.3 billion globally.\"With less than two weeks remaining in the box office year, the pressure on 'Avatar: Fire And Ash' to deliver big was intense and though the film may have come in a bit below pre-release opening weekend projections, the Avatar films have always been known for their marathon box office trajectories,\" said Paul Dergarabedian, head of marketplace trends at Comscore.Also aiding the franchise at the box office are premium large-format ticket sales. The Avatar films have over-indexed with the more expensive experiential screens like IMAX and Dolby as well as 3D showings. Disney reported that 3D and premium theaters accounted for 66% of the weekend total.While 3D films have fallen out of favor with domestic audiences, they remain popular internationally —especially in China. Indeed, \"Avatar\" made the bulk of its money outside the U.S., with a whopping $2.08 billion coming from overseas.",

    "body": "A Waymo vehicle stuck between Parker and Beaumont, on the north side of Turk Boulevard in San Francisco.Credit: Matt SchoolfieldAlphabet-owned Waymo has resumed its driverless ride-hail service in the San Francisco Bay Area after a temporary pause during blackouts that plagued the city beginning on Saturday afternoon.\"Yesterday's power outage was a widespread event that caused gridlock across San Francisco, with non-functioning traffic signals and transit disruptions,\" a Waymo spokesperson, Suzanne Philion, told CNBC in an e-mailed statement Sunday afternoon. \"While the failure of the utility infrastructure was significant, we are committed to ensuring our technology adjusts to traffic flow during such events,\" she added.Waymo notice of service outage in San Francisco. Source: WaymoAs power outages spread yesterday, videos shared on social media appeared to show multiple Waymo vehicles stalled in traffic in different parts of the city.San Francisco resident Matt Schoolfield said he saw at least three Waymo autonomous vehicles stopped in traffic Saturday between 6 p.m. and 9:45 p.m. local time, including one he photographed on Turk Boulevard near Parker Avenue.\"They were just stopping in the middle of the street,\" Schoolfield said.The power outages began around 1:09 p.m. Saturday and peaked roughly two hours later, affecting about 130,000 customers, according to Pacific Gas and Electric. As of Sunday morning, about 21,000 customers remained without power, mainly in the Presidio, the Richmond District, Golden Gate Park and parts of downtown San Francisco.PG&E said the outage was caused by a fire at a substation that resulted in \"significant and extensive\" damage, and said it could not yet provide a precise timeline for full restoration.San Francisco Mayor Daniel Lurie said in a 9 p.m. update on X that police officers, fire crews, parking control officers and city ambassadors were deployed across affected neighborhoods.\"While the Waymo Driver is designed to treat non-functional signals as four-way stops, the sheer scale of the outage led to instances where vehicles remained stationary longer than usual to confirm the state of the affected intersections,\" Waymo's Philion also told CNBC. \"This contributed to traffic friction during the height of the congestion.\" Waymo \"closely coordinated with San Francisco city officials,\" she said, and proactively paused its service as of Saturday evening and in the first half of the day on Sunday. \"The majority of active trips were successfully completed before vehicles were safely returned to depots or pulled over,\" she noted.Amid the disruption, Tesla CEO Elon Musk posted on X: \"Tesla Robotaxis were unaffected by the SF power outage.\"Unlike Waymo, Tesla does not operate a driverless robotaxi service in San Francisco.Tesla's local ride-hailing service uses vehicles equipped with \"FSD (Supervised),\" a premium driver assistance system. The service requires a human driver behind the wheel at all times. According to state regulators — including the California Department of Motor Vehicles and California Public Utilities Commission — Tesla has not obtained permits to conduct driverless testing or services in the state without human safety supervisors behind the wheel, ready to steer or brake at any time.Tesla is vying to become a robotaxi titan, but does not yet operate commercial, driverless services. Tesla's Robotaxi app allows users to hail a ride; however, its vehicles currently have human safety supervisors or drivers on board, even in states where the company has obtained permits for driverless operations. Waymo, which leads the nascent industry in the West, is Tesla's chief competitor in AVs, along with Chinese players like Baidu-owned Apollo Go.The outage-related disruptions in San Francisco come as robotaxi services are becoming more common in other major U.S. cities. Waymo is among a small number of companies operating fully driverless ride-hailing services for the public, even as unease about autonomous vehicles remains high.A survey by the American Automobile Association earlier this year found that about two-thirds of U.S. drivers said they were fearful of autonomous vehicles.The Waymo pause in San Francisco indicates cities are not yet ready for highly automated vehicles to inundate their streets, said Bryan Reimer, a research scientist at the MIT Center for Transportation and co-author of \"How to Make AI Useful.\"\"Something in the design and development of this technology was missed that clearly illustrates it was not the robust solution many would like to believe it is,\" he said.Reimer noted that power outages are entirely predictable. \"Not for eternity, but in the foreseeable future, we will need to mix human and machine intelligence, and have human backup systems in place around highly automated systems, including robotaxis,\" he said.State and city regulators will need to consider what the maximum penetration of highly automated vehicles should be in their region, Reimer added, and AV developers should be held responsible for \"chaos gridlock,\" just as human drivers would be held responsible for how they drive during a blackout.— CNBC's Riya Bhattacharjee contributed reporting from San Francisco.",

    "body": "The logo of South Korean shipbuilder Hanwha Ocean at their office building in Seoul, South Korea, October 15, 2025. Kim Hong-ji | ReutersShares of South Korean firm Hanwha Ocean surged 10% Tuesday after U.S. President Donald Trump announced that the firm would help build new frigates for the country's Navy. Speaking at a press conference, Trump said that the warships will be built at the Hanwha Philly Shipyard in Philadelphia, acquired by the South Korean company in 2024, and in which it has pledged to invest $5 billion as part of South Korea's $150 billion shipbuilding pledge. The shipbuilding pledge is part of the broader U.S.-South Korea trade deal that saw tariffs reduced on South Korean exports to 15%, in exchange for a $350 billion investment pledge from Seoul, among other concessions. Hanwha Ocean is one of South Korea's major shipbuilding firms, having expertise in building commercial ships such as LNG carriers, as well as and military naval platforms including submarines and surface vessels. South Korean defense stocks have been on a roll this year, with major defense players such as Hanhwa Aerospace and Hyundai Rotem gaining over 170% and 270%, respectively year to date. Hanhwa Ocean has surged more 220% so far this year. watch nowLast week, the U.S. Navy announced the FF(X) class of ships — smaller combatant ships — which it said will complement larger, multi-mission warships and enhance operational flexibility around the globe. Secretary of the Navy John Phelan said the new frigate class would be part of Trump's envisioned \"Golden Fleet.\"Trump on Monday stateside said that the U.S. Navy will build two new \"Trump-class\" battleships, and may expand the count to as much as 25 such ships. The U.S. president described the ships as \"some of the most lethal surface warfare ships,\" adding that the they will \"help maintain American military supremacy, [and] inspire fear in America's enemies all over the world.\"Describing them as \"the fastest, the biggest, and by far, 100 times more powerful than any battleship ever built,\" the Trump-class battleships are envisioned to be equipped with hypersonic weapons, lasers, cruise missiles, and nuclear weapons, according to the U.S. President.",

Spot gold was up 1.99% to $4,440.26 per ounce. Prices are up nearly 70% since the start of the year.The metal has soared this year, smashing consecutive price records as risk assets lost ground.

Schumer's announcement came three days after the DOJ missed last week's deadline to release all of the documents required by the Epstein Files Transparency Act, which President Donald Trump signed into law in November. All documents were required by the law to be released on Friday with minimal redactions. Only a fraction of the total files relating to Epstein have been released so far. \"Instead of transparency, the Trump administration released a tiny fraction of the files and blacked out massive portions of what little they provided,\" Schumer said in a statement. \"Republicans should again show that same support for upholding the bipartisan law we passed and demand the Trump administration release all the Epstein files.\"Schumer's resolution would force Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., to \"initiate or intervene in one or more civil actions in the name of the Senate in a Federal Court of competent jurisdiction\" to compel the release of the Epstein files. Schumer intends to force consideration of the resolution when the Senate reconvenes in the New Year. Senate Republicans previously joined with Democrats to unanimously pass the law requiring the release of the Epstein files. Over the weekend, several photos, including one that contained images of Trump's face, were removed from the Justice Department's repository for the Epstein files. The photos were later restored. Trump has long denied any wrongdoing in association with Epstein.

The DOJ has defended its rollout of the Epstein files, arguing it is working to review and redact material required by the law to protect the privacy of Epstein's victims. \"This is an arduous process, as each document and photograph must be individually reviewed by the DOJ and the Southern District of New York for potential redactions to protect victims or potential victims,\" the DOJ said in a fact sheet. CNBC has reached out to the Justice Department for comment on Schumer's resolution. Other members of Congress who pushed for the release of the Epstein files, including Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., have threatened to begin impeachment proceedings against Attorney General Pam Bondi and Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche over the rollout of the Epstein Files. CNBC is reaching out to the people identified in the photos or mentioned in the latest release of the Epstein files. All have denied wrongdoing previously.

Tiffany Hagler-Geard | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesInstacart said Monday it will cease the use of artificial intelligence-driven pricing tests on its grocery delivery platform after the practice was scrutinized in a wide-ranging study and rebuked by lawmakers. The company said in a blog post that retailers will no longer be able to use its Eversight technology to run pricing experiments on its platform, effective immediately. \"We understand that the tests we ran with a small number of retail partners that resulted in different prices for the same item at the same store missed the mark for some customers,\" the company wrote. \"At a time when families are working exceptionally hard to stretch every grocery dollar, those tests raised concerns, leaving some people questioning the prices they see on Instacart. That's not okay – especially for a company built on trust, transparency, and affordability.\"Instacart acquired Eversight for $59 million in 2022. Eversight's software allows retailers to carry out pricing tests to gauge shoppers' reactions to higher or lower prices on certain items.

The total cost for the same basket of goods at a single store varied by about 7%, which can result in more than $1,000 in extra annual costs for customers. Instacart responded by saying that retailers determine prices listed on the app.The company also rejected characterizations of the technology as surveillance pricing or dynamic pricing, and said the tests were never based on personal, demographic or individual-level user data. Reuters reported last week that the Federal Trade Commission had sent a civil investigative demand to Instacart about its pricing practices. Separately, Instacart last week was ordered to pay $60 million in refunds to customers to settle claims raised by the FTC that it used deceptive tactics in its subscription sign-up, \"satisfaction guarantee\" advertising and other processes.

Discovery — a clear response to questions raised by the WBD board of directors. \"Larry Ellison has agreed to provide an irrevocable personal guarantee of $40.4 billion of the equity financing for the offer and any damages claims against Paramount,\" the company said in a news release. Paramount said Ellison, the father of Paramount CEO David Ellison, has also agreed not to revoke the Ellison family trust or adversely transfer its assets during a pending transaction. The guarantee does not replace committed funds from RedBird Capital and sovereign wealth funds, but constitutes a new layer of security for the commitments. Paramount Skydance is offering $30 per share, all cash, for Warner Bros. Discovery in a hostile attempt that's meant to rival an agreement with Netflix. Last week, Warner Bros. Discovery Chairman Samuel Di Piazza told CNBC's David Faber the board had concerns about the supposed backing of Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison in the bid. \"We were not confident that one of the richest people in the world would be there at closing,\" Di Piazza said at the time. \"Doing a deal is great; closing a deal is better.\"WBD earlier this month agreed to sell its studio and streaming assets to Netflix in a transaction valued at roughly $83 billion on an enterprise basis. Paramount wants to buy the entirety of WBD, including its portfolio of TV networks, and says its offer comes with an enterprise value of $108.4 billion.Paramount notably did not increase its bid on Monday, reiterating that it believes the deal is superior, though Paramount did hike its proposed reverse breakup fee to match that of Netflix's offer. WBD confirmed receipt of the amended offer on Monday and said in a release it would \"carefully review and consider Paramount Skydance's offer in accordance with the terms of Warner Bros. Discovery's agreement with Netflix.\" \"What we've done in this amended filing is we've cleared the brush of obfuscation around the offer,\" said Gerry Cardinale, founder and managing partner of RedBird Capital Partners, on CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" on Monday. watch nowRedBird is an investor in Paramount Skydance and has also committed to financing the proposed Paramount acquisition of WBD. Cardinale said Monday that as part of the amended filing Larry Ellison would back the bid through an irrevocable trust, which is anchored by 1.2 billion Oracle shares. \"Like we've done through the six bids that we've made, we are being responsive to what their concerns are,\" Cardinale said.Shares of Warner Bros. Discovery rose 3% in early trading Monday, while Paramount gained more than 7%. Netflix's stock was down nearly 1%. Paramount vs. Netflix Paramount made three offers for WBD in the fall, which were all rejected by the company. WBD then launched a formal sale process that brought in offers from other bidders, including Netflix. Cardinale said Paramount's unsolicited offers likely spurred WBD to open up to a sale, putting Paramount \"a little bit on the back foot.\"During Monday's CNBC interview Cardinale, like Ellison on CNBC last week, appealed directly to WBD shareholders. \"At the end of the day ... the shareholders own this company. The board doesn't own it. [CEO] David Zaslav doesn't own this company,\" said Cardinale. \"This should be a lot more simple than it is. It's very simple.\"Besides the question of value between the two bids, the question of regulatory approval has also been raised by Paramount as well as industry onlookers. \"The Netflix deal kills competition,\" Cardinale said, adding that a combination of streaming platforms Netflix and HBO Max would create 420 million subscribers under one roof. \"No wonder the constituents in the ecosystem — talent, creators, theatrical exhibitors —  are losing their minds on this because they see the pricing power that they will create.\" Netflix co-CEOs Ted Sarandos and Greg Peters have said they are confident their deal would pass regulatory muster. Sarandos has also issued reassurances about the future of the theatrical slate for WBD under Netflix's ownership. At a conference earlier in December, Sarandos argued the Netflix offer for WBD's assets would preserve jobs at a time of mounting layoffs across the industry. ",

    "body": "watch nowGoogle parent Alphabet on Monday announced it will acquire Intersect, a data center and energy infrastructure company, for $4.75 billion in cash in addition to the assumption of debt.Alphabet said Intersect's operations will remain independent, but that the acquisition will help bring more data center and generation capacity online faster. In recent years, Google has been embroiled in a fierce competition with artificial intelligence rivals, namely OpenAI, which kick-started the generative AI boom with the launch of its ChatGPT chatbot in 2022. OpenAI has made more than $1.4 trillion of infrastructure commitments to build out the data centers it needs to meet growing demand for its technology. With its acquisition of Intersect, Google is looking to keep up.\"Intersect will help us expand capacity, operate more nimbly in building new power generation in lockstep with new data center load, and reimagine energy solutions to drive US innovation and leadership,\" Sundar Pichai, CEO of Google and Alphabet, said in a statement.

In a release at the time, Intersect said its strategic partnership with Google and TPG Rise Climate aimed to develop gigawatts of data center capacity across the U.S., including a $20 billion investment in renewable power infrastructure by the end of the decade.Alphabet said Monday that Intersect will work closely with Google's technical infrastructure team, including on the companies' co-located power site and data center in Haskell County, Texas. Google previously announced a $40 billion investment in Texas through 2027, which includes new data center campuses in the state's Haskell and Armstrong counties.Intersect's operating and in-development assets in California and its existing operating assets in Texas are not part of the acquisition, Alphabet said. Intersect's existing investors including TPG Rise Climate, Climate Adaptive Infrastructure and Greenbelt Capital Partners will support those assets, and they will continue to operate as an independent company.Alphabet's acquisition of Intersect is expected to close in the first half of 2026, but it is still subject to customary closing conditions.WATCH: Here’s what’s happening to electricity bills in states with the most data centerswatch now",

    "body": "We often underestimate how much our morning rituals can set the tone for the rest of the day. When you prioritize activities that spark a natural dopamine release, you aren't just waking up — you're essentially giving your brain a head start on feeling motivated and balanced.\"Dopamine is a neurotransmitter, which is a chemical released by brain cells, and it's mostly involved in motivation, learning and reinforcement,\" says Mia Soviero, a neuroscience researcher who conducted research at NYU Langone Health and Columbia University's Zuckerman Institute.\"It isn't just about feeling good. It's mostly about learning and motivating you. So, it helps our brain understand what actions are worth repeating and what habits we should have in our lives that we should strengthen,\" says Soviero, who also founded the nonprofit Research Girl, Inc to help aspiring science researchers receive more opportunities in their field of interest.A common misconception is that dopamine levels are always supposed to be boosted, Soviero says: Neurotransmitter levels are meant to fluctuate.\"We don't want to always have really high dopamine levels, but we do want to have a healthy dopamine system,\" she says. \"You just want to build these good patterns in dopamine, where dopamine is able to be released the way it's supposed to.\"Here's how Soviero structures her mornings to keep her dopamine system healthy, she says.A neuroscience researcher's dopamine-boosting morning routineStep 1: Exposure to sunlightSoviero's ideal morning routine for the best mood starts the night before: Getting adequate sleep sets the tone for the next day, she explains.Then, \"I make sure that when I wake up, I get exposure to some light in the morning,\" she says. \"Opening your curtains in the morning and getting sunlight on your face for a few minutes have actually been scientifically proven to reduce depressive symptoms, especially if you have seasonal depression.\"Sunlight exposure directly affects the area of your brain that controls your body's internal clock, or your circadian rhythm, according to Harvard Health Publishing.Not getting enough exposure to sunlight each day \"can cause your brain to produce too much of the sleep hormone melatonin and to release less serotonin, the feel-good brain chemical that affects mood. The result of this chemical imbalance? You feel low and lethargic,\" the health blog states.Step 2: SudokuSoviero makes time in her mornings to do \"small, meaningful activities\" like completing a daily Sudoku puzzle.\"It's a great way to kick off the day with a little dopamine from doing a puzzle. It's that feel-good chemical from achieving [it],\" she says. \"Novelty and new things that you aren't expecting that are good can increase dopamine levels in the brain and contribute to dopamine health. So that's why puzzles are great.\"Solving crossword puzzles and physical puzzles can have the same effects on your brain, Soviero says: The brain has a reward system that boosts dopamine when \"something unexpectedly good happens, and then decreases when something worse than expected happens.\"\"This means that evolutionarily, we would strive for goals in the hopes that we'd get this feel good chemical as a reward,\" she says. \"So when you do something, [like] learning a new skill, and you're surprisingly good at it, you get this influx of dopamine.\"Step 3: Text a friendEach morning, Soviero practices a simple and significant form of social connection: texting a friend. \"I'll send a text to my friends [like], 'Hey, good morning. How are you doing today?'\" she says.\"Humans are biologically wired for connections,\" Soviero adds. \"When you get to make that human connection, it's scientifically proven to boost your mood because that's what we're supposed to be doing.\" Spending too much time without interacting with close loved ones like friends and family can harm your health, she says. Being socially isolated and feeling lonely can increase a person's risk of developing heart disease, dementia, depression and other chronic conditions, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.Connecting with others is \"really healthy, not only for your brain but also for your body,\" Soviero says.Want to give your kids the ultimate advantage?

    "body": "Dominion Energy's wind turbines located 27 miles off of Virginia Beach in the Atlantic Ocean, July 17, 2023.Kendall Warner | Virginian Pilot | Getty ImagesThe Trump administration on Monday halted Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind, the largest project of its kind in the U.S., as well as four other projects under construction off the East Coast in a devastating blow to the wind industry. Shares of Dominion Energy, the utility developing the Virginia project, dropped nearly 4% on the news. The administration also paused leases for Vineyard Wind 1 off Massachusetts, Revolution Wind off Rhode Island, Sunrise Wind off Long Island and New England, and Empire Wind 1 south of Long Island. The projects taken together would provide enough power for more than 2 million homes, according to statements from the developers. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum said the administration paused leases for the projects due to national security concerns identified by the Pentagon. watch nowShares of Denmark's Orsted, the developer of the Revolution and Sunrise projects, tumbled 11%. Norway's Equinor, the developer of Empire Wind 1, fell about 1%. Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind is a 176 turbine project project that would provide enough power for more than 600,000 homes, according to Dominion. The project was expected to be complete next year. Dominion said the massive project is essential for U.S. national security and Virginia's dramatically growing energy needs. Northern Virginia is the largest hub for data centers in the world. Growing demand from artificial intelligence is contributing to higher electricity prices in the state. \"Stopping CVOW for any length of time will threaten grid reliability for some of the nation's most important war fighting, AI, and civilian assets,\" Dominion said in a statement. \"It will also lead to energy inflation and threaten thousands of jobs,\" the utility said.  Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin, a Republican, supports the project. Incoming Gov. Abigail Spanberger, a Democrat, won the gubernatorial election in November on a promise to address rising electricity costs in part by expanding renewable energy. The Interior Department said in a statement that the pause will give the federal government time to \"work with leaseholders and state partners to assess the possibility of mitigating the national security risks posed by these projects.\" watch nowInterior said the U.S. government found that turbine blades and \"highly reflective towers\" create radar interference risk. \"The clutter caused by offshore wind projects obscures legitimate moving targets and generates false targets in the vicinity of the wind projects,\" Interior said. President Donald Trump has targeted the U.S. wind industry since his first day in office. Trump on Jan. 20 ordered a halt to all new leases and permits for onshore and offshore wind pending federal review. Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., condemned Trump's campaign against wind projects as \"irrational.\" The senate minority leader said Interior's decision would spike energy bills.  \"Trump's obsession with killing offshore wind projects is unhinged, irrational, and unjustified,\" Schumer said in a statement Monday. \"At a time of soaring energy costs, this latest decision from DOI is a backwards step that will drive energy bills even higher.\" Trump's campaign against the wind industry has run afoul of the courts. Judge Patti Saris of the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts ruled on Dec. 8 that Trump's order was \"arbitrary and capricious and contrary to law.\"",

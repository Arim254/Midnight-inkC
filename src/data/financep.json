(Photo by Philippe LOPEZ / AFP via Getty Images)Philippe Lopez | Afp | Getty ImagesIndia approved the purchase of Rafale fighter jets from France on Thursday, marking one of its largest aircraft orders, ahead of French President Emmanuel Macron's visit to the country.The approval was part of New Delhi's 3.6 trillion rupee ($39.7 billion) defence spending package covering multiple acquisitions across the armed forces.The Defence Ministry did not specify how many aircraft would be ordered. Local media reported that India will purchase 114 Rafale jets, with 18 supplied by manufacturer Dassault and the remaining 96 manufactured domestically.The broader package includes Boeing P8I Poseidon reconnaissance aircraft for its navy, anti-tank mines for its ground forces, and upgrades to its Soviet-era T-72 tanks and BMP-2 infantry fighting vehicles.The new aircraft are expected to help address a shortfall in the Indian air force, which operates 29 squadrons against a minimum requirement of 42, according to a 2024 parliamentary report. The air force most recently retired two squadrons of Cold War-era MiG-21 fighters in September 2025, and is expected to phase out additional aircraft in the coming years.The Rafale purchase follows another order in April for 26 Rafale-Marine fighters for India's Navy. Dassault said India would become the first user outside France to operate this variant. Rafale jets were used by the Indian Air Force during its 2025 conflict with Pakistan, when at least one aircraft was reported lost in combat against Islamabad's Chinese-made J-10Cs.Macron, who will be in India from Feb. 17 to 19, is scheduled to meet Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi to discuss expanding bilateral cooperation across sectors.The two leaders will also launch the India-France Year of Innovation and attend the AI Impact Summit in New Delhi, according to India's external affairs ministry.\"The leaders will discuss regional and global issues of mutual interest, including cooperation in the Indo-Pacific,\" the release added.

    "body": "A logo sits illuminated outside the Cisco booth at ISE 2024 on January 30, 2024 in Barcelona, Spain.Cesc Maymo | Getty ImagesCisco Systems shares closed 12% lower Thursday as rising memory prices put pressure on the networking company's margins. It's the stock's worst day since 2022.Strong demand for artificial intelligence data centers has led to a global shortage of memory, which has caused costs to skyrocket for the component. Large orders for data center memory have limited production capacity for other devices, including smartphones.This has created uncertainty for a number of tech companies, including consumer electronics makers like Apple and Dell as well as chipmakers like Qualcomm, which cited the shortage when it issued weak guidance on Feb. 4. Now, Cisco is feeling the pinch. Cisco CEO Chuck Robbins addressed memory price increases across the market on the company's earnings call on Wednesday. Robbins said Cisco will raise prices, revise contracts and negotiate terms to account for the evolving component prices. \"In terms of memory, we're going to control what we can control,\" Cisco finance chief Mark Patterson said on the call.The company reported better-than-expected quarterly results on Wednesday, but shares dropped about 7% as Cisco issued a mediocre forecast.Product gross margin for the quarter was 66.4%, down 130 bps from the year prior, which Patterson said was \"primarily driven by negative impacts from mix and higher memory costs.\"Read more CNBC tech newsTech IPO hype gets drowned out on Wall Street by prospect of $1 trillion in debt salesFTC tells Tim Cook to look into reports Apple News is censoring conservativesAnthropic closes $30 billion funding round as cash keeps flowing into top AI startupsWaymo begins deploying next-gen Ojai robotaxis to extend its U.S. lead",

    "body": "Tractor trailers sit parked at a J.B. Hunt Transport Services Inc. facility in Columbus, Ohio.Luke Sharrett | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesShares of several trucking and logistics companies declined Thursday on fears that new artificial intelligence tools could slash major freight inefficiencies, leading to less demand for the industry's services.A new tool from AI company Algorhythm Holdings has made trucking companies the latest victim of the market's AI jitters, adding to the historic sell-off in software stocks and real estate companies. The notable market rotation has come as investors are increasingly scrutinizing traditional businesses that may not be able to keep up with rapid advancements in AI.Leading trucking and logistics stocks C.H. Robinson and RXO dropped 14.5% and 20.5%, respectively, during Thursday's session. J.B. Hunt Transportation Services declined about 5%, while XPO lost nearly 6% and logistics company Expeditors International of Washington fell about 13.2%.There's an \"emerging debate around open-source automation agents such as Molt Bot that offer increased potential to automate routine back-office tasks and help equalize the technology playing field for smaller operators,\" said Baird analyst Daniel Moore in a note. He reiterated his outperform ratings on C.H. Robinson and Expeditors, saying \"automation is not a new theme.\"Shares of Algorhythm, a penny stock before Thursday, popped 29.9%, meanwhile.Algorhythm announced earlier this week that its SemiCab's platform, deployed with live customers, is allowing operators to scale freight volumes by 300% to 400% without increasing their headcount. According to its press release, the SemiCab platform reduces \"empty freight miles\" by more than 70% across active customer networks. The company said that trucks are driving empty nearly one out of every three miles and therefore lose more than $1 trillion in freight spending each year, citing data from Mordor Intelligence.\"What we're proving with SemiCab is that when freight is managed as a coordinated network rather than isolated transactions, utilization improves dramatically. The substantial reduction in empty miles that we are able to achieve for our customers represents a fundamental shift in how logistics economics work,\" said Ajesh Kapoor, CEO of SemiCab.Algorhythm was previously focused on developing in-car karaoke systems, but sold its Singing Machine business to Stingray for $4.5 million in 2025 before pivoting to its AI freight platform.Separately, investors are watching to see how trucking companies could also be impacted by U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean P. Duffy's Wednesday ruling to prohibit, according to the announcement, \"unqualified foreign drivers\" from obtaining licenses to drive commercial trucks and buses. Duffy said that government reforms will seek to address safety concerns by preventing \"foreign drivers\" who have not undergone consular and interagency screening from receiving a commercial driver's license. Consular screening typically applies to non-U.S. citizens.",

    "body": "Chinese tech company Baidu, best known for its search engine, also operates cloud, mapping and other internet-based services.Bloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesBEIJING — Baidu plans to give users of its main smartphone app direct access to the wildly popular artificial intelligence tool OpenClaw, according to a spokesperson for the Chinese tech company.Starting later on Friday, users who opt in can message the AI agent through Baidu's main search app to complete tasks such as scheduling, organizing files and writing code. AI agents such as OpenClaw have surged in popularity recently for their ability to automate tasks, including managing email and using online services. Previously, the Austrian-developed open-sourced AI agent could only be accessed from chat apps such as WhatsApp or Telegram. Chinese companies such as Alibaba, Tencent and Baidu have already allowed users to run OpenClaw on their cloud systems.Baidu claims 700 million monthly active users for its search app. The company is also rolling out OpenClaw's capabilities to its e-commerce business and other services.The rollout comes just days ahead of China's Lunar New Year holiday, as Chinese internet tech giants race to attract new users and monetize their AI investments. \n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tWeekly analysis and insights from Asia's largest economy in your inbox\n\t\t\tSubscribe now\n\t\t\n\tAlibaba has also integrated its e-commerce platforms, such as Taobao and travel site Fliggy, with its AI chatbot Qwen, and claimed it received more than 120 million consumer orders through the app in the six days through Feb. 11. Qwen users can compare personalized product recommendations before completing payment through Alipay — all within the chatbot. Previously, the AI tool could suggest products based on prompts, but shoppers had to leave the app and navigate multiple platforms to complete their transactions.Despite growing interest in AI agents such as OpenClaw, cybersecurity firms including CrowdStrike have warned the public about granting OpenClaw unfettered access to enterprise systems.",

    "body": "As geopolitical tensions between the EU and the U.S. escalate, these charts show how reliant the continent is on American tech providers, despite pledges to become more independent.Since returning to the White House last year, U.S President Donald Trump imposed tariffs on the continent and caused headaches and fear in Europe as he initially refused to rule out military action to acquire Greenland, a semi-autonomous Danish territory, before backtracking.With the long-standing transatlantic alliance looking uncertain, European governments are increasingly moving to develop digital autonomy. Critics of Europe's reliance on U.S. companies for digital infrastructure warn that U.S. law enforcement can request user data from American companies, regardless of where the data is stored, as part of the Cloud Act.But tech providers from the other side of the Atlantic still dominate in Europe.European cloud providers have been steadily losing ground to U.S. rivals over the past nine years, holding under 15% of the market in 2025, according to data from Synergy Research Group, a market analytics company.\"It will be incredibly difficult for European cloud providers to meaningfully reverse the market share trend,\" John Dinsdale, the group's chief analyst, told CNBC.\"This is a game of scale. In order to be a leading player, you have to be continually investing large amounts in research, service development, technical infrastructure, customer support and channel partners,\" he added. \"You also have to have the brand recognition and ability to operate globally or at least across multiple geographies.\"Amazon, Microsoft and Google control more than 70% of the European cloud market, while the European companies with the largest share of the market are German duo SAP and Deutsche Telekom, with 2% each, per Synergy data.\"If you were able to go back 10 years and rewrite history, maybe one or two European companies could and should have set out their stall to be a leading player in the cloud market, but they didn't,\" said Dinsdale. Amazon gained a huge early mover advantage by acting first in the market, he said, adding that Microsoft and Google followed at a distance. \"Oracle eventually got serious about the cloud and is now growing rapidly, and neocloud companies are targeting specific services with some success.\"While SAP commands the biggest share of Europe's enterprise software market, at least 59% is held by U.S companies, according to data from a December report by the European Parliament, with Oracle and Microsoft controlling 18% and 10%, respectively. The enterprise software market data refers to Europe as a whole, including non-EU members such as the UK and Switzerland.Many political leaders are now \"looking at technology in a way to gain sovereignty,\" SAP CEO Christian Klein told CNBC's \"Squawk Box Europe\" on Friday, in terms of \"not only where do we store the data and how we manage the data, but also how to gain sovereignty on the software side.\"Customer relationship management software is a sector dominated by a single player in Salesforce, with SAP taking second spot, data from the European Parliament report, referring just to the 27 members of the European Union, showed.",

    "body": "Dado Ruvic | ReutersPinterest shares plunged as much as 20% after hours Thursday as CEO Bill Ready said the company \"absorbed an exogenous shock this year related to tariffs\" that affected top retail advertisers.The company reported a fourth-quarter earnings miss, revenue that was roughly in line with expectations and issued weak guidance for the current period.Here's how the company did, compared to analysts' consensus estimates from LSEG:Earnings per share: 67 cents adjusted vs. 69 cents expectedRevenue: $1.32 billion vs. $1.33 billion expectedReady told analysts on Thursday that the company is \"not satisfied with our Q4 revenue performance, and believe it does not reflect what Pinterest can deliver over time.\"The company's fourth-quarter sales rose 14% year-to-year. Net income for the fourth quarter came in at $277 million, down 85% from a year prior, when net income was $1.85 billion and included a deferred tax benefit.  This is the second quarter in a row in which Pinterest shed a fifth of its value after delivering Wall Street disappointing results. The impact of tariffs on large retailers \"created a more meaningful headwind than we expected,\" Pinterest finance chief Julia Donnelly said on the call with analysts. Those retailers also pulled back on ad spend in Europe, she said.The retail sector has been reeling from President Donald Trump's ongoing trade war, which raised the price of shipping costs. The trade war has also led to companies charging customers higher prices and reducing the number of products they can put on the market. Besides implementing layoffs, the retail sector also pulled back on advertising to deal with the ongoing trade issues.Pinterest said it expects first-quarter sales to come in between $951 million to $971 million, trailing analyst estimates of $980 million.\"Looking ahead to Q1, we expect these headwinds will continue and may become slightly more pronounced in Q1, including in the U.K. and in Europe,\" Donnelly said.Pinterest recorded $541.5 million in adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or EBIDTA. That figure fell short of the $550 million that analysts were projecting.While Pinterest sees \"opportunity over the long term\" from large advertisers, Ready said \"the near-term outlook for this cohort on our platform remains pressured given these headwinds.\"The company plans to more heavily court small-to-medium-sized and international advertisers so its core online ad business doesn't rely so heavily on large retailers, Ready said.\"Most importantly, we need to further broaden our revenue mix and accelerate the next phase of our sales and go-to-market transformation,\" he said.The disappointing results come after the company in January announced that  it would lay off less than 15% of its workforce and reduce its office space in an effort to shift resources to technical teams prioritizing the development of \"AI-powered products and capabilities.\"Pinterest then fired staffers who built a tool to quantify the layoffs, and Ready admonished them during a companywide meeting, saying that \"there's a clear line between constructive debate and behavior that's obstructionist,\" CNBC reported.The January restructuring and ongoing sales unit overhaul \"may cause some near term disruption, which we factored into our guidance to be prudent,\" Donnelly said on Thursday. Despite the results and gloomy outlook, Pinterest said that fourth-quarter global monthly active users jumped 12% year-over-year to 619 million, representing an all-time high. Wall Street was expecting that figure to be 613 million.Fourth quarter sales in the U.S. and Canada region came in at $979 million, which was ahead of StreetAccount's estimates of $973 million.WATCH: Magnificent 7 trade is broken and reversing.watch now",

    "body": "Customers shop at Walmart in Little Rock, Arkansas, Jan. 22, 2026.Will Newton | Getty ImagesInvestors got some good news this week on the state of the labor market, and more may be on the way Friday on inflation.The consumer price index, a broad measure of goods and services costs across the U.S. economy, is expected to show a 2.5% gain from a year ago, according to the Dow Jones consensus forecast for the January release. If that ends up being accurate, it would bring the widely cited inflation gauge back to its May 2025 level — a month after President Donald Trump enacted his \"liberation day\" tariffs, which many economists thought would send prices spiraling higher.The headline, or all-items, CPI was at 2.7% in December and has been on a downward trajectory since peaking just above 3% in September. Excluding food and energy, core CPI stood at 2.6% in December. Both gauges are expected to show 0.3% monthly increases in January.It's also worth noting that CPI has come in below the Wall Street consensus for the past three months. So, a light reading for January could give Federal Reserve policymakers more confidence that they can lower their benchmark borrowing rate without risking another inflation burst.Getting inflation back to 2.5% would be consistent with prices prior to the Covid pandemic and around the average of 2017-19, according to Tom Lee, head of research at Fundstrat Global Advisors.\"This is 'normal' inflation conditions even with tariff impacts still lingering in these results,\" Lee said in a note. With the fed funds rate, currently targeted between 3.5%-3.75%, well above where it was pre-Covid, \"the Fed has a lot of room to cut,\" he added.As usual, Wall Street economists will pore over the release for details. watch nowGoldman Sachs expects contribution of 0.07 percentage point to core inflation from tariffs, with upward pressure possible on clothing, recreation, household furnishings, education and personal care. However, Goldman sees headline CPI coming in a bit light at 2.4%, which could add to hopes that inflation is moderating.Markets recoiled a bit after Wednesday's strong jobs report, which showed nonfarm payroll gains of 130,000 for January and the unemployment rate dropping to 4.3%, amid speculation that a solid labor market would discourage the Fed from cutting. However, a consensus or below reading on inflation could alleviate those concerns.\"A dovish Fed is supportive of stocks, and this is why in our base case of a '3 phase market,' we see stocks exiting the year strongly,\" Lee said.The Bureau of Labor Statistics will release the report Friday at 8 a.m. ET.",

    "body": "Ring security cameras are displayed on a shelf at a Target store on June 01, 2023 in Novato, California. Justin Sullivan | Getty ImagesRing is terminating its partnership with police tech provider Flock Safety, the Amazon-owned company announced Thursday.The partnership between Flock and Ring came under scrutiny after the Amazon doorbell company ran an ad during the Super Bowl that touted a \"Search Party\" feature that uses AI to help locate lost pets. When a user initiates the feature, it activates a network of participating Ring cameras, which scan footage for images resembling the missing dog. The Electronic Frontier Foundation called the feature a \"surveillance nightmare.\"  Flock, meanwhile, operates a network of automated license plate readers, and sells access to that software to customers that include law enforcement agencies. Ring's decision to cancel its partnership with Flock comes as tech companies face growing pressure to reexamine their work with federal agencies including Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Earlier this week, Salesforce employees pressed CEO Marc Benioff to cancel \"ICE opportunities,\" CNBC reported. More than 900 Google employees also asked their company to divest itself from ICE and U.S. Customs and Border Protection.Privacy and civil liberties advocates called on Ring to drop its partnership with Flock. A protest calling on the e-commerce company to cut its ties with Flock, ICE and CBP is scheduled for Friday, outside of Amazon's Seattle headquarters. \"Following a comprehensive review, we determined the planned Flock Safety integration would require significantly more time and resources than anticipated,\" Ring wrote in a blog post. \"As a result, we have made the joint decision to cancel the planned integration.\"watch nowFlock representatives didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.Amazon acquired Ring for $839 million in 2018. The home security company is primarily known for its connected doorbell devices, which can record footage and alert users to activity around their home or business via an app.Ring has long sparked controversy about privacy due to its partnerships with police. In recent years, the company had adopted a softer image, positioning its devices as a tool to capture porch pirates and family-friendly hijinks. After founder Jamie Siminoff returned as CEO last year, the company has re-embraced its original mission of fighting crime. The Amazon company announced its partnership with Flock last October, giving owners of its video doorbells the option to share footage with law enforcement agencies that use the startup's software to assist with their \"evidence collection and investigative work.\" Flock's systems have been adopted by thousands of communities and law enforcement agencies across the country, and both ICE and CBP have reportedly accessed Flock's data as part of President Donald Trump's immigration crackdown. Flock has denied that it shares data with ICE or any \"sub-agency\" of the Department of Homeland Security. Ring spokesperson Emma Daniels said in a statement that the Flock partnership was never active, and the companies never announced a date for it to go live. \"No videos were ever shared between these services,\" Daniels said. In response to the scrutiny of its Search Party tool, Daniels said Ring built the feature \"with strong privacy protections from the start.\" Ring users can decide on a case-by-case basis whether they want to share videos with a pet owner who initiates a Search Party, she said. The news was earlier reported by The Verge. ",

Analysts were expecting $2.53 billion for the quarter, according to LSEG. The company said it expects full-year revenue growth of \"at least low double digits.\" Analysts were expecting 10.2% growth.Airbnb's revenue increased 12% during the fourth quarter from $2.48 billion during the same period last year. Airbnb has beat Wall Street's revenue expectations for 20 of the past 21 quarters, according to FactSet.The company reported net income of $341 million, or 56 cents per share, down from $461 million, or 73 cents per share, a year earlier. Airbnb attributed the lower figure to $90 million of non-income tax matters and planned investments in new growth and policy initiatives, according to a release.  Airbnb said it finished 2025 with \"strong momentum,\" and that its results reflect the strength of its core business. The company connects users who are willing to rent out their homes with travelers who are looking for places to stay. The company reported 121.9 million nights and seats booked in the fourth quarter, up 10% from a year ago and above the 117.6 million expected by StreetAccount.Gross booking value, which Airbnb uses to report host earnings, service fees, cleaning fees and taxes, totaled $20.4 billion in the fourth quarter, up 16% year over year. That figure is above the $19.4 billion expected by analysts polled by StreetAccount.Airbnb reported adjusted EBITDA — earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization — of $786 million during the period.Last month, Airbnb announced it hired Ahmad Al-Dahle, former head of generative artificial intelligence at Meta, as its new tech chief.

    "body": "watch nowHigh home prices, faltering supply and weaker consumer confidence in the economy all continue to weigh on the U.S. housing market. The chief economist for the National Association of Realtors, Lawrence Yun, is calling it \"a new housing crisis.\"Sales of previously owned homes in January dropped a much wider-than-expected 8.4% from December to a seasonally adjusted, annualized rate of 3.91 million, according to the NAR. Sales were 4.4% lower than January 2025. That is the slowest pace since December 2023 and the biggest monthly drop since February 2022.This count is based on closings, so contracts that were likely signed in November and December, when the average rate on the 30-year fixed mortgage didn't move much before dropping slightly in January. That rate is now 6.1%, according to Mortgage News Daily. Regionally, sales fell across the nation month to month but were down the most in the South and West. \"Affordability conditions are improving, with NAR's Housing Affordability Index showing that housing is the most affordable it's been since March 2022,\" Yun said in a release. \"This is due to wage gains outpacing home price growth and mortgage rates being lower than a year ago. However, supply has not kept pace and remains quite low.\"But he also noted on a call with reporters that potential buyers are \"still struggling,\" and \"renters are not participating in housing wealth.\" He characterized the current market as a crisis because, \"the movement is not happening. Americans are stuck.\"Get Property Play directly to your inboxCNBC's Property Play with Diana Olick covers new and evolving opportunities for the real estate investor, delivered weekly to your inbox.Subscribe here to get access today.Inventory came down in January from December but was still up 3.4% year over year. There were 1.22 million homes for sale at the end of January, which at the current sales pace is a 3.7-month supply. A six-month supply is considered a balanced market between buyer and seller.Tighter supply kept home prices in positive territory. The median price for a home sold in January was $396,800, up 0.9% year over year and the highest January price on record. \"Homeowners are in a financially comfortable position as a result. Since January 2020, a typical homeowner would have accumulated $130,500 in housing wealth,\" Yun added.Homes are taking longer to sell, at 46 days in January versus 41 in January 2025. About 31% of sales were to first-time buyers, up from 28% a year ago. Sales continue to be strongest on the higher end of the market; in fact, the only price segment in the positive from a year ago was the $1 million-plus range. Sales dropped the most for homes priced below $250,000.",

    "body": "watch nowThe Trump administration on Thursday revoked a landmark scientific finding that serves as the legal foundation for federal regulations to limit greenhouse gas emissions, in a devastating blow to efforts to combat climate change. The Environmental Protection Agency's endangerment finding, established under President Barack Obama in 2009, classified carbon dioxide, methane and four other greenhouse gases as a threat to public health and welfare. It underpins Clean Air Act emissions standards and rules for cars and light trucks, power plants, and oil and gas industry facilities.\"This is about as big as it gets,\"  President Donald Trump said at the White House with EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin. \"Under the process just completed by the EPA, we are officially terminating the so-called endangerment finding.\" Zeldin said all greenhouse gas emissions standards on light, medium and heavy duty vehicles that followed the endangerment finding have been eliminated. \"No longer will automakers be pressured to shift their fleets towards electric vehicles,\" he said.The endangerment finding emerged from a Supreme Court decision in 2007 that greenhouse gases are air pollutants under the Clean Air Act and the EPA must determine whether they pose a threat to public health. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Administrator Lee Zeldin speaks accompanied by U.S. President Donald Trump, at the White House in Washington, D.C., U.S., February 12, 2026. Jonathan Ernst | ReutersZeldin's decision to revoke the finding is the most significant action taken yet in the Trump administration's campaign to dismantle U.S. regulations that address climate change. He described the repeal as the largest de-regulatory action in American history. Obama said in a social media post that the Trump administration's action makes the U.S. \"less safe, less healthy and less able to fight climate change — all so the fossil fuel industry can make even more money.\"The Sierra Club, the largest environmental group in the U.S., said Trump has formalized \"climate denialism as official government policy.\" It warned that eliminating greenhouse gas standards not only imperils the public, but will expose industries to a flood of litigation. The Supreme Court ruled in a unanimous decision in 2011 that companies cannot be sued under federal common law over greenhouse emissions because regulation of these emissions had been delegated to the EPA. Trump has sought to unleash fossil fuel production in the U.S. and kill Biden administration efforts to transition to renewable energy and electric vehicles. He withdrew the U.S. from the Paris Climate Agreement and has repealed key tax subsidies for solar, wind and EVs. ",

    "body": "watch nowLast spring, Chantel Williams' position in the federal government was in limbo. Williams, once a General Services Administration employee on its hiring and recruitment team, found herself in a state of confusion and anxiety. The agency she worked for was in a holding pattern as Elon Musk's so-called Department of Government Efficiency began its work to aggressively shrink the size and scope of government agencies at President Donald Trump's direction.The DOGE cuts, a pillar of Trump's second term, were swift and wide-reaching across the federal workforce. Some of the most affected agencies included the U.S. Agency for International Development, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the Department of Health and Human Services, and the Department of Education. \"As a federal employee, the oath is to the work and to the role, and not the administration,\" Williams said. \"It started off as feeling very startling that the transition wasn't occurring as seamlessly as it had in prior years, because I had been working at GSA through a transition before.\" Williams said she felt, for the first time, real turmoil about working for the federal government. \"It was hard to wake up every day wanting to continue to serve but feel as though your leadership may have a different priority or maybe an opposition of you continuing to move forward in that mission,\" said Williams.In the end, she opted to take deferred resignation, receiving pay to leave her government post. She joined thousands of others in what was the largest reduction of the federal workforce in history, according to the U.S. Office of Personnel Management. At the end of 2025, OPM reported that approximately 352,000 employees exited roles last year, with more than 123,000 taking the deferred resignation offer. In a release late last year, OPM said it was \"in line with President Trump's goal of a smaller, more efficient government.\"Caitlin Lewis, founder and director of Work for America, started her career in local government in New York City. Lewis launched the nonprofit in November of 2024 and has helped placed former federal workers in new roles around the country in the wake of federal workforce reductions over the last year.Megan Leigh Barnard | Work for AmericaAs mass layoffs and resignations hit federal workers like Williams, Caitlin Lewis stepped in to help.Her nonprofit, Work for America, launched in November 2024 to help local governments recruit talent to fill gaps in staffing. Through its Civic Match platform, it helps former federal workers find new roles at the state and local level. The Work for America team has grown from two people to 15 in the last year, and the vast majority have come from prior careers in state, local and federal government. Four employees came directly from federal government roles.\"We never imagined the volume of need that was going to occur,\" Lewis said. \"What is so unique about this job seeker population is how unexpected the layoffs were for so many of them. Government has long been a place of stability and meaning making, and so much of what we understand the government job to be was really upended in that moment.\"Lewis, the daughter of a forest firefighter and a youth prison counselor who grew up in California, said she became civically engaged at a young age. That engagement led her to local government in New York City in the Bill de Blasio administration, first in the mayor's office and then in housing and economic development. Work for America was informed by that experience. \"In a place like New York, it really showed me how when you have the right people in the right roles in government, that the public sector really can move mountains, and when you don't, the basics start to fall apart,\" she said. \"And unfortunately we've seen that occurring in communities across the country where there hasn't been the ability to get the right talent to lean into critical roles.\"Williams quickly landed a job at Work for America after taking deferred resignation. She is now a product and data manager with the nonprofit.In the last year, Work for America has placed nearly 200 job seekers, 150 of which are former federal workers, in roles across the country. More than 12,800 job seekers have signed up for Civic Match since Trump's election, representing more than 30 federal agencies. \"For many, it's been a year of chaos and confusion. But we saw for our customers — cities and state governments across the country — that there was a true opportunity to capture the incredible talent that was going to be exiting Washington,\" Lewis said.Nate Haight turned to Civic Match as sweeping cuts took place at USAID, where he spent a decade of his career. Haight started out as an intern, then became a contractor, and by last year had been working as an education advisor and contract and grants specialist in its Latin America and Caribbean Bureau. Last February, he was told his job was under review and would most likely be cut.\"I particularly loved my work in the education sector. It was really meaningful being able to go out and see the impact that the programs were having around the world,\" Haight said. \"I was invested in the work and I saw the difference that it was making.\"He opted to take the deferred resignation offer from the government and found a new role through Work for America's platform, knowing competition would be steep locally given how many other former federal workers were looking for jobs. Today, he's in Indiana with his wife and four children, working as a grants administrator for the city of Indianapolis and Marion County.\"I think the satisfaction and fulfillment that I've been able to find already working in local government, I just want to encourage others to give it a shot as well ... and to encourage everyone to keep their head up and know that all of the skills and experiences that they've gained, they're going to be able to make a tremendous impact wherever they end up landing,\" Haight said of his fellow former federal workers.In the months to come, Civic Match is rolling out new features including candidate match scores powered by artificial intelligence, improved location targeting for jobs, city-specific pages and more. Hope Rahill, a former political appointee in the Biden administration who left her role as the Trump administration moved in, is now director of people and culture at Work for America. Rahill said while the group has had success in placing candidates, many former workers are still looking for work and coming up on a year of \"unemployment or underemployment.\"\"There are still so many people looking for work,\" Rahill said.",

    "body": "FILE PHOTO: White House counsel Kathryn Ruemmler listens as President Barack Obama speaks at an installation ceremony for FBI Director James Comey at FBI Headquarters in Washington, Monday, Oct. 28, 2013.Charles Dharapak | APTop Goldman Sachs lawyer Kathryn Ruemmler said Thursday night that she will leave the investment bank at the end of June, a decision that came after a flurry of news articles highlighting documents detailing the former White House counsel's often chummy email conversations with the notorious sex predator Jeffrey Epstein.Goldman, for months, has defended Ruemmler after Congress and then the Department of Justice released emails between her and Epstein, as well as other documents related to investigations of him. Ruemmler, who has been a key advisor to Goldman CEO David Solomon since joining the bank in 2020, told The Financial Times on Thursday, \"I made the determination that the media attention on me, relating to my prior work as a defence attorney, was becoming a distraction.\"The FT first reported the 54-year-old's decision to leave Goldman.\"Since I joined Goldman Sachs six years ago, it has been my privilege to help oversee the firm's legal, reputational, and regulatory matters; to enhance our strong risk management processes; and to ensure that we live by our core value of integrity in everything we do,\" Ruemmler said in a statement to CNBC.\"My responsibility is to put Goldman Sachs' interests first,\" Ruemmler said.\"Earlier today, I regretfully informed David Solomon of my intention to step down as Chief Legal Officer and General Counsel of Goldman Sachs as of June 30, 2026.\"Solomon, in a statement, said, \"Throughout her tenure, Kathy has been an extraordinary general counsel, and we are grateful for her contributions and sound advice on a wide range of consequential legal matters for the firm.\"\"As one of the most  accomplished professionals in her field, Kathy has also been a mentor and friend to many of our people, and she will be missed. I accepted her resignation, and I respect her decision,\" Solomon said.Her announcement that she will leave Goldman comes nearly a week after The Wall Street Journal reported that Ruemmler was one of three people whom Epstein called on July 6, 2019, after being arrested by federal authorities on child sex trafficking charges at an airport in New Jersey. The Journal's report cites a handwritten set of notes by law enforcement about comments Epstein made inside an FBI vehicle after his arrest.Those notes are among documents released in late January by the Department of Justice, CNBC has confirmed.Other news articles detailed emails and documents showing how Epstein had made gifts to Ruemmler that included a Hermes bag, and other luxury items, such as a Fendi purse, spa visits, Bergdorf Goodman gift cards and flowers. On one occasion, she effusively thanked him, calling him \"Uncle Jeffrey,\" one email showed.Ruemmler was a white-collar criminal defense lawyer at the firm Latham & Watkins during the years she was speaking with Epstein, whom she met in 2014.An Aug. 14, 2014, email contained in the DOJ's Epstein files shows how he asked her to represent his client, Bank Edmond de Rothschild.\"They have a justice department problem ... like every other swiss bank,\" Epstein wrote her.Ruemmler took the bank as a client for Latham.Ruemmler has said that she never represented Epstein, who killed himself in a New York federal jail weeks after his 2019 arrest.Read more CNBC politics coverageEpstein files: DOJ says it logs Congress members' searches to 'protect' victim informationEpstein files: AG Pam Bondi seemed to have Rep. Jayapal's DOJ database search history at hearingJudge blocks Pete Hegseth's censure of Sen. Mark Kelly over troops video, for nowWatch Pam Bondi hearing: AG touts record Dow as Democrats grill her over Trump, EpsteinRuemmler's spokeswoman, Jennifer Connelly, told the Journal for its story last Friday, \"These documents are consistent with what Ms. Ruemmler has repeatedly said: She knew Epstein when she was a criminal defense attorney and shared a client with him.\"\"She was friendly with him in that context. She had no knowledge of any ongoing criminal conduct on his part,\" Connelly said.Ruemmler previously served as White House counsel under former President Barack Obama.She is the latest person to lose a high-profile position because of her prior association with Epstein.On Sunday, Morgan Sweeney resigned as chief of staff to British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, saying he took responsibility for advising Starmer to appoint Peter Mandelson as the United Kingdom's ambassador to the United States. Starmer fired Mandelson from that post in September over disclosures about his connection to Epstein.Last week, Brad Karp, chairman of the major corporate law firm Paul Weiss, resigned from that post after fallout over emails between him and Epstein. Karp is staying at the firm.\"In response to the Epstein emails, a Paul Weiss spokesman previously said, \"Mr. Karp never witnessed or participated in any misconduct. Mr. Karp attended two group dinners in New York City and had a small number of social interactions by email, all of which he regrets.\"Karp said he was leaving the chairman's post because of the distraction of the news stories.In November, after a congressional committee released emails between Ruemmler and Epstein, Goldman Sachs spokesman Tony Fratto told CNBC, \"These emails were private correspondence well before Kathy Ruemmler joined Goldman Sachs.\"\"Kathy is an exceptional general counsel and we benefit from her judgment every day,\" Fratto said at the time.Ruemmler has previously told the Journal that she regrets ever knowing Epstein.Among the new tranche of emails that the DOJ released in late January is one that Ruemmler sent Epstein in March 2019, four months before his arrest.In that email, she offered advice on how to respond to criticism that he had previously received special treatment and a light punishment in 2008 because of his wealth and political connections when he avoided federal prosecution in exchange for pleading guilty in Florida state court to a charge of soliciting prostitution from an underage girl. At the time Epstein sought Ruemmler's advice, he had been the subject of a series of articles in the Miami Herald that were critical of the decision by federal prosecutors not to file charges against him in 2008. Epstein ended up serving just 13 months in state prison in Florida, but was allowed out to go to his office during the day for much of that time.The subject line of the email thread, \"From wapo,\" suggests that Epstein was reaching out to Ruemmler because of an inquiry by The Washington Post about him.Ruemmler wrote in the email: \"Something like: … 'The criticism is wrong and reflects a fundamental [misunderstanding] of both the facts underlying Mr. Epstein's case and how it was [prosecuted] by both local and federal authorities.\"\"Far from [receiving] a sweetheart deal, Mr. Epstein was subjected to a lengthy, aggressive, [and] highly unusual federal investigation for what were, in essence, local [offenses] of sexual solicitation,\" Ruemmler wrote. \"He accepted responsibility, served [time and] prison, and paid significant monetary settlements to the victims [involved].\"Ruemmler, in a bracketed section, also suggested saying something like, \"But for his wealth, it is hard to imagine that Mr. Epstein … would have received the aggressive treatment that he did from [federal] prosecutors, and he certainly would never have been subjected to the [salacious] and malicious treatment by the media that he continues to receive more than 10 years after the case was resolved.\"",

    "body": "Chinese smartphone company Xiaomi launched its YU7 electric SUV in summer 2025, taking direct aim at Tesla's Model Y.Sopa Images | Lightrocket | Getty ImagesBEIJING — Xiaomi's electric car venture has succeeded in dethroning Tesla in China, at least in January.The Xiaomi YU7 SUV ranked first in China by sales last month, with 37,869 units sold, twice as many as Tesla's 16,845 Model Y vehicles, according to data from the China Passenger Car Association.The Model Y, which was the best-selling model in December, plunged to 20th place in January. Among new energy vehicles, it also fell from the first position to seventh over the same period. The figures include both electric and gasoline-powered vehicles and were published late Thursday by online car sales platform Autohome.Xiaomi started selling the YU7, its second electric car model, roughly half a year ago in the summer of 2025.The Chinese company, best known for its smartphones, hasn't been shy about its aim to take on Tesla. Xiaomi launched the car at a starting price that was 10,000 yuan ($1,450) below the Model Y in China. The company claimed the model beat Tesla on key metrics such as driving range on a single battery charge.watch nowAnalysts last year predicted the YU7 would take market share from the Model Y, Tesla's best-selling car in China. In December, the Model Y ranked first in monthly sales, ahead of BYD's budget-priced Qin Plus car. Xiaomi's YU7 ranked third. Monthly sales figures can be volatile. While the YU7 did outsell the Model Y in October, the Xiaomi car did not rank first. Tesla has so far been consistently stronger in sales.Excluding gasoline-powered cars, Tesla ranked fifth in China sales last year, while Xiaomi placed tenth. For all of 2025, BYD led China's auto market with over 3 million vehicles sold, followed by Geely at 2.6 million, according to China Passenger Car Association data. \n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tWeekly analysis and insights from Asia's largest economy in your inbox\n\t\t\tSubscribe now\n\t\t\n\tThe YU7's strong sales in January came despite an overall slowdown in China's electric car market in recent months.Xiaomi's earlier SU7 sedan has also faced scrutiny following fatal accidents involving driver-assist features and electrically-powered door handles. Beijing has since banned hidden door handles, while automakers have started installing external lights that indicate when driver-assist is in use.Like most Chinese electric car companies, Xiaomi also plans to expand overseas, including into Europe next year.",

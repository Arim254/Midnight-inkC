Cuba's coast guard said on February 25, 2026, it shot dead four people and wounded six others traveling in a US-registered speedboat during an exchange of fire near Cuba's shores that came amid heightened tensions with Washington.Adalberto Roque | Afp | Getty ImagesThe Kremlin on Thursday said that the situation in fuel-starved Cuba is intensifying after a deadly incident with a U.S.-registered speedboat off the coast of the Caribbean island. \"We see that the situation around Cuba is escalating,\" Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters, according to Russian state news outlet RIA Novosti.\"The most important thing is the humanitarian component. Of course, the humanitarian issues of Cuban citizens must be resolved, and no one should create obstacles,\" Peskov said. The comments come shortly after Cuba's interior ministry said border guards killed four exiles and wounded six others onboard a Florida-tagged speedboat that entered its territorial waters. The 10 passengers of the vessel were said to have opened fire on a Cuban patrol off the northern coast of the island. The individuals, all of which were Cuban nationals residing in the U.S., were armed and some had previous criminal records, Cuba's interior ministry said. It added that assault rifles, handguns, improvised explosive devices and camouflage uniforms were among the items seized from the boat.U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio described the incident as \"highly unusual\" and said the White House would \"respond appropriately\" once it had conducted an independent investigation.

The Trump administration has effectively cut Cuba off from Venezuelan oil since launching a military operation to seize Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro on Jan. 3. Cuba said 32 of its citizens were killed in the attack.U.S. President Donald Trump has since said Cuba's government poses \"an unusual and extraordinary threat\" and pledged to impose tariffs on any country that supplies it with oil.

    "body": "Samsung Electronics unveiled its latest series of flagship smartphones on Wednesday, with two of the models costing $100 more than their predecessors as the industry tries to recover from a global shortage of memory chips.Samsung is touting improved AI and a privacy display in its new models against a backdrop of industry-wide memory chip shortages brought about by the rapid scaling of AI infrastructure.The average selling price of smartphones in 2026 was expected to rise 6.9% as a result of the memory crunch, Counterpoint Research said in a note in December.The starting price has stayed flat on the highest end model, the S26 Ultra, compared to last year's S25 series. The S26 and S26+ saw a $100 rise compared with their S25 predecessors:Galaxy S26: $899Galaxy S26+: $1,099Galaxy S26 Ultra: $1,299Ben Wood, chief analyst at CSS Insight, told CNBC the chip shortage was \"not a short-term issue.\"He added: \"We expect the global shortage of memory chips to persist well into 2027, primarily driven by the rapid expansion of AI infrastructure, which is diverting supply away from smartphones, PCs, and other consumer electronics.\"Samsung S26 Ultra.New specsThe S26 series is the third of \"AI phones\" by Samsung, following the S24 release two years ago. The company says the new models' processing chips are faster than those of previous generations. It added they use AI tools to help with things like photo editing and document scanning.Samsung's S26 series does take some \"positive steps forward\" in making AI features easier to use for consumers, said Wood. But, he added: \"I fear that consumers will still question how much value it really offers at this juncture.\"Wood added the \"stand-out feature\" on the S26 Ultra is its privacy display, which controls how pixels disperse light, limiting what those viewing from side angles can see. The company says this feature is a world first.Samsung S26 Ultra.Memory crunchMemory prices in segments such as smartphones have doubled over the past two quarters, according to CSS Insight research, said Wood.While memory manufacturers are investing in new capacity, the chip shortage is expected to last until 2027 or early 2028, he added.\"Rising memory semiconductor prices are a global issue and impacts the global broader industry,\" a Samsung spokesperson told CNBC.They added: \"Samsung expects to be relatively well-positioned on the supply side through strategic partnerships and will continue efforts to minimize the impact on its business by responding flexibly to market changes.\"Smartphone makers are looking at ways to mitigate the memory shortage risk by diversifying suppliers,  Paolo Pescatore, TMT analyst at PP Foresight, told CNBC. The memory crunch is no longer a \"niche supply-chain talking point\", he added, but a \"strategic constraint on the AI roadmap.\"\"If memory costs stay elevated, Samsung faces a familiar squeeze: protect margins or protect volumes,\" Pescatore said.",

The results come as carmakers across the globe look to walk back their EV plans. Car giants including GM, Ford and Honda, for example, have all announced billions of dollars in charges to write-down EV investments in recent months. The trend underscores the shifting dynamics at play on the road to full electrification.\"Our 2025 full year results reflect the cost of over-estimating the pace of the energy transition and of the need to reset our business around our customers' freedom to choose from the full range of electric, hybrid and internal combustion technologies,\" Stellantis CEO Antonio Filosa said in a statement. \"In 2026 our focus will be on continuing to close the execution gaps of the past, adding further momentum to our return to profitable growth,\" he added.Stellantis said it had suspended its dividend for 2026, as it had previously flagged, and issued up to 5 billion euros of hybrid bonds. It also reiterated its 2026 forecasts, including a mid-single-digit percentage increase in net revenues and a low-single-digit adjusted operating margin.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconMilan-listed shares of Stellantis so far this year.Milan-listed shares of Stellantis rose 0.4% on the news.

Stellantis said it expects positive industrial free cash flow in 2027.Over the second half of 2025, Stellantis it delivered a \"solid\" performance, noting consolidated shipments came in at 2.8 million units, with North America posting the strongest contribution. Net revenues rose 10% to 79.25 billion euros through the latter half of 2025 when compared to the same period a year ago. These results reflect the initial impact of improved operational efficiencies, disciplined commercial strategies and the strength of the firm's global brand portfolio, Stellantis said.",

    "body": "Ranking member Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., questions Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent during the Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee hearing titled \"The Financial Stability Oversight Council's Annual Report to Congress,\" in Dirksen building on Thursday, Feb. 5, 2026. Tom Williams | CQ-Roll Call, Inc. | Getty ImagesDemocratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren is calling President Donald Trump's bluff after he claimed to be \"ending\" the affordability crisis during his State of the Union address, opening a new front in the battle that could determine November's midterm elections.\"Your claims are directly at odds with the day-to-day experiences of American households, who are struggling with rising costs of essentials, including food, housing, health care, child care, and electricity,\" Warren, D-Mass., wrote in a letter to Trump, which was shared exclusively with CNBC after being sent late Wednesday. \"Despite your claims, you have not 'solved' affordability or 'defeated' inflation. Instead, over the past year, prices have skyrocketed for American households,\" Warren, the top Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee, wrote.Warren's letter is the launching point for a frontal assault on Trump and congressional Republicans ahead of the 2026 midterms, which could be decided over affordability. Trump's approval rating on the economy has plummeted as voters express concern about the high cost of living, a contrast with an economy he said was \"roaring\" during his State of the Union address. Now, Democrats are hoping to seize the opportunity to leverage affordability and kick Republicans out of power in Congress. Warren made clear the letter is only her first foray into knocking the president on affordability, as Democrats race around the country selling their economic message before November. Read more CNBC politics coverageState of the Union 2026 recap: Trump touted economic gainsEpstein files: Trump sexual abuse claims withheld by DOJSenators tell CFTC prediction market contracts need clear guidanceDemocrats seek to force refunds after Supreme Court blocks Trump tariffsTrump demands Netflix fire Susan Rice as DOJ probes Warner deal\"Over the coming weeks, I will be writing to Administration officials, companies, and industry representatives directly about your chaotic tariffs and failed economic policies — seeking answers for the American people who are being forced to pay more on everything from groceries to housing,\" Warren said.Warren late Wednesday also sent a letter to Amazon CEO Andy Jassy saying the online retailer was tardy in publicly saying that Trump's tariffs had contributed to price increases on its platform since their enactment. She also asked Amazon to respond to a series of questions about its future plans on price hikes given Trump's pledge to find ways tariffs in place. Trump has at times suggested he is getting serious about addressing affordability concerns. He's called for a cap on interest on credit cards, which he did not mention in his speech. He's also called for a ban on institutional investors from buying homes, which he did mention. Both are also priorities of Warren's and the progressive left.But in his State of the Union address, Trump laid blame solely on Democrats for affordability and argued his administration has solved the problem, as polls consistently show increased economic concern from voters. \"You caused that problem,\" the president said. \"They knew their statements were a dirty, rotten lie. Their policies created the high prices, our policies are rapidly ending them.\"US President Donald Trump gestures as he delivers the State of the Union address in the House Chamber of the US Capitol in Washington, DC, on February 24, 2026. Andrew Caballero-Reynolds | Afp | Getty ImagesWhile overall inflation has cooled significantly from recent highs, the cost of many everyday goods remains high, especially compared to before the Covid-19 pandemic. Electricity prices have skyrocketed amid increased demand from data centers, grocery prices remain high and housing costs have remained inflated. Trump's tariff agenda has also contributed to lingering high prices. Trump doubled down on issuing tariffs through other means during his address, after the Supreme Court knocked down the authority he had been using to implement them. The tariffs will \"remain in place under fully approved and tested alternative legal statutes,\" he said. To Warren, that only provided ammunition. \"Rather than providing relief to consumers, you are pursuing additional across-the-board tariffs through other mechanisms — opening the door to yet another wave of price hike,\" she said in her letter. ",

Guests include labor union leaders, representatives from the Black Economic Alliance and the National Low Income Housing Coalition, and Virginia Gov. Abigail Spanberger, a former member of the House who delivered the Democratic rebuttal to Trump's Tuesday night State of the Union.Democrats will use the time together away from the Capitol to hone their messages to voters and to coalesce around what they think are the themes that will resonate with ordinary Americans.\"Is the president working for you?\" Spanberger asked in her speech, which made the case that Trump's policies were hurting average Americans.\"This is the defining contrast of the midterms. While Republicans broke their promise to lower costs, Democrats are focused on lowering costs for hardworking families just trying to get by,\" said Rep. Suzan DelBene, D-Wash., chair of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and the person responsible for leading her party to taking control of the House.But victory is far from assured. Trump and Republicans are making their own aggressive pitch on affordability. They also have a cash advantage this cycle. And they have rolled out a series of election proposals — like voter-identification requirements and changes to mail voting — that Democrats say could disenfranchise millions. Coupled with the Supreme Court's pending decision on a challenge to a section of the Voting Rights Act that, if upheld, could eliminate some Democratic-held districts, Republicans are not out of contention come November.Still, there is cause for Democratic optimism. Recent polling shows many Americans are souring on Trump — a Washington Post-ABC News-Ipsos poll found 60% disapprove of the president. And Democrats have maintained a healthy lead in the generic ballot. Also, they need to net just three seats to flip the House.\"President Trump wants to take over elections. He's going to continue to tweet out and put out executive orders. He and republican governors could do other untoward things to affect our elections,\" House Democratic Caucus Chair Pete Aguilar, D-Calif., said. \"What we can control is communicating a message that will resonate to people. And that's what we're focused on,\" Aguilar said. ",

His resignation came as the university was conducting a review of emails and other documents detailing Summers' connection to Epstein, which were released in recent months by the Department of Justice and Congress.\"I have made the difficult decision to retire from my Harvard professorship at the end of this academic year,\" Summers said in a statement obtained by CNBC. \"I will always be grateful to the thousands of students and colleagues I have been privileged to teach and work with since coming to Harvard as a graduate student 50 years ago.\"\"Free of formal responsibility, as President Emeritus and a retired professor, I look forward in time to engaging in research, analysis, and commentary on a range of global economic issues,\" he said.Summers, who went on leave from Harvard in November because of fallout from those emails, has not been accused of wrongdoing in connection with Epstein. He will not teach or take on new advisees until his retirement is effective.\"In connection with the ongoing review by the University of documents related to Jeffrey Epstein that were recently released by the government, Harvard Kennedy School Dean Jeremy Weinstein has accepted Professor Lawrence H. Summers' resignation from his leadership position as co-director of the Mossavar-Rahmani Center for Business and Government,\" Harvard spokesman Jason Newton told CNBC in a statement Wednesday. \"Professor Summers has announced that he will retire from his academic and faculty appointments at Harvard at the end of this academic year and will remain on leave until that time,\" Newton said.Read more CNBC politics coverageState of the Union 2026 recap: Trump touted economic gainsEpstein files: Trump sexual abuse claims withheld by DOJSenators tell CFTC prediction market contracts need clear guidanceDemocrats seek to force refunds after Supreme Court blocks Trump tariffsTrump demands Netflix fire Susan Rice as DOJ probes Warner dealIn November, when he went on leave from Harvard and resigned from the board of the artificial intelligence company OpenAI, Summers said: \"I am deeply ashamed of my actions and recognize the pain they have caused. I take full responsibility for my misguided decision to continue communicating with Mr. Epstein.\"His statement then came after reports by the Harvard student newspaper, The Crimson, which detailed how Summers had sought guidance from Epstein while pursuing a romantic relationship with a woman.On Tuesday, the Nobel Prize-winning scientist Richard Axel said he would step down as co-director of Columbia University's Zuckerman Mind Brain Behavior Institute in light of his own communications with Epstein drawing attention.A third Ivy League school, Yale University, on Feb. 11 said it had barred professor David Gelernter from teaching computer science classes pending a review of his contacts with Epstein, which included mentioning a Yale student for a potential project.Other high-profile people recently have suffered professional and legal fallout from their connections to Epstein being detailed in the DOJ's documents database.Epstein killed himself in a New York City federal jail in 2019, weeks after his arrest on child sex trafficking charges.",

    "body": "Rolls-Royce said Thursday it expects profits of over £4 billion ($5.42 billion) this year as the aero engine and power systems maker promised another year of robust growth.The aerospace giant is targeting underlying operating profit of between £4 billion and £4.2 billion in 2026, above the midpoint of £3.65 billion as expected by analysts polled by FactSet. It expects free cash flow of between £3.6 billion and £3.8 billion this year, also above expectations. It also announced that £2.5 billion of share buybacks would be completed this year as part of a multi-year buyback program of between £7 billion and £9 billion ($12 billion) for 2026 to 2028, above what earlier media reports had suggested. Shares rose as much as 7% in early trading on Thursday. The stock last traded up 4.5% and was on track for a record high after already reaching new highs multiple times this year.Based on the bullish outlook, the company now expects to deliver profits within the prior mid-term guidance range two years earlier than planned, CEO Tufan Erginbilgic said. \"Our transformation continues with pace and intensity,\" he said in a statement. The British company upgraded its 2028 targets to £4.9 billion to £5.2 billion in underlying operating profit, an operating margin in the range of 18% to 20%, and free cash flow of £5 billion to £5.3 billion. Beyond the mid-term, Erginbilgic said he expected his company to benefit from AI, the energy transition, and increased defense spending.Rolls-Royce shares have been on a tear over the past few years amid growth in all three of its businesses: civil aerospace, defense, and power systems. Over the past 12 months, the stock has more than doubled as the company has thrived amid a transformation plan launched by Erginbilgic, which has boosted investor confidence. The plan includes cutting costs and prioritizing its core businesses. Stock Chart IconStock chart iconRolls-Royce shares are up more than 100% over the past year.In 2025, underlying operating profits jumped over 40% to a record £3.46 billion, beating FactSet estimates of £3.32 billion. Underlying revenue in the year rose 12% to £20.1 billion.It was the company's fourth straight year of beating earnings expectations.The beat-and-raise quarterly report was described as a \"high quality release\" by Jefferies analyst Chloe Lemarie, who noted that profits were driven by the power systems business. The unit, which is benefitting from the mass build-out of data centers that rely on Rolls-Royce's power generation system, generated £4.89 billion in revenue in 2025, reflecting an organic growth of 19% year-on-year.Read moreIts civil aerospace business — its biggest revenue and profit driver — which sells engines to Boeing and Airbus among others, grew 15% compared to last year. Its defense unit grew 8%.Rolls-Royce is one of four leading aero engine manufacturers globally, alongside RTX subsidiary Pratt & Whitney, CFM International, and GE Aerospace.CEO Erginbilgic highlighted on Thursday the possibility of the company returning to supplying narrow-body aircraft with engines. Rolls-Royce currently makes engines for wide-body planes such as Boeing's Boeing 787 Dreamliner and Airbus' A330 neo jets.It comes amid an engine squeeze for aircraft makers who are struggling to secure enough engines to meet delivery targets.\"We have an unsatisfactory situation with less engines than what we would need,\" Airbus CEO Guillaume Faury told CNBC last week, referring to a clash with its key engine supplier Pratt & Whitney about 2026 engine deliveries.",

    "body": "watch nowThe major technology companies will meet President Donald Trump at the White House next week to sign a pledge that they will supply their own power for artificial intelligence data centers. Amazon, Google, Meta, Microsoft, xAI, Oracle and OpenAI will sign the agreement at the March 4 meeting, a White House official confirmed to CNBC Wednesday.\"Under this bold initiative, these massive companies will build, bring, or buy their own power supply for new AI data centers, ensuring that Americans' electricity bills will not increase as demand grows,\" White House spokeswoman Taylor Rogers told CNBC. Fox News first reported the development. Trump said during his State of the Union address Tuesday that he had secured such a pledge from the tech sector, but did not provide detail on what the agreement entails. \"We're telling the major tech companies that they have the obligation to provide for their own power needs,\" the president said. \"They can build their own power plants as part of their factory so that no one's prices will go up.\"Data centers are facing opposition in communities across the U.S. as people blame rising utility bills on the facilities' huge electricity consumption.The Trump administration has closely embraced the AI industry as an engine of economic growth and a pillar of U.S. national security. It is an alliance that poses political risks for the White House ahead of the midterm elections. New Jersey Gov. Mikie Sherrill and Virginia Gov. Abigail Spanberger defeated their Republican opponents in landslide elections last November by campaigning against rising electricity prices.The Trump administration has warned the tech companies that they risk a backlash if the public believes their data centers are driving up energy costs, Energy Secretary Chris Wright said Wednesday. \"We want to see data centers developed,\" Wright told reporters on a call. \"We want to see them rapidly sited. We want to see communities welcoming them, but to do that, it's necessary to have up-front investments in the additional grid infrastructure needed.\" ",

Discovery as Paramount ratchets up its rival bid, Politico reported Wednesday.The reported visit is set to occur five days after President Donald Trump demanded that Netflix immediately fire former Obama administration official Susan Rice from its board, or else \"pay the consequences.\"It was not immediately clear if Sarandos would be meeting with Trump during the visit, a person familiar with the discussions told Politico.Netflix declined CNBC's request for comment on the report. The White House, asked by CNBC to confirm the visit, said, \"We do not discuss private meetings that may or may not be happening.\"The acquisition fight over WBD, like numerous other business deals in over the past year, has been entangled with presidential politics.Trump had weeks earlier said he would stay out of the multibillion-dollar bidding war between Netflix, which wants to buy WBD's studio and streaming brands, and Paramount, which seeks to acquire WBD's whole business.But Trump appeared to change course when, in a Truth Social post on Saturday afternoon, he demanded that Netflix fire Rice from its board, calling her \"racist\" and a \"political hack.\"Trump on Truth Social linked to an X post from Laura Loomer, a far-right media figure in Trump's orbit, slamming Rice and urging the president to \"kill the Netflix-Warner Bros. merger now.\"Loomer's post highlighted a recent podcast appearance in which Rice, who has served in the Obama, Clinton and Biden administrations, predicted that corporations and other institutions that appeased Trump will be held \"accountable\" when his political opposition regains power.Read more CNBC politics coverageState of the Union 2026 recap: Trump touted economic gainsEpstein files: Trump sexual abuse claims withheld by DOJSenators tell CFTC prediction market contracts need clear guidanceDemocrats seek to force refunds after Supreme Court blocks Trump tariffsTrump demands Netflix fire Susan Rice as DOJ probes Warner dealThe WBD deal proposals have raised antitrust concerns.

The Commerce Department issued a letter of intent last month to provide USA Rare Earth with $1.6 billion in funding to help scale up the company's planned rare earth mining and magnet manufacturing business. The deal required USA Rare Earth to secure at least $500 million in private funding. USA Rare Earth selected Cantor as as the \"lead placement agent\" for a fundraising round that totaled $1.5 billion, according to a financial filing.   Lutnick stepped down last year as CEO and chairman of Cantor to lead Commerce. His son Brandon took the reins as chairman and his son Kyle was named executive vice chairman. Lutnick transferred his stake in Cantor to his sons and other adult children through trusts controlled by Brandon. \"We have serious concerns about the Commerce Department's decision to enter this deal in which your former firm, run by your sons, has a clear financial interest,\" the senators said. \"Given your close ties to Cantor, and Cantor's apparent financial interest in USAR, the Commerce Department's investment should be closely scrutinized,\" they said. CNBC has reached out to the Commerce Department for comment. watch nowThe Cantor-led fundraising round was a type of transaction called private investment in public equity, or PIPE. In these transactions, a placement agent usually sells discounted shares to a restricted pool of investors while receiving a fee, the senators wrote. \"If the PIPE funds were raised under these circumstances, then it appears that, in order to secure public funds from the government agency you lead, USAR paid your family's company to raise matching private funds,\" the senators said. The senators also raised concerns that financial firms led by donors to President Donald Trump's campaigns and inaugural committees participated in the fundraising for USA Rare Earth. They include Blackstone CEO and co-founder Stephen Schwarzman, Citadel founder Ken Griffin, and Point72 Asset Management founder Steven Cohen, according to a financial filing. Schwarzman donated to Trump's super PAC, Griffin gave funds to the president's 2025 inaugural committee, and Cohen donated to his first term inauguration.\"It is unclear how or why these supporters of the Trump administration became involved in the USAR PIPE, or the extent to which they were aware of the Commerce Department's direct investment in USAR,\" the senators said. Griffin has made donations to multiple presidents across administrations, Citadel spokesperson Zia Ahmed said. \"The USA Rare Earth investment was made by a Citadel-managed fund, not by Ken Griffin personally,\" Ahmed said. CNBC has reached out to Blackstone and Point72 for comment.The letter requests information on when Lutnick became aware of Cantor's representation of USA Rare Earth in the fundraising round and whether he or Commerce had any involvement in it, among other questions.

    "body": "IntrinsicGoogle is folding in former moon shot robotics software company Intrinsic as Alphabet tries to streamline its ambitions in the space.After five and a half years developing its technology at Alphabet's \"moonshot factory\" X, Intrinsic became an independent Alphabet company in its \"Other Bets\" division in July 2021. The Google parent company announced Wednesday that it will be folded into Google itself.While hardware like robotic arms has become cheaper, programming them remains incredibly complex, often requiring hundreds of hours of manual coding by specialized engineers that can vary based on the particular robot. Intrinsic's flagship product, Flowstate, is a web-based platform that allows users to build robotic applications without having to write thousands of lines of code. \"Joining Google allows us to amplify our collective work across frontier AI spanning R&D through to deployment and daily operations enabling industrial use cases in manufacturing and logistics,\" the company said in its announcement.

It also shows the company is ready to scale its products while working more closely with Google's AI teams.In November, Intrinsic and Nvidia supplier Foxconn announced a partnership to deploy AI robots for electronics assembly in Foxconn's U.S. factories.Intrinsic CEO Wendy Tan White said in Wednesday's announcement that by using Google's AI and infrastructure, it can \"unlock the promise of physical AI for a much broader set of manufacturing businesses and developers.\"watch now",

    "body": "Liubomyr Vorona | Istock | Getty ImagesThe prospect of being replaced by artificial intelligence is helping to scare higher-income workers and leading them to stay in their jobs longer, according to several recent surveys.One closely followed gauge, the University of Michigan Survey of Consumers, show confidence in the labor market among high earners around its historic lows going back to the late-1970s. Likewise, the New York Federal Reserve's monthly consumer survey shows unemployment angst also around record highs.Finally, payrolls processing firm ADP notes that turnover among traditionally white-collar occupations is around record lows.The reason for the trend? \"Our guess is partially 'AI fear', as white collar jobs are possibly at greater risk, but we are open to other explanations,\" UBS chief economist Arend Kapteyn said in a note. The rise of AI is causing both excitement and fear among investors, employers and workers alike. Policymakers also are trying to gauge the impact of the new technology and how it will fit into the economy.\"In my lifetime, I have never seen a technological revolution like this — and I have seen the birth of space exploration, the rise of the personal computer, the explosion of the internet and then smartphones,\" Fed Governor Christopher Waller said Tuesday. \"Firms, households, and every government [agency] are all trying to incorporate it into the way they function and operate.\"watch nowFor the moment, AI appears to be contributing to angst and caution.Over the past year, the University of Michigan survey has found a general decline in sentiment over the labor market. However, it's been most pronounced among the top one-third of earners, whose sentiment score on the labor market, in this case expectations for a higher unemployment rate, to be at its lowest level since the financial crisis ended in 2009. Sentiment among lower-income workers also has declined but is actually higher than those at the top end.Likewise, the New York Fed's month Survey of Consumer Expectations is showing that expectations of finding a job in three months if one loses their job today is around the lowest for a data sent that stretches to mid-2013.And ADP's extensive data on the private jobs picture shows that professions such as finance and information and business services is showing reduced turnover rate. In January, turnover for professional and business services was the lowest the firm ever recorded.\"The normal push-and-pull of job gains and pay growth — quantity and price — that once kept the labor market dynamic has weakened, giving way to a market defined more by inactivity than vigor,\" said Nela Richardson, chief economist at ADP.To be sure, the jobs picture is still very strong for higher-income groups.While the Bureau of Labor Statistics does not break out the unemployment rate by income, it does classify it by profession. Finance, for instance, had a jobless level of just 2.1% in January, close to the same level a year ago. Professional and business services was somewhat elevated at 4.5%, but down 0.4 percentage point from January 2025.\"We immediately jump to the notion that a bunch ⁠of people are going to ‌be displaced\" by AI, Richmond Fed President Thomas Barkin ‌said at an event Wednesday. \"We should also remember ⁠people are going ⁠to be enabled.\"Similarly, Kansas City Fed President Jeffrey Schmid said in the long run, AI will be a benefit to the labor market and the economy.\"I personally think we're going to need AI to supplement the fact that we aren't having new entrants into the labor market like we did, let's say 30 years ago or 40 years ago,\" Schmid said during a separate event Wednesday. \"So AI is going to have to be an enhancement to do jobs.\"",

    "body": "OpenAI CEO Sam Altman attends an event to pitch AI for businesses in Tokyo, Feb. 3, 2025.Kim Kyung-hoon | ReutersJoshua Kushner's Thrive Capital invested roughly $1 billion in OpenAI at a $285 billion valuation in December, a source confirmed Wednesday.It is a preferential deal for the venture capital firm that has long been one of the artificial intelligence startup's major financial backers. OpenAI is finalizing a massive funding round that could total more than $100 billion and boost the company's valuation to $800 billion. Thrive's investment late last year was a separate deal, but the firm is likely to participate in the current round, according to the source, who is familiar with the discussions and asked not to be named because the talks are confidential.A representative for Thrive declined to comment. The Wall Street Journal was first to report Thrive's investment.

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, who has a close relationship with Kushner, lauded the news in a post on X. \"Extremely grateful to work with Josh,\" Altman wrote. \"No one could ask for a more committed, more thoughtful, or harder-working investor.\"Kushner has deep connections with the White House as his father, Charles Kushner, is the U.S. ambassador to France, and his brother, Jared Kushner, is President Donald Trump's son-in-law.In December, OpenAI also took an ownership stake in Thrive Holdings, a company that buys, owns and runs companies that it believes could benefit from technologies like artificial intelligence. The startup did not disclose the financial terms of that agreement. OpenAI's latest funding round is expected to close in phases, as CNBC previously reported. Investments from strategics like Nvidia, SoftBank and Amazon, which make up roughly 90% of the round, will come first. Contributions from a broader pool of investors will follow.

    "body": "Wegovy injection pens arranged in Waterbury, Vermont, US, on Monday, April 28, 2025. Shelby Knowles | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesPresident Donald Trump on Thursday struck landmark deals with Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk to slash the prices of their blockbuster weight loss drugs. Under the agreements, the monthly out-of-pocket cost of popular injections and upcoming pills could range from $50 to $350 starting next year, depending on the dosage and insurance coverage a patient has, Trump administration officials said. Existing GLP-1s, including Eli Lilly's obesity injection Zepbound and Novo Nordisk's competitor Wegovy, carry list prices above $1,000 a month, which has prevented many patients from taking them. Both companies have introduced lower cost options for people paying in cash and purchasing the drugs directly through their websites.But the deals with Trump, as part of his \"most favored nation\" policy, take those efforts to expand access even further. Here's how much weight loss drugs could cost for patients under the new agreements, based on the details shared so far.Medicare Medicare has covered GLP-1 drugs for diabetes and some other medical conditions: for example, Wegovy for slashing cardiovascular risks. But under the new deals, Medicare will start covering the drugs for obesity for the first time starting in mid-2026, which could allow more seniors to qualify for them and spur more private insurers to cover them.Certain Medicare patients will pay a copay of $50 per month for all approved uses of GLP-1 drugs, including diabetes and obesity treatment. But the Trump administration is putting some constraints on which Medicare beneficiaries will be eligible to receive GLP-1s for obesity and cardiovascular and metabolic benefits. Patients are eligible if they fall into these three cohorts:The first includes those who are overweight — with a body mass index greater than 27 — or with prediabetes or established cardiovascular disease.The second group is people with obesity – with a BMI greater than 30 – and uncontrolled hypertension, kidney disease or heart failure.The third group is patients with severe obesity, or anyone with a BMI greater than 35.Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk voluntarily agreed to reduce the prices the government pays for existing GLP-1 drugs already approved for diabetes and other uses to $245 a month, across all non-starting doses. Savings generated by those price reductions will allow Medicare to start paying that same price point for GLP-1s for patients with obesity and a high metabolic or cardiovascular risk. Direct-to-consumerThe agreement will also allow patients to get GLP-1s on direct-to-consumer platforms at steeper discounts than they already receive through drugmakers' existing sites.On TrumpRx – the government's direct-to-consumer platform for buying prescription drugs with cash expected to launch next year – the average monthly cost for Wegovy, Zepbound and other injectable GLP-1s will start at $350 and drop to $250 within the next two years, according to senior administration officials.Starting doses of upcoming obesity pills from Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk, pending approvals, will be $145 per month on TrumpRx, Medicare and Medicaid. Under the deals announced Thursday, the drugmakers will get fast-track reviews of their forthcoming pills. Eli Lilly on Thursday said it would lower prices by $50 on its own direct-to-consumer platform, LillyDirect, which already offers Zepbound and other drugs at a discount to cash-paying patients. The multidose pen of Zepbound will be available for $299 per month at the lowest dose, with additional doses being priced up to $449 per month. Eli Lilly's pill, once approved, will be available at the lowest dose starting at $149 per monthMedicaidState Medicaid coverage of GLP-1 drugs for obesity is spotty. But Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly agreed to extend lower government pricing for their GLP-1 drugs – $245 per month across all other non-starting doses – to all 50 Medicaid programs for all covered uses. States will have to opt into those prices, meaning some may not. Check with your state government about coverage.",

    "body": "Shoppers carry bags at Broadway Plaza in Walnut Creek, California, US, on Monday, Dec. 16, 2024. The Bureau of Economic Analysis is scheduled to release personal spending figures on December 20. David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesHoliday hiring by retailers is expected to total between 265,000 and 365,000 roles this year, the lowest number of seasonal workers in at least 15 years, the National Retail Federation said Thursday.NRF CEO Matthew Shay said on the retail trade group's conference call on that those hiring expectations \"reflect the softening and slowing labor market.\" It's a significant drop from a year ago, when retailers hired 442,000 seasonal workers, the retail trade group said.Some companies may have hired seasonal workers early to support sales events in October, but retailers have largely tried to limit their spending as they manage higher costs from tariffs, NRF chief economist Mark Mathews said.The major industry group's prediction offers the latest glimpse into the jobs market as the record government shutdown stretches on and leads to fewer government reports on economic data, such as unemployment and inflation. That's caused companies and economists to rely on data from private companies or organizations instead.Earlier Thursday, outplacement firm Challenger, Gray and Christmas said layoff announcements soared in October to 153,074, a 183% jump from September and 175% surge from the same month a year ago. That marked the highest level for any October since 2003, and 2025 has been the worst year for announced layoffs since 2009.On the other hand, payrolls processing firm ADP reported net job growth in October of 42,000, reversing two consecutive months of losses in the private sector.Higher spending, lower hiringEven with the lower levels of seasonal staffing, the NRF is optimistic holiday spending will be strong. It said it expects holiday spending to hit a record of between $1.1 trillion to $1.2 trillion from Nov. 1 through Dec. 31, the first time the total would top $1 trillion.That would represent 3.7% to 4.2% year-over-year growth from the previous holiday season, a slight decrease from last year's 4.3% holiday sales growth rate. NRF's forecast excludes auto dealers, gas stations and restaurants.Even with low consumer sentiment, a prolonged government shutdown, \"on-again-off-again tariffs\" and price sensitivity because of inflation, Shay said consumers have defied expectations and kept spending.\"In fairness, that's been somewhat of a surprise based on where we thought we might be way back in April,\" he said.He said the trade group anticipates that dynamic will persist during the key holiday shopping season. Households typically cut back during other parts of the year or on other parts of the budget to make it a festive time, he said.Even as consumers continue to spend, the retail industry has taken a cautious stance on hiring — a fact reflected in NRF's predictions for seasonal workers. It is the fourth slowest year for retail hiring on a year-to-date basis since at least 2000, behind only 2009, 2010 and 2012, several of the years following the Great Recession.Mathews told CNBC in an interview that the slow hiring environment all comes down to one word: uncertainty.\"The one thing you know businesses do when they are in uncertain environments is they put things on hold,\" he told CNBC in an interview.On NRF's conference call on Thursday, Mathews said the U.S. economy doesn't need the same level of job creation as it used to because of demographic and policy shifts, including the retirement of Baby Boomers and President Donald Trump's crackdown on immigration.Still, he said, the level of hiring and investment by companies will be an important indicator to watch in the coming year.Right now, he said, a flood of investment in artificial intelligence has been \"a huge boon for the economy.\" But he added \"that may be covering up a few cracks.\"\"We need to keep a close eye on on how businesses are feeling and what remains an uncertain environment,\" he said.",

    "body": "Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program (SNAP) signage at a grocery store in Dorchester, Massachusetts, US, on Monday, Nov. 3, 2025. Mel Musto | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesA federal judge on Thursday ordered the Trump administration to pay full SNAP benefits for November by Friday, rejecting the administration's plan to partially fund the food stamp program for 42 million Americans during the U.S. government shutdown.\"People have gone without for too long,\" Judge Jack McConnell said during a hearing in U.S. District Court in Rhode Island, where he issued the order.McConnell said the Trump administration, which had already agreed to tap a congressionally authorized contingency fund to pay partial SNAP benefits, must also use so-called Section 32 funds that it had refused to tap earlier this week.\"The evidence shows that people will go hungry, food pantries will be overburdened, and needless suffering will occur\" if SNAP is not fully funded, said McConnell.He noted in a written order that more than half of the program's recipients are children, seniors and veterans.\"While the President of the United States professes a commitment to helping those it serves, the government's actions tell a different story,\" McConnell wrote.\"Faced with a choice between advancing relief and entrenching delay, it chose the latter — an outcome that predictably magnifies harm and undermines the very purpose of the program it administers.\"The order came after plaintiffs in the case urged him to reject the plan to pay only partial benefits, which the administration disclosed in a court filing in Providence on Monday.The Trump administration later Thursday asked the 1st Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals to overturn the judge's new order, as well as an order he issued Friday directing the administration to make partial benefit payments as soon as possible.McConnell at the hearing pointed to a Truth Social post by President Donald Trump, who on Tuesday said that SNAP benefits \"will be given only when the Radical Left Democrats open up government, which they can easily do, and not before!\"Trump's post seemed to contradict statements by administration lawyers that the benefits would be partially paid for the month.The White House later said there was no change in that plan, but also said it would take time to issue the partial benefits to recipients.McConnell said that Trump's post was effectively an admission that the administration intended to defy his prior order to seek out all possible funding sources so that full benefits could be paid.The Trump administration last week said it would not use the contingency fund containing $4.65 billion to fund the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program in November. The total cost of full SNAP benefits for the month is around $8 billion.The program, like other federal programs, has no currently appropriated money, as a result of Congress failing to pass a spending bill. That failure led to the U.S. government shutting down on Oct. 1.Past presidential administrations have continued paying SNAP benefits during prior shutdowns.A group of cities, charitable and faith-based non-profit groups, unions, and business organizations sued the administration, seeking to force it to use the contingency funds and potentially other money to fund SNAP.Read more CNBC government shutdown coverage Government shutdown could cost U.S. economy up to $14 billion, CBO saysJudge extends ban on Trump firing federal workers during government shutdownStates sue Trump admin to keep SNAP benefits during government shutdownLargest federal worker union urges end to government shutdownTrump's $130 million mystery military donor is Timothy Mellon: NYTGovernment shutdown becomes second-longest in U.S. historyStates sue Trump administration to keep SNAP benefits Government shutdown becomes 2nd longest in U.S. historyHow to get student loan help during the government shutdownWhite House economic advisor Hassett says shutdown could end this weekArmy Corps of Engineers pausing $11 billion in projects over shutdown: VoughtGovernment shutdown: Trump distrust keeps Democrats from forming 'gang'Bill to fund military during government shutdown fails in Senate procedural voteMcConnell, during a court hearing last Friday, blocked the administration from halting SNAP benefits and ordered that it pay benefits from the contingency fund \"as soon as possible,\" and investigate whether other funds could be tapped to fully fund the program for the month.On Monday, the administration told McConnell it would pay 50% of the benefits by using the contingency fund. But it ruled out using at least $4 billion from the Child Nutrition Program, as well as other sources.On Wednesday night, the administration updated its plan, saying that 65% of the benefits would be paid.McConnell at Thursday's hearing blasted the U.S. Department of Agriculture for refusing to use the Nutrition Program's funds to help fully pay November's benefits, calling that decision \"arbitrary and capricious.\"\"USDA had an obligation, beginning ... Oct. 1, when the shutdown began, to prepare to use the contingency funds so that the recipients would get their benefits as expected on Nov. 1,\" McConnell said.\"USDA did not do so,\" he said. \"Even when Nov. 1 came, USDA refused to use the congressionally mandated contingency funds, USDA cannot now cry that it cannot get timely payments to beneficiaries for weeks or months because states are not prepared to make partial payments.\"Earlier Thursday, a coalition of around two dozen states asked another federal judge, in Boston, to order the administration to fully fund SNAP benefits. McConnell's order came before that judge had time to rule on that request.New York Attorney General Letitia James, whose state is one of the plaintiffs in the Boston suit, in a statement said, \"A judge in Rhode Island just stopped the federal government from starving millions of Americans.\"\"I am relieved that people will get the food they need, but it is outrageous that it took a lawsuit to make the federal government feed its own people,\" James said.",

    "body": "A Peloton stationary bicycle inside a store in Palo Alto, California, US, on Monday, Aug. 5, 2024. David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesPeloton on Thursday posted its second profitable quarter in a row as it released strong guidance for the crucial holiday shopping season, banking on its relaunched product assortment to drive growth. The connected fitness company posted a surprise net income of $13.9 million in the three months ended Sept. 30, compared with a loss of $900,000 a year earlier. For the current quarter, Peloton's strongest for hardware sales, the company is expecting revenue to be between $665 million and $685 million, a slight increase from the year-ago period and largely better than Wall Street expectations of $665 million, according to LSEG. Peloton also raised its full-year adjusted EBITDA outlook and is now expecting it to be between $425 million and $475 million, up $25 million from its previous outlook on both ends. Much of that forecast is ahead of analyst expectations of between $400 million and $450 million, according to StreetAccount. Shares jumped about 11% in extended trading Thursday.Despite the good news, Peloton is still dealing with issues from its past. Earlier on Thursday, it said it was initiating yet another recall from its early product lineup. The Consumer Product Safety Commission said the company was recalling 833,000 of its original Bike+ devices after receiving reports that the seat post can break and detach during a ride – the same issue that prompted a recall of its base Bike model in 2023. \"We have received a small number of reports of an original series Bike+ seat post breaking during use. As of today, we are aware of three such incidents,\" Peloton CEO Peter Stern said on the company's earnings call Thursday.Peloton's latest recall cost the company $13.5 million during the quarter reported Thursday, contributing to a 0.3 percentage point decline in its gross margin.For its first fiscal 2026 quarter reported Thursday, Peloton beat analyst expectations on the top and bottom lines. Here's how the fitness company did in its first fiscal quarter compared with what Wall Street was anticipating, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:Earnings per share: 3 cents vs. 0 cents expectedRevenue: $551 million vs. $540 million expectedSales dropped to $551 million, down about 6% from $586 million a year earlier. Under the direction of Stern, who took the helm in January, the connected fitness company has been finalizing its cost cuts and turning its attention back to growth now that it's back to regularly generating free cash flow and operating profitably. \"Our intent is to go well beyond [cardio connected fitness]... we've got strength, we've got mental, mental wellbeing, nutrition and hydration and sleep and recovery,\" Stern said. \"We are focused on growth, but the growth needs to be profitable … both in top line growth as well as increased margins associated with that business as well.\"Last month, Peloton relaunched its product assortment, introduced a commercial equipment line and raised prices for both subscriptions and hardware ahead of the holiday shopping season. The revamped assortment, touching its bike, rowing machine and treadmill products, features an AI-powered tracking camera, speakers, a 360-degree swivel screen and hands-free control, among other new features. \"Our launch of an entirely new product lineup with the cross training series, is a great reason for us to talk to our members and nonmembers alike,\" Stern said.Peloton is betting consumers will be willing to spend big on the products for flashy holiday gifts, either for themselves or a loved one. But just over a month into the launch, it remains unclear how they're performing. The company's first fiscal quarter ended the day before the new products were launched. Across the retail industry, the personal electronics category has been under pressure. While Peloton operates in a category of its own, shoppers have been pulling back on other big-ticket items and being more careful about where their dollars are going in an unsteady economic environment. After Peloton's last recall, the company said at the time that it saw higher-than-expected membership churn and costs as a result.– CNBC's Luke Fountain contributed to this report",

    "body": "The Omada Health logo is displayed on a smartphone screen.Sopa Images | Lightrocket | Getty ImagesVirtual care company Omada Health on Thursday said it will start prescribing GLP-1s and other obesity drugs and helping patients manage those medications.Omada plans to expand the offerings under its weight management program as its membership grows to more than 800,000.The announcement comes as digital health companies increase their presence in the blockbuster market for GLP-1s to treat obesity, diabetes and other chronic conditions – a space that could be worth roughly $100 billion by the end of the decade, according to some analysts. Several digital health companies similarly offer prescriptions for GLP-1s, and the manufacturers of those drugs, Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk, are taking steps to make their treatments more accessible while also developing new ones for patients.\"The announcement is in response to our belief that access to GLP-1s will grow pretty significantly over time,\" Omada co-founder and CEO Sean Duffy said in an interview. He said Omada recognizes that the market will expand beyond GLP-1 injections to pills and other \"next-generation\" treatments that work in different ways, underscoring the need to help patients manage their medications. Programs from companies like Omada aim to support lifestyle and behavioral changes for patients on those drugs, offering nutrition guidance, education and a team of health coaches and exercise specialists, among other resources, that can help people stay on the drugs longer. But Omada is now tapping licensed providers trained in obesity care to prescribe medications and help patients manage the drugs. The new offering will allow the company to support patients as they receive a prescription and through the time they spend on a GLP-1. That kind of support is crucial, as GLP-1 injections can be complicated for patients to use properly and often come with gastrointestinal side effects that force some people to stop treatment.\"If you need to go up in dose, down in those, switch medications – you name it. We'll be able to support you through this experience,\" Duffy said.Omada, which partners with national and regional health plans and employers, also said the new offering is an add-on for customers to better support their workers' health needs while controlling costs and improving results from obesity treatments. Also on Thursday, Omada Health reported quarterly earnings for the second time since its initial public offering in June.The company, founded in 2011, offers virtual care programs to support patients with chronic conditions such as prediabetes, diabetes and hypertension. Omada describes its approach as a \"between-visit care model\" that is complementary to the broader health-care ecosystem.",

U.S. Attorney for D.C. Jeanine Pirro's prosecutors previously failed to get a grand jury in D.C. to indict the 37-year-old on a felony assault charge. Pirro's office then filed a misdemeanor charge against him, which went to trial this week. Jurors began deliberations on Wednesday.Dunn was charged in connection with tossing a sandwich at Customs and Border Protection Officer Greg Lairmore on on Aug. 10 along the U Street nightlife corridor in Washington.Lairmore and other federal authorities were deployed in D.C. by President Donald Trump in response to what the president claimed was rampant crime in the capital city.\"F--- you! You f---ing fascists! Why are you here? I don't want you in my city!\" Dunn allegedly shouted at a group of federal officers before hurling the sandwich at one of them. Dunn was fired by the DOJ, where he worked in the criminal division's international affairs section, after his arrest.A person walks past art work depicting former DOJ employee Sean Charles Dunn is displayed against a restaurant wall on August 17, 2025 in the Adams Morgan neighborhood of Washington. Tom Brenner | The Washington Post | Getty ImagesDunn's attorney, Sabrina Shroff, during closing arguments on Wednesday said that the confrontation was the result of his \"strongly held feelings\" about immigration enforcement, NBC News reported.Shroff also told jurors that \"you are the ones impacted by the executive orders\" issued by Trump which put federal law enforcement officers on the streets of D.C., NBC reported.\"You are the ones impacted by the executive orders … there was and remains a huge law enforcement presence in the district,' Shroff said.The defense attorney also argued that the, \"The sandwich did not impede Officer Lairmore's duties that night ....  A footlong from Subway could not and certainly did not inflict bodily harm,\" NBC reported.Shroff also noted that Lairmore had received two \"gag gifts\" from co-workers, a plush sandwich and a patch featuring a cartoon of Dunn throwing the sandwich with the words \"Felony Footlong,' according to the outlet.\"If someone assaulted you, if someone offended you, would you keep a  memento of their assault? Would you stick it on your daily lunchbox and carry it with you day in and day out?\" she asked.",

    "body": "The National Thanksgiving turkeys, Blossom and Peach, wait before being pardoned by U.S. President Joe Biden during a ceremony on the South Lawn of the White House on November 25, 2024 in Washington, DC. Andrew Harnik | Getty ImagesThe price of turkeys is soaring this Thanksgiving, and experts say consumers will have to hunt around to find a bargain for those birds.Driving the price hikes is a stressed turkey supply chain.The U.S. turkey flock has dropped to its lowest size in nearly 40 years because of the highly pathogenic avian influenza, according to the American Farm Bureau Federation.As a result, wholesale turkey prices have surged 75% since October 2024, according to an analysis by the Purdue University College of Agriculture.Wholesale turkey prices averaged 94 cents per pound at that point last year, compared with $1.71 per pound last month, according to U.S. Department of Agriculture data.Purdue University's model predicts that the average retail price of a turkey will be approximately $2.05 per pound in November, which is 25% higher than a year ago, costing consumers about $31 for a 15-pound bird.Purdue analysts emphasized that the actual retail price range of turkeys is wide because of differences in quality — organic or pasture-raised turkeys cost more.The timing of the turkey orders by retailers also is critical in determining price.\"Retailers that didn't secure their turkey orders early may face steep spot market prices, which could impact availability and cost,\" wrote Dr. Michael Swanson, chief agricultural economist for the Wells Fargo Agri-Food Institute.\"In contrast, those who waited may now be facing steep spot market prices,\" Swanson said.Spencer Platt | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesConsumers could end up paying $20 more for a 16-pound turkey if they buy it from a retailer who purchased it on the spot market, compared with what it would cost at a retailer who purchased the turkey earlier on the wholesale market.\"This year, where you shop could make a big difference, and savvy consumers may find significant savings by comparing options,\" Swanson said.Major retailers who placed early orders appear to be leveraging their turkeys as a draw to bring shoppers into stores, according to Swanson.Walmart is offering a dinner bundle, which includes a 16-pound turkey and sides, for under $56 for 10 people.A Thanksgiving bundle from Aldi's sells for $40 and feeds 10 people. Amazon is offering its own Thanksgiving dinner promotion for $25. Target on Wednesday announced a $20 Thanksgiving deal for four.Other grocers, such as ShopRite and Foodtown, are offering customers a free 10-to-20-pound store-brand turkey if they spend $400 by Thanksgiving. BJ's is running a similar promotion for $150.Wells Fargo's annual Thanksgiving food report shows that the typical cost of a turkey dinner for consumers is higher than those deals. A holiday menu that uses all store-brand items costs $80, while a menu with all national name brands totals $95, Wells Fargo's report said.\"Our report shows consumers spending more this Thanksgiving than on the retail promotions because we lean into a mix of prepared items and items that need assembly, which cost more versus making items from scratch,\" Swanson said.\"That mix in our view, more accurately portrays what we expect consumers to use for the meal this year.\"  In addition to the timing of purchases, the strength of supply-chain relationships between grocers and the farmers they work with has enabled some retailers to keep turkey prices from soaring.Customers push shopping carts outside a Stew Leonard's supermarket in Paramus, New Jersey, U.S., on Tuesday, May 12, 2020. Stew Leonard Jr. said that meat packing plant the company uses is operating at about 70 percent capacity, and he expects it to rebound to full capacity in about a month, CT Post reported.Angus Mordant | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesStew Leonard's — which operates a small chain of grocery stores in Connecticut, New York and New Jersey — said it was able to keep its turkey prices the same as last year because of its longstanding relationship with its bird supplier.\"We have been working with the same farm for decades, and the farm hasn't been impacted by bird flu,\" said Stew Leonard Jr., the chain's CEO.Thanksgiving dinner traditionally is considered one of the most affordable holiday meals, because red meat is not typically served.But given the increase in turkey prices, Leonard said, ham is a good alternative option for a Thanksgiving main course.Consumers could also opt to go to a butcher or store that will sell dark turkey meat or parts, which would cost less than a whole bird, he said.The reduction in flock size has led to layoffs for poultry producers.Perdue Farms in September announced it was laying off nearly 300 employees at an Indiana turkey plant, reportedly because of bird flu and a consumer shift toward other meats.One farmer who supplies Perdue said he lost 48,000 turkeys after a flu test came back positive.The USDA is forecasting an increase in turkey production in 2026, assuming the avian flu abates.But because of the current size of the flock, prices are not expected to drop considerably in 2026.The top eight states for turkey production are Minnesota, North Carolina, Arkansas, Indiana, Missouri, Virginia, Iowa and Pennsylvania. Turkey farms in North Dakota and South Dakota were hit with an outbreak of the flu in September.No new data on turkeys and agriculture is expected to be released by the USDA due to the government shutdown, which on Wednesday became the longest shutdown in U.S. history.",

    "body": "The Ford Lightning is seen at the New York International Auto Show on April 16, 2025.Danielle DeVries | CNBCDETROIT — Ford Motor is reportedly considering ending production of its all-electric F-150 Lightning pickup truck amid mounting losses and more challenging market conditions for EVs.The Wall Street Journal first reported the talks Thursday, adding they are ongoing and nothing has been finalized. A source familiar with Ford's product strategy confirmed to CNBC that the company has been evaluating its future EVs amid the company's losses and changing market conditions.\"What I can say is that F-150 Lightning is the best-selling electric pickup truck in the U.S. — despite new competition from CyberTruck, Chevy, GMC, Hummer and Rivian — and delivered record sales in Q3. Right now, we're focused on producing F-150 ICE and Hybrid as we recover from the fire at Novelis,\" a Ford spokesman said in an emailed statement Thursday, declining to comment on the discussions.Ford previously confirmed it paused production of the Lightning amid supply chain disruptions related to a fire at an aluminum plant for Novelis, a main supplier for the pickup truck.Ford President Kumar Galhotra, when asked last month by media about Lightning production potentially ending, said the company's main priority was gas-powered models. He said F-150 Lightning production could restart whenever the company would like but declined to give a timeframe.The F-150 Lightning, which Ford once said was as important to the company as founder Henry Ford's Model T, never lived up to internal or external expectations. The pickup initially received more than 200,000 nonbinding reservations that failed to convert to sales.F-150 Lightning sales this year through October are roughly level compared with a year earlier at only 24,577 units. Since going on sale in 2022 in the U.S., Ford has sold less than 100,000 F-150 Lightning models.The Lightning is produced at a facility connected to a large F-150 production plant in metro Detroit.Ford's EV operations, including the Lightning, have lost the company billions of dollars annually in recent years.The U.S. EV market has faced daunting changes in regulations under the Trump administration this year, including the end of consumer credits of up to $7,500 for the purchase of an EV.The reported discussions at Ford follow crosstown rival Stellantis deciding to end plans to produce an all-electric Ram 1500 pickup as well as General Motors significantly scaling back its plans for electric trucks.",

Top proxy advisors Glass Lewis and ISS recommended voting against it.Results of the vote were announced on Thursday at the company's annual shareholders meeting in Austin, Texas.A separate proposal, submitted by an individual investor, Stephen Hawk, called for Tesla to be able to invest in xAI, Musk's artificial intelligence startup that was formed in March 2023 to compete with OpenAI. Brandon Ehrhart, general counsel at Tesla, said at the meeting that the company had \"received more votes in favor than we did in against,\" but that there were a number of abstentions and that Tesla is considering next steps.The pay package for Musk, already the world's richest person, consists of 12 tranches of shares to be granted if Tesla hits certain milestones over the next decade. It would also give Musk increased voting power over the company, acceding to demands that he's made publicly since early 2024. His ownership would increase from about 13% to 25%, adding more than 423 million shares to his holdings.The first tranche of stock gets paid out if Tesla hits a market capitalization of $2 trillion. Tesla's current market cap is $1.54 trillion.The next nine tranches would be awarded if Tesla's value increases by increments of $500 billion, up to $6.5 trillion. Musk would earn the last two tranches if the market cap rises by increments of $1 trillion, meaning it would need to hit $8.5 trillion for Musk to get the full package.Tesla also laid out a series of earnings milestones for Musk, beginning with $50 billion in annual adjusted profit and moving up to $400 billion. In the third quarter, Tesla reported adjusted EBITDA of $4.2 billion.Other goals tied to the newly approved pay plan include reaching 20 million vehicle deliveries, 10 million active FSD (Full Self-Driving) subscriptions​, 1 million bots (Optimus humanoid robots) delivered and​ 1 million robotaxis in commercial operation. To date, Tesla has delivered more than 8 million vehicles, according to its September proxy statement.The proposed plan doesn't specify whether the FSD subscriptions must be purchased or could include free trials. Tesla currently provides partially automated driving systems, which it markets as \"FSD Supervised\" in the U.S. The company intends to improve its FSD Supervised systems so they don't require human supervision on board.At the meeting, Musk claimed that Optimus robots \"will eliminate poverty,\" \"give everyone amazing medical care,\" and will be \"bigger than cell phones, bigger than anything.\" He also said the robots could be used for \"containment of future crime\" by following criminals around and stopping them from \"doing crime.\"There's currently no Optimus robot on the market, and Musk didn't provide a target date for reaching those goals.As Reuters previously reported, Musk could still score tens of billions of dollars without meeting most of the targets laid out for him by the board, collecting more than $50 billion just by hitting a handful of the more attainable goals.There are also a list of \"covered events\" in the award terms that would allow Musk to earn shares without meeting the required operational milestones.Covered events include natural disasters, wars, pandemics, and changes to \"international, federal, state and local law, regulations or other governmental action or inaction,\" that could hamper the company's ability to design, manufacture or sell its products down the line.Shareholders voted on the new plan after the Delaware Court of Chancery ruled last year that Musk's earlier 2018 pay plan was improperly granted by the Tesla board and must be rescinded. Musk appealed that ruling and the matter will be decided by the Delaware State Supreme Court.In addition to leading Tesla, Musk runs xAI which has merged with X, leads SpaceX and its satellite internet business Starlink, and is a founder of brain computer interface company Neuralink and tunneling venture The Boring Company.He's also been heavily engaged in politics, most notably working to propel President Donald Trump back to the White House, and then leading a sweeping effort to slash the federal government at the beginning of his second term.The National Bureau of Economic Research published a paper last month estimating that Tesla sales from October 2022 through April of this year in the U.S. would have been 67% to 83% higher without Musk's \"polarizing and partisan actions.\"The newly approved pay plan puts no limits on Musk's political activity, and does not establish a minimum amount of time he must spend working at Tesla.WATCH: Tesla shareholders approve Musk's pay planwatch now",

    "body": "OpenAI CEO Sam Altman speaks to media following a Q&amp;A at the OpenAI data center in Abilene, Texas, U.S., Sept. 23, 2025.  Shelby Tauber | ReutersOpenAI CEO Sam Altman said Thursday that the artificial intelligence startup is on track to generate more than $20 billion in annualized revenue run rate this year, with plans to grow to hundreds of billions in sales by 2030.The company has inked more than $1.4 trillion of infrastructure deals in recent months to try and build out the data centers it says are needed to meet growing demand. The staggering sum has raised questions from investors and others in the industry about where OpenAI will come up with the money.\"We are trying to build the infrastructure for a future economy powered by AI, and given everything we see on the horizon in our research program, this is the time to invest to be really scaling up our technology,\" Altman wrote in a post on X. \"Massive infrastructure projects take quite awhile to build, so we have to start now.\"OpenAI was founded as a nonprofit research lab in 2015, but has become one of the fastest-growing commercial entities on the planet following the launch of its chatbot ChatGPT in 2022. The startup is currently valued at $500 billion, though it's still not profitable.In September, OpenAI CFO Sarah Friar told CNBC that OpenAI was on track to generate $13 billion in revenue this year.Friar caught the attention of the Trump administration this week after she saying at at event that OpenAI is looking to create an ecosystem of banks, private equity and a federal \"backstop\" or \"guarantee\" that could help the company finance its investments in cutting-edge chips. She clarified those comments late Wednesday, writing in a post on LinkedIn that OpenAI is not seeking a government backstop for its infrastructure commitments.\"I used the word 'backstop' and it muddied the point,\" Friar wrote. \"As the full clip of my answer shows, I was making the point that American strength in technology will come from building real industrial capacity which requires the private sector and government playing their part.\"Venture capitalist David Sacks, who is serving as President Donald Trump's AI and crypto czar, said Thursday that there will be \"no federal bailout for AI.\" He wrote in a post on X that if one frontier model company in the U.S. fails, another will take its place.Altman said Thursday that OpenAI does \"not have or want government guarantees for OpenAI datacenters.\" He said taxpayers should not bail out companies that make poor decisions, and that \"if we get it wrong, that's on us.\"\"This is the bet we are making, and given our vantage point, we feel good about it,\" Altman wrote. \"But we of course could be wrong, and the market—not the government—will deal with it if we are.\"WATCH: Trump AI czar David Sacks says ‘no federal bailout for AI’ after OpenAI CFO’s commentswatch now",

Big deals from Palo Alto Networks and Alphabet, and initial public offerings from Netskope and SailPoint have also put the sector in the spotlight.Toronto-based 1Password was founded in 2005 and counts IBM, Perplexity AI, Salesforce and the Golden State Warriors among its customers, and it's also signed a multiyear deal with Formula 1 team Oracle Red Bull Racing. The company says it secures more than 1.3 billion human and machine credentials and works with 180,000 business customers.Additionally, 1Password on Thursday announced it is bringing on former ChargePoint and Barracuda Networks executive Michael Hughes. Former Qualtrics and SAP executive John Torrey will join as chief business officer.Faugno said both executives complement the company's strategy to lure larger enterprise customers.Over the last year, 1Password has undergone a major C-suite shake-up.Longtime leader Jeff Shiner, who ran 1Password for 13 years, transitioned into executive chair of the board in July. Faugno, who had been promoted to co-CEO a few months earlier, took over the role solely at that time. Faugno joined 1Password in 2023 as president and operating chief.To date, 1Password has raised about $950 million and is valued at $6.8 billion, according to Pitchbook data. Other investors include actor Justin Timberlake, comedian Trevor Noah, CrowdStrike CEO George Kurtz and investment firm Iconiq, according to Pitchbook.Faugno told CNBC that the company is weighing a possible IPO in 2026 or 2027, but isn't \"rushing out to go public.\" He said 1Password remains focused on providing the best tools for its customers.\"We control our own destiny,\" he said. \"From a profitability perspective, we have investors that are playing the long game with us.\"WATCH: CrowdStrike CEO: Don't buy idea AI will kill software, need it to protect AIwatch now",

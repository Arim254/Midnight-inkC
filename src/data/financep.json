    "body": "Engineering majors earn some of the highest salaries right after college — and they're still near the top years later.That's according to the latest findings from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, based on 2024 U.S. Census data, the most recent available.The analysis breaks down annual earnings for college graduates by major and reflects the income of full-time workers whose highest degree is a bachelor's, excluding currently enrolled students. Various engineering degrees have consistently ranked among the top-paying fields in recent years.The highest-paying majors for workers ages 22 to 27 are computer engineering, computer science and chemical engineering, with recent graduates earning median early-career salaries of $85,000 or more. That's well above the U.S  median personal income of just over $45,000, according to U.S. Census Bureau data. However, engineering accounts for about 6% of bachelor's degrees awarded nationwide, representing a relatively small share of all college graduates, according to the most recent data from the National Center for Education Statistics.Here are the 18 majors that lead to the highest salaries for workers ages 22 to 27:Computer engineering: $90,000Computer science: $87,000Chemical engineering: $85,000Aerospace engineering: $85,000Industrial engineering: $83,000Electrical engineering: $82,000Mechanical engineering: $80,000Construction services: $75,000Civil engineering: $75,000General engineering: $75,000Miscellaneous engineering: $75,000Economics: $72,000Business analytics: $72,000Finance: $70,000Mathematics: $70,000Nursing: $70,000Mathematics: $70,000Finance: $70,000Engineering graduates remain in strong demand for their mix of mathematical skills and technical expertise, which are valuable across a wide range of industries, data from the National Association of Colleges and Employers shows.While artificial intelligence is reshaping how the technical work is done, employment in many engineering fields is still projected to grow over the next decade, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.Engineering also tends to pay well over time. Among graduates ages 35 to 45, every engineering major reports median pay of at least $100,000. Here are all of the majors with mid-career median earnings of $100,000 or more, according to the New York Fed.Chemical engineering: $135,000Computer engineering: $131,000Aerospace engineering: $130,000Electrical engineering: $123,000Computer science: $120,000Mechanical engineering: $120,000Construction services: $120,000Civil engineering: $115,000Economics: $115,000Finance: $112,000Business analytics: $109,000General engineering: $105,000Miscellaneous engineering: $105,000Physics: $105,000Engineering technologies: $104,000Industrial engineering: $100,000Mathematics: $100,000Information systems: $100,000Marketing: $100,000Biochemistry: $100,000Political science: $100,000In contrast, education and arts majors tend to earn significantly less overall. By ages 35 to 45, six fields of education majors report median earnings below $60,000, placing them among the lower-paid fields in the study.Want to improve your communication, confidence and success at work?

    "body": "Julia Holden can relate to the struggle of getting your baby to fall asleep.In February 2024, she and her husband noticed that their newborn son Maxime fell asleep more quickly when his eyes were gently covered with a burp cloth or small towel, she says. As a new mom \"in survival mode,\" Holden quickly looked for a purchasable product — a comfortable eye covering that'd stay on his tiny face if he moved — but couldn't find one she liked, she says.As a younger adult, Holden had dreamed of entrepreneurship, so her near-instant thought was to make this product herself and sell it, she says. She designed a baby hat with an attached eye covering, named her side hustle Sleepy Hat and, over the course of the next year, spent nearly $16,000 from her personal savings to bootstrap the business, she says.Since June 2025, the business has brought in five figures in revenue each month, including over $90,000 in December and more than $69,000 in January, according to documents reviewed by CNBC Make It. The company is profitable, says Holden, who initially launched it while working full-time as a senior relationship manager for an advertising company and taking care of her baby.She found time for Sleepy Hat in 20-minute windows between breast-feedings at her home in Lawrence Township, New Jersey, she says. \"I had no outside funding, no team and no child care beyond family help,\" says Holden, 34.DON'T MISS: How to read people and master your body language to be more influential at workHolden quit her job — which paid her $95,000 a year, she says — in October to focus on Sleepy Hat full-time. Most of its profits have been reinvested back into the business, including payroll for two-part-time contractors who help with inventory and running ads on Google and Amazon, she says. \"I also recently took on an advisor, [who has] a little bit of equity,\" Holden says.Holden paid herself $2,500 from the business in 2025, and has been living off her remaining personal savings and her husband's income as an assistant director at Princeton University. She works anywhere from 30 to 60 hours per week, including weekends, she says. Doing all of that while being a mom to a now-2-year-old is taxing, but since she sets her own schedule, she can at least take more time during daylight hours for herself and her family than she did at a 9-to-5, she says.\"I'm still stressed, but for a more meaningful reason,\" says Holden. \"It feels more important. It's much more satisfying.\"'My first sale from a stranger was life-changing'Holden didn't have \"proof of market fit\" when she decided to launch Sleepy Hat, she says. Rather, she brought the idea to other moms in her circle, who she says all called it \"genius.\"She intended to spend about $10,000 launching the business, and surpassed her budget on \"product development, creating patterns, creating prototypes and samples ... and then all the tiny little things that add up, like purchasing a domain, a trademark [and] building a website,\" she says.She didn't have a design background, so the first pattern she and her mom created together resulted in a hat that was \"completely the wrong size,\" she says. An entrepreneur friend referred her to a factory in China, which sent her prototypes. But her \"tech pack\" — a garment blueprint for manufacturers, essentially — initially wasn't detailed enough, resulting in about $1,500 worth of defective products, she says.Before creating the \"Sleepy Hat,\" Holden would use a cloth to limit visual distractions during nap time for her son, Maxime.Julia HoldenAfter finalizing the product's design and ordering 1,500 units, Holden \"splurged\" on a photographer to fill a website for Sleepy Hat with professional-looking images, she says. The website launched in September 2024, and didn't receive many sales until around December, when Holden posted her product and website on online marketplace Grommet, she says.Sleepy Hat ended the year with just under $2,000 in total sales. \"My first sale from a stranger was life-changing,\" says Holden. \"I was so excited but also terrified to actually ship the product.\"Holden joined Amazon as a third-party seller in August 2025. Roughly around then, her posts on Sleepy Hat's TikTok account started gaining traction, with some garnering hundreds of thousands of views and thousands of likes. Moms bonded in the comments over their \"FOMO babies\" who fought sleep while on walks, car rides or in restaurants, saying they \"needed\" the hat for their kids.The road to 'six-figures plus'Most of Holden's sales now come from paid online advertising, she says. She's designing Sleepy Hats with new patterns and materials, improving her social media strategy and updating her packaging, she adds.\"The goal is to increase my own salary on a quarterly basis this year,\" says Holden. \"I hope to double what I pay myself in Q2 in April ... I hope next year to be able to pay myself actually more than what I was making at my full-time job, so six-figures plus.\"Holden isn't technically a first-time entrepreneur — she previously started a short-lived T-shirt brand and website for women runners — but she's still working on her financial acumen and organizational skills, she says. She's worked with an accountant, alongside her advisor, to help her cover that weakness, she says.The original Sleepy Hat sketch Holden came up with in 2024.Julia Holden\"You need to understand every dollar that's coming out and every dollar that's coming in,\" she says. \"And I'm not particularly finite. I just don't gravitate towards spreadsheets ... So it's definitely been a learning curve to force myself to take the time and understand the balance sheet and where every dollar is going, and it's still a work in progress.\"Holden has also learned the value of trusting her gut, she says. She recalls a moment when her sister, who owns a PowerPoint tutorial business, advised against launching a startup as a new mom.\"She was like, 'I would not start a business right now. You're [freshly] postpartum,'\" Holden says. \"And I was like, 'OK, I hear you. I'm going to do it anyway.'\"Want to improve your communication, confidence and success at work? Take CNBC's new online course, Master Your Body Language To Boost Your Influence.

US CENTCOM | Anadolu | Getty ImagesPresident Donald Trump said Friday that he is considering limited military strikes to pressure Iran over its nuclear program. \"I guess I can say I am considering that,\" Trump said when asked by a reporter at a White House breakfast with U.S. governors. Trump said Thursday that he would make a decision in the next 10 to 15 days on whether to attack the Islamic Republic. He has left open the possibility that a deal could still be reached with Tehran over its nuclear program. Trump has previously said an attack on Iran would be \"far worse\" than the limited strikes launched by the U.S. in June against its nuclear facilities.Oil prices were stable Friday after rallying more than 5% this week as traders price in some risk of imminent U.S. military action. U.S. crude oil fell 4 cents to close at $66.39 per barrel. Global benchmark Brent rose 10 cents to settle at $71.76 per barrel.A massive U.S. military buildup is underway in the Middle East. The USS Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier is in the region. A second aircraft carrier, the USS Gerald Ford, is en route. The oil market's biggest fear is that a conflict between the U.S. and Iran could lead to a prolonged disruption of oil flows through the Strait of Hormuz. The strait is a vital chokepoint for the global oil trade. More than 14 million barrels per day of oil and condensates passed through the narrow waterway on average in 2025, according to data from consulting firm Kpler, which says that amount accounts for a third of total worldwide seaborne oil exports.About three-quarters of the oil that passes through the strait goes to China, India, Japan and South Korea, according to Kpler.watch now",

    "body": "People are nostalgic for a simpler time without smartphones, social media and AI. Cat Goetze is dialed in. The 29-year-old in Los Angeles is the founder of Physical Phones, a Bluetooth-enabled landline phone business that's taken off in recent months.In 2025, her business brought in over $789,000 in sales, according to documents reviewed by CNBC Make It.But like all \"overnight\" success stories, Goetze has been working at it for a while now.Call waitingGoetze says she first had the idea for a landline-style phone product in 2023 after spending the better part of the pandemic trying to reduce her screentime. She daydreamed about her childhood sharing a landline with her family.Cat Goetze is the founder of Physical Phones, a Bluetooth-enabled landline style phone.Tristan Pelletier | CNBC Make It\"When I grew up, there was this booklet that the school sent out to all of the families in the school district that literally had all of the students' names and their home phone numbers,\" Goetze says. \"I distinctly remember prank calling some of the other people in the school using that phone book.\"But when she looked into what it would take to actually install a landline in her home, including getting a new phone number and paying the $80 monthly service she was quoted, she set out to find a different way.As a creator, your job is really to kind of hold an antenna out into the zeitgeist and pick up on what people want creatively, spiritually, emotionally.Cat Goetzefounder of Physical Phones\"With my technical background, I thought to myself, it probably wouldn't be that difficult to just hook up a landline phone to my smartphone,\" says Goetze, who pursued an interdisciplinary major in science, technology and society at Stanford. \"Then I started tinkering around and prototyping and figuring out a way to build that.\"In 2023, Goetze built a prototype of her first phone, a pink handset, and posted it to TikTok. At the time, she didn't have much of a social media audience, and the post got no traction or sales.\"I was like, OK , whatever, that's fine. This was like a fun project,\" she says. \"I wasn't really trying to make money off of it anyways.\"Two years later, in 2025, she'd gained a following for her online brand, CatGPT, where she discusses AI and digital wellness. She was also noticing more people talking about wanting to reduce their smartphone dependence. It reminded her of her landline phone prototype, so she posted about it again.That video from July 2025 went viral, getting over 8 million views across Instagram and TikTok. The product, officially branded Physical Phones, passed $120,000 in sales in its first three days.\"As a creator, your job is really to kind of hold an antenna out into the zeitgeist and pick up on what people want creatively, spiritually, emotionally,\" she says. When she revisited the idea at just the right moment, \"it took off.\"Christina Locopo | CNBC Make ItDialing up the businessPhysical Phones are battery-powered and connect to a smartphone via Bluetooth.Once connected, the landline acts just like your cellphone. If your phone rings, the landline will too, and you can carry out your call from the handset. To make an outbound call, you can use the landline set to directly dial the number.For most of us who no longer memorize phone numbers, you can also pick up the handset and dial star (*) to activate the voice assistant on your phone, like Siri, where you can direct it to dial a certain contact.The Physical Phone also works with audio calls from FaceTime and Whatsapp.Pre-orders for Physical Phones opened in July 2025 and fully funded the first round of production, covering things like warehousing, shipping, printing, hiring and \"everything else that we needed to actually get the business off the ground,\" Goetze says. Physical Phones currently sells three styles of phones — a handset, a wall mount and a rotary version — that range in price from $90 to $110.Tristan Pelletier | CNBC Make ItThe business sources phones from a manufacturer in Asia, meaning it also lost a \"whopping portion\" of profits due to tariffs under the Trump administration's new policy, Goetze says.Goetze says working with a manufacturer was the hardest part of the process of launching Physical Phones because she'd never done it before and, as she learned, it can be time-intensive.\"It's pretty draining, honestly, because what I underestimated before building Physical Phones was just how every single detail gets pored over for a hardware product,\" she says. It took two to three months to finalize the first Physical Phone, she adds.Goetze says her goal with the first round of orders was to deliver them to customers by December 2025 in time for Christmas.Shipping everything by cargo boat would have taken too long, Goetze says. The only way for them to meet their goal was to fly all the phones from the manufacturer in Asia to their warehouse in California by cargo plane.The endeavor cost the company nearly $74,000, which covered the international freight charge; customs entry fee; and delivery, service and administrative expenses.\"It was a huge hit to our profit margin,\" Goetze says. \"But I also think that it's those kinds of decisions where you really stand up for your customer and you show them how much you care.\"Cat Goetze posted a call for pre-orders of Physical Phones in July 2025. The business passed $120,000 in sales within three days.Tristan Pelletier | CNBC Make ItOnce they got all the phones to their warehouse, Goetze says she and her team \"called in every single friend, family member, colleague, neighbor that I knew and basically asked anybody with a pair of hands to come to the warehouse and help us break down and ship all of these phones within 24 hours.\"Goetze says she and her team prepared 4,000 orders for delivery across the U.S. in December 2025.Ringing off the hookPhysical Phones currently sells three styles of phones, including a handset, wall mount and rotary phone, which range in price from $90 to $110. To date, Goetze says the business has sold over 7,500 devices.Physical Phones made about $439,000 in profit in 2025, which Goetze says she reinvests back into the business for research and development for new models, and to hire for her small team of four.Christina Locopo | CNBC Make ItGoetze doesn't take a salary from Physical Phones and supports herself with earnings from her CatGPT media business, which includes branded content and content partnerships.She recently hired a CEO, Josh Silverman, who was brought on during the first round of production and now runs the business day-to-day. Looking ahead, 2026 is all about growing Physical Phones through potentially selling to retail, Goetze says.Cat Goetze is soon launching Cat Labs, a creator-first product studio where she plans to build new products, apps, websites and services.Tristan Pelletier | CNBC Make It\"One of the main questions that we're toying with right now is: Do we want to continue to have this sort of drop model where we ship out large quantities of inventory at a time, or do we want to have more of a traditional e-commerce or evergreen model where we have stock consistently?\" she says. \"There's pros and cons to each.\"Goetze is soon launching Cat Labs, a creator-first product studio where she plans to build new      products, apps, websites and services.\"As a creator-founder,\" Goetze says, \"my zone of genius, if you will, comes from my ability to stick that cultural antenna up into the air and understand what my audience wants, and being able to predict and build what they want next.\"Want to improve your communication, confidence and success at work?

    "body": "U.S. President Donald Trump speaks during a press briefing held at the White House February 20, 2026 in Washington, DC. Kevin Dietsch | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesPresident Donald Trump on Saturday said he would increase global tariffs to 15% from 10%, one day after the Supreme Court struck down a broad swath of the president's trade agenda. In a Truth Social post, Trump said the new tariffs will be \"effective immediately.\" He also warned that additional levies would follow.  \"I, as President of the United States of America, will be, effective immediately, raising the 10% Worldwide Tariff on Countries, many of which have been \"ripping\" the U.S. off for decades, without retribution (until I came along!), to the fully allowed, and legally tested, 15% level,\" he wrote.\"During the next short number of months, the Trump Administration will determine and issue the new and legally permissible Tariffs,\" he added.Trump's announcement claimed that the new tariffs will take effect without delay, but it is unclear if any official documents have been signed detailing the timing. A White House fact sheet issued Friday said the original 10% tariffs would go into effect on Tuesday, Feb. 24, at 12:01 a.m. ET.The White House did not immediately respond to a CNBC request for clarification.watch nowTrump, who is scheduled to deliver his State of the Union address to Congress on Tuesday, was dealt a blow Friday when the Supreme Court decided in a 6-3 tariff ruling that the president wrongfully invoked the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to implement his levies. On Friday, Trump responded hours after the ruling with a 10% global tariff that he invoked under Section 122 of the Trade Act of 1974. The statute allows the president to impose temporary levies for 150 days. Any extension requires congressional approval.The president was scathing in his remarks against the Supreme Court decision, calling the ruling \"ridiculous, poorly written, and extraordinarily anti-American\" in a social media post.

Republicans were more divided on the issue. Some slammed the Supreme Court for its decision, while others argued that Congress has the constitutional authority to implement levies. On Friday, stocks rallied initially following the Supreme Court decision, before pulling back and then recovering again. Investors expect the ruling could allay tensions between the U.S. and its trading partners, and possibly refund affected companies and reduce inflation.How the U.S. government will proceed with refunds remains a question. By one estimate, the U.S.  government could owe more than $175 billion in refunds to importers following the Supreme Court decision.",

    "body": "U.S. growth slowed more than expected near the end of 2025 as the government shutdown impacted spending and investment, while a key inflation metric showed high prices are still a factor for the economy, according to data released Friday.Gross domestic product rose at an annualized rate of just 1.4%, according to the Commerce Department, well below the Dow Jones estimate for a 2.5% gain. Consumer spending increased at a slower pace for the period while government spending tumbled sharply in a quarter marked by the record-length shutdown. The department estimated that the shutdown subtracted about 1 percentage point from growth, though it added that the exact impacts \"cannot be quantified.\"For the full year in 2025, the U.S. economy grew at a 2.2% pace, down from the 2.8% increase in 2024. \"The Federal government shutdown clearly sent the economy careening off its strong growth path in the fourth quarter which is a one-off that won't be repeated in early 2026,\" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at Fwdbonds.Just before the data release, President Donald Trump warned that the GDP number would be soft, blaming it on the government shutdown that ended in November.\"The Democrat Shutdown cost the U.S.A. at least two points in GDP. That's why they are doing it, in mini form, again. No Shutdowns!\" Trump said in a Truth Social post. \"Also, LOWER INTEREST RATES. 'Two Late' Powell is the WORST!!!\"The latter part of the post was a reference to Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, whom Trump has repeatedly criticized for not lowering rates more aggressively.While growth slowed, inflation held firm in December, according to the gauge most closely watched by Fed officials.The core personal consumption expenditures price index, which excludes food and energy, rose 3% in December, up 0.2 percentage point from November, according to a separate release. That matched the consensus forecast but kept the pivotal inflation measure well above the Fed's 2% target.On a headline basis, the PCE index accelerated 2.9%, or 0.1 percentage point higher than expected. Both indexes rose 0.4% for the month, compared with the respective forecasts for 0.3%.On a monthly basis, goods prices climbed 0.4% while services increased 0.3%, indicating that price pressures remained relatively broad-based rather than concentrated in any single category. Fed policymakers have been watching that balance closely to see whether inflation is being spurred by temporary tariff-related pressures that would hit goods, or more fundamental demand-driven factors that would show up in services.The Fed cut its benchmark rate by three-quarters of a percentage point in late 2025 but has since signaled a more cautious approach as officials assess progress on inflation alongside risks to the labor market.While Trump blamed the shutdown, the Commerce Department said the deceleration in GDP, which grew at a 4.4% rate in the third quarter, was the result in a pullback in consumer spending and exports, as well as the impact from the government closure that ran from Oct. 1 to Nov. 12.\"The government shutdown hurt growth at the end of 2025. The economy will likely bounce back in early 2026, but it isn't harmless to do prolonged shutdowns,\" said Heather Long, chief economist at Navy Federal Credit Union. \"Overall, the U.S. economy was resilient in 2025 despite many headwinds. Solid consumption and the AI boom kept the economy growing.\"Personal consumption expenditures, a proxy for consumer outlays, rose 2.4% in the quarter, down from the 3.5% gain in the prior period. Exports fell 0.9% after surging 9.6% in Q3.Though the headline GDP number looked weak, underlying signs of demand were strong.Another key Fed metric, called final sales to private domestic purchasers, posted a 2.4% increase for the quarter, half a percentage point lower than the prior quarter but still indicative of solid underlying demand in the $31.5 trillion U.S. economy.Also, gross private domestic investment rose 3.8% after being flat in Q3.On the downside, government spending and investment slid 5.1%, slammed by a 16.6% tumble at the federal level that was only partially offset by a 2.4% increase from state and local entities. Correction: Final sales to private domestic purchasers posted a 2.4% increase for the quarter, half a percentage point lower than the prior quarter. An earlier version misstated a time element.",

The social media giant is facing trials in both California and New Mexico that accuse Meta of misleading the public about the safety of apps like Instagram.CEO Mark Zuckerberg testified this week in Los Angeles Superior Court in a trial involving a plaintiff dubbed KGM, who alleges that she became addicted to apps like Instagram and YouTube due to certain design features, thus suffering great mental anguish.Meta is also involved in a separate, ongoing trial in New Mexico where the state's attorney general has alleged that Meta failed to safeguard its apps from online predators.The company has denied the allegations in both of those cases.Meta declined to comment. CNBC has reached out to the National PTA for any additional comment.The National PTA and Meta \"have had a funding relationship since 2017,\" Johnson wrote, saying that the previous agreement ended on Dec. 31, 2025.Read more CNBC tech newsTesla loses bid to toss $243 million verdict in fatal Autopilot crash suitMeta and Apple face serious questions about child safety and privacyFrom 'vanlords' to safe parking sites: How RVs became Silicon Valley's housing safety netWho's laughing now?

Saul Loeb | Afp | Getty ImagesAirlines canceled more than 5,000 flights through Monday and waived cancellation and change fees for airports spanning Virginia to Maine ahead of another massive winter storm on the East Coast, set to once again put carriers to the test at the tail-end of winter break.The National Weather Service issued a blizzard warning for much of New Jersey, the New York City area, and parts of Maryland, Connecticut, Rhode Island and Massachusetts. The storm could dump more than 2 feet of snow in some areas as well as bring wind gusts of more than 40 miles per hour. The NWS warned that travel will be trecherous with low visibility.About two-thirds of the flights to New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport and LaGuardia Airport were canceled on Sunday as were around 40% of the departures, according to FlightAware. Disruptions are set to worsen on Monday with snow continuining to fall. More than 70% of Monday departures were canceled at Boston Logan International Airport.Airlines routinely cancel flights ahead of major storms to avoid having aircraft and crews out of place and to make it easier to restart operations after the storm passes.Delta Air Lines, American Airlines, JetBlue Airways, United Airlines and Spirit Airlines waived fees and fare differences for passengers if they can travel as late as Feb. 26.

There were times it didn't move at all. On Wednesday, I had events and interviews at three different hotels and getting the team around to these appointments on time was a real challenge.India hosted one of the biggest AI events in the world that was marred by some chaos and confusion. Photo: AI Impact Summit 2026Arjun KharpalAt one point on Thursday, were weren't even sure if we'd be able to enter the Bharat Mandapam, the venue where the summit took place. That's because instructions were not clear on when media would be allowed in on Thursday when Prime Minister Narendra Modi inaugurated the event.We eventually found out we could enter at 6 a.m. local time. When we turned up, security did not let us in until later, not before a crowd of media had gathered at the gates. Inside, security were giving out conflicting instructions. Several delegates expressed to me their frustrations over the organization of the summit. The event itself was marred by other controversies. Bill Gates, who was named in the Epstein files, was scheduled to give a keynote address. There was then uncertainty if he would even turn up. The Gates Foundation had said earlier in the week that he would give the speech, but then on Thursday said the billionaire had pulled out.Meanwhile, a university was reportedly kicked out of the summit for suggesting a robot dog they were showcasing was its own creation. A professor at Galgotias University told state-run broadcaster DD News that the robot, which was actually made by Chinese firm Unitree, was \"developed\" by the academic institution.India hosted one of the biggest AI events in the world that was marred by some chaos and confusion.

Modi had delegates on stage with everyone holding hands. But OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei didn't do as they they'd been instructed, in a moment that instantly got scrutinized across social media. Altman later explained that he was \"confused\" and wasn't sure what he should be doing.Days earlier, Anthropic ran a Super Bowl ad taking digs at OpenAI's decision to test advertisements in ChatGPT. India's lureDespite all of these moments, the event pulled in a who's who of tech names from Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai to Altman, all of whom talked up India's advantages from a huge talent pool to a large consumer market. \"The excitement here, it's just been incredible to watch,\" Altman told me.

    "body": "The Supreme Court during a rain storm in Washington, Feb. 20, 2026.Annabelle Gordon | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesThe Supreme Court on Friday ruled that President Donald Trump's country-specific \"reciprocal\" tariffs are unconstitutional, delivering a win for many consumer companies facing higher import costs.But the ruling doesn't cover all sectors. The Supreme Court reviewed tariffs enacted under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977, or IEEPA, which the Trump administration used to justify the sweeping tariff agenda. The act had never before been used by a president to impose tariffs.In a 6-3 decision, the Supreme Court ruled that IEEPA \"does not authorize the President to impose tariffs.\" Still, hours after the ruling, Trump announced a new global 10% tariff, and the Supreme Court's ruling does not cover tariffs enacted under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962. Those duties are intended to target specific products that threaten national security, and they remain in effect after Friday's ruling. Separate from his country-specific rates, Trump has raised tariffs on imports of steel, semiconductors, aluminum and other products deemed to impair national security. Here are the sectors still facing higher levies even after the Supreme Court decision.AutosIt's not immediately clear how much the decision will impact the U.S. and global automotive industry. The industry continues to face billions of dollars in tariff costs, depending on where an imported auto part or vehicle originates.The Trump administration last year broadly implemented 25% tariffs on vehicles and certain auto parts imported into the U.S., citing national security risks. It has since struck independent deals to lower the levies to 10% to 15% with countries such as the United Kingdom and Japan. Others, such as South Korea, have also struck deals for lower rates, but it's unclear if those changes have actually taken effect.\"With today's decision out and subsequent developments, there remain many unknowns and important questions still to be answered. This is not a moment to ease up,\" said Lenny LaRocca, U.S. automotive lead for consulting firm KPMG. \"Automakers should continue planning for multiple scenarios and keep supply chain considerations top of mind as the trade and tariff landscape continues to evolve.\"America's largest automaker, General Motors, last month said it expects between $3 billion and $4 billion in tariff costs this year, and Ford Motor earlier this month said its net tariff impact is expected to be roughly flat year over year at $2 billion in 2026.Ford told CNBC in a statement that it is continuing to work with the government on policies that \"promote a strong and globally competitive U.S. auto sector.\" GM did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the Supreme Court decision.PharmaceuticalsThe pharmaceutical industry is facing a lot of uncertainty over tariffs. Trump has repeatedly threatened tariffs on pharmaceutical imports, though they haven't yet taken effect, in part because of negotiated multiyear deals between the administration and drugmakers. If that were to change, however, pharmaceutical tariffs would still be covered under Section 232.The administration has floated imposing tariffs on the industry that could eventually reach up to 250%. Last July, Trump threatened 200% tariffs on pharmaceuticals, and the administration has already opened a Section 232 investigation into pharmaceuticals to investigate the impact of imports on national security.The tariff threats are a move to push drug companies to manufacture in the U.S. instead of abroad. In December, multiple companies inked a deal with Trump to voluntarily lower their prices in exchange for a three-year exemption from any pharma tariffs — as long as they invest further in U.S. manufacturing. That deal included major players like Merck, Bristol Myers Squibb, Novartis and more. FurnitureThe furniture industry found little relief from Friday's Supreme Court ruling.Last fall, items like couches, kitchen cabinets, vanities and more were hit with higher tariffs under Section 232. The roughly 25% duties will remain in place even now that the IEEPA tariffs have been deemed unconstitutional. The furniture industry is already facing greater uncertainty, with the 25% tariff expected to rise to 50% in 2027, and more broad pressures from higher interest rates and inflation. Smaller companies are getting hit the hardest, with fewer resources to work with, while larger companies are facing bankruptcy, like Value City Furniture's parent company, American Signature Furniture, which went out of business late last year.Food and consumer packaged goodsUnder Section 232, steel and aluminum imports into the U.S. are still carry tariffs. With higher aluminum tariffs, companies like Coca-Cola, PepsiCo, Keurig Dr Pepper and Reynolds will continue to face higher costs associated with manufacturing their products.Trump hiked aluminum tariffs to 50% last year.Still, some of the key tariffs for the sector have been rolled back, even before Friday's ruling.In November, Trump issued an executive order exempting several hundred agricultural products, including bananas, coffee and spices, from tariffs. And in September, he similarly rescinded a 10% tariff on Brazilian pulp, a key component of paper towels, diapers and toilet paper.— CNBC's Mike Wayland, Annika Kim Constantino, Gabrielle Fonrouge and Amelia Lucas contributed to this report.",

    "body": "Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, is pictured on Sept. 25, 2025, in Berlin.Florian Gaertner | Photothek | Getty ImagesOpenAI is telling investors that it's now targeting roughly $600 billion in total compute spend by 2030, months after CEO Sam Altman touted $1.4 trillion in infrastructure commitments. The artificial intelligence company is providing a lower number and more defined timeline for its planned spending, sources told CNBC, as broader concerns mounted that expansion ambitions were too great for the potential revenue that would follow.OpenAI is projecting that its total revenue for 2030 will be more than $280 billion, with nearly equal contributions from its consumer and enterprise businesses, said the sources, who asked not to be named because the information is private. The spending plan the company is offering is meant to more directly tie to its expected revenue growth, the people said. In the back half of last year, OpenAI announced a flurry of multibillion-dollar infrastructure deals, partnering with leading chipmakers and cloud companies. OpenAI is finalizing a massive funding round that could total more than $100 billion, with about 90% coming from strategic investors, one person said. Nvidia is in discussions to invest up to $30 billion in OpenAI as part of the round that could value the company at a $730 billion pre-money valuation, CNBC has confirmed.In addition to Nvidia, strategic investors in the funding include SoftBank and Amazon. OpenAI generated $13.1 billion in revenue in 2025, the sources said, up from its $10 billion target. The company burned through $8 billion, lower than its $9 billion target, they said. The startup was founded as a nonprofit research lab in 2015, and it rocketed into the mainstream following the launch of its chatbot ChatGPT in 2022. ChatGPT now supports more than 900 million weekly active users, the people said, up from 800 million as of October. OpenAI declared a \"code red\" in December to focus on improving the chatbot in the face of competition from rivals Google and Anthropic. ChatGPT had a dip in growth in the fall, but is back to record highs in both weekly active and daily active users, the people said.The company's coding product, Codex, has surpassed more than 1.5 million weekly active users, the people said. Codex competes directly with Anthropic's Claude Code, which has seen a wave of adoption over the last year.WATCH: Watch CNBC’s full interview with OpenAI CEO Sam Altmanwatch now",

    "body": "U.S. importers will be facing many hurdles trying to recover billions in tariff costs now that the Supreme Court has ruled President Donald Trump's International Emergency Economic Powers Act, or IEEPA, tariffs are illegal.Companies large and small may be eligible for refund payments that in total could reach hundreds of billions of dollars, but trade attorneys have warned that tariff refunds could be denied or delayed, depending on how U.S. courts rule and how the legal system and U.S. Customs and Border Protection go about issuing any eligible payments.Record tariff revenue has been recorded by the U.S. government, with tariff collections surging in January to $30 billion and reaching a year-to-date total of $124 billion. That is up 304% from the same period in 2025.The Supreme Court decision could mean as much as $175 billion sought in refunds, according to estimates, but the ruling was silent on whether tariffs that have been paid under the higher rates will need to be refunded.Read more CNBC coverage on tariffsSupreme Court strikes down Trump tariffs in rebuke of signature policyTrump announces 10% global tariff after raging over Supreme Court lossTrump tariffs: U.S. could owe $175 billion in refundsWhat the Supreme Court tariff ruling may mean for your moneySmall furniture retailers face existential tariff threat, despite Supreme Court rulingU.S. trade deficit totaled $901 billion in 2025, barely budging despite Trump’s tariffsIn his dissent from the majority Supreme Court decision on Friday, Justice Brett Kavanaugh wrote: \"the Court's decision is not likely to greatly restrict Presidential tariff authority going forward. But the Court's decision is likely to generate other serious practical consequences in the near term. One issue will be refunds. Refunds of billions of dollars would have significant consequences for the U. S. Treasury. The Court says nothing today about whether, and if so how, the Government should go about returning the billions of dollars that it has collected from importers. But that process is likely to be a 'mess,' as was acknowledged at oral argument.\"Trump wrote in a social media post back on Jan. 12 that \"it would take many years to figure out what number we are talking about and even, who, when, and where, to pay.\" He added, \"It would be a complete mess, and almost impossible for our Country to pay.\"At a White House press conference on Friday afternoon, Trump raged against the Supreme Court decision and said of paying the refunds, \"I guess it has to get litigated for the next two years. ... We'll end up being in court for the next five years.\" Trump also said he would sign an order to impose a 10% global tariff under Section 122 of the Trade Act of 1974, \"over and above our normal tariffs already being charged. And we're also initiating several section 301, and other investigations to protect our country from unfair trading practices of other countries and companies,\" Trump added, referring to another section of the 1974 act.Lori Mullins, director of operations at Rogers & Brown Custom Brokers, says her initial view of the Supreme Court decision is that it does not grant or guarantee refunds. \"They have remanded this back down to the lower courts to decide if refunds will be issued. Without knowing for certain, many believe that the refunds will not be issued retroactively,\" she said. For importers hoping for refunds, \"the answer is yes, we have a ruling but we do not have a ruling on if any refunds will be granted. That will be handled by a lower court at a future date/time,\" she said.\"Keep in mind also that several countries have also already signed written agreements with specific tariff rates such as the signed agreement with the UK for a flat 15% tariff. This does not impact those already signed agreements so we are not sure, right now, how those country specific agreements will be impacted if at all,\" Mullins added.In the lead-up to the decision, importers and customs experts have been pushing back on claims about refunds being a \"messy\" process, saying that because the tariffs being paid are itemized, the process for refunding the money should be straightforward.The Court of International Trade is typically in charge of refund processes. Trade attorneys do expect the case to be sent back to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, which would presumably then remand the case to the CIT to decide on how to handle refunds.Timothy Keeler, partner and co-head of international trade practice at Mayer Brown and former chief of staff for U.S. Trade Representative Susan Schwab, believes refunds will ultimately be due to companies. \"There will be refunds,\" he said. \"It's just not clear what the process will be to get refunds. It's not clear if companies will have to file in court and become a plaintiff to get refunds, or whether it'll end up being an administrative process,\" handled by U.S. Customs and Border Protection, he said.For starters, the Court of International Trade and litigants who file cases against the tariffs, in coordination with the U.S. government, would need some time to figure out how to manage any refund process. The Department of Justice and the litigants in the tariff cases previously asked the CIT to appoint a steering committee to manage the more than 1,000 refund-related cases filed to date. It's common for a steering committee to be established to manage the tariff repaying process.Even if courts ultimately rule refunds are required, importers betting on a cash infusion from tariff refunds should be aware there's no set timeline and any rush for refunds could overwhelm the system and likely lead to long delays. Joyce Adetutu, international trade lawyer at Vinson & Elkins, said her firm is telling clients it is going to be difficult to issue a broad-scale refund with the \"push of a button.\"\"I don't think that is going to be the scenario here,\" Adetutu said. \"I think what's more likely is that the CIT and the government, Customs, are going to work together to try to allow those who have preserved their claim for a refund to seek that refund ... and those who don't protest will forfeit any refund,\" she added.\"We believe it may take months, if not years, to be decided by the CIT,\" said Greg Tompsett, vice president of customs brokerage USA at logistics company Kuehne + Nagel. \"The extended period of time may also result in additional subsequent lawsuits, which may drive that back to the Supreme Court. So the good news is we do have some finality on the decision. The bad news is there is no immediate action to be taken by any importer to request refunds or to go back after that money,\" he said.Companies will not only be seeking billions in tariff refunds, but billions that are tied up in customs bonds and collateral. Tariffs not only lead to additional import taxes, but by inflating the cost of the products, result in the need for importers to increase the value of customs bonds the government requires them to hold. International trade experts told CNBC that with some tariffs increasing from 10%-25% or more for certain products, importers are facing customs bond amounts that now range from the minimum bond amount by regulation of $50,000 to as high as $450 million. The increase in bond values have left some companies forced to put up additional money in the form of collateral to ensure they could pay the tariffs. The rise in tariffs and related need for bonds and collateral has led to a historic number of \"bond insufficiencies.\" CBP told CNBC it identified more than 24,000 customs bond \"insufficiencies\" valued at nearly $3.6 billion. That's double the 2019 level when insufficiencies first soared due to Trump's first-term tariffs under Section 301 of the 1974 Trade Act.Importers have told CNBC because tariffs are itemized, as are their customs bonds and collateral documentation, in theory they should be able to receive their refunds quickly. However, trade attorneys also say it may be difficult for companies to get any refunds on bond overpayment or collateral quickly because the insurers will want to make sure they are not exposed to any tariff payments.Vincent Moy, international surety leader for Marsh Risk, recently told CNBC that companies should expect some lag time in receiving these customs bond funds due to insurance paperwork requirements. The insurance company will need to verify and audit the paper trail before it releases any collateral.Some sureties have collateral return review procedures that can take 30 to 60 days for them to go back to underwriting to review. Many small and medium-sized businesses were expected to be reaching out to their insurers ahead of the Supreme Court decision to get the process of review started. \"If you are hoping that the collateral will just be returned in due course, the squeaky wheel may make this happen a little bit faster,\" Jennifer Diaz, board-certified international attorney at Diaz Trade Law, recently told CNBC.Democrats on Capitol Hill weren't waiting to press for action from the administration after the court loss. U.S. Sen. Maria Cantwell, D-Wash., ranking member of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation and senior member of the Senate Finance Committee, sent a letter to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent asking for details on administration plans to refund businesses that paid the illegal tariffs.\"Many American businesses, especially small and medium-sized businesses, have struggled to pay these illegal tariffs and, for some, the financial strain has placed them on the brink of bankruptcy,\" wrote Cantwell. \"It is essential Treasury implement an expeditious and transparent process to remediate the financial harm that resulted from these illegal tariffs.\"",

    "body": "Tim Cook, chief executive officer of Apple Inc., during the 60th presidential inauguration in the rotunda of the US Capitol in Washington, DC, US, on Monday, Jan. 20, 2025.Bloomberg | Getty ImagesApple's tariff bill has racked up about $1 billion per quarter, but that number should start shrinking following the Supreme Court decision on tariffs.The Supreme Court on Friday struck down a large chunk of President Donald Trump's far-reaching tariff agenda, delivering a major rebuke of the president's key economic policy. Apple has paid about $3.3 billion in tariffs since Trump initiated them last year. The iPhone maker's shares rose about 1% on Friday.Friday's decision means Apple could start to see lower production costs and keep more of its margins. The company could also face less pressure to move its production away from China and simplify its supply chain.Apple declined to comment.The large tariff costs stem from U.S. import duties on products and components manufactured overseas — especially from China and other Asian partners, like Vietnam and India.When laying out the plan to handle tariffs in May, CEO Tim Cook said Apple is sourcing half of its iPhones for the U.S. from India and most of its other U.S.-bound products like Macs, AirPods and watches from Vietnam, where tariffs were lower than China's at the time. Friday's decision kills Trump's tariffs on China-made goods, which were at a 47% rate as of December. It also frees Apple up to produce more U.S.-bound products in China, where most of its products to non-U.S. countries have been sourced, instead of diverting to India and Vietnam. On earnings calls, Cook has emphasized that Apple is largely absorbing tariff costs to avoid sudden price jumps for customers. watch nowFriday's ruling means the U.S. government could owe more than $175 billion in refunds to importers after the Supreme Court ruled in a 6-3 decision that tariffs unilaterally imposed by Trump are illegal.One big question is whether Apple will fight to claw back its tariffs or eat the costs to avoid angering the president.Addressing the SCOTUS decision in a press conference Friday afternoon, Trump did not commit to refunding U.S. companies that paid the tariffs and said he expects multi-year \"litigation\" over paying back the money.The tariffs have tested the relationship between the commander-in-chief and the chief executive of one of the world's most valuable companies.The once-solid relationship between Trump and Cook began breaking down over the idea of a U.S.-made iPhone. In May, Trump said he \"had a little problem with Tim Cook,\" and threatened to slap a 25% tariff on iPhones.Cook went on the charm offensive.In August, he appeared at the White House with Trump to announce plans to spend about $600 billion over four years in the U.S. Apple also committed to purchasing parts and expanding its relationship with U.S. suppliers. Cook presented Trump with a custom, engraved glass plaque featuring a 24-karat gold base.Last month, Cook attended the White House screening of the \"Melania\" documentary about first lady Melania Trump.watch nowDespite Friday's ruling, tariffs are still a moving target, leaving many questions about the impact on companies like Apple.Hours after the Supreme Court struck down his reciprocal tariffs, the president said he will sign an executive order imposing a new 10% \"global tariff,\" which he's invoking under Section 122 of the Trade Act of 1974. Tariffs using that statute can only last for 150 days, with any extension requiring congressional approval. The administration is also wielding Section 301 to launch several investigations into potentially unfair trade practices, which could result in additional new tariffs, the president said.CNBC's Steve Kovach contributed to this report. Read more CNBC tech newsTesla loses bid to toss $243 million verdict in fatal Autopilot crash suitMeta and Apple face serious questions about child safety and privacyFrom 'vanlords' to safe parking sites: How RVs became Silicon Valley's housing safety netWho's laughing now?

    "body": "watch nowThe gap is widening between rival toy makers Hasbro and Mattel — thanks in part to a 30-year-old trading card game. The toy giants have flip-flopped dominance in the space for decades, jockeying for the most coveted master licenses to put new fan favorites — Disney princesses and \"Star Wars\" characters among them — on store shelves. But as the industry recovers from a period of declining sales, Hasbro is the one winning over Wall Street.For the fiscal year 2025, Hasbro reported revenue gains of 14%, reaching $4.7 billion, while Mattel saw its net sales drop 1% to $5.3 billion.Though Mattel's revenue is larger than Hasbro's, its growth has been stagnating, according to Eric Handler, managing director and senior research analyst at Roth Capital Partners.\"[Mattel's] revenue has been in a very tight range for five years now, and 2026, on an organic basis, is the same,\" he told CNBC.Mattel shares are down more than 20% in the last 12 months, trading at around $17. Meanwhile, Hasbro's stock is up roughly 46% over the same period, with shares trading at around $100.Of course, Hasbro's journey post-pandemic has not been without its own headwinds. The company's revenue took a hit when it divested its film and TV business, eOne. Also, its entertainment segment, which includes film and TV licenses, was deeply impacted by Hollywood's dual labor strikes in 2023.\"Despite market volatility and a shifting consumer environment, we returned this company to growth in a meaningful way,\" Hasbro CEO Chris Cocks told investors during an earnings call earlier this month.Throughout these changes, one key piece of Hasbro's business has been steadily growing — Wizards of the Coast.A dash of MagicThe Hasbro division includes Dungeons & Dragons, Magic: The Gathering and the company's portfolio of digital and video games. In 2025, Wizards' revenue grew 45% to $2.1 billion, fueled by sales of sets tied to Magic's Universe Beyond and smaller, limited-edition Secret Lair packs — some that sell for close to $200. While the segment accounts for less than half of the company's revenue, it represents 88% of its adjusted profits.Magic: The Gathering playing cards form a light fixture at the Wizards of the Coast headquarters in Renton, Washington, Sept. 11, 2025. With traditional toy and game sales lagging, Hasbro has found a growth engine in role-playing games such as Dungeons and Dragons, trading card games like Magic: The Gathering and a growing portfolio of digital and video games.Bloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesThe strategic trading card game Magic, which was created in 1993, typically features two players going head-to-head using custom decks of collectible cards to cast spells, unleash creatures or use artifacts to defeat their opponent.In the last five years, Hasbro has expanded beyond the lore of the initial game to launch card sets based on intellectual property from third parties, including \"Avatar: The Last Airbender,\" Marvel's \"Spider-Man\" and \"Lord of the Rings.\"These sets are not only popular with long-standing Magic fans, but act as a gateway for consumers from other fanbases into the world of Magic. In mid-2025, Hasbro released a \"Final Fantasy\" set that became the fastest-selling expansion pack in Magic: The Gathering history, generating $200 million in sales in a single day.  \"They have done a fantastic job of widening the funnel in the last couple years, and it's become a multigenerational type of product,\" Handler said. \"The player base is growing. It's a sticky player base that is showing eagerness with new products and new ways to play.\"Through the end of 2025, more than 1 million unique players participated in organized play — meaning sanctioned tournaments — according to Cocks. That's a 22% year-over-year increase, he said.Additionally, the number of game stores that host events, called the Wizards Play Network, has grown to more than 10,000, a 20% increase from 2024.\"Taken together, this reinforces our confidence in Magic's long-term growth,\" Cocks said on the company's earnings call. \"We are building a system of play with multiple entry points, product types, and engagement paths, and that system is positioned to continue driving growth into 2026 and beyond.\"In 2026, Hasbro plans to launch new Magic sets based on \"The Hobbit,\" \"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles\" and \"Star Trek.\"The company has forecast mid-single-digit growth for its Wizards business in 2026, but Keegan Cox, associate vice president and research analyst at D.A. Davidson, in a research note published shortly after the company's earnings, called that estimate \"conservative.\" The digital frontierHasbro's Wizards unit also includes the digital and licensed gaming space, which saw revenues jump 6% in 2025, fueled by the success of \"Monopoly Go!\" Cocks has previously noted that modern consumers and modern play is increasingly moving into online forums, and the company has launched new games and an in-person video game studio in Montreal to boost play. While Hasbro's digital gaming division is growing, Mattel is just getting its own digital unit off the ground. Earlier this month, Mattel announced it would buy out partner NetEase from its 50% stake in their Mattel163 joint venture, taking full ownership of the business. Mattel163 develops digital games based on the toy company's brands and since 2018 has launched four digital games: Uno, Uno Wonder, Phase 10 and Skip-Bo. \"In our view, [Mattel] is in the early stages of an investment similar to Hasbro's investment in gaming over 7 years ago,\" D.A. Davidson's Cox wrote. \"While we do not think [Mattel] will be chasing to compete with Hasbro ... we do believe [Mattel] can make successful mobile games tied to their IP and should add to profit margins over time.\"An industry in fluxMattel's push into digital comes as two of its flagship brands struggle to make sales. \"Barbie's been on a meaningful decline, as has Fisher-Price,\" Handler noted. \"That's sort of been negating a lot of the good news that's been happening with Hot Wheels.\" The vehicles division saw gross billings jump 11% in 2025, while the dolls segment fell 7% and the infant, toddler and preschool space slipped 17%.That segment for the youngest consumers has been in decline for over a decade, the result of shrinking population growth and the fact that children are being introduced to electronics earlier in their development. Shifting play habits have meant toy makers have to adapt, and fast. But there's hope for Mattel and the toy industry as a whole. In 2025, total annual dollar sales were up 6% in the U.S., according to data from Circana. And, perhaps more importantly, the number of units sold increased 3%, quelling fears that price-conscious consumers are pulling back on toy purchases.\"Unit sales being up, I think, is the most important metric we can look at,\" said James Zahn, senior editor of The Toy Insider and The Toy Book. \"If unit sales were down, that's when you know people are really buying less, and that didn't happen.\"Mattel and Hasbro, alongside other toy companies, are also expected to get a boost from a robust theatrical calendar this year.Mattel has two of its own brands being represented at the box office with \"Masters of the Universe\" coming in June and \"Matchbox\" arriving in October. While Mattel won't see a major bump from ticket sales, its toy sales could get a boost. After all, the 2023 release of \"Barbie\" helped fuel a 16% increase in gross billings of the doll in the quarter after it hit cinemas.Mattel also holds the master toy licenses for \"Toy Story\" and Disney princesses, meaning it'll handle the bulk of the product for \"Toy Story 5\" and the live-action \"Moana.\"Hasbro will have toy lines for \"The Mandalorian and Grogu,\" \"Spider-Man: Brand New Day\" and \"Avengers: Doomsday.\"Together, Mattel and Hasbro have also collaborated on the much anticipated product line for Netflix's hit animated film \"KPop Demon Hunters,\" promising dolls, foam roleplay items, games and plush items.\"'KPop Demon Hunters' is gonna do big business for both Hasbro and Mattel,\" Zahn said.",

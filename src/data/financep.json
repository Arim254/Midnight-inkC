    "body": "A Netflix building in Hollywood, California, Dec. 17, 2025.Zeng Hui | Xinhua News Agency | Getty ImagesNetflix has adjusted its offer for Warner Bros. Discovery's studio and streaming assets to an all-cash bid, according to an SEC filing Tuesday. Netflix now plans to pay $27.75 per WBD share entirely in cash to acquire WBD's streaming platform HBO Max and the Warner Bros. film studio. The two companies initially reached a deal in December, composed of a combination of cash and stock at an equity value of $72 billion. \"The WBD Board continues to support and unanimously recommend our transaction, and we are confident that it will deliver the best outcome for stockholders, consumers, creators and the broader entertainment community,\" said Ted Sarandos, co-CEO of Netflix, said in a release on Tuesday. \"Our revised all-cash agreement will enable an expedited timeline to a stockholder vote and provide greater financial certainty at $27.75 per share in cash, plus the value from the planned separation of Discovery Global,\" Sarandos said in the release.CNBC's David Faber and other media outlets reported last week that Netflix was likely to make the adjustment as Paramount Skydance continues to build up pressure in its hostile takeover attempt for the entirety of WBD, which also includes cable TV networks such as CNN and TNT. With the offer amendment, the timeline for shareholder approval could shift to as early as late February or early March, Faber reported last week, citing sources familiar with the matter. Previously, shareholders were expected to vote on the deal in the spring or early summer.WBD's board unanimously accepted the amended Netflix offer, according to Tuesday's filing. The board has twice recommended that shareholders reject Paramount's hostile bid in favor of the Netflix transaction. Paramount recently sued for information in its hostile pursuit of WBD and has also launched a proxy fight, informing WBD shareholders that it intends to nominate directors for election to the Warner Bros. Discovery board at the company's annual 2026 meeting. On Tuesday WBD also filed a preliminary proxy statement seeking shareholder approval for its deal with Netflix. If the deal were to be approved, WBD's cable TV networks would be spun off into a new, publicly traded entity known as Discovery Global. If the deal were to be approved, the separation is expected to be completed in six to nine months, prior to the closing of the transaction between Netflix and WBD. Netflix reports earnings after the bell Tuesday, and investors will be looking for further updates on the sale process.",

    "body": "watch nowAmazon CEO Andy Jassy said President Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs are starting to be reflected in the price of some items, as sellers weigh how to absorb the shock of the added costs.Amazon and many of its third-party merchants pre-purchased inventory to try to get ahead of the tariffs and keep prices low for customers, but most of that supply ran out last fall, Jassy said in a Tuesday interview with CNBC's Becky Quick at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. \"So you start to see some of the tariffs creep into some of the prices, some of the items, and you see some sellers are deciding that they're passing on those higher costs to consumers in the form of higher prices, some are deciding that they'll absorb it to drive demand and some are doing something in between,\" Jassy said. \"I think you're starting to see more of that impact.\" The comments are a notable shift from last year, when Jassy said Amazon hadn't seen \"prices appreciably go up\" a few months after Trump announced wide-ranging tariffs. Last April, Jassy also predicted that some sellers may be forced to pass the added cost of the tariffs on to consumers because some businesses \"don't have 50% extra margin that you can play with.\" Read more CNBC tech newsMeta's VR layoffs, studio closures underscore Zuckerberg's massive pivot to AIBig Tech is looking to energy talent to fuel its AI ambitionsPalantir is trying to 'destroy' Percepta through legal action, startup's execs say in filingMicrosoft says communities won't see energy price hikes near data centers as utility costs riseAmazon sellers previously told CNBC they were considering or had already raised the price of some items due to higher import costs in the wake of the tariffs. A major retail trade association warned last August that the trade war would loom over companies' inventory ordering plans this Spring, which could lead to higher prices, fewer products on the shelves and job losses.  Amazon is trying to \"keep prices as low as possible\" for consumers, but in some cases, price hikes may be unavoidable, Jassy said Tuesday.\"At a certain point, because retail is, as you know, a mid-single digit operating margin business, if people's costs go up by 10%, there aren't a lot of places to absorb it,\" Jassy said. \"You don't have endless options,\" he added.Consumers remain \"pretty resilient\" and are still spending amid the tariffs, Jassy said. But they have impacted some shoppers' purchasing habits, with Amazon observing some people trading down to lower priced items and bargain hunting, while others are holding off from buying higher-priced discretionary products, he said.watch now",

The Dow Jones Industrial Average slid more than 700 points, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite each dropped more than 1%.The latest flare-up in so-called sell America positioning follows Trump's threats to impose 10% tariffs on eight European countries as part of his push to take over Greenland.

Following Trump's latest threats, some investors worry that European countries could dump U.S. assets in a show of power.\"On the other side of trade, deficits, and trade wars, there are capital and capital wars,\" Bridgewater Associates founder Ray Dalio told CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. \"If you take the conflicts, you can't ignore the possibility of the capital wars.

    "body": "Sarah Friar, CFO of OpenAI, appears on CNBC's Squawk Box on August 20, 2025. CNBCOpenAI will make 2026 its year of \"practical adoption,\" the artificial intelligence startup's finance chief said in a blog Sunday. \"The priority is closing the gap between what AI now makes possible and how people, companies, and countries are using it day to day,\" OpenAI CFO Sarah Friar wrote. \"The opportunity is large and immediate, especially in health, science, and enterprise, where better intelligence translates directly into better outcomes.\"In the blog, Friar laid out how OpenAI views its strategy for driving monetization of its services, like ChatGPT, while securing the compute necessary to power those products, saying that the AI lab's revenue directly tracks with the availability of its technical infrastructure. OpenAI's compute grew from 0.2 gigawatts in 2023 to about 1.9 GW in 2025, while the company's annual revenue run rate grew similarly from $2 billion in 2023 to more than $20 billion last year, Friar said. \"This is never-before-seen growth at such scale,\" she wrote. \"And we firmly believe that more compute in these periods would have led to faster customer adoption and monetization.\"Friar's blog comes as OpenAI and the tech industry's focus on AI comes under scrutiny for the massive investments necessary to build out the data centers and secure the energy and components required to power this cutting-edge technology that has yet to deliver much revenue returns for investors. Among those key deals is an agreement between OpenAI and AI chipmaker Nvidia announced in September. Under that agreement, Nvidia said it would commit $100 billion to support the AI startup as it builds and deploys at least 10 GW of Nvidia's systems.A gigawatt is a measure of power, and 10 GW is roughly equivalent to the annual power consumption of 8 million U.S. households, according to a CNBC analysis of data from the Energy Information Administration.But in November, Nvidia told investors there was \"no assurance\" that its agreement with OpenAI would progress beyond an announcement and to an official contract stage. \"Securing world-class compute requires commitments made years in advance, and growth does not move in a perfectly smooth line,\" wrote Friar, adding that the system requires discipline. Three years ago, OpenAI relied on a single compute provider, but now it works with a diversified ecosystem, Friar said. \"We can plan, finance, and deploy capacity with confidence in a market where access to compute defines who can scale,\" she wrote. OpenAI's business model should scale with its services, Friar said. \"As intelligence moves into scientific research, drug discovery, energy systems, and financial modeling, new economic models will emerge,\" she wrote. The blog comes after OpenAI last week said that it planned to begin testing ads for some ChatGPT users in the U.S. That move comes as OpenAI gears up for a potential public debut this year. \"Monetization should feel native to the experience,\" Friar wrote. \"If it does not add value, it does not belong.\"WATCH: OpenAI Investor Letter: Weekly and daily active user figures 'continue to produce all-time highs'watch now",

(Photo by Press Information Bureau (PIB)/Anadolu via Getty Images)Anadolu | Anadolu | Getty ImagesIndia said it plans to double bilateral trade with the UAE to $200 billion by 2032, in a step toward diversifying its partnerships as a deal with the Asian country's biggest trading partner, the U.S., remains elusive.In a whirlwind, three-hour long meeting late Monday between UAE's President Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in New Delhi, both countries' state-owned companies signed a 10-year liquefied natural gas supply agreement. Under the deal, the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company, which is owned by the Abu Dhabi government, will supply LNG worth up to $3 billion for a period of 10 years, starting 2028, to India's state-owned Hindustan Petroleum Corporation. With this deal, India is now UAE's largest customer of LNG and will account for 20% of sales by 2029, ADNOC said in a release.Both countries also discussed \"a wide range of issues aimed at further strengthening the multifaceted India-UAE friendship,\" Prime Minister Modi said in a post on X.\"It was a productive visit in terms of outcome,\" said Harsh Pant, vice president for studies and foreign policy at New Delhi-based think tank Observer Research Foundation told CNBC's Inside India.He added that India-UAE ties have evolved to a point where \"regular high-level interaction at relatively short notice is going to become more common\".Trade between India and UAE touched $100 billion in fiscal year 2025. Both countries signed the Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement in 2022.India is the Middle Eastern country's second-largest trading partner, accounting for nearly 9% of its total trade and 14% of non-oil exports as of September 2025, according to India Brand Equity Foundation, an initiative backed by the commerce ministry. UAE was India's third largest trading partner after the U.S. and China in fiscal year 2025, and is home to 3.5 million Indian expatriates.Diversifying alliesIndia's plan to expand its trade with UAE comes at a time when the country's exports to the U.S. are under pressure owing to the 50% tariff imposed by Washington on Indian goods since August last year.\"Even with a trade deal [with the U.S.] there is no guarantee that President Trump's \"unpredictability would end,\" said Pant, adding that it is the reason that India has been reaching out to finalise trade deal with other countries.Last year, following the U.S. tariffs, India entered trade pacts with the UK and Oman, and said it will sign a deal with New Zealand in the first half of 2026.",

Kevin Lamarque | ReutersU.S. President Donald Trump has taken aim at another NATO ally on the eve of his appearance at the World Economic Forum in Davos this week, this time lambasting the U.K.The so-called \"special relationship\" between the U.S. and U.K., and President Donald Trump and Prime Minister Keir Starmer, was left looking bruised on Tuesday after Trump posted a tirade against London's decision to hand sovereignty of the Chagos Islands to Mauritius.The islands include Diego Garcia where a joint U.K.-U.S. military base is stationed. The deal, which was agreed in May 2025, saw the British government agree to hand sovereignty to Mauritius, but to lease the military base on Diego Garcia for £101 million ($135.7 million) a year. The White House voiced its support for the deal last year but, on Tuesday, Trump said it was \"an act of great stupidity.\"\"Shockingly, our \"brilliant\" NATO Ally, the United Kingdom, is currently planning to give away the Island of Diego Garcia, the site of a vital U.S. Military Base, to Mauritius, and to do so FOR NO REASON WHATSOEVER,\" Trump posted on social media platform Truth Social early Tuesday.The president said China and Russia would view this act as one of \"total weakness,\" and that they were international powers that only recognized strength. \"The U.K. giving away extremely important land is an act of GREAT STUPIDITY, and is another in a very long line of National Security reasons why Greenland has to be acquired.\"He added that Denmark and its European allies, who oppose Trump's takeover bid, had to \"do the right thing.\"Responding to Trump's comments, a U.K. government spokesman said Tuesday that \"the U.K. will never compromise on our national security.\"\"We acted because the base on Diego Garcia was under threat after court decisions undermined our position and would have prevented it operating as intended in future,\" he added, according to comments published by BBC News.Rift among alliesTrump's comments come amid a growing rift between the U.S. and its European NATO allies, including the U.K. and France, over the president's incessant pursuit of Greenland, a Danish territory in the Arctic.Greenland, Denmark, and European leaders have said the island is not for sale, but Trump has not ruled out using military force to seize the territory if necessary. He has also threatened eight European NATO allies with escalating tariffs if they continue to block his takeover bid.The U.K. is the second NATO ally to be lambasted by Trump in as many days, with the president threatening to impose 200% tariffs on French wines and Champagne on Monday after French President Emmanuel Macron reportedly turned down a seat on Trump's \"Board of Peace\" for Gaza.The U.K. has tried to defuse tensions between the U.S. and Europe, calling for cool heads and further discussions over Greenland.In a press conference Monday, Starmer said that Britain greatly values its long-standing special relationship with the U.S., but that only Greenland and Denmark can decide the island's future.People bear Greenlandic flags as they gather in front of the U.S. consulate  protest against U.S. President Donald Trump and his announced intent to acquire Greenland on January 17, 2026 in Nuuk, Greenland. Sean Gallup | Getty Images News | Getty Images\"On Greenland, the right way to approach an issue of this seriousness is through calm discussion between allies,\" Starmer said at a press conference in Downing Street, the PM's official residence.\"But there is a principle here that cannot be set aside, because it goes to the heart of how stable and trusted international cooperation works, so any decision about the future status of Greenland belongs to the people of Greenland and the Kingdom of Denmark alone,\" he added.Starmer spoke to Trump on Sunday night, telling him he was wrong to threaten to impose fresh tariffs on NATO allies if they didn't agree to his demands to \"buy\" Greenland.Starmer and Trump have always seemed to enjoy a warm and respectful relationship, despite their political differences.The U.K. was the first country to strike a trade deal with Washington last year, largely owing to Trump's apparent warmth toward the country. The U.S. president enjoyed all the pomp and pageantry the U.K. could muster during a state visit last fall.",

    "body": "Snow plows work to clear Interstate 235 John MacVicar Freeway in Des Moines, Iowa, on Jan. 12, 2024.Chip Somodevilla | Getty ImagesNatural gas prices soared Tuesday, as heating demand is expected to spike due to a blast of frigid weather across the U.S. Prices surged 25%, or 78 cents, to $3.89 per million British thermal units by 10 a.m. ET,  putting natural gas futures on pace for the best day in four years. Natural gas is used primarily for heating and electricity generation.\"Frigid weather is set to reshape the near-term natural gas outlook as Arctic air masses flash across the eastern US and the huge weather demand gain over the MLK weekend threatens severe market dislocation,\" EBW Analytics told clients in a Tuesday note. A big winter storm is forecast to dump heavy snow, sleet and treacherous freezing rain across the southern Rockies, the Plains and the South by Friday, according to the National Weather Service. The storm is then expected to shift toward the East Coast through the weekend. Much of the U.S. was already gripped by frigid temperatures Tuesday morning. The weather will threaten production freeze-offs, according to EBW Analytics. \"The frigid weather pivot comes with speculator short positions at a 14-month high — suggesting further bullish risks as shorts are forced to buy back gas,\" the group told clients. \"Volatility will stay high, however — and any weather model warming into mid-February could allow a near term price spike to eventually soften,\" the group said.

    "body": "Sanae Takaichi, Japan's prime minister, during a news conference the prime minister's office in Tokyo, Japan, on Monday, Jan. 19, 2026. Takaichi officially called an early election next month and promised a temporary sales tax cut on food if she wins a fresh mandate for her new coalition. Bloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesLess than half a year into office and Japan's new prime minister, Sanae Takaichi, has called a snap election, dissolving the Lower House on Jan. 23 and sending voters to the polls on Feb. 8. \"I am putting my future as prime minister on this election,\" Takaichi said at a press conference Monday, according to a Google translation of her remarks in Japanese.\"I would like the people to make a direct decision on whether they can entrust the management of the nation to Sanae Takaichi.\"The move comes despite the Lower House's term running until October 2028, raising questions over why Takaichi chose to seek a fresh mandate so early.Analysts say the decision is largely aimed at capitalizing on Takichi's high approval ratings to strengthen the ruling Liberal Democratic Party and its coalition hold on parliament. While [Sanae Takaichi] is an extremely popular Prime Minister, her party is less popular and faces a united opposition following a surprise partnership between the main opposition party and the former LDP coalition partner.Sam JochimEconomist at Swiss private bank EFGTakaichi has enjoyed historically high approval ratings since taking office. Her approval rating stood at 62% in a survey published last week by public broadcaster NHK, while other polls have placed her support in the 70% range.A Japan News Network poll showed an approval rating of as high as 78.1%, while Nikkei reported 75%. By contrast, the LDP's approval rating is at 29.7%, highlighting a gap between support for the prime minister and her party.The LDP, along with its junior coalition partner, the Japan Innovation Party, currently holds a razor-thin majority in the Lower House. Both parties have a combined total of 230 seats in the 456-seat chamber, but 3 independents vote with the LDP, giving the ruling coalition a 1-seat majority. A stronger majority would allow Takaichi to project a firmer political mandate to foreign leaders, including U.S. President Donald Trump, said Sam Jochim, economist at Swiss private bank EFG. He noted that Takaichi could have a potential meeting with the U.S. president as early as March. Jochim added that Takaichi will be aiming to capitalize on her popularity before escalating tensions with China begin to weigh on public sentiment.Beijing has imposed export controls on dual-use items to Japan and advised its citizens against travel to Japan. Diplomatic relations cooled after Takaichi said in parliament on Nov. 8 that a Chinese attempt to seize Taiwan by force could prompt Japan's Self-Defense Forces to intervene. Calculated or reckless?Despite Takaichi's popularity, analysts warn that voter support may not translate to gains for the LDP. Jochim said that Takaichi was \"taking a risk\" by calling this election, pointing out that \"while she is an extremely popular Prime Minister, her party is less popular and faces a united opposition following a surprise partnership between the main opposition party and the former LDP coalition partner.\"On Jan. 16, the Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan, the largest opposition party, joined with Komeito — the LDP's former coalition partner for 26 years — to create a new party called the \"Centrist Reform Alliance.\" Together, they control 172 seats in the Lower House. Norihiro Yamaguchi, lead Japan Economist at Oxford Economics, said that without Komeito's organizational support, a considerable number of LDP candidates could struggle at the ballot box.Other analysts are more optimistic. Jesper Koll, expert director at Monex Group, said Takaichi was an \"inspiration\" to both old and particularly young Japanese. Her personal appeal, rather than her economic policies, may prove decisive and drive a landslide victory, he said.\"Takaichi is the living example of a self-made woman rising to the top against all the odds — self-made, a normal working-class family background, neither money nor Brahman,\" Koll said. \"But hard work, dedication, passion, and willingness to do what is right.\"",

Alexander Drago | ReutersU.S. President Donald Trump on Tuesday threatened to impose 200% tariffs on French wines and champagne after French President Emmanuel Macron was reported to be unwilling to join his \"Board of Peace\" on Gaza.When asked for a response by a reporter in Miami about Macron's stance, Trump dismissed the French leader's influence and said he would use trade penalties as leverage.\"Well, nobody wants him because he's going to be out of office very soon,\" Trump said. \"So you know, that's all right. What I'll do is, if they feel like [being] hostile, I'll put a 200% tariff on his wines and champagnes, and he'll join. But he doesn't have to join.\"Macron's five-year presidential term is due to end in May 2027, and under French law, he cannot run again for a third term.The Board of Peace is a global body endorsed by the United Nations Security Council in November last year, established to oversee the Israel-Hamas ceasefire.Invites to various world leaders to be on the board have been sent, including to Russian President Vladimir Putin, UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Trump also reiterated his plans to control Greenland, downplaying the likelihood of resistance from Europe.\"I don't think they're going to push back too much,\" he said. \"We have to have it ...They can't protect it.\"Referring to Denmark's historical claims over Greenland, Trump said the Danish leaders were \"very good people,\" but argued that a centuries-old presence did not confer ownership.\"[Just] because the boat went there 500 years ago and then left, that doesn't give you title to property.\" It was not clear what \"boat\" Trump was referring to. Denmark has held colonies in Greenland since 1721, and the island was made part of Denmark in 1953. In 2009, Denmark granted Greenland self-government, giving the territory control over all its affairs except foreign policy and defence.Trump on Friday threatened to take control of Greenland \"whether they [European lawmakers] like it or not,\" claiming that it was needed for \"world security.\"On Saturday, he also warned that the U.S. would impose tariffs of up to 25% on eight European countries, including the UK, until the U.S. controls Greenland. Trump has not ruled out the use of military force to seize the territory, though Secretary of State Marco Rubio reportedly said on Jan. 6 that Trump would prefer to buy Greenland.In response, European states are weighing retaliatory tariffs and broader punitive economic counter-measures against the U.S.",

    "body": "watch nowBillionaire investor Ray Dalio warned Tuesday that President Donald Trump's aggressive political direction could spark a new phase of global financial conflict, as foreign governments and investors reconsider their appetite for U.S. assets amid rising unease and economic tensions.\"On the other side of trade deficits and trade wars, there are capital and capital wars,\" Dalio told CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. \"If you take the conflicts, you can't ignore the possibility of the capital wars. In other words, maybe there's not the same inclination to buy at U.S. debt and so on.\"The founder of Bridgewater Associates, one of the world's largest hedge funds, is concerned that countries holding large amounts of U.S. dollars and Treasurys may become less willing to finance U.S. deficits if trust erodes. At the same time, the U.S. continues to issue large volumes of debt, creating a problematic situation if confidence weakens on either side, Dalio said.\"We know that both the holders of U.S. dollars are denominated ... and those who need it, the United States, are worried about each other. Right? So if you have other countries who are holding it, and they're worried about each other, and we're producing a lot of it, that's a big issue,\" he said.Treasury prices tumbled Tuesday as investors weighed renewed tariff threats from Washington that revived fears of a trade war with Europe and spurred a flight away from U.S. assets. The president has intensified his rhetoric on Greenland, threatening to impose new tariffs on countries opposing the sale of the Danish territory to the United States. Dalio said history offers multiple examples of similar episodes in which economic conflict escalated beyond trade into capital flows and currency disputes.\"When you have conflicts, international geopolitical conflicts, even allies do not want to hold each other's debt. They prefer to go to a hard currency. This is logical and it's factual, and it's repeated throughout the world history,\" he said.Dalio reiterated the importance of diversification, arguing that investors should not rely too heavily on any single asset class or country. He highlighted gold as a key hedge in periods of financial stress, recommending it make up between 5% and 15% of a typical portfolio.\"It does very well when other assets don't do well,\" Dalio said. \"It is an effective diversifier.\"Spot gold rose to an all-time high of $4,689.39 on Tuesday as investors flocked to safe-haven assets on intensifying tensions.",

Nvidia and Tesla each fell nearly 3%, while Meta Platforms, Alphabet, Apple, Microsoft and Amazon all lost more than 1%.Those moves put pressure on the broader market. The Nasdaq Composite was last trading 1.3% lower, lagging the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average which were respectively down 1.1% and 0.9%.Markets were rattled after Trump threatened new tariffs on countries opposing the sale of Greenland to the United States, saying in a Truth Social post that levies could begin at 10% in February and rise to 25% by June. The president also floated steep tariffs on French goods and criticized European allies, fueling concerns about a wider trade escalation between the U.S. and the European Union.The renewed trade tensions come as global leaders gather at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, this week, with investors watching closely for signs that negotiations could cool tensions. But Wedbush analyst Dan Ives isn't overly concerned. \"Tech stocks will be hit as the 'risk off dynamic' hits AI names front and center but ultimately we view this as an opportunity to own the tech winners for 2026 and beyond,\" Ives wrote. \"The back and forth war of words between Trump and the EU will give investors another opportunity to own the tech winners and despite the bears always trying to yell fire in a crowded theater. ... the AI Revolution is still in the early days of playing out and this soap opera this week is not changing that dynamic in our view as the 4th Industrial Revolution hits its next stage of growth in 2026.\"Ives added that an upcoming catalyst could be a \"robust\" fourth-quarter earnings season expected from tech stalwarts over the next few weeks, with around $550 billion in capital expenditures fueling the next stage of the AI revolution. He listed stocks such as Nvidia, Microsoft, Palantir, CrowdStrike, Nebius, Apple, Palo Alto, Google and Tesla as names he would buy amid current market weakness.",

    "body": "watch nowAfter months of speculation and political intrigue, President Donald Trump is close to nominating the next chair of the Federal Reserve, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Tuesday.The president has whittled down the field to four candidates to succeed current Chair Jerome Powell and a decision is forthcoming, Bessent told CNBC during an interview at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.\"My guess is the president will reach a decision maybe as soon as next week,\" he said during the \"Squawk Box\" interview. \"We've had substantial conversations about this. We've run a process that started in September — 11 very strong candidates. We're now down to four candidates. The president has personally met with all of them, and it's going to be his decision.\"Bessent did not name the four finalists, though previous comments have indicated a field of five that included National Economic Council director Kevin Hassett, former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh, current Governors Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman and BlackRock's chief fixed income strategist, Rick Rieder.Prediction markets have honed in on Hassett, Warsh and Waller, though White House officials have said Rieder also met with Trump, and he has gotten more interest. Recently, Warsh has become the front-runner on Kalshi, with Rieder and Waller trailing, following comments from Trump that he'd prefer Hassett stay in his current role.Bessent has run the screening process but did not indicate a personal preference. White House officials including Trump and the Treasury secretary have regularly criticized Powell both for his stewardship of monetary policy and setting of interest rates, as well as the way he has run the institution in general. Recent developments have seen the Justice Department subpoena Powell relating to the renovation project at Fed headquarters.Trump nominated Powell for the position in 2017, and former President Joe Biden reappointed him.\"Look, I think the Fed's monetary policy independence is very important. I think that a lot of the issues around the independence are being created by the other things that are happening,\" Bessent said. \"Under Chair Powell's watch, we will have seen between four to six governors and presidents have to resign for ethical issues. That's out of 19. If that happened at a Wall Street firm, the CEO would be out.\"Multiple Fed officials, and most recently Governor Adriana Kugler, either have retired or resigned after running afoul of ethics guidelines on investing. \"The independence does not mean lack of accountability. The Fed has a special obligation to the American people because it influences their lives,\" Bessent said.Though Powell's chair term runs out in May, he will have the option to stay on as governor until 2028.

Etienne Laurent | AFP | Getty ImagesDETROIT — Five years after the transatlantic automaker Stellantis was formed through a merger, the business hasn't necessarily panned out as investors hoped.U.S. shares of the company — created through a $52 billion combination of Italian American automaker Fiat Chrysler and France-based Groupe PSA on Jan. 16, 2021 — are down roughly 43% in the past five years. Italian-listed shares also are off roughly 40%.Since the combined company's stock debuted on the New York Stock Exchange on Jan. 19, 2021, days after the merger was completed, shares of the automaker were largely in the black — up as high as 74% in March 2024 — until Stellantis reported troubling financial results that year amid cost-cutting efforts meant to support higher profits and its multibillion-dollar push into electric vehicles.Many of those plans are being altered or eliminated under new Stellantis CEO Antonio Filosa, who succeeded Carlos Tavares last summer. Tavares, a longtime automotive executive, was largely credited with forming the company, but abruptly left Stellantis in December 2024.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconStellantis shares listed in the U.S. and Italy.Filosa is executing a sales turnaround plan for the automaker and is particularly focused on its Jeep and Ram brands regaining U.S. market share following yearslong sales declines.\"The strategy that we have in front of us is a strong one and will lead us to growth if we execute well,\" he told reporters Wednesday during the Detroit Auto Show. \"So, I believe it's a year of execution.\"Filosa did not rule out the possibility of regionally refocusing or shrinking the company's vast portfolio of brands that also includes Italian nameplates Fiat and Alfa Romeo, which have not performed well domestically.He said he believes the company should \"stay together\" following some speculation, including from Tavares, that it would be better to sell off assets or brands.Filosa said the next step in the company's plans will come during a meeting this month with more than 200 company executives that will focus on an upcoming capital markets day as well as company culture and 2026 execution.PSA CEO Carlos Tavares and FCA CEO Mike Manley shake hands after signing a combination agreement that will lead to the creation of the world's fourth-largest global automaker in terms of annual sales (8.7 million vehicles).FCAInvestors have been eager to hear a new strategy for Stellantis after Tavares' exit. He left amid troubling sales and financial results as the company strived to achieve 10% or greater profit margins and doubling net revenues under his \"Dare Forward 2030\" business plan.U.S. shares of Stellantis since Filosa began as CEO on June 23 are up 2%. They closed Friday at $9.60 per share, down 4.2%. Filosa this week declined to discuss the company's past mistakes, but company executives previously told CNBC that Tavares' fixation on cost reductions and profits hurt business, as well as the company's products, employees and relationships with suppliers, unions and dealers.Filosa has spent much of his time attempting to repair those bonds, especially with the company's distraught U.S. franchised retailers. He's also approved drastic changes to the company's product plans, including reducing prices and reprioritizing products away from electrified vehicles.\"In the six months, I see the changes that we will make we need to make to create the bright future that we need,\" he said regarding his tenure thus far as CEO.

The Danish Defense will continue the increased presence with exercise activities together with a number of NATO allies in and around Greenland in 2026.Mads Claus Rasmussen | Afp | Getty ImagesU.S. President Donald Trump has dismissed the prospect of the European Union resisting his push to annex Greenland \"too much,\" shortly after Denmark sent additional troops to the Arctic island.Speaking ahead of his trip to Davos for the World Economic Forum, Trump repeated his desire to take the self-governing Danish territory. The issue has ratcheted up trans-Atlantic tensions and rattled the NATO military alliance.\"I don't think they are going to push back too much,\" Trump told reporters in Florida on Monday evening, referring to EU opposition over Greenland. \"Look, we have to have it,\" he added.The U.S. president, who has long coveted making Greenland a part of the U.S., reiterated his interest in the sparsely populated territory following an audacious military intervention in Venezuela on Jan. 3.Trump has repeatedly said taking control of Greenland is vital for U.S. national security, frequently citing concerns about Russia and China's Arctic influence.The comments have raised alarm across Europe and prompted demonstrations in Copenhagen and Greenland's capital, Nuuk, over the weekend.  watch nowTrump sought to raise the stakes even further on Saturday when he announced a rising wave of tariffs on eight European countries if they oppose his bid to acquire Greenland. An extra levy of 10% will apply to the U.K., Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, the Netherlands, and Finland from Feb. 1, Trump said, before rising to 25% from June 1.European political leaders called the tariffs \"unacceptable\" and vowed to back Denmark, which is responsible for the island's foreign, defense, and security policies.The EU is also reportedly considering retaliatory measures against the Trump administration's fresh import levies, including a so-called trade \"bazooka\" and broader economic countermeasures. 'Arctic Endurance' exerciseDenmark has sought to beef up its military presence in Greenland, according to local media reports.  A \"substantial contribution\" of Danish combat troops were expected to arrive in Greenland's Kangerlussuaq on Monday evening, Danish broadcaster TV2 reported. Kangerlussuaq, in western Greenland, is home to the island's major international transport hub.Denmark's top military commander in the Arctic, Major General Søren Andersen, reportedly said that 100 Danish soldiers had already arrived in Nuuk and a similar number in Kangerlussuaq. The troops are expected to take part in an a military exercise dubbed \"Arctic Endurance.\"  Danish soldiers disembark an airplane at Nuuk airport, Greenland, on January 19, 2026.Mads Claus Rasmussen | Afp | Getty ImagesThe operation, which is centered on countering potential Russian activity, Reuters reported last week, rather than in response to the Trump administration, comes less than a week after several NATO allies deployed small numbers of troops to Greenland for a separate joint military exercise.Danish government representatives are not expected to attend the World Economic Forum this week, a WEF spokesperson confirmed, as the dispute over Greenland intensifies.Opinion polls have shown that Greenlanders overwhelmingly oppose U.S. control, while a strong majority support independence from Denmark.",

    "body": "President Donald Trump speaks as he meets with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington, Oct. 22, 2025.Kevin Lamarque | ReutersTrade attorneys tell CNBC that the looming U.S. Supreme Court ruling on President Donald Trump's tariffs could impact Trump's threats to levy new tariffs on NATO members over the issue of Greenland's sovereignty. The targeted tariff threats made by Trump over the weekend would likely rest on the same legal authority under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to be decided by the Supreme Court.\"Although the president hasn't specified if these tariffs would be IEEPA-based, the U.S. Supreme Court decision on IEEPA would likely affect the outcome of the threatened Greenland tariffs,\" said Michael Lowell, partner and chair of the Global Regulatory Enforcement Group at Reed Smith.\"Similar to the Brazil tariffs; if the Supreme Court rules IEEPA doesn't give the president tariff power, then these tariffs being threatened on NATO members would be illegal,\" Lowell said.Trump announced Saturday that if a deal is not reached allowing Washington to acquire Greenland, the eight European countries would face increasing tariffs, starting at 10% on Feb. 1 and rising to 25% on June 1. The Court's latest batch of decisions issued Tuesday morning did not include the tariffs case.In the event that the Court overturns the tariffs, new legal measures may be need to be taken by companies from within the NATO bloc that would be in the position of having to pay the threatened tariffs. \"It may still be necessary for companies that import from those countries to bring suit to enforce,\" continued Lowell said. But he added, \"that would be a quick lawsuit since the law would be clear by the ruling.\"watch nowTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Sunday said it's \"very unlikely\" that the Supreme Court will overturn Trump's use of emergency powers to impose tariffs, with a potential decision from the court looming as early as this week. Even if the administration loses, Trump officials have said that new tariffs will go into effect immediately.If Trump's IEEPA authority were taken away, one of the measures that the administration may turn to is Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962. Trade attorneys say the president could use the recently completed Section 232 investigation on critical minerals to levy tariffs. Greenland is a mineral-rich island that is a semi-autonomous territory of Denmark.In the January proclamation from the White House, Trump invoked Section 232 authorities to direct the negotiation of agreements with foreign nations to \"ensure the United States has adequate critical mineral supplies and to mitigate the supply chain vulnerabilities as quickly as possible.\"If negotiations do not work, the proclamation states \"it may be appropriate to impose import restrictions, such as tariffs, if satisfactory agreements are not reached in a timely manner.\"While recent Section 232 actions from Trump included the immediate imposition of tariffs on products, in the latest Section 232 policy on critical minerals the language states that the executive branch of the government reserves the right for the president to impose tariffs.\"Regardless of the IEEPA outcome, Section 232 remains a powerful and unaffected tool that the administration will likely continue to deploy for additional tariffs. Importantly, we note that these tariffs do not stack on top of IEEPA tariffs,\" TD Cowen analysts wrote in a recent note to clients. ",

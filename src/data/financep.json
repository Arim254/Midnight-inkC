    "body": "Todd Combs, portfolio manager and investment officer of Berkshire Hathaway Inc., arrives for the morning session of the Allen & Co. Media and Technology Conference in Sun Valley, Idaho, U.S., on Friday, July 12, 2019.Patrick T. Fallon / Bloomberg / Getty ImagesWarren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway announced a number of structural changes before the legendary CEO steps aside at the end of this year, among them the departure of Todd Combs, investment officer and Geico CEO.Combs, 54, will be joining JPMorgan Chase as head of the bank's new Security and Resiliency Initiative, to find direct equity investments in the defense, aerospace, healthcare and energy industries.Combs \"has resigned to accept an interesting and important job at JPMorgan,\" said Buffett, 95, in a press release from Berkshire. \"Todd made many great hires at GEICO and broadened its horizons. JPMorgan, as usually is the case, has made a good decision.\"Combs joined Berkshire in 2010 from his hedge fund Castle Point and was brought in, along with Ted Weschler, to help manage Berkshire's portfolio of investments. Buffett is handing over the CEO reins to Greg Abel in 2026 and Combs' departure leaves some questions as to how the sizable equity holdings of Berkshire, which include Apple, Bank of America and Coca-Cola, will continue to be managed when he steps down. Among some of the other notable changes at Berkshire are the retirement effective in June 2027 of chief financial officer Marc Hamburg, who served under Buffett for 40 years. Charles Chang, current CFO of Berkshire Hathaway Energy will replace him. Nancy Pierce, chief operating officer of Geico, will replace Combs as CEO of Geico. The conglomerate also said the CEO of its NetJets unit, Adam Johnson, will serve in a new role as president of Berkshire's consumer products, service and retailing businesses. Abel will directly oversee the remaining noninsurance businesses, Berkshire said.$1.5 trillion JPMorgan initiativeCombs, who was a member of JPMorgan's board of directors, will also become a special advisor to CEO Jamie Dimon. Combs is giving up his board seat as he moves into the new role.\"Todd Combs is one of the greatest investors and leaders I've known, having successfully managed investments alongside the most respected and successful long-term investor of our time, Warren Buffett,\" said Dimon in a release. \"Having served nine years on our Board, he truly understands all aspects of our company, and he supports the role we play helping make the world better and safer for all its citizens.\"Combs will have $10 billion to deploy to start with for JPMorgan's new initiative, which the bank said will ultimately commit $1.5 trillion to spur economic growth \"make the world more secure.\"The Security and Resiliency Initiative will have an outside council to guide its strategy which includes, Amazon's Jeff Bezos, Dell Chairman Michael Dell, former Secretary of Defense Robert Gates and former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice.Despite his advanced age, Buffett surprised shareholders at the conglomerate's annual meeting in May when he said he would be stepping aside for Abel, who is 63 and current vice chairman of noninsurance operations. The stock has underperformed this year in part because of angst over what Berkshire will look like after Buffett, who took over the textiles manufacturer in 1965 and turned it into an investment holding company that went on to post an unprecedented long-term track record. Berkshire shares are up 11% this year, below the 17% return of the S&P 500. Buffett, who will remain chairman, noted in a Thanksgiving message that he still feels good, however he is moving slowly and reading with \"increasing difficulty.\"",

    "body": "People hold a sign as they participate in a protest outside the U.S. Supreme Court over President Donald Trump's move to end birthright citizenship as the court hears arguments over the order in Washington, May 15, 2025.Drew Angerer | Afp | Getty ImagesThe Supreme Court on Friday said it will hear arguments in a case that will determine if President Donald Trump can undo automatic citizenship for people born in the United States.Trump, on his first day back in the White House on Jan. 20, issued an executive order that said babies born in the U.S. more than 30 days after that order were not entitled to be issued citizenship documents if their parents were temporary visitors or illegal immigrants.Before Trump's order, there was little dispute that the U.S. Constitution's 14th Amendment, with rare exceptions, meant that children born in the country were automatically U.S. citizens, regardless of their parents' status.The Citizenship Clause in that amendment says, \"All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States.\" The Supreme Court, which is expected to rule next year, will determine if Trump's executive order complies with that amendment.The order told federal agencies to refuse to recognize the citizenship of children born in the U.S. if their mother \"was unlawfully present in the United States and the person's father was not a United States citizen or lawful permanent resident at the time of said person's birth,\" or when the baby's \"mother's presence in the United States was lawful but temporary, and the person's father was not a United States citizen or lawful permanent resident at the time.\"Several federal district court judges have found that Trump's order violated the Constitution, and two federal circuit courts of appeals upheld injunctions blocking the order from taking effect.",

    "body": "Passengers seen in heavy rush and chaos at the IndiGo counter at Indira Gandhi International Airport Terminal 1 after a technical glitch at IndiGo caused delays and cancellations of multiple flights on Dec. 4, 2025 in New Delhi, India. Hindustan Times | Hindustan Times | Getty ImagesShares of Interglobe Aviation, operator of India's largest airline Indigo, fell more than 8% Monday as the carrier grapples with multiple flight cancellations.Indigo, which operates more than 2,300 flights daily, could only fly 706 flights on Friday following a change in rules about pilots' rest time for pilots, leading to massive disruptions.On Sunday, the company said in a release that it operated 1,650 flights and it expects \"stabilization of the network\" by Wednesday. India's civil aviation minister Ram Mohan Naidu said on Monday that the government has ordered an investigation into the disruptions of Indigo's flight services.\"We will take strict action,\" the minister said, warning the airline of consequences for \"non-compliance.\"Passenger woesChirag Shah, an EY consultant who was travelling from Abu Dhabi to Mumbai with his family, faced an 11-hour delay.He said travellers, especially those with a single-entry visa, were left stranded.That 11-hour delay exposed \"a worrying lack of passenger support,\" Shah told CNBC, adding that a few passengers were re-seated on a different Indigo flight \"after hours of follow-ups with the airport authorities.\"Indigo has not said whether it has issued all refunds for cancelled and severely delayed flights, after a government directive gave it until Sunday, 8 PM India time to do so. Indigo had processed 6.10 billion rupees (USD 67.6 million) as of 5 pm that day.Shah said that the only conciliatory offer he had had was a McDonalds' free meal coupon.Indigo Airlines and the Civil Aviation Ministry had not responded to requests for comment from CNBC when this article went live.The rule changeOn Thursday, the airline told the ministry that cancellations were due to \"challenges in crew planning and implementation of the revised Flight Duty Time Limitations (FDTL) norms.\"Under the rules, announced in January 2024 and in effect since Nov. 1, pilots are expected to fly fewer late-night flights and rest time for crew has been increased from 36 hours to 48 hours.On Friday, after disruptions due to flight cancellations by Indigo peaked, the government temporarily suspended its implementation of Flight Duty Time Limitations rules.Indigo's CEO, Pieter Elbers, was ordered by India's aviation watchdog to explain the disruption and has been granted an extension for sending his responses, according to local media reports.There were 1.3 million scheduled flights in India in 2024, of which 1.1 million were domestic flights, per the International Air Transport Association.Indigo dominates Indian air transport in terms of scheduled seat capacity with a market share of around 53.4%, up from 23% in 2016.",

    "body": "When shopping for holiday gifts, it can be hard to guess which ones will actually be useful instead of sitting untouched in the box. The things people keep around are generally the ones they reach for when they need them — a travel bag that makes a weekend trip easier, a kitchen device that speeds up dinner or a home appliance that proves its worth every time you use it.One way to find these types of gifts is to ask people what they swear by. With that in mind, CNBC Make It staffers shared the items that genuinely proved their worth in 2025. Here are six splurges they say are worth the money.1. Camera bird feederPrice: $100It's usually tough finding the perfect Father's Day gift for my dad. This year, I came across the Birdfy Feeder, a smart bird feeder with a camera. It has been a hit with the whole family as we've been able to peek at several colorful birds and even a deer sneaking in for a quick snack. It's like a little portal allowing us to get up close to wildlife.— Tasia Jensen, Video Producer2. Weekender bagPrice: $138Last year, I used the holiday travel season as an excuse to finally ditch my old backpack and get a proper travel bag. I sprang for the Calpak Luka Duffel. The bag itself is pretty compact but fits a ton — 25 liters of stuff to be exact. It has nine pockets to keep everything organized, including one at the bottom to store a pair of shoes separately. The fabric is lightweight, but durable, and kept my belongings dry in the rain.Best of all, it's designed to fit under any airplane seat and, because it stands upright, I still had plenty of legroom on either side to stretch out.— Jennifer Liu, Senior Work Reporter3. InstantPot air fryerPrice: $220The Instant Pot Duo Air Fryer is a pressure cooker, air fryer and so much more. My mom got it for me and initially I was like, \"This takes up way too much cabinet space.\" But I've been so happy with it that I've convinced my grandfather and godmother to buy one too. It is big and a little heavy, but my building is all electric, and using this as opposed to my stove for most cooking has lowered my electricity use by around 25% compared with this time last year, which has lowered the bill. Woot! It's super convenient, quick and I feel much safer using this than other pressure cooking devices I've tried in the past.— Meline Rosales, Producer4. AirPod ProsPrice: $249I was mysteriously moody all of April. I resisted doing chores, going to the gym and commuting felt especially irksome. The culprit: My beloved, 4.5-year-old AirPod Pros were driving me insane. The right bud, if jostled, blasted a loud static into my fragile ear drum. The left, somehow, was never charged. Their unpredictably left me exposed to noises like car horns, crying babies and gym bro grunts.I waited another two weeks, then submitted to reality. I'm not strong enough to live, work or travel without podcasts or music. I splurged on an upgrade: I bought the AirPod Pros 2. (Newer models are now available.)I got them engraved for free and they took less than a week to show up on my Brooklyn doorstep. Doing the dishes, grocery shopping and existing in New York City has never felt more tolerable.— Megan Sauer, Success Reporter5. Wet/dry vacuumPrice: $370When my husband and I moved into our new house, among all the boxes and furniture the movers brought into our home, they left one much less desirable thing behind: boot marks. It was one of the coldest days of the year and it had just snowed two days prior, so all day long (through no fault of their own) the movers tracked melting ice and slush throughout the house. Luckily, before we relocated, we took my sister-in-law's advice to buy a Tineco wet/dry vacuum, which acts as a sort of mop/vac hybrid. At the end of our exhausting moving day, I added some cleaner to the fresh water chamber and used the vacuum throughout our main bedroom and bathroom so that we could safely go barefoot as we prepared for bed. It was pretty gross to see how dirty the floors had been, but extremely satisfying to see the wood start to shine again.— Hanna Howard, Senior Work Editor6. Professional cameraPrice: $660I've been a video production professional for several years and have always had access to production gear, so it's rare that I purchase something for personal use. However, after picking up the DJI Osmo Pocket 3 Creator Combo, I've been nothing but impressed. It's small, yet powerful, capturing amazingly high-quality images. With a few setting adjustments, it delivers footage comparable to cameras that cost thousands of dollars more that I use in a professional setting. What's also great about it is how easy it is to use, whether you're a professional or a hobbyist. You can just pick up and go! This purchase has also added to my creativity, to the point where I now carry the Osmo with me during my commute and travels, capturing whatever catches my eye. Its small size makes it convenient to take anywhere and allows me to be discrete for street photography/filming sessions.— Eric Clark, Senior Managing ProducerCNBC Make It independently determines what we cover and recommend in the \"Worth the Money\" section.

    "body": "(L/R) Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and US President Donald Trump stand for a family photo with other European leaders in the Cross Hall of the White House in Washington, DC, on August 18, 2025. Andrew Caballero-Reynolds | AFP | Getty ImagesTensions are mounting once again between U.S. President Donald Trump and President Volodymyr Zelenskyy after the White House leader accused Ukraine's head of state of not even reading the U.S.' peace proposals yet.\"I'm a little bit disappointed that President Zelenskyy hasn't yet read the proposal, that was as of a few hours ago,\" Trump told reporters on Sunday night.  \"His people love it, but he hasn't [read it],\" Trump added.\"Russia, I guess, would rather have the whole country when you think of it, but Russia is, I believe, fine with it, but I'm not sure that Zelenskyy is fine with it,\" Trump said.It's uncertain which version of the U.S.-backed peace plan for Ukraine Trump was referring to but the president's comments came a day after talks between U.S. and Ukrainian officials ended in Miami without an apparent agreement over the latest version of a draft peace plan.There have been several versions of the purported peace plan as Russia and Ukraine have haggled — via their American intermediaries — over key details within the deal, particularly when it comes to demands for territorial concessions by Russia and security guarantees for Ukraine. Trump's outgoing Ukraine envoy Keith Kellogg remarked Sunday that a deal to end the war was \"really close\" and that it depended on resolving two main outstanding issues: the future of Ukraine's Donbas eastern region, which is broadly occupied by Russian forces, and the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in southern Ukraine.Ukraine has given a more cautious appraisal of the talks' progress with Zelenskyy saying in his nightly address Sunday that the Miami talks — held between his new chief negotiator Rustem Umerov and Ukraine's military chief of general staff, General Andriy Hnatov, and Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff and son-in-law Jared Kushner — were \"constructive, though not easy.\" Zelenskyy said he would have a detailed debrief with his negotiating team in person rather than over the phone, noting, somewhat pointedly, that \"some matters can only be discussed in person.\"Talks move to LondonZelenskyy is travelling to London for talks on Monday as Kyiv and its European allies scramble to ensure that Ukraine's territorial integrity and future security (as well as Europe's) are not compromised in the face of growing U.S. pressure to agree to peace proposals initially seen as heavily favorable to Russia.Zelenskyy is due to meet U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer, French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Friedrich Merz for talks \"which will focus on the ongoing peace negotiations and next steps,\" Downing Street said Sunday. Zelenskyy will also travel to Brussels and Rome for further talks this week.Britain's Prime Minister Keir Starmer talks to French President Emmanuel Macron during a meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and other European leaders amid negotiations to end the Russian war in Ukraine, at the White House in Washington, D.C., U.S., August 18, 2025. Alexander Drago | ReutersUkraine's European allies are anxious to be seen and heard as peace proposals are discussed without their involvement, particularly given the security ramifications any deal will have for the wider continent.The U.K. and France have been leading proponents of a \"Coalition of the Willing,\" a group of countries that could be part of a \"reassurance force\" in a post-war Ukraine that helps to guarantee its security. Russia vehemently opposes the idea of foreign troops being deployed in Ukraine however, with Russian President Vladimir Putin saying they would be \"legitimate targets.\"European leaders will be feeling more nervous about the U.S.' potential for accommodating Russian demands after the release of Trump's latest national security strategy last Friday, which said Europe risked \"civilisational erasure\" and that it was \"far from obvious\" whether European countries can \"remain reliable allies.\" The document also stated that Washington should reestablish strategic stability with Russia.The Kremlin on Sunday praised the new strategy, saying it largely accorded with Russia's \"vision.\"While both the U.S. and Russia share a mutual desire for a future rapprochement, some distance remains when it comes to an immediate peace agreement over Ukraine. Talks between Witkoff, Kushner and Russian officials held in Moscow last week also concluded without a breakthrough, with Russian presidential aide Yuri Ushakov telling reporters that the discussions were \"very useful, constructive, and highly informative\" but that there was more work to be done.Russian President Vladimir Putin, presidential envoy Kirill Dmitriev and foreign policy aide Yuri Ushakov attend a meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff and son-in-law Jared Kushner at the Kremlin in Moscow, Russia, Dec. 2, 2025.Alexander Kazakov | Via ReutersThe Kremlin also commented on Trump's criticism of Zelenskyy, with Putin's Press Secretary Dmitry Peskov telling reporters Monday:\"We don't know exactly what disagreements there are. What matters to us is this: A thorough amount of work was done in Moscow during Putin's meeting with Witkoff and Kushner and afterward, Witkoff and Kushner continued working with the delegation of Ukrainian negotiators led by Umerov on the basis of the results achieved in Moscow,\" he said, in comments translated by NBC News.\"Now it's important for us to understand what the outcome of that work is. It's clear that both sides now understand that such work needs to be done in silence. This kind of work cannot be conducted entirely in public. It's counterproductive. Most importantly, it prevents results from being achieved. So we expect to receive this information. Once we do, things will become clear,\" he stated.",

    "body": "The Trump administration views the proposed $72 billion deal for Netflix to acquire Warner Bros. Discovery's film and streaming assets with \"heavy skepticism,\" a senior administration official told CNBC's Eamon Javers on Friday morning.Netflix said Friday that it would acquire Warner Bros.' film studio and streaming service, HBO Max. The deal is subject to regulatory approval.Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., said, \"This deal looks like an anti-monopoly nightmare.\"\"A Netflix-Warner Bros. would create one massive media giant with control of close to half of the streaming market — threatening to force Americans into higher subscription prices and fewer choices over what and how they watch, while putting American workers at risk,\" Warren said in a statement.\"Under Donald Trump, the antitrust review process has also become a cesspool of political favoritism and corruption,\" Warren said. \"The Justice Department must enforce our nation's anti-monopoly laws fairly and transparently — not use the Warner Bros. deal review to invite influence-peddling and bribery.\"Paramount Skydance had made multiple bids for the entirety of WBD, as opposed to a subset of the company's assets. Paramount's final bid, which was received Thursday evening, was for $30 per share, all cash, CNBC previously reported. Comcast also made a bid for WBD's film and streaming properties.The New York Post on Thursday reported that, \"Paramount Skydance chief David Ellison met with Trump officials and key lawmakers in Washington DC on Wednesday to press his case against Warner Bros. Discovery's potential selection of Netflix as its merger partner.\"Ellison's billionaire father, Larry Ellison, is close to President Donald Trump.On Thursday, The Wall Street Journal reported that Paramount, in a letter to lawyers for WBD, had warned that a sale to Netflix likely would \"never close\" because of regulatory challenges in the United States and overseas.\"Acquiring Warner's streaming and studio assets 'will entrench and extend Netflix's global dominance in a matter not allowed by domestic or foreign competition laws,' Paramount's lawyers wrote,\" the Journal reported.Netflix's purchase of WBD's assets is expected to close, if approved by regulators, after WBD completes its previously planned spinout of Discovery Global, which is currently planned to occur in the third quarter of 2026.Discovery Global would include the CNN, TNT Sports and Discovery channels. A Securities and Exchange Commission filing shows that Netflix agreed to pay a $5.8 billion reverse break-up fee if the deal does not receive approval.CNBC requested comment from Netflix, WBD, Paramount, and Comcast.Trump, even before taking office for his first term in the White House, opposed a deal by AT&T to buy Time Warner, saying \"it's too much concentration of power in the hands of too few.\" After he took office, the Department of Justice in November 2017 sued in an effort to prevent the merger.The DOJ lost that lawsuit, and the merger was closed in June 2018.Before the 2024 presidential election, Trump opposed the then-proposed sale of U.S. Steel to Nippon Steel of Japan. But after reentering the White House in January, Trump in June signed an executive order approving the merger, after the companies signed a national security agreement with the U.S. government.The agreement gave the U.S. government a \"golden share\" in the merged company, which Trump claims gives a president \"total control.\" Experts said the share gives the government an outsized say in corporate governance.Correction: A senior administration official said the Trump administration views the deal with 'heavy skepticism.' A previous version mischaracterized the official.Disclosure: Comcast is the parent company of NBCUniversal, which owns CNBC. Versant would become the new parent company of CNBC upon Comcast's planned spinoff of Versant.",

    "body": "The logo for Google LLC is seen at the Google Store Chelsea in Manhattan, New York City, U.S., November 17, 2021. Andrew Kelly | ReutersA U.S. judge on Friday added new details to the remedies resulting from Google's antitrust case, finalizing the consequences the company faces after its defeat last year.In mid-2024, Google was found to hold an illegal monopoly in its core market of internet search, and in September of this year, U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta ruled against the most severe consequences that were proposed by the Department of Justice, including a forced sale of Google's Chrome browser.Google was, however, ordered to loosen its hold on search data.Mehta on Friday issued additional details for his ruling. \"The age-old saying 'the devil is in the details' may not have been devised with the drafting of an antitrust remedies judgment in mind, but it sure does fit,\" Mehta wrote in one of the Friday filings. Mehta wrote that Google can't enter into any deal like the one it's had with Apple \"unless the agreement terminates no more than one year after the date it is entered.\" Google pays billions of dollars per year to Apple to be the default search engine on the Safari browser on iPhones, Macs and iPads.The judge's ruling includes deals involving generative artificial intelligence products, and any \"application, software, service, feature, tool, functionality, or product\" that involve or use genAI or large language models.GenAI \"plays a significant role in these remedies,\" Mehta wrote.Mehta on Friday also included requirements on the makeup of a technical committee that will determine with whom Google must share its data. Committee \"members shall be experts in some combination of software engineering, information retrieval, artificial intelligence, economics, behavioral science, and data privacy and data security,\" the filing says.The judge went on to say that no committee member can have a conflict of interest, such as having worked for Google or any of its competitors in the six months prior to or one year after serving in the role.Mehta said the committee must \"have access to Google's source code and algorithms, subject to a confidentiality agreement,\" and reiterated the web index data it will require Google to share with certain competitors. Google has to share some of the raw search interaction data it uses to train its ranking and AI systems, but not the actual algorithms. In September, Mehta said those data sets represent a \"small fraction\" of Google's overall traffic, but argued the company's models are trained on data that contributed to Google's edge over competitors.In August 2024, Mehta ruled that Google violated Section 2 of the Sherman Act and held a monopoly in search and related advertising. The antitrust trial started in September 2023.Google did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The company has previously said it will appeal the judge's monopoly ruling.WATCH: Judge Issues final remedies in Google antitrust casewatch now",

    "body": "Attendees speak with representatives at the Barrick booth, at the Prospectors and Developers Association of Canada (PDAC) annual mining conference in Toronto, Ontario, Canada March 3, 2025. Carlos Osorio | ReutersCompany: Barrick Mining (B)Business: Barrick Mining, formerly Barrick Gold Corporation, is a gold and copper producer, which is engaged in the production and sale of gold and copper, as well as related activities, such as exploration and mine development. It has ownership interests in producing gold mines in Argentina, Canada, Cote d'Ivoire, the Democratic Republic of Congo, the Dominican Republic, Papua New Guinea, Tanzania and the United States. Its copper mines are in Zambia, Chile and Saudi Arabia. Its operations include Nevada Gold Mines, Bulyanhulu, Hemlo, Jabal Sayid, Kibali, Loulo-Gounkoto, Lumwana, North Mara, Porgera, Pueblo Viejo, Tongon, Veladero and Zaldivar. Its Bulyanhulu operation is located in northwest Tanzania, over 55 kilometers south of Lake Victoria and 150 km southwest of the city of Mwanza. The Jabal Sayid copper operation is located 350 km northeast of Jeddah in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The Lumwana copper mine is a conventional open pit operation.Stock Market Value: $69.16 billion ($40.38 per share)Stock Chart IconStock chart iconBarrick Mining shares year to dateActivist: Elliott Investment ManagementOwnership: n/aAverage Cost: n/aActivist Commentary: Elliott is a multistrategy investment firm that manages about $76.1 billion in assets (as of June 30, 2025) and is one of the oldest firms of its type under continuous management. Known for its extensive due diligence and resources, Elliott regularly follows companies for years before making an investment. Elliott is the most active of activist investors, engaging with companies across industries and multiple geographies.What's happeningOn Nov. 18, Elliott announced a position in Barrick Mining and expressed its interest in seeing a potential separation of North American assets from its mines in riskier regions across Asia and Africa. Most recently, on Dec. 1, Barrick announced that the board has authorized the company to explore a potential separation of the North American assets.Behind the scenesBarrick Mining is a Toronto-based global mining company focused predominantly on gold, operating 14 gold mines, as well as three additional cooper mines. The core of this business is its North America Gold assets, which consists of some of the highest quality deposits in the world, specifically Nevada Gold Mines, a joint venture with Newmont in which Barrick owns 61.5% and serves as its operator. The company also operates gold mines in Africa, the Middle East, Latin America, and Asia. Its copper portfolio is centered around Africa and the Middle East, including Reko Diq, a new copper development project in Pakistan. With the recent bull market for gold, Barrick's stock has more than doubled over the past six months. Despite this, Barrick continues to trade at 0.9 times its price to net asset value ratio, a significant discount to North American peers, who trade well above 1x, with best-in-class peers like Agnico Eagle trading at approximately 1.5x.Investors buy gold companies primarily for gold price exposure, and from there prefer the companies with the best management teams that operate the companies most efficiently to best isolate the value of the commodity. Barrick has not been a top operator amongst its peers and, as a result, they abruptly parted ways with their CEO in September and replaced him with Mark Hill, the former COO, as interim CEO. An interim CEO creates two very valuable opportunities for an activist in a company like Barrick. First and most importantly, they get to have a voice in who the new CEO will be regardless of whether they settle with the company for a board seat or just remain an outspoken shareholder. While they may not always be in the room when the discussions are had or the decision is made, we know of no CEO who would take a job at a company with an activist like Elliott engaging unless they knew that Elliott approved of the hiring. Second, when a company has an interim CEO, it is an advantageous time to explore strategic alternatives, and a breakup of this company has always been the elephant in the room. Barrick's North American operations have been sullied by the company's exposure to higher-risk regions and separating the two would go a long way to close the valuation gap between Barrick and Agnico Eagle. The value proposition for a breakup is clear and even something management has discussed. In a presentation released in May, management demonstrated that applying a peer-like multiple to Barrick's North American assets could unlock as much as 49% of unrealized value. Since then, the price of gold has appreciated by over 70% but the company's stock has appreciated by more than 100%, so much of that gain has been realized but there is still some value to be realized from a breakup.  Elliott has a history of taking board seats at companies not for activist's sake, but only when they feel that the director they are putting on the board could genuinely add value for shareholders. In this case, the breakup of the company is something that is being seriously considered by the board, and Elliott, just by its existence, is likely to have at least negative approval power over the new CEO. Moreover, Elliott does not act impetuously in its activism. They have likely had a position in Barrick for many months at this point and have already received a great return from the company's 100% appreciation in the past six months. We would not expect them to escalate their activism here unless either the board goes down a path they didn't expect and don't agree with, or it is at the company's invitation to join the board to assist with the tasks ahead.Ken Squire is the founder and president of 13D Monitor, an institutional research service on shareholder activism, and the founder and portfolio manager of the 13D Activist Fund, a mutual fund that invests in a portfolio of activist investments.",

    "body": "Paramount Skydance CEO David Ellison speaks during the Bloomberg Screentime conference in Los Angeles on October 9, 2025.Patrick T. Fallon | Afp | Getty ImagesThis isn't exactly what David Ellison had planned in September. Just a few months ago, the Paramount Skydance CEO sent a letter to the Warner Bros. Discovery board of directors arguing a combination of the two media and entertainment companies made sense. That letter was the first of several that offered increasingly higher prices to acquire the company along with arguments of why the assets were better together.Paramount's interest spurred a formal sale process — bringing Comcast and Netflix into the mix — which ultimately doubled the value of Warner Bros. Discovery shares and culminated, at least for the moment, in Paramount losing out in the bidding war it started.  On Friday, Netflix announced a deal to acquire HBO Max and the famed Warner Bros. film studio for $27.75 per share, or an equity value of $72 billion. WBD will move forward with a plan to separate out its pay-TV networks, such as CNN and TNT Sports, before the deal closes. Instead of supercharging Paramount, just months after gaining control of the company through a merger with Skydance, Ellison effectively handed a prized jewel of the media and entertainment industry to its most dominant player, strengthening Netflix's reach and stripping Paramount and Comcast's NBCUniversal of an obvious merger target. \"It wasn't for sale before, and they certainly hadn't cleaned up the assets or separated the assets in the way they have right now,\" said Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos in a conference call Friday morning after announcing the deal. \"I think that kind of goes to the 'why now.'\"Ellison jump-started a process that has made a lot of money for Warner Bros. Discovery CEO David Zaslav, WBD's executive team and its shareholders. Zaslav's shareZaslav currently owns more than 4.2 million shares of Warner Bros. Discovery, with another 6.2 million shares that would be delivered to him in the future via previously granted stock awards, according to Equilar. Zaslav also has a grant of almost 20.9 million options with an exercise price of $10.16, Equilar found.Based on the Netflix-WBD transaction price of $27.75 per share, all of that adds up to more than $554 million for the WBD CEO. Factoring in another 4 million shares that Zaslav is set to receive in January, according to a person close to the situation who declined to be named speaking about the executive's holdings, the true total is closer to $660 million.For shareholders, the sale process has brought a similar windfall. Warner Bros. Discovery stock closed at $12.54 on Sept. 10, the day before The Wall Street Journal reported Paramount was preparing a bid for the company. On Friday morning, Warner Bros. Discovery shares were up almost 3% to more than $25 apiece. That's more than double Warner Bros. Discovery's unaffected sale process price and a return to 2022 levels when WarnerMedia and Discovery first merged. That's vindication for Zaslav, who has spent nearly four years coming under fire from Hollywood and investors for failing to deliver for shareholders. With Friday's announcement, he's effectively pulled victory from the jaws of defeat. And still, Paramount is likely not done with its pursuit of buying all of Warner Bros. Discovery.Paramount's hostile playEllison has wasted no time at the helm of Paramount Skydance, transforming the company through deals and acquisitions.Since the merger closed in August, Paramount has brought on C-suite executives and high-profile Hollywood talent such as the Duffer Brothers. It secured the rights to develop a live-action feature film based on Activision's Call of Duty video game franchise and struck a $7.7 billion deal for UFC rights. Ellison's hunt for Warner Bros. Discovery was his biggest endeavor since taking control of the company.Paramount's lawyers sent a letter to Warner Bros. Discovery this week, first reported by CNBC, claiming the sale process had been rigged in Netflix's direction. Paramount has accused Warner Bros. Discovery of failing to properly consider its offer of $30, all-cash, and instead selling to Netflix as a predetermined outcome. Netflix made an initial bid for WBD's studio and streaming assets of $27 a share, according to a person familiar with the matter. That trumped Paramount's offer at the time and turned the trajectory of the sales talks in Netflix's direction, said the person, who asked not to be named because the discussions were private.Paramount was the only bidder interested in acquiring all of WBD's assets — the film studio, streaming service and TV networks. It has maintained that its offer is superior. Paramount's executives and advisors valued the Discovery Global networks portfolio at close to $2 a share, based on its predicted trading multiple and estimated leverage ratio, according to people familiar with the matter, who asked not to be named because the discussions were private. Discovery Global would include the CNN, TNT Sports and Discovery channels.Warner Bros. Discovery believes Discovery Global could have a value of $3 per share or more if it trades well in the public markets, according to other people with direct knowledge of the matter.Paramount has also argued there are tax efficiencies for shareholders in acquiring the whole company rather than buying only a portion of it, and that Netflix's bid comes with steeper regulatory risk. The Trump administration's view of the proposed combination is one of \"heavy skepticism,\" CNBC reported Friday.Paramount offered a break-up fee of $5 billion if the proposed deal didn't get regulatory approval, according to the people familiar.  Netflix's bid included a $5.8 billion break-up fee in case the deal doesn't get regulatory approval, according to a Securities and Exchange Commission filing Friday. Paramount is now weighing its options about whether to go straight to shareholders with one more improved bid — perhaps even higher than the $30-per-share, all-cash offer it submitted to WBD this week. If it does, Netflix would have a chance to match that bid. The end result would mean even more money for WBD shareholders — and more money for Zaslav.— CNBC's Nick Wells contributed to this report.

    "body": "Shoppers may be feeling sticker shock with the cost of beef at the grocery store.Prices in the beef and veal category are up 14.7%, while overall food is up 3.1% from September 2024 to September 2025 — the latest publicly available consumer price index data due to the government shutdown in October.But expenses for America's farmers are soaring too. Input costs for ranchers are up more than 50% over the past five years, according to the American Farm Bureau Federation.\"It's hard as a beef producer to necessarily say that beef prices are too high. I mean, if people are paying $6 for a latte at Starbucks, but then they're paying $6 for a pound of beef, they're able to feed a family for a family of three with that pound of beef,\" said Taylon Lienemann, co-owner of Linetics Ranch in Princeton, Nebraksa.A major driver of the rising price of beef prices stems from a record low cattle supply. The start of 2025 saw the smallest national herd since 1951.The cattle cycle is the natural expansion and contraction of the U.S. cattle herd — which is tied to supply and demand. It typically occurs every eight to 12 years. When producers can get higher prices for their cattle, they will likely retain more females, called heifers, for breeding. When the cattle supply increases, prices eventually go down and the herds contract again. \"It's the big question right now for our producers. You know, they have a 50/50 decision to make. Do we sell these cattle off into the supply system or do we hold them back? And I think when the money is on the table, there's an incentive to go ahead and sell those to the food supply system, especially when demand is so high from the consumer,\" said Adam Wegner, director of marketing for the Nebraska Beef Council.Severe drought can also impact the decision for a rancher to retain cattle for breeding. \"When you're in a drought, you're producing minimal feed and or hay or alfalfa,\" Lienemann said. \"The amount of cattle that are out there are still out there, and they're still needing that feed.\" During times of drought, ranchers will often supplement grass feed with grain. Grain prices have come down significantly since 2022, but it can still be an unexpected cost for producers.\"What we're experiencing now is a sort of a mashup of drought, high demand and low heifer retention, sort of making up this herd size problem that we have today in America,\" said Omaha Steaks CEO Nate Rempe. \"We have got to build the herd, period.\"The direct-to-consumer meat company said it hasn't raised prices in over three years but it's now feeling the pinch.\"The cost of beef has increased so much that it's really starting to hit our bottom line,\" Rempe said. \"We're looking internally all the time. How can we find efficiencies? How can we invest in our business to drive more volume for less cost? But there is some breaking point, right? There is some point at which the raw material that we need is at a price point, that we're going to have to start passing some of that on.\"Despite smaller herd numbers, beef production has increased overall because the U.S. is producing bigger cattle. Incremental supply, mainly for ground beef, also comes from beef imports, which have been increasing steadily over the past decade. Now a rapidly evolving tariffs situation in Brazil and parasitic cattle infections in Mexico are further driving up prices for consumers. Still, experts say that the domestic herd is most critical for long term relief.\"In the short run, if we actually begin retaining heifers to put into the breeding herd, that actually is going to reduce total domestic beef production because we have fewer animals going to the feedlot. So that's going to actually keep prices supported that much more in the short run. But within that three-year period that we're talking about, we'll start seeing that increased production feed into the system, which should start to [soften] beef prices and cattle prices alike,\" said Andrew Griffith, an agricultural and resource economics professor at the University of Tennessee.Watch the video to see an exclusive look at Omaha Steaks' processing facilities and to learn more about how high inflation is affecting the beef industry.",

Southwest was due to make the last payment next month.\"Southwest Airlines is grateful to [Transportation] Secretary [Sean] Duffy and the DOT Team for recognizing Southwest's significant investments in modernizing our operations,\" Southwest said Saturday. \"During the last two years, Southwest successfully completed an operational turnaround that directly benefits our Customers with industry leading on-time performance and percentage of completed flights without cancellations.\"Read more CNBC airline newsDelta says government shutdown cost it $200 million, but forecasts strong travel demand into 2026The government shutdown is over.

    "body": "Ray Dalio, founder of Bridgewater, speaking to CNBC at the Future Investment Institute 2025 summit in Riyadh on Oct. 28th, 2025.CNBCThe Middle East is fast emerging as one of the world's most powerful AI hubs, Bridgewater Associates' founder Ray Dalio said Monday, comparing the region's rise to Silicon Valley's pull for all things tech. Speaking to CNBC, Dalio said the United Arab Emirates and its neighbors have combined vast pools of capital with an influx of global talent, creating a magnet for investment managers and AI innovators alike.The UAE and Saudi Arabia have this year launched multibillion-dollar initiatives to build cloud, data centers and other AI infrastructure, underpinned by sovereign-wealth capital and global tech partnerships. A $10 billion agreement between Google Cloud and Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund announced this year aims to create a \"global AI hub\" in the country, as part of a broader push to host data-centers and AI workloads locally.Earlier this year, technology giants OpenAI, Oracle, Nvidia and Cisco combined forces to build a major Stargate artificial intelligence campus in the United Arab Emirates.When asked if he thinks that the UAE, Saudi Arabia and Qatar can be leaders in the AI race, Dalio said, \"What they've done is to create talented people. So this [region] is kind of becoming a Silicon Valley of capitalists ... So now people are coming in … money is coming in, talent is coming in.\"watch nowDalio, who has been visiting Abu Dhabi for more than three decades, said the Gulf's transformation is the result of deliberate statecraft and long-term planning. He described the UAE as \"a paradise in a world that's troubled,\" citing its leadership, stability, quality of life and ambition to build a globally competitive financial ecosystem.\"There's a buzz here, the way there's a buzz in San Francisco, places like that, about AI or technology. It's very similar to that,\" Dalio said.'Precarious' next two yearsThe Bridgewater founder warned that the global economy was headed toward an uncertain future in the near term due to a confluence of multiple forces, reiterating his concerns about markets being in bubble.  \"The next year or two in the future is going to be more precarious,\" he said, pointing to the convergence of what he calls the three dominant cycles: debt, U.S. political conflict and geopolitics.The global debt overhang is already forcing stress into pockets of the market.\"We're seeing cracks in the markets in a number of ways, private equity, venture capital, debt that's being refinanced, and all of those. So we are in a bubble, I believe, by almost all of those measures,\" Dalio said, highlighting similarities with the 2000 bubble but not the one in 1929.He also expects U.S. politics to become more disruptive heading into 2026. \"As we go into the 2026 elections … you will see a lot more conflict in different ways,\" Dalio said, adding that elevated interest rates and concentrated market leadership compound the vulnerability.\"Every country … cannot continue to accumulate the debt they have, yet politically they can't raise taxes and they can't cut benefits. So they're stuck.\" That fiscal bind feeds into a broader rise in domestic polarization: \"We now have populism of the left and populism of the right … which means irreconcilable differences.\"Dalio reiterated his view that the AI rally is in bubble territory, but advised investors not to rush for exits just because valuations are stretched.Concerns about an AI bubble have been swirling in recent months, with notable voices such as OpenAI CEO Sam Altman suggesting that the AI market was in a bubble. Investor Michael Burry, who called the 2008 subprime mortgage crash, has forecast the artificial intelligence market bubble could collapse in the next two years. \"All the bubbles took place in times of great technological change,\" Dalio said. \"You don't want to get out of it just because of the bubble. You want to look for the pricking of the bubble.\"The catalyst for that \"pricking,\" he said, usually comes from a tightening of money or a forced need to sell wealth to meet obligations. He also warned of stress in venture capital, private equity and commercial real estate, sectors where cheap debt is now rolling over at higher rates. ",

    "body": "Ben Powell, chief strategist for Middle East and Asia Pacific at BlackRock Investment Institute, at the Abu Dhabi Finance Week (ADFW) conference.Bloomberg | Getty ImagesThe wave of capital pouring into artificial intelligence infrastructure is far from peaking, said Ben Powell, chief investment strategist for APAC at BlackRock, arguing the sector's \"picks and shovels\" suppliers — from chipmakers to energy producers and copper-wire manufacturers — remain the clearest winners as hyperscalers race to outspend one another.The surge in AI-related capital expenditure shows no sign of slowing as tech giants push aggressively to secure an edge in what they see as a winner-takes-all contest, Powell told CNBC Monday on the sidelines of the Abu Dhabi Finance Week.\"The capex deluge continues. The money is very, very clear,\" he said, adding that BlackRock is focused on what he called a \"traditional picks and shovels capex super boom, which still feels like it's got more to go.\" AI infrastructure has been one of the biggest drivers of global investment this year, fueling a broader market rally, even as some investors question how long the boom can last.Nvidia, whose GPU chips are the backbone of the AI revolution, became the first company to briefly surpass $5 trillion in market capitalization amid a dizzying AI-fueled market rally that sparked talk of an AI bubble. Microsoft and OpenAI also reached a restructuring deal in October to support the ChatGPT developer's fundraising efforts. OpenAI has reportedly been preparing for an initial public offering that could value the company at $1 trillion, according to Reuters.The build-out has set off long-term procurement efforts across the tech sector, from chip supply agreements to power commitments. Grid operators from the U.S. to the Middle East are racing to meet soaring electricity demand from new data centers. Companies, including Amazon and Meta, have budgeted tens of billions of dollars annually for AI-related investments.S&P Global estimates data-center power demand could nearly double by 2030, mostly driven by hyperscale, enterprise and leased facilities, along with crypto-mining sites.'Dipping toes into credit market' Powell also noted that leading tech firms have only begun to tap capital markets to fund the next phase of AI expansion, suggesting additional capital is on the way. watch now\"The big companies have only just started dipping their toes into the credit markets… feels like there's a lot more they can do there,\" he said.  The \"hyperscalers\" are behaving as if coming second would effectively leave them out of the market, Powell said. That mindset, he added, has pushed firms to accelerate spending even at the risk of overshooting.  Much of that capital, Powell noted, is likely to flow to the companies powering the AI build-out rather than model developers, reinforcing a growing view among global investors that the most durable gains from the AI boom may lie in the hardware, energy and infrastructure ecosystems behind the technology.\"If we're the recipients of that cash flow, I guess that's a pretty good place to be, whether you're making chips, whether you're making energy all the way down to the copper wiring,\" Powell noted, expecting \"positive surprises driving those stocks in the year ahead.\"",

David Dee Delgado | Getty Images Entertainment | Getty ImagesThe latest report on inflation, delayed by the government shutdown, showed consumer prices rising 3% year-over-year in September, including a 3.1% uptick in cost for food at home. As rising prices continue to affect consumers, President Donald Trump has pushed back on the idea that Americans are struggling financially. \"The word 'affordability' is a con job by the Democrats,\" Trump said during a cabinet meeting on Tuesday. \"The word 'affordability' is a Democrat scam.\"Lately, voters have expressed frustration with Trump's handling of the economy.

    "body": "Dr. Vicky Pebsworth, from left, Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor Retsef Levi, Case Western Reserve University Professor Catherine Stein and Dr. Raymond Pollak, listen to presentations during an Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) meeting to discuss childhood vaccine schedule changes at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, Georgia, U.S., December 4, 2025.Alyssa Pointer | ReutersHealth and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s handpicked vaccine committee voted on Friday to do away with the long-standing, universal recommendation that all babies receive a hepatitis B shot at birth, issuing weaker guidance for certain infants. The group, called the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, or ACIP, recommended that parents use individual decision-making in consultation with a health-care provider to determine when or if to give the hepatitis B birth dose to a baby whose mother tested negative for the virus. For babies who don't receive the birth dose, the committee recommended that they wait to receive a first vaccine until they are at least 2 months old. The acting director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention still has to sign off on that new recommendation. The CDC currently recommends that every baby get vaccinated against hepatitis B within 24 hours of birth, regardless of their mother's testing status. The move overturns that guidance, which has been credited with driving down infections in children by 99% since it was first introduced three decades ago and is widely considered to be a public health success story. Some committee members and public health experts warn that the change could have wide-ranging consequences, such as an increase in infections among kids. The vote only affects the timing of the first dose of the hepatitis B vaccine series. The second would still be given one to two months after birth, with a third dose between 6 and 18 months of age. All pregnant people are supposed to be tested for hepatitis B during pregnancy. During previous meetings, some advisors questioned the need for babies to receive a shot if their mothers test negative. But test results can produce false negatives, some people become infected later in pregnancy after being tested and babies can get infected by other members of their household. The panel's closely watched two-day meeting in Atlanta comes after Kennedy gutted the committee and appointed 12 new members, including some well-known vaccine critics. ACIP sets recommendations on who should receive certain shots and which vaccines insurers must cover at no cost. Eight members voted yes, while three voted no. Some advisors strongly pushed back on the new guidance ahead of the vote. \"This has a great potential to cause harm, and I hope that the committee accepts the responsibility when this harm is caused,\" said Dr. Joseph Hibbeln, psychiatrist and voting member. Dr. Cody Meissner, voting member and professor of pediatrics at the Dartmouth Geisel School of Medicine, said he hopes that pediatricians will continue to administer the birth dose within the first 24 hours of delivery and before discharge from the hospital. \"To follow any other course is not in the interest of infants,\" he said. Meissner added that more children will be injured and will catch hepatitis B infections. Hepatitis B, which can be passed from mother to baby during childbirth, can lead to liver disease and early death. Infants are more vulnerable to developing chronic hepatitis B infections, which have no cure. \"We will see hepatitis B come back,\" he said. \"The vaccine is so effective. It does not make sense in my mind to change the immunization schedule.\"In a statement Friday, the American Medical Association said the vote is \"reckless and undermines decades of public confidence in a proven, lifesaving vaccine.\" The group added that the decision was not based on scientific evidence and \"creates confusion for parents about how best to protect their newborns.\"Meanwhile, Retsef Levi, a voting member and Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor, falsely claimed during meetings that experts have \"never tested\" the hepatitis B vaccine \"appropriately.\" Some committee members raised concerns about vaccinating during the so-called neonatal period, which is a critical window of development for the brain and immune system. But decades of evidence show that the hepatitis B shot has been safely administered to newborns. Other advisors said there is no evidence supporting the two-month delay to the birth dose.\"We have to make decisions with the data that we have, and we must use only the credible data to make the decisions, and not speculations and not hypotheses,\" said Hibbeln. A 2024 CDC study showed that the current vaccination schedule has helped prevent more than 6 million hepatitis B infections and nearly 1 million hepatitis B-related hospitalizations.Merck and GSK manufacture the hepatitis B vaccines used starting at birth. Neither of the shots are significant revenue drivers for the companies, so the new recommendations should not have a material impact on their businesses. Still, Merck said in a statement Friday that it is \"deeply concerned\" by the vote, which it said risks \"reversing this progress and puts infants at unnecessary risk of chronic infection, liver cancer and even death.\" The company added that \"there is no evidence delaying it provides any benefit to children.\" In a statement, GSK said, \"we await additional information and an official adoption of today's recommendations by CDC to fully understand the potential impact.\"The panel's vote will not affect insurance coverage for the shots, including under Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program, Andrew Johnson, principal policy analyst for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid, told the members during the meeting.

    "body": "Yoon Suk Yeol, South Korea's president, arrives for a hearing at the Constitutional Court of Korea in Seoul, South Korea, on Tuesday, Jan. 21, 2025. Bloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesSouth Korea's special prosecutor has requested the death penalty for former President Yoon Suk Yeol over his short-lived martial law declaration in 2024. The request came as Yoon's trial wrapped up late Tuesday. The court is expected to deliver its ruling on Feb. 19. Yoon has been charged with leading an insurrection, a crime that is not shielded by presidential immunity and carries the maximum penalty of death. If carried out, it would be South Korea's first execution in almost 30 years.Amnesty International has classified the country as \"abolitionist in practice,\" noting that while South Korea still retains the death penalty, it has not executed anyone since 1997.During the final hearing, special counsel Cho Eun-suk's team said that Yoon declared martial law \"with the purpose of remaining in power for a long time by seizing the judiciary and legislature,\" according to South Korean media reports. Yoon reportedly maintained his innocence, saying the declaration was within his constitutional authority and was intended to \"safeguard freedom and sovereignty.\"At the time, Yoon accused the then-opposition Democratic Party of Korea of engaging in \"anti-state activities\" and colluding with \"North Korean communists.\"On Dec 3, 2024, Yoon ordered troops to the country's National Assembly after declaring martial law in a late-night address. Soldiers blocked access and clashed with protesters and lawmakers as special forces attempted to enter the chamber.But within three hours, the martial law order was overturned after 190 of the 300 National Assembly lawmakers managed to gather in the chamber and unanimously voted to overturn the decree. Yoon eventually lifted martial law about six hours after announcing it.The last military coup in South Korea occurred in 1979, when the then-army general Chun Doo-hwan seized control following the assassination of President Park Chung-hee.Chun later expanded martial law nationwide in 1980, a move that led to the 1980 Gwangju uprising, during which troops violently suppressed protests in the southwestern city of Gwangju that left anywhere between 200 and 2,000 civilians killed. At the time, Chun's government accused the uprising of being instigated by \"North Korean communists and gangsters.\"In 1996, Chun was handed the death penalty for his role in the 1979 coup, though his sentence was later commuted to life imprisonment.",

    "body": "When it comes to identifying great ideas, billionaire Barry Diller has a simple piece of advice: Don't be a cynic.Diller is a big fan of \"creative conflict\" group brainstorming sessions, he said in an interview for an episode of CNBC's \"Leaders Playbook,\" set to air on Wednesday. In a creative conflict setting, team members passionately argue about an idea, weighing differing opinions for however long it takes to reach a decision. It can be \"loud and argumentative ... and somewhat brutal,\" but \"I think it's a great environment,\" he said.For group brainstorming to work effectively, resulting in top-tier ideas, you'll need to genuinely consider other people's opinions, said Diller, chairman and senior executive of holding company IAC and travel technology company Expedia Group.\"You have to try and be naive,\" said Diller, 83, who also co-founded the Fox Broadcasting Company. \"You cannot be cynical. Cynicism kills everything. You have to force naivete.\"DON'T MISS: How to build custom GPTs and use AI agentsIf you're cynical, you may think your team member is pitching an idea that only benefits them — or that since you've been at your organization the longest, you naturally know more than the next person.Instead of being dismissive, go into these ideation sessions with a beginner's attitude, said Diller, who has an estimated net worth of $5.5 billion, according to Forbes. That doesn't mean being foolish, ignorant or easily steamrolled — rather, you're open to fresh perspectives, learning something new and being challenged.\"I've always held on to being a dopey naive as much as I can,\" said Diller. \"You know, as you go through life, you just get more sophisticated and the natural tendencies get more cynical. If you want to use your instincts, you have to brush that clean every day practically.\"How listening can help you make difficult decisionsThe value of considering your colleagues' unconventional ideas can go beyond brainstorming.In the interview, Diller discussed IAC's purchase of a majority stake in Expedia. In July 2001, Diller made a deal to buy a 75% stake in Expedia for about $1 billion. Two months later, before the deal was completed, the September 11 terrorist attacks halted U.S. travel almost entirely.Expedia had \"zero revenue for a while, and it came back relatively quickly, but at that critical moment, when we had to make the decision, there was no business,\" said Diller. \"Several people said, 'This is not the time to pay over a billion dollars for something that, right now, is so completely unpredictable' ... But someone in the room, when we were talking about this, at the height of the argument, said, 'If there's life, there's travel.'\"\"As soon as I heard it, I said, 'Close [the deal]. I'm betting on that if there's life, there's travel ... and if there isn't life, then who cares anyway?' And that was it. It was very binary.\"Diller's IAC finally acquired Expedia in August 2003, and Diller helped steer the company through the Great Recession and the Covid-19 pandemic. Expedia Group now owns and operates several other travel sites including Hotels.com, Vrbo, Travelocity and Trivago, and currently has a $36.44 billion market cap.Watch Barry Diller on CNBC's \"Leaders Playbook″ on Wednesday, Jan. 14 at 10:30 p.m. ET/PT. All new episodes Wednesdays.Want to get ahead at work with AI?

    "body": "Warren Buffett and Greg Abel walkthrough the Berkshire Hathaway Annual Shareholders Meeting in Omaha, Nebraska on May 3, 2025. David A. Grogen | CNBCIn the final stretch of his tenure atop Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett was still pursuing that elusive elephant.The 95-year-old legendary investor, who handed over the CEO reins to Greg Abel at the start of 2026, made it clear that deal size was not the constraint, it was lack of opportunities.\"It's external circumstances. Believe me if after we get finished talking you say, 'I've got a great $100 billion new idea.' I would say, 'Let's talk,'\" Buffett told Becky Quick in a special interview in May after he said he was stepping down at the end of the year. The never-before-seen interview is part of the \"Warren Buffett: A Life and Legacy\" special airing Tuesday at 7 p.m. ET. on CNBC. The remarks underscore a central paradox at Berkshire today. The company is awash in liquidity, with its cash hoard swelling to a record $381.6 billion at the end of the third quarter, but Buffett found no opportunities in 2025 large enough to move the needle at prices he considers sensible.\"It means that when I look at the stock market, when I look at companies of a size that would make any difference to our total, I don't see anything. Well, we're buying one or two things, but it's peanuts. But I'm willing to spend $100 billion this afternoon, you know,\" Buffett, now chairman, told CNBC.In October, Berkshire closed a deal to buy Occidental Petroleum's chemical business, OxyChem, for $9.7 billion in cash, marking its largest purchase since 2022, when it paid $11.6 billion for insurer Alleghany.Berkshire's cash has grown significantly after Buffett aggressively dumped enormous pieces of his two largest holdings, Apple and Bank of America. Buffett doesn't want to be sitting on this much cash. He has long warned that cash is a poor long-term asset, even as he insists on holding ample reserves to weather unforeseen shocks.\"I'd rather have $100 billion and a really good business at a sensible price than have $100 billion in cash,\" he said. \"At certain levels, cash is necessary, but cash is not a good asset.\"He likened liquidity to oxygen, cheap to maintain and catastrophic to run out of at the wrong moment.\"You always want to have enough,\" Buffett said. \"You don't have to pay a lot for it. But you do need oxygen. And cash is that way. You always need to have it available because you do not know what will happen. I do not know what the stock market will do, and I do not know what business will do.\"Abel has been a longtime lieutenant who played a central role in several of Berkshire's acquisitions particularly in energy, and helped transform Berkshire Hathaway Energy into a powerhouse.While Abel's deal-making credentials are established, Berkshire shareholders may not extend him the same patience they have long afforded Buffett. With the conglomerate sitting on a mountain of cash and shares underperforming the market, pressure to deploy capital could quickly become a defining challenge for the new CEO.",

    "body": "President Donald Trump speaks at the Detroit Economic Club in Detroit, Jan. 13, 2026.Evelyn Hockstein | ReutersAs the Justice Department continues its investigation into the Federal Reserve, the next front in the central bank's quest to maintain political independence shifts to the Supreme Court. On Jan. 21, the high court will hear arguments related to President Donald Trump's efforts to fire Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook.Administration officials last year accused Cook of committing mortgage fraud by misrepresenting which property was her primary residence on mortgage applications. Trump tried to remove Cook from her position but thus far has been prevented by courts. Should the White House win the case, it could set an important precedent for the president's ongoing attempt to oust Fed Chair Jerome Powell.\"If the Court rules against Cook, that would significantly raise the probability that Powell could also be removed based on the DoJ investigation,\" Bank of America economist Aditya Bhave said in a note. \"We have been arguing that the Cook case is more important for the policy trajectory than the identity of the next Fed Chair. We think that's even more true now.\"The stakes were raised in the Fed saga when Powell announced Sunday that he'd been served with Justice Department subpoenas regarding a controversial multimillion-dollar renovation project at the central bank's headquarters in Washington. The probe reportedly focuses on whether Powell lied about the project during congressional testimony last year.Trump has been a fierce Powell critic and toyed last year with the idea of firing him. Powell has insisted that Trump can't remove him, but if the president can establish cause, that could change. On the surface, the effort to remove Powell seems academic: His term as chair expires in May and Trump then is free to submit a new nominee. However, Powell's term on the Board of Governors runs into 2028, meaning he could stay on and be an obstacle to Trump's efforts to get the Fed to lower rates \"MEANINGFULLY!!!,\" as he stated in a social media post Tuesday.However, it also could provide further incentive for Powell to serve out his term on the board as a bulwark against Trump's efforts to thwart the Fed's independence from political manipulation. For his part, Powell has mostly resisted commenting on Trump's criticism, which has been intensely personal and biting at times. While other presidents have tried to coerce the Fed into easing policy, Trump stands alone in how public and aggressive he has been. Moreover, this is the first time the Justice Department ever has gone after a sitting Fed chair.Longer-term consequencesThe circumstances could add up to a prolonged battle in which Powell decides to stay on, several analysts say.Deutsche Bank drew parallels between Powell and former Fed Chair Marriner Eccles — whose name is now on a Fed building — who decided to stay on as governor after President Harry Truman removed him in 1948. Eccles stayed on as governor until 1951 and was a voice in favor of central bank independence.Moreover, a revolt within the Federal Open Market Committee, which sets interest rates for the Fed, even could see Powell maintained as chair though Trump could name a separate chair to run the central bank itself.\"While this was never a base case, and indeed it seemed like a relatively remote possibility, this weekend's events likely increase the probability that Powell could choose to remain at the Fed,\" Deutsche Bank chief U.S. economist Matthew Luzzetti said in a client note. \"Indeed, if the administration insists on following through with a criminal prosecution of Chair Powell, and Senate Republicans stand firm in not advancing nominees to the Federal Reserve Board, it is likely the FOMC would choose Powell to remain on as chair.\"That circles back to the Cook hearing. Should Trump prevail, he could use it as justification to remove Powell. Should Cook win, it sets up a protracted battle of wills between the Fed and White House that could have important policy implications.Markets are watching for clues about the Fed's moves, with traders betting heavily against any action at the policy meeting later this month. Instead, they see the next cut not coming until June, according to CME Group data.The Cook decision \"will carry immense weight when it comes to any president's ability to shape the structure of the Fed,\" wrote Kevin Gordon, head of macro research and strategy at Charles Schwab. \"Make no mistake, though: Even though the magnitude of various markets' moves in response to the Powell news has been limited, the direction (dollar down, stocks down, bonds down) is indicative of how these shocks are to be digested if they persist over the long term.\"",

Cfoto | Future Publishing | Getty ImagesChina's exports growth in December sharply beat expectations, catapulting the annual trade surplus to a record high, while imports rose at their fastest pace in three months. Exports surged 6.6% in U.S. dollar terms last month from a year earlier, Chinese customs data showed Wednesday, topping analysts' median estimate for a 3% growth and accelerating from a 5.9% jump in November.Imports rose 5.7% in December from a year earlier, topping expectations for a 0.9% growth — strongest since September last year when they climbed 7.4%, according to LSEG data.   China's exports for the full year grew 5.5% while imports stayed flat, taking Beijing's trade surplus to $1.19 trillion, up 20% from 2024.  Shipments to the U.S. plunged 30% in December from a year ago — declining for a ninth straight month — while imports from the country dropped 29%, customs data showed.  Signaling a sharp drop in trade with the U.S. in 2025 amid tariff tensions, China's exports to the country dropped 20% while imports declined 14.6%. Lv Daliang, spokesperson for China's customs authority, told reporters Wednesday that bilateral trade relations should be \"mutually-beneficial.\"  As Chinese exporters have ramped up shipments to non-U.S. markets, the growing trade imbalance has prompted concerns from major trading partners, including the European Union. International Monetary Fund Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva in a December press conference urged Beijing to shift away from relying on exports for growth and accelerate its push to boost domestic consumption.    China's trade surplus is going to have “as destructive an impact on the global trading system as Trump's tariffs,” said Eswar Prasad, a senior fellow at Brookings Institution, as the country's sluggish domestic demand drags down global growth.  Nations around the world are likely to seek protection for their own economies by erecting trade barriers, Prasad cautioned. Chinese officials in December pledged to expand imports and work toward balancing trade. China's exports to the European Union and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations rose 12% and 11%, respectively, in December, while imports from the European nations expanded 18% and fell 5% from Southeast Asian countries.Zhiwei Zhang, president and chief economist at Pinpoint Asset Management, expects Beijing to keep the macro policy stance unchanged at least in the first quarter, as strong export growth helps mitigate soft domestic demand and trade tensions with the U.S. have eased.China and U.S. in October agreed to roll back a series of export-control measures and higher tariffs in a 1-year trade truce, following a meeting between Chinese President Xi Jinping and his American counterpart Donald Trump.  China is set to release next Monday its annual and fourth-quarter gross domestic product data. Economists polled by Reuters expected the world's second largest economy to have expanded 4.5% in the final quarter. Beijing had set it growth target for 2025 at around 5%.       The nearly $19 trillion economy has struggled to shake off deflationary pressure as a deepening real estate collapse has weighed on household demand and a weak job market has clouded consumer confidence. Consumer prices in the country stayed flat in 2025, missing the official target of around 2% increase.  ",

Bloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesGlobal central bankers issued a statement Tuesday defending U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell following the launch of a criminal investigation into the central bank chief. \"We stand in full solidarity with the Federal Reserve System and its Chair Jerome H. Powell,\" central bank chiefs including European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde and Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey, said in a joint statement. \"The independence of central banks is a cornerstone of price, financial and economic stability in the interest of the citizens that we serve. It is therefore critical to preserve that independence, with full respect for the rule of law and democratic accountability,\" they added.Powell has served with \"integrity, focused on his mandate and an unwavering commitment to the public interest,\" the statement said. \"To us, he is a respected colleague who is held in the highest regard by all who have worked with him.\"Other signatories to the statement included the central bank chiefs of Brazil, Switzerland, Sweden, Denmark, South Korea, Australia and Canada.watch nowThe message of solidarity with Powell comes after the Fed chief issued a statement on Sunday evening confirming that federal prosecutors had launched a criminal investigation into the $2.5 billion renovation of the central bank's headquarters in Washington, D.C., and his related testimony to Congress.Powell, who has come under sustained pressure from U.S. President Donald Trump to lower interest rates, said the probe was the result of the president's frustration to cut rates as quickly and as much as he wanted.\"The threat of criminal charges is a consequence of the Federal Reserve setting interest rates based on our best assessment of what will serve the public, rather than following the preferences of the President,\" Powell said in a video statement tweeted by the Fed's X account.Powell warned that the outcome of the investigation will determine the future of the central bank's decisions.\"This is about whether the Fed will be able to continue to set interest rates based on evidence and economic conditions — or whether instead monetary policy will be directed by political pressure or intimidation,\" Powell said. — CNBC's Dan Mangan contributed reporting to this story.

David Ryder | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesBoeing logged net orders for 1,173 airplanes last year, marking the first time it outsold its European rival Airbus since 2018, the latest sign of Boeing's recovery.Boeing handed over 63 jetliners to customers last month, bringing its annual delivery total to 600 aircraft, the most in seven years, before two deadly crashes and a host of other problems derailed its output. Forty-four of those deliveries were 737 Maxes, Boeing said Tuesday.Airbus still delivered more aircraft last year than Boeing, with 793, though that sum is below the record 863 airplanes the European manufacturer handed over in 2019. Airbus had 889 net orders for 2025.Engine and other supply chain issues continue to hold up aircraft deliveries. Deliveries are key for airplane manufacturers because airlines pay the bulk of a jet's price when they receive the plane.Boeing's net orders last month totaled 174 planes, including more than 100 737 Maxes for Alaska Airlines, which the Seattle carrier announced last week. Delta Air Lines earlier Tuesday said it ordered at least 30 Boeing 787 Dreamliners, its first for the wide-body plane.

    "body": "German Chancellor Friedrich Merz (CDU) gives a press statement on the sidelines of his visit to the Bosch company. This is the last stop on his trip to India.Picture Alliance | Picture Alliance | Getty ImagesGerman Chancellor Friedrich Merz on Tuesday said the embattled Iranian regime appears to be finished as mass protests continue across the country. Speaking to reporters during his visit to India, Merz renewed calls for Iranian authorities to end their violence against demonstrators, adding that he hopes for a peaceful end to the escalating crisis. \"If a regime can only keep itself in power by force, then it's effectively at the end. I believe we are now seeing the final days and weeks of this regime,\" Merz said, in comments reported by Sky News. \"In any case, it has no legitimacy through elections in the population. The population is now rising up against this regime,\" he added. Merz's comments come as Iran grapples with one of the most widespread anti-government demonstrations in years. The Iranian government has claimed the prolonged protests are now under control, while human rights groups have reported that hundreds have been killed by Iranian security forces in recent weeks. A spokesperson for Iran's embassy in London did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Read moreU.S. President Donald Trump, who said Monday that any country doing business with Iran will face a 25% tariff, has repeatedly threatened to take military action against Iran if the killings continue.The demonstrations, which began in Tehran's bazaar on Dec. 28, have been fueled by growing frustrations over a long-running economic crisis, particularly the government's handling of a sharp fall in the nation's currency and soaring prices.Speaking on Friday, Iran's supreme leader lashed out at anti-government protesters, saying they were \"vandals\" acting on behalf of Trump by destroying public properties.In a broadcast on national television, reported by Reuters, Ali Khamenei warned Tehran would not tolerate \"mercenaries for foreigners.\"\"The Islamic Republic came to power through the blood of hundreds of thousands of honorable people. It will not back down in the face of vandals,\" Khamenei said.Trump administration closely monitoring Iran situationIran, which is a member of OPEC, is a major player in the global oil market. Crude futures were trading higher on Tuesday morning as investors assessed the impact of potential supply disruptions. Jacob Helberg, U.S. Under Secretary of State for Economic Affairs, said the Trump administration is monitoring the situation in Iran \"very closely\" but has yet to deliberate on how it is going to respond.watch now\"For decades, the Iranian regime has neglected its economy, its agriculture, its water, and its electricity in order to squander Iran's vast wealth on terrorist proxies and nuclear weapons research,\" Helberg told CNBC's \"Access Middle East\" on Tuesday.\"Ultimately, their future is in the Iranian people's hands. The United States, as President Trump has made clear, will not tolerate massacres in the streets,\" he added.",

    "body": "Dado Ruvic | ReutersJPMorgan Chase CFO Jeremy Barnum hinted Tuesday the industry could fight President Donald Trump's demand for credit card price controls, saying \"everything's on the table.\" \"If you wind up with weakly supported directives to radically change our business that aren't justified, you have to assume that everything's on the table,\" Barnum said on a call with reporters following JPMorgan's fourth-quarter earnings report. \"We owe that to shareholders.\"Barnum was responding to a question about whether banks would choose to litigate to block Trump's demand, made late Friday, that card companies cap interest rates at 10% for a year. Last year, the industry successfully fought efforts by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to cap card late fees.Banks and industry insiders say that an interest rate limit would result in fewer credit card accounts for Americans and a dip in spending for the U.S. economy, as companies would simply pull accounts rather than offer them at an unprofitable level.The average credit card rate nationally is 19.7% as of this month, according to a weekly survey from Bankrate.com, while rates for subprime borrowers and store-specific cards are typically higher.\"Our belief is that actions like this will have the exact opposite consequence to what the administration wants for consumers,\" Barnum said. \"Instead of lowering the price of credit, we'll simply reduce the supply of credit, and that will be bad for everyone: consumers, the wider economy, and yes, at the margin, for us.\"The CFO declined to directly answer a question on whether JPMorgan would comply with Trump's demand, which has a proposed Jan. 20 start date. Banks that don't follow the directive are \"in violation of the law,\" Trump told reporters Sunday.Still, it's unclear how Trump's mandate would be enforced. There is no U.S. law capping card rates, though a bill was introduced last year from Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri and Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont that would limit card APRs at 10% for five years. That bill is stalled in Congress.Other voices in the corporate and political realms began addressing the possible impact of Trump's rate cap on Tuesday. Beyond banks, airlines and retailers rely on revenue from card partnerships to bolster profit. For instance, Delta Air Lines said Tuesday that its American Express partnership produced $8.2 billion in revenue last year.Delta CEO Ed Bastian said on an earnings call that the cap would \"upend the whole credit card industry ... I don't see any way we could even begin to contemplate how that would be implemented.\"House Speaker Mike Johnson struck a note of caution when asked about the issue at a news conference.\"We have a lot of work to go [on] consensus around it, but you got to be very careful as we go forward in that in our zeal to bring down costs — you don't want to have negative secondary effects,\" Johnson said. — CNBC's Emily Wilkins and Leslie Josephs contributed to this report.  watch now",

    "body": "watch nowCore U.S. consumer prices rose less than predicted in December, reinforcing hopes that inflation is tempering as the Federal Reserve contemplates its next move on interest rates.Excluding volatile food and energy prices, the consumer price index showed a seasonally adjusted 0.2% gain on a monthly basis and 2.6% annually, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported Tuesday. Both were 0.1 percentage point below expectations. Though they look at both measures, Fed officials consider core inflation a better long-run gauge of where inflation is heading.On a headline basis, the CPI posted an increase of 0.3% for the month, putting the all-items annual rate at 2.7%. Both were exactly in line with the Dow Jones consensus estimate.The Fed targets inflation at 2% annually, so the report provides some evidence that the pace of price increases is moving back to target but remains elevated.Stock market futures briefly rose following the report while Treasury yields were lower. Traders kept bets intact that the Fed would stand pat at its meeting later this month and likely won't be considering another cut until June, according to the CME Group's FedWatch gauge.President Donald Trump used the CPI report to renew his calls on Fed Chair Jerome Powell and his colleagues to ease monetary policy.\"Great (LOW!) Inflation numbers for the USA. That means that Jerome 'Too Late' Powell should cut interest rates, MEANINGFULLY!!!,\" Trump posted on Truth Social. \"If he doesn't he will just continue to be 'TOO LATE!'\"Shelter, a key element of stickiness, increased 0.4%, which was the biggest item for the monthly increase, according to the BLS. The category accounts for more than one-third of the CPI weighting and was up 3.2% on an annual basis.Other parts of the report also showed inflation persisting.Food prices jumped 0.7% for the month, though egg prices tumbled 8.2% and fell nearly 21% from a year ago after soaring previously. Other areas seeing increases included recreation, airfares and medical care. Energy prices rose 0.3% on the month and were up 2.3% from a year ago, though gasoline declined 0.5% and 3.4%, respectively.Some tariff-sensitive categories including apparel, also posted gains. However, household furnishings saw a 0.5% decrease as President Donald Trump backed off on threatened tariff increases for imports in that sector.The 1.2% increase for recreation was the largest monthly gain ever for the index in data going back to 1993, the BLS said.The report likely keeps the central bank on hold at least for the moment. Policymakers cut their benchmark rate three times in the latter part of 2025, and markets expect them to stay on hold through the first half of the new year as they assess the impact of the cuts on general economic conditions.\"We've seen this movie before — inflation isn't reheating, but it remains above target,\" wrote Ellen Zentner, chief economic strategist at Morgan Stanley Wealth Management. \"There's still only modest pass-through from tariffs, but housing affordability isn't thawing. Today's inflation report doesn't give the Fed what it needs to cut interest rates later this month.\"Fed officials currently are weighing risks to the labor market against the potential for inflation to linger. Trump's tariffs have added another wrinkle to the equation, though most policymakers see the impact on inflation as temporary.Some areas of the report, particularly in goods, showed signs of deflation. Used cars and trucks declined 1.1% and the communication index slipped 1.9%. New vehicle prices were flat.Tuesday's release brings the BLS current on inflation and employment after the government shutdown last year caused a suspension of data collection and reports. Figuring in the December price increase, real wages were flat for the month and up 1.1% from a year ago, the BLS said in a separate report.",

    "body": "watch nowPresident Donald Trump on Tuesday slammed Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell as either \"incompetent\" or \"crooked,\" even as his Department of Justice faces growing opposition over its criminal investigation of the central bank leader.Trump threw his latest punch at Powell after being asked whether the unprecedented action undermines confidence in the Fed, which has long enjoyed independence from the executive branch. \"He's billions of dollars over budget,\" Trump said, apparently referencing costs related to a multibillion-dollar renovation of the Fed's Washington headquarters, which is at the center of DOJ's probe.\"So, he either is incompetent or he's crooked,\" Trump told reporters outside the White House. \"I don't know what he is. But he does a – certainly he doesn't do a very good job.\"Trump lobbed more insults at Powell after traveling to Michigan to tour a Ford auto plant and deliver remarks at the Detroit Economic Club.\"That jerk will be gone soon,\" Trump said of Powell during the speech.Trump's comments came as bipartisan criticism of the investigation, and support for the Fed's independence, continue to grow.\"Everyone we know believes in Fed independence,\" JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon told reporters earlier Tuesday after his bank released its fourth-quarter earnings results.\"Anything that chips away at that is probably not a great idea,\" Dimon said. \"And in my view, it will have the reverse consequences, it will raise inflation expectations and probably increase rates over time.\"Trump, brushed Dimon's concerns aside later Tuesday, telling reporters \"I think it's fine what I'm doing\" and calling Powell \"a bad Fed person.\"\"He's done a bad job. We should have lower rates. Jamie Dimon probably wants higher rates. Maybe he makes more money that way,\" Trump said.U.S. President Donald Trump looks at Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell holding a document during a tour of the Federal Reserve Board building, which is currently undergoing renovations, in Washington, D.C., U.S., July 24, 2025. Kent Nishimura | ReutersDimon's remarks echoed similar concerns from a slew of Republican lawmakers, including some who are reliable supporters of Trump.\"If you wanted to design a system to guarantee that interest rates would go up and not down, the best way to do that would be to have the Federal Reserve and the executive branch of the United States get in a pissing contest,\" Senate Banking Committee member John Kennedy, R-La., said Monday.\"We need this like we need a hole in the head,\" he added.Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, meanwhile, expressed concerns to Trump that the DOJ probe could complicate existing plans to confirm the next Fed chair after Powell's term expires in May, CNBC has learned.But U.S. Attorney Jeanine Pirro signaled overnight that her office in Washington, D.C., has no plans to drop its legal effort against the Fed and Powell.\"The United States Attorney's Office contacted the Federal Reserve on multiple occasions to discuss cost overruns and the chairman's congressional testimony, but were ignored, necessitating the use of legal process—which is not a threat,\" Pirro wrote in a post on X.\"The word 'indictment' has come out of Mr. Powell's mouth, no one else's. None of this would have happened if they had just responded to our outreach,\" Pirro wrote.\"This office makes decisions based on the merits, nothing more and nothing less. We agree with the chairman of the Federal Reserve that no one is above the law, and that is why we expect his full cooperation,\" she added.Powell, on Sunday night, said the DOJ served grand jury subpoenas and threatened a \"criminal indictment\" based on his prior Senate testimony about the ongoing renovations of the central bank office buildings.Powell directly connected the probe to Trump's frequent complaints about the Fed lowering interest rates too slowly.\"The threat of criminal charges is a consequence of the Federal Reserve setting interest rates based on our best assessment of what will serve the public, rather than following the preferences of the President,\" he said in a video statement.\"No one, certainly not the chair of the Federal Reserve, is above the law,\" Powell said. \"But this unprecedented action should be seen in the broader context of the administration's threats and ongoing pressure.\"Trump has said the subpoenas have nothing to do with his views on interest rates.\"\"No. I wouldn't even think of doing it that way,\" Trump told NBC News on Sunday night. \"What should pressure him is the fact that rates are far too high. That's the only pressure he's got.\"",

Liselotte Sabroe | Afp | Getty ImagesGreenland Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen said Tuesday that the Arctic island chooses Denmark over the U.S., pushing back against Donald Trump's repeated takeover threats.  \"If we have to choose between the USA and Denmark here and now, we choose Denmark. We choose NATO, the Kingdom of Denmark and the EU,\" Nielsen said, according to translated comments reported by Danish public broadcaster DR.

The defendants also claim that post-employment agreements are \"facially overbroad and unenforceable\" and say Palantir's interpretation is meant to \"stifle competition.\"The lawsuit, originally filed by Palantir in October in the Southern District of New York, accused Percepta co-founder and CEO Hirsh Jain and co-founder Radha Jain of using stolen information to create a \"copycat\" business. Palantir also claimed the founders, who used to work for the data analytics company, attempted to poach talent and \"plunder Palantir's valuable intellectual property.\" Palantir accused a third Percepta employee, Joanna Cohen, of sending herself confidential documents after resigning and photographing sensitive information she downloaded to her personal phone. Percepta in December denied using any of Palantir's confidential information and called the case \"baseless.\"Attorneys said in Monday's filing that in-depth searches did not find any Palantir materials and argued that the screenshots taken by Cohen were done in \"good faith\" to help her complete tasks. They said the materials \"would be useless to Percepta and are by now stale regardless.\"Palantir declined to comment. WATCH: Highlights of DealBook Summit 2025watch now",

    "body": "Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg demonstrates an Oculus Rift virtual reality (VR) headset and Oculus Touch controllers during the Oculus Connect 3 event in San Jose, California, U.S., on Thursday, Oct. 6, 2016.David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesA little over four years after Mark Zuckerberg changed Facebook's name to Meta, reflecting his view that the future of work, play and socializing was going virtual, the company is making a major course correction. Meta this week began laying off employees focused on virtual reality within its Reality Labs division and is shutting down a number of studios that were working on VR titles, according to people familiar with the matter who asked not to be named due to confidentiality. CNBC confirmed a report from the New York Times that layoffs, amounting to more than 1,000 jobs, will impact about 10% of the hardware division, which makes Quest VR headsets, and the Horizon Worlds virtual social network. Andrew Bosworth, Meta's chief technology officer, is slated to hold an all-hands meeting with Reality Labs on Wednesday, some of the people said.Meta is scaling back its metaverse ambitions as the company continues ramping up its investments in artificial intelligence, Zuckerberg's more recent obsession and the technology that's consumed Silicon Valley and the broader industry. Zuckerberg has been paying big bucks for top AI talent, most notably shelling out $14.3 billion in June to hire Scale AI founder Alexandr Wang, who's now leading AI strategy, along with other engineers and researchers from the startup.In October, Vishal Shah, who spent four years leading the company's metaverse efforts, was named vice president of AI products. That month Meta lifted the range of its 2025 capital expenditures to between $70 billion and $72 billion and said dollar growth would be \"notably larger\" in 2026. watch nowThe studios that are closing as part of the latest changes include Armature Studio, Twisted Pixel, and Sanzaru, as well as a technical unit called Oculus Studios Central Technology, sources told CNBC. Jobs are also being cut at other studios including Ouro Interactive, which Meta debuted in 2023 to build first-party content for Horizon Worlds.  Supernatural, a VR fitness app that Meta purchased for $400 million in 2023, was moved into maintenance mode, meaning it will be run by a skeleton crew and no longer receive new content, said people with knowledge of the matter.Meta laid the groundwork for this week's announcement in December, when the company said it would be shifting resources within Reality Labs' budget away from its VR initiatives toward its endeavors with AI glasses and wearable devices. \"This is part of that effort, and we plan to reinvest the savings to support the growth of wearables this year,\" a Meta spokesperson said, without commenting specifically on the layoffs.  While Meta's VR projects have never taken off, the company has had better success in AI-powered wearables, particularly through a partnership with EssilorLuxottica to make Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses.In September, the two companies unveiled the Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses, which cost $799 and contain a single, built-in display that shows users small messages and previews of photos. Meta said last week that it would delay the global debut of the display glasses, citing \"limited\" inventories amid \"unprecedented\" U.S. demand.Luxottica CFO Stefano Grassi said in October that his company will be able to reach the 10 million unit capacity for the glasses that it had originally planned to hit by the end of 2026 earlier than anticipated.More like RobloxDespite the downsizing, Meta isn't abandoning VR. The company is courting developers who build games for Roblox, a virtual world gaming platform popular with kids, to build experiences for Horizon Worlds, sources said. Roblox says it has more than 150 million daily users, while Horizon, which Zuckerberg showcased at the time of the company name change, has never drawn more than a couple hundred thousand active users a month. By taking cues from the likes of Roblox and Minecraft, which Microsoft acquired in 2014, Horizon Worlds could serve as a funnel for Meta to attract a younger audience to its services. Last year Bosworth directed the company to turn Horizon Worlds into a hit smartphone app, after beginning a test of a mobile version in 2023, people familiar with the matter told CNBC. Meta moved employees from other parts of Reality Labs onto the Horizon Worlds team in 2025, ex-employees said.Ben Hatton, an analyst for CCS Insight who covers connected devices, said the underperformance of VR headsets and the continuing growth of mobile forced Meta's hand. \"It kind of follows that Meta will be moving it towards mobile as mobile gaming has become very popular over the last five years or so,\" Hatton said.Ouro is one of the studios that will be working on mobile content for Horizon Worlds, people said. Andrew Bosworth, chief technology officer of Meta Platforms Inc., speaks during a Bloomberg Television interview on the sidelines of the Meta Connect event in Menlo Park, California, US, on Wednesday, Sept. 25, 2024.David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesMeta's decision to scale back its VR efforts comes 12 years after Facebook entered the market with the $2 billion purchase of Oculus VR. Since late 2020, Meta's Reality Labs division has logged over $70 billion in cumulative losses. In its latest quarterly earnings in October, Meta said Reality Labs recorded a $4.4 billion loss on $470 million in sales.Meanwhile, the company is wrestling with a scattershot AI strategy as it tries to keep pace with OpenAI and Google, whose large language models and AI features are soaring in popularity. Meta plans to release its next frontier model, codenamed Avocado, in the first quarter of this year, CNBC reported last month. Meta's stock price badly trailed Alphabet's last year and came up short of the Nasdaq, a trend that's continued in the early days of 2026, with the shares down more than 4% since the calendar changed. Horizon Worlds has been a struggle from the start. In August 2022, 10 months after Zuckerberg announced plans to go all-in on the metaverse, he posted a photo to his Facebook profile showing his avatar in front of animated versions of the Eiffel Tower and Spain's Basílica de la Sagrada Família. The picture was lambasted on social media for its low-quality graphics. Zuckerberg posted a new image days later of an improved version of his avatar, promising users that \"major updates to Horizon and avatar graphics\" were coming soon.But inside Horizon Worlds, the photo fiasco was a defining moment, according to people familiar with the matter. Zuckerberg called a meeting with the team responsible for VR avatars demanding improvements, one of the people said.Multiple VR developers told CNBC that Horizon Worlds usage remains low based on their observations, adding that the company doesn't share specific stats. The developers said they're frustrated because they don't have accurate information that could help them create more compelling games and experiences.Rather, in Meta's refocusing toward a more Roblox-like experience, the company last year began instructing existing third-party Horizon Worlds developers to build kid-friendly, simplistic games.Deepak Nair, a developer advocate at Meta, discussed the strategy in August with an audience of developers in Berlin, encouraging them to mimic Roblox and Minecraft in building games that let kids create stories they can share with their friends. Nair said a key issue for developers is identifying the right demographic. \"Generally 13 to 24, right?\" Nair said. \"And even on other ecosystems, it's even younger than that.\" In February, Meta launched a $50 million Creator Fund intended to entice developers to create more in-game experiences inside Horizon Worlds, with a focus on mobile. The company is planning to make it easy for Facebook and Instagram users to seamlessly access Horizon Worlds, sources said. -- CNBC's Kif Leswing contributed to this report.

Valerie Plesch | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesThe government shutdown stretched into its third week on Wednesday as Republican and Democratic senators continued to dig in their heels on dueling stopgap funding proposals.The Senate on Wednesday for the ninth time rejected a GOP-led short-term funding resolution.In a 51-44 vote, the Senate once again did not approve a stopgap bill, in which Republicans insist on a \"clean\" continuing resolution that would provide funds to reopen the government until at least Nov. 21.Democrats want any funding bill to extend enhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies that are set to run out at the end of this year. That and other provisions in the Democratic bill would cost an estimated $1 trillion.Wednesday's vote occurred days after the Trump administration said in a court filing that more than 4,000 federal employees received notifications that they were being laid off.White House budget director Russell Vought said Wednesday the total could be more than 10,000 job cuts. But shortly after Vought made that remark, a federal judge in San Francisco temporarily blocked the Trump administration from firing federal workers amid the shutdown.Trump administration officials blame the so-called reductions-in-force on Senate Democrats' refusal to vote for the Republican funding proposal.\"Democrats are dug in 15 days into a government shutdown. Democrats show no sign that they're ready for it to end,\" Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., said earlier on Wednesday on the chamber's floor.\"Not even the prospect of military families going without a paycheck was enough for Democrats to reopen the government,\" Thune said.\"Nor are Democrats concerned about needy families uncertain about ... the future of nutrition assistance, or Americans in flood zones who are unable to update their insurance or close on a home in the midst of hurricane season,\" Thune said.Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., countered Thune's argument, saying that the government has been shut since Oct. 1 because Republicans \"refuse to work with Democrats in a serious way to fix the health care crisis looming over the American people.\"\"As we speak, families are receiving letters for their new health insurance rates, and more states, more states are opening their window shopping period for what health insurance will look like next year,\" Schumer said.\"With open enrollment around the corner, Republicans cannot continue to kick this can down the road. It's happening now. The health care crisis is now,\" Schumer said.Thune and other Republicans have said they are willing to discuss the question of extending ACA enhanced tax credits after the short-term funding is approved.\"We need five more Democrats to say enough is enough to put the American people ahead of the far left and to support this clean, nonpartisan continuing resolution sitting right there at the Senate desk, ready to be picked up and passed today,\" said Thune on Wednesday.On Wednesday, President Donald Trump issued a presidential memorandum directing Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to use any remaining congressional funds to keep paying active-duty military personnel.",

    "body": "U.S. Senator Maria Cantwell (D-WA) speaks during a press conference following the weekly policy luncheon, on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C., U.S., June 3, 2025. Annabelle Gordon | ReutersDemocratic Sen. Maria Cantwell on Wednesday asked the U.S. Office of Special Counsel to investigate Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem for \"likely\" violating the Hatch Act by making a video to be shown in airports blaming Democrats for the government shutdown.The Hatch Act bars federal employees, including Cabinet secretaries, from engaging in political activity while acting in their official role.Multiple major airports have refused to show Noem's video near passenger screening lines, including Seattle-Tacoma International Airport in Cantwell's home state of Washington, as well as airports in Chicago and New York.A number of airports specifically mentioned the video's potential violation of the Hatch Act in their decision. The Office of Special Counsel is responsible for investigating potential Hatch Act violations.In a letter to acting Special Counsel Jamieson Greer, Cantwell called out Noem for \"airing a partisan video message — on televisions in public airports across the country — in which she erroneously blames 'Democrats in Congress' for the current government shutdown's impact on airport 'operations' and for Transportation Security Administration ... employees 'working without pay.'\"\"This message is not just false; it appears to violate the prohibitions contained in the Hatch Act,\" wrote Cantwell, who is a member of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation.Cantwell said recent reports indicate that DHS is using taxpayer dollars and federal assets to produce and air the video, in which Noem appears in her official capacity.The letter notes that Noem, in the video, stands in front of an American flag alongside the official insignia of Homeland Security.\"When viewed in its totality, Secretary Noem's video can only be reasonably interpreted as a partisan message intended to misleadingly malign the Trump Administration's political opponents, convince Americans to blame 'Democrats in Congress' for the ongoing government shutdown, and influence their future votes — all while omitting the fact that Republicans currently control the White House, U.S. Senate, and U.S. House of Representatives,\" Cantwell wrote.\"As the independent agency responsible for enforcing the Hatch Act, I urge you to investigate this matter immediately,\" she wrote Greer.DHS didn't immediately respond to a request for comment on Cantwell's letter.A spokesperson for Port of Seattle, which operates the Seattle-Tacoma airport, said Noem's video was not being played \"due to the political nature of the content.\"A spokesperson for Portland International Airport in Oregon told CNBC that the airport \"did not consent to playing the video in its current form, as we believe the Hatch Act clearly prohibits use of public assets for political purposes and messaging.\"",

The airline increased capacity 7% in the third quarter over last year. Unit passenger revenue for the three months ended Sept. 30 fell 3.3% for domestic travel and 7.1% for international. Sales from its lucrative loyalty program rose 9%.In an interview last month, United CEO Scott Kirby last month defended the airline's growth plan and said the carrier was winning loyal customers through its network, new technology like complimentary inflight Wi-Fi, refreshed cabins and new lounges.\"Those investments over almost a decade, combined with great service from our people, have allowed United to win and retain brand-loyal customers, leading to economic resilience even with macro economic volatility through the first three quarters of the year and significant upside as the economy and demand are improving in the fourth quarter,\" Kirby said in a release on Wednesday.Still, for the third quarter, United beat earnings expectations, although its revenue fell short of estimates.Here is what United Airlines reported for the quarter that ended Sept. 30 compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on estimates compiled by LSEG:Earnings per share: $2.78 adjusted vs. $2.62 expectedRevenue: $15.23 billion vs. $15.33 billion expectedUnited's third-quarter revenue was $15.23 billion, up 2.6% from $14.84 billion last year. Net income fell 1.7% to $949 million or $2.90 a share. Adjusting for one-time items including debt, among other things, United posted income of $909 million or $2.78 a share.The carrier is vying with Delta Air Lines to win over more affluent travelers who shell out more for seats, and it has expanded its global network with far-flung destinations like Greenland and Mongolia. United said in the third quarter, its premium-cabin revenue, which includes first class and other, roomier seats, rose 6%. United's sales from no-frills basic economy 4% year-over-year.In the spring and early summer, United and other carriers trimmed their earnings forecasts they made at the start of the year, after passenger demand dipped amid on-again-off-again tariffs, and an oversupply of flights weighed on airfare.",

David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesPresident Donald Trump's tariffs are pushing inflation generally higher as companies are caught between absorbing the costs or passing them onto customers, according to a Federal Reserve report Wednesday.The central bank's periodic Beige Book report, published eight times a year generally at about six-week intervals, categorized overall economic growth as having \"changed little\" since the last report on Sept. 3. Labor markets \"were largely stable\" as demand was \"muted\" for most of the Fed's 12 districts.When it came to prices, though, Trump's duties implemented in April and then staggered through ensuing months showed an impact.\"Prices rose further during the reporting period,\" the report stated. \"Tariff-induced input cost increases were reported across many Districts, but the extent of those higher costs passing through to final prices varied.\"In some cases, firms held prices unchanged to stay competitive and to appease inflation-sensitive clients. However, some businesses said they were \"fully passing higher import costs along to their customers.\"A few districts reported that slowing demand actually pushed prices down for materials.The trade war has escalated in recent days as China has ordered restrictions on coveted rare earths materials, while Trump has retaliated with a threat of 100% tariffs on Chinese imports.The release comes amid a dearth of relevant economic data due to a government shutdown entering its third week. Key providers such as the Labor and Commerce departments are largely closed due to the impasse.However, Bureau of Labor Statistics workers have been called back to release the pivotal consumer price index report used both as an inflation gauge and to index cost of living adjustments for Social Security recipients. The CPI reading, which normally would have been released Wednesday, will come out Oct. 24, the last inflation reading the Fed will get before its policy meeting Oct. 28-29.The Beige Book said consumer spending nudged lower in recent weeks, though it noted \"strong\" spending on luxury items and travel by upper-income earners. Lower and medium earners, meanwhile, pursued discounts and promotions.Future expectations improved in some districts, though Philadelphia reported caution over a prolonged government shutdown.",

    "body": "Albert Bourla, CEO of Pfizer, Charlie Scharf, Wells Fargo & Company CEO and Kathy Warden, Northrop Grumman Chair & CEO speak during the Invest in America Forum on Oct. 15, 2025.Aaron Clamage | CNBCWells Fargo CEO Charlie Scharf and Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla sounded the alarm Wednesday over the potential for the the U.S. to lose its competitive edge to China, but said artificial intelligence could help America maintain its lead.Speaking at CNBC's inaugural Invest in America Forum in Washington, D.C., the two executives said that while the U.S. still leads in many sectors, inconsistent policy and underinvestment is ceding ground to China. AI, they said, poses both risks and benefits for the U.S. economy.Scharf said AI will likely reduce the size of workforces — but will boost productivity.\"We will likely have less people, absolutely,\" Scharf said. \"When we look at the tools that we've implemented just for people that are coding, you see 20%, 30%, 40% improvement in coders. We haven't reduced our head count by 20%, 30% or 40%. We're actually doing more than we otherwise would have been able to do.\"Wells Fargo big bank peers like JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs are already hiring fewer people because of AI advancements.Scharf also said the financial sector is poised for major regulatory changes despite an ongoing political stalemate in Washington.\"We ultimately do expect significant changes in capital requirements, liquidity requirements,\" he said. \"We do expect to see changes which will allow people in the industry, not just big banks and medium-sized banks, but smaller banks as well, to do more in these [local] communities.\"Bourla, meanwhile, expressed concern about China's growing strength in biotechnology and pharmaceuticals, pointing to a surge in research and development spending, regulatory reforms and a national strategy focused on life sciences.\"They [China] filed more patents this year than the U.S.,\" Bourla said. \"That's never happened in history. Five years ago, the split was 90%-10%. ... The gap is closing, but they probably will become [better than us] unless we get our act together.\"Bourla urged the U.S. to shift focus from trying to slow China's progress toward improving its own productivity and innovation.\"We spend more time trying to think about how to slow down China rather than think how we can become better than them,\" Bourla said. \"We need to have regulatory changes here. We need to have stability. Tariffs and pricing was not helping.\"Pfizer recently agreed to a drug pricing deal with the Trump administration as part of a broader effort to remove long-standing uncertainties around pricing, Medicaid reimbursements and distribution. As part of the agreement, Pfizer secured a three-year exemption from pharmaceutical-specific tariffs, contingent on additional investments in U.S. manufacturing. \"Tariffs and the uncertainty of drastic correction of U.S. pricing — with this deal, we are removing both uncertainties,\" Bourla said Wednesday.He also called artificial intelligence the next frontier for medicine, predicting that AI will revolutionize drug discovery by dramatically accelerating timelines for finding treatments for diseases like Alzheimer's and cancer.\"We tried for years to find cures ... AI will make it happen,\" Bourla said.",

Anna Rose Layden | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesA federal judge on Wednesday blocked the Trump administration, for now, from firing federal workers during the ongoing government shutdown.The order came five days after the administration issued reduction-in-force notifications to more than 4,000 federal workers.\"The activities that are being undertaken here are contrary to the laws,\" San Francisco U.S. District Court Judge Susan Yvonne Illston told lawyers for the administration on Wednesday at a hearing where she issued the temporary restraining order.\"You can't do this in a nation of laws,\" Illston said, according to NBC News. \"And we have laws here, and the things that are being articulated here are not within the law.\"The judge cited comments by President Donald Trump and White House Budget Director Russell Vought that have indicated the workers were being laid off explicitly to target programs favored by Democrats.Two unions representing tens of thousands of federal workers had asked Illston to block the RIFs. The Trump administration had warned that it would lay off workers during the shutdown, and President Donald Trump has repeatedly said that the cuts were aimed at \"Democrat agencies\" or initiatives.Shortly before Illston issued her order blocking layoffs, White House Budget Director Russell Vought, during an interview on \"The Charlie Kirk Show,\" said that he expected that \"north of 10,000\" federal jobs would be cut because of their shutdown.Illston said that the Trump administration took \"advantage of the lapse in government spending and government functioning to assume that all bets are off, the laws don't apply to them anymore, and they can impose the structures that they like on the government situation that they don't like,\" according to NBC.The judge also said that she believed the unions would be able to prove that the Trump administration's actions were illegal and \"arbitrary and capricious.\"Illston's order came on the 15th day of the government shutdown, and shortly before a stopgap funding bill that would end the shutdown failed in the Senate for the ninth time.Democracy Forward, an advocacy group representing the unions in court, praised the judge's order.\"The president seems to think his government shutdown is distracting people from the harmful and lawlessness actions of his administration, but the American people are holding him accountable, including in the courts,\" said Skye Perryman, CEO of  Democracy Forward.\"The statements today by the court make clear that the President's targeting of federal workers — a move straight out of Project 2025's playbook — is unlawful,\" Perryman said. \"Our civil servants do the work of the people, and playing games with their livelihoods is cruel and unlawful and a threat to everyone in our nation.\"",

    "body": "watch nowThe Trump administration will set price floors across a range of industries to combat market manipulation by China, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told CNBC in an exclusive interview Wednesday.China has driven foreign competitors in the rare earth industry out of business over the past two decades by using its global dominance in refining and processing to slash prices, Bessent said.\"When you are facing a nonmarket economy like China, then you have to exercise industrial policy,\" Bessent told Sara Eisen at CNBC's Invest in America Forum in Washington, D.C.\"So we're going to set price floors and the forward buying to make sure that this doesn't happen again and we're going to do it across a range of industries,\" the Treasury secretary said, without naming specific industries the administration was looking at beyond rare earths.The U.S. also needs to set up a strategic mineral reserve, Bessent said. JPMorgan Chase is interested in working with the Trump administration to create such a reserve, he said.Rare earths are used to produce magnets that are crucial inputs in U.S. weapons systems like the F-35 warplane and Tomahawk cruise missiles. Rare earth magnets are also essential for civilian commercial applications like electric vehicles.The Trump administration has been working to stand up a domestic rare earth supply chain. The Department of Defense struck an unprecedented deal in July with MP Materials, the largest U.S. rare earth miner, that included an equity stake, a price floor and offtake agreement.China last week announced sweeping new restrictions on rare earth exports ahead of an expected meeting between President Xi Jinping and President Donald Trump in South Korea later this month. Trump has threatened to slap China with additional 100% tariffs in response.The U.S. could take equity stakes in other companies in the wake of Beijing's rare earth restrictions, Bessent told CNBC.\"I wouldn't be surprised,\" the Treasury secretary said when asked about additional equity stakes. \"When we get an announcement like this week with China on the rare earths, you realize we have to be self-sufficient, or we have to be sufficient with our allies.\"The Trump administration will not take stakes in nonstrategic industries, Bessent said. \"We do have to be very careful not to overreach,\" he said.Shares of rare earth and critical mineral miners have rallied over the past several sessions as investors speculate on which companies might be future targets for Trump administration industrial policy.",

The 11-inch iPad Pro starts at $999. The latest Apple Vision Pro, which includes a Dual Knit Band, starts at $3,499.The new devices are available to preorder now in most markets and go on sale Oct. 22. They are Apple's latest additions to its fall catalog of products.The company released the iPhone 17 and Apple Watch Series 11 models in September.Apple's December quarter is its largest by sales, driven by holiday and Christmas shopping. That is why the company usually updates its bestselling products in the fall. This year, it's the first full quarter of iPhone 17 sales as well.The new device lineup is powered by Apple's M5 chip, which the company said has four times the peak compute performance compared with the previous M4.Johny Srouji, Apple's senior vice president of Hardware Technologies, said in a release that the \"M5 delivers a huge boost to AI workloads.\"Supercharged by the powerful M5 chip, the new 14-inch MacBook Pro delivers even more performance and takes the next big leap in AI for the Mac.Courtesy: Apple Inc.Read more CNBC tech news$1 trillion-worth of AI deals between OpenAI, Nvidia and others, in one chartWaymo plans robotaxi launch in London, marking its European debutASML looks to calm fears over 2026 growth as it warns of China sales declineMeta removes Facebook page allegedly used to target ICE agents after pressure from DOJWednesday's announcement comes as Wall Street analysts are closely watching Apple's new releases to see if the company is raising prices or eating costs related to President Donald Trump's announced and threatened tariffs, especially on semiconductors and China.Starting prices for the latest M5 models are the same as the previous versions.While iPads and MacBooks aren't as critical for Apple as iPhone sales, they are still massive businesses.Apple reported $6.58 billion in iPad sales in the June quarter, an 8% decrease on an annual basis that the company attributed to difficult comparisons to the year-ago quarter when new iPad Pros were released.Mac sales in the June quarter came in at $8.05 billion, a 15% increase on a year-over-year basis. Apple released a new version of what it calls its bestselling laptop, the MacBook Air, earlier this year.Apple has never broken out figures for the Vision Pro headset but they are included alongside Apple Watch and AirPods sales in the company's wearables, or other products, line item. Analysts believe the company's Vision Pro revenue is negligible.MacBook, iPads and Vision Pro put together are significantly less than Apple's iPhone revenue, which accounted for more than 47% of revenue in the company's June quarter at just under $45 billion.Wall Street analysts tend to focus on iPhone sales and growth over the company's secondary product lines.The new iPad Pro with M5 unlocks the most advanced iPad experience ever, packing an incredible amount of power and AI performance into the ultraportable design.Courtesy: Apple Inc.watch now",

Trump | Via Truth SocialAs artificial intelligence startups raise increasingly large sums of cash to fund their swelling infrastructure needs, they're turning to strategic partners like Nvidia and big venture firms such as Thrive Capital, Sequoia and Andreessen Horowitz.But one major financier has a name that's less familiar in the world of tech investing: MGX.Backed by Abu Dhabi's sovereign wealth fund and launched in March 2024, MGX has emerged as a key source of capital as hyperscalers Microsoft, Meta and Google, and startups like OpenAI race to build out the enormous computing power needed to meet expected AI demand.In September, MGX made another big splash, joining Oracle and Silver Lake in President Donald Trump's push to get TikTok under U.S. control.And on Wednesday, MGX was back in the news as part of another giant AI deal. MGX is joining investors including Nvidia, Microsoft, BlackRock and Elon Musk's xAI in purchasing Aligned Data Centers for $40 billion, the largest global data center deal to date. Aligned designs and operates facilities across North and South America.MGX was formed out of a joint venture between Group 42 (G42), a tech holding company based in the United Arab Emirates, and Mubadala Investment Company. Despite the geopolitical concerns that come with bringing vast amounts of Middle Eastern money into critical U.S. infrastructure, tech companies are welcoming MGX and its deep pockets into the fold.MGX's first major announcement in the U.S. landed in the fall of 2024, not quite two years after OpenAI's ChatGPT set the generative AI boom in motion.In its initial deal, MGX joined a consortium — now called AI Infrastructure Partnership (AIP) — formed by firms including BlackRock and Microsoft, to spend $100 billion on AI infrastructure, primarily in the U.S. Separately, Microsoft invested $1.5 billion in G42 to develop AI technologies in the Middle East, with G42 using Microsoft's Azure cloud service to power it all.The AIP consortium is also MGX's avenue into the latest deal for Aligned.watch nowMGX has since joined as a partner in Stargate, the $500 billion Trump-endorsed joint venture with OpenAI, Oracle and SoftBank to build AI infrastructure across the U.S. According to PitchBook, MGX has also invested in numerous companies over the past year, including Databricks, Anthropic and xAI. Its chairman is Tahnoon bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the national security advisor of the UAE and a brother of the country's president.Certain transactions suggest a level of coziness with Trump.Earlier this year, MGX reportedly provided $2 billion in funding to the crypto exchange Binance, using a cryptocurrency purchased from the Trump family's World Liberty Financial. Al Nahyan also visited President Trump in the White House this spring to announce a $1.4 trillion investment in the U.S. over the next decade.'Backdoor deal'And then came TikTok.On Sept. 25, Trump signed an executive order backing a proposed deal to keep the social media app, owned by China's ByteDance, running in the U.S.ByteDance faced an ultimatum under a federal law, passed with bipartisan support from members of Congress, requiring it to either divest the platform's American business or be shut down in the U.S.As part of Trump's executive order, MGX joined with Oracle and Silver Lake to take a combined 45% of TikTok USA, though details still haven't been officially announced.Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., blasted the arrangement.\"MGX – a shady Abu Dhabi firm – has already cut deals to get sensitive American technology while enriching the Trump family's crypto firm,\" Warren said in a statement last month. \"The American people deserve to know if the President has struck another backdoor deal for this billionaire takeover of TikTok.\"Representatives for MGX, OpenAI, Microsoft and BlackRock declined to comment for this story.The steel frame of data centers under construction during a tour of the OpenAI data center in Abilene, Texas, U.S., Sept. 23, 2025. Shelby Tauber | ReutersPatrick Moorhead, an analyst at Moor Insights & Strategy, said tech companies in the U.S. may need to partner with Middle East firms on AI in order to keep them from instead working with our chief international adversary.\"I believe in the Middle East… we either provide the goods or they will go to China,\" Moorhead said.Moorhead added that MGX is following the same playbook as Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund. They're trying to diversify away from oil, and AI is one area where they can put money to work.\"The amount of capital required is astronomical,\" Moorhead said. \"And they're willing to take the risks.\"Even though tech giants like Microsoft, Meta and Amazon have enough cash to fund their AI ambitions, additional resources are always welcome. That's also why many AI leaders are renting AI capacity from companies like CoreWeave instead of building it all themselves.\"I think they will find real acceptance among VCs because people are comfortable with sovereign wealth,\" said Bradley Tusk, a venture capitalist and co-founder of Tusk Capital Partners. \"This is a tough fundraising environment, so they're a potentially good source of capital.\"Tusk warned that MGX could get entangled in U.S. politics and the perception that it's too close to the Trump administration, which could be problematic if a Democrat is in the White House in the coming years.\"I think the biggest risk is that the only narrative right now is they are Trump's friends,\" Tusk said.WATCH: Oracle, OpenAI and SoftBank unveil $400 billion Stargate data center expansion.watch now",

Tom Brenner | The Washington Post | Getty ImagesGeneral Motors' announcement on Tuesday that its upcoming quarterly results will include a $1.6 billion charge from its electric vehicle investments is the latest in a string of troubling EV-related disclosures from big automakers.Ford CEO Jim Farley said late last month that he expects demand for fully electric vehicles to be slashed in half following the end of a federal tax credit program. His prediction came after Stellantis, the parent company of auto brands including Chrysler and Jeep, said it was scrapping its target of producing nothing but electric vehicles in Europe by 2030, and backed off ambitious targets for the U.S., notably for Chrysler.The industry, which was already facing hurdles imposed by the Trump administration, faces a hefty dose of uncertainty now that consumers can no longer take advantage of $7,500 tax credits for purchasing EVs. The incentives expired at the end of September as part of President Trump's signature spending bill.As automakers reset investor expectations, one name has been notably absent from the conversation: Tesla.Elon Musk's company is by far the largest seller of EVs in the U.S., though its market share has been sliding as competition has increased and its brand value has declined. Tesla's share of the all-electric market in the U.S. was estimated at 43.1% at the end of September, down from 49% at the end of last year, according to data provided to CNBC from Motor IntelligenceTesla is slated to report third-quarter results next week, and Wall Street will be eager to hear what kind of demand the company expects with the credits no longer available. Tesla recently unveiled stripped-down, lower-cost variants of its popular Model Y SUV and Model 3 sedans, offsetting some of the effective price increases that come with the loss of incentives.watch nowSteve Greenfield, general partner at investment firm Automotive Ventures, said the retreat of legacy automakers from the segment could be good news for Tesla as its market share may start to rebound. He said in an email that the company has \"very strong brand loyalty.\"\"Chances are, most Tesla buyers will continue to stay in the brand, as they buy their next new car,\" Greenfield said.However, significant challenges loom. Interest in battery electric vehicles \"is very likely to shrink dramatically\" in the fourth quarter, he said, due to the \"pull-ahead of demand,\" as consumers rushed to buy EVs before the credit expired. As the year ends, Tesla will likely face a \"double whammy,\" Greenfield said, from reduced BEV sales and lower margins on the cars they do sell.Tesla didn't respond to a request for comment.Investors have become more bullish. Following a 36% slump in the first quarter, the stock has rallied and is now up more than 7% for the year, aided by Musk's purchase of about $1 billion worth of Tesla stock in September.The brutal start to the year was linked to a consumer backlash in the U.S. and Europe in response to Musk's incendiary political rhetoric, his work for President Trump slashing the federal workforce, and his endorsements of far-right groups including Germany's AfD party.Sharing in the painIn the company's third-quarter earnings scheduled for next Wednesday, analysts are expecting to see revenue growth of 3.5% from a year earlier to $26.1 billion, according to LSEG. Analysts are projecting a revenue drop in the fourth quarter and a 3.5% slide for all of 2025, which would mark the first full-year decline on record.Earlier this month, Tesla reported a 7% year-over-year increase in quarterly vehicle deliveries for the third quarter. That marked a turnaround after two consecutive quarterly declines to start the year.\"It's not just a retreat of everybody else, and Tesla gets to run away with the market,\" said Mark Wakefield, global automotive market lead at Alix Partners, in an interview.Consumer demand for fully electric vehicles had \"already kind of flatlined a bit\" even before the Republican spending bill, Wakefield added. Car buyers have been looking for a \"breakthrough moment\" where EVs would become cost competitive with hybrid or gas-powered models.Wakefield added that \"this market needs a sense of newness,\" and that the new, lower-priced Model Y and Model 3 options are not exactly \"earth shattering.\"The Trump administration isn't making life easy.Robbie Orvis, a senior director at Energy Innovation, a nonpartisan climate policy think tank, told CNBC the automakers' writedowns were expected and stem entirely from policy changes beyond just the tax credits.The Trump White House has also \"revoked California's waiver to set its own vehicle standards, revoked billions in funding for EV chargers and for auto plants to retool to build EVs, and is in the process of undoing vehicle tailpipe standards that would encourage the adoption of EVs,\" Orvis said.Those policies, along with tariffs, have already caused billions of dollars in losses for U.S. automakers, which means they aren't in a position to invest in new market segments, Orvis said.Tesla is experiencing its share of that pain, and it's showing up most acutely in international markets.\"Chinese automakers are rapidly displacing U.S. automakers in foreign markets as they are able to offer cheaper, higher-quality new cars, particularly EVs, in markets where there is large and growing demand for these cars,\" Orvis said.The Tesla Bot humanoid robot of Tesla ''Optimus'' is displayed at the 2023 World Artificial Intelligence Conference in Shanghai, China, July 6, 2023.Costfoto | Nurphoto | Getty ImagesMusk, meanwhile, continues to try and focus investor attention elsewhere.He insists the future of the company hinges on robotaxis and humanoid robotics, two markets that Tesla has yet to meaningfully crack. Tesla is testing its Robotaxi-branded service in limited capacity in some cities, but is way behind Alphabet's Waymo, which is rapidly expanding commercial operations.Musk said in March that Tesla aimed to make 5,000 of its Optimus robots this year, but key departures from the group have thrown that plan into question.In September, Musk wrote on X that \"~80% of Tesla's value will be Optimus.\" Last year, he predicted that Optimus robots would someday turn Tesla into a $25 trillion company, which was equal to more than half of the entire value of the S&P 500 at the time of his comment.It's a story that's compelling enough for some longtime Tesla bulls and Musk fanboys. But at the moment, the company still relies on sales of EVs to drive its business. And in the U.S., while Tesla's market share may be poised to rise, the overall pie — at least in the near term — appears to be shrinking.— CNBC's Mike Wayland contributed to this reportWATCH: Former Ford CEO says EV market didn't develop way automakers thoughtwatch now",

    "body": "watch nowFor months, experts have warned that student loan borrowers who are behind on their payments may trigger a \"default cliff.\" Recent reports show that cliff is now looming.The resumption of federal student loan delinquency reporting on consumers' credit earlier this year caused a spike in the rate of severe delinquencies, which now near a record high, according to September's Credit Insights report from credit score developer FICO. Roughly 5.3 million borrowers are in default and another 4.3 million borrowers are in \"late-stage delinquency,\" or between 181 and 270 days late on their payments, according to a separate analysis last month by the Congressional Research Service based on data from the Education Department. Payments 270 days past due are considered in default.With so many borrowers already seriously delinquent, \"if these borrowers do not start paying soon, defaults will meaningfully rise,\" Moody's Analytics economist Justin Begley told CNBC.  According to Begley's projections, \"we should expect many borrowers to be pushed into default in coming months.\" Read more CNBC personal finance coverageMillions of student loan borrowers at risk of default as late payments climbWhat laid off federal workers need to know about their student loansDespite government shutdown, Oct. 15 is still the tax extension deadlineBoomers still love their department stores.

Those who have not made payments since then could have entered default as of late June. 'Bubble' of borrowers headed toward defaultHigher education expert Mark Kantrowitz said there is currently a \"bubble\" of borrowers moving through each stage of delinquency.Many of the borrowers in this bubble were in default before the pandemic and took advantage of the government relief measures to return their loans to \"current\" status by late 2024, he said. \"I expect that these borrowers will default when they become 270 days delinquent, then the delinquency and default rates will return to previous norms.\"Student loan borrowers often fall behind on payments because they can't afford the monthly expense. However, repayment options that cap monthly payments based on income are dwindling, due to recent court actions and President Donald Trump's \"big beautiful bill.\"The Income-Based Repayment plan, or IBR, is now considered the best alternative for borrowers looking for an affordable repayment option, experts say.Risk of 'financial ruin'In a new letter to the U.S. Department of Education, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and other lawmakers also warned of a worsening wave of defaults.Significant staffing cuts at the Education Department and the passage of Trump's \"big beautiful bill\" have reduced access to debt relief and made defaults more likely, Warren wrote in the letter sent late Tuesday to U.S. Secretary of Education Linda McMahon and shared exclusively with CNBC.In the letter, also signed by Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., Sen. Angela Alsobrooks, D-Md., Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y. and Rep. Ayanna Pressley, D-Mass., the lawmakers said the \"devastating increase in past due payments threatens not only individual borrowers but the broader economy by suppressing consumer spending and locking families out of housing and other financial opportunities.\"The Education Department should \"work with Congress to avert this economic disaster,\" the lawmakers wrote. The Education Department should clear the backlog of income-driven repayment applications and create an interest-free temporary default prevention forbearance program for borrowers, they wrote.In an email to CNBC, Warren also said \"if the administration fails to act, millions of Americans will be pushed to financial ruin.\"As of the end of August, the Education Department had a backlog of nearly 1.1 million applications from borrowers trying to get into an income-driven repayment, or IDR, plan, according to court records from mid-September.The Education Department did not respond to an emailed request for comment. \"Due to the lapse in appropriations, we are currently in furlough status. We will respond to emails once government functions resume,\" an auto-response said.Subscribe to CNBC on YouTube.",

    "body": "The Good Brigade | Digitalvision | Getty ImagesIn recent weeks, some federal student loan borrowers have received welcome news: The U.S. Department of Education will soon cancel their remaining debt.\"You are now eligible to have some or all of your federal student loan(s) discharged because you have reached the necessary number of payments under your Income-Based Repayment (IBR) Plan,\" reads an email sent to one borrower.The notices stand out, consumer advocates say, because student loan forgiveness has become rare under the Trump administration.Since President Donald Trump took office, the U.S. Department of Education has stopped the relief under several programs in response to court actions and recent legislation. Meanwhile, tens of thousands of borrowers find themselves stuck in a backlog of buyback applications for Public Service Loan Forgiveness, an initiative that guarantees debt erasure for public servants after a decade.The Education Department did not respond to a request for comment.Here what to know about who qualifies for the latest round of loan cancellation.Borrowers must be enrolled in IBR planWhile many student loan borrowers switch repayment plans over the life of their loan, the only plan that currently qualifies for debt cancellation after a certain period is the Income-Based Repayment plan, or IBR.That's due to recent court actions and Trump's \"big beautiful bill,\" which phases out several existing income-driven repayment plans, or IDRs.Congress created the first IDR plans in the 1990s to make student loan borrowers' bills more affordable. Historically, the plans cap people's monthly payments at a share of their discretionary income and cancel any remaining debt after a certain period, typically 20 years or 25 years.Borrowers who are receiving these latest notices have likely transferred from an IDR plan that no longer concludes in debt forgiveness, such as the Income-Contingent Repayment plan, or ICR, to IBR.Borrowers may need up to 300 qualifying paymentsTo qualify for IBR forgiveness, a borrower needs to be in repayment for 20 years or 25 years, depending on the age of their loans.IBR, which has been available since 2009, offers debt cancellation after 240 payments to those who borrowed after July 1, 2014. For loans taken out before that date, borrowers were required to make 300 payments before the Education Department would scrub their balance.If you've been in repayment long enough to qualify for the relief but still haven't received a loan forgiveness email, you should continue making payments, said higher education expert Mark Kantrowitz. You don't want to be flagged as late, and any overpayments should be refunded to you, he said.Borrowers who have switched repayment plans over the years may find some payments on other plans qualify toward IBR forgiveness. As long as your payments were made on an IDR plan, experts say, that time should count toward your forgiveness timeline once you're enrolled in IBR.Government shutdown could mean delays in reliefAccording to the Education Department forgiveness emails, the qualifying borrowers' IBR loan discharges will be processed \"over the next several months,\" and they have until Oct. 21 to opt out of the relief.The ongoing government shutdown could delay the loan cancellation, said Carolina Rodriguez, director of the Education Debt Consumer Assistance Program.\"That said, many borrowers may feel somewhat desensitized to these delays, given the existing backlog, which has been exacerbated by prior staffing reductions within the Department of Education,\" Rodriguez said.Have you received an email from the Education Department stating that you qualify for IBR forgiveness?

    "body": "Warren Buffett and Greg Abel walkthrough the Berkshire Hathaway Annual Shareholders Meeting in Omaha, Nebraska on May 3, 2025.David A. Grogen | CNBCWarren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway reported a sharp rebound in operating profit on Saturday, while its cash pile swelled to a new high with no buybacks.Berkshire's operating profit generated from the conglomerate's wholly owned businesses including insurance and railroads jumped 34% year over year to $13.485 billion in the third quarter. The gains were driven by a more than 200% surge in insurance underwriting income, which rose to $2.37 billion.Buffett once again refrained from repurchasing shares despite a significant pullback in the stock. The company said there were no share buybacks during the first nine months of 2025. Class A and B shares of the conglomerate are up 5% each in 2025, while the S&P 500 is up 16.3%.Without any buybacks, Berkshire's cash hoard swelled to a record $381.6 billion, surpassing the previous high of $347.7 billion set in the first quarter of this year.Berkshire also didn't find other stocks attractive, net selling equities in the third quarter for a taxable gain of $10.4 billion.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconBerkshire Hathaway class A shares year to dateThe 95-year-old Buffett in May announced he's stepping down as CEO at the year-end after six legendary decades. Greg Abel, Berkshire's vice chairman of non-insurance operations, is set to take over as chief executive, while Buffett will remain chairman of the board. Abel will also start writing annual letters in 2026.The Omaha-based conglomerate's shares have tumbled double digits from all-time highs following the announcement. The sell-off partially reflects the so-called Buffett premium, or the extra price investors are willing to pay because of the billionaire's unmatched record and exceptional capital allocation skills.Last month, Berkshire announced a deal to buy Occidental Petroleum's petrochemical unit, OxyChem, for $9.7 billion in cash. The deal marks Berkshire's largest since 2022, when it paid $11.6 billion for insurer Alleghany.Overall earnings, which include gains from Berkshire's investments in other publicly traded companies, rose 17% to $30.8 billion year on year.

Jim Watson | Afp | Getty ImagesDe-escalation in tensions between China and the U.S. after their leaders met in South Korea last Thursday stands in stark contrast to the chill in Washington-New Delhi relations, with India now subject to higher U.S. tariffs than Beijing.Experts said that the strategic relationship between India and U.S. built over two decades has substantially eroded.Atman Trivedi a partner and lead of the South Asia Practice at DGA-Albright Stonebridge Group said trust between the two countries \"could take years rebuild.\"Steep tariffs, $100,000 fee for H1B visas, and U.S. President Donald Trump's repeated claims of having brokered a ceasefire between India and Pakistan are among issues that have led to deterioration of ties between New Delhi and Washington in recent months, according to experts.\"President Trump evidently does not value India as a partner in balancing China as much as the previous presidents,\" said Raymond Vickery Jr., senior associate and chair on India and emerging Asia Economics at Center for Strategic and International Studies.The U.S. foreign policy from President Bill Clinton until recently, including Trump's first term as the president, had consistently valued \"democratic India over autocratic China,\" he said, adding that the approach toward India has now shifted from one of strategic altruism to \"transactionalism.\"Meanwhile, ties between the U.S. and China appear to be on the mend.In a post on Truth Social on Saturday, Trump said \"My G2 meeting President Xi of China was a great one for both of our countries\" adding that it would lead to \"everlasting peace and success.\"  Shortly after, Pete Hegseth, U.S. secretary of defense, said on X that China and the U.S. had agreed to set up \"miliary-to-military channels to deconflict and deescalate\" any problems.Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping reached a trade truce in a high-stakes meeting in South Korea on Thursday which saw Washington cutting tariffs on Beijing related to fentanyl to 10% from 20%, reducing the overall rate on Chinese goods to around 47%.China now pays a lower tariff than India.In August the U.S. imposed 50% tariffs on India including secondary duties of 25% for its purchase of Russian oil. India has called the move \"unfair, unjustified and unreasonable,\" while has called U.S. trade ties with India \"a totally one-sided disaster!\"U.S. President Donald Trump meets with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington, DC, on Feb. 13, 2025.Jim Watson | Afp | Getty Images\"At the leader-level, the chemistry is missing for now, and the impact of this disconnect on the U.S.-India relationship probably cannot be overstated,\" Trivedi added.During his Asia trip last week, while addressing corporate leaders at Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in South Korea, Trump said he threatened India and Pakistan with 250% tariffs unless they stopped hostilities.An attack by militants in the Indian-controlled region of Kashmir in April killed 26 civilians. India accused Pakistan and launched a military strike, resulting in a four-day conflict that threatened to explode into a broader war fueled by decades of tensions between the two countries.\"The strategic relationship between India and the U.S. has been under strain this year not just because of tariffs, but also because of Washington's posture in the conflict with Pakistan and the apparent warming of [U.S.] ties with Pakistan's military,\" said Alexandra Hermann, head of Southeast Asia Research at Oxford Economics.Trump's claims are being picked up by Modi's political opponents including the leader of opposition Rahul Gandhi. Modi is \"scared\" of U.S. President Donald Trump, Gandhi reportedly said on Sunday in a political rally in Bihar.Hermann added that now the challenge for India would be to find its position between two economic superpowers.\"While New Delhi stands to benefit from greater access to U.S. demand, its dependence on China is unlikely to diminish in the near term given the still-extreme uncertainty around trade policy and the costs of relocating supply chains,\" she said.Keeping aside strained trade ties, U.S. and India on Friday signed a 10-year \"Framework for the US-India Major Defence Partnership.\"Hegseth said on X that the two countries were improving \"coordination, info sharing, and tech cooperation,\" while his Indian counter Rajnath Singh said the partnership between U.S. and India was \"critical for ensuring a free, open and rules-based Indo-Pacific region.\"Experts warn if U.S. sticks with its transactional approach toward India, it will drive the two further apart, compromising strategic interests of both.\"The Trump policy will push India further toward Russia, the Global South, and even China. This will not be in the interests of either India or the US,\" said Vickery Jr. from CSIS.",

(Photo by VCG/VCG via Getty Images)Vcg | Visual China Group | Getty ImagesK-pop prospects have brightened after Seoul and Beijing signed a content exchange deal, potentially paving the way for South Korean entertainment to re-enter the Chinese market.South Korea's national broadcaster KBS on Saturday entered into a media exchange and cooperation business agreement with Chinese state media company China Media Group. CMG includes state media enterprises such as China Central Television, and is directly controlled by the Chinese Communist Party.Shares of SM Entertainment rose as much as 8.11%, while JYP Entertainment gained over 9.39%. YG Entertainment and Hybe saw day-high gains of about 4% and 3%, respectively. The stocks have since pared gains.KBS said this agreement would \"promote content exchanges across the board, not only in news and sports, but also across culture, including the Chinese launch of the 'Music Bank World Tour.'\" Music Bank is KBS' flagship program that features K-pop artists when they release new music.KBS President Park Jang-beom said \"I think it's meaningful that we've created a breakthrough that will allow the entire Korean content industry to once again make a full-fledged foray into the Chinese market.\"This comes as South Korean President Lee Jae Myung and Chinese President Xi Jinping met during the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation, or APEC, summit, with Lee writing on Facebook that the summit was \"very significant in the fact that it has fully restored the Korea-China relations.\"The return of K-pop to China could mark a turning point in the industry, after China imposed a \"soft ban\" on K-pop content in 2016 after South Korea deployed U.S.' Terminal High Altitude Area Defense anti-ballistic missile system, also known as THAAD, on its soil.Share price driversOh Jiwoo, research analyst at the Korea branch of CGS International Securities Hong Kong, explained why SM and JYP saw larger gains on Monday.For JYP, the share price gain was driven by founder Park Jin-young's meeting with the Chinese president at the state dinner of the China-South Korea summit.Park, who is also co-chair of South Korea's Presidential Committee on Popular Culture Exchange, posted a photo on his Instagram account of himself, South Korea's Lee and China's Xi engaging in conversation. South Korean lawmaker Kim Yong Bae posted on Facebook that during the conversation, a proposal was made to host a large scale concert in Beijing, and Xi responded by summoning Foreign Minister Wang Yi and giving instructions. \"I anticipate that this will be a moment that goes beyond the lifting of the ban on Korean culture and opens the door to full-scale advancement into Korea,\" Kim said, according to a Google translation.For SM, Oh pointed out that the company had historically shown the highest sensitivity to China related news, and also because SM's second largest shareholder is Chinese tech giant Tencent.In April, SM subsidiary DearU had also partnered with Tencent Music Entertainment to launch its Bubble messaging service in China.watch nowKBS plans to solidify its cooperation with CMG at the APEC Summit to be held in Shenzhen, China next year, the network said.Local media outlets have also reported that the partnership will help reviving the \"Korea-China Song Festival,\" an event that was held from 1999 to 2016, and saw Peng Liyuan, the wife of China's President Xi Jinping performing at the festival in 2006, according to KBS.\"In my view, I think it's still a positive sign that culture cooperation is starting to pick up again. And when it comes to [the] KBS and CMG agreement, I think it's also a very meaningful step toward normalizing K Pop activities in China,\" Oh said.While there have been small scale K-pop appearances by groups, such as fan meetings and individual member appearances, concerts or large-scale activities have not been held on mainland China, with groups making their tour stops in Macau or Hong Kong.In what would have been the first time an all-Korean group held a concert in mainland China since 2016, boy band EPEX was to perform in Fuzhou, China, in May, but the show was \"postponed due to local circumstances,\" according to South Korean media.China's K-pop export shareMainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan combined were among K-pop's largest markets, despite the \"soft ban,\" being the second largest export market for music exports from South Korea in terms of export share in 2023, according to a Korea Creative Content Agency report published in July. They accounted for 26.1% of music exports from South Korea in 2023, amounting to $319.58 million.Japan, South Korea's largest export market for music, had a 35.1% export share, with $429.08 million worth of music exports in 2023.According to the 2025 Overseas Hallyu Survey published by South Korea's Korea Foundation for International Cultural Exchange, China's favorability rating toward South Korea stood at 73.5%, higher than the survey's overall average.Hallyu, or the Korean Wave, refers to the spread of South Korean content around the world. The survey also noted that interest in Hallyu content within China has not waned despite the restrictions on the direct distribution of Korean content.\"Overall, Chinese consumers' interest in and consumption of Korean cultural content continues to grow, and there is significant potential for Korean content to exert even greater economic and cultural influence in the future,\" it added. The survey also noted that Chinese government's recent announcement of policies aimed at attracting foreign investment and easing regulations are fueling expectations for the easing of the Hallyu ban.In a report earlier this year, Morgan Stanley had noted that the rally in K-pop stocks was mainly due to investor expectations that China will open its market to K-pop performers.— CNBC's Blair Baek contributed to this report.",

But Musk is again promising that a new one is on the way.In a discussion with podcaster Joe Rogan that was published on Friday, Musk was asked about the long-delayed vehicle. He provided a sense of timing but declined to share updated technical or design details.\"I can't do the unveil before the unveil,\" Musk said. As he's said before, Musk claimed the new Roadster \"has a shot at being the most memorable product unveil ever.\"Tesla is aiming to show off the updated Roadster to fans and investors \"hopefully before the end of the year,\" Musk said.Musk's comments come a day after former close friend Sam Altman, OpenAI's CEO, posted on X that he tried to cancel his Roadster reservation from 2018 and get his deposit refunded. He shared a screenshot showing that his email to the company had bounced back.\"I really was excited for the car!\" Altman wrote. \"And I understand delays. But 7.5 years has felt like a long time to wait.\"Musk, who helped start OpenAI in 2015, is in a heated legal dispute with Altman and now runs competing artificial intelligence startup xAI.Patrick George, editor-in-chief at InsideEVs and a long-time industry observer, told CNBC on Friday that the Roadster \"has been MIA for years.\"\"The only thing I can think of that would make Musk start talking about this again is that Sam Altman at OpenAI, who is sort of his arch-rival, just said recently that he was trying to cancel his Roadster reservation which he has held since 2018,\" George said.Earlier this year, the popular gadget and autos reviewer Marques Brownlee discussed the arduous process of cancelling his own Roadster reservation in an interview with Waveform Podcast.The Roadster is a high end, low-volume model, something meant to challenge vehicles like BYD's YangWang U9 Xtreme, which was recently crowned the world's fastest production car.Musk faces a major Tesla shareholder vote next week, as he and the board are asking investors to approve a massive pay package.The pay plan would net Musk nearly $1 trillion in Tesla stock and would grow his stake to around 25%, depending on the company hitting various market valuations and other growth milestones.WATCH: CNBC's interview with Tesla Chair Robyn Denholmwatch now",

    "body": "Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella speaks during an event commemorating the 50th anniversary of the company at Microsoft headquarters in Redmond, Washington, on April 4, 2025. Microsoft Corp., determined to hold its ground in artificial intelligence, will soon let consumers tailor the Copilot digital assistant to their own needs.David Ryder | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesMicrosoft will expand its employee base once again, CEO Satya Nadella told investor Brad Gerstner on a podcast that aired on Friday.The software maker's workforce didn't budge in the 2025 fiscal year, which ended in June. It stood at 228,000, with multiple rounds of layoffs lowering the total number by at least 6,000. In July, Microsoft let go of another 9,000 workers.\"I will say we will grow our headcount, but the way I look at it is, that headcount we grow will grow with a lot more leverage than the headcount we had pre-AI,\" Nadella said on the BG2 podcast. OpenAI, which has a broad partnership with Microsoft, introduced its ChatGPT assistant in 2022. Microsoft's headcount grew by 22% in the 2022 fiscal year.Employees will figure out how to do their jobs differently, Nadella said, adding that the company wants to ensure they can access artificial intelligence features in Microsoft 365 productivity software and the GitHub Copilot AI coding assistant. Those services draw on AI models from Anthropic and OpenAI.\"It's the unlearning and learning process that I think will take the next year or so, then the headcount growth will come with max leverage,\" he said.A similar adjustment played out at corporations decades ago, Nadella said. To prepare forecasts, inter-office memos would circulate across multiple sites by fax, and then came email and Excel spreadsheets, he said.\"Right now, any planning, any execution, starts with AI. You research with AI, you think with AI, you share with your colleagues and what have you,\" Nadella said.This week, Amazon, which is racing against Microsoft to rent out cloud infrastructure for running AI models, cut 14,000 corporate employees.Amazon's senior vice president of people experience and technology, Beth Galetti, told workers in a memo that \"this generation of AI is the most transformative technology we've seen since the Internet, and it's enabling companies to innovate much faster than ever before (in existing market segments and altogether new ones).\"On the podcast, Nadella talked about a Microsoft executive who deals with networking fiber. As the company ramped up data center operations to meet rising cloud demand, the executive realized she wouldn't be able to hire all the people she thought she needed, and so she built AI agents to handle maintenance, Nadella said.\"That is an example of you, to your point, a team with AI tools being able to get more productivity,\" Nadella told Gerstner, who is founder and CEO of technology investment firm Altimeter Capital.On Wednesday, Microsoft reported 12% year-over-year revenue growth and showed the widest operating margin since 2002.WATCH: Microsoft earnings beat estimates, Azure revenue jumps 40%watch now",

    "body": "A wheel loader takes ore to a crusher at the MP Materials rare earth mine in Mountain Pass, California, U.S. January 30, 2020.Steve Marcus | ReutersThe emergence of critical minerals as a new arena of geopolitical competition has coincided with a dizzying rally in U.S.-listed rare earths mining stocks.Despite paring gains in recent weeks, shares of Critical Metals have advanced 241% over the last three months, while NioCorp Developments, Energy Fuels and Idaho Strategic Resources have all surged well above 100% over the same period.The eye-watering gains are even more remarkable year-to-date. Energy Fuels' stock price has quadrupled through the first 10 months of the year, while NioCorp Developments' shares have nearly quintupled.Rare earths have come to the fore as a key bargaining chip in the ongoing geopolitical rivalry between the U.S. and China, the world's two largest economies.Tony Sage, CEO of Critical Metals, which has one of the world's largest rare earths deposits in southern Greenland, described the rally of U.S.-listed rare earths miners as evidence of a major market boom.\"I talk of it like this, I mean, there have been four big booms. You had the gold boom in the 19th century, the oil boom in the 20th century, in the early 21st century you had the tech boom — and now you've got the rare earths boom,\" Sage told CNBC by telephone.\"But the rare earths boom is the future. It will power all of the above.\"We are going from a philosophy of 'fill the gap' through imports to 'mine the gap' domestically or regionally.Audun MartinsenHead of supply chain research at Rystad EnergyRare earths refer to 17 elements on the periodic table that have an atomic structure that gives them special magnetic properties. These materials are vital components to a vast array of modern technologies, from everyday electronics, such as smartphones, to electric vehicles and military equipment.China, which has a near-monopoly on rare earths, recently threatened to expand its export controls on the elements to further leverage its dominance of the supply chain. However, following an in-person meeting in South Korea on Thursday between U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping, Beijing agreed to delay the Oct. 9 export controls by one year.U.S.-listed rare earths stocks rallied on the news, although analysts remain skeptical about whether the apparent trade truce can offer long-term relief.U.S. President Donald Trump shakes hands with Chinese President Xi Jinping as they hold a bilateral meeting at Gimhae International Airport, on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit, in Busan, South Korea, October 30, 2025. Evelyn Hockstein | Reuters\"As in all booms, there were a lot of oil companies that couldn't find oil and there were a lot of gold companies that couldn't find gold. And I'm sure there are going to be a lot of rare earths companies that won't make it either — because when there's a boom, there's hype. And when there's hype, there's overexuberance in investing,\" Critical Metals' Sage said.\"It's not a straight rise up. It's a jagged line, but the trend is in the right direction if you've got the right project in the right place, and you've got the right partners,\" he added.'A much bigger and longer supercycle'Kevin Das, senior technical consultant at New Frontier Minerals, an Australian-based rare earths explorer, agreed with Sage's description of a rare earths market boom, while acknowledging the likelihood of stock price pullbacks.\"People are saying we're in an uptrend on what is a bigger supercycle and some of the evidence behind that is there has been low commodity prices for some time, there's been underinvestment. And now, with the advent of AI ... we're going to see a much bigger and longer supercycle,\" Das told CNBC by telephone.Das drew parallels between the Biden administration's support of clean energy projects, which coincided with a rally in lithium-related stocks, and the Trump administration's backing of rare earths.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconShares of Critical Metals over the last three months.\"In the last nine to 10 months that Trump has been in power, he's talked about annexing Greenland, he's talked about doing a deal with Ukraine for rare earths and then the real clincher was this equity deal with MP Materials,\" Das said.\"So, I think the runway over the next two to three years is going to be very fruitful,\" he added.Not everyone is as bullish on the outlook for rare earths-related stocks, however.Audun Martinsen, head of supply chain research at Rystad Energy, said the recent surge in equity prices reflected a mix of geopolitical tension, strategic policy support and speculative momentum.\"Rare earths have clearly moved to the center of global industrial strategy, vital for defense, EVs and clean energy, but this looks more like the early stages of a structural shift than a mature 'fourth boom,'\" Martinsen told CNBC by email.Neodymium is displayed at the Inner Mongolia Baotou Steel Rare-Earth Hi-Tech Co. factory in Baotou, Inner Mongolia, China, on Wednesday, May 5, 2010.Bloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty Images\"We are going from a philosophy of 'fill the gap' through imports to 'mine the gap' domestically or regionally,\" he continued. \"It will be a lengthy, expensive and rocky path forward as adequate, cost-effective resources and element diversity are complex to get full control over.\"Clean energy transitionGernot Wagner, a climate economist at Columbia University, said there were two clear factors at work as global competition intensifies to secure the supply of critical minerals — one structural and the other political.\"The structural: Despite whatever political attempts there may be to stop or derail things, the clean-energy transition is happening — and it is accelerating — and yes, it depends on a number of critical minerals, whose prices are bound to jump,\" Wagner told CNBC by email.Read moreChina, for instance, is the low-cost supplier of many of these minerals, Wagner said, noting that the Asian giant's mineral dominance is by no means an accident.\"Beijing has invested heavily in green industrial policy for years, focusing on the full, integrated supply chain. That's where politics enters,\" Wagner said.\"Some attempts to onshore supply chains are eminently justified for national security and other reasons, and those attempts will increase prices and stocks of U.S. mining companies. Some of what we see, of course, is merely the current politics or erratic trade wars and the like,\" he added.",

    "body": "When your kid is in the middle of a tantrum, logic and lectures don't work.I've studied over 200 kids and worked with hundreds of families, and one thing is clear: Tantrums aren't about defiance. Research shows that during emotional overwhelm, a child's prefrontal cortex (the part of the brain responsible for reasoning and language) essentially goes offline. It's why \"use your words\" falls flat when they're screaming.What they need in that moment is connection. These seven magic phrases work with your child's nervous system by calming the storm, restoring safety, and teaching emotional regulation — the real skill behind resilience.1. Say nothingWhen your child is mid-meltdown, your instinct is to make it stop... fast. You want the screaming to end, the tears to dry, the chaos to pass. So you start talking: \"Calm down,\" \"Use your words,\" \"Tell me what's wrong.\"But often, the fastest way to end a tantrum is silence. When your child's body is in full distress, every word you add is like oxygen to a fire. Their \"thinking brain\" has shut down. Words simply can't land. But your nervous system can reach them instantly.Sit close. Stay relaxed. Saying nothing essentially communicates an important phrase: \"You're safe, and I can handle this.\" Once their breathing slows and the peak has passed, that's when your spoken words can start to land.2. 'I'm right here.'This short phrase is a lifeline. You're not walking away, threatening consequences, or trying to reason. You're anchoring them back into connection.A tantrum often triggers a primal fear: Am I still loved when I'm out of control? Your calm presence answers that question instantly. Connection regulates the stress response faster than correction ever can. Emotional safety quiets the body's alarm system.3. 'This feeling is really big, huh?'Instead of minimizing their emotions or rushing them through it, this phrase acknowledges the size of the feeling. It helps kids see what's happening inside rather than being consumed by it.Validation activates the brain's calming pathways. When children feel seen, their bodies release tension. And that's the first step toward emotional awareness.4. 'It's okay to feel angry. It's not okay to hit.'Parents often swing between being too permissive or too harsh. This phrase strikes the balance. You're separating the feeling from the behavior, and validating the emotion while holding the boundary.Consistent limits paired with emotional acceptance build impulse control — the foundation of self-discipline.5. 'Let's take a break together.'Sometimes, a \"time-in\" works better than a \"time-out.\" This phrase teaches your child to regulate with you. Invite them to sit, breathe, or just be still until the storm passes. Proximity restores safety faster than isolation ever could.When children are dysregulated, they need your nervous system to co-regulate theirs. Your calm is contagious.6. 'I can see how much you wanted that.'This phrase helps acknowledge the emotion underneath your child's behavior: disappointment, frustration, or longing. When kids feel seen, they don't need to keep screaming to prove their feelings are real.Validation lowers the brain's threat response. Once a child feels understood, their nervous system begins to settle — and the tantrum ends naturally, without punishment or bribes.7. 'You can be mad, and I'll still love you.'Unconditional safety is what every child needs most. Tantrums often test an unspoken question: \"Will you still love me when I'm not lovable?\"This phrase answers it clearly and teaches emotional security for life. It also rewires the shame response. Children learn that love isn't withdrawn for imperfection, and that's the beginning of self-worth.Reem Raouda is a leading voice in conscious parenting and the creator of FOUNDATIONS, a step-by-step guide that helps parents heal and become emotionally safe. She is widely recognized for her expertise in children's emotional safety and for redefining what it means to raise emotionally healthy kids.

    "body": "Mustafa Suleyman, CEO of Microsoft AI, speaks at an event commemorating the 50th anniversary of the company at Microsoft headquarters in Redmond, Washington, on April 4, 2025.David Ryder | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesMicrosoft AI chief Mustafa Suleyman says only biological beings are capable of consciousness, and that developers and researchers should stop pursuing projects that suggest otherwise.\"I don't think that is work that people should be doing,\" Suleyman told CNBC in an interview this week at the AfroTech Conference in Houston, where he was among the keynote speakers. \"If you ask the wrong question, you end up with the wrong answer. I think it's totally the wrong question.\"Suleyman, Microsoft's top executive working on artificial intelligence, has been one of the leading voices in the rapidly emerging field to speak out against the prospect of seemingly conscious AI, or AI services that can convince humans they're capable of suffering.In 2023, he co-authored the book \"The Coming Wave,\" which delves into the risks of AI and other emerging technologies. And in August, Suleyman penned an essay titled, \"We must build AI for people; not to be a person.\"It's a controversial topic, as the AI companion market is swiftly growing, with products from companies including Meta and Elon Musk's xAI. And it's a complicated issue as the generative AI market, led by Sam Altman and OpenAI, pushes towards artificial general intelligence (AGI), or AI that can perform intellectual tasks on par with the capabilities of humans.Read more CNBC reporting on AIThis Meta alum has spent 10 months leading OpenAI's nationwide hunt for its Stargate data centersAI Sam Altman and the Sora copyright gamble: 'I hope Nintendo doesn't sue us'Anthropic launches Claude Sonnet 4.5, its latest AI model that's 'more of a colleague'Sam Altman on worries about OpenAI’s $850 billion in planned buildouts: ‘I totally get that’Altman told CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" in August that AGI is \"not a super useful term\" and that what's really happening is models are advancing quickly and that we'll rely on them \"for more and more things.\"For Suleyman, it's particularly important to draw a clear contrast between AI getting smarter and more capable versus its ability to ever have human emotions.\"Our physical experience of pain is something that makes us very sad and feel terrible, but the AI doesn't feel sad when it experiences 'pain,'\" Suleyman said. \"It's a very, very important distinction. It's really just creating the perception, the seeming narrative of experience and of itself and of consciousness, but that is not what it's actually experiencing. Technically you know that because we can see what the model is doing.\"Within the AI field, there's a theory called biological naturalism, proposed by philosopher John Searle, that says consciousness depends on processes of a living brain. \"The reason we give people rights today is because we don't want to harm them, because they suffer. They have a pain network, and they have preferences which involve avoiding pain,\" Suleyman said. \"These models don't have that. It's just a simulation.\"watch nowSuleyman and others have said that the science of detecting consciousness is still in its infancy. He stopped short of saying that others should be prevented from researching the matter, acknowledging that \"different organizations have different missions.\"But Suleyman emphasized how strongly he opposes the idea. \"They're not conscious,\" he said. \"So it would be absurd to pursue research that investigates that question, because they're not and they can't be.\"'Places that we won't go'Suleyman is on a speaking tour, in part to inform the public of the risks of pursuing AI consciousness.Prior to the AfroTech Conference, he spoke last week at the Paley International Council Summit in Silicon Valley. There, Suleyman said that Microsoft will not build chatbots for erotica, a stance that's in conflict with others in the tech industry. Altman announced in October that ChatGPT will allow adult users to engage in erotic conversations, while xAI offers a risque anime companion.\"You can basically buy those services from other companies, so we're making decisions about what places that we won't go,\" Suleyman reiterated at AfroTech. Suleyman joined Microsoft in 2024 after the company paid his startup, Inflection AI, $650 million in a licensing and acquihire deal. He previously co-founded DeepMind and sold it to Google for $400 million over a decade ago.During his Q&A session at AfroTech, Suleyman said he decided to join Microsoft last year in part because of the company's history, stability and vast technological reach. He was also pursued by CEO Satya Nadella.\"The other thing to say is that Microsoft needed to be self-sufficient in AI,\" he said onstage. \"Satya, our CEO, set about on this mission about 18 months ago, to make sure that in house we have the capacity to train our own models end to end with all of our own data, pre training, post training, reasoning, deployment in products. And that was part of bringing on my team.\"Since 2019, Microsoft has been a major investor and cloud partner to OpenAI, and the companies have used their respective strengths to build big AI businesses. But the relationship has shown signs of tension of late, with OpenAI partnering with Microsoft rivals like Google and Oracle, and Microsoft focusing more on its own AI services.Suleyman's concerns about consciousness have gained resonance. In October, California Gov. Gavin Newsom signed SB 243, which requires that chatbots disclose they are AI and tell minors every three hours to \"take a break.\"Last week, Microsoft announced new features for its Copilot AI service, including an AI companion called Mico and the ability to engage with Copilot in group chats with others. Suleyman said Microsoft is building services that are aware that they're AI. \"Quite simply, we're creating AIs that are always working in service of the human,\" he said. There's plenty of room for personality, he added.\"The knowledge is there, and the models are very, very responsive,\" Suleyman said. \"It's on everybody to try and sculpt AI personalities with values that they want to see, they want to use and interact with.\"Suleyman highlighted a feature Microsoft launched last week called real talk, which is a conversation style of Copilot designed to challenge users' perspectives instead of being sycophantic.Suleyman described real talk as sassy and said it had recently roasted him, calling him \"the ultimate bundle of contradictions\" for warning of the dangers of AI in his book while also accelerating its development at Microsoft. \"That was just a magical use case because in some ways I was like, I actually do feel kind of seen by this,\" Suleyman said, noting that AI itself full of contradictions. \"It is both underwhelming in some ways and, at the same time, it's totally magical,\" he said. \"And if you're not afraid by it, you don't really understand it. You should be afraid by it. The fear is healthy. Skepticism is necessary. We don't need unbridled accelerationism.\"WATCH: Microsoft is making money on AI, says Jefferies' Brent Thillwatch now",

    "body": "Former U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris attends the 56th NAACP Image Awards at the Pasadena Civic Auditorium in Pasadena, California, U.S. February 22, 2025.Etienne Laurent | ReutersFormer Vice President Kamala Harris said that during her career, she never took \"no\" for an answer — and attributed much of her success to this attitude.Harris, who served as vice president of the United States under President Joe Biden from 2021 to 2025, shared some candid insights about her early career on Steven Bartlett's Diary of a CEO podcast.When asked what she was like as a 25-year-old prosecutor, Harris responded: \"She was fearless. She didn't hear 'no it can't be done.'\"Harris recalled the first case she had as a young prosecutor: it was a Friday evening, and the person who had been arrested was a young woman with children at home.\"All the courts were shutting down and I went to the courtroom, and I asked the judge: 'Please take the bench again. She has young children. She can't stay in over the weekend,'\" Harris said.\"And the clerk was like: 'no, he's gone for the day. He's leaving for the day.' And I would not leave, and they called the case.\"This persistence has served Harris well throughout her career. She became the first Black, South Asian American, and female vice president after serving as a U.S. senator and attorney general in California.\"Not hearing no, that has probably been a throughline of my life. I don't rest easy with the idea that something is not possible, at least I don't rest easy with the idea without trying to show that it is possible and that's probably not changed,\" she added.In 2024, Harris replaced Biden as the Democratic presidential nominee after he dropped out of the race, but lost to President Donald Trump.Overcoming imposter syndromeHarris admitted that she experienced imposter syndrome in her career, especially when she was first elected district attorney in 2004.\"And there I was, sitting in the office, and I thought: 'Oh my god, I'm now the elected DA of a major city in the United States,'\" the former vice president said on the podcast, adding that she felt a great responsibility in her role.However, she put a positive spin on imposter syndrome, saying there's nothing wrong with having a little humility.\"I think there is a lot that is good with having a certain level of humility, and in particular when the people have vested you with great power, to understand that it's not about you. I think that is part and parcel of what we call imposter syndrome ... I think often it is because they understand how serious the job is on behalf of others, and I applaud a bit of honest humility, not feigned humility, \" she said.At other points in the podcast, Harris recalled walking into meetings and people wondering where her boss was. She said that deprioritizing other people's opinions greatly benefited her.\"When I'm mentoring people, I will often say to them: 'Don't ever limit yourself based on other people's limited ability to see who you are,\" she added.  \"That's their limitation… don't impose those limitations on yourself.\"",

    "body": "The logo of Chinese-owned semiconductor company Nexperia is displayed at the chipmaker's German facility, after the Dutch government seized control and auto industry bodies sounded the alarm over the possible impact on car production, in Hamburg, Germany, Oct. 23, 2025. Jonas Walzberg | ReutersNetherlands-based chipmaker Nexperia is at the heart of a standoff between the European Union, the U.S. and China that has triggered a near-crisis for global automakers.The Dutch government seized control of Nexperia, owned by the Chinese company Wingtech, in October, citing national security concerns. The move prompted Beijing to block Nexperia products from leaving China.Meetings are underway in Europe Saturday to attempt to defuse the escalating issue, and Chinese and U.S. authorities appear to be opening up a pathway for Nexperia's China-based operations to resume exporting critical automotive chips.Spokespeople for the White House and Nexperia did not immediately respond to a request for comment. For now, however, the auto industry's supply chain still hangs in the balance.The dispute is threatening vehicle production worldwide as automakers warn of looming shortages of the chipmaker's components, which are critical to basic electrical functions in cars and challenging to replace on short notice.The battle has unfolded amid heightened scrutiny of Chinese-linked tech firms from Western governments, including the U.S., which recently tightened export-control rules to limit technology transfers to Chinese-owned entities.Nexperia's owner, Wingtech, was put on a U.S. blacklist in December 2024 for its alleged role \"in aiding China's government's efforts to acquire entities with sensitive semiconductor manufacturing capability.\"Here's what to know about where the dispute stands, and why it matters. Why are Nexperia chips so important?Nexperia manufactures billions of so-called foundation chips — transistors, diodes and power management components — that are produced in Europe, assembled and tested in China, and then re-exported to customers in Europe and elsewhere. Around 70% of chips made in the Netherlands are sent to China to be completed and re-exported to other countries.The chips are basic and inexpensive, but are needed in almost every device that uses electricity. In cars, those chips are used to connect the battery to motors, for lights and sensors, for braking systems, airbag controllers, entertainment systems and electric windows. Nexperia had sales of $2 billion last year.In late October, automakers, such as Volkswagen, Nissan Motor and Mercedes-Benz, sounded the alarm about potential production cuts if Nexperia's chip exports are curtailed for long.While automakers typically have some stockpiles and alternative suppliers, it is difficult to switch supply sources overnight. What happened and where do things stand?In September, the Dutch government invoked a Cold War-era law to effectively take control of Nexperia, amid concerns that its Chinese owner was planning to shift intellectual property to another company it owned. A Dutch court also suspended Nexperia CEO, Wingtech founder Zhang Xuezhen, citing mismanagement.Beijing retaliated weeks later by imposing export controls on certain Nexperia products made in China, escalating tensions and fueling fears of a broader supply chain shock. That prompted the company to tell carmakers it could no longer guarantee supplies.But signs of a breakthrough have started to emerge.On Friday, reports said the U.S. plans to announce that Nexperia will resume sending chips under a framework agreement reached during talks between President Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping, citing sources familiar with the matter. And on Saturday, China said it will exempt some Nexperia chips from its export ban. Chinese officials did not specify what those exemptions could entail.\"We will comprehensively consider the actual situation of the enterprise and exempt eligible exports,\" The Chinese Commerce Ministry said in a statement. If finalized, the exemptions could ease immediate pressure on automakers. But the broader dispute over ownership, technology control and security oversight remains unresolved.",

    "body": "The Valero Energy refinery in Texas City, Texas.F. Carter Smith | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesThe focus on dividend stocks is growing, as the U.S. Federal Reserve announced another rate cut. Investors can consider stocks that offer dividends and also have the potential to drive capital appreciation, enhancing the total return.In this regard, recommendations of top Wall Street analysts can help us identify stocks that have solid upside and pay attractive dividends. The stock picks of these experts are backed by in-depth analysis of a company's growth opportunities and ability to pay dividends consistently.Here are three dividend-paying stocks, highlighted by Wall Street's top pros, as tracked by TipRanks, a platform that ranks analysts based on their past performance.Valero EnergyWe start this week with Valero Energy (VLO), a manufacturer of petroleum-based and low-carbon liquid transportation fuels and petrochemical products. In Q3 2025, Valero returned $1.3 billion to stockholders via $351 million in dividends and $931 million in share repurchases. On Oct. 29, Valero declared a quarterly dividend of $1.13 per share. At an annualized dividend of $4.52, VLO stock offers a yield of 2.7%.Valero Energy recently reported upbeat Q3 results, backed by strong refining margins. Keeping in view the Q3 performance, strong refining outlook, and the company's attractive capital returns strategy, Goldman Sachs analyst Neil Mehta reiterated a buy rating on VLO stock and raised his price target to $197 from $180.\"We continue to view VLO as a key beneficiary of our more constructive refining outlook, given the company's balance sheet strength, low-cost operations, and operational execution,\" said Mehta.The 5-star analyst noted that during the third-quarter earnings call, management discussed a constructive refining outlook, driven by limited net capacity additions and widening crude differentials. Mehta also highlighted that Valero's non-refining businesses performed better than Goldman Sachs' expectations. Looking ahead, Mehta believes that low inventories, resilient demand, and limited net refining capacity additions support tighter supply/demand expectations for 2026.In particular, Mehta noted management's continued focus on capital returns and commitment to allocating excess free cash flow to shareholders. The analyst expects a stronger refining backdrop to contribute to meaningful free cash flow generation, which could support about $4.6 billion of capital returns in 2026, implying a 9% capital return yield.Mehta ranks No. 812 among more than 10,000 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been profitable 58% of the time, delivering an average return of 8.7%.AlbertsonsWe move on to the next dividend-paying stock, Albertsons Companies (ACI). The food and drug retailer recently announced upbeat results for the second quarter of fiscal 2025, driven by strong pharmacy sales and digital business. On October 14, Albertsons announced a quarterly dividend of 15 cents per share, payable on November 7. At an annualized dividend of 60 cents per share, ACI stock offers a dividend yield of 3.3%.Following Albertsons' better-than-expected fiscal second-quarter results, Tigress Financial analyst Ivan Feinseth reiterated a buy rating on ACI stock and modestly increased his price target to $29 from $28. The analyst is bullish on Albertsons as the company \"accelerates growth through AI-powered digital sales, expanding loyalty ecosystem, and high-margin retail media platform.\"Feinseth highlighted that Albertsons is transforming from a traditional grocery operator into a data‑driven, digitally integrated food and wellness platform. This change is being fueled by the company's e-commerce expansion, loyalty integration, and rapidly expanding Albertsons Media Collective advertising network, which Feinseth believes is well-positioned to become one of its most profitable long-term growth engines.The top-rated analyst pointed out that ACI's For U loyalty program is driving both digital engagement and spending growth. In fact, For U membership increased more than 13% year-over-year in Q2 FY25, reaching over 48 million active participants. The growing member base boosts ACI's business as members transact more frequently, spend more, and are increasingly using cross-channel rewards, noted Feinseth.Additionally, Feinseth highlighted that Albertsons is enhancing shareholder returns through ongoing dividend increases and share repurchases, including the recently announced additional $750 million accelerated share repurchase authorization. He expects ACI stock to deliver a total return of close to 50%, including dividends.Feinseth ranks No. 296 among more than 10,000 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been profitable 62% of the time, delivering an average return of 14.2%.Williams CompaniesFinally, let's look at energy infrastructure provider Williams Companies (WMB). On October 28, Williams announced a quarterly cash dividend of 50 cents per share, payable on December 29, 2025, and reflecting a 5.3% year-over-year increase. At an annualized dividend of $2 per share, WMB stock offers a 3.5% yield.Ahead of Williams' Q3 results scheduled after the market closes on November 3, RBC Capital analyst Elvira Scotto reiterated a buy rating on WMB stock with a price forecast of $75. In a preview on the Q3 results of the companies in the U.S. midstream space, Scotto stated that Williams and Targa Resources (TRGP) are her favored names into the earnings.Scotto noted that the secular tailwind for natural gas due to rising power demand for electrification and artificial intelligence (AI)/data center growth is driving the need for more energy infrastructure. The 5-star analyst believes that among the stocks within her coverage, \"WMB is best positioned to benefit given its gas transmission asset footprint and its Power Innovation projects.\"Furthermore, Scotto expects WMB to deliver a CAGR (compound annual growth rate) of about 10% in its EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) from 2025 through 2030. The analyst looks forward to additional information on WMB's recently announced Power Innovation projects and any new projects. Scotto expects an uptick in Q3 2025 numbers on a quarter-over-quarter basis across all business segments, with Transmission, Gulf, and Power driving the biggest absolute increase.Scotto views WMB's February analyst day as the next catalyst for the stock. The analyst expects WMB to increase its EBITDA growth target from the range of 5% to 7% to high single digits or more.Scotto ranks No. 270 among more than 10,000 analysts tracked by TipRanks. Her ratings have been successful 64% of the time, delivering an average return of 13.7%.",

    "body": "The U.S. Capitol building, weeks into the continuing U.S. government shutdown, in Washington on Oct. 27, 2025. Kylie Cooper | ReutersOpen enrollment for health insurance bought on the Affordable Care Act marketplace starts Nov. 1 in most states — but millions of people may get a financial surprise when they try to sign up.That's because a congressional deadlock tied to the extension of enhanced subsidies for insurance premiums has continued with no end in sight.Consumers are \"going to get huge sticker shock, because prices are going up,\" said Carolyn McClanahan, a physician and certified financial planner based in Jacksonville, Florida.That sticker shock could have significant ramifications for consumers' finances and the choices they make about health coverage, experts say, contributing to a higher population of uninsured and underinsured consumers and soaring premiums in years to come.While the percentage of Americans who have ACA marketplace health insurance is small, the share could be large enough to swing a close election, KFF reported in October.ACA subsidies at the heart of the government shutdownDuring open enrollment, consumers pick their health plans for the coming year.While open enrollment generally lasts through Jan. 15, there's a Dec. 15 deadline to ensure coverage starts at the beginning of 2026.However, prospective enrollees are in financial limbo.Congress has yet to extend the enhanced subsidies that make insurance premiums cheaper for about 22 million of the 24 million Americans who buy insurance over the ACA exchanges.Recipients' health premiums are set to increase by 114% in 2026, on average, without the enhanced subsidies, according to KFF, a nonpartisan health policy research group.Certain enrollees, such as early retirees with modest incomes, face much larger increases, health experts said.Read more CNBC personal finance coverageThese inherited IRA mistakes could reduce your windfall, advisors sayLayoffs are mounting, making it a 'challenging time to be unemployed': expertWhy travel insurance may not protect you in the government shutdownStudent loan class action effort: Trump official, credit agencies hurt borrowers' scoresTreasury Department: Series I bond rate of 4.03% through April 2026Taxpayers may see 'record tax refund season' in 2026, analysts sayMillions face 'huge sticker shock' when ACA open enrollment starts Nov. 1Here's the maximum 2026 Social Security full retirement benefit, after 2.8% COLAStudent loan forgiveness for public servants to be limited under TrumpDemocrats propose increasing VA, Social Security benefits by $200 a monthAdjustable-rate mortgages are 'underappreciated,' top advisor saysHow the 2026 Social Security payroll tax cap could impact your paycheckWhat this Fed rate cut means for your credit card, mortgage and savings accountHow the Fed's decision to lower rates could widen the generational wealth gapThis investing move is the 'holy grail of retirement planning,' advisor saysCNBC's Financial Advisor 100: Best financial advisors, top firms for 2025 rankedThe enhanced subsidies are at the heart of the federal government shutdown that started Oct. 1. The shutdown is already the second-longest in U.S. history, behind a 35-day shutdown during President Donald Trump's first term.The enhanced subsidies, also known as enhanced premium tax credits, have been available since the Biden administration passed them in 2021 and extended them in 2022. They are scheduled to expire at the end of 2025.Democrats are pushing to extend the subsidies as part of a deal to end the shutdown. Republicans have said they want to negotiate the subsidies separately.More than half, 57%, of ACA marketplace enrollees live in Republican congressional districts, according to a KFF analysis from earlier this month. This year, about 80% of all premium tax credits, or $115 billion, went to ACA marketplace enrollees in states won by President Trump in last year's election, KFF found.There are 39 congressional districts where at least 10% of the population is enrolled in the ACA marketplaces and where, had it not been for enhanced subsidies, their 2024 average premium payments would have been double or more, according to KFF.These districts are largely concentrated in Trump-won states: The bulk, 20, are in Texas, with another seven in Florida and three in Georgia.What this means for open enrollmentAbsent a deal, many people who try to enroll in a health plan via the Affordable Care Act marketplace will see significantly higher premiums during open enrollment, said Cynthia Cox, vice president and director of the ACA program at KFF.The financial stakes vary according to factors such as household income, age and state.For example, the average 60-year-old couple making $85,000 would see their annual premiums increase more than $22,600 in 2026, according to KFF.A 45-year-old earning $20,000 in a state that didn't expand Medicaid would see premiums rise from $0 to $420 per year, on average, it found.Maskot | Getty ImagesThere are many potential implications to the congressional impasse and consumers' sticker shock during open enrollment, Cox said.Many people may opt not to sign up for coverage rather than pay higher premiums, and therefore would be uninsured, Cox said.Others, such as self-employed entrepreneurs and gig workers, may choose to try to find a more traditional job that offers employer-based health insurance so they don't have to sign up for a marketplace plan, Cox said.Some people may opt to buy lower-tier plans that come with smaller upfront premiums but much higher deductibles on the back end, meaning they'd be on the hook for a hefty bill if they need to use their insurance, Cox said.If young, healthy people don't enroll, insurers would be left with a relatively older, less healthy population of enrollees — likely leading insurers to raise their annual premiums even more in the future due to the pool of higher-risk enrollees, she said.The damage may be done, even if Congress does eventually extend the enhanced subsidies, experts said.\"There's certainly a very real possibility that people will log on Nov. 1 and say, 'Gosh, I can't afford that premium,' and they don't come back to look again even if there were a subsequent enactment of enhanced subsidies,\" said Jonathan Burks, executive vice president of health and economic policy at the Bipartisan Policy Center.What prospective ACA enrollees should doAs things stand, enhanced subsidies will expire.Prospective enrollees in an ACA marketplace plan should pick their 2026 health insurance coverage with this in mind, Cox said. In other words, don't pick a plan based on the expectation that Congress will extend the enhanced subsidies, she said.However, she recommends enrollees pay close attention to the news. If Congress reaches a deal, enrollees should come back and look again, because their options and costs may have changed, Cox said.\"If it were me, I'd probably make a note on my calendar to shop over Thanksgiving or in early December,\" with an eye to the Dec. 15 deadline, Cox said.There's certainly a very real possibility that people will log on Nov. 1 and say, 'Gosh, I can't afford that premium.'Jonathan Burksexecutive vice president of health and economic policy at the Bipartisan Policy CenterLuckily, the open enrollment period offers relative flexibility, Burks said.Consumers can pick a plan and select another plan later within the open enrollment period without consequence, he said.\"People shouldn't feel the need to rush into a decision, nor is there a real cost if they make a decision early on, [then] circumstances change and they want to evaluate that decision before the end of the open enrollment period,\" Burks said.Current enrollees who take no action will be reenrolled into the same plan or a similar one if the current plan is no longer available, experts said.How to think through health insurance decisionsEven consumers who are healthy and rarely go to a doctor should have insurance, even a plan with a high deductible, in case there's a major unforeseen health event, said McClanahan, the founder of Life Planning Partners and a member of CNBC's Financial Advisor Council.Those with minor health issues such as hypertension or diabetes and who see a doctor regularly can consider buying a high-deductible plan — which generally carry lower upfront premiums — on the ACA marketplace, she said.Pair that coverage with a direct primary care physician model. Such doctors charge a subscription for care — maybe $150 or $200 a month — and provide all basic primary care such as basic laboratory tests and imaging services, she said.Those with serious illnesses who go to the doctor frequently would be best suited by buying a good health insurance plan with a broad network of doctors and, ideally, a lower deductible, McClanahan said.Of course, this may be challenging for households that lose enhanced subsidies, she said.",

    "body": "A combination image shows an injection pen of Zepbound, Eli Lilly's weight loss drug, and boxes of Wegovy, made by Novo Nordisk. Hollie Adams | ReutersThe appetite for blockbuster weight loss and diabetes drugs is far from satisfied. From fresh competition to new uses, the market is quickly vaulting into a new stage of growth. But factors including insurance coverage, pricing, copycat drugs and the development of new pills will ultimately determine how far the treatments will reach.Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk are still the dominant players, as demand for their weekly injections shows few signs of slowing. Eli Lilly has pulled ahead in the market, saying during its third-quarter earnings call on Thursday that it gained share for the fifth consecutive quarter and that its drugs account for nearly 6 out of 10 prescriptions within the injectable obesity and diabetes class.But both firms are focused on ramping up supply, testing new uses for their medicines and bringing the next wave of obesity drugs to patients, including more convenient pills. Behind them is a slate of drugmakers – from biotech upstarts to pharma giants – racing to win a slice of what some analysts expect could be a roughly $100 billion market by the end of the decade. There may be plenty of room for new entrants: McKinsey projects that 25 million to 50 million U.S. patients could use GLP-1s by 2030. Nearly every major pharmaceutical company has bet on obesity drugs, often through deals with smaller developers, including businesses based in China. While some experimental drugs are further along than others, all are likely years away from hitting the market, and their competitive potential will depend on future data showing their effectiveness and how well patients tolerate them.As competition heats up, many patients are still struggling to access the drugs. Some insurers, including Medicare, don't cover GLP-1s for obesity, which can cost roughly $1,000 per month before rebates.Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk have rolled out discount programs for cash-paying patients to close the gap, and more employers are offering coverage as GLP-1s prove their added health benefits like treating obstructive sleep apnea and chronic kidney disease as well as slashing cardiovascular risks.Still, some patients continue to use cheaper, copycat versions of branded treatments – even though those alternatives are restricted in many cases. While Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly's drugs are no longer in shortage, both companies are cracking down on pharmacies, medspas and other suppliers that mass-produce and market cheaper compounded GLP-1s.While new competitors and lower-cost pills could allow drugs to reach more patients, access will largely depend on how companies like Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly choose to price their drugs in the years ahead.Here's what to know about the state of the booming weight loss drug market. Novo Nordisk scrambles to catch up to LillyDavid Ricks, chief executive officer of Eli Lilly & Co., during a news conference at Generation Park in Houston, Texas, US, on Tuesday, Sept. 23, 2025.Mark Felix | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesEli Lilly has taken the lead in the injectable GLP-1 market. Once the frontrunner, Novo Nordisk lost ground, particularly in the U.S., after supply chain issues, Eli Lilly's emergence and the spread of compounded options.Eli Lilly eclipsed its Danish rival for the first time in May, when it secured 53% of the market during the first quarter. In August, Eli Lilly said its share rose to 57% during the second quarter.  TD Cowen analyst Michael Nedelcovych said that's largely because Eli Lilly's injections are superior to Novo Nordisk's drugs in terms of safety and efficacy. Eli Lilly's diabetes drug Mounjaro is viewed as a better treatment than Novo Nordisk's Ozempic, he noted. Real-world data and a head-to-head clinical trial have shown that Eli Lilly's obesity injection Zepbound leads to more weight loss than Novo Nordisk's Wegovy.\"It's better efficacy, and at least anecdotally in real-world practices, it's better tolerability,\" Nedelcovych said. \"In our business, that's usually all that's required for share gains, and I think we're seeing that play out very quickly.\" Investors have unloaded Novo Nordisk's stock, which has fallen almost 40% this year. Novo Nordisk cut its profit and sales forecast in July, saying compounded drugs had cut into Wegovy's market. The company had already lowered its 2025 outlook in May.As competition mounts, data on Novo Nordisk's experimental medicines also underwhelmed Wall Street and raised concerns about the growth of its drug portfolio beyond Wegovy and Ozempic. In a note in September, BMO Capital Markets analyst Evan Seigerman said the company raised expectations too high for its next-generation obesity drug CagriSema, was slow to launch direct-to-consumer sales of its popular drugs and had a \"tepid initial response\" to compounders selling copycat treatments. What's more, Medicare is negotiating the price of Novo Nordisk's semaglutide – the active ingredient in Ozempic, Wegovy and the company's diabetes pill Rybelsus – effective in 2027, which could further cut into revenue. Eli Lilly's tirzepatide, the active ingredient in Mounjaro and Zepbound, likely won't be subject to price discussions until the end of the decade. Novo Nordisk is betting its new CEO, Mike Doustdar, will help it regain its footing. He took the helm in late July after the board ousted former top executive Lars Fruergaard Jorgensen. Doustdar isn't wasting any time to make changes: Novo Nordisk in September announced plans to cut around 9,000 roles, or roughly 11.5% of its global workforce.There is still turbulence at the pharmaceutical giant. On Tuesday, Novo Nordisk said several board members will step down after clashing with the controlling shareholder, the Novo Nordisk Foundation, on the makeup of the board.The compounding issue Novo Nordisk still faces another major challenge: the persistence of cheaper, compounded versions of semaglutide. The company for now \"is definitely much more vulnerable\" to competition from copycats than Eli Lilly is, largely because most of them contain or claim to be semaglutide, said Cowen's Nedelcovych. He added that Novo Nordisk is \"already on its back foot\" in the market, so it can't afford to lose more share.Patients flocked to compounded GLP-1s when branded injections were in short supply over the last two years, or not covered by their insurance.Compounding is a practice where pharmacies mix ingredients of a drug to create a specialized version tailored to a patient's specific needs, such as those with allergies to certain ingredients. When a branded drug is in short supply, pharmacies are allowed to make larger quantities of compounded versions to help fill the gap.A view shows a Novo Nordisk sign outside its office in Bagsvaerd, on the outskirts of Copenhagen, Denmark, on July 14, 2025.Tom Little | ReutersBut Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly have both invested billions to increase manufacturing capacity for their injections, which has already started to pay off. The FDA declared an end to the shortages of tirzepatide and semaglutide over the last year. Those decisions legally barred compounding pharmacies from making and selling copycats of those drugs by deadlines that passed earlier this year, except in rare cases where it's medically necessary. Novo Nordisk in June said some mass, so-called 503B compounding pharmacies have scaled back production, but accused others — including those tied to Hims & Hers — of continuing to sell the drugs under the \"false guise\" of personalization. In August, Novo Nordisk executives noted that around 1 million U.S. patients are taking compounded GLP-1s.The issue also plagues Eli Lilly. While the FDA regulates 503B pharmacies, most 503A sites fall under state oversight. Nedelcovych likened shutting them down to \"a case of whack-a-mole.\" Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk's lawsuits against telehealth companies, pharmacies and others since 2023 have consumed time and resources, with mixed legal outcomes.The FDA also doesn't appear to be taking an aggressive stance on compounded GLP-1s: The agency in September published a \"green list\" of imported GLP-1 drug ingredients deemed safe to let into the country. Insurance coverage is still spottyLimited insurance coverage for GLP-1s is blocking out patients who can't afford their roughly $1,000 monthly price tags. That access gap has become a political and corporate flashpoint, with pressure mounting on employers and the government to expand coverage.Many health plans, including Medicare, cover GLP-1s for the treatment of diabetes but not obesity. Medicaid coverage of obesity drugs is sparse and varies by state, according to health policy research organization KFF. Coverage for GLP-1s for obesity has ticked up slightly: A May survey of more than 300 companies by the International Foundation of Employee Benefit Plans, or IFEBP, found that 36% provided coverage for GLP-1s for both weight loss and diabetes, up from 34% in 2024. Still, many employers and health plans remain hesitant due to high costs. In 2025, weight-loss GLP-1s accounted for an average of 10.5% of total annual claims among employers, up from 8.9% in 2024 and 6.9% in 2023, IFEBP found.\"If employers weren't already on board before, they're still waiting,\" said Julie Stich, vice president of content at IFEBP. \"The cost issue is still a major, major issue for them.\"Some plans are concerned that patients won't stay on the drugs long term due to gastrointestinal side effects, such as nausea and vomiting, and could regain the weight they lost, said John Crable, senior vice president of Corporate Synergies, a national insurance and employee benefits brokerage and consultancy. Employers, which can experience high turnover, are also hesitant to cover costly drugs for workers who may leave the company within a few years, Crable added.Crable added that new direct-to-consumer programs from Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk — which let patients pay cash for treatments at less than half their monthly list price — may also discourage employer coverage.Stitch said employers also have questions about how oral obesity drugs, which could be available as soon as 2025, could affect demand and costs.But she said coverage could still grow, especially as GLP-1s gain new approvals for more chronic conditions. Wegovy is cleared for reducing cardiovascular risk and fatty liver disease, while Zepbound is approved for sleep apnea.Novo Nordisk is also testing semaglutide in Alzheimer's, with initial late-stage trial results expected this year. If that study shows that GLP-1s reduce the risk of cognitive decline, \"it would give a big boost\" to Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly because it could encourage patients to stay on them longer, said Leerink Partners analyst David Risinger.\"You're paying for the GLP-1 drug with the hope that obesity or these other conditions will improve, so that health-care costs for these individual employees will get better as you move forward,\" Stich said.Some plans have also introduced cost controls, like BMI thresholds, to manage spending.Stich added that broader Medicare coverage could eventually drive private insurers to follow suit. The Trump administration plans to pilot coverage of weight loss drugs under Medicare and Medicaid, which could expand access to millions of older Americans, the Washington Post reported in August.All eyes are on pillsMalerapaso | Istock | Getty ImagesWhile Novo Nordisk already sells an oral GLP-1 for diabetes, the company and Eli Lilly could soon bring pills specifically for weight loss to patients.Some experts and analysts believe they could fundamentally shift the market, helping more patients access treatment and alleviating the supply shortfalls of existing injections. But others raise questions about how much of a role pills will play in the space given that some appear to be less effective than injections and bring greater side effects.Novo Nordisk's 25-milligram oral semaglutide could win approval for obesity by the end of the year, which would make it the first needle-free alternative for weight loss on the market. The daily pill appears to be slightly more effective than a competing oral GLP-1 from Eli Lilly called orforglipron, based on data from separate phase three trials. Still, Eli Lilly's pill could have a few notable advantages. Both drugs work by mimicking the GLP-1 gut hormone to suppress appetite and regulate blood sugar. But while Novo Nordisk's pill is a peptide medication, orforglipron is a small-molecule drug.That means Eli Lilly's treatment is absorbed more easily in the body and doesn't require dietary restrictions like Novo Nordisk's does. Some analysts say orforglipron will also be easier to manufacture at scale than Novo Nordisk's, which is crucial as demand for obesity and diabetes injections outpaces supply. In August, Eli Lilly CEO David Ricks told CNBC the company hopes to launch its pill globally \"this time next year.\" In an August note, Goldman Sachs analysts forecast daily oral pills will capture 24% share — or around $22 billion — of the 2030 global weight loss drug market, which they expect to be worth $95 billion. The Goldman analysts said they expect Eli Lilly's pill to have a 60% share — or roughly $13.6 billion — of the market for daily oral treatments in 2030. They expect Novo Nordisk's oral semaglutide to have a 21% share — or around $4 billion — of that segment. The remaining 19% slice will go to other emerging pills, the analysts said.TD Cowen's Nedelcovych said he has been \"treading kind of cautiously\" in his outlook for oral weight loss drugs. He said that's in part because physician consultants and other experts believe injections, which are more effective and easier to tolerate than pills, will dominate the market for the foreseeable future. Nedelcovych said the convenience of a once-daily pill may not be enough to convince patients to switch, since some of them \"really don't mind\" taking an injection once a week. Nedelcovych added that tapering off injections and switching to pills as a maintenance regimen \"also doesn't seem to make a ton of sense, when we ask physicians about it.\" He said if pills are less effective at promoting weight loss, it raises concerns that patients who initially lose significant weight on an injection could gain some back after switching to an oral drug.  A phase three study from Eli Lilly, which is studying orforglipron's ability to maintain weight loss, will bring more clarity on that issue. Companies have said that pills could reach patients who don't take injections because they are afraid of needles. But Nedelcovych said the \"fate of oral weight loss therapies could really revolve\" around another category of people: patients who could benefit from weight loss treatments but don't take injections because they believe they are meant for those with serious diseases.\"They're really just invisible to the marketplace right now,\" he said. \"But they could have different views about an oral therapy, which could be considered more like a vitamin so they would be more amenable to taking that.\" The question top of mind for health experts is how companies will price the pills. \"If it wasn't for the fact that they can be made more cheaply, I wouldn't care\" about pills, said Dr. Caroline Apovian, co-director of the Center for Weight Management and Wellness at Brigham and Women's Hospital.The direct-to-consumer platforms from Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk offer Zepbound and Wegovy for roughly $500 a month. She said less effective pills with more side effects will have to be priced lower than that if companies want health-care providers to prescribe them first over injections. Competition is creeping up It's still unclear who will be the next viable player to enter the weight loss drug space. Many experimental drugs from other companies may not reach patients until the end of the decade. Still, some drugmakers have made strides over the last year and a half, inking deals with obesity biotechs or releasing promising data on experimental treatments. Several companies are trying to drive innovation with new drugs that promote weight loss differently, are taken less frequently or preserve muscle mass, among other changes. Some investors are eager to see a drug that promotes even more weight loss than Wegovy and Zepbound, which has hit those companies' stocks when their treatments don't meet lofty expectations in clinical trials. But some health experts say many patients don't need to lose more than 20% of their weight. \"I am not even looking for greater weight loss anymore. What is wrong with 16% and 22% weight loss? Nothing, right?\" said Apovian, referring to the levels of weight loss seen with some existing and experimental drugs. Apovian said she is looking for treatments that target new gut hormones, which could address patients who may not lose weight on GLP-1s. She pointed to drugs targeting amylin analogs – an emerging form of weight loss treatment that mimics a hormone co-secreted with insulin in the pancreas to suppress appetite and reduce food intake.Several drugmakers, including Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly, are betting on amylin analogs as part of the next wave of obesity treatmentsOther experts have said that an ideal competitor would promote weight loss while being easier to tolerate than existing injections. That's because many people discontinue those injections – and may not experience the full health benefits – due to gastrointestinal side effects such as nausea and vomiting. Without late-stage trial data on any of the new competitors, it's too early to say who will be able to address that issue.The Amgen logo is displayed outside Amgen headquarters on May 17, 2023 in Thousand Oaks, California.Mario Tama | Getty ImagesSome drugs are much closer to answering that question than others. For example, Amgen in March said it has started two critical late-stage trials for its experimental weight loss injection MariTide, which is designed to be taken monthly or even less frequently and promotes weight loss differently from competitors. In a mid-stage study, patients with obesity taking MariTide lost up to 16.2% of their weight in one year when analyzing all participants regardless of discontinuations, or up to 19.9% when only analyzing those who stayed on the treatment. But patients experienced a high rate of side effects and discontinuations in the trial. Those results support the company's decision to use a slower dosing schedule over eight weeks to make the drug more tolerable in phase three studies. Some pharmaceutical companies have turned to China for their obesity bets. For example, Merck in December snagged the rights to an early-stage experimental GLP-1 pill from Chinese drugmaker Hansoh Pharma, in a deal worth up to $2 billion. That acquisition and other smaller players raised questions about the fate of public U.S.-based obesity biotechs such as Viking Therapeutics, which were once seen as hot takeover targets. Some analysts argue that their experimental drugs, most of which are still in mid-stage development, have not differentiated themselves enough from existing treatments. \"Unless and until these molecules show that they truly are differentiated in phase three, I don't think there's really a reason for given pharma to lay out a large transaction to gain access to it,\" said TD Cowen's Nedelcovych. He said the \"clearest path forward\" for U.S.-based obesity biotechs is likely inking partnerships with larger firms to develop and commercialize their drugs.But Nedelcovych noted that \"there really aren't too many large pharmas who aren't already spoken for at this point.\"",

    "body": "Robots manufacture auto parts at a factory in Ningde, China, on Oct. 17, 2024.Nurphoto | Nurphoto | Getty ImagesChina's factory activity growth in October missed market expectations, dragged down by a sharper drop in new export orders, as trade tensions with the U.S. intensified during the month, according to a private survey released Monday.The RatingDog China General Manufacturing PMI, compiled by S&P Global, dropped to 50.6 in October from the six-month high of 51.2 in September, missing analysts' expectations of 50.9 in a Reuters poll.New export orders fell at the quickest pace since May, which the survey respondents attributed to \"rising trade uncertainty.\" New business and output both expanded at slower rates in October compared to the previous month, with business confidence slipping to its lowest level in six months, the survey showed. \"When assessing the one-year outlook for production, firms were the least upbeat in six months,\" it said.A gauge on employment at the factories, however, showed the first expansion since March, rising to the highest level since August 2023.Staying above the 50-benchmark that separates growth from contraction, the private survey numbers were better compared to the official survey released last Friday that showed manufacturing activity falling to 49.0, its worst contraction in six months. Private surveys, previously conducted by Caixin and S&P Global, have usually painted a better picture than official polls over the past years as they have focused more on export-oriented manufacturers.The RatingDog private survey covers 650 manufacturers and collects responses in the second half of each month while the official PMI surveys a larger sample of over 3,000 companies at month-end.With the extension of the U.S.-China trade truce and expected recovery in export orders, the manufacturing PMI is likely to rebound modestly in the coming months as business confidence stabilizes, said Dongming Xie, managing director and head of Asia macro research at OCBC Bank.China and the U.S. reached a trade truce last week following a meeting between American President Donald Trump and his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, in South Korea, stabilizing relations after an escalating trade battle that had sparked fears of a global economic downturn.Under the agreement, the U.S. will lower the fentanyl-linked tariffs on Chinese goods by half to 10%, taking the total rate on Chinese goods to around 47%, in response to China pausing its sweeping export controls on rare earth metals.The U.S. will suspend the implementation of the 50% ownership \"penetration rule\" under export controls and the Section 301 investigation into China's maritime, logistics and shipbuilding sectors.watch nowBeijing will also terminate antitrust and anti-dumping investigations targeting American chip companies, including those into Nvidia Corp and Qualcomm Inc, the White House said on Saturday. Beijing will also resume purchases of American soybeans and other agricultural and energy products.Goldman Sachs raised its forecast for China's GDP for 2025 last week, encouraged by the U.S. trade detente and Beijing's determination to advance manufacturing competitiveness and further boost exports. The Wall Street bank expects China's real GDP growth to reach 5% this year, 4.8% in 2026, up from 4.9% and 4.3%, respectively.Chinese manufacturers have sought to diversify their export markets since the start of the year to rely less on the U.S. and more on Southeast Asia and European markets. Chinese exports to the U.S. have declined by double digits year-over-year every month since April, falling  of this year compared to the same period last year.That decline was largely offset by increased exports to Southeast Asia, which have jumped 14.7% this year as of September, the European Union, which rose 8.2%, and Africa, which grew over 28%. China's overall exports grew 6.1% in the first three quarters this year, while imports fell 1.1%.Despite resilient exports, the world's second-largest economy has shown fresh signs of strain, with growth slowing to 4.8% in the third quarter, its slowest in a year. Fixed-asset investment, which includes real estate, unexpectedly contracted 0.5% in the first nine months of the year, the first such decline since pandemic-hit 2020.The high base in the fourth quarter last year — with a 5.4% GDP growth — on the back of a blitz of stimulus measures in September will weigh heavily on the growth rate for the current quarter, Neo Wang, China strategist at Evercore ISI, said in a note on Sunday.The fading effect of government consumption subsidies and the protracted housing downturn will also continue to suppress growth for next year, Wang added.",

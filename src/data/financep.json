    "body": "New York Attorney General Letitia James speaks to the media, after she attended a hearing and pleaded not guilty to charges that she defrauded her mortgage lender, outside the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, in Norfolk, Virginia, U.S., Oct. 24, 2025. Jonathan Ernst | ReutersFederal prosecutors on Thursday for the second time failed to convince a grand jury in Virginia to re-indict New York Attorney General Letitia James on criminal charges, according to multiple reports.The Department of Justice tried to obtain a new indictment of James over the past two weeks, after a federal judge dismissed the original indictment in the Eastern District of Virginia, charging her with bank fraud and making false statements to a financial institution in connection with a mortgage. James denies any wrongdoing.It is extremely unusual for a grand jury to refuse to issue an indictment after a prosecutor requests one.James' indictment and another one in the same district against former FBI Director James Comey were both tossed out after Judge Cameron Currie ruled that Lindsey Halligan, the interim top prosecutor in the Eastern District, had been invalidly appointed to the post.Halligan has presented the evidence against James and Comey to separate grand juries.President Donald Trump had called for both James and Comey to be prosecuted. Halligan is his former personal lawyer.James' defense lawyer, Abbe Lowell, in a statement said, \"For the second time in seven days, the Department of Justice has failed in its clear attempt to fulfill President Trump's political vendetta against Attorney General James.\"\"This unprecedented rejection makes even clearer that this case should never have seen the light of day,\" Lowell said. \"Career prosecutors who knew better refused to bring it, and now two different grand juries in two different cities have refused to allow these baseless charges to be brought.\"\"This case already has been a stain on this Department's reputation and raises troubling questions about its integrity,\" he said. \"Any further attempt to revive these discredited charges would be a mockery of our system of justice.\"Read more CNBC politics coverageTrump officials move to end student loan payment pause for millions of borrowersJudge unseals Ghislaine Maxwell grand jury materials, citing Epstein files actUkraine at 'critical moment' in war as European allies ramp up pressure on RussiaDemocrats establish AI working group as industry bolsters DC presenceEx-Trump lawyer Habba resigns as NJ U.S. attorney after disqualificationTrump announces $12 billion aid package for farmers caught up in trade warTrump says Netflix, WBD deal could be 'problem' as son-in-law backs Paramount bidSupreme Court to hear case on Trump birthright citizenship orderTrump can fire labor, employment board members without cause: Appeals courtTrump administration views Netflix, Warner Bros. deal with 'heavy skepticism'Costco adds Biden Commerce Sec.

But the same court upheld the ruling that Trump engaged in business fraud.The DOJ manual says, \"Once a grand jury returns a no-bill or otherwise acts on the merits in declining to return an indictment, the same matter ( i.e., the same transaction or event and the same putative defendant) should not be presented to another grand jury or resubmitted to the same grand jury without first securing the approval of the responsible United States Attorney.\"This is developing news.

    "body": "US Federal Reserve Board Chairman Jerome Powell speaks during a news conference following a Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting in Washington, DC, on Dec. 10, 2025.Saul Loeb | AFP | Getty ImagesIn the Federal Reserve's battle between fighting inflation and limiting unemployment, the latter side carried the day Wednesday and could also have an edge heading into 2026 if labor market weakness becomes more evident through an apparent overcounting of jobs numbers.In the immediate term, worries over the employment situation meant a vote, albeit divided by a 9-3 margin, to lower the central bank's key interest rate by a quarter percentage point. Down the road, there are indications that policymakers will be more inclined to cut further if the labor market stays soft. At his Wednesday news conference, Chair Jerome Powell mentioned several times that there likely has been negative job growth in recent months, a condition that would argue for easier monetary policy.\"Gradual cooling in the labor market has continued,\" Powell said. \"Surveys of households and businesses both show declining supply and demand for workers. So, I think you can say that the labor market has continued to cool gradually, just a touch more gradually than we thought.\"At issue is a monthly estimate the Bureau of Labor Statistics performs of how the labor market is affected by businesses closing and opening. The estimate, known as the birth-death model, takes a guess at the jobs gained by openings and lost by closings.Powell said the model has probably overstated jobs by about 60,000 per month since April. With job growth averaging just shy of 40,000 in that period, an overstatement that size would equate to payroll losses of about 20,000 per month.Powell urges cautionThe chair called the discrepancy \"something of a systematic overcount\" that likely will see big revisions to job growth numbers.In September, the BLS released a preliminary benchmark estimate that job growth was overstated by 911,000 in the 12-month period preceding March 2025. A final count is scheduled to come out in February.In \"a world where job creation is negative, I just think we need to watch that situation very carefully and be in a position where we're not pushing down job creation with our policy,\" Powell said.Balancing support for the labor market with keeping inflation under control will be central to policymaking as the Fed enters 2026. Officials at this week's Federal Open Market Committee meeting expressed a broad divergence of opinion on where rates should head. Six of the 19 participants said they opposed the latest rate cut — two of them were among the 12 who vote — and seven indicated they don't see the need for any reductions next year, according to the \"dot plot\" of individual expectations.On the other side are those who think there is at least some room for further easing. That would point to greater concerns about the labor market, even as inflation holds above the Fed's 2% target. However, Powell said much of the inflation overshoot is coming from President Donald Trump's tariffs, whose impact is expected to wane as the months go on.Market sees more cutsShould the view hold that inflation is subsiding and the labor market is stumbling, the Fed would then be expected to tilt toward an easing bias, particularly with Powell leaving his position as chair in May. \"With the Fed's most influential members keeping a keen eye on the unemployment rate, we think that as long as labor demand wanes and [the] unemployment rate increases, the path will be cleared for additional cuts, despite the vocal opposition from the hawks,\" Natixis economist Christopher Hodge said in a note.\"Because we see the unemployment rate rising through Q1 2026, we think the Fed will continuing cutting to arrest further softening in the labor market,\" Hodge added, noting that \"we think a cut in January is more likely than not.\"Stocks rallied Wednesday and Thursday amid hopes that the rhetoric out of the FOMC was not as hawkish as feared. Still, futures market pricing is indicating the next cut won't come until at least April. Traders also are putting odds on two reductions in 2026, which is more aggressive than the dot-plot indication of one, with even a 41% probability of three moves, according to the CME Group's FedWatch measure.",

    "body": "Customers walk in the parking lot outside a Costco store on Dec. 2, 2025 in Chicago, Illinois. Scott Olson | Getty ImagesCostco on Thursday surpassed Wall Street's quarterly expectations and posted year-over-year sales growth of 8.2% as the retailer attracted more digital sales and opened new locations.The warehouse club does not share a full-year outlook. On the company's earnings call, CFO Gary Millerchip said e-commerce gains were one of the strengths of the quarter. Digital sales jumped by 20.5% year over year. Traffic on its website increased 24% year over year and traffic on its app shot up 48%. Same-day delivery service offered through Instacart in the U.S. and Uber and DoorDash internationally grew at a faster pace than overall digital sales.Costco had a positive start to the busiest weeks of the holiday season, too. Millerchip said Black Friday was a record-breaking day for the warehouse club's U.S. e-commerce business, generating over $250 million in non-food orders.Here's how Costco did in its fiscal first quarter compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:Earnings per share: $4.50 vs. $4.27 expectedRevenue: $67.31 billion vs. $67.14 billion expectedCostco has attracted new members and higher sales at its clubs and online as U.S. consumers across incomes seek value while shopping for groceries, household essentials, holiday gifts and more. Along with its warehouse club competitors, Costco has gained traction with younger customers who are signing up for memberships. Costco has also benefitted from a membership fee increase in the U.S. and Canada, which took effect in September 2024, and kicked in as new members signed up or as existing customers' renewed their annual memberships when they lapsed.In the three-month period that ended Nov. 23, Costco's net income rose to $2 billion, or $4.50 per share, from $1.80 billion, or $4.04 per share, in the year-ago quarter. Revenue increased to $67.31 billion from $62.15 billion in the year-ago quarter.Comparable sales, an industry metric that takes out the impact of one-time factors like store openings and closures, increased 5.9% in the U.S. and 6.4% across the globe. Sales in non-food were led by pharmacy, gold and jewelry, tires, small electrics and apparel, which grew by double-digits year-over-year, Millerchip said.In the first quarter, Costco opened eight new warehouse clubs, including a relocation in Canada, its third location in France, four new locations in the U.S. and two additional Canadian business centers, CEO Ron Vachris said on the company's earnings call. Business centers tend to sell bulk items intended for restaurants and other types of businesses. Those additional locations bring its total store count to 921 around the world.He said the company plans to continue to open 30 or more clubs per year in future years.Read moreAs a warehouse club, Costco relies on membership fees to boost its revenue and help keep the price of its items low. With higher tariffs, however, the retailer has dealt with rising costs. About a third of Costco's U.S. sales come from imported goods.Inflation \"remained relatively consistent with recent quarters,\" Millerchip said. He said in grocery, Costco saw higher inflation in commodities such as beef, seafood and coffee, but that was offset by lower inflation in eggs, cheese, butter and produce. In non-food, he said Costco saw low single-digit inflation for the third consecutive quarter, primarily driven by gold and imported goods. Millerchip said on the earnings call that Costco has looked for ways to reduce the impact of the duties, including sourcing more items from the U.S., consolidating buying across the globe to lower the cost of goods and swapping out categories or items to ones that aren't as exposed to steep tariff costs.Its private label, Kirkland Signature, is another way to offset tariff prices because it has more control over the supply chain, he said.In late November, Costco sued the Trump administration to get a full refund of new tariffs that it has paid so far this year and to block those import duties from being collected from the company as it waits for a Supreme Court ruling on the duties.As of the end of the quarter, Costco had 81.4 million total paid members, up 5.2% year over year and 145.9 million cardholders, up 5.1% year over year, Millerchip said. Its renewal rate in the U.S. and Canada was 92.2% and its worldwide rate was 89.7%, slipping a bit as more customers sign up for memberships online and those members renew at a slightly lower rate.As of Thursday's close, Costco's shares have declined nearly 4% so far this year. That trails the S&P 500's 17% gains during the same period. However, over the past five years, Costco's stock has jumped by 141%. The company's stock closed at $884.48 on Thursday, bringing its market value to $392.67 billion.",

    "body": "Calvin McDonald, CEO of lululemon athletica inc., is interviewed by CNBC on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York City, U.S., March 29, 2023. Brendan Mcdermid | ReutersLululemon announced Thursday its CEO Calvin McDonald will step down effective Jan. 31 following more than a year of underperformance at the athleisure company. The company's board of directors is working with a \"leading executive search firm\" to identify its next CEO, it said in a news release. McDonald will stay on as a senior advisor through March 31. \"The timing is right for a change,\" McDonald said on a call with analysts, \"I've described being CEO of Lululemon as my dream job. It truly has lived up to every expectation and given me the opportunity of a lifetime.\"Lululemon's CFO Meghan Frank and Chief Commercial Officer André Maestrini will serve as interim co-CEOs during the search process. The company's board chair Marti Morfitt will also take on the expanded role of executive chair. In a statement, she said the company has a strong foundation in place but needs a new leader that can guide it through a transition.\"As we look to the future, the Board is focused on identifying a leader with a track record of driving companies through periods of growth and transformation to guide the company's next chapter of success,\" said Morfitt.Shares rose about 10% in extended trading. The leadership change follows more than a year of underperformance at Lululemon and calls for change from its founder and its largest independent shareholder Chip Wilson. Two months ago, he took out a full page ad in the Wall Street Journal saying the company is \"in a nosedive\" and it needed to \"stop chasing Wall Street at the expense of customers.\" Lululemon announced McDonald's departure on the same day it posted fiscal third-quarter earnings and another round of weak guidance. Here's how the company did compared with what Wall Street was anticipating, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:Earnings per share: $2.59 vs. $2.25 expectedRevenue: $2.57 billion vs. $2.48 billion expectedThe company's reported net income for the three-month period that ended Nov. 2 was $306.84 million, or $2.59 per share, compared with $351.87 million, or $2.87 per share, a year earlier. Sales rose to $2.57 billion, up from $2.40 billion a year earlier. For Lululemon's current quarter, McDonald said the company is \"encouraged\" by its early performance so far this holiday season — though guidance fell short of Wall Street estimates. It anticipates sales will be between $3.50 billion and $3.59 billion, largely below expectations of $3.60 billion, according to LSEG. It's expecting earnings per share to be between $4.66 and $4.76, well short of expectations of $5.03, according to LSEG. In the previous two quarters, Lululemon cut its full-year guidance. On Thursday, more than a month into the final quarter of the year, it raised its full-year expectations again. It now anticipates sales will be between $10.96 billion and $11.05 billion, in line with expectations at the low end, according to LSEG. It expects earnings per share to be between $12.92 and $13.02, roughly in line with estimates of about $13, according to LSEG. The company saw strong demand during its Thanksgiving weekend, which allowed it to clear through stale inventory at a discount, said McDonald. \"I also want to acknowledge we've seen trends slow a bit since Thanksgiving, which we've taken into account in our Q4 guidance,\" said McDonald. \"However, despite this, we expect revenue trends in the U.S. and Q4 to be modestly improved relative to Q3.\" Lululemon's business has been under pressure over the last year as it navigates the impact of tariffs, a shaky U.S. consumer and a product assortment that's failed to wow shoppers in the same way it once did. It's also facing steep competition in the athleisure space from upstarts like Vuori and Alo Yoga as well as a change in consumer preferences. Instead of yoga pants, these days many shoppers are reaching for denim. To drive growth and reach a wider audience, Lululemon has been working to expand its business internationally and offer shoppers a wider assortment. Instead of just workout gear, Lululemon has expanded into shoes, outerwear like coats and jackets and casual pants that can be worn at work. The company's overall business is growing, but the expansion has largely come from its international business and new store openings. Its largest market, the Americas, has been declining. During the quarter, revenue in the Americas decreased 2%, with comparable sales down 5%, while international sales jumped 33%. Comparable sales abroad increased 18%. Lululemon is also being hit by the end of the de minimis exemption, which allowed low value packages to enter the U.S. duty free, a bit more acutely than its peers. In September, it said it expects tariffs to hit its full year profits by $240 million and most of those costs will come from the de minimis exemption ending. Following progress with vendor negotiations and other mitigation efforts, it now expects tariffs to reduce its profits by $210 million.

Eighty-seven Democrats joined every Republican in the House to support the bill. The wide-ranging package of legislation would allow more investors access to private markets. Lawmakers say the measure will help more companies go public and increase capital formation for startups.Instead of only wealth or income determining who can be an accredited investor, investors could become accredited by taking an exam approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission.House Financial Services Chairman French Hill, R-Ark., said the bill was needed in part because of the decrease in the number of public companies in America. \"We make it easier to be a public company in America,\" Hill said on the House floor during debate on the bill. \"\"We make it easier, if you have a great idea, to crowdsource that idea, to raise money from friends and family. And we make it easier, if you're an individual investor, to have other opportunities in which to invest.\"The bill also would lift the cap for how much venture capital firms can raise, and how many people can invest, before they are subject to stricter disclosure and compliance regulations.The bill increases the number of investors to 500 from 250, and increases funds to $50 million from $10 million. It also would become easier for venture capital firms to invest in each other  — a change lawmakers say will help more funds reach companies in places like the Midwest and the South. Rep. Bill Huizenga, R-Mich., said that unicorn companies  — privately held startups with a valuation of $1 billion or more  — used to be rare. Now, he said there are \"herds of unicorns\" which limit investing opportunities for the public. \"We're trying to make sure that this is open and accessible to folks, and I think that's going to be a healthier approach for both the public markets and the private markets,\" Huizenga said. The bill now heads to the Senate, where making capital formation easier is on Banking Committee Chair Tim Scott's to-do list. It is not clear if the Senate will take up the House package, move individual pieces of it, or try to do its own bill. ",

The change takes effect after the market close on April 8, resetting a fund launched in 2008 that has just $23 million in assets. Alongside the new name, the ETF will adopt a revamped benchmark index and a broad investment mandate meant to capture what VanEck calls the emerging \"Degen Economy.\"\"Degen,\" short for \"degenerate,\" originated in gambling circles and later migrated into crypto and retail-trading communities as a tongue-in-cheek label for people making high-risk, often impulsive bets.The original gaming ETF targeted casinos, sports betting, lottery services and gaming players. Now the Degen ETF is expanding into companies earning at least 50% of revenue from \"Millennial Finance\" and \"Gig Economy and Online Forums.\"\"Millennial Finance\" includes digital brokerages, neobanks, crypto exchanges and BNPL or buy now, pay later providers. \"Gig Economy and Online Forums\" targets ride-hailing, delivery apps, freelance marketplaces and community platforms.The VanEck Gaming ETF is up only about 3% this year, significantly trailing the S&P 500.",

    "body": "A home is shown for sale in The Heights in Houston, Monday, Oct. 27, 2025.Kirk Sides | Houston Chronicle | Getty ImagesHome prices have finally come down compared with last year, though just fractionally, according to daily reads from Parcl Labs, which looks at high-frequency listing data on single-family homes, condos and townhomes, both new and existing. They may stay softer, though, as home prices are down 1.4% in just the last three months.On a national level, home prices have not gone negative since mid-2023, a year after the Federal Reserve first brought rates up from zero, and mortgage rates moved sharply higher. From March 2022 to June 2023, the average rate on the popular 30-year fixed mortgage went from 3.9% to just over 7%, according to Mortgage News Daily. But even then, prices were negative on a year-over-year basis for just a few months. It was nothing like the great financial crisis when home prices dropped 27% from their peak in 2006 to their trough in 2012, according to the S&P Case-Shiller National Home Price Index. \"More recently we have seen a period of national softness emerging after the rapid run-up during the Covid years, 2020 to 2022,\" said Jason Lewris, co-founder of Parcl Labs. \"The sharp increase in mortgage rates in 2022 and 2023 created an affordability shock: buyers were priced out, sales volumes dropped, and sellers had to adjust expectations. Historically, that combination of a credit or affordability shock, weaker demand, and more inventory than the market can easily absorb is what tends to produce broad national price declines.\"Inventory today is still historically low, but it has come off its near-record lows of recent years. Active listings in November were nearly 13% higher than November 2024, but new listings were just 1.7% higher, according to Realtor.com. Sellers are also pulling their homes off the market at an unusually high rate. Prices nationally are down less than 1%, but certain markets are seeing more significant drops: Prices in Austin, Texas, are down 10% from last year; in Denver, they're down 5%, according to Parcl Labs. Tampa, Florida, and Houston both saw prices fall 4%, and Atlanta and Phoenix saw price decreases of 3%.There are also markets seeing gains: in Cleveland, prices gained 6%; Chicago and New York City both saw price increases of 5%; Philadelphia saw prices rise 3%; and Pittsburgh and Boston both saw 2% price gains, according to Parcl. Get Property Play directly to your inboxCNBC's Property Play with Diana Olick covers new and evolving opportunities for the real estate investor, delivered weekly to your inbox.Subscribe here to get access today.While other home price indexes and surveys measure just existing home values, this one measures both new and existing. There has been no government data on housing starts, building permits or sales of newly built homes since before the government shutdown started, so it's difficult to paint any kind of supply picture in the price forecast. That said, builders reporting quarterly earnings have indicated that demand is still relatively weak and incentives are still necessary. Homebuilder sentiment is still well into negative territory.\"We continue to see demand-side weakness as a softening labor market and stretched consumer finances are contributing to a difficult sales environment,\" said Robert Dietz, NAHB's chief economist, in a November release. \"After a decline for single-family housing starts in 2025, NAHB is forecasting a slight gain in 2026 as builders continue to report future sales conditions in marginally positive territory.\" Mortgage rates have not moved much in the last three months, and had very little reaction to the latest Federal Reserve rate cut Wednesday. Home prices, therefore, are unlikely to do much either. \"Our base case from here is not a deep national downturn, but a period where prices hover around zero, with small positive or small negative year over year changes, rather than the double digit gains of the pandemic era,\" said Lewris. \"How far they move in either direction will depend mainly on mortgage rates and the broader health of the economy.\" ",

    "body": "watch nowPresident Donald Trump is willing to seize more oil tankers off the coast of Venezuela, a White House official told CNBC on Thursday. The U.S. seized a tanker on Wednesday that had allegedly transported oil from Venezuela to Iran. The action comes as Trump escalates pressure on President Nicolás Maduro. The White House official told CNBC that the Trump administration is always looking to enforce the law. The oil market has been focused on Ukraine peace talks and so far is not indicating a risk of a major supply disruption. U.S. crude oil fell 86 cents, or 1.47%, to close at $57.60 a barrel. Global benchmark Brent settled at $61.28, down 93 cents, or 1.49%. Sources told Reuters earlier that U.S. is expected to target more ships transporting Venezuelan crude in the coming weeks. The Treasury Department updated its Venezuela sanctions list on Thursday to include more than a dozen additional people, companies and tankers. The tanker seized on Wednesday was a Very Large Crude Carrier, or VLCC, identified as the Skipper, Matt Smith, head U.S. analyst at energy consulting firm Kpler, told CNBC. It was loaded covertly with 1.1 million barrels in mid-November and appeared on course for Cuba, Smith said.The tanker will be taken to a U.S. port and the oil will be seized, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters on Thursday. \"However, there is a legal process for the seizure of that oil, and that legal process will be followed,\" Leavitt said. The tanker seizure comes amid a major U.S. military buildup in the Caribbean. The Trump administration has launched a series of deadly strikes in recent months on boats that it says were trafficking drugs to the U.S. Those strikes have been the subject of intense scrutiny in Congress over their legality. Venezuela is a founding member of OPEC and has the largest proven oil reserves in the world. It is exporting about 749,000 barrels per day this year, with at least half that oil going to China, according to data from Kpler.",

    "body": "watch nowTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Thursday proposed a major change in how the government approaches financial regulation and stability.In a letter released Thursday afternoon, Bessent will recommended altering the approach of the Financial Stability Oversight Council.Whereas the agency's focus had been tightening regulations and oversight of the institutions it oversees, the new plan will switch that, and push for looser regulation and a freer approach.\"[T]he Council will work with and support member agencies in considering whether aspects of the U.S. financial regulatory framework impose undue burdens and negatively impact economic growth, thereby undermining financial stability,\" the letter states.Bessent further noted that the impact of additional regulations is assessed \"in isolation,\" not in how it impacts the economy broadly.\"The cumulative burdens of regulatory and supervisor regimes, and the interactions among individual rules, are rarely considered,\" he said.FSOC was formed in the wake of the financial crisis of 2008 to monitor and address the kind of systemic risk that led to the collapse of major Wall Street institutions and sent the economy into its worst slump since the Great Depression. The council was created in 2010 as an outgrowth of efforts to prevent such a crisis from happening again.As Treasury secretary, Bessent chairs the council. The proposal coincides with an FSOC meeting slated for Thursday at which he delivers a letter updating where it stands on its work.The plan also lines up with the Trump administration's focus on deregulation, but represents a switch from the council's long-standing tilt toward stronger regulation. Along with the proposal, Bessent is forming a working group whose mission will be to \"explore opportunities for [artificial intelligence] to promote the resilience of the financial system while also monitoring for potential risks to financial stability that might be posed by the adoption of AI.\"Bessent will contend that lowering regulator barriers and oversight will strengthen the financial system and boost economic growth.",

The back of the coin would showcase imagery similar to that captured of Trump after the assassination attempt against him last year.A Treasury spokesperson told CNBC in October that a final design for a $1 coin had not yet be chosen. As of Thursday, the Mint's list of contenders included three designs for the \"heads\" side all featuring Trump.",

    "body": "State Senators listen to testimony at the Indiana Statehouse in Indianapolis, Indiana, US, on Monday, Dec. 8, 2025. Kaiti Sullivan | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesThe Indiana Senate on Thursday overwhelmingly voted down a bill to redraw the state's congressional districts to favor Republicans, in a major blow to President Donald Trump.The bill failed in a 19-31 vote, with most Republicans joining Democrats to oppose the measure that Trump had aggressively lobbied for. The GOP has a 40-vote majority in the 50-member Senate.Republicans were expected to gain two additional seats in the U.S. House of Representatives if the redistricting bill had been approved by the Senate. The state's House of Representatives voted in favor of the bill last Friday.Trump had threatened the state's Republican lawmakers with primary challenges if they did not support the bill.His failure to convince them is a rare loss in his effort to redraw congressional maps in red states.Trump had successfully pushed partisan gerrymanders in Texas, North Carolina, Missouri and Utah, as the GOP tries to retain it razor-thin majority in the U.S. House in the 2026 midterm elections. Republicans hold 220 seats in that chamber, with Democrats holding 213 seats.Redistrictings are normally done after a new U.S. Census. The last census was done in 2020.The president and his top aides had launched a pressure campaign to pass the new Indiana district map, which included visits from Vice President JD Vance. In a post on X on Thursday morning, the right-wing group Heritage Action said, \"President Trump has made it clear to Indiana leaders: if the Indiana Senate fails to pass the map, all federal funding will be stripped from the state.\"\"Roads will not be paved. Guard bases will close. Major projects will stop,\" the group said in the tweet. \"These are the stakes and every NO vote will be to blame.\"Trump took to social media on Wednesday night to blast Indiana House Speaker Rod Bray for opposing redistricting. \"He is putting every ounce of his limited strength into asking his soon-to-be very vulnerable friends to vote with him,\" Trump wrote on Truth Social. \"By doing so, he is putting the Majority in the House of Representatives, Washington, D.C., at risk and, at the same time, putting anybody in Indiana who votes against this Redistricting, likewise, at risk,\" Trump wrote.Sen. Greg Goode, a Republican and a key swing vote who would not disclose his position on the bill despite immense pressure from the White House, voted against the measure. \"We have to redirect our focus to what really matters, I believe, to Hoosiers,\" Goode said in a speech on the floor before the vote. \"The forces that define this vitriolic political affairs in places outside of Indiana have been gradually and now very blatantly infiltrated the political affairs in Indiana,\" Goode said.He cited instances of misinformation, pressure campaigns and threats of primaries and violence.Goode was swatted earlier this year after Trump accused him of \"not wanting to resdistrict\" in a Truth Social post.Read more CNBC politics coverageTrump officials move to end student loan payment pause for millions of borrowersJudge unseals Ghislaine Maxwell grand jury materials, citing Epstein files actUkraine at 'critical moment' in war as European allies ramp up pressure on RussiaDemocrats establish AI working group as industry bolsters DC presenceEx-Trump lawyer Habba resigns as NJ U.S. attorney after disqualificationTrump announces $12 billion aid package for farmers caught up in trade warTrump says Netflix, WBD deal could be 'problem' as son-in-law backs Paramount bidSupreme Court to hear case on Trump birthright citizenship orderTrump can fire labor, employment board members without cause: Appeals courtTrump administration views Netflix, Warner Bros. deal with 'heavy skepticism'Costco adds Biden Commerce Sec.

States across the country have pushed redistricting for partisan advantage after the Supreme Court barred maps drawn for partisan advantage to be challenged. \"If we fail to secure a governing majority in the House that supports this agenda, we risk handing the keys back to the very people who destabilized the world in the first place,\" said Sen. Chris Garten, a Republican who supported the gerrymander. Trump's brazen push for gerrymanders that benefit Republicans has kicked off a nationwide war between states controlled by Republicans and Democrats. The maps that create each state's congressional districts are typically only drawn once every 10 years by state legislators after a census.  Republican-controlled Texas adopted a map in August to net the Republicans five additional seats. Democrat-controlled California then responded, adopting a new map in a November referendum that would net Democrats five additional seats.  Florida, Maryland and Virginia have pending redistricting measures. ",

AIS, or automatic identification system, data, provides real-time information about a ship's location and includes the vessel's name, course, speed, classification, call sign and registration number, according to the U.S. Coast Guard's website.During the time that the Skipper's real location was hidden on the AIS network, there were multiple ship-to-ship transfers of cargo, according to Kpler data.The Skipper displayed \"a clear pattern of deceptive operations that went far beyond what its AIS transmissions claimed,\" said Dimitris Ampatzidis, Kpler's manager for risk and compliance.A satellite image shows the very large crude carrier (VLCC) Skipper, which British maritime risk management group Vanguard said was believed to have been seized on December 10, as well as another vessel, off Port Jose, Venezuela, November 18, 2025.Planet Labs | ReutersIn 2024, three AIS spoofings by the Skipper were recorded in Egypt, Iran, the Mediterranean Sea, Ghana and Nigeria, according to Kpler.\"Falisified positions were broadcast, particularly through extended AIS spoofing episodes,\" said Ampatzidis. \"The Skipper engaged in activities entirely inconsistent with its declared voyage, including sanctioned loadings in Iran and Venezuela.\"These behaviours form a coherent picture: a vessel intentionally engineered to operate outside transparency, using digital manipulation and covert logistics to mask sanctioned crude flows under the appearance of normal maritime traffic,\"  Ampatzidis said.Port call data from 2025 shows that Skipper transported oil out of the ports of Jose in Venezuela and Kharg Island in Iran, according to Kpler data.

And in 2023, Skipper visited the Port of Jose in Venezuela.The Skipper is owned by Marshall Islands-based Triton Navigation Corp., and the beneficial cargo owner, vessel manager and operator is Nigeria-based Thomarose Global Ventures Ltd., according to Kpler data.Triton Navigation has been on the OFAC sanctions list since November 2022.\"I believe that the purpose of seizing a sanctioned oil tanker is to make oil buyers and tanker owners operating in the shadow fleet wary of loading Venezuelan crude oil,  reducing the Maduro government's revenues and ultimately hastening his exit,\" said Andrew Lipow, president of Lipow Oil Associates. \"With oil prices hovering below $60 per barrel, it would appear the administration is not too worried about losing Venezuelan oil supplies to the market; there is plenty of oil around,\" Lipow said.\"On the other hand, China would be unhappy losing access to deeply discounted oil supplies.\"The seizure came as President Donald Trump has ramped up pressure on Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro. Trump has said that Maduro's \"days are numbered.\"",

    "body": "A Broadcom sign is pictured as the company prepares to launch new optical chip tech to fend off Nvidia in San Jose, California, U.S., September 5, 2025.  Brittany Hosea-small | ReutersBroadcom reported fourth-quarter results that beat expectations for earnings and revenue, and issued a strong forecast for the current quarter, driven by artificial intelligence demand. The stock initially rose in extended trading before declining more than 2%. Here's how the company did, compared with estimates from analysts polled by LSEG:Earnings per share: $1.95 adjusted vs. $1.86 estimatedRevenue: $18.02 billion vs. $17.49 billion estimatedBroadcom said revenue in the fiscal first quarter will be about $19.1 billion, which would represent 28% year-over-year growth, and is higher than the $18.3 billion average analyst estimate, according to LSEG.CEO Hock Tan said in a statement that Broadcom expects AI chip sales this quarter to double from a year earlier to $8.2 billion, both from custom AI chips as well as semiconductors for AI networking. Net income climbed 97% to $8.51 billion, or $1.74 per share, from $4.32 billion, or 90 cents per share, in the year-ago period. Along with Nvidia, Broadcom has been the other major winner among U.S. semiconductor companies due to the AI boom. The company's stock price is up 75% so far in 2025, after doubling last year, as its custom chips, such as Google's tensor processing units, are gaining increasing traction in the market as a rival to Nvidia's graphics processing units.On an earnings call with analysts, the company said it had acquired a fifth customer for its custom chips, and revealed that Anthropic was the previously unnamed customer which had placed a $10 billion order for Google's TPUs during the quarter. In June, Broadcom said it had three customers and four prospects for its custom AI chips. In September, it said it had a fourth mystery customer who had placed a $10 billion order for custom chips, and separately, announced a partnership with OpenAI in October to develop custom chips. Investors are closely watching to see Broadcom confirm that those companies are continuing to engage and are on-track to buy and deploy custom chips. Anthropic is using the latest Google TPU called Ironwood, Tan said on a earnings call with analysts.Tan said that Broadcom's other customers \"prefer to control their own destiny by continuing to drive their multiyear journey to create their own custom AI accelerators, or XPUs, as we call them.\"He said that Broadcom had added a 5th customer for custom chips, which had placed a $1 billion order expected to be delivered in late 2026. Broadcom has a $73 billion backlog for custom chips, switches, and other data center parts for AI over the next 18 months, Tan said. Broadcom's overall revenue grew 28% during the quarter, which the company attributed largely to a 74% increase in AI chip sales, which would be equivalent to $8.2 billion in AI revenue during the fourth quarter.AI chip sales are reported in the company's semiconductor solutions business, which reported $11.07 billion in sales, up 22% on an annual basis, and topping StreetAccount's $10.77 billion estimate. Broadcom's other major segment, infrastructure software, reported 26% growth to $6.94 billion in sales, topping Wall Street's expectations. The segment includes sales from the company's VMWare offerings. Broadcom said that it would issue a per-share dividend of 65 cents, payable later this month, up from 59 cents.

    "body": "Lindsey Halligan, outside of the White House, Aug. 20, 2025, in Washington.Jacquelyn Martin | APPresident Donald Trump is pressing to get Lindsey Halligan confirmed as U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, weeks after criminal cases against his foes James Comey and Letitia James were dismissed because of Halligan's involvement in their prosecutions.But her nomination faces a likely fatal obstacle from the tradition of so-called blue slips, which Republican senators refuse to abandon despite Trump's demands. Halligan on Wednesday submitted a 28-page questionnaire to the Senate Judiciary Committee, which is responsible for vetting U.S. attorney picks.  It was the first action on her nomination since Trump formally sent it to the Senate on Sept. 30.The questionnaire was sent more than two weeks after a federal judge disqualified her from serving as interim U.S. attorney for the Eastern District because of the nature of her appointment to that role.\"She's the president's nominee. It is our hope that she is confirmed, and submitting her questionnaire is part of that process,\" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told CNBC.MS NOW first reported that Halligan had submitted her questionnaire.A spokesperson for the Judiciary panel's Republican majority told CNBC in a statement, \"The Committee has not received blue slips\" from Virginia's senators, Tim Kaine and Mark Warner, who are both Democrats.Blue slips — literally forms printed on blue paper — for more than a century have given senators a crucial say over nominees for the judiciary and for U.S. attorneys in their states.\"Nominees without blue slips don't have the votes to advance out of committee or get confirmed on the Senate floor,\" the Judiciary spokesperson said.Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, has called the practice \"a fundamental example of our system of checks and balances\" that \"prevents one party from jamming through nominees who don't align with the values in the communities they would serve.\"The Judiciary spokesperson said that Grassley \"wants President Trump's nominees to be successful.\"Halligan had no prior prosecutorial experience when Trump tapped her to lead the U.S. Attorney's Office.Instead, her legal career largely focused on insurance cases.She previously worked as a lawyer for Trump on a federal criminal case in Florida, where he was accused of illegally retaining classified documents, and on Trump's defamation case against CNN.Trump has repeatedly urged Republicans to abandon the blue slips rule, arguing that it undermines his ability to confirm his preferred candidates for key roles.On Thursday morning, the president complained that the practice is \"making it impossible to get great Republican Judges and U.S. Attorneys approved to serve in any state where there is even a single Democrat Senator.\"\"If they say no, then it is OVER for that very well qualified Republican candidate,\" Trump wrote on Truth Social. His post called out Grassley by name for allowing the \"scam\" to continue. Trump also urged Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., \"to get something done, ideally the termination of Blue Slips.\"Read more CNBC politics coverageTrump officials move to end student loan payment pause for millions of borrowersJudge unseals Ghislaine Maxwell grand jury materials, citing Epstein files actUkraine at 'critical moment' in war as European allies ramp up pressure on RussiaDemocrats establish AI working group as industry bolsters DC presenceEx-Trump lawyer Habba resigns as NJ U.S. attorney after disqualificationTrump announces $12 billion aid package for farmers caught up in trade warTrump says Netflix, WBD deal could be 'problem' as son-in-law backs Paramount bidSupreme Court to hear case on Trump birthright citizenship orderTrump can fire labor, employment board members without cause: Appeals courtTrump administration views Netflix, Warner Bros. deal with 'heavy skepticism'Costco adds Biden Commerce Sec.

    "body": "U.S. President Donald Trump looks on, as he signs an executive order on AI in the Oval Office at the White House in Washington, D.C., U.S. Dec. 11, 2025.Al Drago | ReutersPresident Donald Trump signed an executive order Thursday issuing a single regulation framework for artificial intelligence, undermining the power of individual states. \"To win, United States AI companies must be free to innovate without cumbersome regulation,\" the order says. \"But excessive State regulation thwarts this imperative.\"The Trump administration, with the aid of AI and crypto czar David Sacks, has been pursuing a path that would allow federal rules to preempt state regulations on AI, a move meant to keep big Democratic-led states like California and New York from exerting their control over the growing industry. Sacks and fellow tech investor and podcaster Chamath Palihapitiya stood beside Trump during the signing in the Oval Office. He was also joined by Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick.The move marks a win for tech companies like OpenAI and Google and venture firm Andreessen Horowitz that have lobbied to limit regulations they view as overly burdensome. AI companies have been opening offices close to the Capitol and launching campaigns through a super PAC with at least $100 million to spend on the midterm elections in 2026. Proponents of a federal rule have argued that different regulations across the country would hinder the U.S. in its effort to compete in the global AI race. A draft version of a proposed executive order surfaced last month, for a single federal standard on AI \"instead of a patchwork of 50 State Regulatory Regimes.\"A proposed 10-year ban on states regulating AI was initially included in the Republican spending bill but was cut out before Trump signed it in July.Trump's executive order also calls for the attorney general to establish an AI Litigation Task Force, \"whose sole responsibility shall be to challenge State AI laws.\"States that don't adhere to the rules could face funding restrictions. The order says that within 90 days of its signing, the secretary of commerce must specify the conditions under which states may be eligible to receive remaining funding under the Broadband Equity Access and Deployment, or BEAD, program, a $42.5 billion effort to expand high-speed access in rural areas.

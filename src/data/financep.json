    "body": "The administration of President Donald Trump is taking aim at state laws that ban the inclusion of medical debt on consumers' credit reports.In late October, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau released what's known as an interpretive rule, stating that laws prohibiting medical debt reporting in 15 states are preempted by the Fair Credit Reporting Act.Though the move is not legally binding, it marks an abrupt about-face from CFPB guidance during former President Joe Biden's administration, which allowed states to make their own credit rules as long as they weren't \"inconsistent\" with the federal law. A state requiring each credit agency to provide consumers with two free credit reports per year, for instance, would not be at odds with the FCRA, which requires one.Consumer credit advocates are sounding the alarm. Millions of Americans are already facing the possibility of rising health-care premiums, a reality that could force more people into medical debt, says Chi Chi Wu, a senior attorney at the National Consumer Law Center.Should medical debt protections fall, \"now we're going to make it even worse by ruining your credit record,\" Wu says. \"It's just insult to injury. It's rubbing salt in the wound.\"What's at stakeMedical debt is a major source of financial insecurity among U.S. consumers. Americans owed about $220 billion in medical debt, according to a 2024 analysis from the Kaiser Family Foundation, with around 14 million people owing a debt of more than $1,000 and 3 million people owing more than $10,000.The three major credit bureaus stopped reporting medical debts below $500 in April 2023. For the 15 states that have taken things a step further by banning any medical debt on credit reports, the rationale is simple, say Wu: Adding the data to credit reports is unnecessarily punitive.The CFPB declined to comment on the reasoning behind the guidance. But the previous iteration of the agency spelled out why it says medical debt reporting hurts consumers.\"People who get sick shouldn't have their financial future upended,\" former CFPB Director Rohit Chopra said earlier this year. Reporting the debt, he continued, \"has allowed debt collectors to abuse the credit reporting system to coerce people into paying medical bills they may not even owe.\"Essentially, allowing medical debt to appear on credit reports — whose related scores determine whether consumers can access credit or buy a home — puts the burden on consumers to navigate debt that is often sudden and difficult to understand.For proponents of including medical debt on credit reports, \"the argument is that the credit report is more accurate because there's more information, and you don't want to lend to someone who has a lot of medical debt,\" Wu says.But an April 2025 study from the National Bureau of Economic Research found that removing medical data from credit reports was \"unlikely to affect credit outcomes.\" That's generally because people who have high levels of medical debt often rack up other kinds of debt to pay for treatment, Wu says.\"If you really are financially struggling from your medical debts, if you started off with an even halfway decent credit score, the first thing that happens is your credit card balances run up,\" she says.In other words, credit issuers likely have all the information they need to determine your creditworthiness, simply by looking at your credit card usage, which makes up a huge part of your score. Adding medical debt to credit reports amounts to kicking consumers when they're down, says Wu.'It's up to judges, not the CFPB'Though the CFPB's interpretive rule is perhaps the first step on the administration's part to unravel medical debt reporting bans, the guidance itself isn't legally binding. Rather, those laws would have to be challenged in court, says Brad Lipton, a former general counsel for the CFPB whose name appears on the Biden-era guidance.\"It's ultimately up to judges, not the CFPB,\" he says. The recent guidance, just like the one it contradicts, are merely pieces of evidence for a judge to consider.In the meantime, the state bans \"haven't been super controversial,\" he says. The reason, he says, is that credit reporting of medical debt is not a big driver of payment of medical bills.\"If someone doesn't pay their medical debt, it's usually because they simply don't have the money,\" he says. \"The government and the system can torture them all they want, but you're just not going to get much money out of it. It's water from a stone.\"Want to level up your AI skills? Sign up for Smarter by CNBC Make It's new online course, How To Use AI To Communicate Better At Work.

    "body": "A recent string of high-profile layoffs have taken up headlines and caused anxiety in the workforce.Companies announced 153,074 layoffs in October, adding up to 1.1 million cut announcements for the year, according to outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas. That makes it the worst year for layoff notices since 2009, CNBC reported.But job experts say they're not in panic mode. Layoff news doesn't paint the whole picture of the job market. Private data around job openings, payrolls and employee sentiment show that hiring is cooling but \"not falling off a cliff,\" says Glassdoor chief economist Daniel Zhao.The Challenger monthly data can be volatile, for one, and layoff announcements haven't yet shown up in state-level weekly filings for unemployment benefits, which are still being released during the shutdown.\"I'm not alarmed,\" says Laura Ullrich, Indeed's director of economic research. The latest available data \"does not seem today to indicate that we're going into a high layoff period for the overall economy.\"Government shutdown and layoffs are hitting worker confidenceWhile economists aren't predicting a recession anytime soon, news of layoffs and the government shutdown is hitting worker confidence.The share of Glassdoor reviews mentioning layoffs is up 22% year-over-year as of October, according to data from the jobs site. Workers' confidence in the job market is down from a small rise in September and is close to a recent record-low set in June, according to Glassdoor data.Senior-level employees saw the biggest drops in confidence over the last year, dropping 4.6 percentage points since October 2024.That's concerning since leadership confidence spreads to other employees through hiring and investment plans. If senior leaders aren't confident their business is doing well, they could decide to reduce hiring or lay people off, Zhao says.Meanwhile, for those on the market, fewer people say they've gotten a job offer and declined it, signaling they have less leverage and might be settling for jobs rather than holding out for better ones, according to Glassdoor data.Health-care openings are making up for losses elsewhereMany workers are additionally competing for a smaller pool of opportunities. As of Oct. 31, job postings on Indeed are at their lowest level since 2021, continuing a declining trend for the last four years.Job postings are lowest in areas hit by the government shutdown, including Washington, D.C., and recent tech layoffs, like California and Washington.Openings are concentrated in health-care sectors, security and safety, and engineering, which on the whole are keeping the job market stable.\"I see it a tale of two economies,\" Ullrich says. \"There are certain fields where jobs are continuing to be added, and there's others that are shedding jobs.\"Health care and private education jobs have propped up the labor economy for some time: They make up about 17% of the jobs nationally but have accounted for 56% of job growth between July 2023 and July 2025.\"If health-care employment started dipping that would ring alarm bells for me,\" Ullrich says.The bigger picture: 'The job market is in a funk'Economists say available datasets can provide a pretty good picture of the job market, but official data from the Labor Department around hiring and unemployment are necessary for a best look at the health of the labor economy.The unemployment rate remained steady 4.3% in August, the last month of available government data.The Bureau of Labor Statistics missed another jobs report Friday due to the government shutdown. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones expect it would have shown a drop in 60,000 jobs and a rising unemployment rate to 4.5%, CNBC reported.The numbers we do have point overall to a continuously slowing job market. Economic uncertainty is weighing on employers' willingness to hire, Zhao says, meaning job-seekers are frozen out of the market and employed workers have less leverage to progress in their careers, win raises and stay engaged in the workplace.Hiring experts say building your network and asking for referrals are the best ways to get a job right now. To stand out in a competitive market, consider sharpening your resume to be outcomes-based, building your personal brand on LinkedIn and doing mock interviews, GrowthLoop senior recruiter Kathleen Nolan previously told CNBC Make It.\"Overall, I would say that the job market is in a funk right now,\" Zhao says. \"Even if unemployment is even [and] some of the top line indicators still point to a job market that is not historically bad, that doesn't necessarily mean that people are happy with where the job market is today.\"Want to level up your AI skills? Sign up for Smarter by CNBC Make It's new online course, How To Use AI To Communicate Better At Work.

    "body": "\"Neighbors need food NOW,\" the homepage of Second Harvest Food Bank of South Louisiana reads.Amid uncertainty around SNAP funding, food banks across the U.S. are scrambling to pick up the slack for the 42 million Americans who rely on the program for food assistance.SNAP payments have been paused since Nov. 1 due to the government shutdown. On Thursday, a federal judge ordered the Trump administration to restore full funding for the program by Nov. 7. The administration quickly appealed the ruling and on Friday sought an emergency block on the order.While the larger legal battle continues, several states have said that they've started to process full food stamp payments, the New York Times reports.CNBC Make It spoke with leaders at several food banks about how they're responding to the challenges caused by SNAP cuts and the government shutdown.Brian Greene, the president and CEO of Houston Food Bank, describes the situation as \"a rolling disaster.\"SNAP payments are typically distributed on a staggered monthly schedule in Texas, Greene says, which means that each day since the beginning of November, another 125,000 Texans run out of EBT funds.As the shutdown drags on, a growing number of furloughed federal workers in Houston are turning to food banks for assistance, Greene says.\"Every day that this keeps going, the damage gets worse and worse,\" he says.Facing 'a great increase in need'According to Leslie Bacho, CEO of Second Harvest of Silicon Valley, the effects of the SNAP disruption are already becoming clear.Within its service area of Santa Clara and San Mateo counties, more than 168,000 people rely on CalFresh, the state of California's version of SNAP, Bacho says.On Monday alone, over 1,500 unique users visited the bank's online food locator tool, which connects people to nearby food distribution sites, according to Bacho. That's nearly double the usual volume.Their hotline has also experienced a 200% increase in requests for referrals, she says.\"We're in the process of ordering additional food and really trying to ramp up for what we think will be a great increase in need,\" Bacho says.Jon Toups, the CEO of Second Harvest Food Bank of South Louisiana, says his organization was \"stretched thin\" even before the SNAP delays.The Louisiana legislature has stepped in to help provide reserve funds for SNAP users, he says, but USDA cuts earlier this year had already caused supply shortages for food banks.There's \"no question\" that there's been an uptick in demand for food assistance in the past week, Toups says, and \"we're seeing an awful lot of anxiousness.\"For every meal that food banks provide, SNAP provides nine, Toups says, creating an even larger chasm of need for banks to fill.\"The shutdown is putting an additional strain on the food bank network when we can least afford it,\" he says.How food banks are respondingAbout 425,000 Houston households rely on SNAP, Greene says, and in order to meet their typical level of need, Houston Food Bank would have to double its output.They're currently using all available resources — Greene gave the bank's procurement team the go-ahead to \"spend what [they] need to spend\" — in an effort to increase output by about 50%.Right now, Houston Food Bank is in \"disaster response mode,\" Greene says.They've set up special distribution sites specifically targeting federal employees and SNAP users in parking lots across the city, including at Houston's NRG Stadium.Houston residents line up in their cars for a special free food distribution by the Houston Food Bank at the NRG Stadium in Houston, Texas, on Nov. 1, 2025.Mark Felix | AFP | Getty ImagesIt costs around $15,000 to set up one of these \"supersites,\" according to Greene, and they're \"pulling in more volunteers and paying a lot of extra expenses,\" he says.At Second Harvest Food Bank South Louisiana, Toups requested to use a \"pretty significant\" amount of the bank's reserve funds to purchase more food, he says.He's also working to spread the word about the food bank's situation.\"Our community has really stepped up. We've seen an uptick in donations, not only financially speaking, but with their time, which is a huge piece for us,\" he says.Still, staff are \"overrun right now,\" he says: \"I almost feel like I'm asking them to work 24/7 right now to stay out in front of this.\"\"We will always do the best we can do,\" Toups says, but their current situation \"is not sustainable.\"Second Harvest Silicon Valley is in \"drop everything mode\" working to allocate 15% more food to each of their distribution sites, Bacho says.Crucially, while the charitable food system is already \"very, very strained,\" the last thing Bacho wants is for people in need to worry that banks will run out of food.\"Whether that involves going into our reserves, whether it involves raising more from our community or from our greater partnerships with our counties, we're going to do everything we can to meet that increase in need,\" she says.Still 'just at the beginning' of crisisBoth Toups and Greene liken the current situation to the aftermath of a natural disaster — but in those situations, \"the federal government was there to help,\" Greene says.\"In this case, the federal government is the cause, not the solution,\" he says.Right now, local giving is keeping many food banks and aid organizations afloat, according to Greene.\"If philanthropy holds up, we can keep doing this for quite some time,\" he says, but \"in a crisis, philanthropy shoots up, but it comes right back down.\"There are a few ways that people can support food banks right now, according to Toups.Primarily, food banks need monetary donations. That's the \"most efficient\" way to help, he says, \"because it allows me to actually use that money to go do exactly what's needed at that moment in time.\"Volunteers can also help food banks with tasks like sorting donations, packing boxes and distributing food, he says.At the end of the day, though, \"we've got to get back to some level of normalcy,\" Toups says.Right now, \"we're just at the beginning of this crisis,\" according to Bacho. As more days pass without SNAP funding, the demands on food banks will only increase, she says.\"We need this man-made problem in Washington, D.C. to resolve itself,\" Toups says.Want to level up your AI skills? Sign up for Smarter by CNBC Make It's new online course, How To Use AI To Communicate Better At Work.

He is very passionate about shareholder rights and good corporate governance and will go to extreme lengths to fight incompetent boards and over compensated managers. Icahn has invested across all sectors over his more than six-decade long career and has a long history in the automotive parts and services industry. He has been involved in several mergers and acquisitions in this space, acquiring some of his portfolio companies through Icahn Automotive, the automotive-segment business of his conglomerate, Icahn Enterprises. This includes his acquisition of Pep Boys-Manny Moe and Jack in 2016 and Federal Mogul in 2017.What's happeningOn Nov. 5, Carl Icahn filed a 13D with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, disclosing a 14.79% position in Monro.Behind the scenesMonro is engaged in the provision of automotive undercar repair and tire services in the United States, operating more than 1,100 repair shops and tire dealers in 32 states under multiple regional brands. The company has faced several challenges in recent years. Macro factors like lower consumer demand, higher material and labor costs, and a trend in consumer trade-down to lower margin tire products have applied significant margin and growth pressure. As a result, following a 4.9% decrease in sales for fiscal year 2025 — the second year in a row with a meaningful decline in revenue — the company announced that they are closing approximately 145 underperforming locations. Most recently, the company's third-quarter earnings report left a lot of investors disappointed about its strategic transition, with weaker-than-expected revenue and no specific financial guidance for the upcoming fiscal year. Shares fell 16.7% the next day. Lastly, many investors have questioned the company's dividend payout ratio, which has remained relatively large despite these ongoing struggles. Putting all this together, it comes as little surprise that shares have underperformed, down 44.73%, 66.73% and 63.25% over the past 1-, 3- and 5-year periods, respectively, prior to Icahn's announcement.Perhaps this depressed valuation is what caught the eye of Carl Icahn. He disclosed a 14.79% position in the company (67% of which was acquired since the stock's Oct. 29 downturn), immediately sending the stock up over 15%. While there are plenty of cheap stocks, this isn't Icahn taking a flyer on the automotive industry. Icahn has a rich history in the automotive parts and services industry, most notably Icahn Automotive, the automotive segment of his conglomerate, Icahn Enterprises. Icahn knows this industry well and likely sees Monro as a great business that is significantly undervalued. The timing of this public engagement is also very notable. It is not just the stock's recent fall that makes this a good entry point for an investor like Icahn. Monro recently agreed to collapse its dual class share structure, which had previously granted its sole Class C shareholder, Peter Solomon, veto power over any matter brought to a shareholder vote, effectively making this a controlled company. Pursuant to its approval in 2023, this collapse will occur prior to the 2026 annual meeting, which is expected to take place next August. So, what does this mean for the company's shareholders? It effectively sets the stage for the company being converted from a privately run company to a publicly run company for the benefit of its shareholders. With one person having veto power over all material board decisions, the rest of the board becomes somewhat irrelevant. With this conversion, the company has an opportunity to have a real, collaborative, and productive board. This would require its reconstitution, and we know of nobody better or more experienced than Icahn for that endeavor.Solomon is an 87-year-old renowned investment banker and Icahn is, well, Icahn and a contemporary of Solomon. However, there is no evidence that the two have ever crossed paths. Despite this, we would imagine that they have many relationships in common and mutual respect for each other. While there are many different ways this campaign can go down, what we would like to see is the two elder statesmen meeting in a room with an air of civility and cordiality uncommon in the average activist engagement and together coming up with a board that will oversee management, hold them accountable on behalf of shareholders and usher the company through its first real phase as a truly public company. With Solomon already agreeing to give up control, and neither Solomon nor Icahn likely to be on the continuing board, there is no reason why this should get contentious.However, we also must address the elephant in the room. Icahn has built his automotive industry on acquisitions, and Monro appears to fit in very nicely in IEP's automotive business. Icahn has launched activist campaigns at some of the auto companies that he later went on to acquire, including Pep Boys-Manny Moe and Jack in 2016 and Federal Mogul in 2017. When Icahn acquired Pep Boys he also stated: \"We believe that with our abundant resources and knowledge of the industry we will be able to grow this business and take advantage of consolidation opportunities, thereby benefiting customers, manufacturing partners and employees, as well as our shareholders.\" While we sincerely believe that Icahn's main motivation for this investment is to invest in a good company that he believes is at an inflection point and is significantly undervalued, there is always the chance that he might want to own the entire company one day. This is a very small position for him and a good return would not move the needle as much as a synergistic integration into his automative business, but we see no reason why both things cannot be true.Ken Squire is the founder and president of 13D Monitor, an institutional research service on shareholder activism, and the founder and portfolio manager of the 13D Activist Fund, a mutual fund that invests in a portfolio of activist investments.",

    "body": "A Peloton stationary bicycle inside a store in Palo Alto, California, US, on Monday, Aug. 5, 2024. David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesPeloton on Thursday posted its second profitable quarter in a row as it released strong guidance for the crucial holiday shopping season, banking on its relaunched product assortment to drive growth. The connected fitness company posted a surprise net income of $13.9 million in the three months ended Sept. 30, compared with a loss of $900,000 a year earlier. For the current quarter, Peloton's strongest for hardware sales, the company is expecting revenue to be between $665 million and $685 million, a slight increase from the year-ago period and largely better than Wall Street expectations of $665 million, according to LSEG. Peloton also raised its full-year adjusted EBITDA outlook and is now expecting it to be between $425 million and $475 million, up $25 million from its previous outlook on both ends. Much of that forecast is ahead of analyst expectations of between $400 million and $450 million, according to StreetAccount. Shares jumped about 11% in extended trading Thursday.Despite the good news, Peloton is still dealing with issues from its past. Earlier on Thursday, it said it was initiating yet another recall from its early product lineup. The Consumer Product Safety Commission said the company was recalling 833,000 of its original Bike+ devices after receiving reports that the seat post can break and detach during a ride – the same issue that prompted a recall of its base Bike model in 2023. \"We have received a small number of reports of an original series Bike+ seat post breaking during use. As of today, we are aware of three such incidents,\" Peloton CEO Peter Stern said on the company's earnings call Thursday.Peloton's latest recall cost the company $13.5 million during the quarter reported Thursday, contributing to a 0.3 percentage point decline in its gross margin.For its first fiscal 2026 quarter reported Thursday, Peloton beat analyst expectations on the top and bottom lines. Here's how the fitness company did in its first fiscal quarter compared with what Wall Street was anticipating, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:Earnings per share: 3 cents vs. 0 cents expectedRevenue: $551 million vs. $540 million expectedSales dropped to $551 million, down about 6% from $586 million a year earlier. Under the direction of Stern, who took the helm in January, the connected fitness company has been finalizing its cost cuts and turning its attention back to growth now that it's back to regularly generating free cash flow and operating profitably. \"Our intent is to go well beyond [cardio connected fitness]... we've got strength, we've got mental, mental wellbeing, nutrition and hydration and sleep and recovery,\" Stern said. \"We are focused on growth, but the growth needs to be profitable … both in top line growth as well as increased margins associated with that business as well.\"Last month, Peloton relaunched its product assortment, introduced a commercial equipment line and raised prices for both subscriptions and hardware ahead of the holiday shopping season. The revamped assortment, touching its bike, rowing machine and treadmill products, features an AI-powered tracking camera, speakers, a 360-degree swivel screen and hands-free control, among other new features. \"Our launch of an entirely new product lineup with the cross training series, is a great reason for us to talk to our members and nonmembers alike,\" Stern said.Peloton is betting consumers will be willing to spend big on the products for flashy holiday gifts, either for themselves or a loved one. But just over a month into the launch, it remains unclear how they're performing. The company's first fiscal quarter ended the day before the new products were launched. Across the retail industry, the personal electronics category has been under pressure. While Peloton operates in a category of its own, shoppers have been pulling back on other big-ticket items and being more careful about where their dollars are going in an unsteady economic environment. After Peloton's last recall, the company said at the time that it saw higher-than-expected membership churn and costs as a result.– CNBC's Luke Fountain contributed to this report",

    "body": "US President Donald Trump makes an announcement in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington, DC on Nov. 6, 2025. Andrew Caballero-Reynolds | AFP | Getty ImagesPresident Donald Trump on Thursday struck landmark deals with Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk that could mark a turning point in how many people can access their costly blockbuster obesity drugs. Under the agreements, Medicare will start covering GLP-1s for obesity for certain patients for the first time beginning in mid-2026 – a shift that will open access to millions of older adults and could spur more employers and other private insurers to follow suit, some experts said. Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly are also lowering the prices that all state Medicaid programs will pay for GLP-1s, but it's up to states to opt into coverage. Obesity drug coverage among state Medicaid plans, employers and other private insurers remains spotty due to the $1,000 or more monthly list prices of existing GLP-1s, including Eli Lilly's obesity injection Zepbound and Novo Nordisk's competitor Wegovy. The limited insurance coverage has blocked out patients who can't afford their hefty price tags. That lack of access has led to mounting pressure on health plans and the government to expand coverage — and the government agreements with drugmakers could mark a major shift.\"I think it'll start with the government, start with Medicare, and the insurers will quickly follow,\" Nick Fabrizio, an associate teaching professor in Cornell's health policy program, told CNBC. \"I do think that's coming.\"\"This is a great step towards trying to address a chronic and serious issue, and for those patients who may feel like they have no hope,\" he said.Roughly 8 to 9 million people in the U.S. are using GLP-1s, Eli Lilly CEO David Ricks said at a briefing with reporters on Thursday. The added Medicare coverage under the deal could bring in as many as 40 million new eligible patients, and prompt more commercial plans to cover the medicines, he said.The deals could also address the inability of many patients with limited or no insurance coverage for obesity drugs to access them, by offering the treatments at a discount on the Trump administration's direct-to-consumer website, TrumpRx.gov. The monthly out-of-pocket cost of existing injections and upcoming pills could range from $50 to $350 starting next year, depending on the dosage and insurance coverage a patient has. Still, there is a law prohibiting Medicare from covering weight loss drugs, so any changes would have to come from Congress. Eli Lilly's Ricks told reporters Thursday that for now, the government will launch an initial pilot program in the spring of 2026 under a temporary legal mechanism. It would be voluntary for Medicare prescription drug plans, so \"it may be possible that a few plans do not participate, but I would expect almost all do,\" he said. But Ricks said that it will transition into a formal so-called Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation pilot program in 2027, which means it will be mandatory for all Medicare Part D plans.\"So we expect broad coverage in all plans both in 2026 and beyond,\" he said.Medicare coverage could be a sea changeLikely the most notable feature of the deals is Medicare coverage of obesity drugs, as it will allow the treatments to reach new patients in the program and could lead to broader private insurance coverage. Under the deals, Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk agreed to cut the price Medicare and Medicaid pay for GLP-1s to $245 per month. In Medicare specifically, certain patients will pay a copay of $50 per month for all approved uses of injectable and oral GLP-1 drugs, including diabetes and obesity treatment.But the Trump administration is putting some constraints on which Medicare beneficiaries will be eligible to receive GLP-1s for obesity and cardiovascular and metabolic benefits. People who qualify include patients with a body mass index of 27 or above with prediabetes or established cardiovascular disease; people with a BMI of 30 or more with related health conditions; or those with severe obesity, or a BMI of 35 and above. GLP-1s for weight loss are approved for a broader population: people who have obesity or are overweight with one related condition. In a note Thursday, Leerink Partners analyst David Risinger also said it's unclear whether the government will allow patients to stay on a GLP-1 for obesity after their BMI levels drop. Even with those restrictions, \"I think in practice, it's still going to cover a fair number of people,\" said Darius Lakdawalla, chief scientific officer at the University of Southern California's Schaeffer Center.JPMorgan analyst Chris Schott said the eligibility criteria mean 80% of the obese population in Medicare could receive coverage for GLP-1s, despite the limits.\"Today's deal will open up meaningful access to obesity drugs,\" Schott said in a note about Eli Lilly on Thursday. Lakdawalla added that while there isn't clear evidence that private insurers will expand coverage on the heels of government plans, \"it's just optically harder for them to continue to constrain coverage when Medicare and Medicaid are covering them.\" \"That's going to exert some pressure for commercial coverage of these drugs to expand as well,\" Lakdawalla said. Coverage for GLP-1s for obesity has ticked up slightly, but remains sparse: A May survey of more than 300 companies by the International Foundation of Employee Benefit Plans found that 36% provided coverage for GLP-1s for both weight loss and diabetes, up from 34% in 2024. Medicaid, direct-to-consumer offerings could fill gapsLakdawalla said the direct-to-consumer offerings under the deal could be useful for people who are underinsured, uninsured or may not have coverage for obesity medicines. Still, it's unclear how many more patients the drugs will reach due to the offerings. Both Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk have introduced lower cost options for their drugs for people paying in cash and purchasing the drugs directly through their websites. But the deals with Trump will give those patients even bigger discounts.On TrumpRx, the average monthly cost for Wegovy, Zepbound and other injectable GLP-1s will start at $350 and drop to $250 within the next two years, according to senior Trump administration officials. Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk both offered some GLP-1s on their direct-to-consumer platforms for up to $450 to $500 per month.Starting doses of obesity pills from Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk — expected to hit the market next year — will be $149 per month on TrumpRx, Medicare and Medicaid.  Eli Lilly on Thursday said it would lower prices by $50 on its own direct-to-consumer platform, LillyDirect, which already offers Zepbound and other drugs at a discount to cash-paying patients. The multidose pen of Zepbound will be available for $299 per month at the lowest dose, with additional doses being priced up to $449 per month.In terms of Medicaid, Cornell's Fabrizio said states will likely want to start covering obesity drugs at the lower price point, \"but the question is how will they pay for it?\"Around a dozen state Medicaid programs cover obesity drugs, according to 2024 estimates from KFF, a health policy research organization. While GLP-1s offer substantial health benefits to Medicaid beneficiaries, state programs are already facing constrained budgets and administrative demands.Fabrizio added that raising taxes to cover the drugs \"could be a sticky issue.\"Still, JPMorgan's Schott said offering lower prices to Medicaid programs could lead to a \"significant increase in coverage\" in that channel, where Zepbound has very limited uptake. ",

    "body": "The Ford Lightning is seen at the New York International Auto Show on April 16, 2025.Danielle DeVries | CNBCDETROIT — Ford Motor is reportedly considering ending production of its all-electric F-150 Lightning pickup truck amid mounting losses and more challenging market conditions for EVs.The Wall Street Journal first reported the talks Thursday, adding they are ongoing and nothing has been finalized. A source familiar with Ford's product strategy who spoke anonymously because the talks were private confirmed to CNBC that the automaker has been evaluating its future EVs amid the company's losses and changing market conditions.\"What I can say is that F-150 Lightning is the best-selling electric pickup truck in the U.S. — despite new competition from CyberTruck, Chevy, GMC, Hummer and Rivian — and delivered record sales in Q3. Right now, we're focused on producing F-150 ICE and Hybrid as we recover from the fire at Novelis,\" a Ford spokesman said in an emailed statement Thursday, declining to comment on the discussions.Ford previously confirmed it paused production of the Lightning amid supply chain disruptions related to a fire at an aluminum plant for Novelis, a main supplier for the pickup truck.Ford President Kumar Galhotra, when asked last month by media about Lightning production potentially ending, said the company's main priority was gas-powered models. He said F-150 Lightning production could restart whenever the company would like but declined to give a timeframe.The F-150 Lightning, which Ford once said was as important to the company as founder Henry Ford's Model T, never lived up to internal or external expectations. The pickup initially received more than 200,000 nonbinding reservations that failed to convert to sales.F-150 Lightning sales this year through October are roughly level compared with a year earlier at only 24,577 units. Since going on sale in 2022 in the U.S., Ford has sold less than 100,000 F-150 Lightning models.The Lightning is manufactured at a facility connected to a large F-150 production plant in metro Detroit.Ford's EV operations, including the Lightning, have lost the company billions of dollars annually in recent years.The U.S. EV market has faced daunting changes in regulations under the Trump administration this year, including the end of consumer credits of up to $7,500 for the purchase of an EV.The reported discussions at Ford follow crosstown rival Stellantis deciding to end plans to produce an all-electric Ram 1500 pickup as well as General Motors significantly scaling back its plans for electric trucks.",

    "body": "Tesla CEO Elon Musk attends the Saudi-U.S. Investment Forum, in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, May 13, 2025. Hamad I Mohammed | ReutersTesla CEO Elon Musk says the company will likely need to build a \"gigantic\" semiconductor fabrication plant to keep up with its artificial intelligence and robotics ambitions.\"One of the things I'm trying to figure out is — how do we make enough chips?\" Musk said at Tesla's annual shareholders meeting Thursday.Tesla currently relies on contract chipmakers Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company and Samsung Electronics to produce its chip designs. Musk said he was also considering working with U.S. chip company Intel. \"But even when we extrapolate the best-case scenario for chip production from our suppliers, it's still not enough,\" he said.Tesla would probably need to build a \"gigantic\"  chip fab, which Musk described as a \"Tesla terra fab.\" \"I can't see any other way to get to the volume of chips that we're looking for.\" Microchips are the brains that power almost all modern technologies, including everything from consumer electronics like smartphones to massive data centers, and demand for them has been surging amid the AI boom.Tech giants, including Tesla, have been clamoring for more supply from chipmakers like TSMC — the world's largest and most advanced chipmaker. According to Musk, Tesla's potential fab's initial capacity would reach 100,000 wafer starts per month and eventually scale up to 1 million. In the semiconductor industry, wafer starts per month is a measure of how many new chips a fab produces each month.For comparison, TSMC says its annual wafer production capacity reached 17 million in 2024, or around 1.42 million wafer starts per month.While Tesla doesn't yet manufacture its own microchips, the company has been designing custom chips for autonomous driving for several years.It is currently outsourcing production of its latest-generation \"AI5\" chip, which Musk said will be cheaper, power-efficient, and optimized for Tesla's AI software.The CEO also announced on Thursday that Tesla will begin producing its Cybercab — an autonomous electric vehicle with no pedals or steering wheel — in April.Musk's statements underscore Tesla's shift into AI and robotics — industries the CEO sees as the future of the global economy. \"With AI and robotics, you can actually increase the global economy by a factor of 10, or maybe 100. There's not, like, an obvious limit,\" Musk said at the shareholder meeting. ",

    "body": "watch nowFed Governor Stephen Miran on Friday suggested that surging demand for dollar-denominated stablecoins could help push U.S. interest rates lower.In a speech delivered for an audience of economists in New York, the central bank official and appointee of President Donald Trump said the flood of crypto tokens pegged to the dollar could tamp down what economists refer to as \"r-star,\" or the \"neutral\" rate of interest that neither pushes nor impedes growth.If that happens, he said, the Fed might need to lower its own policy rate to avoid unintentionally slowing the economy.\"Stablecoins may become a multitrillion-dollar elephant in the room for central bankers,\" Miran said. \"Stablecoins are already increasing demand for U.S. Treasury bills and other dollar-denominated liquid assets by purchasers outside the United States, and this demand will continue growing.\"Citing prior research, Miran said stablecoin growth could push the Fed's benchmark rate down by 0.4 percentage point.During his short time on the Fed board, Miran has advocated aggressive rate cuts, in part because he thinks the neutral rate is considerably lower than most of his colleagues assume. His latest remarks extend that argument into the world of digital finance, suggesting that the rise of stablecoins could structurally lower borrowing costs for years to come.Previously, his arguments have been focused largely on moderating inflation and the importance of the Fed not impeding economic growth with higher rates. The stablecoin dissertation adds another wrinkle to the case for easier policy.\"Even relatively conservative estimates of stablecoin growth imply an increase in the net supply of loanable funds in the economy that pushes down\" the neutral rate, he said. If neutral is lower, he added, \"policy rates should also be lower than they would otherwise be to support a healthy economy. A failure of the central bank to cut rates in response to a reduction in [r-star] is contractionary.\"Miran is expected to leave the Fed in January, when the unexpired term he is filling runs out.",

    "body": "OpenAI CEO Sam Altman speaks to media following a Q&amp;A at the OpenAI data center in Abilene, Texas, U.S., Sept. 23, 2025.  Shelby Tauber | ReutersOpenAI CEO Sam Altman said Thursday that the artificial intelligence startup is on track to generate more than $20 billion in annualized revenue run rate this year, with plans to grow to hundreds of billions in sales by 2030.The company has inked more than $1.4 trillion of infrastructure deals in recent months to try and build out the data centers it says are needed to meet growing demand. The staggering sum has raised questions from investors and others in the industry about where OpenAI will come up with the money.\"We are trying to build the infrastructure for a future economy powered by AI, and given everything we see on the horizon in our research program, this is the time to invest to be really scaling up our technology,\" Altman wrote in a post on X. \"Massive infrastructure projects take quite awhile to build, so we have to start now.\"OpenAI was founded as a nonprofit research lab in 2015, but has become one of the fastest-growing commercial entities on the planet following the launch of its chatbot ChatGPT in 2022. The startup is currently valued at $500 billion, though it's still not profitable.In September, OpenAI CFO Sarah Friar told CNBC that OpenAI was on track to generate $13 billion in revenue this year.Friar caught the attention of the Trump administration this week after she saying at at event that OpenAI is looking to create an ecosystem of banks, private equity and a federal \"backstop\" or \"guarantee\" that could help the company finance its investments in cutting-edge chips. She clarified those comments late Wednesday, writing in a post on LinkedIn that OpenAI is not seeking a government backstop for its infrastructure commitments.\"I used the word 'backstop' and it muddied the point,\" Friar wrote. \"As the full clip of my answer shows, I was making the point that American strength in technology will come from building real industrial capacity which requires the private sector and government playing their part.\"Venture capitalist David Sacks, who is serving as President Donald Trump's AI and crypto czar, said Thursday that there will be \"no federal bailout for AI.\" He wrote in a post on X that if one frontier model company in the U.S. fails, another will take its place.Altman said Thursday that OpenAI does \"not have or want government guarantees for OpenAI datacenters.\" He said taxpayers should not bail out companies that make poor decisions, and that \"if we get it wrong, that's on us.\"\"This is the bet we are making, and given our vantage point, we feel good about it,\" Altman wrote. \"But we of course could be wrong, and the market—not the government—will deal with it if we are.\"WATCH: Trump AI czar David Sacks says ‘no federal bailout for AI’ after OpenAI CFO’s commentswatch now",

    "body": "MIAMI, FLORIDA - OCTOBER 31: A 'We Accept (Food Stamps)' sign hangs in the window of a grocery store on October 31, 2025 in Miami, Florida. The food stamp program, now known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), may run out of funding on November 1st due to the federal government shutdown, which is now entering its second month. In Miami-Dade County, nearly one in six residents receives food assistance. (Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)Joe Raedle | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesThe Supreme Court on Friday night temporarily paused a federal judge's order that directed the Trump administration to pay full SNAP benefits to 42 million Americans for November by the end of the day.The move came hours after the 1st Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals in Boston denied the administration's emergency request to halt the order relating to food stamp benefits to primarily low-income people.But the appeals court also said it would soon rule on whether the administration was entitled to a stay of the order by U.S. District Court in Rhode Island Judge Jack McConnell while its appeal of the order plays out.Supreme Court Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, in the order on Friday night in favor of the administration, pushed the 1st Circuit to quickly determine whether to issue that stay.\"The applicants assert that, without intervention from this Court, they will have to 'transfer an estimated $4 billion by tonight' to fund SNAP benefits through November,\" Jackson wrote.That money was to come from so-called Section 32 funds that the Trump administration said it did not want to use to augment a partial payment of SNAP benefits that federal officials planned to make. The partial benefits payment would come from $4.6 billion in contingency funds set aside by Congress for that purpose.The administration originally planned not to pay any SNAP benefits in November because of the ongoing government shutdown.\"Given the First Circuit's representations, an administrative stay is required to facilitate the First Circuit's expeditious resolution of the pending stay motion,\" Jackson wrote.She said that the Supreme Court's stay \"will terminate forty-eight hours after the First Circuit's resolution of the pending motion, which the First Circuit is expected to issue with dispatch.\"That two-day window would give time for the Trump administration, or plaintiffs in the case, to return to the Supreme Court to challenge any ruling by the 1st Circuit.It is not clear to what extent Jackson's order will affect payments of SNAP benefits.The U.S. Department of Agriculture earlier Friday told states it would begin disbursing full SNAP benefits to comply with McConnell's order, even as the administration appealed the ruling.The USDA's memo did not suggest that the administration would renege on that plan even if a higher court blocked the order.The Associated Press reported late Friday that more than half a dozen states had \"confirmed that some SNAP recipients already were issued full November payments on Friday.\"New York Attorney General Letitia James, in a statement on Jackson's order, said, \"This decision is a tragedy for the millions of Americans who rely on SNAP to feed their families.\"\"It is disgraceful that the Trump administration chose to fight this in court instead of fulfilling its responsibility to the American people,\" said James, whose state is one of the plaintiffs in another pending lawsuit seeking for force full SNAP benefits to be paid.\"Every day the federal government delays is another day that children, seniors, and families face real pain and suffering,\" Read more CNBC government shutdown coverageDemocratic leader offers deal to reopen government but Republicans sneerTrump admin asks Supreme Court to block order it pay full SNAP benefitsSNAP benefits must be fully paid by Trump administration by Friday, judge ordersDC sandwich thrower Sean Dunn found not guilty of assaulting federal agentJudge dismisses criminal case against Boeing over Max crashes despite skepticismNancy Pelosi announces retirement from CongressTrump bashes Mamdani after Democrats sweep key electionsSupreme Court justices appear skeptical that Trump tariffs are legalCalifornia voters approve new U.S. House map to boost Democrats in 2026Democrats win big on election night in key racesThe administration last week said it would not pay any SNAP benefits in November because of the federal shutdown, which began on Oct. 1 when Congress failed to pass a bill to provide short-term funding for federal programs, including food stamps. Past administrations have paid the benefits during other shutdowns.A group of plaintiffs, comprised of cities, unions, nonprofits, and a retailer, then sued the administration in Rhode Island federal court, asking McConnell to order that full benefits be paid for the month.McConnell on Oct. 31 ordered the administration to disburse at least partial SNAP benefits as soon as possible by tapping the contingency fund.He also ordered the administration to explore whether other pools of previously appropriated money could be used to fully fund SNAP, which costs about $8 billion per month.The administration on Monday said it would pay 50% of SNAP benefits in November by using the contingency funds. But it refused to use another $4 billion from a Section 32 fund that would have made up the difference in the SNAP payments. The administration two days later said a re-calculation found it could pay 65% of the SNAP benefits from the contingency fund.The plaintiffs then urged McConnell to order the administration to make the full SNAP payments from available funds. The judge did so on Thursday, saying at a hearing that the administration's decision to rule out Section 32 funds was \"arbitrary and capricious.\" \"People have gone without for too long,\" McConnell said.\"The evidence shows that people will go hungry, food pantries will be overburdened, and needless suffering will occur\" if SNAP is not fully funded, he wrote in an order.The administration on Friday morning asked the 1st Circuit appeals court to block McConnell's order, even as the USDA issued its memo to states saying that it intended to comply with the ruling.On Friday night, a three-judge panel on that appeals court denied the administration's request.The panel noted that \"the government has not disputed that it may under [federal law] use the Section 32 fund to cover the provision of SNAP benefits for\" November.But the panel also said that the \"government's motion for a stay pending appeal [of McConnell's order] remains pending, and we intend to issue a decision on that motion as quickly as possible.\"",

    "body": "Palantir co-founder and CEO Alex Karp attends meetings at the U.S. Capitol in Washington on Oct. 18, 2023.Jonathan Ernst | ReutersWith Palantir's stock plummeting more than 11% this week despite a better-than-expected earnings report, CEO Alex Karp took aim at investors betting against the software company. Karp, who co-founded Palantir in 2003, went after short sellers in two separate interviews on CNBC this week. After \"Big Short\" investor Michael Burry revealed bets against Palantir and Nvidia, Karp on Tuesday accused short sellers of \"market manipulation.\" He repeated that message on Friday in an interview with CNBC's Sara Eisen, again knocking Burry's wager against the stock.\"To get out of his position, he had to screw the whole economy by besmirching the best financials ever ... that are helping the average person as investors [and] on the battlefield,\" Karp said.Even with Palantir's slide this week, the stock is up 135% in 2025 and has multiplied 25-fold in the past three years, an extended rally that's lifted the company's market cap to over $420 billion. While revenue and profit are growing rapidly, the multiples have shot up much faster, and the stock now trades for about 220 times forward earnings, a ratio that rivals Tesla's. Nvidia and Meta, by contrast, have forward price-to-earnings ratios of about 33 and 22, respectively. In August, Citron Research's Andrew Left, a noted short seller, called Palantir \"detached from fundamentals and analysis\" and said shares should be priced at $40. It closed on Friday at $177.93 after late-day gains pushed the stock into the green.  watch nowPalantir, which builds analytics tools for large companies and government agencies, reported earnings and revenue on Monday that topped analysts' estimates and issued a forecast that was also ahead of Wall Street projections. But the stock fell about 8% after the report and then slid almost 7% on Thursday. Karp told Eisen that the recent boom in Palantir's share price isn't just for Wall Street. \"We're delivering venture results for retail investors,\" he said. While Palantir has in the past faced a fairly heft dose of short interest, there are currently relatively few investors placing big bets against it. The short interest ratio, or the percentage of outstanding shares being sold short, peaked at over 9% in September and is now at a little over 2%, which is about as low as its been since the company went public in 2020. Still, calling out the doubters is a common occurrence for Karp, who has previously said on CNBC that people should \"exit\" if they \"don't like the price.\"In May, after the stock plummeted following earnings, Karp said ,\"You don't have to buy our shares.\" \"We're happy,\" he said. \"We're going to partner with the world's best people and we're going to dominate. You can be along for the ride or you don't have to be.\"The company has also faced backlash over its work with government agencies like U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and Karp has admitted that his strong pro-Israel stance led some people to leave the company.The boisterous CEO has been particularly vocal this week. On Monday's earnings call, he questioned how happy the people are who didn't invest in the company, and told them to \"get some popcorn.\" And on CNBC he aimed much of his ire at Burry after the investor revealed his short positions in Palantir and Nvidia. \"The two companies he's shorting are the ones making all the money, which is super weird,\" Karp told CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" on Tuesday. \"The idea that chips and ontology is what you want to short is bats--- crazy.\"WATCH: Palantir CEO Karp on short sellerswatch now",

The big question we're asking is whether all this heavy spending will eventually pay off in efficiency or if Wall Street is right to worry about how much they're burning through in the short term.Concerns about AI-stock valuations seeped into the market this week and slammed stocks.Many major tech companies —including the three biggest clouds, Amazon, Microsoft, and Alphabet's Google — raised capital expenditure guidance this earnings season, sparking both investor optimism and concern.Zev Fima, portfolio analyst for the Club, argued the spending is justified: \"Too much focus on the short-term is what leads to falling behind in the long term.\" CNBC reporter Paulina Likos pushed back, noting that \"investors haven't seen efficiency gains show up in returns yet.\"Watch the video above to see where the debate played out on whether AI investments are real productivity drivers or just expensive promises until proven otherwise.(See here for a full list of the stocks in Jim Cramer's Charitable Trust, the portfolio used by the CNBC Investing Club.)As a subscriber to the CNBC Investing Club with Jim Cramer, you will receive a trade alert before Jim makes a trade.

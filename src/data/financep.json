Nathan Posner | Anadolu | Getty ImagesCongressional Democrats rejoiced on Friday and Republicans remained divided in the wake of a momentous Supreme Court decision striking down a large portion of President Donald Trump's tariff agenda.\"Trump's chaotic and illegal tariff tax made life more expensive and our economy more unstable. Families paid more. Small businesses and farmers got squeezed. Markets swung wildly,\" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said in a statement after the decision. \"We've said from day one: a president cannot ignore Congress and unilaterally slap tariffs on Americans. That overreach failed.\"The ruling is a major hit to Trump, who used a novel reading of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, or IEEPA, to slap a barrage of tariffs on American trading partners. Tariffs and the economy more broadly will be a key messaging issue for Democrats on the campaign trail for this year's midterm elections. Primaries start next month leading up to the November general election.The Supreme Court decision sets up additional potential showdowns in Congress over how to handle Trump's trade war after the U.S. House voted last week to overturn tariffs on Canada.Read more CNBC coverage on tariffsSupreme Court strikes down Trump tariffs in rebuke of signature policyTrump announces 10% global tariff after raging over Supreme Court lossTrump tariffs: U.S. could owe $175 billion in refundsWhat the Supreme Court tariff ruling may mean for your moneySmall furniture retailers face existential tariff threat, despite Supreme Court rulingU.S. trade deficit totaled $901 billion in 2025, barely budging despite Trump’s tariffsFor Republicans, Trump's tariffs, which have proven largely unpopular in a pivotal election year, are a more complicated issue.\"SCOTUS's outrageous ruling handcuffs our fight against unfair trade that has devastated American workers for decades. These tariffs protected jobs, revived manufacturing, and forced cheaters like China to pay up,\" Sen. Bernie Moreno, R-Ohio, posted to X. \"This betrayal must be reversed and Republicans must get to work immediately on a reconciliation bill to codify the tariffs that had made our country the hottest country on earth!\" Moreno continued.Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., who has voted with Democrats in opposition to Trump's tariffs, celebrated the decision. He and other opponents of the trade policy have argued that it is Congress, not the president, that has the constitutional authority to enact taxes and tariffs.\"In defense of our Republic, the Supreme Court struck down using emergency powers to enact taxes,\"  Paul posted on X. \"This ruling will also prevent a future President such as AOC from using emergency powers to enact socialism.\"The court ruled a little over a week after a small group of House Republicans joined most of their Democratic colleagues to overturn Trump's 35% tariff of Canada, though the resolution was largely symbolic since it would require approval from the Senate and the White House to take effect.Rep. Don Bacon, R-Neb., one of the six Republicans who voted to overturn the tariffs, called the decision \"a common-sense and straightforward ruling by the Supreme Court.\"\"The Constitution's checks and balances still work. Article One gives tariff authority to Congress,\" Bacon wrote on X. \"In the future, Congress should defend its own authorities and not rely on the Supreme Court.\"Some Democrats suggested Trump would look for other mechanism to impose tariffs, while some Republicans said that he should do so.\"Good news today. The Supreme Court has struck down many of Trump's tariffs. Sadly, this President is absolutely dedicated to making you pay these taxes. He's going to try other ways to keep them in place,\" Sen. Raphael Warnock, D-Ga., said in a post to X. \"I will continue voting to block Trump's reckless tariffs in the Senate.\"In the House, Rep. Steven Horsford, D-Nev., touted his legislation, dubbed the RELIEF Act, that would trigger tariff refunds to small businesses.\"These taxes stole money from working families and small businesses who were forced to pay them from the very beginning. Now, it's time to start repairing the economic damage these Trump taxes have caused,\" Horsford posted to X.The legislation is symbolic because its success would require significant Republican buy-in in the GOP-controlled House and Senate. And many allies of Trump suggested the Supreme Court decision would not be the end of the president's tariff agenda.",

    "body": "The Supreme Court during a rain storm in Washington, Feb. 20, 2026.Annabelle Gordon | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesThe Supreme Court on Friday ruled that President Donald Trump's country-specific \"reciprocal\" tariffs are unconstitutional, delivering a win for many consumer companies facing higher import costs.But the ruling doesn't cover all sectors. The Supreme Court reviewed tariffs enacted under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977, or IEEPA, which the Trump administration used to justify the sweeping tariff agenda. The act had never before been used by a president to impose tariffs.In a 6-3 decision, the Supreme Court ruled that IEEPA \"does not authorize the President to impose tariffs.\" Still, hours after the ruling, Trump announced a new global 10% tariff, and the Supreme Court's ruling does not cover tariffs enacted under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962. Those duties are intended to target specific products that threaten national security, and they remain in effect after Friday's ruling. Separate from his country-specific rates, Trump has raised tariffs on imports of steel, semiconductors, aluminum and other products deemed to impair national security. Here are the sectors still facing higher levies even after the Supreme Court decision.AutosIt's not immediately clear how much the decision will impact the U.S. and global automotive industry. The industry continues to face billions of dollars in tariff costs, depending on where an imported auto part or vehicle originates.The Trump administration last year broadly implemented 25% tariffs on vehicles and certain auto parts imported into the U.S., citing national security risks. It has since struck independent deals to lower the levies to 10% to 15% with countries such as the United Kingdom and Japan. Others, such as South Korea, have also struck deals for lower rates, but it's unclear if those changes have actually taken effect.\"With today's decision out and subsequent developments, there remain many unknowns and important questions still to be answered. This is not a moment to ease up,\" said Lenny LaRocca, U.S. automotive lead for consulting firm KPMG. \"Automakers should continue planning for multiple scenarios and keep supply chain considerations top of mind as the trade and tariff landscape continues to evolve.\"America's largest automaker, General Motors, last month said it expects between $3 billion and $4 billion in tariff costs this year, and Ford Motor earlier this month said its net tariff impact is expected to be roughly flat year over year at $2 billion in 2026.Ford told CNBC in a statement that it is continuing to work with the government on policies that \"promote a strong and globally competitive U.S. auto sector.\" GM did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the Supreme Court decision.PharmaceuticalsThe pharmaceutical industry is facing a lot of uncertainty over tariffs. Trump has repeatedly threatened tariffs on pharmaceutical imports, though they haven't yet taken effect, in part because of negotiated multiyear deals between the administration and drugmakers. If that were to change, however, pharmaceutical tariffs would still be covered under Section 232.The administration has floated imposing tariffs on the industry that could eventually reach up to 250%. Last July, Trump threatened 200% tariffs on pharmaceuticals, and the administration has already opened a Section 232 investigation into pharmaceuticals to investigate the impact of imports on national security.The tariff threats are a move to push drug companies to manufacture in the U.S. instead of abroad. In December, multiple companies inked a deal with Trump to voluntarily lower their prices in exchange for a three-year exemption from any pharma tariffs — as long as they invest further in U.S. manufacturing. That deal included major players like Merck, Bristol Myers Squibb, Novartis and more. FurnitureThe furniture industry found little relief from Friday's Supreme Court ruling.Last fall, items like couches, kitchen cabinets, vanities and more were hit with higher tariffs under Section 232. The roughly 25% duties will remain in place even now that the IEEPA tariffs have been deemed unconstitutional. The furniture industry is already facing greater uncertainty, with the 25% tariff expected to rise to 50% in 2027, and more broad pressures from higher interest rates and inflation. Smaller companies are getting hit the hardest, with fewer resources to work with, while larger companies are facing bankruptcy, like Value City Furniture's parent company, American Signature Furniture, which went out of business late last year.Food and consumer packaged goodsUnder Section 232, steel and aluminum imports into the U.S. are still carry tariffs. With higher aluminum tariffs, companies like Coca-Cola, PepsiCo, Keurig Dr Pepper and Reynolds will continue to face higher costs associated with manufacturing their products.Trump hiked aluminum tariffs to 50% last year.Still, some of the key tariffs for the sector have been rolled back, even before Friday's ruling.In November, Trump issued an executive order exempting several hundred agricultural products, including bananas, coffee and spices, from tariffs. And in September, he similarly rescinded a 10% tariff on Brazilian pulp, a key component of paper towels, diapers and toilet paper.— CNBC's Mike Wayland, Annika Kim Constantino, Gabrielle Fonrouge and Amelia Lucas contributed to this report.",

    "body": "An assortment of Bath & Body Works products.Courtesy of Bath & Body WorksBath & Body Works Champagne Toast bodywash, with no minimum shipping threshold, is now just a click away for Amazon Prime members.The mall-favorite brand is making some of its best-selling fragrances, bodywashes, hand soaps and candles available for Amazon's U.S. shoppers. The selection is also eligible for Prime shipping. Amazon is the No. 1 online destination for U.S. beauty shoppers, accounting for 47% of the online beauty and personal care market in the U.S. in 2024, according to Euromonitor. Sephora is second with 9% share. Euromonitor estimates 39% of all beauty and personal care sales take place online. \"Launching our first authorized brand storefront on Amazon allows us to put ourselves directly in the path of the consumer,\" Bath & Body Works CEO Daniel Heaf told CNBC. \"It's about meeting them where they already shop.\"The Amazon launch marks the latest effort by Columbus, Ohio-based Bath & Body Works to expand its access points for customers. Last year, it began selling its products in college campus stores — with a footprint of now more than 1,000 locations — in the company's first points of sale outside its roughly 2,600 owned and franchised stores and its own website.Heaf joined Bath & Body Works in May after his role as Nike's chief transformation and strategy officer was eliminated by CEO Elliott Hill. Heaf recently laid out his \"plan to return [Bath & Body Works] to profitable, sustainable growth.\" He calls it a \"consumer-first formula\" with four pillars: creating disruptive and innovative products; reigniting the brand; winning in the marketplace; and operating with speed and efficiency.The Amazon partnership, Heaf said, \"is the first of many milestones that we'll be delivering this fiscal year against that strategy.\"Before the official storefront launch, Bath & Body Works products were sold on Amazon through third-party resellers. Now, Heaf says, the company is attempting to reclaim the brand story on Amazon — and those marketplace sales.Amazon: Friend or foe? While Amazon has many first-party relationships with brands from Nike to Calvin Klein that use wholesale partnerships as part of their business models, there are few examples of retailers selling on the site that design, manufacture and sell their products entirely on their own. For those so-called vertically integrated brands, like Bath & Body Works, Amazon is increasingly filling the role of skilled logistics partner rather than retailer. Gap, J.Crew and Everlane are similarly vertically integrated and have small selections of branded products for sale on Amazon. Gap began selling what it calls \"core basics for the whole family\" in 2022 through a wholesale relationship, where Amazon owns and sells the products, which are Prime eligible. Gap has said its goal is to reach new or lapsed customers as well as provide existing shoppers the convenience for \"core essentials.\" Under Bath & Body Works' new agreement with Amazon, the brand will retain ownership of the inventory and control pricing, but will use Amazon's fulfillment partners network for Prime eligibility. Everlane declined to comment on its Amazon partnership. J.Crew did not respond to request for comment.Jewelry company Kendra Scott has an authorized storefront on Amazon after initially opposing the partnership — even though it had wholesale relationships with other retailers, including Macy's and Nordstrom. But over time, the brand began to view Amazon as another opportunity to reach shoppers rather than a competitive threat, according to a person familiar with the company's decision-making, who spoke about internal matters on the condition of anonymity.On its own website, Bath & Body Works is making it easier for shoppers to place their orders. The company lowered its free shipping threshold to $50 from $100 last month. Still, Heaf admits, \"We know that we will never compete with Amazon in terms of their Prime Network. No one is going to be offering next-day shipping. That's just not what we're in the business of. And so I think that by going on Amazon, we are also making our own site more competitive but recognizing that our job is not to build a fulfillment network that can operate at the speed of Amazon.\"",

    "body": "President Donald Trump prepares to board Air Force One en route to Florida, at Pope Army Airfield at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, Feb. 13, 2026.Elizabeth Frantz | ReutersPresident Donald Trump said Friday that he is considering limited military strikes to pressure Iran over its nuclear program. \"I guess I can say I am considering that,\" Trump said when asked by a reporter at a White House breakfast with U.S. governors. Trump said Thursday that he would make a decision in the next 10 to 15 days on whether to attack the Islamic Republic. He has left open the possibility that a deal could still be reached with Tehran over its nuclear program. Trump has previously said an attack on Iran would be \"far worse\" than the limited strikes launched by the U.S. in June against its nuclear facilities.Oil prices were stable Friday after rallying more than 5% this week as traders price in some risk of imminent U.S. military action. U.S. crude oil fell 4 cents to close at $66.39 per barrel. Global benchmark Brent rose 10 cents to settle at $71.76 per barrel.A massive U.S. military buildup is underway in the Middle East. The USS Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier is in the region. A second aircraft carrier, the USS Gerald Ford, is en route. The oil market's biggest fear is that a conflict between the U.S. and Iran could lead to a prolonged disruption of oil flows through the Strait of Hormuz. The strait is a vital chokepoint for the global oil trade. More than 14 million barrels per day of oil and condensates passed through the narrow waterway on average in 2025, according to data from consulting firm Kpler, which says that amount accounts for a third of total worldwide seaborne oil exports.About three-quarters of the oil that passes through the strait goes to China, India, Japan and South Korea, according to Kpler.watch now",

The artificial intelligence company is providing a lower number and more defined timeline for its planned spending, sources told CNBC, as broader concerns mounted that expansion ambitions were too great for the potential revenue that would follow.OpenAI is projecting that its total revenue for 2030 will be more than $280 billion, with nearly equal contributions from its consumer and enterprise businesses, said the sources, who asked not to be named because the information is private. The spending plan the company is offering is meant to more directly tie to its expected revenue growth, the people said. In the back half of last year, OpenAI announced a flurry of multibillion-dollar infrastructure deals, partnering with leading chipmakers and cloud companies. OpenAI is finalizing a massive funding round that could total more than $100 billion, with about 90% coming from strategic investors, one person said. Nvidia is in discussions to invest up to $30 billion in OpenAI as part of the round that could value the company at a $730 billion pre-money valuation, CNBC has confirmed.In addition to Nvidia, strategic investors in the funding include SoftBank and Amazon. OpenAI generated $13.1 billion in revenue in 2025, the sources said, up from its $10 billion target. The company burned through $8 billion, lower than its $9 billion target, they said. The startup was founded as a nonprofit research lab in 2015, and it rocketed into the mainstream following the launch of its chatbot ChatGPT in 2022. ChatGPT now supports more than 900 million weekly active users, the people said, up from 800 million as of October. OpenAI declared a \"code red\" in December to focus on improving the chatbot in the face of competition from rivals Google and Anthropic. ChatGPT had a dip in growth in the fall, but is back to record highs in both weekly active and daily active users, the people said.The company's coding product, Codex, has surpassed more than 1.5 million weekly active users, the people said. Codex competes directly with Anthropic's Claude Code, which has seen a wave of adoption over the last year.WATCH: Watch CNBC’s full interview with OpenAI CEO Sam Altmanwatch now",

    "body": "Customers at a Ford dealership in Richmond, California, April 16, 2025.David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesDETROIT — The strength of the U.S. automotive industry will face an early test this spring that has nothing to do with cars or trucks.With tax season starting, industry experts are projecting that some Americans, many of whom have been priced out of the new-vehicle market, will use anticipated higher tax returns to purchase a new or used vehicle.Extra cash on hand could lend a needed boost to an industry that's suffering from slowing vehicle sales — or it could reveal continued problems for the automotive industry with inflated prices and consumers still reluctant to spend on big-ticket items.\"Their new tax bill is actually going to be less, and they're going to be getting more in their tax return. It's going to be a little bit of a surprise, we think, for a lot of potential buyers out there,\" said Cox Automotive senior economist Charlie Chesbrough at a recent auto analyst conference.The average IRS tax refund is up 10.9% so far this season, compared with the same point in 2025, according to early filing data. As of Feb. 6, the average refund amount was $2,290, compared with $2,065 reported about one year prior.The increases were expected under tax changes by the Trump administration, including the One Big Beautiful Bill Act signed in July. That legislation removed taxes on overtime and tips and allowed eligible taxpayers to deduct up to $10,000 in annual interest paid on loans for new, U.S.-assembled vehicles purchased, among other adjustments. Stock Chart IconStock chart iconAuto dealer stocksMany of the tax changes were made retroactive to January 2025, which means taxpayers may have withheld more than they will ultimately owe.\"Although it's a bit of an unknown, it feels like it could be really beneficial to vehicle sales, particularly in that sort of Q1-Q2 time frame,\" said David Oakley, GlobalData manager of Americas vehicle sales forecasts.March is historically one of the top months for U.S. vehicle sales, especially for used vehicles. The month has represented 9.1% of annual new vehicle sales on average over the past 12 years, according to Cox, trailing only the month of December at 9.3% of sales. Many of the recent tax changes also assist middle- and higher-income consumers who may decide to pull ahead a vehicle purchase. The industry saw a similar dynamic during the Covid pandemic when the Trump administration issued many Americans $1,400 stimulus checks.Back then, though, federal interest rates were near zero compared to the current Federal Reserve funds rate of 3.5% to 3.75%, and the inventory of new vehicles was low. Now, with higher borrowing costs, but improved inventory, the equation could be different. More buyers are agreeing to longer-term loans amid higher financing costs and prices. Putting down extra cash can help lower monthly payments, which Carmax's Edmunds reports reached a record of $772 per month for new vehicles during the fourth quarter.The average transaction price for new vehicles in the U.S. was hovering around $50,000 toward the end of last year, up 30% from the start of 2020, according to Cox.\"What we don't know is with consumer finance so stressed already, is that extra money already spent? Whether that's going to be in the pockets. It's a really mixed bag out there,\" Chesbrough said. Consumers could choose to use higher tax returns to pay off credit card debt — which nationally stands at a record level of $1.28 trillion, according to a report last week by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York — or replenish their savings after a period of persistent inflation. U.S. consumer confidence fell to 84.5 in January, the lowest level since May 2014, driven by intense anxiety over high prices and a weakening labor market.\"It's only confident people, people who feel comfortable about their economic fortunes of the economy of the United States, that are going to be interested in taking out a $40,000 or $50,000 auto loan,\" Chesbrough said. \"It's a very difficult situation right now.\"— CNBC's Kate Dore contributed to this report.",

    "body": "People walk near a sign outside of Google headquarters in Mountain View, California. Justin Sullivan | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesA federal grand jury indicted three Silicon Valley engineers on charges of stealing trade secrets from Google and other technology companies and transferring sensitive data to Iran, prosecutors said Thursday.Samaneh Ghandali, 41, her sister Soroor Ghandali, 32, and Mohammadjavad Khosravi, 40 — all residents of San Jose — were arrested Thursday and appeared in a federal district court the same day.The indictment identified the defendants as Iranian nationals. Soroor was in the U.S. on a nonimmigrant student visa. Samaneh later became a U.S. citizen, and Khosravi, her husband, became a U.S. legal permanent resident. Prosecutors said that Khosravi previously served in the Iranian army.The trio faces charges of conspiracy to commit trade secret theft, theft and attempted theft of trade secrets, and obstruction of justice, according to the U.S. attorney's office for the Northern District of California.Prosecutors alleged the three defendants exploited their positions at leading technology firms that develop mobile computer processors to obtain hundreds of confidential files, including materials related to processor security and cryptography. Samaneh and Soroor worked at Google before joining a third company identified only as Company 3. Khosravi worked at a separate firm referred to as Company 2, which develops system-on-chip (SoC) platforms such as the Snapdragon series for smartphones and other mobile devices.SoC is a semiconductor that integrates numerous components, such as graphics processing units and memory, into a power-efficient package. Common SoCs include Qualcomm's Snapdragon, found in most high-end Android phones, and Apple's A-series for iPhones.In a statement to CNBC, Google said it had detected the alleged theft through routine security monitoring before referring the case to law enforcement. \"We have enhanced safeguards to protect our confidential information and immediately alerted law enforcement after discovering this incident,\" spokesman José Castañeda said. The tech giant also pointed to measures to protect its trade secrets, including restricting employees' access to sensitive information, two-factor authentication for work-related Google accounts and logging file transfers to third-party platforms such as Telegram. Alleged efforts to concealAuthorities alleged the defendants routed stolen files through a third-party communications platform to channels bearing each of their first names, before copying the material to personal devices, each other's work devices, and to Iran. \"The method in which confidential data was transferred by the defendants involved deliberate steps to evade detection and conceal their identities,\" said FBI Special Agent in Charge Sanjay Virmani. The defendants sought to cover their tracks after Google's internal security systems flagged Samaneh's activity and revoked her access to company resources in August 2023. According to the indictment, she signed an affidavit falsely claiming she had not shared Google's confidential information outside the company. During that period, a personal laptop linked to Samaneh and Khosravi was used to search for methods to delete communications and to research how long mobile carriers retain message records, prosecutors said.The couple also allegedly photographed hundreds of computer screens containing confidential information from Google and Company 2, in what appeared to be an attempt at circumventing digital monitoring tools. On the night before the pair traveled to Iran in December 2023, Samaneh allegedly took about 24 photos of Khosravi's work computer screen containing Company 2's trade secrets, including its Snapdragon SoCs. Prosecutors allege that while in Iran, a device linked to Samaneh accessed those photographs, while Khosravi accessed additional Company 2's proprietary information, such as Snapdragon SoC hardware architecture.Prosecutors said in the indictment that Snapdragon SoC trade secrets had independent economic value because they were not generally known and could not be readily obtained from Company 2's competitors, who could benefit from their disclosure or use. If convicted, each defendant faces up to 10 years in prison for each trade secret charge and up to 20 years for obstruction of justice, along with fines of up to $250,000 per count.",

    "body": "U.S. growth slowed more than expected near the end of 2025 as the government shutdown impacted spending and investment, while a key inflation metric showed high prices are still a factor for the economy, according to data released Friday.Gross domestic product rose at an annualized rate of just 1.4%, according to the Commerce Department, well below the Dow Jones estimate for a 2.5% gain. Consumer spending increased at a slower pace for the period while government spending tumbled sharply in a quarter marked by the record-length shutdown. The department estimated that the shutdown subtracted about 1 percentage point from growth, though it added that the exact impacts \"cannot be quantified.\"For the full year in 2025, the U.S. economy grew at a 2.2% pace, down from the 2.8% increase in 2024. \"The Federal government shutdown clearly sent the economy careening off its strong growth path in the fourth quarter which is a one-off that won't be repeated in early 2026,\" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at Fwdbonds.Just before the data release, President Donald Trump warned that the GDP number would be soft, blaming it on the government shutdown that ended in November.\"The Democrat Shutdown cost the U.S.A. at least two points in GDP. That's why they are doing it, in mini form, again. No Shutdowns!\" Trump said in a Truth Social post. \"Also, LOWER INTEREST RATES. 'Two Late' Powell is the WORST!!!\"The latter part of the post was a reference to Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, whom Trump has repeatedly criticized for not lowering rates more aggressively.While growth slowed, inflation held firm in December, according to the gauge most closely watched by Fed officials.The core personal consumption expenditures price index, which excludes food and energy, rose 3% in December, up 0.2 percentage point from November, according to a separate release. That matched the consensus forecast but kept the pivotal inflation measure well above the Fed's 2% target.On a headline basis, the PCE index accelerated 2.9%, or 0.1 percentage point higher than expected. Both indexes rose 0.4% for the month, compared with the respective forecasts for 0.3%.On a monthly basis, goods prices climbed 0.4% while services increased 0.3%, indicating that price pressures remained relatively broad-based rather than concentrated in any single category. Fed policymakers have been watching that balance closely to see whether inflation is being spurred by temporary tariff-related pressures that would hit goods, or more fundamental demand-driven factors that would show up in services.The Fed cut its benchmark rate by three-quarters of a percentage point in late 2025 but has since signaled a more cautious approach as officials assess progress on inflation alongside risks to the labor market.While Trump blamed the shutdown, the Commerce Department said the deceleration in GDP, which grew at a 4.4% rate in the third quarter, was the result in a pullback in consumer spending and exports, as well as the impact from the government closure that ran from Oct. 1 to Nov. 12.\"The government shutdown hurt growth at the end of 2025. The economy will likely bounce back in early 2026, but it isn't harmless to do prolonged shutdowns,\" said Heather Long, chief economist at Navy Federal Credit Union. \"Overall, the U.S. economy was resilient in 2025 despite many headwinds. Solid consumption and the AI boom kept the economy growing.\"Personal consumption expenditures, a proxy for consumer outlays, rose 2.4% in the quarter, down from the 3.5% gain in the prior period. Exports fell 0.9% after surging 9.6% in Q3.Though the headline GDP number looked weak, underlying signs of demand were strong.Another key Fed metric, called final sales to private domestic purchasers, posted a 2.4% increase for the quarter, half a percentage point lower than the prior quarter but still indicative of solid underlying demand in the $31.5 trillion U.S. economy.Also, gross private domestic investment rose 3.8% after being flat in Q3.On the downside, government spending and investment slid 5.1%, slammed by a 16.6% tumble at the federal level that was only partially offset by a 2.4% increase from state and local entities. Correction: Final sales to private domestic purchasers posted a 2.4% increase for the quarter, half a percentage point lower than the prior quarter. An earlier version misstated a time element.",

    "body": "watch nowThe retail industry on Friday said the Supreme Court's ruling that struck down some of President Donald Trump's global tariffs would usher in more predictability and free up businesses from the burden of higher import costs. \"The Supreme Court's announcement today regarding tariffs provides much-needed certainty for U.S. businesses and manufacturers, enabling global supply chains to operate without ambiguity,\" the National Retail Federation said in a statement following the ruling. \"Clear and consistent trade policy is essential for economic growth, creating jobs and opportunities for American families.\"The nation's highest court determined that Trump's broad tariff rates on U.S. trade partners enacted under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, or IEEPA, overstepped the president's authority. The Supreme Court is sending the case back to the lower court for dismissal.Yet the reversal has raised fresh questions about whether retailers and U.S. consumers will meaningfully feel a financial impact and if the decision means more uncertainty or less.Just hours after the ruling was handed down, Trump condemned the ruling and said his administration has \"alternatives,\" referencing sector-specific tariffs and announcing a new, global tariff rate of 10%. It's also unclear if, when and how the government may refund tariffs that have already been paid and were deemed unconstitutional. \"We urge the lower court to ensure a seamless process to refund the tariffs to U.S. importers,\" the NRF said in its statement. \"The refunds will serve as an economic boost and allow companies to reinvest in their operations, their employees and their customers.\"The NRF represents a number of U.S. retailers, from big-box retailers such as Walmart to smaller brands and manufacturers. In an interview with CNBC on Friday afternoon, David French, executive vice president of government relations for NRF, acknowledged that retailers continue to face other tariffs and may face new ones, based on Trump's remarks. \"The president has lots of other tariff tools in the toolbox ,and we certainly expect he will use these tools to advance his tariff agenda and maintain leverage in negotiations with other countries,\" he said. \"The good thing about the ruling today is it takes one of the tools away from him and will build a little bit more of certainty into the tariff process.\"Compared with Trump's broad use of IEEPA, alternative tariffs that the president imposed on Friday \"have inherit limitations,\" French said. Some of those tariffs would come with time limits or require the administration to clear additional hurdles. And, he said, if companies get a refund of tariffs they paid, they could put it toward investing in their businesses, hiring more workers or lowering prices. He said the trade group is \"hopeful the president comes to the conclusion that getting the refunds out as quickly and as simply as possible would be in everybody's best interest\" — noting it could also help Trump ahead of the midterm elections.In December, warehouse club Costco sued the Trump administration to get a full refund of the tariffs it had paid and to block import duties from continuing. In the lawsuit, filed in the U.S. Court of International Trade, Costco said it risked losing money it has already paid even if the Supreme Court ruled against the tariffs. Costco did not respond to a request for comment about the Supreme Court decision and what it means for the retailer's lawsuit. While Friday's ruling is largely positive for the retail industry, the idea that it brings more predictability and lower costs is likely \"a pipe dream,\" said Steven Shemesh, a retail analyst for RBC Capital Markets. \"This administration is pretty adamant about tariffs and trade balance, and if it doesn't come this way, I'm pretty certain it will come in another way,\" he said prior to Trump's announcement of new tariffs. \"It may have another look, shape, size, smell, but I think it will end up looking similar.\"Apparel and footwear Clothing, footwear and discretionary items were among the imports most vulnerable to Trump's tariffs, which imposed steep rates on countries such as China and Vietnam, where the retail industry maintains large portions of its supply chain. Footwear has been one of the most heavily affected industries, since nearly 100% of all footwear sold in the U.S. is imported, according to Footwear Distributors and Retailers of America, the industry's trade group.Even before Trump's first term, footwear manufacturers were moving some sourcing out of China as its labor force shrank, said Matt Priest, CEO of the FDRA. Yet it would be unrealistic to return production to the U.S., he said, and moving it to another part of Asia can be difficult.In an interview with CNBC on Friday, Priest said the decision is a step toward more predictability for the footwear industry because it limits tariffs that Trump can use to ones that \"are not as sweeping\" and may require Congress' input. \"Even if it's still uncertain to some degree, we are not on that playing field where we have those exorbitant tariffs,\" he said.The trade group, which includes well-known footwear companies and brands such as Nike, Crocs and Puma, held an emergency videoconference with 325 companies Friday afternoon. Priest said trade group members were upbeat but also had a lot of questions. Among them, members asked about when or if they would get refunds and when the IEEPA tariffs would officially be stopped, specifically whether they would still hit shipments that arrive in the coming days. Priest said he doesn't anticipate that refunds will come quickly and that the trade group has coached members against banking on them. He said the group's work continues, as it tries to work with the Trump administration and Congress to nudge them toward \"a more surgical, thoughtful approach\" to tariffs. On the call with trade group members, Priest said, \"There was optimism that this part of this journey was at least somewhat being redirected,\" and he described the ruling as \"a win\" for the industry. But, he added, without the refund and other details spelled out yet, \"it's a long way to go.\"",

    "body": "Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announces new nutrition policies during a press conference in Washington, Jan. 8, 2026.Jonathan Ernst | ReutersSecretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr. defended President Donald Trump's executive order spurring the domestic production of the weed killer glyphosate, as his Make America Healthy Again movement reels from the president's embrace of the chemical they despise.Trump on Wednesday night signed an executive order invoking the Defense Production Act to compel the domestic production of elemental phosphorus and glyphosate-based herbicides. Glyphosate is the chemical in Bayer-Monsanto's Roundup and is the most commonly used herbicide for a slew of U.S. crops. Trump, in the order, said shortages of both phosphorus and glyphosate would pose a risk to national security.Kennedy backed the president in a statement to CNBC Thursday morning. \"Donald Trump's Executive Order puts America first where it matters most — our defense readiness and our food supply,\" he said. \"We must safeguard America's national security first, because all of our priorities depend on it. When hostile actors control critical inputs, they weaken our security. By expanding domestic production, we close that gap and protect American families.\"But Kennedy's MAHA coalition that supported Trump in the 2024 presidential election hates glyphosate, which has been alleged to cause cancer in myriad lawsuits. Now, the executive order threatens to unravel that coalition ahead of the 2026 midterm elections that could loosen the president's grip on Washington. \"Just as the large MAHA base begins to consider what to do at midterms, the President issues an EO to expand domestic glyphosate production,\" Kelly Ryerson, a prominent MAHA activist known as The Glyphosate Girl, said in a post on X. \"The very same carcinogenic pesticide that MAHA cares about most.\"Ken Cook, president of the Environmental Working Group, a watchdog that has pushed back against chemicals in food for years, said in a statement that he \"can't envision a bigger middle finger to every MAHA mom than this.\"\"Elevating glyphosate to a national security priority is the exact opposite of what MAHA voters were promised,\" Cook said. \"If Secretary Kennedy remains at HHS after this, it will be impossible to argue that his past warnings about glyphosate were anything more than campaign rhetoric designed to win trust — and votes.\"Kennedy, a former environmental attorney, notably once won a nearly $290 million case against Monsanto for a man who claimed his cancer was caused by Roundup. The executive order came down one day after Bayer proposed paying $7.25 billion to settle a series of lawsuits claiming Roundup causes cancer. Former Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., knocked Trump for signing \"an EO protecting cancer causing Glyphosate in our foods.\"Glyphosate is a critical chemical to American agriculture. It's applied to many key cash crops, such as corn and soybeans, and has been defended by agricultural trade organizations. Phosphorus is a key input to the creation of glyphosate, which the White House argues is necessary to maintain food security. Elemental phosphorus is also used in the manufacture of some military materials.\"Thank you, President Trump, for acknowledging the importance of glyphosate-based herbicides in American agriculture,\" the House Agriculture Committee Republicans said Wednesday night in an X post. \"This is a vital step forward in ensuring a domestic supply of this critical crop input remains available for our producers.\"House Agriculture Chair Rep. G.T. Thompson, R-Pa., is trying to push a farm bill through Congress this year — a legislative package that covers federal farm support and nutrition subsidies. He's also come under fire from MAHA recently for a provision in that bill that would block state and local pesticide regulations from differing from federal guidance.",

Some governments, like Vietnam and Brazil are still in negotiation.A U.K. government spokesperson said the country would continue to work with the White House administration to understand how the ruling will affect tariffs for the U.K. and the rest of the world\"This is a matter for the U.S. to determine but we will continue to support U.K. businesses as further details are announced,\" the spokesperson said.\"The U.K. enjoys the lowest reciprocal tariffs globally, and under any scenario we expect our privileged trading position with the U.S. to continue.\" The U.K. agreed a wide-ranging trade deal with the U.S. in May last year, which imposed a broad 10% levy on many goods, but also included certain carve-outs on steel, aluminium, cars and pharmaceuticals.The Supreme Court case focused mainly on reciprocal tariffs, and the ruling leaves much of the U.K.'s trade deal with the U.S. — including preferential sectoral tariffs on steel, pharmaceuticals and autos — unaffected.However, the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) trade body said the U.S. Supreme Court decision adds to the ongoing uncertainty around levies.watch nowWilliam Bain, head of trade policy at the BCC, said the move \"does little to clear the murky waters\" for British businesses, warning that the President still has \"other options at his disposal\" to retain his current regime on steel and aluminium tariffs.  \"The court's decision also raises questions on how U.S. importers can reclaim levies already paid and whether U.K. exporters can also receive a share of any rebate depending on commercial trading terms,\" Bain said in a statement. \"For the U.K., the priority remains bringing tariffs down wherever possible.\"Olof Gill, European Commission spokesperson for trade and economic security, said businesses on both sides of the Atlantic depend on \"stability and predictability.\" \"We remain in close contact with the U.S. Administration as we seek clarity on the steps they intend to take in response to this ruling,\" Gill said. \"We therefore continue to advocate for low tariffs and to work towards reducing them.\"Meanwhile, Dominic LeBlanc, Canada's minister for U.S.-Canadian trade relations, said the decision \"reinforces Canada's position that the IEEPA tariffs imposed by the United States are unjustified.\"No trade 'win' yetElsewhere, Swissmem, Switzerland's technology industry association, welcomed the ruling — but warned that the Trump administration could invoke other laws to \"legitimize tariffs,\" and called on Swiss policymakers to strengthen the competitiveness of the country with new free trade agreements.\"From the perspective of the Swiss export industry, this is a good decision. The high tariffs have severely damaged the tech industry. However, today's ruling doesn't win anything yet,\" Swissmem said.\"The high tariffs have severely damaged the tech industry,\" Swissmem wrote on X. \"The crucial thing now is to quickly secure relations with the U.S. through a binding trade agreement.\"The International Chamber of Commerce noted that many businesses will welcome the ruling given the \"significant strain\" that has been placed on balance sheets in recent months.\"But companies should not expect a simple process: the structure of U.S. import procedures means claims are likely to be administratively complex. Today's ruling is worrying silent on this issue and clear guidance from the Court of International Trade and the relevant U.S. authorities will be essential to minimise avoidable costs and prevent litigation risks,\" the ICC said.— CNBC's Jackson Peck and Greg Kennedy helped contribute to this story.",

    "body": "Phil Spencer, CEO of Microsoft Gaming, appears at the Political Opening of the Gamescom conference in Cologne, Germany, on Aug. 23, 2023.Franziska Krug | German Select | Getty ImagesMicrosoft's head of gaming, Phil Spencer, is leaving the software maker following a 38-year tenure, as the company's Xbox business faces increased challenges.\"Last year, Phil Spencer made the decision to retire from the company, and since then we've been talking about succession planning,\" Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella wrote in a memo to employees that was published on Friday. \"I want to thank Phil for his extraordinary leadership and partnership.\" Spencer's exit follows the departures of business development chief Chris Young and GitHub CEO Thomas Dohmke in 2025. Charlie Bell, who had been Microsoft's most high-ranking security leader, switched to an individual contributor role earlier this month.Revenue from video games at Microsoft declined about 10% in the December quarter from a year earlier, a steeper drop than the company expected, while total revenue grew nearly 17%. Microsoft announced an unspecified impairment charge in its gaming business in January.The company made a $75 billion bet to expand its games business with the 2023 acquisition of Activision Blizzard, and it released Call of Duty titles as a cloud service. But current generation Xbox consoles haven't been as popular as Sony's PlayStation or Nintendo's Switch, and Microsoft has shuttered studios working on new games.Nadella said in the memo that Spencer, who took charge of Xbox in 2014 after running the company's gaming studios, nearly tripled Microsoft's gaming business, in part through acquisitions like Activision Blizzard. Spencer also pushed for Microsoft to take over Minecraft developer Mojang. \"Over 38 years at Microsoft, including 12 years leading Gaming, Phil helped transform what we do and how we do it,\" Nadella wrote.After Nadella became CEO in 2014, Sony was selling more consoles than Microsoft, and investors had floated the idea of spinning out consumer assets such as Xbox. Analyst Rick Sherlund of Nomura estimated that the division could lose more than $1 billion for the year.\"The question is, do we go forward with Xbox?\" Spencer said in a 2020 interview with gaming website Shacknews. Spencer said he persuaded Nadella to bring hardware, software and game-development groups into one organization.Asha Sharma, who joined Microsoft in 2024 from Instacart, will take over for Spencer, becoming CEO of gaming and reporting to Nadella. Until now, she has been president of product in Microsoft's Core AI business, which former Meta executive Jay Parikh runs. Before arriving at Instacart in 2021 and serving as operating chief, Sharma spent four years as a vice president of product and engineering at Meta and two years in marketing at Microsoft. \"We will recommit to our core Xbox fans and players, those who have invested with us for the past 25 years, and to the developers who build the expansive universes and experiences that are embraced by players across the world,\" Sharma wrote in a message to Microsoft's gaming employees.She has worked on artificial intelligence products such as the Foundry for incorporating AI models into third-party applications. \"As monetization and AI evolve and influence this future, we will not chase short-term efficiency or flood our ecosystem with soulless AI slop,\" Sharma wrote. \"Games are and always will be art, crafted by humans, and created with the most innovative technology provided by us.\" Sharma said Microsoft will renew its commitment to console gaming. Microsoft's original Xbox came out in 2001.Matt Booty, head of Microsoft's gaming studios, will report to Sharma as executive vice president and chief content officer.\"Together, Asha and Matt have the right combination of consumer product leadership and gaming depth to push our platform innovation and content pipeline forward,\" Nadella wrote.Sarah Bond, president and operating chief of the Xbox unit, will leave Microsoft.\"I've had the privilege of spending time with Asha over the last few weeks as we've planned for this transition, and I've seen firsthand her deep commitment to our players, developers, and brand,\" Bond told Xbox employees in a message she also posted to LinkedIn. \"She brings deep technology and commerce experience, along with a strong track record of building and scaling platforms that the world uses. Xbox deserves this.\"Bond and Spencer both said they will advise Sharma on the transition.WATCH: Microsoft is still a buy for the longer term investor, says CFRA's Sam Stovall",

Chip Somodevilla | Getty ImagesForty minutes before the federal government revealed that economic growth slowed sharply in the last quarter, President Donald Trump dropped a hint that the incoming data would be weaker.\"The Democrat Shutdown cost the U.S.A. at least two points in GDP. That's why they are doing it, in mini form, again,\" Trump wrote in a Truth Social post at 7:50 a.m. ET.At 8:30 a.m., the Commerce Department reported that U.S. gross domestic product rose at an annualized rate of just 1.4% in the fourth quarter of 2025. That's a decline of 3 percentage points from the previous three-month period. Trump's Friday morning post referred to last year's record-length government shutdown, which began Oct. 1 — the start of the fourth quarter — and lasted 43 days.The federal funding lapse was expected to take a toll on GDP. The U.S. Congressional Budget Office estimated that, depending on its length, the shutdown would shrink annualized real GDP growth in Q4 by up to 2 percentage points.But economists from Dow Jones were still estimating a 2.5% gain for the period.Trump has previously revealed economic data before its official release, raising questions about possible policy violations and concerns that traders may be getting a heads-up from the president, who can be briefed on the data before it comes out. The Office of Management and Budget not only prohibits executive branch officials from commenting early on such releases, but forbids public statements about them until 30 minutes after they have come out.A White House official defended Trump's post, telling CNBC on condition of anonymity that the president has consistently pointed out how the shutdown has been a drag on the economy, including by sharing GDP percentage figures \"consistent with his 2% Truth this morning.\"In a Truth Social post in January, Trump indirectly revealed forthcoming nonfarm payrolls data.The White House at the time admitted that there was an \"inadvertent public disclosure of aggregate data\" while attacking the media for \"grasping at straws to foment another fake controversy.\"During his first presidential term, Trump signaled optimism about a blowout jobs report shortly before its release.Trump's post Friday morning also reiterated his long-running criticism of Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell over his refusal to lower interest rates as sharply or quickly as the president wants.\"Also, LOWER INTEREST RATES. 'Two Late' Powell is the WORST!!!\" Trump wrote.He has previously branded Powell with the derisive nickname \"Too Late\"; it was unclear if the president meant to misspell the nickname in Friday's post.The White House did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment on Trump's social media post.watch now",

    "body": "watch nowParked along industrial streets, tucked behind warehouses and clustered in residential neighborhoods, thousands of Bay Area residents are living in one of the only forms of housing they can afford: RVs.Across California, the number of people living in vehicles has surged in recent years, as soaring rents and a chronic housing shortage have pushed even full-time workers out of traditional homes and into makeshift ones on wheels. Booming tech wealth, soaring homelessnessIn Santa Clara County — home to Apple, Google and eight of America's 50 most expensive ZIP codes — the number of people living in recreational vehicles full time has surged. County data shows that the portion of homeless individuals sleeping in vehicles has more than doubled since the pandemic, from 18% in 2019 to 37% in 2025. California accounts for nearly a quarter of the nation's homeless residents, despite being home to 12% of its total population, according to federal housing data. Experts say the state faces a massive housing shortage, with one estimate by McKinsey suggesting California needs as many as 3.5 million more homes to meet demand. And even as officials have expanded shelter capacity, federal data shows far fewer shelter beds available than people experiencing homelessness, leaving a significant share of unhoused residents without adequate access to shelter.\"In California, you're more likely to become homeless than almost any other state,\" said Adrian Covert, senior vice president of public policy for the Bay Area Council, a nonpartisan think tank. \"And when you do, you're more likely to become homeless on the streets rather than in the shelter than almost any other state.\"Why RVs?Advocates say many people turn to RVs because they offer a degree of autonomy that shelters and the street do not.\"The RV was a lot better,\" said Salena Alvarez, who has lived in an RV with her boyfriend for a year and a half. Before living in their RV, the couple lived in a car. \"The car is smaller … you can't cook, you can't wash your dishes, you can't take a shower, you can't go to the bathroom. You've got to go somewhere.\"Salena Alvarez is a resident at the Berryessa Supportive Parking site in San Jose, California. She's lived in an RV for a year and a half.CNBCThe RV was a lot better. The car is smaller ... you can't cook, you can't wash your dishes, you can't take a shower, you can't go to the bathroom. You've got to go somewhere.Salena AlvarezRV residentThe rise of 'vanlords'As housing options narrow, a new tier of the crisis has emerged — one where even vehicles have become rental properties.A shadow rental market has taken hold across the Bay Area, where individuals rent out aging RVs to people with few other options. Some call them \"vanlords.\"Renters pay hundreds of dollars per month to sleep in a vehicle parked on a public street. The arrangements typically come without written leases or tenant protections.CNBC spoke with one vanlord and several tenants. Some tenants were immigrants, newly arrived in the U.S., including one woman and her two children from Mexico, while others said the option was simply more affordable than traditional apartment housing in the Bay Area. One individual told CNBC he'd been living in an RV on the street in San Francisco for about a year, splitting it with a friend for a total of $500 a month. They rent from the owner of a stretch of vehicles on the same block, calling it \"safe and comfortable,\" adding that $1,000 to rent a room in an apartment was too expensive.But lawmakers see the arrangements as exploitative.\"These are folks who are using our public streets for revenue, to make money without any kind of permitting or process to make sure that they're following any rules about what conditions the RVs have to be in, or what rights the person has who rents has,\" said David Cohen, a city councilmember in San Jose, who sponsored legislation to ban the practice. \"We're trying to protect our community as well as protect the people who are unhoused.\"But cracking down on vanlords has been difficult, and the underground market persists.Meanwhile, cities across the Bay Area have ramped up parking enforcement, issuing citations and towing vehicles as RV encampments have become more visible.Yet neither approach — banning vanlords nor cracking down on parking — has reversed the growth of vehicle homelessness.That's left officials searching for alternatives.A different approachIn an industrial corner of San Jose, just off the freeway and nestled between a recycling plant and a concrete distributor, the city of San Jose has converted an empty parking lot into what it calls a \"safe parking site.\"Operated by a local nonprofit and funded by a grant from the city, the Berryessa Safe Parking Site has space for 86 RVs, making it one of the largest sites of its kind in California, according to WeHope, the homelessness organization that operates it. The park opened in 2025, and organizers say it consistently has a full waiting list. Alvarez, a full-time in-home care worker, is one of its residents.In the center of the 6-acre lot sits a bank of showers, laundry machines and an office, where case workers meet with residents to help them find housing. Engaging with the system – working to move out of RVs and into traditional housing – is a requirement to live at the park. The city expects the site will cost $24 million over a five-year period, including the cost of the services it provides.The site's manager, Victoria Garibaldi, said she and her team have placed upward of 40 people in housing since the site opened. Victoria Garibaldi, a program manager with WeHOPE, oversees the city’s safe-parking site. She says the program has helped more than 40 residents secure permanent housing.CNBC\"We want them to have their own places. This isn't a permanent solution to the housing problem,\" she said. The park is San Jose's second safe parking site. Despite its success, the need far outweighs the supply. San Jose has 128 spots like these across two safe parking sites, but estimates that nearly 1,000 people live in vehicles within its city limits.Other cities in the Bay Area have tried similar ideas, but experienced more friction. San Francisco established a safe parking site in 2022, originally designed to accommodate up to 150 vehicles. But the program never reached that scale.At its peak, the site housed roughly 35 vehicles, according to the San Francisco Chronicle. Infrastructure challenges — including a lack of on-site electricity — forced the city to rely on diesel generators, drawing complaints from neighbors and sparking a lawsuit. The city ultimately shut the site down, citing cost and operational challenges.Today, what may be the only designated RV parking site in San Francisco is privately operated. Once a low-cost option for tourists, Candlestick RV Park, in the city's industrial southeast corner, has increasingly become home to long-term residents, many of whom work but lack the savings or credit to secure a more traditional lease.\"We've transitioned from basically a tourist park to a long-term park, mainly due to the effects of the pandemic,\" said Tsin Fung, the park's manager, who has worked there since 1993.The price for a spot — which includes water, electricity, sewage hookups and bathrooms — is $2,500 per month. The park recently raised the rate for new tenants from $2,000 per month. \"They're hard-working people, and they're sort of middle-, lower-middle class, working class,\" Fung said. \"They work hard, they pay their bills.\" He also noted that he's become aware of some tenants renting their RVs from individuals outside the park, in so-called vanlording situations.\"We've transitioned from basically a tourist park to a long-term park, mainly due to the effects of the pandemic.\" Tsin FungRV park manager in San FranciscoRethinking RV parksBut housing construction alone may not close the gap quickly enough, said Covert of the Bay Area Council.\"We're coming off of 30- or 40-year trends of hostility from local governments across the state — really, across the country — toward mobile home parks and RV parks,\" Covert said. \"They've been seen as a blight. But what we're seeing now is that doesn't just make low-income people go away.\"Instead, he contends, well-managed RV parks should be reconsidered as part of the region's housing strategy.\"We aren't likely, in the near term, to have enough transitional or interim housing to move everybody indoors,\" he said.San Jose has set aside 128 RV spaces across two lots, offering residents a rent-free place to stay while they work with case managers to secure permanent housing.CNBCUntil more permanent housing comes online, Covert said, cities may have little choice but to treat RVs not as an anomaly, but as part of the housing landscape.For Alvarez, the safe parking site provides stability while she continues searching for an apartment she and her boyfriend can afford — a place she's willing to move into if they can find one.\"I'm hoping I can,\" she said.",

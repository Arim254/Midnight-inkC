    "body": "If you don't have children and don't plan on having any, many of the \"default\" settings of personal finance may not apply to you. You may not, for instance, plan on leaving legacy wealth, as many parents do, and you certainly don't have to worry about paying for a kid's wedding or college education.But who will take care of you or make decisions on your behalf in the event that you can't make them for yourself? For many Americans, the default answer is, \"my kids.\"If something bad happens and you don't have children who will take care of you, things can get complicated quickly, says Maddy Roche, chief growth officer at Childfree Trust, a fiduciary firm specializing in childfree and permanently childless people.\"Think about some of the structures that assume that you have children, whether it be insurance planning, estate planning, medical relationships,\" she says. \"You can't get an elective surgery unless you have an emergency contact. Those are the things that we run up against when time's too late.\"The solution, she says, is to start thinking about these scenarios early. \"As hard as it is to think about the future, one of the best ways to ensure that you'll be respected in the ways that you crave and deserve is to be proactive,\" she says.Be proactive in your planningJust about every financial professional will tell you that everyone — whether you have kids or not — needs some form of an estate plan, which expresses how you'd like medical and financial decisions to be carried out in the event of your death or incapacitation.This becomes even more important for people whose family strays from the norm, Jay Zigmont, a certified financial planner specializing in childfree clients, previously told CNBC Make It.Because health care and government systems look for next-of-kin, there may be no one obvious to contact in the event you get into an accident while out of town, for instance, he says: \"That means the government or health-care system will be making decisions for you.\"To avoid those scenarios, you'll need documents in place, such as powers of attorney and a health-care directive. These documents go by different names in different states, so talk with an attorney about your specific needs, but the gist is that they lay out your wishes and designate a decision-maker for you should you become incapacitated.These wishes could be as consequential as whether or not you want to be on a respirator or as straightforward as what to do with your cats while you're in the hospital.Designate a trusted friend or relativeFor many childfree people, figuring out who will execute your plan comes with some complications. You may, for instance, want to nominate an extended family member to oversee your care — but that could create conflicts of interest if that person stands to inherit your estate.\"Some people feel like they need to offer monetary compensation for these roles. Say, for instance, you have a long-lost nephew,\" she says. \"Are we sure he won't feel conflicted in terms of helping you manage your affairs — that you'll stay in the kind of quality facility you need if he feels his inheritance is on the line?\"In some states, you may be able to hire a fiduciary to execute your estate — someone who is bound by law to act in your best financial interest. For the most part, though, you'll have to cultivate what Roche calls a \"strategic relationship\" with a trusted friend or relative.The key, she says, is to make sure you're on the same page as early as possible.\"You need to start to think about your wishes and make sure they're documented and make sure the people you're nominating really know what you want to happen,\" Roche says. \"Talk with people about what these roles are and what you expect of them. It's all important to be thinking about.\"Want to level up your AI skills? Sign up for Smarter by CNBC Make It's new online course, How To Use AI To Communicate Better At Work.

    "body": "Hundreds of thousands of Americans are reconfiguring their budgets right now.Major employers like Amazon, Target and Nestle have all announced layoffs and the government shutdown is now in its second month. Impacted workers must focus their resources on long-term survival.Tightening budgets could mean the holiday season looks a little bit different this year. And it will be an especially challenging time for parents.\"Children are exceptionally perceptive,\" says Wendell Clarke, an Atlanta-based behavioral wealth specialist.If you're navigating financial hardship, you may be wondering how forthcoming you should be with your kids. In his practice, Clarke helps clients with financial planning, including looking ahead to challenging times.Here's his advice on how much your kids should know.3 tips for talking about financial hardship with your kids1. Be honestTo start, just be honest, Clarke says.If there's going to be very noticeable changes in how you spend money, like not ordering takeout as much or if a parent has been laid off and is spending more time at home, tell them why.\"I wouldn't make it long and complex,\" Clarke says. \"I would create space for them to understand and not understand and to ask questions.\"2. Support them in their emotional journeyWhether they start asking questions immediately or take time to process, make sure to support your kids' emotional response to the situation.\"Remember, they are kids,\" Clarke says. \"They should be allowed to feel and to be reassured.\"If your kid expresses sadness or anger, tell them you understand how they feel and that their emotions are warranted.Most importantly, reassure them that the situation is temporary. \"Kids don't necessarily do well with the indefinite,\" he says.Let them know things will only be different for \"a little while longer.\"3. Model the behavior you want them to exhibitFinally, it's important to model the behavior you want your kids to one day exhibit themselves.For example, if you spend lavishly on clothing, travel, groceries — both in a time of financial strain and when money's not so tight — that's the relationship you're teaching them to have with money.\"Communication is both verbal and non-verbal,\" says Clarke.\"Use experiences to share financial strategies with children so they can learn your money messages and financial values,\" he says.Then show them how you're implementing those very lessons yourself.Want to level up your AI skills? Sign up for Smarter by CNBC Make It's new online course, How To Use AI To Communicate Better At Work.

    "body": "Ford Mustang Mach-E EV vehicles at a Ford dealership in Los Angeles, California, US, on Thursday, Oct 16, 2025. Kyle Grillot | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesDETROIT — Sales of all-electric vehicles collapsed last month following the end of up to $7,500 in federal incentives for purchasing an EV, several automakers said Monday.Ford Motor, Kia and Hyundai Motor reported massive declines in EV sales as many buyers pulled ahead purchases before the credits ended under changes by the Trump administration.Ford, which ranked third in U.S. EV sales through the third quarter, reported a 25% drop in its year-over-year all-electric October sales. That included a 12% drop of its Mustang Mach-E crossover and a 17% fall for the F-150 Lightning.Kia and Hyundai reported their top EV models dropped between 52% and 71% from a year earlier. The declines are notably greater when looking month-to-month, as September marked the end of a record quarter for EV sales in the U.S. ahead of the credits ending.Some models, such as Hyundai's Ioniq 5 and Ioniq 9 EVs, dropped by 80% and 71% from September to October, respectively, according to its reported sales. It was a similar story for similar vehicles at Kia, which is owned by Hyundai Motor but largely operates separately in the U.S.\"We saw strong EV demand leading up to the expiration of federal tax credits, and while that shift has temporarily disrupted the market, we're confident it will reset,\" Hyundai Motor North America CEO Randy Parker said in a release.Meanwhile, sales of hybrid vehicles for carmakers are expected to continue to rise. Sales of such models for each of the automakers were bright spots in October, the companies said.Only a limited number of automakers report monthly sales, rather than quarterly, but the results are an early indication of the expected fall in EV sales following the end of the federal incentives.\"With the credit now off the table, the market appears to be settling into a more natural rhythm,\" Jessica Caldwell, head of insights for CarMax's Edmunds, said in a Monday blog. \"October marks the start of a reset period: one defined less by incentive-driven urgency and more by buyers motivated by genuine interest in EV ownership.\"Ahead of the EV incentives ending, several automotive executives such as Parker and Ford CEO Jim Farley predicted a massive drop off in EV sales.Farley late last month said he \"wouldn't be surprised\" if sales of EVs fell from a market share of around 5% after the end of the incentives from a level of 10% to 12% in September.Tesla, at a 43.1% market share, and General Motors, at 13.8%, led the U.S. automotive industry this year in record domestic sales of all-electric vehicles through the third quarter, according to data provided to CNBC from Motor Intelligence.Cox Automotive's Kelley Blue Book estimates EV sales volume in the U.S. hit an all-time high in the third quarter, reaching 438,487 units sold. That marked a 40.7% jump from the previous quarter and an increase of 29.6% year over year.",

    "body": "Jasondoiy | E+ | Getty ImagesA recent NBC News poll showed growing frustration among Americans regarding President Donald Trump's handling of the economy less than a year after entering office.In a poll of 1,000 voters taken between Oct. 25-28, 63% said Trump had fallen short of expectations regarding the economy. Separately, 65% said Trump had fallen short of looking out for the middle class, and 66% expressed the same sentiment for the handling of inflation and the cost of living.Trump's overall approval rating in the poll has fallen 4 points to 43% since March, while 55% disapprove of the president's job performance.The negativity appears to be bleeding into voters' feelings of dissatisfaction with Republican lawmakers. With just a year to go before the 2026 midterm elections, Democrats are favored to win control of Congress by an 8-point margin, 50% to 42%, among those polled. Democrats led by just one point, 48% to 47%, in the March survey.The results come as the government shutdown has stretched past a month, affecting critical government programs, including SNAP food benefits. The NBC News poll also indicated that voters are split on which party would have a better handle on the economy.According to the poll, 38% of voters found Republicans would do a better job, while 37% found Democrats would be more effective.This follows a recent CNBC All-America Economic Survey, which showed views on the U.S. economy turned more negative.See the complete NBC News poll here.",

    "body": "In this photo illustration, the logo of semiconductor manufacturer Nexperia is displayed on a screen.Vcg | Visual China Group | Getty ImagesShares of Europe's biggest carmakers rose Monday as fears over an industry shortage of semiconductors appeared to recede.China on Saturday said it would consider some exemptions for Nexperia chip exports. It had previously blocked Nexperia semiconductors from leaving the country after the Dutch government seized control of Nexperia, owned by the Chinese company Wingtech.The standoff between the Netherlands and China had prompted automotive groups to raise the alarm over a worsening chip shortage.France's Renault, Germany's Mercedes-Benz Group and Milan-listed shares of Jeep maker Stellantis were all trading up around 3% on Monday morning.Auto parts suppliers Valeo and Aumovio had advanced 3% and 1.6%, respectively, by around 11:30 a.m. London time (6:30 a.m. ET).Germany's Volkswagen, Porsche and BMW were also trading more than 1.3% higher.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconShares of Volkswagen over the last three months compared to other major European automakers.Analysts at Barclays said developments over the weekend appeared to be \"quite positive\" for the automotive sector, with fears of significant disruption likely to be avoided.\"While the Nexperia issue is not fully resolved, with ongoing negotiations between the Dutch and Chinese government to determine a path forward for Nexperia, we believe the potential near-term production headwind has been remediated, although we await more details,\" Dan Levy, senior autos analyst at Barclays, said in a research note published Monday.The situation involving Nexperia began in September, when the Dutch government took control of the company, in what was seen as a highly unusual move, reportedly after the U.S. raised security concerns.In making the decision, the Dutch government cited fears that technology from the company — which specializes in the high-volume production of chips used in automotive, consumer electronics and other industries — \"would become unavailable in an emergency.\"China responded by blocking exports of the firm's finished products.German automakers are thought to be especially sensitive to Nexperia-related disruptions because they rely heavily on large, domestic suppliers, known as \"Tier 1s,\" and local production facilities and companies, such as Nexperia, despite much of its manufacturing moving to China.Japan's Honda Motor became the first known automaker to reduce production due to the problem last week.",

    "body": "Changpeng Zhao, founder of Binance, attends the Viva Technology conference dedicated to innovation and startups at Porte de Versailles exhibition center in Paris on June 16, 2022.Benoit Tessier | ReutersPresident Donald Trump said he knows nothing about Binance founder Changpeng Zhao — or that company's recent involvement in a cryptocurrency venture linked to Trump's family — despite granting him a pardon last month.Asked in a CBS \"60 Minutes\" interview that aired on Sunday why he pardoned the former crypto executive known as CZ, Trump said, \"Okay, are you ready? I don't know who he is.\"In late 2023, Zhao stepped down as CEO of Binance and pleaded guilty to a charge of failing to sufficiently combat money laundering on his crypto exchange. He was sentenced to four months in jail and released in September 2024.Trump suggested that his decision to pardon CZ was motivated by a desire to make the U.S. more globally competitive in the nascent crypto industry. And he accused the government under his predecessor, former President Joe Biden, of waging a \"witch hunt\" against CZ, even as Trump repeatedly denied knowledge of his case.\"My sons are involved in crypto much more than I— me. I— I know very little about it, other than one thing. It's a huge industry,\" he said. \"And if we're not gonna be the head of it, China, Japan, or someplace else is.\"Despite saying he didn't know who CZ is, Trump said Zhao \"was treated really badly by the Biden administration.\" \"They sent him to jail and they really set him up. That's my opinion. I was told about it,\" the president said.\"I don't know the man at all. I don't think I ever met him,\" Trump went on. \"I have no idea who he is. I was told that he was a victim, just like I was and just like many other people, of a vicious, horrible group of people in the Biden administration.\"Trump's claim that he knows nothing about a high-profile clemency recipient comes as he and Republicans have asserted that pardons issued by Biden using an \"autopen\" are invalid because, they argue, the president was not aware of what he was signing.Trump wrote in a Truth Social post in March that many of Biden's pardons are void \"because of the fact that they were done by Autopen. In other words, Joe Biden did not sign them but, more importantly, he did not know anything about them!\"After Republicans on the Oversight Committee issued a report last month on Biden's autopen use, House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., said the former president \"didn't even know what the categories were, apparently, much less the individual people, that he pardoned.\"Binance in 2023 agreed to pay a total of $4.3 billion to settle a multiyear investigation into allegations that the platform's users had made thousands of transactions in support of illicit activities, including terrorism and child abuse.Then-Attorney General Merrick Garland called that fine \"one of the largest corporate penalties in U.S. history.\"Following Trump's election, Zhao mounted an aggressive campaign for clemency, including publicly praising the president and submitting pardon applications, The New York Times reported.Read more CNBC politics coverageShutdown cost government contractors $12B so far: U.S. Chamber of CommerceThe big takeaways from the Trump-Xi meeting — what the truce coversShipping sector skeptical Trump's latest trade truce with China will reverse import declineTrump-Xi meeting nears with high stakes and hopes, but few detailsGovernment shutdown could cost U.S. economy up to $14 billion, CBO saysBinance also recently became financially entangled with World Liberty Financial, a crypto finance platform that sends 75% of token sales revenue to a company linked to Trump and his family.In May, World Liberty co-founder Zach Witkoff — a son of top Trump administration official Steve Witkoff — said that his company's stablecoin would be used to facilitate a $2 billion investment in Binance by Emirati state investment firm MGX.Later that same month, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission said it would drop its case against Binance and Zhao.Trump announced Zhao's pardon on Oct. 23.Trump was asked in Sunday's CBS interview to address \"the appearance of pay for play.\"\"Well, here's the thing, I know nothing about it because I'm too busy,\" Trump said before a moment of crosstalk.\"I can only tell you this. My sons are into it. I'm glad they are, because it's probably a great industry, crypto. I think it's good. You know, they're running a business, they're not in government,\" he said.Returning to CZ, Trump said, \"I know nothing about the guy, other than I hear he was a victim of weaponization by government. When you say the government, you're talking about the Biden government.\"",

Shannon Stapleton | ReutersShares of Beyond Meat fell on Monday after the company delayed its third-quarter financial results.The plant-based meat maker will now report earnings after the market closes on Nov. 11. Beyond Meat said it delayed its results because it needs more time to calculate a material non-cash impairment charge related to certain long-lived assets.Beyond Meat had become a meme stock in October, rising from a sub-$2 price to nearly $8 at one point as traders on Robinhood and other brokerages crowded in to the stock following its addition to the Roundhill Meme Stock ETF and in order to possibly exploit a large short position by hedge funds.The shares were off by more than 11% to $1.47, below its $1.89 close to end September.",

Dmitry Astakhov | Afp | Getty ImagesRussian officials appeared eager Monday to reaffiirm Moscow's alliance with China following U.S. President Donald Trump's high-profile meeting with Xi Jinping.Hot on the heels of Trump's talks with Xi last week, which the U.S. president described as \"amazing,\" Russia has now sent a large delegation of its own to China for deal-making and talks.Russia's Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin arrived in Hangzhou on Monday for two-day talks with his Chinese counterpart, Li Qiang, with the officials signing a range of agreements, Russian state media reported, to deepen cooperation in the fields of trade, investment, energy, transport, agriculture and space.Calling his Chinese counterpart his \"dear friend,\" Mishustin said in comments reported by Russian state news agency Ria Novosti, that relations between Russia and China were \"at their highest level in their centuries-long history and continue to develop dynamically in all areas, despite various obstacles and illegal Western sanctions.\"For his part, Li Qiang said Beijing was ready to strengthen cooperation with Russia despite obstacles, although he did not specify what he was referring to.\"Despite new external risks and challenges in this process, China and Russia always support each other, build strategic contacts and interactions, and strive to jointly overcome difficulties,\" he said, TASS reported. He added that the partnership \"demonstrates that China and Russia are good neighbors and reliable partners who can always trust each other.\"China is Russia's most important and powerful international ally, with Beijing having refused to condemn Moscow's invasion of Ukraine in 2022 and the ongoing war, echoing Russia's rhetoric by calling the war a \"crisis.\"Just ahead of its invasion of Ukraine, Putin and Xi signed a \"no limits\" partnership and Russia has looked to leverage that alliance both in terms of geopolitical support and trade partnerships, to lessen the impact of Western sanctions which have curtailed its energy export market.Chinese President Xi Jinping welcomes Russian President Vladimir Putin during a ceremony at the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit in Tianjin, China August 31, 2025. Alexander Kazakov | Via ReutersAhead of this week's trip, the Kremlin said it placed \"very great\" importance on the talks and it has certainly looked to reflect that in the delegation sent to Asia, with Mishustin accompanied by a range of top officials including his deputies and ministers of finance, agriculture, transport, economic development and trade.Space and nuclear energy officials were also in tow, with the director general of Roscosmos and head of Rosatom joining the delegation.Perfect timing?Russian officials' two-day visit to China comes just days after Trump's high-profile meeting with Chinese President Xi last week in which he said the leaders had reached \"agreement on many issues.\" Xi, meanwhile, said Beijing and Washington should be \"partners and friends.\"In what was widely seen as a \"trade truce\" after months of escalating tensions over tariffs and counter-tariffs, Trump said he reached a 1-year agreement with China on rare earth supplies and he also cut fentanyl-linked tariffs on Beijing by half, taking overall duties on Chinese goods down to 47%.U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping talk as they leave after a bilateral meeting at Gimhae International Airport, on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit, in Busan, South Korea, October 30, 2025. Evelyn Hockstein | ReutersMoscow did not publicly comment on the meeting and was likely uncomfortable at the sight of its longtime ally China holding seemingly constructive (and reconstructive) talks with the U.S., with whom it has seen a sharp deterioration of relations in recent weeks.Trump pulled out of in-person talks that were due to take place with Russian President Vladimir Putin, saying he did not want to \"have a wasted meeting,\" signaling his frustration with Moscow over a lack of movement on the Ukraine war.Trump added that the summit had been canceled because \"every time I speak to Vladimir, I have good conversations and then they don't go anywhere.\"Russia was non-plussed by the cancelation, with senior Russian officials blaming Western media and \"fake news\" for the jettisoned talks.",

Jim Watson | Afp | Getty ImagesDe-escalation in tensions between China and the U.S. after their leaders met in South Korea last Thursday stands in stark contrast to the chill in Washington-New Delhi relations, with India now subject to higher U.S. tariffs than Beijing.Experts said that the strategic relationship between India and U.S. built over two decades has substantially eroded.Atman Trivedi a partner and lead of the South Asia Practice at DGA-Albright Stonebridge Group said trust between the two countries \"could take years rebuild.\"Steep tariffs, $100,000 fee for H1B visas, and U.S. President Donald Trump's repeated claims of having brokered a ceasefire between India and Pakistan are among issues that have led to deterioration of ties between New Delhi and Washington in recent months, according to experts.\"President Trump evidently does not value India as a partner in balancing China as much as the previous presidents,\" said Raymond Vickery Jr., senior associate and chair on India and emerging Asia Economics at Center for Strategic and International Studies.The U.S. foreign policy from President Bill Clinton until recently, including Trump's first term as the president, had consistently valued \"democratic India over autocratic China,\" he said, adding that the approach toward India has now shifted from one of strategic altruism to \"transactionalism.\"Meanwhile, ties between the U.S. and China appear to be on the mend.In a post on Truth Social on Saturday, Trump said \"My G2 meeting President Xi of China was a great one for both of our countries\" adding that it would lead to \"everlasting peace and success.\"  Shortly after, Pete Hegseth, U.S. secretary of defense, said on X that China and the U.S. had agreed to set up \"miliary-to-military channels to deconflict and deescalate\" any problems.Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping reached a trade truce in a high-stakes meeting in South Korea on Thursday which saw Washington cutting tariffs on Beijing related to fentanyl to 10% from 20%, reducing the overall rate on Chinese goods to around 47%.China now pays a lower tariff than India.In August the U.S. imposed 50% tariffs on India including secondary duties of 25% for its purchase of Russian oil. India has called the move \"unfair, unjustified and unreasonable,\" while has called U.S. trade ties with India \"a totally one-sided disaster!\"U.S. President Donald Trump meets with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington, DC, on Feb. 13, 2025.Jim Watson | Afp | Getty Images\"At the leader-level, the chemistry is missing for now, and the impact of this disconnect on the U.S.-India relationship probably cannot be overstated,\" Trivedi added.During his Asia trip last week, while addressing corporate leaders at Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in South Korea, Trump said he threatened India and Pakistan with 250% tariffs unless they stopped hostilities.An attack by militants in the Indian-controlled region of Kashmir in April killed 26 civilians. India accused Pakistan and launched a military strike, resulting in a four-day conflict that threatened to explode into a broader war fueled by decades of tensions between the two countries.\"The strategic relationship between India and the U.S. has been under strain this year not just because of tariffs, but also because of Washington's posture in the conflict with Pakistan and the apparent warming of [U.S.] ties with Pakistan's military,\" said Alexandra Hermann, head of Southeast Asia Research at Oxford Economics.Trump's claims are being picked up by Modi's political opponents including the leader of opposition Rahul Gandhi. Modi is \"scared\" of U.S. President Donald Trump, Gandhi reportedly said on Sunday in a political rally in Bihar.Hermann added that now the challenge for India would be to find its position between two economic superpowers.\"While New Delhi stands to benefit from greater access to U.S. demand, its dependence on China is unlikely to diminish in the near term given the still-extreme uncertainty around trade policy and the costs of relocating supply chains,\" she said.Keeping aside strained trade ties, U.S. and India on Friday signed a 10-year \"Framework for the US-India Major Defence Partnership.\"Hegseth said on X that the two countries were improving \"coordination, info sharing, and tech cooperation,\" while his Indian counter Rajnath Singh said the partnership between U.S. and India was \"critical for ensuring a free, open and rules-based Indo-Pacific region.\"Experts warn if U.S. sticks with its transactional approach toward India, it will drive the two further apart, compromising strategic interests of both.\"The Trump policy will push India further toward Russia, the Global South, and even China. This will not be in the interests of either India or the US,\" said Vickery Jr. from CSIS.",

    "body": "A person walks down a street with shopping bags in New York City on Nov. 29, 2024.David Dee Delgado | Getty ImagesAmerican consumer wallets will be billions of dollars lighter this holiday season because of President Donald Trump's tariffs, according to LendingTree.Sunday marked six months since Trump announced his broad \"liberation day\" tariffs.Prices for select food and consumer goods rose in the wake of that announcement.And consumers are set to see more of the impact from those tariffs as holiday items that have been stored in warehouses for months are finally hitting store shelves.LendingTree, which operates on an online lending marketplace, used 2024 winter holiday spending data as a reference point for its analysis of the upcoming season.The company estimated that the new tariffs will increase total holiday costs for consumers and retailers by a total of $40.6 billion.Consumers will be on the hook for most of the extra costs from tariffs, an estimated $28.6 billion.That translates to around $132 per shopper.Retailers are expected to eat the remaining $12 billion in extra costs from the tariffs.\"For most Americans, spending an extra $132 at the holidays is significant,\" said Matt Schulz, LendingTree's chief consumer finance analyst.\"While it may not be earth-shattering, it can have a real impact on many families. It could prompt people to cut back on gift-giving this year or lead to them taking on extra debt,\" Schulz said.\"That's a choice no one wants to have to make.\"Retail analysts have told CNBC that retailers expect consumers to buy fewer items this holiday season due to higher costs from tariffs.Schultz agreed, calling it an \"unfortunate reality\" that many consumers will have to face.\"That might mean giving fewer of those items as gifts, or it could mean having to suck up the higher costs to give your loved ones what they want,\" Schulz said.\"I doubt that we'll see a huge drop-off in the amount of electronics and clothes that are gifted this year, simply because they're what so many people want,\" he said. \"However, for some, higher prices may leave them no choice.\"LendingTree estimated that buyers of holiday electronics will see the biggest hit from the tariffs, with an average extra cost of $186 per shopper.Clothing or accessories have the next highest added cost, at $82 per shopper, the company said.Buyers of personal care items, beauty products, and toys will pay $14 more per shopper, and food and candy will cost $12 more per buyer as a result of the tariffs.",

But Musk is again promising that a new one is on the way.In a discussion with podcaster Joe Rogan that was published on Friday, Musk was asked about the long-delayed vehicle. He provided a sense of timing but declined to share updated technical or design details.\"I can't do the unveil before the unveil,\" Musk said. As he's said before, Musk claimed the new Roadster \"has a shot at being the most memorable product unveil ever.\"Tesla is aiming to show off the updated Roadster to fans and investors \"hopefully before the end of the year,\" Musk said.Musk's comments come a day after former close friend Sam Altman, OpenAI's CEO, posted on X that he tried to cancel his Roadster reservation from 2018 and get his deposit refunded. He shared a screenshot showing that his email to the company had bounced back.\"I really was excited for the car!\" Altman wrote. \"And I understand delays. But 7.5 years has felt like a long time to wait.\"Musk, who helped start OpenAI in 2015, is in a heated legal dispute with Altman and now runs competing artificial intelligence startup xAI.Patrick George, editor-in-chief at InsideEVs and a long-time industry observer, told CNBC on Friday that the Roadster \"has been MIA for years.\"\"The only thing I can think of that would make Musk start talking about this again is that Sam Altman at OpenAI, who is sort of his arch-rival, just said recently that he was trying to cancel his Roadster reservation which he has held since 2018,\" George said.Earlier this year, the popular gadget and autos reviewer Marques Brownlee discussed the arduous process of cancelling his own Roadster reservation in an interview with Waveform Podcast.The Roadster is a high end, low-volume model, something meant to challenge vehicles like BYD's YangWang U9 Xtreme, which was recently crowned the world's fastest production car.Musk faces a major Tesla shareholder vote next week, as he and the board are asking investors to approve a massive pay package.The pay plan would net Musk nearly $1 trillion in Tesla stock and would grow his stake to around 25%, depending on the company hitting various market valuations and other growth milestones.WATCH: CNBC's interview with Tesla Chair Robyn Denholmwatch now",

Trump said the tariffs on those countries were for not stopping the flow of that deadly drug into the United States.Trump had invoked the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to impose the tariffs.On Sunday, Trump wrote, \"If a President is not allowed to use Tariffs, we will be at a major disadvantage against all other Countries throughout the World, especially the 'Majors.' \"\"In a true sense, we would be defenseless,\" he said.watch now",

    "body": "MongoDB CEO Dev Ittycheria arrives at the Allen & Co. Media and Technology Conference in Sun Valley, Idaho, on July 9, 2025.David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesDatabase software maker MongoDB said on Monday that CEO Dev Ittycheria is stepping down from the top job after an 11-year run. Chirantan \"CJ\" Desai, who has spent the past year as president of product and engineering at Cloudflare, is replacing Ittycheria, effective Nov. 10, MongoDB said. Ittycheria will remain on the company's board. \"Earlier this year, I would say as part of our normal succession planning process, the board asked me about my long-term plans and whether I could commit for another five years as CEO,\" Ittycheria told CNBC in an interview. \"I thought long and hard about it, and I talked to my family, I talked to the board and ultimately realized I couldn't make that kind of decision.\"Before joining MongoDB, Ittycheria was president of BMC, which bought his company BladeLogic for $854 million in 2008. As BladeLogic's co-founder and CEO, Ittycheria took the company public in 2007. He's also been an investor at venture firms OpenView and Greylock.Ittycheria led MongoDB's IPO in 2017, three years after taking the helm. The company won over individual software developers thanks to its database's architecture that could store a variety of data in documents, challenging market incumbents like Oracle.Under Ittycheria, the company prioritized cloud subscriptions, landed multi-year deals, partnered with rival cloud providers Amazon and Microsoft and expanded the software's capabilities into generative artificial intelligence. MongoDB's stock closed on Friday at $359.82, representing a fifteenfold gain since the IPO and lifting the company's market cap to almost $30 billion. MongoDB's net loss in the July quarter narrowed to $47 million from $54.5 million a year earlier, while revenue rose 24% to $591 million.Cloudflare said in a filing on Thursday that Desai would step down on Nov. 7, to become CEO \"at another notable, publicly-traded company.\" Desai previously served as operating chief at ServiceNow. He resigned in July 2024, after the software company found a policy violation with the hiring of the U.S. Army's chief information officer. Previously Desai held leadership positions at EMC and Symantec.\"We talked to people close to ServiceNow, as well as other people who know CJ really well, and we felt very, very comfortable that CJ is the right person to lead MongoDB in this next era,\" Ittycheria said.Desai, whose first job out of college was at Oracle, said he will split his time between New York and the San Francisco area. MongoDB also said it expects to exceed the high end of its guidance ranges for revenue and adjusted earnings per share in the fiscal third quarter. The top end of its range was 79 cents per share in earnings, and $592 million in revenue.Desai said he's \"looking forward to grow MongoDB to $5 billion-plus in a durable, profitable way, in revenues, and most importantly, to be the gold standard for modern database technology, no matter what kind of workloads exist.\" He did not offer a timeline for the revenue goal.Executives will discuss the leadership change on a conference call with analysts at 10 a.m. ET.WATCH: MongoDB CEO Dev Ittycheria on Q2 results: The opportunity in front of us is massivewatch now",

    "body": "Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella speaks during an event commemorating the 50th anniversary of the company at Microsoft headquarters in Redmond, Washington, on April 4, 2025. Microsoft Corp., determined to hold its ground in artificial intelligence, will soon let consumers tailor the Copilot digital assistant to their own needs.David Ryder | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesMicrosoft will expand its employee base once again, CEO Satya Nadella told investor Brad Gerstner on a podcast that aired on Friday.The software maker's workforce didn't budge in the 2025 fiscal year, which ended in June. It stood at 228,000, with multiple rounds of layoffs lowering the total number by at least 6,000. In July, Microsoft let go of another 9,000 workers.\"I will say we will grow our headcount, but the way I look at it is, that headcount we grow will grow with a lot more leverage than the headcount we had pre-AI,\" Nadella said on the BG2 podcast. OpenAI, which has a broad partnership with Microsoft, introduced its ChatGPT assistant in 2022. Microsoft's headcount grew by 22% in the 2022 fiscal year.Employees will figure out how to do their jobs differently, Nadella said, adding that the company wants to ensure they can access artificial intelligence features in Microsoft 365 productivity software and the GitHub Copilot AI coding assistant. Those services draw on AI models from Anthropic and OpenAI.\"It's the unlearning and learning process that I think will take the next year or so, then the headcount growth will come with max leverage,\" he said.A similar adjustment played out at corporations decades ago, Nadella said. To prepare forecasts, inter-office memos would circulate across multiple sites by fax, and then came email and Excel spreadsheets, he said.\"Right now, any planning, any execution, starts with AI. You research with AI, you think with AI, you share with your colleagues and what have you,\" Nadella said.This week, Amazon, which is racing against Microsoft to rent out cloud infrastructure for running AI models, cut 14,000 corporate employees.Amazon's senior vice president of people experience and technology, Beth Galetti, told workers in a memo that \"this generation of AI is the most transformative technology we've seen since the Internet, and it's enabling companies to innovate much faster than ever before (in existing market segments and altogether new ones).\"On the podcast, Nadella talked about a Microsoft executive who deals with networking fiber. As the company ramped up data center operations to meet rising cloud demand, the executive realized she wouldn't be able to hire all the people she thought she needed, and so she built AI agents to handle maintenance, Nadella said.\"That is an example of you, to your point, a team with AI tools being able to get more productivity,\" Nadella told Gerstner, who is founder and CEO of technology investment firm Altimeter Capital.On Wednesday, Microsoft reported 12% year-over-year revenue growth and showed the widest operating margin since 2002.WATCH: Microsoft earnings beat estimates, Azure revenue jumps 40%watch now",

    "body": "Automaker Stellantis is making $13 billion bet on a U.S. comeback, after a rough 2024 and a $2.7 billion net loss in the first half of 2025.High prices and stale products scuttled what had been a highly successful first few years of the combined company. Stellantis was the product of a merger of French company Peugeot and Italian American company Fiat-Chrysler. Joining forces allowed the automakers to save more than $8 billion through sharing parts and streamlining operations, roughly double what the deal had promised investors.Pandemic-era shortages also allowed Stellantis raise prices on the vehicles it could sell when inventories were tight. The result was three years of growing profits — from $15.4 billion in 2021 to $20 billion in 2023.But even though inventory shortages across the industry kept sales strong, many of the core buyers of Jeep, Ram, Dodge and Chrysler were turning away.\"A lot of automakers during the pandemic really raised pricing,\" said Tom Narayan, lead equity analyst at RBC Capital. \"But they [Stellantis] actually were among the worst offenders.\"During that time, Stellantis was losing market share — dropping about 5% U.S. market share in about five years, according to Autoforecast Solutions.Stellantis has a new plan that aims to recapture its previous status with its $13 billion investment.About a tenth of that is so far dedicated to tooling up U.S. factories for new and existing models. That's also a sign that the company is trying to escape costs associated with tariffs on imported vehicles, experts said. Stellantis earlier this year said trade barriers stand to cost it $1.7 billion in 2025.Watch the video to learn more.",

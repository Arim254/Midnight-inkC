    "body": "watch nowFanDuel parent Flutter Entertainment announced fourth-quarter earnings Thursday that missed Wall Street expectations on nearly every metric. FanDuel's performance in the final quarter of 2025 was affected by bettors losing more often than usual.  When that happens, gamblers get discouraged, bet less and stop using the app as frequently, Flutter CEO Peter Jackson told CNBC in an interview.\"It's fair to say, not everything went our way in the fourth quarter,\" Jackson said. Shares of Flutter fell almost 7% in extended trading Thursday. Here's what the company reported for the fourth quarter, compared with Wall Street consensus: Revenue: $4.74 billion vs. $4.97 billion, according to LSEGAdjusted EPS: $1.74 vs. $1.95, according to LSEGFor the fourth quarter, Flutter reported adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization of $832 million, below the $893 million that Wall Street was expecting, according to StreetAccount. Its fourth-quarter revenue marked a year-over-year increase of 25%. And yet, Flutter's 2026 revenue guidance of $17.75 billion to $19.05 billion was lower than analysts' projection of $19.34 billion for the year. On the company's earnings call, Jackson told investors that prediction markets would likely spur more legalization of sports betting by the states. He also said the company has found no evidence that prediction markets are cannibalizing the sportsbook business. ",

The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said in a short statement on Friday that a truce had taken effect in southern Ukraine to enable the restoration of the 330-kilovolt supply line to Europe's largest nuclear power plant.\"Demining activities are ongoing to ensure safe access for the repair teams,\" IAEA Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi said on social media.The local ceasefire, which the IAEA said it had helped to secure, comes shortly after the fourth anniversary of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine.Russian forces have controlled the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant since the first few weeks of the invasion. Situated in the southeast of the country, the plant is Ukraine's largest and houses six of its 15 operational nuclear power reactors. It has recently been reliant on external power to sustain all essential nuclear safety functions. Both sides have accused each other of raising the risk of a catastrophic accident by staging attacks near to the plant.Russian nuclear power company Rosatom said on Friday that IAEA specialists located at the power plant were monitoring repairs to disconnected power line, according to state news outlet RIA Novosti.Ukraine's Foreign Ministry had not responded to CNBC's request for comment as this article went live.View of Zaporizhzhya Nuclear Power Plant from right bank of Dnipro river. At the moment the left bank of the Dnipro River is occupied by Russian forces including the nuclear plant.Pacific Press | Lightrocket | Getty ImagesEarlier this month, the IAEA warned the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant was operating on its last remaining power line, reportedly as a result of military activity near the switchyard operated by the Zaporizhzhia thermal power plant.Analysts at the Institute for the Study of War think tank said Tuesday that the fifth year of Russia's war hadn't started well for President Vladimir Putin, noting Ukrainian forces have recently made the most significant gains on the battlefield since the country's incursion into Russia's Kursk Oblast in August 2024.",

    "body": "Jonathan Raa | Nurphoto | Getty ImagesIn a week where the News Gods have given us a cornucopia of stories, it's a fool's game to pick out the biggest one.Was it Trump's extraordinary State of The Union? The phenomenal Nvidia results that failed to answer questions over whether the enormous hyperscaler splurge will result in significant profits further down the line? The rising tensions between Iran and the U.S.?Let me play the fool for a moment, because I think the news from a medium-sized tech payments company might have longer term tremors and be a warning of societal upheaval far greater than other stories of the week.Block, a $33 billion company, surged in extended trading on Thursday after cofounder and CEO Jack Dorsey, best known for cofounding Twitter, told the market he is laying off nearly half his workforce.He wrote to shareholders that 4,000 of the 10,000 were \"being asked to leave or entering into consultation\" to leave. Again: That is nearly half his workforce!Block CFO Amrita Ahuja said the job cuts would position the company \"for our next phase of long term growth.\"\"We are choosing to shift how we operate at a time when our business is accelerating and we see an opportunity to move faster with smaller, highly talented teams using AI to automate more work,\" Ahuja wrote.Job cuts happen all the time, but what Dorsey had to say should be a wake-up call for everyone.He said he expects other companies to similarly overhaul their workforces as they see more efficiency gains from \"intelligence tools.\"Let that sink in: Dorsey expects other companies to similarly overhaul their workforces as they see more efficiency gains from \"intelligence tools.\"\"Within the next year, I believe the majority of companies will reach the same conclusion and make similar structural changes,\" he wrote.Do the math: 10,000 jobs to just under 6,000 replicated across industries across the nation, across the world.So a new, growth company, not an old economy business, has just said companies will cut huge swathes of their workforces as new intelligence tools become diffuse.I keep getting told on CNBC that AI will create new jobs to replace those being lost. I've been asking the same question for years now. \"What are those jobs? Where are the mass of jobs for the millions whose roles are set to be made redundant?\" And I hear the same old trope every time – \"oh those jobs haven't been created yet.\"I think it's time we got a better answer, no?",

Retail is not behind the selling that led to a lackluster reaction to the blockbuster results, Patel said.There's a caveat: Patel said there's strong selling in addition to buying in the chipmaker. That can help explain the stock's rocky action in morning trading, he added.\"Flows have been two-way,\" Patel wrote in a Thursday note. \"Total retail turnover in [Nvidia] has been pretty epic too at the start of the session.\"Thursday's action comes on the heels of the AI darling's earnings, which beat analyst expectations and came with strong guidance. Nvidia also reported 75% revenue growth in its core data center business, which helped drive the company's overall sales up 73%.Despite trading modestly higher before the bell, shares were lower by more than 4% in midday trading.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconNvidia, 1-day chartBroadcom, the iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF (IGV) and the iShares Semiconductor ETF (SOXX) have seen \"spillover buying\" as retail investors up their activity more broadly, Patel said.\"If this continues, then we may be on track for one of the biggest days of retail buying of single stocks in months, which matters a lot for the overall risk view,\" Patel said.To be sure, everyday traders were relatively reserved heading into Nvidia's report. Average daily net flow over the five-day window ahead of the release was $94 million, around half of what was seen in the runup to the prior report, Vanda said Wednesday.Nvidia has been a top stock for retail investors since 2023, Vanda data shows. Despite Thursday's slide, Wall Street is bullish on the path ahead: The typical analyst polled by LSEG has a buy rating and price target suggesting shares can jump more than 35% over the next 12 months.",

Cuba's coast guard said on February 25, 2026, it shot dead four people and wounded six others traveling in a US-registered speedboat during an exchange of fire near Cuba's shores that came amid heightened tensions with Washington.Adalberto Roque | Afp | Getty ImagesThe Kremlin on Thursday said that the situation in fuel-starved Cuba is intensifying after a deadly incident with a U.S.-registered speedboat off the coast of the Caribbean island. \"We see that the situation around Cuba is escalating,\" Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters, according to Russian state news outlet RIA Novosti.\"The most important thing is the humanitarian component. Of course, the humanitarian issues of Cuban citizens must be resolved, and no one should create obstacles,\" Peskov said. The comments come shortly after Cuba's Interior Ministry said border guards killed four exiles and wounded six others onboard a Florida-tagged speedboat that entered its territorial waters. The 10 passengers of the vessel were said to have opened fire on a Cuban patrol off the northern coast of the island. The individuals, all of whom were Cuban nationals residing in the U.S., were armed and some had previous criminal records, Cuba's Interior Ministry said. It added that assault rifles, handguns, improvised explosive devices and camouflage uniforms were among the items seized from the boat.U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio described the incident as \"highly unusual\" and said the White House would \"respond appropriately\" once it had conducted an independent investigation.

The Trump administration has effectively cut Cuba off from Venezuelan oil since launching a military operation to seize Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro on Jan. 3. Cuba said 32 of its citizens were killed in the attack.U.S. President Donald Trump has since said Cuba's government poses \"an unusual and extraordinary threat\" and pledged to impose tariffs on any country that supplies it with oil.

    "body": "A sign of Swiss pharmaceutical giant Novartis is seen on the top of a building in Basel, Switzerland, Sept. 9, 2025.Fabrice Coffrini | AFP | Getty ImagesNovartis, one of the world's largest pharmaceutical companies, and Genentech, a major biotech firm, say they've uncovered a \"dangerous scheme\" to import their allergy medication from Canada into the U.S. in violation of U.S. Food and Drug Administration regulations.Both are suing SHARx — a so-called alternative funding program — and a Canadian pharmacy over the importation of Xolair, an injectable prescription medication for patients with severe asthma, food allergies and respiratory conditions, to an allergy and asthma center in Michigan.\"Biological medicines, like the U.S. Xolair medicine, require particular care because their complex composition and sensitivity to variation in storage and handling conditions are susceptible to contamination and degradation that could undermine their safety and efficacy,\" according to the lawsuit, filed on Feb. 2 in U.S. District Court in Michigan.The suit said the scheme circumvents FDA regulations that generally prohibit importation of unapproved medications from overseas. The plaintiffs are asking the court to stop the importation of the drug. The lawsuit comes on the heels of a CNBC investigation that revealed a growing class of businesses called alternative funding programs, or AFPs, which promise to connect patients with more affordable options for accessing medications that often come at very high costs. The AFPs are able to obtain the overseas drugs at a substantially reduced price.Federal authorities told CNBC last year that importing medications from foreign markets is illegal and could pose risks to patients' health.watch nowAFPs contract with employer-sponsored health plans to offer coverage on specialty drugs. They often work with private employers, school districts, local governments and unions.CNBC's investigation revealed that in at least one case, an employer required its staff to obtain their high-cost medication through SHARx or said it wouldn't be covered. SHARx last year defended its business model, telling CNBC it provides an alternative to expensive drugs in the U.S. SHARx, which is based in St. Louis, Missouri, did not respond to CNBC's request for comment about the lawsuit.According to the complaint, the shipment of Xolair to the Michigan allergy center came from Campbell Heights Pharmacy in British Columbia, Canada. The pharmacy also did not respond to a request for comment.The suit said SHARx \"continues to brazenly deceive patients into believing they are receiving the same safe, securely supplied medicines that they would receive from a U.S. retail pharmacy.\"The drug has strict shipping and temperature controls, the suit said.Drugs not approved for the U.S. market that are shipped from overseas can result in contamination, potentially leading to \"serious patient injury and even death,\" the suit said.A separate lawsuit, filed in late 2024 by Gilead Sciences, similarly alleges that other alternative funding programs illegally import medications. The AFPs in the case, which is pending, have denied any wrongdoing.",

    "body": "watch nowState Farm on Thursday announced a historic $5 billion dividend for its car insurance members, the largest in the mutual insurance company's 103-year history. \"This dividend is possible due to State Farm Mutual's financial strength and a stronger than expected underwriting performance, which has been reported industry wide,\" the company said in a statement. Customers can expect to receive refunds of $100 on average, though State Farm says the amount will vary by state and by the amount of premium paid. State Farm reports it has also lowered premiums by about 10% across 40 states, totaling $4.6 billion in cost savings for customers.That's a trend across the motor vehicle insurance industry. Auto repair costs are starting to decline, and the frequency of accidents declined in 2025. But car insurance premiums have soared. By early 2025, rates had climbed by more than 50% over three years, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the highest inflation for motor vehicle insurance in 50 years.Affordability became a primary concern for many customers and led them to shop around for better deals. TransUnion recently issued a report showing insurance shopping has become a routine activity for consumers, rather than a rare event prompted by a car or home purchase.\"At this point we can safely say that regular insurance shopping is just the new normal,\" Patrick Foy, the senior director of strategic planning for TransUnion's insurance business, told CNBC in an interview. The report noted that the main drivers behind the rate shopping are economic pressures pushing consumers to find ways to reduce household expenses. At the same time, insurers are investing heavily in marketing and setting competitive rates.Travelers, Berkshire Hathaway's Geico, Root and Chubb compete with State Farm and USAA and other mutuals, where customers are also shareholders.Progressive in particular has been pressuring State Farm's dominance in auto and was among major auto insurers announcing significant financial returns to customers in 2025. The company paid $1 billion in dividends to its customers in Florida, where state laws require insurers to return excess profits. USAA announced a $3.8 billion payout to its members across states in 2025. The auto insurance business represents 63% of State Farm's property and casualty insurance business. Customer loyalty in auto insurance often leads to loyalty in homeowner's insurance too, where State Farm told CNBC it is not seeing its claims costs subsiding and it's still working to charge adequate rates to compensate.

    "body": "Students are seen on the campus of Columbia University in New York City on April 14, 2025.Charly Triballeau | AFP | Getty ImagesFederal authorities released Columbia University student Elmina Aghayeva on Thursday afternoon, hours after Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents entered a university residential hall in New York City and took the native of Azerbaijan into custody, the school said.New York Mayor Zohran Mamdani earlier said President Donald Trump had called to tell him that Aghayeva would be released following a meeting at the White House, where the mayor had urged the president to set her free.Aghayeva was arrested by ICE agents at around 6:30 a.m. in Manhattan.Columbia University's acting president, Claire Shipman, accused ICE of entering university property under false pretenses.\"Our understanding at this time is that the federal agents made misrepresentations to gain entry to the building to search for a 'missing person,' \" and then detained Aghayeva, Shipman said in an email obtained by CNBC.All law enforcement agents require a judicial warrant or subpoena to enter housing and other non-public campus areas, Shipman said in the email. Agents looking to enter private campus spaces should wait until the school's public safety team has been contacted, she added.Manhattan Borough President Brad Hoylman-Sigal, in an X post, said that ICE \"used a phony missing persons bulletin\" about a 5-year-old girl.\"They purposefully deceived campus housing/security to gain entry to the student's apartment,\" Hoylman-Sigal wrote. \"The level of civil rights violations that took place is staggering.\"The federal agents identified themselves as police looking for a missing child when entering the building, Shipman alleged in a separate email to the campus community Thursday night. Camera footage showed agents in the hallway sharing pictures of the purported child, she added.Shipman added that federal agents did not produce a warrant despite repeated requests from a Columbia University public safety officer. They also refused to allow the officer to call his boss, Shipman added.\"This was a frightening and fast-moving situation and utterly unacceptable for our students and staff,\" Shipman said in the email.A Department of Homeland Security official told CNBC that ICE agents arrested Aghayeva, whose student visa was terminated by the Obama administration in 2016, after \"the building manager and her roommate let officers into the apartment.\"\"She has no pending appeals or applications with DHS,\" said the official, whose agency oversees ICE.The incident comes as Trump's focus on immigration has become a national flashpoint.Border czar Tom Homan earlier this month said the administration would wind down its immigration enforcement surge in Minnesota, an operation that sent thousands of agents to the Minneapolis area. Two U.S. citizens were killed by immigration officials this year in Minnesota, sparking backlash against the White House's efforts.Columbia has been in the Trump administration's crosshairs since the president returned to office last year.The Education Department in June said the Ivy League school did not meet its accreditation standards because it was \"in violation of federal antidiscrimination laws.\" A month later, Columbia said it would pay $200 million to the federal government to restore its funding that the Trump administration cut.Columbia student Mahmoud Khalil was released in June after three months in ICE detention.",

    "body": "The US Court of International Trade in New York, US, on Thursday, April 24, 2025. Bloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesThe Trump administration's Department of Justice is nearing its first big legal deadline in the wake of the U.S. Supreme Court ruling that President Donald Trump's tariffs issued under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act are illegal.The DOJ needs to weigh in by Friday on one of the first legal fights over refunds in which plaintiffs are asking for expedited payment of tariff refunds through the Court of International Trade (CIT), which has typically handled tariff cases.Trade attorneys have told CNBC there are upwards of 2,000 cases that have been filed by companies suing for tariff refunds at the CIT. Back in December, the CIT put a stay on the cases until after the Supreme Court announced its decision.After the Supreme Court ruling, one of the plaintiffs, V.O.S., filed a motion for its case, which was in federal appeals court pending the Supreme Court decision, to be moved as soon as possible through the Court of International Trade for refund payment. The federal district court sent a motion to the Department of Justice, asking for the DOJ to respond on or before February 27 to allow the case to go back to the CIT for its ruling. As of Thursday afternoon, there had been no filing by the DOJ. It did not respond to CNBC's request for comment.The Supreme Court gave the government court system 32 days to decide on next steps after its ruling.  While the case only covers one group of small businesses, it has legal implications for many cases, the plaintiffs said in their filing: \"This Court's prompt action in this case will facilitate the prompt payment of refunds to the numerous other plaintiffs that have filed and will file IEEPA tariff challenges in this Court. ... the refund process in this case can be used as a template for providing swift relief in those other actions as well.\"Trade attorneys and customs experts tell CNBC approximately 300,000 shippers have paid the tariffs and by some estimates there is as much as $175 billion in potential refunds. More companies have sued in the wake of the Supreme court decision, including a case filed last week by FedEx after the Supreme Court ruling. The DOJ response to the court request may begin to reveal how the Trump administration plans to navigate the refund process. President Trump said at a press conference last Friday that it could take years to litigate the tariff refund issue. Democrats on Capitol Hill have been pressing for a plan from the administration to repay the tariffs since last Friday, citing the fact that it had months to prepare for an adverse ruling. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said in an interview last Friday on Fox News it \"could take years to litigate and get to a payout. If there is a payout, it looks like it's just going to be the ultimate corporate welfare.\"The plaintiffs state in their motion that they want to require the government to issue the administrative orders necessary to \"promptly effectuate the invalidation of the IEEPA tariffs — including any administrative orders necessary to ensure that Plaintiffs swiftly receive the refunds, with interest, that the government has committed to provide.\"While the motion says the plaintiffs do not expect the government to oppose the court, \"the Administration's recent public statements suggest that injunctive relief from this Court will be necessary to ensure the government promptly adheres to its commitments to pay.\"Trade experts have said that while the Court decision did not specifically weigh in on the tariff process — it was only Justice Brett Kavanaugh in his dissent who said it could be a \"mess\" — refunds are due to companies.\"It is clear that the importers of record that paid the unlawful tariffs are entitled to the amounts they paid,\" said Pratik A. Shah, lead attorney for Learning Resources Supreme Court Case and head of the Supreme Court practice at Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld. \"There is no doubt that people that paid the IEEPA tariffs should get refunds. The only question is the process by which refunds will be made.\"watch now",

The 10-year gilt yield stood at 4.267% on Friday morning, while the 30-year gilt yield was last seen at 5.069%.Spencer, a 34-year-old plumber and plasterer, becomes the fifth sitting Green lawmaker in Britain's 650-seat House of Commons.watch now\"Instead of working for a nice life, we're working to line the pockets of billionaires. We are being bled dry and I don't think it is extreme or radical to think working hard should get you a nice life,\" she said in her victory speech.Labour won the Gorton and Denton seat with almost 51% of the vote at the national general election in July 2024, when Starmer swept to power and ousted the Conservative Party after 14 years in office.In an interview with broadcasters, Starmer described the result as \"very disappointing\" and said he understood that voters were \"frustrated\" and \"impatient for change.\"The change in fortunes for the ruling party appears to suggest that voters could be willing to look beyond the main parties of Labour and the Conservatives, or Tories, to more alternative parties such as the Greens and Reform UK in the wider local elections in May.watch nowJohn Curtice, a prominent political scientist and professor of politics at the U.K.'s University of Strathclyde, said the result shows the two main parties are being challenged.\"We are getting an unprecedented challenge by Reform, as it were from the right, stroke the more socially conservative end of Britain, challenging the Conservative party. And now, the Greens apparently now serious competitors with Labour for voters on the left and those of a more social liberal disposition,\" Curtice told CNBC's \"Squawk Box Europe\" on Friday.\"Historically, in Britain, we've said elections are won and lost on the center ground. That's not what is happening at the moment,\" he added.'Energy boost'\"The Green Party will be absolutely cock-a-hoop,\" Damian Lyons Lowe, CEO of London-based polling company Survation, told CNBC's \"Europe Early Edition\" on Friday.  watch now\"I think people looking forward now to the local elections, certainly this is a really, kind of, energy boost for the Green Party because the wasted vote argument that is normally the curse of the Green Party — that a vote for the Greens is just letting Reform in, for example, or the Tories in,\" Lowe said.\"Those voters will feel energized and I think the Greens will do better than they would have done otherwise in the local elections in May,\" he added.",

Kevin Dietsch | Getty ImagesCongressional Democrats will force a vote on a war powers resolution relating to Iran next week, Democratic leadership announced Thursday, as President Donald Trump engages in a massive military buildup in the region. The resolution would limit Trump's ability to conduct military action there.Reps. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., and Thomas Massie, R-Ky., have introduced a measure known as a war powers resolution that would compel the administration to seek congressional approval before engaging in any further activity in Iran. Congress has the sole authority to declare war under the U.S. Constitution, though that authority has been stretched in recent years by the executive branch. \"As soon as Congress reconvenes next week, we will compel a vote of the full House of Representatives on the bipartisan Khanna-Massie War Powers resolution,\" the Democratic leaders led by House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., said in a statement. \"The Iranian regime is brutal and destabilizing, seen most recently in the killing of thousands of protestors,\" the statement read. \"However, undertaking a war of choice in the Middle East, without a full understanding of all the attendant risks to our servicemembers and to escalation, is reckless.\"The war powers resolution would also need to be approved by the Senate if it is passed by the House. But passage from the House is far from a guaranteed outcome as bipartisan lawmakers have recently lined up against the resolution. Reps. Mike Lawler, R-N.Y., and Josh Gottheimer, D-N.J., released a statement last week opposing the measure, citing concerns about Iran's nuclear and ballistic missile capabilities.\"We respect and defend Congress's constitutional role in matters of war. Oversight and debate are absolutely vital,\" the pair wrote. \"However, this resolution would restrict the flexibility needed to respond to real and evolving threats and risks, signaling weakness at a dangerous moment.\"Trump has overseen a massive military buildup in the Middle East and has threatened strikes against Iran. His administration is also negotiating with Tehran over the country's nuclear program. The two countries held a third round of talks in Geneva on Thursday.Omani Foreign Minister Badr Albusaidi in a post on X described the day's negotiations as having made \"significant progress.\" He said that technical discussions will continue next week in Vienna and that the principals would reconvene \"soon after consultation in the respective capitals.\"The president said during his State of the Union address Tuesday that he prefers to resolve the Iran situation diplomatically but did not take military force off the table. \"I will never allow the world's No. 1 sponsor of terror, which they are by far, to have a nuclear weapon,\" Trump said.

    "body": "MP Materials 10X Magnet Manufacturing Facility, Northlake TX.Source: MP MaterialsMP Materials has chosen Northlake, Texas, for its new $1.25 billion rare earth magnet manufacturing campus, the company announced Thursday, amid a rush to shore up domestic supplies of metals critical for everything from data centers and defense to personal electronics.The facility, dubbed \"10X,\" will use rare earth raw materials that have been sourced and processed at MP Materials' Mountain Pass mine in California. Mountain Pass is the only commercial-scale rare earths mine in the U.S.Once operational, 10X will produce about 7,000 metric tons of rare earth magnets annually, bringing the company's total production to 10,000 metric tons per year.The company has another magnet facility in Forth Worth, Texas, which started commercial production in 2025. Total capacity is about 3,000 tons per year, with customers including General Motors and Apple.China dominates critical minerals supply chains – including for rare earths, controlling more than 90% of processing, separation capacity, and magnet manufacturing. Last year the nation weaponized rare earths by curbing exports, shining a spotlight on chokepoints within the critical minerals supply chain.watch nowU.S. imports of rare earth magnets fell to about 6,000 tons in 2025 amid export controls. MP Materials' new factory could end direct import dependence. However, when including imports of end products that use rare earths magnets – including cars and phones – U.S. demand is significantly higher.The Trump administration has announced a host of initiatives aimed at boosting domestic mining. Last year, the Defense Department took a $400 million stake in MP Materials, while also guaranteeing a minimum price of $110 per kilogram for 10 years for neodymium-praseodymium oxide, which is used to make magnets. All of 10X's output is currently committed to the Pentagon for 10 years as part of the previously announced deal. That said, there is opportunity for commercial customers to use the material with the DOD's agreement.\"We are advancing key objectives under our public-private partnership with the Department of War and accelerating America's rare earth and magnet independence with an uncompromising focus on speed, execution, and delivery,\" said MP Materials founder and CEO James Litinsky.The factory is expected to begin production in 2028 and create 1,5000 direct manufacturing and engineering jobs at the site.\"The Chinese Communist Party represents the most acute national security threat to the United States, yet we remain dependent on the CCP for critical minerals,\" Senator Ted Cruz (R-Texas) said in a statement. \"MP Materials is building the infrastructure needed to undo that dependence and bolster American national security,\" he added.watch now",

    "body": "A view of Bryggen, the historic Hanseatic Wharf in Bergen, Norway, on Sept. 16, 2024.Manuel Romano | Nurphoto | Getty ImagesNorway's $2 trillion oil fund, the largest of its kind, generated an annual profit of about $248 billion last year, with strong gains in global equities driving a 15.1% return.Norges Bank Investment Management (NBIM) manages the fund, which was set up in the 1990s to invest revenues from Norway's oil and gas industry, on behalf of the Norwegian population. It's an investor in more than 7,200 companies across 60 countries and has stakes in around 1.5% of the world's publicly listed stocks.The fund's value stood at around $2.2 trillion at the end of 2025, up from about $2.08 trillion a year earlier.The fund generated a 2.36 trillion Norwegian kroner, or $248 billion, gain last year, or 15.1%. That was 0.28 percentage points, or 50 billion kroner, lower than its benchmark index's performance. In a statement, NBIM CEO Nicolai Tangen highlighted a \"strong upturn\" in global equities, with U.S. technology the biggest contributor, along with financials, as the portfolio weathered U.S. tariff increases. He also highlighted \"positive developments\" in renewables infrastructure investments.Acknowledging that 2025 had been a year of \"constant turmoil and surprises,\" Tangen said solid corporate earnings, optimism around AI and central bank interest rate cuts helped lift its equity investments.\"U.S. technology stocks contributed most to the positive return, driven mainly by the largest technology companies,\" he said in the report.Overall, nearly 40% of NBIM's investments are in U.S. equities, with its most valuable holdings including a 1.3% stake in Nvidia, a 1.2% stake in Apple and a 1.3% stake in Microsoft. NBIM also invests in fixed income, real estate and renewable energy infrastructure.watch nowIts equities investments, which have a market value of about $1.6 trillion and make up more than 71% of the fund, returned 19.3% last year.That was followed by its unlisted renewable energy infrastructure portfolio, which generated an 18.1% gain. Last year, the fund made several renewable power investments, including in Germany's largest electricity grid.Fixed income assets, which make up more than 26% of the fund's assets at $594 billion, advanced 5.4%, while its unlisted real estate investments rose 4.4%On Thursday, NBIM said it was now using AI to screen investments for ethical issues, a process that began in late 2024 when it introduced Anthropic's Claude model to its ESG process. Late last year, the fund suspended its usual ESG assessment processes after the White House criticized its decision to divest a holding in American firm Caterpillar over its ties to the conflict in the West Bank. watch now",

    "body": "A guard walks past the National Stock Exchange building in Mumbai, India, on February 9, 2018.Danish Siddiqui | Reuters India's benchmark Nifty 50 stock index rose 5% on open Tuesday, after New Delhi and Washington announced a long-awaited trade deal that saw a sharp cut in U.S. tariffs on Indian exports.U.S. President Donald Trump on Monday stateside said that U.S. will cut reciprocal tariff on India to 18% from 25%. He added that India will reduce its tariff and non-tariff barriers against the U.S. to zero. The U.S. had levied 50% tariffs on India, including a 25% duty for purchasing Russian oil, but Trump's announcement only mentioned cutting \"reciprocal\" tariffs causing some confusion. Reuters, however, reported citing sources that the overall tariff had been reduced to 18%. Trump said that during his call with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, India agreed to stop buying Russian oil and instead \"buy much more\" from U.S.Modi, in his post on X, said that \"made in India\" products will now face reduced tariffs of 18% in the U.S. while extending support for U.S. president's efforts to usher global peace, stability and prosperity. At the beginning of 2025, India was expected to be among the first countries to sign an agreement with the U.S. and the lack of an \"explicit deal\" created a \"rift between India's robust macros and the weak performance of different asset classes,\" Citi Research said in its report on Tuesday.The reduction in tariffs has come in \"materially better than consensus expectations,\" said Trideep Bhattacharya, president, equities, at Edelweiss Asset Management.\"When combined with the recently concluded India–EU trade agreement, this potentially represents one of the strongest external growth stimuli for the Indian economy in 2026,\" she added.The Nifty pared some gains and was last trading about 4% higher, putting it on course for its best day in nearly six years, if gains hold.  Indian equity market was among the weakest performers in emerging countries as foreign investors exited in record numbers, with the Nifty gaining a little over 10%. In dollar terms, given the decline in the rupee, markets underperformed even more. The MSCI India index [dollar] gained just 4.29% in 2025 as compared to MSCI Emerging Markets index that rose 33.57%. The rupee was Asia's worst performing currency in 2025, hurt by the absence of a trade deal with the U.S., India's largest export market and persistent outflows in foreign funds. Following the announcement of the deal, the Rupee strengthened 1% and was last trading at 90.29 per dollar.\"This breakthrough is unequivocally positive\" for exports, sentiments and financial markets, Radhika Rao, senior economist and executive director at DBS Banks said, adding that \"domestic markets are expected to witness a relief rally,\" as high tariffs were a key drag on sentiment in the past quarter.",

    "body": "Michele Bullock, governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA), speaks during a news conference at the bank's head office in Sydney, Australia, on Tuesday, Apr. 1, 2025. Bloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesAustralia's central bank raised its policy rate by 25 basis points to 3.85% on Tuesday, marking the Reserve Bank of Australia's first rate hike since November 2023 as inflation continues to climb. The Reserve Bank of Australia's move matched expectations from economists polled by Reuters and followed data showing inflation at its highest level in six quarters.  \"Private demand is growing more quickly than expected, capacity pressures are greater than previously assessed and labour market conditions are a little tight,\" according to the central bank's statement, noting that inflationary pressure picked up \"materially\" in the second half of last year.  Senior RBA officials have repeatedly pushed back against expectations of rate cuts. Earlier this year, Reserve Bank of Australia Deputy Gov. Andrew Hauser said the likelihood of near-term rate cuts was \"probably very low,\" citing persistently high inflation. The central bank has an inflation target of 2.5% Gov. Michele Bullock echoed that stance after the bank's rate decision on Dec. 9, saying interest rate cuts were not on the horizon for the foreseeable future.When asked at the time if the bank would consider further increases, Bullock said that the bank would assess economic data on a \"meeting-by-meeting\" basis.\"If inflation continues to be persistent and looks like it is not coming back down towards the Board's target... the Board might have to consider whether or not it's appropriate to keep interest rates where they are or in fact at some point raise them,\" she said. Australia's economy grew 2.1% in the third quarter, up from a revised 2% in the previous quarter and marking its fastest pace of expansion in about two years. ",

David Ake | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesThe Bureau of Labor Statistics will not be releasing the January jobs report as scheduled Friday due to the partial government shutdown, a department spokesman confirmed Monday.\"The Employment Situation release for January 2026 will not be released as scheduled on Friday, February 6, 2026. The release will be rescheduled upon the resumption of government funding,\" Emily Liddel, associate commissioner of the BLS, said in a statement.Following last year's record shutdown that stretched into early November, the bureau also was forced to delay a number of its routine releases and was just catching up from that incident. The BLS also releases the consumer price index, import and export data, and multiple other labor- and consumer-related data pieces.It was not known if the Commerce Department also would face delays in its reporting due to the impasse in Washington.The decision comes ahead of a busy week for economic data that would have culminated with the nonfarm payrolls release, also known as the unemployment situation. The report includes a count of how many hires businesses report, which provides the headline nonfarm payrolls count, as well as a household survey of how many people report holding jobs, which is used to tabulate the unemployment rate.Markets had been expecting the report to show an increase of 55,000 jobs and the unemployment rate to hold steady at 4.4%.In addition to the payrolls count, the BLS also was scheduled on Tuesday to release the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey.The government closed its doors again Saturday after Congress was unable to come up with a spending plan by the deadline. One of the sticking points in the bill was funding for the Department of Homeland Security following unrest over its efforts to stem illegal immigration.House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., said over the weekend that he expects the impasse could be resolved by Tuesday.",

    "body": "Saimemory, a subsidiary of multinational investment giant SoftBank, has signed a collaboration agreement with American chipmaker Intel Corp. to advance the commercialization of next-generation memory technology, the companies announced Tuesday.The partnership focuses on next-generation memory technologies that can support the growing demands of artificial intelligence and high-performance computing. The effort is currently known as the \"Z-Angle Memory program,\" or ZAM.Prototypes are expected by the fiscal year ending March 31, 2028, with commercialization targeted for fiscal 2029, according to a SoftBank press release. Shares of SoftBank rose 3.13%, while Intel stock rose 5% in overnight trading on Robinhood following the announcement.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconSaimemory, established in December 2024, will draw on memory technology and expertise from Intel, particularly from initiatives it undertook as part of the U.S. Department of Energy's Advanced Memory Technology program.The program focused on developing core technologies for advanced memory. Intel's involvement specifically targeted improvements in performance and power efficiency for next-generation Dynamic random-access memory (DRAM) used in computers and servers.\"Standard memory architectures aren't meeting AI needs,\"  Dr. Joshua Fryman, Intel Fellow and CTO of Intel Government Technologies, said in a statement. He added that Intel has developed a new memory architecture and assembly approach that improves DRAM performance while lowering power use and costs, positioning the technology for broader adoption over the next decade.The partnership comes amid surging demand for memory used in AI-related applications. This demand has vastly outpaced supply, which has triggered shortages across the memory supply chain.  The emphasis on energy efficiency for the ZAM program also also reflects growing concerns over the vast energy consumption needed for AI computing.  The collaboration between Intel and SoftBank on next-generation memory technology was first reported by Nikkei Asia last year. Fujitsu, a Japanese multinational IT equipment and services company, is also reportedly involved in the project. ",

    "body": "U.S. President Donald Trump speaks on the day he announced the creation of a critical mineral reserve, in the Oval Office at the White House, Feb. 2, 2026. Evelyn Hockstein | ReutersPresident Donald Trump on Monday said a criminal investigation into Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell should continue, shrugging off a Republican senator's vow to block Trump's Fed chair replacement pick unless the probe is dropped.U.S. Attorney for Washington Jeanine Pirro, who is leading the unprecedented probe of the central bank chairman, should \"take it to the end and see,\" Trump told reporters in the Oval Office.The president had been asked if Pirro ought to abandon her efforts in light of Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., declaring on Friday that he will oppose any new Fed nominee until the Powell investigation is fully resolved.Tillis drew that line in the sand on the same day that Trump, after a monthslong audition process, announced Kevin Warsh as his pick to succeed Powell as Fed chair.Tillis is a member of the Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee, which has 13 Republicans and 11 Democrats. If Tillis sides with all Democrats on the panel in opposing Warsh, he could set up a stalemate that would prevent the nominee from advancing to a full Senate vote.Powell had revealed on Jan. 11 that he was under criminal investigation.That announcement came after months of Trump and his allies regularly slamming Powell over his refusal to lower interest rates as quickly or steeply as the president wants.Powell accused the administration of threatening him with prosecution because the Fed, despite Trump's pressure, has made its rate-setting decisions \"based on our best assessment of what will serve the public, rather than following the preferences of the President.\"Read more CNBC politics coverageHouse hardliners complicate ending government shutdown as Speaker Johnson moves aheadTrump says U.S. and India reached trade deal, will lower tariffs immediatelyUnited Arab Emirates' 'Spy Sheikh' bought secret stake in Trump crypto company: WSJEpstein files: Ro Khanna says DOJ's latest release is 'not good enough'Speaker Johnson: 'Confident' government shutdown will end by TuesdayCNBC reported Wednesday that the Fed has not yet complied with grand jury subpoenas issued as part of Pirro's probe.Trump has repeatedly suggested that the yearslong, multibillion-dollar renovation of the Fed's Washington headquarters involves either incompetence or corruption by Powell.\"It's either gross incompetence or it's theft of some kind, kickbacks. I don't know what it is,\" Trump said in Monday's Oval Office remarks. \"But Jeanine Pirro is incredible, and she'll figure it out,\" he added.The Fed has defended the renovation efforts, saying they will reduce costs for the central bank over time, and sought to explain cost increases.

Jonathan Ernst | ReutersDays before Super Bowl 60, New York Attorney General Letitia James has a message for consumers: Be careful about placing trades on prediction markets.\"New Yorkers need to know the significant risks with unregulated prediction markets,\" James said in a statement Monday. \"It's crystal clear: so-called prediction markets do not have the same consumer protections as regulated platforms. I urge all New Yorkers to be cautious of these platforms to protect their money.\"Prediction platforms like Kalshi and Polymarket are expected to generate billions of dollars in trading volume around the Super Bowl. Consumers can make trades on game events — similar to online sportsbooks like DraftKings or FanDuel — as well as on predetermined outcomes, such as which companies will advertise during the Super Bowl, an issue CNBC Sport reported on last week. James said the platforms' products are bets \"masquerading\" as event contracts, which are generally regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. Kalshi, which initially declined to comment, said in statement later Monday, \"We agree that consumers should steer clear of unregulated prediction markets. Our members' platforms are all regulated by the CFTC, similar to how the SEC regulates the stock market. Regulation comes with many of the guardrails the AG outlines - a ban on insider trading, self-exclusion, and responsible trading guidelines. We all want the same thing: safe, fair, and legitimate products.\"Representatives for Polymarket didn't immediately respond to request for comment. Get the CNBC Sport newsletter directly to your inboxThe CNBC Sport newsletter with Alex Sherman brings you the biggest news and exclusive interviews from the worlds of sports business and media, delivered weekly to your inbox.Subscribe here to get access today.James warned that concerns around the nascent prediction market industry include \"upholding prohibitions against insider betting and requiring regulatory review to ensure the financial stability and integrity of gambling operators.\"\"Prediction markets may appear as modern, high-tech platforms for speculation or 'forecasting,' but in practice, many operate as unregulated gambling without the basic protections New York consumers both deserve and expect from properly licensed operators,\" James said in the statement.Prediction market contracts trade somewhat similarly to all-or-nothing options, with contracts priced between $0 and $1. The contracts trade up or down depending on the action. In addition to contracts on Super Bowl commercials, both Polymarket and Kalshi are offering other trades related to the game, including on matters like \"What songs will be played at the halftime show?,\" \"Who will attend the big game?,\" and more traditional sportsbook \"bets\" such as \"Seattle vs. New England: Most Rushing Yards,\" as CNBC reported last week. There are laws that prohibit insider trading on prediction markets, just as on traditional financial markets. But industry experts say they're skeptical that the CFTC, recently gutted as part of widespread government cuts, has the will or the means to police those problems. Last week, CFTC Chairman Michael Selig said he had directed agency staff to withdraw a proposed rule that would have banned prediction trades on sports and politics. He said new rules would be coming.Disclosure: CNBC has a commercial relationship with Kalshi. ",

That was a series C round of $5.6 billion at a $45 billion valuation. Alphabet committed $5 billion in a multiyear investment to Waymo at the time.\"​​This milestone is built on a foundation of safety that is now statistically superior to human driving,\" Waymo co-CEOs Tekedra Mawakana and Dmitri Dolgov wrote in a blog post. \"We are no longer proving a concept; we are scaling a commercial reality.\"The latest funding round was led by Alphabet alongside previous backers, including Andreessen Horowitz, Fidelity, Perry Creek, Silver Lake, Tiger Global and T. Rowe Price. The new round includes additional investors such as Dragoneer Investment Group, DST Global, Sequoia Capital, Kleiner Perkins and Alphabet-owned investment firm GV.Alphabet itself is the \"majority investor,\" according to the blog.The new capital will help the company move \"with unprecedented velocity, while maintaining our industry-leading safety standards,\" Waymo said. \"Our focus is now on global scale, bringing the safety and magic of the Waymo Driver to even more cities this year across the United States and international.\"CNBC previously reported that the Google sister company was set to raise at least $15 billion at a valuation of $110 billion.Waymo's robotaxi service currently operates in the markets of Austin, the San Francisco Bay Area, Phoenix, Atlanta, Los Angeles and Miami, where it began offering service in January. The company served 15 million trips in 2025, Waymo said in Monday's blog.In 2026, Waymo plans to open service in Dallas, Denver, Detroit, Houston, Las Vegas, Miami, Nashville, Orlando, San Antonio, San Diego and Washington. It also plans to expand to London, its first international market.The company has begun facing challenges as it rapidly expands.Waymo issued a software recall in December for its vehicles after Texas officials said the robotaxis illegally passed school buses at least 19 times since the start of the school year, and last month, Waymo struck a child near an elementary school in Santa Monica, California.

    "body": "Representative Anna Paulina Luna, a Republican from Florida, during the Republican National Convention at the Fiserv Forum in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, July 16, 2024.Al Drago | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesHouse Speaker Mike Johnson is running into problems with his own caucus as he tries to advance a Senate-approved measure to reopen most of the government, which shut down on Saturday morning. Though opposition appears to be thawing after a White House meeting Monday with some of the holdouts. The House Rules Committee is meeting Monday evening about the measure that would fund a wide swath of the government, the first step in getting the bill to the House floor. The bill cleared the Senate on Friday after Democrats there had funding for the Department of Homeland Security stripped and replaced with two weeks of stopgap funding for the agency — a change that requires the House to reapprove the measure.  Because Democrats are not helping Johnson and the GOP fast-track the measure, the speaker will likely have to work within his own razor-thin majority to advance the bill when it reaches the floor for a critical preliminary vote as early as Monday night. At least two Republicans so far have warned they will not support the bill unless it includes a controversial voter-ID measure known as the SAVE Act, a new hurdle for Johnson as he aims to end the shutdown. And the Republican majority shrunk Monday after Democrat Christian Menefee was sworn in to represent a Houston district after being elected Saturday in a special election.Read more CNBC politics coverageHouse hardliners complicate ending government shutdown as Speaker Johnson moves aheadTrump says U.S. and India reached trade deal, will lower tariffs immediatelyUnited Arab Emirates' 'Spy Sheikh' bought secret stake in Trump crypto company: WSJEpstein files: Ro Khanna says DOJ's latest release is 'not good enough'Speaker Johnson: 'Confident' government shutdown will end by Tuesday\"I have been clear: the SAVE Act/Save America Act must be attached to the rule for these appropriations bills and sent back to the Senate for a vote,\" Rep. Anna Paulina Luna, R-Fla., said Sunday in a post to X. \"This is my price for a 'yes' vote.\"On Monday night, however, Luna said she was moving toward supporting the measure in a procedural vote after a meeting with the White House. \"Based on our discussions right now, we're moving towards it,\" Luna told reporters at the Capitol Monday night, saying she's comfortable with how the Senate might consider the voter-ID bill. \"Frankly, we want a vote on voter ID in the Senate, and I think we're gonna get it.\"But Rep. Eric Burlison, R-Mo., another holdout who called for the SAVE Act to be included earlier in the day, appears to be digging in. \"House Republicans shouldn't let Schumer dictate the terms of government funding,\" Burlison said, referring to Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y. \"If Dems want to play games, no spending package should come out of the House without the SAVE Act attached — securing American elections must be a non-negotiable.\"Later Monday, Burlison posted to X that \"The Senate minibus is just as bad as it was when it left the House—filled with Democrat earmarks and $5 billion in refugee welfare funding.\" \"I was a no then, and I'm a no now,\" he said. President Donald Trump on Monday urged Congress to hurry up and send the spending package to him to sign into law.\"We need to get the Government open, and I hope all Republicans and Democrats will join me in supporting this Bill, and send it to my desk WITHOUT DELAY,\" he said in a post to Truth Social, saying the House should pass the Senate version without making additional changes.At the White House on Monday, Trump told reporters he thinks Congress is \"pretty close to a resolution.\"But Democrats won't make the process easy. The House needs to approve the rule before the chamber can vote on the underlying measure and send it to the White House to be signed into law.House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., on Monday said at a press conference he doesn't expect Democrats to support the rule when it advances to the floor from the Rules Committee. Democrats have called for more restrictions on immigration enforcement after federal agents in Minneapolis shot and killed two U.S. citizens. \"Republicans are in the majority in this institution,\" Jeffries said. \"If they have some massive mandate, then go pass your rule.\"The spending package won support from a key Democrat when House Appropriations Committee ranking member Rosa DeLauro, D-Conn., said Monday she would support the bill on the floor. However, she did not say whether she would support the rule. \"I will support this package,\" DeLauro said.DeLauro said passing the bill would give Democrats \"leverage\" to secure changes to immigration enforcement that Democrats are seeking.\"If we do not do that, we will not be able to bring the kinds of pressure that is necessary,\" DeLauro said.Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said Monday afternoon in an X post that \"every officer in the field in Minneapolis\" would be equipped with body cameras. Democrats have pressed during the spending bill negotiations for body cameras.The demands present Johnson with a tightrope walk. Without Democratic support, he will hold a minuscule one-vote majority to advance anything along party lines. But adding the SAVE Act to the measure would likely doom it in the Senate, where it would need to be reapproved with at least 60 votes to skirt the filibuster. Schumer said the bill would be dead on arrival in the Senate if the SAVE Act is added. \"I have said it before and I'll say it again, the SAVE Act would impose Jim Crow type laws to the entire country and is dead on arrival in the Senate,\" Schumer said Monday in a statement. \"If House Republicans add the SAVE Act to the bipartisan appropriations package it will lead to another prolonged Trump government shutdown.\"This a developing story.

    "body": "Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman with Union Minister of State for Finance Pankaj Chaudhary and other officials outside the Finance Ministry prior to the presentation of the Union Budget 2026-27 at Kartavya Bhavan on Feb. 1, 2026 in New Delhi, India.Hindustan Times | Hindustan Times | Getty ImagesIndia has announced a 20-year tax exemption for hyperscalers that use data centers in the country to service global clients, in a move that could shift artificial intelligence-driven businesses to the South Asian country.According to experts, cost of data center infrastructure is already low in India and coupled with the tax holiday it will make using data centers in India for global delivery more attractive for hyperscalers, compared to competing hubs including Singapore, UAE and Ireland.Hyperscalers refer to cloud computing giants such as Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud that are investing heavily in data center infrastructure that power AI models. \"This proposal will significantly increase the hyperscaler demand and major foreign firms will now find India a significantly cheaper base for global workloads,\" Riaz Thingna, partner, tax, regulatory and finance consulting at Grant Thornton Bharat, told CNBC. This move positions India not just as a \"consumption market\" for data center demand but as a \"global cloud computing and AI computing hub,\" Thingna said, adding that currently hyperscalers face \"corporate income tax exposure\" if they have \"significant economic presence\" in India. Currently, data center operations of foreign hyperscalers in India are considered permanent establishment and the profits arising from these operations are taxed at 35% plus surcharge and cess, explained Kumarmanglam Vijay, partner and head of practice-direct tax at legal firm JSA Advocates and Solicitors. Now, cloud services provided by global hyperscalers using data centers owned and operated by a local developer will be exempt from tax until 2047, India's Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said during her budget speech on Sunday, adding that it will \"boost investment in data centers.\"India's role in the global AI race has been limited so far as it lacks strong local foundational models, chip manufacturing abilities and large data center capacities as compared to the U.S. and China.The proposed tax holiday and the investment it is likely to bring could accentuate India's role in global AI race at a time when the country is seeing increasing interest from tech behemoths that have announced billions in AI-related infrastructure investments.  India's Electronics and Information Technology Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw said at the recently concluded World Economic Forum that India was \"making very good progress\" in all the five layers of AI architecture — applications, models, chip, infra and energy.Apart from attracting hyperscalers, India has been doubling down on its AI ambitions by incentivizing semiconductor design and production companies to set up in the country. Tax holidayThe tax exemption is likely to benefit Indian IT and cloud service firms such as Infosys, Wipro, TCS, HCL Tech and Jio, according to experts, as well as local data center developers.The tax holiday is \"a positive sign for sustained, cost-effective capacity creation,\" said Raju Vegesna, chairman at Indian data center developer Sify Technologies. Google, which has entered into a partnership with AdaniConneX, to build a $15 billion data center at a new artificial intelligence hub in southern India, is likely to be among the big beneficiaries of the proposed tax holiday.Last December, in under 24 hours, Microsoft and Amazon pledged more than $50 billion toward India's cloud and AI infrastructure — details on local partners have not been shared by them.  Google and Microsoft did not immediately respond to CNBC's requests for comments, while Amazon Web Services declined to comment.Data center demand globally has surged in recent years, largely driven by the explosion in AI workloads, which require vast computing power, electrical power, cooling and networking infrastructure. More than $61 billion has flowed into the data center market so far in 2025.A server room at a data center in India.Dhiraj Singh | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesIndia opportunityIndia's current data center capacity is around 1.2 gigawatts but the market is set to more than double, crossing 3 gigawatts within the next five years. According to a January report by real estate consultancy JLL, global data center capacity was 103 GW and is expected to double to 200GW by 2030 due to the AI boom.The tax holiday for foreign cloud companies will remove \"the single biggest friction point for global hyperscalers entering India,\" said Anshuman Magazine, CEO of India, South-East Asia, Middle East & Africa at real estate consultancy CBRE.Global capital inflows in India's data center space will \"increase substantially\" he said, as the tax incentive gives a 20-year runway to earn return on investment.As markets such as Japan, Australia, China and Singapore in the Asia Pacific region have matured, with, Singapore, one of the oldest data center hubs in the region, having limited room to deploy large-scale data centers due to land availability issues, India stands to gain, experts said.The country has abundant space for large-scale data center developments. When compared with data center hubs in Europe, power costs in India are relatively low. Coupled with India's growing renewable energy capacity — critical for power-hungry data centers — and the economics begin to look compelling.The tax holiday for foreign cloud service firms could do for India's cloud and data center ecosystem what the IT services incentives did in the early 2000s said S. Anjani Kumar, partner Deloitte India, adding that it will \"catalyze large-scale global investment, expand export revenues, and lead to long-term job and capability creation.\"",

    "body": "A vendor shows various models and weights of silver bullion at a gold jewellery manufacturer in \"El Sagha\", as gold prices recorded an increase after a devaluation of the local currency, at the gold market area in Cairo, Egypt January 14, 2024. Amr Abdallah Dalsh | ReutersSilver's rapid surge and equally dramatic reversal in recent weeks has led market watchers to ask a fundamental question: when does an asset stop trading on fundamentals and start behaving like a meme?The volatility in silver prices has drawn growing comparisons to meme stocks such as GameStop, the video-game retailer that became a global phenomenon in 2021 after retail traders on Reddit piled in en masse, sending its shares soaring far beyond what traditional valuation models could justify.Meme stocks are typically characterized by a few core traits: sharp, often parabolic price moves, heavy participation by retail investors and narratives that go viral on social media, sometimes overwhelming fundamentals altogether. Liquidity can rush in quickly, and often exits just as fast.Michael Antonelli, market strategist at Bull and Baird, laid out the comparison bluntly on X: \"How is Silver different than, say, GameStop?\" he asked in a post last week. \"Is this not a meme now?\"He told CNBC that the metal has reached a kind of \"zeitgeist\" with retail traders who are starting to move as a herd. While silver does have industrial and consumer uses, prices do not usually move over 100% in three months: \"It is totally disconnected and went vertical based on retail flows,\" he said.Individual investors on Jan. 26 poured about $171 million net into the iShares Silver Trust, a popular exchange-traded fund that tracks the metal, according to recent market research firm VandaTrack. That was almost double the previous peak recorded during the \"silver squeeze\" of 2021. Spot silver prices advanced almost 5% to $83.37 per ounce on Tuesday, while silver futures in New York rose over 9% to $84 per ounce. Over the past month, silver has recorded 10 moves of 5% or more in either direction. \"Silver has just become retail's new [favorite] toy,\" Vanda analyst Ashwin Bhakre said.That enthusiasm is visible across Reddit. The platform played a central role in the original meme-stock phenomenon, with Reddit community WallStreetBets being at the forefront of coordinating retail buying in GameStop in 2021.On the Reddit Silverbugs forum — a community where users document physical purchases, debate price targets and share memes — posts following the recent sell-off are emblematic of the meme-stock culture.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconSilver prices in the past month\"Bought the dip today! DIAMOND HANDS,\" wrote Reddit user Jstaakz following the sell-off Friday. \"Diamond hands\" is a meme-stock term used by retail traders to signal that they plan to keep holding an asset despite sharp losses or extreme volatility, often as a show of conviction or defiance against selling pressure.Another user asked fellow traders for advice on Monday on whether they should hold or sell their silver, adding that it was bought at $48 per ounce last June.\"Silver is just GameStop in 2026,\" Antonelli said.A self-fulfilling frenzyFor some analysts, silver's behavior has crossed a familiar and dangerous threshold.Rhona O'Connell, head of market Intelligence at StoneX, warned that prices had detached from sustainable levels.\"Silver was massively over-valued and in a self-fulfilling frenzy; it is however notoriously fickle and its history is littered with examples of price crashes,\" she said. \"At present it is behaving like Icarus and to extend the analogy there is a strong risk of other buyers getting burned.\"Tom Sosnoff, chief executive officer at financial technology platform Lossdog, even included gold into the meme fold: \"Gold and silver have been absolutely kind of the meme commodity of 2026 ... the silver move has been wild ... We're basically seeing a multi-year moves in less than 30 days.\" \"Huge volume, huge volatility, not too much rhyme or reason why. I mean, you can make up as many fundamental or technical reasons as you want, but it's a meme stock trade,\" Sosnoff said.He cautioned that newer participants were drawn in by headlines and social media. \"If you've never traded silver before in the futures market or in the ETF market, just be careful. These are big contracts, and they fly around, and they're moving around at levels that, you know, we've never seen before.\"Henrietta Treyz, managing partner at Veda Partners, said the dynamic was unmistakable. \"The moves in precious metals are really quite something, whether it's gold or silver. And you can tell as an outside observer that the meme stock component is very much alive and well,\" she said. \"It reminds me of GameStop.\"However, not everyone agrees silver should be lumped in with narrative-only assets.Vasu Menon, managing director of investment strategy at OCBC, said silver \"sometimes behaves like a meme commodity, but it isn't one by nature,\" pointing to industrial demand from solar panels, electric vehicles and electronics. Menon, however, acknowledged that speculation had amplified recent moves and that sharp corrections were part of silver's DNA.",

    "body": "People walk in front of Cinderella's Castle at the Magic Kingdom Park at Walt Disney World in Orlando, Florida, May 31, 2024.Gary Hershorn | Corbis News | Getty ImagesAll is well in the Magic Kingdom — and all of Disney's other theme parks, too.The company's experiences division, which includes its parks, cruise ships, hotels and consumer products, posted record revenue for the fiscal first quarter, topping $10 billion for the first time in Disney's more-than-100-year history. It also posted operating income of $3.3 billion, a 6% bump from the same period a year ago.Growth in this segment has supercharged in the wake of the Covid pandemic. It often accounts for the lion's share of the company's profits. For the period ended Dec. 27, experiences represented 38% of Disney's total revenue, yet generated a whopping 71% of its operating income.Company executives expect those good times to continue, forecasting high-single-digit growth in operating income for the segment for fiscal 2026.\"When you look at the footprint of the business today, it's never been more broad or more diverse,\" Bob Iger, CEO of Disney, said during Monday's earnings call. \"And the projects that we have underway are going to make it even more so.\"The strong parks performance comes against the backdrop of a CEO succession competition that could see Chairman of Disney Experiences Josh D'Amaro step in for Iger. The Disney board is meeting this week and is expected to vote on its next CEO, according to people familiar with the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity about internal matters. Industry insiders and Disney sources expect D'Amaro to be appointed Iger's successor, though the decision ultimately lies with the Disney board and won't be final until directors vote.\"The board has not yet selected the next CEO of The Walt Disney Company and once that decision is made, we will announce it,\" a Disney spokesperson said in a statement, declining to comment on the timing of the next board meeting. Parks expansionMuch of the experiences division's success comes from major investments to expand the footprint of Disney theme parks, refurbish existing rides and themed areas of its parks, add cruise ships to its fleet and grow its digital gaming presence. This new evolution of the segment is being fueled by Disney's library of franchises and iconic intellectual property.Disney has long pulled from its portfolio of content. Disneyland opened its doors more than 70 years ago with rides based on \"Alice in Wonderland,\" \"The Adventures of Ichabod and Mr. Toad,\" \"Peter Pan\" and \"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.\"While those classic attractions remain, the company's more recent developments have been fueled by Iger's strategic acquisitions of four major film studios — Pixar in 2006, Marvel in 2009, Lucasfilm in 2012 and 20th Century Fox in 2019. This brought coveted franchises under the House of Mouse roof, including \"Star Wars,\" \"Toy Story,\" \"Avengers\" and \"Avatar.\"\"As we added IP to our stable ... we gained access to intellectual property that had real value in terms of parks and resorts, and enabled us to lean into more capital spending because of the confidence level we had in improving returns,\" Iger said.Having the film and television rights to these properties allows the company more control over production and how that translates into rides, experiences and merchandise.And that work continues as part of a 10-year, $60 billion investment effort that launched in 2023.\"We have expansion projects underway at every one of our theme parks,\" Iger said.He touted the upcoming opening of the World of Frozen at Disneyland Paris and the launch of a new cruise ship, the Disney Adventure, which will make berth in Asia. On the horizon is also a new villains land coming to Magic Kingdom as well of the reshaping of Rivers of America, Tom Sawyer Island and the Liberty Square Riverboat into an area called Piston Peak — a second \"Cars\"-themed land modeled after America's natural parks. At Hollywood Studios there will be a new \"Monsters Inc.\" land while the Muppets will take over the Rock 'n' Roller Coaster attraction. Animal Kingdom will host an \"Encanto\" ride and a new \"Indiana Jones\" ride. At Disneyland, Avengers Campus, the Marvel-themed area, will get two new attractions, guests will get a glimpse at the Land of the Dead from \"Coco\" and Disney will build a new \"Avatar\" area inspired by the scenery in \"Avatar: Fire and Ash.\"Internationally, Disney has struck a deal to bring a new park and resort to Yas Island in the United Arab Emirates.International headwindsThe company's commitment to bringing beloved IP into its parks is paying off, according to Iger, particularly outside the U.S.\"The percentage of people that go to Shanghai Disneyland just to go to Zootopia Land is very, very high,\" he said Monday.Revenue from international theme parks and experiences grew 7% during the fiscal first quarter, to $1.75 billion.Of course, the company is still facing headwinds from the decline of international visitors to its domestic parks. It's a trend that many theme park destinations in America are contending with, as overall tourism to the United States fell 6% in 2025. Industry analysts point to higher travel costs and fees, ongoing trade frictions and geopolitical unease for the drop in demand for travel stateside.Despite this, domestic theme park and experiences revenue grew 7% during the quarter, to $6.91 billion.New offerings at Disney's international parks, the launch of a cruise ship that services Asia and the new Abu Dhabi park are all ways that Disney can tap into that foreign market and engage with consumers that are not making the trek to the company's domestic destinations.— CNBC's Julia Boorstin and Alex Sherman contributed to this report.

    "body": "One kilogram and a five hundred gram gold bars next to one kilogram silver bars at The Vaults Group gold dealers arranged in Barcelona, Spain, on Monday, April 28, 2025.Bloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesGold and silver prices rebounded on Tuesday after suffering a historic sell-off, with analysts suggesting that the recent corrections were more a positioning reset than a sustained downturn.Gold prices clawed back ground after falling on Monday and plunging nearly 10% on Friday —  steepest single-day declines in decades. Silver also recovered modestly after a roughly 30% collapse that marked its worst one-day performance since 1980. Spot gold jumped as much as 4% on Tuesday, and was last trading over 2% higher at $4,771.76 per ounce. Gold futures in New York were last up 3%, hovering at around $4,791.Spot silver advanced as much as 7.8%, and was last trading 2.6% higher at $81.3 per ounce on Tuesday. Silver futures in New York were up 7% at $82.67 per ounce. The rebound came as investors reassessed whether the rout signaled a structural turning point or an exaggerated reaction to short-term catalysts.Strategists at Deutsche Bank said history suggests it is short-term catalysts, even as the scale of the sell-off has raised fresh questions about market positioning. The bank said that while signs of elevated speculative activity have been building for months, they are insufficient on their own to explain the magnitude of last week's move.\"The adjustment in precious metal prices overshot the significance of its ostensible catalysts. Moreover, investor intentions in precious (official, institutional, individual) have not likely changed for the worse.\"Stock Chart IconStock chart iconGold and silver prices rebound after steep selloffThe sell-off was triggered by a combination of factors, including a rebound in the U.S. dollar, shifts in expectations around Federal Reserve leadership following President Donald Trump's nomination of Kevin Warsh as the next Fed chair, and position-trimming ahead of the weekend.Deutsche Bank said the broader investment case for gold and silver remains intact.\"Gold's thematic drivers remain positive and we believe investors' rationale for gold (and precious) allocations will not have changed. The conditions do not appear primed for a sustained reversal in gold prices, and we draw some contrasts between today's circumstance and the context for gold's weakness in the 1980s and 2013.\"Barclays struck a similar tone, acknowledging overheated technicals and stretched positioning, but said that the broader \"bid\" for gold can remain resilient amid geopolitical and policy uncertainties and reserve-diversification themes.Silver's whipsaw has been more dramatic, reflecting its smaller market, higher volatility and heavier retail participation. However, some analysts still maintain a bullish case for the white metal.\"Speculative positioning has definitely played a role in the short term. Silver has attracted more retail participation than gold and that makes it that much more sensitive to fast-moving sentiment and short-term trading,\" said Zavier Wong, market analyst at eToro.Wong, however, added it may be \"too simplistic\" to attribute the entire move to speculation. Silver has genuine industrial demand, particularly tied to areas linked to data centers and AI infrastructure. A study published in January projected that global silver demand will surge this decade, driven largely by solar photovoltaics and the shift to more silver-intensive cell technologies. Total demand is forecast to reach 48,000 tonnes to 54,000 tonnes a year by 2030, while supply is expected to rise only to about 34,000 tonnes, meaning just 62%-70% of demand would be met.The solar sector alone is seen consuming 10,000-14,000 tonnes annually, or up to 41% of global supply.\"That demand hasn't gone away. What we're seeing here is silver running ahead of itself, which is something it has always done during strong phases,\" said Wong.",

    "body": "watch nowOracle's 5-year credit default swaps tumbled 17% after the software vendor's plan to raise $50 billion in debt and equity bolstered investor confidence that the company will be able to avoid a credit downgrade as it funds its artificial intelligence buildout.  \"Equity financing significantly inhibits the downside for credit,\" Andrew Keches, a credit analyst at Barclays, wrote in a note to clients on Monday. Keches upgraded Oracle's debt to overweight and said that its CDS should compress further.Credit default swaps are like insurance for investors, with buyers paying for protection in case the borrower can't repay its debt.Oracle's CDS soared late last year on concerns that the company's massive data center commitments would damage its balance sheet, putting debt investors at risk. Oracle raised $18 billion in a jumbo bond sale in September, one of the largest debt issuances on record in the tech industry. The 5-year swaps have been viewed by the market as a way for investors to hedge their bets on the AI boom. Oracle has been caught in a \"peak fear\" cycle for the past couple months, with the market reacting negatively to virtually any headline, wrote Keches.Oracle said on Sunday it planned to raise $45 billion to $50 billion in debt and equity this year to build additional capacity to meet contracted demand from its cloud customers, which include Nvidia, Meta, OpenAI and Elon Musk's xAI. Using equity as a lever is a notable signal to bond investors that the company isn't solely reliant on debt. Shares of Oracle are down by half since they peaked in September on fears tied to the company's financing plans and its dependency on OpenAI. At least $300 billion of Oracle's $523 billion in remaining performance obligations is tied to OpenAI, according to analysts at D.A. Davidson. Following the company's quarterly earnings report in December, Oracle executives held back from detailing a comprehensive financing plan, hurting the stock, and pushing up CDS prices.While the latest funding announcement instilled confidence among debt investors, the stock slid another 3% on Monday because the issuance of equity will dilute existing shareholders, at least in the near term. Oracle is using an at-the-money offering that will likely entail selling about 10% of its total traded volume over the next few weeks, traders told CNBC.UBS analysts warned in a note that raising $20 billion to 25 billion from stock sales \"may not be warmly received by all equity holders.\" ",

Trump added that Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi had agreed to step up purchases of U.S. products, according to a Truth Social post on Monday following a call between the two leaders. Under the deal, India will also stop its purchases of Russian crude oil and instead buy more from the U.S., and potentially, Venezuela, Trump added.India's Nifty 50 rose nearly 5% at the open. It was last up 2.73%, while the Sensex index added 2.66%.Japan's Nikkei 225 rose more than 3% to a record high, while the Topix added 2.34%. South Korea's Kospi jumped over 5%, triggering a buy sidecar, which temporarily halts purchase orders. The Korea Exchange said the trigger occurred after KOSPI 200 futures climbed more than 5% for over one minute.

Senior RBA officials have repeatedly pushed back against expectations of rate cuts. Earlier this year, Reserve Bank of Australia Deputy Gov. Andrew Hauser said the likelihood of near-term rate cuts was \"probably very low,\" citing persistently high inflation. The central bank has an inflation target of 2.5%.

    "body": "Walt Disney Company CEO Bob Iger looks on prior to the game between the Philadelphia Eagles and the Green Bay Packers at Lambeau Field on November 10, 2025 in Green Bay, Wisconsin. Michael Reaves | Getty Images Sport | Getty ImagesDisney is ready for its next CEO. On Monday, the company's leadership outlined its recent successes during its quarterly earnings report. CEO Bob Iger made the case that when his soon-to-be-named successor picks up the baton, Disney will be primed to seize the momentum. \"I'm incredibly proud of all that we've accomplished over the past three years to set Disney on the path to continued growth. I'm inspired and energized by the opportunities ahead for this wonderful company,\" Iger told investors on Monday. Iger reclaimed the CEO role in late 2022 after a failed succession plan involving former parks boss Bob Chapek. Disney picked Chapek to succeed Iger in 2020 only to fire him 2½ years later and undo many of the changes he'd implemented. Now, Disney is counting on a smoother handover the second time around, cushioned by a path to growth. The Disney board is meeting this week and is expected to vote on its next CEO, according to people familiar with the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity about internal matters. The company previously said it would announce a replacement for Iger in the first quarter of this year. \"I think what is noteworthy is that when I came back three years ago, I had a tremendous amount that needed fixing,\" Iger said on Monday's call. \"But anyone who runs a company also knows that it can't just be about fixing. It has to be preparing a company for its future ... but taking steps to create opportunities for growth.\"On Monday, Disney topped Wall Street expectations for both revenue and earnings for its fiscal first quarter. The company's experiences division, which includes theme parks, resorts and cruises, notched more than $10 billion in quarterly revenue for the first time. Chairman of Disney Experiences Josh D'Amaro is among the front-runners to be named as the next CEO. Industry insiders and Disney sources expect D'Amaro to be appointed Iger's successor, though the decision ultimately lies with the Disney board and won't be final until directors vote.\"The board has not yet selected the next CEO of The Walt Disney Company and once that decision is made, we will announce it,\" a Disney spokesperson said in a statement, declining to comment on the timing of the next board meeting. Iger said Monday he was \"very, very bullish\" on the parks business and its ability to grow. Disney is now planning to develop a theme park and resort in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, has been launching more cruise ships, and is in the midst of a previously announced investment of $60 billion into its theme parks over the next decade. Meanwhile, Disney's entertainment segment — the unit that houses its TV networks, streaming and theatrical releases, and arguably needed the biggest turnaround in recent years — saw revenue rise 7% in the period. Disney stopped breaking out streaming subscriber growth this quarter, but offered guidance that showed Disney is confident it will continue to grow and offset traditional TV declines. While theme parks, resorts and cruises have been the profit driver for Disney, its TV, streaming and film business is often in focus. Following underwhelming years at the box office, Disney dominated in 2025, and on Monday its leadership touted its slate ahead. \"Looking back just a few years when our movie business was suffering from Covid and the streaming business was obviously not in an acceptable place, it's clear that the future of both of those businesses, or let's call it our entertainment business, is also bright and it's going to grow,\" Iger said on the company's earnings call. Disney's co-chairman of Entertainment, Dana Walden, is also among the Iger lieutenants vying for the CEO seat, CNBC previously reported. Former Morgan Stanley CEO James Gorman has been running the process to select a successor. Given the focus on theme parks in recent years, speculation has recently swung in D'Amaro's favor. \"In a world that changes as much as it does ... trying to preserve the status quo was a mistake,\" Iger said Monday addressing Disney's last leadership transition. \"And I'm certain that my successor will not do that,\" he said. \"They'll be handed, I think, a good hand in terms of the strength of the company, a number of opportunities to grow and also the expectation that in a world that changes, you also have to continue to change and evolve as well.\"— CNBC's Julia Boorstin contributed to this report.

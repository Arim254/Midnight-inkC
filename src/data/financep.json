    "body": "The Macquarie Group Ltd. logo at the company's headquarters in Sydney, Australia, on Wednesday, June 18, 2025. Brent Lewin | Bloomberg | Getty Images  Australia's Qube Holdings announced on Monday that Macquarie Asset Management had submitted a non-binding proposal to acquire the logistics company at an enterprise value of 11.6 billion Australian dollars ($7.49 billion).Macquarie has offered to acquire Qube for AU$5.2 per share in cash, representing a nearly 28% premium to Qube's closing share price of AU$4.07 on Friday.Qube shares jumped 19.4% to close at a record-high of AU$4.86 on Monday, according to LSEG data, while Macquarie Group, the parent company of the asset management unit, saw its shares dip as much as 0.31% to close at AU$193.48. The takeover bid followed a period of negotiations after a lower unsolicited offer from Macquarie asset management earlier, Qube said in its filing, without specifying the exact value of the previous offer. Stock Chart IconStock chart iconQube share price The enterprise value represents about 14.4 times Qube's earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA, for financial year 2025, according to the filing. Enterprise value typically measures a company's total value, comprising its market capitalization and the cost to pay off its debt, minus cash. Qube's operations mostly involve container leasing, car and grain cargo terminals and road and rail transport services. The deal is subject to a \"satisfactory completion\" of due diligence on Qube and its operations, final approval from both companies' boards and regulatory approvals.Qube said it has entered into an exclusivity deed with Macquarie, during which the asset manager would have the opportunity to undertake due diligence until Feb. 1, 2026. \"We look forward to continuing to engage constructively in the best interests of our shareholders,\" Qube Chairman John Bevan said in the filing. In an emailed response Monday, a spokesperson for Macquarie Asset Management declined CNBC's request for comment.  Macquarie Asset Management currently manages almost AU$960 billion in assets globally across public and private markets with portfolio companies covering infrastructure, real estate and agriculture sectors. Following Qube's announcement, Samuel Seow, vice president and equity analyst at Citi Bank, reaffirmed his \"buy\" rating on the company, with a target price of AU$4.9. Seow flagged potential downside risks such as price competition in Australian logistics market and industrial action that may impact Qube's workforce.  The Qube-Macquarie proposed transaction comes at a times when the Australian logistics sector has seen heightened dealmaking activity, with major players seeking to expand their reach in the country. DP World, which operates terminals and warehouses at ports across Australia, earlier this year acquired Silk Logistics for AU$175 million, taking over its landside warehousing and wharf cartage transportation business — operations that involves moving goods from ports to warehouses or other destinations.  Lindsay Australia in May acquired SRT Logistics, Tasmania's largest refrigerated supply chain operator,  for about $108 million, upping the ante in expanding its national cold chain footprint. That followed the acquisition of GJ Freight earlier this year as Lindsay seeks to expand its operations into Western Australia. Separately, Australia's BHP Group, the world's biggest miner, announced Monday that it was abandoning its pursuit of British mining company Anglo American, reversing its attempt at a reportedly $49 billion takeover of Anglo it initiated last year.

    "body": "U.S. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) salutes former U.S. President Donald Trump during a rally in Commerce, Georgia, U.S. March 26, 2022. Alyssa Pointer | ReutersPresident Donald Trump on Saturday reacted to Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene's surprise resignation announcement, saying, \"Marjorie went BAD.\"Trump once again called the Georgia Republican a \"traitor,\" referencing Greene's alliance with Republican Rep. Tom Massie of Kentucky, who sponsored the bill demanding the release of the Jeffrey Epstein files by the Justice Department.Greene, who had been a close ally of Trump for years, cited backlash from the president over her advocacy for the bill in her statement, saying that her last day in the House of Representatives will be Jan. 5. \"Marjorie 'Traitor' Brown, because of PLUMMETING Poll Numbers, and not wanting to face a Primary Challenger with a strong Trump Endorsement (where she would have no chance of winning!), has decided to call it 'quits' \" Trump wrote early Saturday in a Truth Social post.\"Her relationship with the WORST Republican Congressman in decades, Tom Massie of Kentucky, also known as Rand Paul Jr. because he votes against the Republican Party (and really good legislation!), did not help her,\" Trump said.\"For some reason, primarily that I refused to return her never ending barrage of phone calls, Marjorie went BAD,\" he wrote.\"Nevertheless, I will always appreciate Marjorie, and thank her for her service to our Country.\"Trump had opposed the bill ordering the release of the Epstein files until the last minute. This week, the bill passed the House in a nearly unanimous vote and passed the Senate unanimously. The president then signed it into law.Trump spoke with NBC News later Saturday morning about Greene, saying, \"It's not going to be easy\" for her to have a future in Republican politics.\"I would like to see it,\" Trump told NBC.\"She's got to take a little rest,\" he said.\"I can patch up differences with anyone,\" Trump said when asked if he believes he can reconcile with Greene.Trump last week said he would support \"the right person\" if they challenged Greene in the Republican primary next year for her seat representing Georgia's 14th District.In her resignation statement on Friday night, Greene wrote, \"I have too much self respect and dignity, love my family too much, and do not want my sweet  district to have to endure a hurtful and hateful primary against me by the President we all fought for, only to fight and win my election while  Republicans will likely lose the midterms.\"\"And in turn, be expected to defend the President against impeachment after he hatefully  dumped tens of millions of dollars against me and tried to destroy me,\"  Greene said.\"I refuse to be a 'battered wife' hoping it all goes away and  gets better.\"\"Standing  up for American women who were raped at 14, trafficked and used by rich powerful men, should not result in me being called a traitor and  threatened by the President of the United States of America, whom I fought for.\"",

    "body": "Ariana Grande and Cynthia Erivo star in Universal's \"Wicked: For Good.\"UniversalUniversal's \"Wicked: For Good\" defied gravity at the box office, snaring an estimated $150 million from domestic ticket sales.It marks the second-highest opening weekend for a film released in 2025, just behind Warner Bros.' \"A Minecraft Movie,\" which tallied $163 million back in April. It also outpaces the debut of last year's \"Wicked,\" which tallied $112.5 million in the U.S. and Canada.The film's haul sets the record for the biggest opening weekend of a Broadway adaptation. With additional ticket sales from international markets, \"Wicked: For Good\" is set to reach a $226 million global haul for its first three days in theaters.An estimated 10 million tickets were sold for \"Wicked: For Good\" during opening weekend, topping the 8 million sold during the opening of \"Wicked\" last year, according to data from EntTelligence. The box office data company also reported that 30% of domestic screenings were in premium large format theaters, up from 18% for \"Wicked.\" These tickets are more expensive than general admission and can help bolster blockbuster releases. EntTelligence noted that general tickets for \"Wicked: For Good\" averaged at around $15.25 each while tickets for premium screens averaged at $18.75 a piece.\"Team Universal did a fantastic job of following perfectly on the success of the original film a year ago and have parlayed that into an even bigger debut for this second installment,\" said Paul Dergarabedian, head of marketplace trends at Comscore. \"'Wicked: For Good' will look forward to incredibly strong playability throughout Thanksgiving week and beyond during the all-important holiday movie-going season.\"Last year, the combination of \"Wicked,\" Paramount's \"Gladiator II\" and Disney's \"Moana 2\" helped boost the Thanksgiving holiday box office to its highest haul ever. This year, \"Wicked: For Good\" is joined by Disney's \"Zootopia 2.\"The first \"Zootopia\" opened in 2016 to $75 million domestically but went on to gross more than $1 billion worldwide. Pent-up audience demand could push the film's three-day opening to around $100 million and the five-day Thanksgiving period to north of $125 million. \"The impressive expected over-performance by 'Wicked: For Good,' in combination with the other films in the marketplace, could give last year's record Thanksgiving literally a run for its money,\" Dergarabedian said. \"This is great news after all the negative stories about the challenging October box office drove the narrative.\" Disclosure: Comcast is the parent company of NBCUniversal, which owns CNBC. Versant would become the new parent company of CNBC upon Comcast's planned spinoff of Versant.",

    "body": "Amina AlTai has always been a high achiever.As a child of immigrants, she was told to \"keep your head down, work really hard, and if you do that, you'll have everything you want,\" she tells CNBC Make It.Her early career looked \"great on paper,\" she says: AlTai opened her own marketing agency in her late 20s, and says she was \"achieving all the milestones\" of success.At the same time, she was overworking herself to the point of illness, she says. One day, while driving to a client meeting, she got a call from her physician. \"My doctor called to say that if I don't go to the hospital now, instead of going to work, I'll be days away from multiple organ failure\" due to severe anemia, AlTai says.In hindsight, the moment was \"such a wake-up call,\" she says — but instead of heading straight for the hospital, AlTai first attended her client meeting.She says she was subsequently diagnosed with celiac disease and Hashimoto's thyroiditis, both of which were exacerbated by exhaustion.\"My workaholic tendencies and painful relationship to success were — quite literally — killing me,\" AlTai, now 41, wrote in her recent book, \"The Ambition Trap: How to Stop Chasing and Start Living.\"Today, AlTai is a leadership coach who teaches her clients how to protect their wellbeing and practice healthy ambition. \"So many of us are working ourselves into pain and suffering,\" she says — but it doesn't have to be that way. Here's her advice for building a healthy mindset around ambition.'Painful' versus 'purposeful' ambitionThough AlTai's unhealthy relationship with ambition caused her to \"crash and burn,\" she says, it doesn't mean that being driven is inherently a bad thing.\"I think ambition is neutral and natural,\" she says. She defines it as \"simply a desire for more life, a wish to grow, a wish to unfold.\"In AlTai's view, people tend to experience ambition in two ways, she says: \"painful\" ambition and \"purposeful\" ambition.Painful ambition, which AlTai defines as \"the voracious desire to advance, regardless of the cost,\" stems from a feeling of \"not-enoughness,\" she writes in \"The Ambition Trap.\" From a psychological perspective, painful ambition is based in emotional \"core wounds\" like rejection, abandonment, humiliation, betrayal and injustice, she says.\"If you build your ambition upon that, it's going to be a bit of a house of cards,\" AlTai says, \"because we're perpetually looking for the salve on the outside for the wound on the inside, and that never works.\"On the other hand, purposeful ambition \"comes from a place of wholeness,\" she says. People who practice purposeful ambition are driven by a desire to make a positive impact, AlTai says. They excel at collaborating with others, protect their needs and approach their mistakes with a growth mindset.Self-awareness is the key to turning painful ambition into purposeful ambition, according to AlTai. She encourages her clients to journal about their thought patterns without self-judgement, taking note when they fall into unhealthy mindsets.Habits for healthy ambitionIn order to stay in the zone of healthy ambition, one essential practice is \"honoring your energy,\" AlTai says. That means making time for the things that nourish you, from nutrition and exercise to spending time with loved ones.Without taking care of ourselves, \"it's really hard to show up fully,\" AlTai says. From a career standpoint, honoring your energy could mean designing your work week around the times you're most productive, taking walks in between meetings or blocking off certain times on your calendar to allow uninterrupted focus.Another important habit is to \"celebrate your wins,\" she says. As a leadership coach, AlTai noticed a pattern among many of her \"really ambitious\" clients: They were \"always moving the goalpost,\" she says.Instead of taking time to enjoy their successes, her clients immediately started working toward their next goal. That mindset makes it \"very tricky\" to feel satisfied with your accomplishments, according to AlTai.AlTai encourages taking time to rest after reaching a major milestone. \"In those quiet moments, you take inventory, you take stock, you see what worked, what you loved, what you didn't love, what you would do differently, and then you rise again,\" she says.Earn more and get ahead with CNBC's online courses.

Sean Rayford | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent said on Sunday the U.S. was not at risk of entering a recession in 2026 and claimed Americans would soon benefit from the Trump administration's economic policies on trade and taxes. \"I am very, very optimistic on 2026,\" Bessent said in an interview on NBC News' \"Meet the Press.\" \"We have set the table for a very strong, noninflationary growth economy.\" Parts of the GOP's massive spending package — the One Big, Beautiful Bill Act — are still going into effect and have yet to be felt in the economy, Bessent said. The new law makes permanent Trump's 2017 tax cuts, along with a senior \"bonus\" to offset Social Security taxes and a bigger state and local tax deduction. The plan also has tax breaks for tip income, overtime pay and auto loans.Health-care costs are also expected to become more affordable, Bessent added. The secretary said the Trump administration would have more news on that subject this week. For now, a congressional deadlock tied to the extension of enhanced subsidies on the Affordable Care Act marketplace is expected to push up health-care costs for millions of people. Bessent acknowledged that there are parts of the economy showing signs of struggle, including housing and interest-rate-sensitive sectors. He cited the services economy as contributing to inflation, claiming that lower energy prices will soon help to drive down prices.Kevin Hassett, the director of the White House National Economic Council, also said on Sunday that economic data from the fourth quarter could show weakness because of the government shutdown. The 43-day congressional stalemate in Washington, D.C., was the longest in U.S. history. Around two-thirds of registered voters say the Trump administration has fallen short on the economy and the cost of living, a recent NBC News poll found. Americans' views of the economy largely depend on their income level, according to JPMorgan's latest Cost of Living Survey.High-income respondents rated their confidence a 6.2 out of 10 — with 10 being the best — on average, the bank found. More than half of this cohort chose a rating between 7 and 10. In contrast, low-income consumers reported a 4.4 score on average. ",

    "body": "Short of a cash windfall, saving for a down payment on a home can take years — and in some U.S. states, it may take decades.A new analysis from ConsumerAffairs estimates how long it would take to save a 10% down payment in every state by comparing each state's median household income with its median home price, along with median tax burdens and essential living costs.In Iowa, it would take about 8.7 years to save enough for a 10% down payment, the fastest of any state. In California, the estimate is 25.1 years — longer than any other state. Across all 50 states, the average timeline is 14.4 years, according to the study.These timelines rely on what the study calls \"fractional saving,\" which assumes a household sets aside 10% of its discretionary income each year. That approach was chosen because \"that's how people really save,\" Dayna Edens, media relations manager at ConsumerAffairs, tells CNBC Make It. \"Nobody's setting aside every spare penny for a down payment on a house they're not even shopping for yet.\"A 10% down payment was also chosen over the commonly recommended 20% as a more realistic target for first-time buyers, says Edens.Here's a look at the 10 states where it would take the least amount of time to save up a 10% down payment on a home, based on each state's median income, median home price and estimated household savings.1. IowaTime to save: 8.7 yearsMedian annual household income: $75,501Median home price: $247,4002. OhioTime to save: 9.9 yearsMedian annual household income: $72,212Median home price: $261,7003. TexasTime to save: 10.3 yearsMedian annual household income: $79,721Median home price: $339,4004. MarylandTime to save: 10.3 yearsMedian annual household income: $102,905Median home price: $439,3005. North DakotaTime to save: 10.6 yearsMedian annual household income: $77,871Median home price: $298,2006. KansasTime to save: 10.6 yearsMedian annual household income: $75,514Median home price: $292,6007. OklahomaTime to save: 10.7 yearsMedian annual household income: $66,148Median home price: $252,9008. IllinoisTime to save: 10.7 yearsMedian annual household income: $83,211Median home price: $303,3009. AlaskaTime to save: 10.9 yearsMedian annual household income: $95,665Median home price: $402,80010. IndianaTime to save: 11.0 yearsMedian annual household income: $71,959Median home price: $276,000The key factor in affordability is home price. All but one of these states have median home prices below the national median of $410,800, per U.S. Census data.In eight of the 10 states, median household income is roughly in line with the national median of $83,730, per U.S. Census data. The shorter timelines largely reflect lower home prices, not unusually high earnings.That pattern holds in many higher-income states as well. In places where median household income exceeds six figures, such as California and Hawaii, the timelines tend to run longer than in states with lower-cost homes. In those states, high living costs, especially housing, can offset the advantage of higher wages.Annual taxes and essential expenses also influence how much discretionary income households can save. Tax burdens vary by roughly $15,000 from state to state, and the annual cost of necessities ranges from the mid-$20,000s to the low-$40,000s, according to the study.Earn more and get ahead with CNBC's online courses.

Grace Hie Yoon | Anadolu | Getty ImagesU.S. airlines are predicting another record Thanksgiving holiday travel period and are upbeat now that the travel-snarling government shutdown has ended.Airlines will carry more than 31 million people between Friday, Nov. 21, and Monday, Dec. 1, Airlines for America, a lobbying group representing the largest U.S. carriers, predicted Thursday. The busiest days are expected to be the Sunday after Thanksgiving, with about 3.4 million people flying, followed by the Monday after Thanksgiving, with around 3.1 passengers.Airline executives have expressed relief after the longest-ever government shutdown ended Nov. 12. Shortages of air traffic controllers, who were required to work without their regular pay, delayed and canceled flights, disrupting travel plans for some 6 million people, A4A said.The industry is now pushing lawmakers to pass legislation to ensure that air traffic controllers are paid in the case of another shutdown, with executives complaining in recent weeks about air travel becoming a political bargaining chip. The latest bill funds the government only through January, so industry members are hoping to avoid a repeat of the closure just before winter break and spring break seasons begin.Read more CNBC airline newsThe government shutdown is over.

Can it catch up?Bank of America estimated the big network airlines could see an operating income hit of $150 million to $200 million and smaller carriers would see an impact of $100 million because of the shutdown, but airlines haven't yet come out with revised estimates. Some travelers appeared to be waiting until the shutdown ended before booking their travel. United Airlines said bookings between Nov. 15 and Nov. 16 were up 16% compared with the prior weekend, when air travel disruptions spiked.The carrier also said bookings for international trips are at a record for the holiday period, up 10% over last year, with Cancun, Mexico, and major European hubs in London and Frankfurt, Germany, as top destinations.Overall, United forecast it will fly 6.6 million customers between Nov. 20 and Dec. 2., up more than 4% from last year.The largest U.S. carriers' international capacity is up about 5% between Nov. 26 and Nov. 30 compared with a similar period last year, according to aviation-data firm Cirium, while domestic capacity is about 2% higher.American Airlines said it plans to run 80,759 flights from Nov. 20 through Dec. 2., more than any airline.\"The Thanksgiving holiday period is one of the most condensed and most important for our customers — the stakes are high, and the American team is ready to deliver,\" American's Chief Operating Officer David Seymour said in a news release. Not all airlines have beefed up their schedules, however. Budget carrier Spirit Airlines, in its second bankruptcy in less than a year, has slashed capacity and furloughed hundreds of pilots to cut costs as it seeks to find more solid financial footing.Spirit's domestic flying capacity is down close to 40% from a year earlier, Cirium data shows.",

    "body": "It's natural to want to comfort a child when they're crying. When parents see their kid hurting physically or emotionally, they often want to do anything in their power to stop their heartache. As a dual certified child life specialist and therapist, I've heard parents and even health care workers telling kids \"don't cry\" while wiping away their tears during medical procedures and other difficult moments. It comes from a place of wanting to fix the hurt and make it all better. But it can make kids feel like their emotions and tears aren't okay, especially when they're in pain or distress. Instead, try to validate kids' feelings and help them feel safe and supported expressing their emotions and tears. Use these five alternatives:1. 'It's okay to cry, I'm here with you.'This helps kids know and believe that their experience is real and it's natural. Staying with kids through their stress conveys the message that their feelings don't scare you, that you can handle the difficult moments with them, and that they can rely on you for real-time support, even when it's hard or uncomfortable. 2. 'I see your tears.'You may not always know exactly why a child is crying or understand their reaction to the situation. Validation doesn't necessarily mean agreement; it means, \"I see you and I believe you.\" One way to validate their experience is to simply reflect back what you're seeing. Naming their emotion can be helpful for some kids, but for others it can be upsetting if your label doesn't match what they're truly feeling. Try naming their behaviors or using a more encompassing term such as \"upset.\"3. 'Your feelings make sense.'If kids hear, \"don't cry,\" they might interpret that their response doesn't match the situation, when in fact, it often does. We want kids to trust their feelings and to know that their tears make sense for what they're experiencing, whether it's pain, fear, or isolation. Sometimes the behaviors will be out of proportion with the situation, but the underlying feelings are never wrong. 4. 'It's natural to feel sad.'Parents often want their kids to feel happy, but it's natural to feel a range of emotions including difficult or uncomfortable ones. The goal is not to stop the emotion but to help kids acknowledge and manage it. Helping kids understand that crying is not bad — and that it's perfectly natural to feel sad, angry, lonely, or frustrated sometimes — reduces a sense of shame from any negative experiences. 5. 'Crying is one healthy way our bodies let feelings out.'Lastly, it's important for kids to understand that crying is a very healthy way to release emotions. Crying is coping and so is coloring, playing, talking, running, listening to music, and breathing. You can help kids try different strategies and find the ones that work best for them. Use tears as a chance to meet kids where they're at and help them work through challenges with confidence and connection. Kelsey Mora is a Certified Child Life Specialist and Licensed Clinical Professional Counselor who provides custom support, guidance, and resources to parents, families, and communities impacted by medical conditions, trauma, grief, and everyday life stress.

    "body": "Victoria Beckham, formerly Posh Spice of the Spice Girls, is known for her healthy habits and discipline when it comes to wellness.Since entering the spotlight three decades ago, the fashion designer's daily practices for peak health have evolved. While her diet remains consistent—fresh fish, vegetables, nuts, and seeds—her exercise routine and priorities have shifted now that she is in her 50s.Here are four ways Beckham's wellness routine has changed from the early 2000's to now.4 ways Victoria Beckham's wellness routine has changed1. She's more flexible with her diet\"I do try to be quite disciplined in the way that I eat,\" Beckham said on the BBC Radio program \"Gordon Ramsay's Perfect Christmas Lunch\" in 2006 at age 32.At the time, she prioritized a \"really healthy\" diet of fish, vegetables and fruit — and still does, she said. But these days Beckham is less rigid.\"I'm flexible with regards to food,\" Beckham told Net-a-Porter in 2020. \"My treat is a few glasses of red wine, and I also love tequila, and I do eat carbs. I have lots of avocado and really good fats, like salmon.\"2. She added weight training to her workoutsOver a decade ago, Beckham set a new year's resolution to start going to the gym, she told The Guardian in 2014. \"I've never stopped. Once I get into something, I do it properly,\" she said.Back then, she would exercise for 90 minutes with a trainer, attend SoulCycle classes and run often, sometimes for eight miles. By 2023, her workout routine looked much different.\"I usually workout every morning prior to beginning my day and recently incorporated strength training into my routine which has been a fun way to switch up my regime,\" Beckham said in an interview with Harper's Bazaar.The following year, she shared that weight training at 50 made her feel \"stronger than I did when I was 20.\"3. Sleep is key for her self care nowIn 2013, Beckham's three sons were still in school and her daughter was just one. Beckham started her days between 6:15 and 6:30 a.m., and would fall asleep sometime between midnight and 1 a.m., she told Harper's Bazaar that year.At the time, she was getting between five and six hours of sleep a night. \"I like to get as much sleep as I can. But when you're a mummy, you kind of—well, it would be nice,\" Beckham said.Ten years later, she told the publication that her best advice for self care was developing a healthy sleep routine.\"Creating healthy sleep habits is incredibly important; it's become a key part of my self-care practice,\" she said.\"I've been working on incorporating less screen time and more mindfulness into my routine, which means putting my phone away before bedtime.\"4. Wellness shots and green smoothies are a staple in her routineBeckham also gets plenty of nutrients and vitamins from her daily beverages.Earlier this year, Vogue covered Beckham's morning routine based on stories shared to her personal Instagram account. The first thing she consumes every morning is apple cider vinegar, \"a couple of tablespoons on an empty tummy,\" she said.Then, she and her husband David Beckham have their green smoothies which include:BroccoliSpinachCucumberCeleryAvocadoAppleGingerLemonAfter a workout, Beckham has another smoothie with berries, bananas, apples and almonds. She rounds out her morning with a wellness shot of lemon, black pepper, fresh ginger and turmeric. \"One shot a day!!\" she said.Earn more and get ahead with CNBC's online courses.

    "body": "Daniel Gray and his husband, Douglas, and their dog.Courtesy: Daniel GrayOn Oct. 23, the day after Daniel Gray's 56th birthday, he received an email that made him feel like he was dreaming: The U.S. Department of Education would forgive his more than $170,000 student loan balance.\"I could not believe it,\" Gray said. \"This is the first time I've been without debt since I'm 18.\"Yet the relief should not have been so surprising. Gray began paying his student loan debt in the 1990s and was eligible for the loan cancellation under the terms of his income-driven repayment plan. IDR plans lead to loan erasure after a certain period, typically 20 years or 25 years. But, like many borrowers, Gray was worried by reports that the relief was becoming harder to access under the Trump administration. \"Because of what's been going on, it was unclear whether they'd get forgiven,\" Gray said. Recently, many student loan borrowers have been left doubting if they'll get the loan cancellation to which they're entitled, said higher education expert Mark Kantrowitz. \"When borrowers worry about whether the Trump administration will renege on the student loan forgiveness promised by the federal government, it places them under extreme financial and emotional stress,\" Kantrowitz said. The U.S. Department of Education did not respond to a request for comment. Loan forgiveness becomes uncertain under Trump Earlier this year, the Education Department stopped forgiving the debt of borrowers in two long-standing student loan repayment plans, the Income-Contingent Repayment plan, or ICR, and the Pay As You Earn plan, or PAYE. It also temporarily paused debt forgiveness under the Income-Based Repayment plan, or IBR. More than 12 million student loan borrowers are enrolled in one of the Education Department's IDR plans, according to Kantrowitz.  But then, in October, there was a major victory for borrowers: The Trump administration agreed to resume clearing people's debts under ICR and PAYE, as a result of a lawsuit brought by the American Federation of Teachers. That same month, eligible borrowers enrolled in IBR also began to see their debts canceled again. The AFT contended that Trump officials were blocking borrowers from their rights mandated in their loan terms. \"We cannot say for sure, but it is possible that the AFT lawsuit prompted the discharge,\" said Weena Sanchez, a student loan counselor at the Education Debt Consumer Assistance Program in New York, a nonprofit, about Gray's student loan forgiveness. EDCAP worked with Gray on his request for the relief. Gray had earned the loan cancellation by May 2024, according to his loan forgiveness statement. \"We've heard of other clients receiving similar notices,\" Sanchez said.

The Trump administration announced this week that it will transfer much of the Education Department's programs to other agencies, a move experts say is part of President Donald Trump's directive to dismantle the agency. Education Department officials are also exploring options to sell portions of the $1.6 trillion federal student portfolio to the private market, Politico reported in October.A lifetime vow of poverty should not be part of the bargain. Mark Kantrowitz higher education expert Whatever changes lie ahead, it's important for borrowers to remember that the original terms of their student loans, spelled out in their Master Promissory Note, cannot change in the middle of repayment, Kantrowitz said. When borrowers signed that agreement, any programs that were in existence at the time, including repayment plans that conclude in loan forgiveness, must remain available to them, by law.Since student loans can't be discharged in normal bankruptcy proceedings, like other types of debt, borrowers \"depend on there being a light at the end of the tunnel,\" with the government's forgiveness, Kantrowitz said.\"When a low-income student is forced to borrow to pay for college, a lifetime vow of poverty should not be part of the bargain,\" he said. Student loan forgiveness 'the only way out' For some 30 years, Gray says his student loan debt weighed on him. He graduated in the mid-1990s from the University of California, Santa Barbara, with a degree in film studies and began working technical jobs in video and television production. But in the following years, he says, he grappled with substance abuse issues and clinical depression. As a result, his career took a hit, and Gray struggled to keep up with his monthly student loan payment, he said. Originally, he borrowed roughly around $30,000, but his balance steadily grew due to interest charges. \"This system is designed for students to graduate, get good jobs and start paying,\" Gray said. \"But what about for those of us who don't get our lives together until we are 37 or 38?\" By then, he said, his debt was already nearing six figures. By the time his debt was canceled by the government in October, his balance had spiraled to more than $170,000. \"I couldn't believe I had allowed it to get to this point; I felt incredibly guilty and ashamed,\" Gray said, but he also \"felt like the whole situation was engineered to take advantage of the borrower.\"  In 2011, Gray got a job offer at a television studio in Brazil. Frustrated with the cost of living in the U.S. and hoping for a major change, he made the move to São Paulo. He's lived in Brazil ever since. He met his now-husband, Douglas, a chef, there. The couple live close to the beach and take their dog for long walks every day.The biggest change Gray has felt since his student debt was wiped away is psychological: \"I suddenly feel like I can relax,\" he said. \"It's easy for people to say, 'Why don't people just pay them off? What's the big deal?\" Gray said, about his student loans. But he went on: \"It reached a point where it was beyond control. It seemed impossible. Student loan forgiveness is the only way out for a lot of people.\"",

    "body": "Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella speaks at Microsoft Build AI Day in Jakarta, Indonesia, on April 30, 2024.Adek Berry | AFP | Getty ImagesOn Microsoft's earnings call last month, CEO Satya Nadella boasted about the company's artificial intelligence products, and said over 150 million people are using its Copilot assistant for productivity, cybersecurity, coding and other endeavors.But conversations with IT buyers at Microsoft's Ignite conference in San Francisco this week highlighted some of the hurdles the company must overcome as it tries to sell its AI chatbot in the enterprise market.\"I know a lot of customers who are like, 'Yeah, I want 300 to go to zero,'\" said Adam Mansfield of consulting firm UpperEdge, referring to Copilot licenses. Mansfield, who helps companies negotiate Microsoft deals, said those clients are saying, \"I don't even want it.\"Microsoft started selling the commercial version of 365 Copilot two years ago for $30 per person per month, as an add-on to its broader productivity suite. The chatbot can answer a user's questions based on information stored in corporate systems and can run alongside Microsoft apps, summarizing email threads, creating formatted presentations and capturing key points from calls.Microsoft is competing in AI on multiple fronts, with its heftiest investment coming out of its Azure cloud infrastructure business. Alongside a $13 billion bet on OpenAI, Microsoft is the AI startup's key cloud provider. In October OpenAI announced a $250 billion commitment. Microsoft said revenue growth at Azure reached 40% in the latest quarter, topping the growth rate at Amazon Web Services and Google's cloud business. AI agents present a different challenge. Instead of paying for the infrastructure needed to run hefty workloads, customers are buying a new tool for their employees, and the return on that investment isn't yet clear, according to a number of clients and consultants interviewed by CNBC.  watch nowAdobe, Google, Salesforce, Workday and other vendors are also trying to sell agents to corporations, schools and governments, creating a crowded market for a still nascent technology. OpenAI and Anthropic not only have popular AI models but are increasingly catering to businesses with new services as well.Eon, a Sequoia-backed cloud backup startup, runs its software in Azure. CEO Ofir Ehrlich said Microsoft has broadened Azure's appeal for software developers and operations specialists. But the company isn't standardizing on Microsoft's AI software. It relies on AI coding tools from startups Cognition and Cursor and multiple AI assistants, said Ehrlich, who previously sold startup CloudEndure to Amazon.Google's Gemini has been making rapid advancements in the market. This week, the company debuted its latest model, Gemini 3, which it says will deliver better answers to more complex questions.\"We just had a massive 16,000-employee company move all their mail back to Google so they can leverage more Gemini,\" said Julian Hamood, founder of Microsoft partner TrustedTech.Microsoft declined to comment. More discounts?Hamood said one thing Microsoft could do is provide incentives to help companies and partners pay for data-cleaning projects that would make Copilot more valuable. Microsoft has offered some clients 50% off of the $30 list price for Copilot, he said. \"But they're starting to lean away from the Copilot discounts,\" Hamood said.Tim Crawford, a former IT executive who now advises chief information officers, said many customers aren't getting enough from Copilot to justify the cost. \"Am I getting $30 of value per user per month out of it?\" he said. \"The short answer is no, and that's what's been holding further adoption back.\"Starting in December, a Microsoft 365 Copilot Business tier will become available at $21 per person per month for organizations with up to 300 end users, the company announced at Ignite this week.It's not all doom and gloom for Copilot, as Microsoft still has an advantage with its expansive user base.Nadella said on the latest earnings call that \"more than 90% of the Fortune 500 now use Microsoft 365 Copilot,\" though he didn't provide an average number of users at those companies. He named five companies and a U.K. government department that each bought over 15,000 seats in the quarter, adding that most enterprise clients continued to come back for more.Land O'Lakes butter is displayed in a supermarket in New York on Feb. 15, 2017.Brendan Mcdermid | ReutersThis year, butter maker Land O'Lakes rolled out Microsoft 365 Copilot to all of its nearly 5,000 knowledge workers, after initially granting access to about 20% of them. A small number of employees also have Gemini subscriptions.Land O'Lakes has long relied on Microsoft software and now runs over 70% of its infrastructure in Azure, said Teddy Bekele, the company's technology chief, in an interview at Ignite.Software engineers at Land O'Lakes used the GitHub Copilot AI automated programming software to build custom project and portfolio management software, Bekele said, adding that the company stopped paying for an off-the-shelf product.Now Land O'Lakes is testing Oz, an assistant for retail agronomists who advise farmers. The company developed it with Microsoft Foundry software. Oz can save Land O'Lakes money as it replaces older applications, Bekele said.'Natural choice'Education publisher Pearson, meanwhile, has turned on Microsoft 365 Copilot for all of its 18,000 employees. The company uses Windows, Office and Azure products, as well as Amazon and Google cloud services, technology chief Dave Treat said at the conference. At Ignite, Pearson announced Communication Coach, an agent that will provide personalized learning recommendations through Copilot based on Teams calls, with help from OpenAI's GPT-4o mini model. \"Microsoft is dominant in the enterprise,\" Treat said. \"It was a natural choice if we're thinking about how to train people in communication in the workplace.\"Microsoft is also adding more models into the fold. On Tuesday, Microsoft said Anthropic is bringing its Claude Haiku 4.5, Opus 4.1 and Sonnet 4.5 to Microsoft Foundry. Anthropic committed to spend $30 billion on Azure.\"Before today, we didn't have access to all the models from Anthropic,\" Treat said. \"Now we do. That's a big improvement.\"Still, Mansfield said competition has intensified this year, and some companies have been more seriously evaluating alternatives to Microsoft's AI products.\"Microsoft is trying to catch up, quite honestly,\" Mansfield said. \"That's not what a monopoly typically has to do. They're not comfortable. Their sales reps actually now have to learn to sell.\"According to Microsoft, the technology is getting more traction internally. Around 70% of commercial sales, support and partner services workers now use Microsoft 365 Copilot daily, up from 20% a year ago, said Pam Maynard, the company's chief AI transformation officer. \"We've got the 30% daily active usage to get after,\" Maynard said in an interview. \"I do believe we'll get there, and it's just part of change management and helping people to develop that habit.\"WATCH: Microsoft CEO of commercial business on Anthropic, Nvidia partnershipwatch now",

    "body": "Living alone with a $2,000 housing budget may be nearly impossible in some major cities — but in others you may be able to afford up to three bedrooms.Across the U.S., the average rent for a studio apartment listed on Apartments.com in October was $1,699 a month, and a two-bedroom space had an average rent of $1,887 per month, according to data collected and analyzed by Apartments.com in a November report. Of the 25 most populous cities in the U.S., New York, Boston and California cities San Francisco, San Diego and San Jose were the most expensive. Average rent for a studio apartment in these cities was over $2,000 in October, according to data from Apartments.com shared with CNBC Make It.With $2,000, you could get an average of 267 square feet in New York City, or one-third the size of a pickleball court, according to a normalized estimate from October listings. Compare that with Oklahoma City, the most affordable of the most populous cities, where $2,000 is worth about 1,900 square feet — more than two pickleball courts. While this data offers a useful benchmark for comparison across cities, it isn't necessarily indicative of the size of any single apartment a renter is likely to encounter. In reality, apartment sizes and prices can differ within the same city due to various factors, and renters should keep that in mind, the authors of the report said.Here's where $2,000 in rent would get you the least space in the 25 most populous cities in America:New York, N.Y.: 267 square feetBoston, Mass.: 336 square feetSan Francisco, Calif.: 340 square feetSan Diego, Calif.: 458 square feetSan Jose, Calif.: 427 square feetHere's where $2,000 in rent would get you the most space in the 25 most populous cities in America: Oklahoma City, Okla.: 1,900 square feetEl Paso, Texas: 1,762 square feetIndianapolis, Ind.: 1,676 square feetColumbus, Ohio: 1,633 square feetSan Antonio, Texas: 1,517 square feetHere's how much space you could get for $2,000 a month in all 25 of the most populous U.S. cities as of October.New York, N.Y.Unit type: N/A Average size for $2,000: 267 square feetLos Angeles, Calif.Unit type: StudioAverage size for $2,000: 530 square feetChicago, Ill.Unit type: One bedroomAverage size for $2,000: 679 square feetHouston, TexasUnit type: Three bedroomAverage size for $2,000: 1,443 square feetPhoenix, Ariz.Unit type: Two bedroomAverage size for $2,000: 1,230 square feetPhiladelphia, Pa.Unit type: One bedroomAverage size for $2,000: 772 square feetSan Antonio, TexasUnit type: Three BedroomAverage size for $2,000: 1,517 square feetSan Diego, Calif.Unit type: N/AAverage size for $2,000: 458 square feetDallas, TexasUnit type: Two bedroomAverage size for $2,000: 1,154 square feetJacksonville, Fla.Unit type: Three bedroomAverage size for $2,000: 1,453 square feetFort Worth, TexasUnit type: Three bedroomAverage size for $2,000: 1,305 square feetSan Jose, Calif.Unit type: N/AAverage size for $2,000: 427 square feetAustin, TexasUnit type: Two bedroomAverage size for $2,000: 1,186 square feetCharlotte, N.C.Unit type: Two bedroomAverage size for $2,000: 1,235 square feetColumbus, OhioUnit type: Three bedroomAverage size for $2,000: 1,633 square feetIndianapolis, Ind.Unit type: Three bedroomAverage size for $2,000: 1,676 square feetSan Francisco, Calif.Unit type: N/AAverage size for $2,000: 340 square feetSeattle, Wash.Unit type: StudioAverage size for $2,000: 534 square feetDenver, Colo.Unit type: One bedroomAverage size for $2,000: 852 square feetOklahoma City, Okla.Unit type: Three bedroomAverage size for $2,000: 1,900 square feetNashville, Tenn.Unit type: One bedroomAverage size for $2,000: 863 square feetWashington, D.C.Unit type: StudioAverage size for $2,000: 512 square feetEl Paso, TexasUnit type: Three bedroomAverage size for $2,000: 1,762 square feetLas Vegas, Nev.Unit type: Three bedroomAverage size for $2,000: 1,354 square feetBoston, Mass.",

    "body": "Signage at the Microsoft campus in Mountain View, California, US, on Thursday, Oct. 23, 2025. Benjamin Fanjoy | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesConcerns about the steep valuations of artificial intelligence (AI) stocks and a questionable outlook for an interest rate cut in December weighed on investor sentiment in recent trading sessions. For now, however, Nvidia's solid earnings last week seemed to undermine the idea that everything tied to AI investment is in a bubble.Investors looking to capitalize on the recent selloff and pick up some attractive stocks for the long term can track the recommendations of top Wall Street analysts. These experts can help provide key insights into a company's growth potential.Here are three stocks favored by the Street's top pros, according to TipRanks, a platform that ranks analysts based on their past performance.MicrosoftWindows and Xbox owner Microsoft (MSFT) is viewed as one of the major beneficiaries of the AI boom. Last month, the company reported better-than-expected results in its fiscal first quarter, with revenue from the Azure cloud business growing by 40%.Recently, Baird analyst William Power initiated coverage on Microsoft with a buy rating and a price target of $600. TipRanks' AI Analyst is also optimistic on MSFT, giving it an \"outperform\" rating and a price target of $628.\"Microsoft is leading the AI revolution with infrastructure and applications, aided by its OpenAI relationship, providing an end-to-end AI platform for enterprises and consumers alike,\" said Power, explaining his optimism.Power sees MSFT's partnership with ChatGPT parent OpenAI as a key differentiator, helping it run AI at scale and speed. The 5-star analyst said that after a commitment to invest $13 billion, Microsoft recently announced an incremental $250 billion Azure investment over several years.The analyst discussed the impressive growth in MSFT's total revenue and Azure business in the September quarter, with the cloud business now constituting 60% of the overall top line. Power also highlighted the strength in Microsoft's core applications, including Microsoft 365, LinkedIn and Dynamics. He noted that MSFT's revenue growth in Q1 FY26 was accompanied by a solid operating margin of 49% and free cash flow margin of 33%. Microsoft's strong margins are ensuring continued double-digit EPS growth, he said.Power believes in Microsoft's near- and long-term potential, despite any immediate pressure stemming from AI capital spending concerns.Power ranks No. 287 among more than 10,100 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been successful 57% of the time, delivering an average return of 17%. See Microsoft Ownership Structure on TipRanks.Booking HoldingsOnline travel agent (OTA) Booking Holdings (BKNG) is another pick this week. The Priceline and Kayak owner posted impressive third-quarter results, with double-digit gains in gross bookings and revenue.Impressed by the Q3 performance and attractive valuation, Wedbush analyst Scott Devitt upgraded BKNG to buy from hold with a price targe of $6,000. By comparison, TipRanks' AI Analyst has a \"neutral\" rating on Booking Holdings with a price target of $5,406.\"Booking remains the best-positioned OTA in our view,\" benefiting from several positives, from the company's scale and diversification to solid liquidity to free cash flow conversion, Devitt said.The top-rated analyst also noted management's impressive history of successfully executing major strategic initiatives. Devitt highlighted Booking Holdings' widening market share in alternative lodging while optimizing costs and driving efficiencies. The company's cost savings are supporting reinvestment in growth initiatives to achieve longer-term targets, he said.Additionally, Devitt discussed Booking's impressive growth across key metrics in the third quarter amid better-than-anticipated global travel demand. Third-quarter gross bookings growth of 14% surpassed management's guidance by 400 basis points, the analyst said. ASs a result, Devitt raised his 2025 gross bookings growth estimate by 100 basis points from his prior forecast, to 11.5%. Further, he expects BKNG to report adjusted EBITDA of $9.8 billion, reflecting year-over-year margin expansion of about 180 basis points.Devitt ranks No. 660 among more than 10,100 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been profitable 50% of the time, delivering an average return of 12.3%. See Booking Holdings Financials on TipRanks. DoorDashDevitt also upgraded his rating for food delivery platform DoorDash (DASH) to buy from hold with a price target of $260. TipRanks' AI Analyst rates DoorDash \"neutral\" with a price target of $211. DASH shares took a hit when the company announced mixed third-quarter results and said it expects to spend \"several hundred million dollars\" on new initiatives and development in 2026.Devitt believes that the pullback in DASH shares presents an attractive risk/reward opportunity, with the stock now trading at about 17.7x his 2027 adjusted EBITDA estimate. The Wedbush analyst noted that the post earnings selloff was mainly due to concerns about the level of capital spending and pressured profit margins.Devitt admits that the higher level of spending will hurt near-term margins, but argues such investments in growth initiatives are warranted given that they'll expand DASH's addressable market and bolster its product offerings.Specifically, Devitt highlighted management's plans to direct incremental investments toward three key areas: \"(1) creating a cohesive global tech platform, (2) building new verticals and products, and (3) scaling geographic expansion.\"Overall, Devitt is bullish on DoorDash, believing it has held a dominant position in the U.S. food delivery sector. Moreover, he noted the company's solid execution across strategic initiatives as management pushes for long-term sustainable growth. See DoorDash Hedge Fund Activity on TipRanks. ",

    "body": "An operator for Baker Hughes conducts a wireline survey on a Chesapeake Energy natural gas rig in the North Texas Barnett Shale near Burleson, Texas.Matt Nager | Getty ImagesCompany: Baker Hughes (BKR)Business: Baker Hughes is an energy technology company with a portfolio of technologies and services that span the energy and industrial value chain. The company operates in two segments: oilfield services and equipment and industrial and energy technology. The OFSE segment provides products and services for onshore and offshore oilfield operations across the lifecycle of a well, ranging from exploration, appraisal, and development, to production, rejuvenation, and decommissioning. OFSE is organized into four product lines: well construction; completions, intervention and seasurements; production solutions and subsea and surface pressure systems. The IET segment provides technology solutions and services for mechanical-drive, compression and power-generation applications across the energy industry, including oil and gas, liquefied natural gas operations, downstream refining and petrochemical markets, as well as lower carbon solutions to broader energy and industrial sectors.Stock Market Value: $47.84 billion ($48.48 per share)Activist: Ananym Capital ManagementOwnership: n/aAverage Cost: n/aActivist Commentary: Ananym Capital Management is a New York-based activist investment firm which launched on Sept. 3, 2024, and is run by Charlie Penner (a former partner at JANA Partners and head of shareholder activism at Engine No. 1) and Alex Silver (a former partner and investment committee member at P2 Capital Partners). Ananym looks for high quality but undervalued companies, regardless of industry. They would prefer to work amicably with their portfolio companies but are willing to resort to a proxy fight as a last resort. According to their most recent 13F filing, they manage $260 million across 10 positions.What's happeningOn Oct. 21, Ananym Capital announced that they have taken a position in Baker Hughes and are calling on the company to spin out its oilfield services and equipment business, arguing such a step could help push up the stock price by at least 60%.Behind the scenesBaker Hughes is a leading provider of energy and industrial technology services. The company was formed through the 2017 merger of legacy Baker Hughes and GE Oil & Gas, combining best-in-class intellectual property shared by GE spinoff assets and the technical expertise from both organizations. The company operates through two primary segments: industrial and energy technologies and oilfield services and Equipment. The IET unit (55% of projected 2025 revenue and 60% of projected 2025 EBITDA) is a long-cycle industrial and energy business focused on gas technology equipment, including turbines and compressors, and aftermarket services, including new energy applications. The OFSE unit (45%/40%) is a short-cycle oilfield equipment and production services business with an end-to-end portfolio of oilfield services and equipment for well construction and production.Management has built up a strong track record of effective execution, and that success has been reflected in the share price, with the company delivering strong returns of 28.26%, 75.29% and 232.98% over the past 1-, 3- and 5-year periods, respectively. Within IET, the company has taken advantage of its leading position in LNG, in which Baker now has 95% global footprint for the turbomachinery required in plant construction, a market that is expected to grow at a 10% compound annual growth rate through 2030. Additionally, the company has a strong position in power generation, as Baker is one of few original equipment manufacturers supplying smaller-scale turbines and complete behind-the-meter power solutions. These offerings have allowed the company to play a pivotal role in helping to address rapidly growing data center demand, as its data center orders have gone from $0 to $550 million in just two quarters. As such, management is heavily investing in this opportunity — developing larger-scale power systems to support mega-data center deployments. Furthermore, Baker's pending acquisition of Chart Industries is expected to further strengthen IET's position in power, LNG, and industrials. As a result, IET is approaching a 20% EBITDA margin, with further margin expansion expected as the business mix continues to shift toward aftermarket services, which generate long-term recurring revenue streams supported by contracts exceeding 10 years and margins of 35% or more. For OFSE, management has taken steps to meaningfully improve the segment's earnings mix and reduce its cyclical commodity exposure. This includes exiting or downsizing non-core ventures and low-margin product lines, such as its surface pressure control joint venture with Cactus; prioritizing the Middle East and international markets (now 75% of OFSE revenue), which are less correlated to commodity prices; and implementing strong pricing discipline and cost cutting measures by enforcing minimum margin thresholds on new contracts, consolidating product lines and simplifying reporting. However, despite these efforts, OFSE remains highly subject to commodity volatility, affecting both the segment's performance and the company's overall valuation. Currently valued at about 9x EBITDA, Baker trades more closely with oilfield services peers (6–7x EBITDA), than its industrial and energy technology peers (16–18x), despite IET being the majority of the company's revenue and EBITDA. An implied sum-of-the-parts multiple for Baker would put the company at approximately 13x. It is for this reason that Ananym has launched a campaign at Baker calling for the company to either continue growing IET relative to OFSE or to pursue a sale or spin of OFSE. Ananym believes that a potential separation could result in an about 51% immediate upside through realizing Baker's sum of parts valuation, even when assuming $100 million dis-synergies from separation. Moreover, this upside does not reflect much of the potential long-term growth tailwinds and margin expansion expected from these ongoing operational initiatives — value drivers that shareholders should also be better positioned to realize through such a move.Founded in September 2024, this is Ananym's third public activist campaign. Knowing Charlie Penner and Alex Silver as we do, we would expect them to strive to work amicably with management to create value for shareholders. As such, they have already expressed full confidence in management to choose the optimal path forward, and the company's strong operational track record fully supports that confidence. Moreover, on Oct. 6, the company announced a review of its capital allocation, business, cost structure, and operations. With all signs pointing towards alignment between the two parties, we do not expect that they will insist on, or even ask for, board representation or continue to engage in much more of a public campaign. Rather, we expect them to work amicably with Baker behind the scenes to unlock meaningful shareholder value. However, this cooperative approach should not be confused for weakness, as they are fiduciaries to their own investors and will do whatever is necessary to create value at their portfolio companies. Thus, should management fail to act decisively, Ananym could quickly shift to a more assertive stance.Ken Squire is the founder and president of 13D Monitor, an institutional research service on shareholder activism, and the founder and portfolio manager of the 13D Activist Fund, a mutual fund that invests in a portfolio of activist investments.",

Sia Kambou | Afp | Getty ImagesChinese business dealings in Africa, once dominated by state-owned enterprises, are now increasingly shifting toward consumer products from the private sector.While Africa's faster-growing economies, such as Kenya, Uganda and Zambia, see annual growth rates of 4.8%, 6.4% and 5.8%, respectively, the GDP of the overall continent's 50-plus countries is 4.1%. That is according to IMF's economic outlook report last month. Chinese investments in Africa's resource-intensive sectors have declined by roughly 40% since their 2015 peak, amid weaker returns and falling construction revenues in traditional commodity industries, according to Rhodium Group China Cross-Border Monitor released on Nov. 18 this year. Meanwhile, China's exports to Africa have surged by 28% year-on-year over the first three quarters of 2025, following a 57% increase from 2020 to 2024, the report said. Most of those products are higher-value-added manufactured goods such as electronics, plastics and textiles. \"In the early days, Chinese companies that went over were doing a lot more infrastructure, and they were also doing a lot of the natural minerals mining,\" said Joe Ngai, chairman of McKinsey Greater China.\"In the last few years, I think people are trying to think of the African consumer market,\" he said. But he cautioned that market fragmentation and thin margins can make these ventures difficult. The shift comes as the first G20 summit ever held on the continent kicked off over the weekend in South Africa. While the U.S. only sent its acting ambassador, Chinese Premier Li Qiang represented Beijing, creating more high-level opportunities for business discussions. watch nowIn contrast to prior years when people in China didn't know much about what was happening in Africa, today there are \"more business trips, sending more employees overseas. It just feels more involved,\" said Heather Li, founder and China-Africa consultant at The Dot Connector. She noted that, increasingly, larger Chinese companies are sending decision-makers to Africa to explore specific market opportunities.Due to power shortages in West Africa, Li said Chinese solar products are welcomed there, while medical supplies, along with baby and household products, are also popular across the continent.Already, Chinese smartphone company Transsion has built its business in Africa over the years, while telecoms giant Huawei and household appliance company Midea have also expanded in Africa.In July, Chinese state media reported that the Midea group signed an agreement with the Confederation of African Football, which will increase investments in the area. The company has already built factories in Egypt and has plans for more. Growing Chinese social media attentionThe evolving landscape is evident not only in investment data but also in experiences shared by Chinese entrepreneurs online. On social media platforms like Xiaohongshu and Bilibili, posts over the past year portray Africa as an emerging destination for smaller, agile business ventures spanning dropshipping and e-commerce, as well as manufacturing and retail tied to Chinese supply chains.One earphone and data-cable trader described relocating from China to Nigeria and his search for African partners, while another social media account documented the progress of a business owner's bubble tea business in Kenya. The social media posts also show entrepreneurs selling slippers, small appliances, furniture, and press-on nails. Joseph Keshi, a Nigerian-born real estate investor and business strategist who has worked closely with Chinese entrepreneurs, said some of them earned as much as six-figure U.S. dollars in their first year. While Li cautioned that some might be exaggerating on social media, she noted that the exposure might amplify Chinese awareness of the opportunities in Africa.Euromonitor data affirmed the trend is happening on a larger scale — highlighting how many Chinese ventures in Africa sell basic consumer goods such as diapers, household items, packaged sauces and snacks. \"With a rapidly urbanizing, youthful, and increasingly connected population, household spending across the continent is projected to exceed US$2 trillion by 2030,\" Christy Tawii, regional insight manager at Euromonitor International, said in a statement.She also pointed to the rise of e-commerce platforms such as Chinese Supermarket, which expand the reach of Asian and Chinese brands to African households. Many of these entrepreneurs are optimistic that greater use of the Chinese yuan in Africa could lower transaction risks and deepen commercial ties. Currently, the Chinese yuan is used in \"30% of trade invoicing,\" according to Rhodium's report. But Rhodium Group and Atlantic Council say there's a \"structural ceiling\" to increased use of the Chinese yuan, citing China's trade surplus with most of its African partners and the global reliance on the U.S. dollar. Exports-only pitfallsThe rise of Chinese consumer businesses' interest in Africa comes as profit margins narrow at home due to slowing economic growth and intense competition.Selling to Africa's consumers also becomes more attractive to Chinese companies as they face trade barriers with the U.S. and Europe, Rhodium Group pointed out. The analysts laid out a \"stagnation scenario\" in which Chinese exports increasingly flow to regions such as Africa if China fails to resolve its overcapacity issues and faces further restrictions in Europe.While cheap imports benefit consumers, in Africa as in other parts of the world, a surge of low-cost exports can undermine local manufacturing and deepen trade imbalances. \"It'll be necessary to see Africa as not just a consumer market, but as a market that produces the goods that the continent itself will consume,\" said Ebipere Clark, visiting fellow and consultant at the African Policy Research Institute.Some Chinese companies are already starting to produce locally. \"There is more push for industrialization in Africa,\" The Dot Connector's Li said. \"I was involved in some consulting projects to attract Chinese light industries to move the manufacturing in Africa, and they also have priority access to U.S. and Europe markets.\"Guangzhou-based trading company Sunda International sells a range of products from agricultural tools to daily consumer goods, and claims to have ramped up its construction of more than 20 production centers in Africa over the last decade.Sunda reportedly earns up to $450 million annually by supplying Africa's necessity markets such as baby diapers and sanitary pads.Several of Sunda's listed factories are in Zambia. That's where Premier Li last week signed a $1.4 billion agreement to modernize a railway linking the country to the Indian Ocean with the aim of significantly expanding freight volumes.",

    "body": "Homes in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida, US, on Sunday, Jan. 11, 2026. Zak Bennett | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesMortgage demand spiked markedly higher last week as consumers returned from the holidays to find overall lower interest rates and then a sharp rate drop Friday on news from the White House. President Donald Trump posted on social media late Thursday that, in an effort to lower mortgage rates, he would order mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to buy $200 billion in mortgage-backed bonds. Just on that news, the average rate on the 30-year fixed sunk briefly below 6% Friday morning before bouncing slightly higher again, according to Mortgage News Daily. As a result, total mortgage application volume jumped 28.5% last week from the previous week, which was adjusted for the holiday, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association's (MBA) seasonally adjusted index. For the whole week, on the MBA's survey, the average contract interest rate for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages with conforming loan balances, $832,750 or less, decreased to 6.18% from 6.25%, with points decreasing to 0.56 from 0.57, including the origination fee, for loans with a 20% down payment. \"Rates started to come down a little just before that, and part of it might be a bounce back from the holidays, even though we did adjust for the holiday in the results the week before. It's always a noisy time,\" said Joel Kan, an MBA economist, adding, \"This was a real move based upon the rate drop. Spreads had been moving in even before the announcement.\"Refinance demand, which is most sensitive to daily rate changes, surged 40% higher for the week and was 128% higher than the same week one year ago. Get Property Play directly to your inboxCNBC's Property Play with Diana Olick covers new and evolving opportunities for the real estate investor, delivered weekly to your inbox.Subscribe here to get access today.\"The average loan size for refinance applications was also higher, as borrowers with larger loan sizes are typically more sensitive to changes in rates,\" Kan added.  Applications for a mortgage to purchase a home, which are less sensitive to sudden rate changes,  increased 16% for the week and were 13% higher than the same week one year ago. The increase there was probably driven more just by people returning from the holidays, easing home prices and more inventory available for sale.Mortgage rates moved higher to start this week, according to Mortgage News Daily. They bounced Monday on the expectation of higher oil prices and then a little higher Tuesday. \"Things might have ended up worse today had it not been for a reasonably well-received CPI report (Consumer Price Index),\" wrote Matthew Graham, COO of Mortgage News Daily on Tuesday. \"This important data showed inflation remaining in check in December, with the most closely-watched metrics coming in just below the median forecast.\"",

    "body": "Shoppers walk outside the Saks Fifth Avenue flagship store in Manhattan in New York City, U.S., Jan. 6, 2026. Angelina Katsanis | ReutersSaks Global, the parent company behind the 159-year-old department store that's become both a destination and a symbol for luxury fashion, filed for bankruptcy protection after running out of cash and failing to find investors willing to finance its business. Crucially, the retailer filed for Chapter 11, which will give it the chance to reorganize its business, clear through its debts and potentially find a buyer willing to take it on as a going concern. The company announced Wednesday that former Neiman Marcus CEO Geoffroy van Raemdonck will immediately take over as chief executive, replacing Richard Baker, who had been in the job for just two weeks.Saks also announced it had secured a financing commitment of around $1.75 billion in a bid to strengthen its balance sheet.As recently as last week, Saks was having trouble lining up as much as $1 billion in financing for a so-called debtor-in-possession loan, which provides the funds to keep a business running during Chapter 11 proceedings, CNBC previously reported. If Saks hadn't lined up the DIP loan, it made a Chapter 7 liquidation filing more likely. A bankruptcy filing for Saks Global has been seen as inevitable for weeks after the company missed an interest payment to bondholders late last month. What is still unclear is what will happen to the company and the nearly 200 doors under its umbrella across Saks' namesake stores and its off-price chain, along with Neiman Marcus and Bergdorf Goodman. Bankruptcy proceedings could lead to a range of potential outcomes. A deep-pocketed strategic buyer could swoop in and buy the whole company, saving it from liquidation. Saks could also liquidate while other parts of its business sell, such as the smaller Neiman and Bergdorf. Like its erstwhile competitor Lord & Taylor, Saks, Neiman and Bergdorf — or some combination of the three — could close all of their stores and become online-only businesses.The future of Saks Global will become clearer in the coming weeks as bankruptcy proceedings play out and the company continues to look for new investors. How did Saks fall apart? Though it caters to some of the wealthiest shoppers in the world, Saks has been steadily running out of cash and failing to pay some of its bills after it acquired its longtime rival Neiman Marcus in 2024 in a $2.7 billion deal heavily financed with debt. Still, Saks was struggling to pay its vendors even before it acquired Neiman. Through the acquisition, the company received a flood of new money that was supposed to deleverage the combined business and provide it with \"significant liquidity,\" Saks said at the time. The tie up brought a fresh slate of deep-pocketed investors from the tech world, including Amazon and Salesforce, and was expected to create a luxury department store powerhouse with an improved cost structure and stronger negotiating power. Instead, Saks failed to implement the turnaround investors had banked on. It briefly got better at paying its vendors, but then moved to a 90-day payment term, angering and pushing away brands that said the conditions were too onerous to work for their businesses. Soon, it stopped paying suppliers once again, which led to both a dip in assortment and sales. In the backdrop, Saks' debt began trading below its face value, raising questions about the company's ability to keep operations running and make interest payments to bondholders, people familiar with the matter said. Over the summer, it secured $600 million in new financing and sold off key real estate assets to drum up more cash.While those efforts bought the company some time, they ultimately didn't prevent a bankruptcy filing.",

    "body": "President Donald Trump speaks at the Detroit Economic Club in Detroit, Jan. 13, 2026.Evelyn Hockstein | ReutersAs the Justice Department continues its investigation into the Federal Reserve, the next front in the central bank's quest to maintain political independence shifts to the Supreme Court. On Jan. 21, the high court will hear arguments related to President Donald Trump's efforts to fire Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook.Administration officials last year accused Cook of committing mortgage fraud by misrepresenting which property was her primary residence on mortgage applications. Trump tried to remove Cook from her position but thus far has been prevented by courts. Should the White House win the case, it could set an important precedent for the president's ongoing attempt to oust Fed Chair Jerome Powell.\"If the Court rules against Cook, that would significantly raise the probability that Powell could also be removed based on the DoJ investigation,\" Bank of America economist Aditya Bhave said in a note. \"We have been arguing that the Cook case is more important for the policy trajectory than the identity of the next Fed Chair. We think that's even more true now.\"The stakes were raised in the Fed saga when Powell announced Sunday that he'd been served with Justice Department subpoenas regarding a controversial multimillion-dollar renovation project at the central bank's headquarters in Washington. The probe reportedly focuses on whether Powell lied about the project during congressional testimony last year.Trump has been a fierce Powell critic and toyed last year with the idea of firing him. Powell has insisted that Trump can't remove him, but if the president can establish cause, that could change. On the surface, the effort to remove Powell seems academic: His term as chair expires in May and Trump then is free to submit a new nominee. However, Powell's term on the Board of Governors runs into 2028, meaning he could stay on and be an obstacle to Trump's efforts to get the Fed to lower rates \"MEANINGFULLY!!!,\" as he stated in a social media post Tuesday.However, it also could provide further incentive for Powell to serve out his term on the board as a bulwark against Trump's efforts to thwart the Fed's independence from political manipulation. For his part, Powell has mostly resisted commenting on Trump's criticism, which has been intensely personal and biting at times. While other presidents have tried to coerce the Fed into easing policy, Trump stands alone in how public and aggressive he has been. Moreover, this is the first time the Justice Department ever has gone after a sitting Fed chair.Longer-term consequencesThe circumstances could add up to a prolonged battle in which Powell decides to stay on, several analysts say.Deutsche Bank drew parallels between Powell and former Fed Chair Marriner Eccles — whose name is now on a Fed building — who decided to stay on as governor after President Harry Truman removed him in 1948. Eccles stayed on as governor until 1951 and was a voice in favor of central bank independence.Moreover, a revolt within the Federal Open Market Committee, which sets interest rates for the Fed, even could see Powell maintained as chair though Trump could name a separate chair to run the central bank itself.\"While this was never a base case, and indeed it seemed like a relatively remote possibility, this weekend's events likely increase the probability that Powell could choose to remain at the Fed,\" Deutsche Bank chief U.S. economist Matthew Luzzetti said in a client note. \"Indeed, if the administration insists on following through with a criminal prosecution of Chair Powell, and Senate Republicans stand firm in not advancing nominees to the Federal Reserve Board, it is likely the FOMC would choose Powell to remain on as chair.\"That circles back to the Cook hearing. Should Trump prevail, he could use it as justification to remove Powell. Should Cook win, it sets up a protracted battle of wills between the Fed and White House that could have important policy implications.Markets are watching for clues about the Fed's moves, with traders betting heavily against any action at the policy meeting later this month. Instead, they see the next cut not coming until June, according to CME Group data.The Cook decision \"will carry immense weight when it comes to any president's ability to shape the structure of the Fed,\" wrote Kevin Gordon, head of macro research and strategy at Charles Schwab. \"Make no mistake, though: Even though the magnitude of various markets' moves in response to the Powell news has been limited, the direction (dollar down, stocks down, bonds down) is indicative of how these shocks are to be digested if they persist over the long term.\"",

Here's what the company reported:Earnings: 98 cents a share vs. 96 cents estimate of analysts surveyed by LSEG  Revenue: $28.53 billion vs. expected $27.94 billionThe company said profit rose 12% to $7.6 billion, or 98 cents per share, from a year earlier. Revenue rose 7.1% to $28.53 billion, thanks to rising net interest income, asset management fees and trading revenue.Shares of the bank climbed about 1% in premarket trading. \"With consumers and businesses proving resilient, as well as the regulatory environment and tax and trade policies coming into sharper focus, we expect further economic growth in the year ahead,\" CEO Brian Moynihan said in the release. \"While any number of risks continue, we are bullish on the U.S. economy in 2026.\"Net interest income, which is the difference in what a bank earns on loans and securities and what it pays depositors for their savings, rose 9.7% to $15.92 billion in the quarter. That is roughly $240 million more than what analysts had expected, per StreetAccount.Equities trading revenue rose 23% to $2.02 billion, or about $160 million more than expected. Fixed income trading revenue edged up by 1.5% to $2.52 billion, or about $120 million below what analysts had forecasted for the quarter.Fees generated by the firm's investment bankers were roughly flat from a year ago at $1.67 billion, nearly matching the StreetAccount estimate.The lender got a boost from a smaller-than-expected provision for loan losses in the quarter of $1.31 billion, about $190 million lower than analysts had forecast. Bank of America, the second-largest U.S. bank by assets after JPMorgan Chase, has been a beneficiary of the industry's recent tailwinds. Falling interest rates, rising Wall Street trading and advisory fees, stable consumer credit and deregulation have all helped the lender, whose shares rose 24% last year.Analysts will want to hear more from Moynihan as to whether momentum will carry into 2026.On Tuesday, JPMorgan posted results that exceeded expectations on better-than-expected trading revenue.

    "body": "Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg demonstrates an Oculus Rift virtual reality (VR) headset and Oculus Touch controllers during the Oculus Connect 3 event in San Jose, California, U.S., on Thursday, Oct. 6, 2016.David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesA little over four years after Mark Zuckerberg changed Facebook's name to Meta, reflecting his view that the future of work, play and socializing was going virtual, the company is making a major course correction. Meta this week began laying off employees focused on virtual reality within its Reality Labs division and is shutting down a number of studios that were working on VR titles, according to people familiar with the matter who asked not to be named due to confidentiality. CNBC confirmed a report from the New York Times that layoffs, amounting to more than 1,000 jobs, will impact about 10% of the hardware division, which makes Quest VR headsets, and the Horizon Worlds virtual social network. Andrew Bosworth, Meta's chief technology officer, is slated to hold an all-hands meeting with Reality Labs on Wednesday, some of the people said.Meta is scaling back its metaverse ambitions as the company continues ramping up its investments in artificial intelligence, Zuckerberg's more recent obsession and the technology that's consumed Silicon Valley and the broader industry. Zuckerberg has been paying big bucks for top AI talent, most notably shelling out $14.3 billion in June to hire Scale AI founder Alexandr Wang, who's now leading AI strategy, along with other engineers and researchers from the startup.In October, Vishal Shah, who spent four years leading the company's metaverse efforts, was named vice president of AI products. That month Meta lifted the range of its 2025 capital expenditures to between $70 billion and $72 billion and said dollar growth would be \"notably larger\" in 2026. watch nowThe studios that are closing as part of the latest changes include Armature Studio, Twisted Pixel, and Sanzaru, as well as a technical unit called Oculus Studios Central Technology, sources told CNBC. Jobs are also being cut at other studios including Ouro Interactive, which Meta debuted in 2023 to build first-party content for Horizon Worlds.  Supernatural, a VR fitness app that Meta purchased for $400 million in 2023, was moved into maintenance mode, meaning it will be run by a skeleton crew and no longer receive new content, said people with knowledge of the matter.Meta laid the groundwork for this week's announcement in December, when the company said it would be shifting resources within Reality Labs' budget away from its VR initiatives toward its endeavors with AI glasses and wearable devices. \"This is part of that effort, and we plan to reinvest the savings to support the growth of wearables this year,\" a Meta spokesperson said, without commenting specifically on the layoffs.  While Meta's VR projects have never taken off, the company has had better success in AI-powered wearables, particularly through a partnership with EssilorLuxottica to make Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses.In September, the two companies unveiled the Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses, which cost $799 and contain a single, built-in display that shows users small messages and previews of photos. Meta said last week that it would delay the global debut of the display glasses, citing \"limited\" inventories amid \"unprecedented\" U.S. demand.Luxottica CFO Stefano Grassi said in October that his company will be able to reach the 10 million unit capacity for the glasses that it had originally planned to hit by the end of 2026 earlier than anticipated.More like RobloxDespite the downsizing, Meta isn't abandoning VR. The company is courting developers who build games for Roblox, a virtual world gaming platform popular with kids, to build experiences for Horizon Worlds, sources said. Roblox says it has more than 150 million daily users, while Horizon, which Zuckerberg showcased at the time of the company name change, has never drawn more than a couple hundred thousand active users a month. By taking cues from the likes of Roblox and Minecraft, which Microsoft acquired in 2014, Horizon Worlds could serve as a funnel for Meta to attract a younger audience to its services. Last year Bosworth directed the company to turn Horizon Worlds into a hit smartphone app, after beginning a test of a mobile version in 2023, people familiar with the matter told CNBC. Meta moved employees from other parts of Reality Labs onto the Horizon Worlds team in 2025, ex-employees said.Ben Hatton, an analyst for CCS Insight who covers connected devices, said the underperformance of VR headsets and the continuing growth of mobile forced Meta's hand. \"It kind of follows that Meta will be moving it towards mobile as mobile gaming has become very popular over the last five years or so,\" Hatton said.Ouro is one of the studios that will be working on mobile content for Horizon Worlds, people said. Andrew Bosworth, chief technology officer of Meta Platforms Inc., speaks during a Bloomberg Television interview on the sidelines of the Meta Connect event in Menlo Park, California, US, on Wednesday, Sept. 25, 2024.David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesMeta's decision to scale back its VR efforts comes 12 years after Facebook entered the market with the $2 billion purchase of Oculus VR. Since late 2020, Meta's Reality Labs division has logged over $70 billion in cumulative losses. In its latest quarterly earnings in October, Meta said Reality Labs recorded a $4.4 billion loss on $470 million in sales.Meanwhile, the company is wrestling with a scattershot AI strategy as it tries to keep pace with OpenAI and Google, whose large language models and AI features are soaring in popularity. Meta plans to release its next frontier model, codenamed Avocado, in the first quarter of this year, CNBC reported last month. Meta's stock price badly trailed Alphabet's last year and came up short of the Nasdaq, a trend that's continued in the early days of 2026, with the shares down more than 4% since the calendar changed. Horizon Worlds has been a struggle from the start. In August 2022, 10 months after Zuckerberg announced plans to go all-in on the metaverse, he posted a photo to his Facebook profile showing his avatar in front of animated versions of the Eiffel Tower and Spain's Basílica de la Sagrada Família. The picture was lambasted on social media for its low-quality graphics. Zuckerberg posted a new image days later of an improved version of his avatar, promising users that \"major updates to Horizon and avatar graphics\" were coming soon.But inside Horizon Worlds, the photo fiasco was a defining moment, according to people familiar with the matter. Zuckerberg called a meeting with the team responsible for VR avatars demanding improvements, one of the people said.Multiple VR developers told CNBC that Horizon Worlds usage remains low based on their observations, adding that the company doesn't share specific stats. The developers said they're frustrated because they don't have accurate information that could help them create more compelling games and experiences.Rather, in Meta's refocusing toward a more Roblox-like experience, the company last year began instructing existing third-party Horizon Worlds developers to build kid-friendly, simplistic games.Deepak Nair, a developer advocate at Meta, discussed the strategy in August with an audience of developers in Berlin, encouraging them to mimic Roblox and Minecraft in building games that let kids create stories they can share with their friends. Nair said a key issue for developers is identifying the right demographic. \"Generally 13 to 24, right?\" Nair said. \"And even on other ecosystems, it's even younger than that.\" In February, Meta launched a $50 million Creator Fund intended to entice developers to create more in-game experiences inside Horizon Worlds, with a focus on mobile. The company is planning to make it easy for Facebook and Instagram users to seamlessly access Horizon Worlds, sources said. -- CNBC's Kif Leswing contributed to this report.

    "body": "Iranians gather while blocking a street during a protest in Tehran, Iran on January 9, 2026. Mahsa | Afp | Getty ImagesAs Iran's future hangs in the balance as civil unrest gathers steam, its powerful ally Russia can do little but watch and wait as the U.S. ponders its next move against the Islamic Republic.U.S. President Donald Trump has not ruled out using military strikes against the conservative religious regime that has ruled Iran since 1979. On Tuesday, he repeated that threat, warning the U.S. would take \"very strong action\" if Iran executed arrested protestors. Trump has already said any country doing business with Iran would be hit with a 25% tariff. Russia will be focused on how events unfold in Iran given Tehran's position as a key strategic, military,  economic and trade partner for Moscow in the Middle East. The prospect of another ally falling in the Middle East will be a worrying one for Moscow, particularly after it has seen its alliances with Venezuela, Syria, and the Caucasus upended recently, denting its power and influence abroad.\"Moscow sees the potential loss of Iran as a much more significant risk to both its regional national posture than it saw the loss of Syria, Venezuela, or arguably its influence in Armenia over the last few years,\" Max Hess, founder of political risk consultancy Enmetena Advisory, told CNBC Tuesday.\"The reason for this is because Iran is itself a regional power projector, which offers Russia a platform to build alliances and expand its own influence,\" he said.Russian President Vladimir Putin gestures as Iranian Minister of Petroleum Javad Owji (second from left) looks on during the welcoming ceremony at the airport on July 19, 2022, in Tehran, Iran. Putin and his Turkish counterpart Erdogan arrived in Iran for the summit.Contributor | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesMario Bikarski, senior analyst of Europe and Central Asia at Verisk Maplecroft, agreed that any regime collapse would be worrying for Moscow, and could also unleash wider regional instability in the Caucasus region that separates Russia and Iran.\"There have been Iranian protests in the past, and Russia has always looked at them but never reacted, because they probably hoped that the Iranian regime will be able to withstand the pressure. But [this time] the pressure has been building up, and it's not only domestic, it's also external,\" he told CNBC Tuesday.watch now\"Should the Iranian regime fall, Russia would probably have to scramble and find new ways to ensure that instability does not reach its borders, and also that it's maintaining some influence in the region,\" he said. If a leadership vacuum emerged in Iran and rival factions vied for power, leading to further violence and unrest, that would mean \"big security trouble for Russia and for a lot of other countries in the region,\" Bikarski warned.Nuanced partnershipNeither the Kremlin nor Russian President Vladimir Putin have commented on the events unfolding in Iran, although a muted response from Russia's leadership is not uncommon when it's trying to gauge the outcome of a particular event and how its strategic interests are impacted. Russian state media has downplayed coverage of the protests in Iran, but Russian officials have blamed the unrest on \"foreign interference\" without presenting evidence to back up such claims.Russia's foreign ministry said in a statement Tuesday that the unrest could lead to \"disastrous consequences ... for the situation in the Middle East and global international security.\" Meanwhile, Sergei Shoigu, the secretary of Russia's Security Council, decried what he described as \"attempts by foreign powers to interfere in Iran's internal affairs,\" echoing Iranian accusations of Western interference.A shared anti-Western ideology has been a bonding factor for Russia and Iran, as have international sanctions, which meant that Iran was one of the few international partners that Moscow could rely on for military hardware help after it invaded Ukraine in 2022. The relationship has significantly deepened during the war, with Iran supplying Russia with \"Shahed\" attack drones and, allegedly, missiles, ammunition, and artillery for use in the war. Tehran admits it supplied drones to Russia but said it did so before the war.In return, Iran reportedly received military technology and intelligence from Russia, as well as funding for its space and missile programs. Tehran was also believed to have coveted Russian Su-35 fighter aircraft and S-400 air defense missile systems, but it's unclear whether it ever received these.Russian President Vladimir Putin (R) shakes hands with Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian (L) during their meeting, October 11, 2024, in Ashgabat, Turkmenistan.Contributor | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesOne of the clearest signs that the alliance was more nuanced than it initially appeared, however, was when Russia stood back during heightened tensions between Iran and Israel, and amid 12 days of U.S. and Israeli air strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities. Analysts told CNBC at the time that Russia was likely unable to support Tehran militarily — given its operations in Ukraine — but that it was also unwilling to do so, as any direct conflict with the U.S. and Israel would be highly dangerous and damaging to Russia. The end of an alliance?Moscow's standoffish stance last year was a wake-up call to Tehran's leadership about the limits of its alliance with Putin — limits that were being seen today too, analysts said.\"There is absolutely nothing meaningful that Russia can provide the Iranian regime to save it. It's too late, and I am not even sure the opportunity to aid the regime domestically ever existed since the Iranian people rose up,\" Bilal Saab, associate fellow in the Middle East and North Africa Programme at Chatham House, told CNBC Tuesday.\"The idea that Russia will come to Iran's aid or provide significant military expenditure to try to prop up the regime ... is very unlikely,\" Hess noted.\"Russia prioritizes its own interests ... and doesn't really believe in alliances, at least under Vladimir Putin, only ways to project power.\"That is something that the Kremlin would be planning to do in the event of regime change in Iran, Bikarski said.\"Russia would try to re-engage with whoever succeeds the Islamic Republic, and would and try to ensure that their interests are shared with whatever new government takes form,\" he noted, with the alternative being that Russia is \"completely pushed out of the Middle East.\" That scenario, he said, would be highly undesirable for Russia. \"While it doesn't have the capacity right now to project power militarily or have a very strong trade relationship, it still wants to be seen as a partner in that region and would not like to relegate all of its influence to the United States voluntarily.\"",

    "body": "Warren Buffett and Greg Abel walkthrough the Berkshire Hathaway Annual Shareholders Meeting in Omaha, Nebraska on May 3, 2025. David A. Grogen | CNBCIn the final stretch of his tenure atop Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett was still pursuing that elusive elephant.The 95-year-old legendary investor, who handed over the CEO reins to Greg Abel at the start of 2026, made it clear that deal size was not the constraint, it was lack of opportunities.\"It's external circumstances. Believe me if after we get finished talking you say, 'I've got a great $100 billion new idea.' I would say, 'Let's talk,'\" Buffett told Becky Quick in a special interview in May after he said he was stepping down at the end of the year. The never-before-seen interview is part of the \"Warren Buffett: A Life and Legacy\" special airing Tuesday at 7 p.m. ET. on CNBC. The remarks underscore a central paradox at Berkshire today. The company is awash in liquidity, with its cash hoard swelling to a record $381.6 billion at the end of the third quarter, but Buffett found no opportunities in 2025 large enough to move the needle at prices he considers sensible.\"It means that when I look at the stock market, when I look at companies of a size that would make any difference to our total, I don't see anything. Well, we're buying one or two things, but it's peanuts. But I'm willing to spend $100 billion this afternoon, you know,\" Buffett, now chairman, told CNBC.In October, Berkshire closed a deal to buy Occidental Petroleum's chemical business, OxyChem, for $9.7 billion in cash, marking its largest purchase since 2022, when it paid $11.6 billion for insurer Alleghany.Berkshire's cash has grown significantly after Buffett aggressively dumped enormous pieces of his two largest holdings, Apple and Bank of America. Buffett doesn't want to be sitting on this much cash. He has long warned that cash is a poor long-term asset, even as he insists on holding ample reserves to weather unforeseen shocks.\"I'd rather have $100 billion and a really good business at a sensible price than have $100 billion in cash,\" he said. \"At certain levels, cash is necessary, but cash is not a good asset.\"He likened liquidity to oxygen, cheap to maintain and catastrophic to run out of at the wrong moment.\"You always want to have enough,\" Buffett said. \"You don't have to pay a lot for it. But you do need oxygen. And cash is that way. You always need to have it available because you do not know what will happen. I do not know what the stock market will do, and I do not know what business will do.\"Abel has been a longtime lieutenant who played a central role in several of Berkshire's acquisitions particularly in energy, and helped transform Berkshire Hathaway Energy into a powerhouse.While Abel's deal-making credentials are established, Berkshire shareholders may not extend him the same patience they have long afforded Buffett. With the conglomerate sitting on a mountain of cash and shares underperforming the market, pressure to deploy capital could quickly become a defining challenge for the new CEO.",

    "body": "Big Tech has been on an energy hiring spree.Technology companies investing heavily in artificial intelligence are bolstering their workforce with energy experts as they look to overcome the biggest bottleneck in scaling AI: access to power.Energy-related hiring jumped 34% year-on-year in 2024, according to data compiled by Workforce.ai for CNBC. Last year's hiring almost matched this pace and remained 30% higher than pre-AI levels of 2022, when ChatGPT was released late in the year.Energy is increasingly important to Big Tech companies whose AI ambitions hinge on securing power for insatiable data centers. Data centers accounted for around 1.5% of global electricity consumption in 2024 – representing a 12% year-on-year rise over the last five years, per the International Energy Agency. Demand is widely anticipated to increase further in line with the build-out of infrastructure.Meeting that demand is one of Big Tech's biggest hurdles, leading companies to bring energy knowledge in-house and build their own supply — and, in some cases, gobbling up whole companies along the way.It marks a step-change from traditional sustainability roles, which boomed in the Inflation Reduction Act era but lost steam amid broader ESG backlash that intensified as U.S. President Donald Trump's second term got underway. Instead, operational roles have been in demand: energy procurement, markets, grid interface and strategy, according to energy recruiters who spoke with CNBC.Microsoft is a quiet winner of the talent war, with over 570 additions since 2022, including Betsy Beck who joined in January last year as director of energy markets. She previously held an energy markets and policy role at Google. Microsoft also snapped up General Electric's former CFO Carolina Dybeck Happe back in 2024 to be the firm's chief operating officer — perhaps an early indication of the mega-cap's playbook. It is second only to Amazon, which has notched 605 energy-related hires, though this data includes its subsidiary AWS.Google has played catch-up to its Silicon Valley neighbors when it comes to AI – and it appears to be paying off as shares in its parent company, Alphabet, have been on a tear. Its market capitalization surpassed Apple's for the first time since 2019 on last week. The technology giant's energy strategy — which has seen the addition of 340 hires since 2022 — has also garnered attention. Eric Schubert, an energy regulatory affairs advisor who previously worked with BP for nearly 14 years, joined Google in January, per his LinkedIn profile. Google brought Duke University researcher Tyler Norris on board in November to head up energy market innovation, and is still growing its energy market and policy team. Targeting energy and data center know-howAs well as individual talent grabs, Big Tech has snapped up energy-related companies while simultaneously scaling work with contractors. Notably, Alphabet is set to acquire data center company Intersect in a $4.75 billion cash deal that includes the assumption of debt.Project and construction managers and people with land acquisition roles are increasingly in demand but are being serviced with temporary contracts to oversee the initial build-out of infrastructure for these tech giants, rather than via permanent employees, according to Daniel Smart, group CEO of The Green Recruitment Company. \"There are tech companies that are turning into energy companies,\"Daniel Smartgroup CEO of The Green Recruitment CompanySuch companies are comfortable owning, funding, and running energy projects, \"but they've never built one before, it's not really their core business,\" Smart said. \"So they'll outsource the construction of it, and possibly even outsource the running of it and just buy the energy. So there's different models and different ways in which they do it.\" \"Phase two\" will be to try to improve the energy efficiency of data centers — perhaps leading to more permanent roles — he added, but it's not a current priority as \"there's such a scramble for just getting the energy.\" It could spell trouble for utilities and other energy companies now battling Big Tech's deep pockets for acquiring talent. watch nowJeff Anderson, business development director of a renewable energy recruitment consultancy Taylor Hopkinsons, said his team is \"talking to senior candidates from the energy infrastructure space who are becoming aware of the opportunities in data centres and the higher salaries on offer in tech, and are making enquiries and plans to move across long-term.\"\"In the short-term, the talent market is going to be tight. The skillsets the tech companies are hiring — energy strategy, PPAs, grid connection — are already in demand across renewables and utilities. The talent is there, but it's a finite pool and that means competition for specialists that have tangible project experience is going to increase,\" he added. For Travis Miller, senior equities energy and utilities analyst at Morningstar, increased energy demand actually offers \"big opportunities\" for utilities and their workforce as tech companies turn to them for support rather than seeing them as acquisition targets. \"That's the most efficient way to do it from a workforce perspective and from an infrastructure perspective,\" Miller told CNBC.Read more\"It's such a large amount of energy that they can't do it themselves,\" he added. Big Tech has secured power purchase agreements with a range of companies, including those working on nuclear energy. On Friday, Meta announced that it has signed deals with small modular reactor company Oklo — which was taken public via Sam Altman's special purpose acquisition company in 2024 — and Vistra and Terrapower. Oklo and Vistra saw their share prices pop over 17% on the news. That said, Meta also filed an application to the U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission back in November to become an electricity trader. Amazon, Google and Microsoft already have approval to do so, meaning they can sell excess power from their own supply back to the grid.\"There are tech companies that are turning into energy companies,\" Smart said, though he added that this is only for their own use right now. \"But, then, they can also then sell any additional energy that they're making to neighbors or to the grid – if they can get connectivity.\"",

Amgen revealed Monday that a trial of its experimental GLP-1 drug, MariTide, showed that patients were able to maintain weight loss for two years when given a monthly injection. Right now, most widely-used weight loss injections are taken weekly. Bradway told Cramer that the pharmaceutical giant expects the drug can be used monthly or even less frequently, saying he's encouraged about data that suggests it can be taken quarterly. Bradway also said Amgen is studying the efficacy of a range of different doses, adding that \"we want to understand what will it take for patients to stay on this therapy, because persistence is the name of the game.\"Bradway also touched on Amgen's acquisition of Horizon Therapeutics, saying the deal is working well in part because it plays to his company's strengths — biologics and autoimmunity. \"The medicines we acquired address autoimmune conditions, and they're largely biologics and are at an early stage of their life cycle,\" Bradway said. \"So we're continuing to explore ways and new diseases that might benefit from these treatments. And so far so good.\"watch now",

    "body": "Yoon Suk Yeol, South Korea's president, arrives for a hearing at the Constitutional Court of Korea in Seoul, South Korea, on Tuesday, Jan. 21, 2025. Bloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesSouth Korea's special prosecutor has requested the death penalty for former President Yoon Suk Yeol over his short-lived martial law declaration in 2024. The request came as Yoon's trial wrapped up late Tuesday. The court is expected to deliver its ruling on Feb. 19. Yoon has been charged with leading an insurrection, a crime that is not shielded by presidential immunity and carries the maximum penalty of death. If carried out, it would be South Korea's first execution in almost 30 years.Amnesty International has classified the country as \"abolitionist in practice,\" noting that while South Korea still retains the death penalty, it has not executed anyone since 1997.During the final hearing, special counsel Cho Eun-suk's team said that Yoon declared martial law \"with the purpose of remaining in power for a long time by seizing the judiciary and legislature,\" according to South Korean media reports. Yoon reportedly maintained his innocence, saying the declaration was within his constitutional authority and was intended to \"safeguard freedom and sovereignty.\"At the time, Yoon accused the then-opposition Democratic Party of Korea of engaging in \"anti-state activities\" and colluding with \"North Korean communists.\"On Dec 3, 2024, Yoon ordered troops to the country's National Assembly after declaring martial law in a late-night address. Soldiers blocked access and clashed with protesters and lawmakers as special forces attempted to enter the chamber.But within three hours, the martial law order was overturned after 190 of the 300 National Assembly lawmakers managed to gather in the chamber and unanimously voted to overturn the decree. Yoon eventually lifted martial law about six hours after announcing it.The last military coup in South Korea occurred in 1979, when the then-army general Chun Doo-hwan seized control following the assassination of President Park Chung-hee.Chun later expanded martial law nationwide in 1980, a move that led to the 1980 Gwangju uprising, during which troops violently suppressed protests in the southwestern city of Gwangju that left anywhere between 200 and 2,000 civilians killed. At the time, Chun's government accused the uprising of being instigated by \"North Korean communists and gangsters.\"In 1996, Chun was handed the death penalty for his role in the 1979 coup, though his sentence was later commuted to life imprisonment.",

The defendants also claim that post-employment agreements are \"facially overbroad and unenforceable\" and say Palantir's interpretation is meant to \"stifle competition.\"The lawsuit, originally filed by Palantir in October in the Southern District of New York, accused Percepta co-founder and CEO Hirsh Jain and co-founder Radha Jain of using stolen information to create a \"copycat\" business. Palantir also claimed the founders, who used to work for the data analytics company, attempted to poach talent and \"plunder Palantir's valuable intellectual property.\" Palantir accused a third Percepta employee, Joanna Cohen, of sending herself confidential documents after resigning and photographing sensitive information she downloaded to her personal phone. Percepta in December denied using any of Palantir's confidential information and called the case \"baseless.\"Attorneys said in Monday's filing that in-depth searches did not find any Palantir materials and argued that the screenshots taken by Cohen were done in \"good faith\" to help her complete tasks. They said the materials \"would be useless to Percepta and are by now stale regardless.\"Palantir declined to comment. WATCH: Highlights of DealBook Summit 2025watch now",

Cfoto | Future Publishing | Getty ImagesChina's exports growth in December sharply beat expectations, catapulting the annual trade surplus to a record high, while imports rose at their fastest pace in three months. Exports surged 6.6% in U.S. dollar terms last month from a year earlier, Chinese customs data showed Wednesday, topping analysts' median estimate for a 3% growth and accelerating from a 5.9% jump in November.Imports rose 5.7% in December from a year earlier, topping expectations for a 0.9% growth — strongest since September last year when they climbed 7.4%, according to LSEG data.   China's exports for the full year grew 5.5% while imports stayed flat, taking Beijing's trade surplus to $1.19 trillion, up 20% from 2024.  Shipments to the U.S. plunged 30% in December from a year ago — declining for a ninth straight month — while imports from the country dropped 29%, customs data showed.  Signaling a sharp drop in trade with the U.S. in 2025 amid tariff tensions, China's exports to the country dropped 20% while imports declined 14.6%. Lv Daliang, spokesperson for China's customs authority, told reporters Wednesday that the trade relations with the U.S. should be \"mutually-beneficial,\" calling for \"dialogue and negotiation\" to resolve issues and expand cooperation.     As Chinese exporters have ramped up shipments to non-U.S. markets, the growing trade imbalance has prompted concerns from major trading partners, including the European Union. International Monetary Fund Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva in a December press conference urged Beijing to shift away from relying on exports for growth and accelerate its push to boost domestic consumption.     Surplus worries China's trade surplus is going to have “as destructive an impact on the global trading system as Trump's tariffs,” said Eswar Prasad, a senior fellow at Brookings Institution, as the country's sluggish domestic demand drags down global growth.  Nations around the world are likely to seek protection for their own economies by erecting trade barriers, Prasad cautioned. Chinese officials in December pledged to expand imports and work toward balancing trade. China's exports to the European Union and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations rose 12% and 11%, respectively, in December, while imports from the European nations expanded 18% and fell 5% from Southeast Asian countries.The nearly $19 trillion economy has struggled to shake off deflationary pressure as a deepening real estate collapse has weighed on household demand and a weak job market has clouded consumer confidence. Consumer prices in the country stayed flat in 2025, missing the official target of around 2% increase.   The World Bank in its report released Tuesday raised its forecast for China's growth in 2026 to 4.4%, 0.4 percentage point higher than its June projection, anticipating further fiscal stimulus, continued resilience of exports and improved investment sentiment. Zhiwei Zhang, president and chief economist at Pinpoint Asset Management, said Beijing will likely keep its macro policy stance unchanged at least in the first quarter, as strong exports growth has helped mitigate soft domestic demand and trade tensions with the U.S. have eased.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tWeekly analysis and insights from Asia's largest economy in your inbox\n\t\t\tSubscribe now\n\t\t\n\tChina and U.S. in October agreed to roll back a series of export-control measures and higher tariffs in a 1-year trade truce, following a meeting between Chinese President Xi Jinping and his American counterpart Donald Trump. Beijing also pledged to buy at least 12 million tons of U.S. soybeans over the next two months. According to the official data, the country bought 111.8 million tons of soybeans last year, up 6.5% from the 2024 level. In December, its imports of the crop were up only 1.3% at 8 million tons.  China's exports of rare earths jumped 32% in December to 4,392 tons and throughout the year, its shipments of the critical mineral were 12.9% more than the previous year. China is set to release next Monday its annual and fourth-quarter gross domestic product data.

    "body": "Bill Gates is as optimistic about the world's future as ever, despite the fact that we're living through \"an era with so many challenges and so much polarization,\" the billionaire philanthropist and Microsoft co-founder wrote in a blog post on Friday.The world faces plenty of causes for concern over issues like climate change, global health and poverty, and disruptions caused by artificial intelligence, Gates wrote. However, \"we are far better off than when I was born 70 years ago,\" wrote Gates, due particularly to innovations in technology and global health.Gates also believes that conditions will keep improving over the next two decades, especially as AI spurs new advances, he wrote: \"I am still an optimist because I see what innovation accelerated by artificial intelligence will bring.\"But there are a few caveats. \"These days, my optimism comes with footnotes,\" wrote Gates.Specifically, Gates is concerned about three questions that could determine \"the trajectory of [the world's] progress,\" he wrote:1. Will a world that is getting richer increase its generosity toward those in need?The number of worldwide deaths of children under 5 years old was projected to increase by roughly 200,000 in 2025, rising for the first time in 25 years, according to a report released by the Gates Foundation in December.The projected stat is \"the thing I am most upset about\" regarding the world's progress, Gates wrote on Friday. He linked it to significant cuts to global aid spending by leading world governments, including the U.S.\"Over the last 25 years, those deaths went down faster than at any other point in history. But in 2025, they went up for the first time this century...\" wrote Gates. \"This trend will continue unless we make progress in restoring aid budgets.\"The global standard of living's continued improvement depends, in part, on wealthy countries and individuals — like himself — re-committing to contribute some of their abundant resources to help those in need and reduce inequality around the world, Gates wrote. The billionaire announced plans in May 2025 to step up his own charitable giving as part of a pledge to give away \"virtually all\" of his wealth — which is currently estimated at $118 billion by Bloomberg — by 2045.\"This idea of treating others as you wish to be treated does not just apply to rich countries giving aid. It must also include philanthropy from the wealthy to help those in need — both domestically and globally — which should grow rapidly in a world with a record number of billionaires and even centibillionaires,\" he wrote on Friday.2. Will the world prioritize scaling innovations that improve equality?Gates' optimism is bolstered by his belief in the power of technology, particularly AI, to create new breakthroughs in medical treatments, he wrote. Gates pointed to AI-powered advances in Alzheimer's research, as well as cancer and health crises still faced by developing countries, from malaria to malnutrition.The Microsoft co-founder has also long been a proponent of using AI to improve education in the U.S. and abroad. AI tutors could eventually \"be like a great high school teacher,\" providing personalized instruction to students across all income levels and geographies, Gates said on his \"Unconfuse Me\" podcast in August 2023.DON'T MISS: How to build custom GPTs and use AI agentsIn his blog post, Gates also linked environmental issues to global equality, writing that climate change could \"join poverty and infectious disease in causing enormous suffering, especially for the world's poorest people.\"After previously arguing for some climate research funding to be redirected to issues like poverty and health care, Gates wrote on Friday that he still plans on \"investing and giving more than ever to climate work in the years ahead.\"AI's agricultural applications could help provide farmers in developing countries with better advice, and more adaptive crops, to help them survive the challenges of growing food in warming environments, he wrote.3. Will we minimize negative disruptions caused by AI as it accelerates?Clearly, Gates is an AI optimist. He also wrote about the technology's risks, and the need to work proactively to avoid worst-case scenarios, citing two specific challenges for the next two decades: the potential use of AI by bad actors and disruptions to the job market.\"Both are real risks that we need to do a better job managing,\" wrote Gates. World governments and the tech industry will have to be \"deliberate about how this technology is developed, governed, and deployed,\" he added.Gates didn't offer any specific suggestions, but did push back against the idea that AI might significantly damage the prospects of human workers, writing that \"we should be able to allocate these new capabilities in ways that benefit everyone,\" including the potential for shorter work weeks for some people. Such optimism stems from his belief in \"two core human capabilities,\" he noted.\"The first is our ability to anticipate problems and prepare for them, and therefore ensure that our new discoveries make all of us better off. The second is our capacity to care about each other,\" Gates wrote, adding that history is filled with examples of people who put \"the greater good\" ahead of their own personal interests.\"Those two qualities — foresight and care — are what give me hope as the year begins,\" Gates wrote. \"As long as we keep exercising those abilities, I believe the years ahead can be ones of real progress.\"Want to get ahead at work with AI?

    "body": "U.S. President Donald Trump takes questions from reporters, as he attends a meeting with oil industry executives, at the White House in Washington, D.C., U.S., Jan. 9, 2026. Kevin Lamarque | ReutersPresident Donald Trump said Friday his administration will take action on Greenland \"whether they like it or not,\" further escalating his rhetoric as he pushes to acquire the Danish territory for the U.S.\"I would like to make a deal, you know, the easy way. But if we don't do it the easy way, we're going to do it the hard way,\" Trump told reporters at the White House.The comments came during a meeting with oil executives to discuss the prospect of doing business in Venezuela. Less than a week earlier, the U.S. military invaded the oil-rich South American nation and captured its leader, Nicolás Maduro.Trump has long sought to take over Greenland, primarily citing the Arctic island's importance for U.S. national security. Denmark and its European allies in NATO – the military alliance co-founded by the U.S. – have pushed back, reiterating that Greenland is not for sale. But the Trump administration nevertheless says it is currently weighing a range of options on Greenland, including utilizing the U.S. military or cutting a deal to purchase it from Denmark.Government officials have also mulled sending lump sums of cash to Greenlanders in order to sway them to join the U.S., Reuters reported Thursday.Asked on Friday how much those payments could be, Trump said, \"I'm not talking about money for Greenland, yet.\"\"I might talk about that, but right now we are going to do something on Greenland, whether they like it or not,\" Trump said.\"Because if we don't do it, Russia or China will take over Greenland, and we're not going to have Russia or China as a neighbor,\" he said.Trump said that while he is a \"big fan\" of Denmark, \"the fact that they had a boat land there 500 years ago doesn't mean that they own the land. [I'm] sure we had lots of boats go there also.\"\"So we're going to be doing something with Greenland, either the nice way or the more difficult,\" he said.The U.S. military already maintains a base in Greenland, and it reportedly has the ability to expand its presence there if desired.But that isn't enough, Trump said.\"When we own it, we defend it. You don't defend leases the same way, you have to own it,\" he said.",

    "body": "FILE PHOTO: U.S. President Donald Trump looks on as he signs executive orders and proclamations in the Oval Office at the White House, in Washington, D.C., U.S., May 5, 2025. Leah Millis | ReutersPresident Donald Trump's attack on Venezuela and threats to other countries, as well as concerns about affordability, exposed fractures within the congressional GOP this week at the start of a challenging midterm election year.Trump avoided defeat when most House Republicans declined to override the first of two vetoes of his presidency, which spiked a pair of nonpartisan infrastructure bills that would've benefited Colorado and Florida.But it was otherwise a less-than-stellar week for Trump on Capitol Hill, though Republicans are projecting confidence.\"This isn't an unusual situation, particularly coming into midterm elections, where you have senators that are in tough situations,\" Sen. Bill Hagerty, R-Tenn., said Friday on CNBC's \"Squawk Box.\"A senior White House official said the defectors represent just a \"tiny fraction\" of congressional Republicans.\"Republicans aren't always going to have the same views as the president,\" the White House official said.Read more CNBC politics coverageNew cellphone video of Minneapolis ICE shooting incident revealedIran's leader accuses protesters of acting for TrumpTrump suggests U.S. military will hit cartels on 'land' in MexicoPortland: Border Patrol agent shoots 2 after ICE killing in MinneapolisTrump 'instructing' his 'Representatives' to buy $200B in mortgage bondsEpstein files: Reps ask judge to appoint special master for document releaseStill, cracks in GOP unity emerged on multiple fronts.On Thursday, 17 House Republicans broke ranks and voted with Democrats on legislation to extend enhanced Affordable Care Act tax credits for three years, despite opposition from House Speaker Mike Johnson of Louisiana and the widespread unpopularity of the Obamacare subsidies within the Republican party. The White House official said Trump opposes a three-year extension, but the vote was not viewed internally as a defeat.The enhanced tax credits were first enacted under President Joe Biden in 2021 and have been a focal point of Democratic messaging on health care and affordability. The credits expired at the end of 2025, resulting in sharply higher premiums for millions of Americans who get their health insurance on ACA marketplaces.Many of those who supported the bill to extend the tax credits were among the most vulnerable Republicans in the 2026 midterms.\"I have long opposed the damage the Unaffordable Care Act has done to our country, but I will not watch Wisconsinites lose health care because Democrats let their own law collapse,\" Rep. Derrick Van Orden, R-Wis., who voted for their extension, posted on X. Van Orden is running for reelection in a toss up district, according to Cook Political Report.Earlier on Thursday, five Senate Republicans bucked the president and joined Democrats on a procedural vote that could rein in his ability to take military action in Venezuela. Trump responded in a Truth Social post that \"Republicans should be ashamed\" of the senators who supported the preliminary vote and said they \"should never be elected to office again.\"Sen. Todd Young, R-Ind., one of the members called out by Trump, declined to comment on the president's comments on Thursday. When asked if he was open to changing his stance on subsequent War Powers votes, Young told reporters, \"Why would I?\"The White House, however, said there is a \"significant\" chance future votes on the resolution might go the president's way.\"A number of these members have left the door open to additional conversations,\" the senior official said.Meanwhile, Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., who is retiring at the end of his term in January 2027, has found himself at odds with the administration on several fronts. On Wednesday, Tillis took aim at White House senior adviser Stephen Miller from the Senate floor, calling Miller's comments about the U.S. taking over Greenland \"amateurish\" and \"stupid.\" The White House official called those remarks \"disappointing.\"A day after U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents killed a civilian in Minnesota, Tillis also announced he was blocking all Department of Homeland Security nominees. Tillis, however, said the hold was not related to the shooting, and instead had to do with Trump's Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem so far refusing to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee.\"All I'm saying is, you need to show respect to a committee of jurisdiction,\" Tillis told reporters this week.And on Thursday, Tillis and Sen. Jeff Merkley, D-Ore., secured passage of a resolution to place a plaque honoring police officers who defended the Capitol on Jan. 6 in the Senate. Language authorizing the plaque was passed into law as part of a larger appropriations bill in 2022. The monument was supposed to be displayed on the West front of the Capitol by March 2023, but had been blocked by House Republicans.Trump and his Republican allies in Congress have sought to shift the narrative on Jan. 6. On the five-year anniversary this week, the White House launched a web page casting blame on Democrats, then-Vice President Mike Pence, and Capitol Police for the violence that transpired that day.Officers \"risked their lives to defend the United States Capitol and protect members of Congress. Their brave actions upheld the rule of law and ensured that our democratic institutions could continue to function as intended,\" Tillis said in a statement. When asked about the plaque, the White House official said, \"The administration doesn't have a position on the decorations of the Capitol.\"",

    "body": "The Camp Jeep outdoor terrain at the New York International Auto Shown on April 16, 2025. Danielle DeVries | CNBCDETROIT — Stellantis is scrapping its plug-in hybrid electric Jeep SUVs and Chrysler minivan amid slowing EV sales, quality issues and weakened federal fuel economy requirements. The automaker on Friday said the decision to end production of the plug-in hybrid Jeep Wrangler, Jeep Grand Cherokee and Chrysler Pacifica was a result of waning customer demand and the need to focus on \"more competitive electrified solutions, including hybrid and range‑extended vehicles.\"\"Stellantis continually evaluates its product strategy to meet evolving customer needs and regulatory requirements. With customer demand shifting, Stellantis will phase out plug‑in hybrid (PHEV) programs in North America beginning with the 2026 model year,\" the company said in an emailed statement.The decision is an about-face for the automaker, which has touted its U.S. sales leadership of the models for years. In 2024, then-Jeep CEO Antonio Filosa — who is now CEO of Stellantis — said the SUV brand planned to sell 160,000 to 170,000 PHEVs that year, and the company said it represented 41% of U.S. PHEV sales.watch nowAside from sales, Stellantis has been using PHEVs as a way to offset its production of gas-guzzling trucks and SUVs to attempt to meet federal fuel economy standards and avoid penalties. The goal has become less urgent as the Trump administration eliminates or weakens aspects of those rules. Chrysler first introduced its PHEV minivan in 2016. Jeep debuted the Wrangler PHEV, which it called a \"4xe,\" in 2020, followed by a Grand Cherokee version in 2021.PHEVs feature traditional internal combustion engines, but also have an all-electric range when charged like an EV. They have largely been viewed as a transitional technology from traditional vehicles to EVs; however, they are quite costly because of their two different propulsion systems. The cancellation also comes amid a recall of the Jeep SUVs due to fire risk — the latest in a string of issues for the vehicles. The company is also reevaluating its product portfolio as part of its U.S. turnaround strategy.A 2022 Jeep Grand Cherokee.JeepThe company said the recall, which included a stop-sale of the vehicles, \"is in no way related\" to the cancellation of the vehicles. Jeep CEO Bob Broderdorf late last month told CNBC the brand was evaluating its electrification strategy since the end of up to $7,500 in federal incentives for EVs and PHEVs in September.He said Jeep still had vehicles on the ground that it would continue to sell, but \"all of us are waiting to see what the demand is, how it's going to continue to shake out, and what becomes steady state for 4xe and [battery] EVs in general.\"A Jeep spokeswoman said the brand will continue to offer all-electric SUVs such as the Wagoneer S and Recon, which was officially revealed late last year.",

    "body": "Jeff Greenberg | Universal Images Group | Getty ImagesCompany: Lululemon Athletica Inc. (LULU)Business: Lululemon Athletica is a technical athletic apparel, footwear, and accessories company. The company organizes its operations into four regional markets: the Americas, China Mainland, Asia Pacific (APAC), and Europe and the Middle East (EMEA). It conducts its business through different channels in each market, including the company-operated stores, e-commerce, temporary locations, wholesale, outlets, a re-commerce program, as well as license and supply arrangements. The company offers a comprehensive line of technical athletic apparel, footwear and accessories marketed under the lululemon brand. Its apparel assortment includes items such as shorts, tops and jackets designed for a healthy lifestyle, including athletic activities such as yoga, running, training and most other activities. It also offers apparel designed for being on the move and fitness-inspired accessories. It operates stores in the United States, Canada, China Mainland, Australia, South Korea and others.Stock Market Value: $23.92B ($203.90 per share) Stock Chart IconStock chart iconLululemon Athletica shares in the past 12 monthsActivist: Elliott Investment ManagementOwnership: n/aAverage Cost: n/aActivist Commentary: Elliott is a multi-strategy investment firm that manages approximately $76.1 billion in assets (as of June 30) and is one of the oldest firms of its type under continuous management. Known for its extensive due diligence and resources, Elliott regularly follows companies for years before making an investment. Elliott is the most active of activist investors, engaging with companies across industries and multiple geographies.What's happeningOn Dec. 18, it was reported that Elliott has taken a more than $1 billion position in Lululemon and is bringing in Jane Nielsen, former CFO and COO of Ralph Lauren, as a potential CEO candidate at the company.Behind the scenesLululemon is a global athletic apparel, footwear, and accessories company, offering pants, shorts, tops, and jackets for activities such as yoga, running and training. While the company remains anchored in its core North America market (~70% of revenue), it has built a significant presence in APAC (~25%), and China specifically (18%), as well as Europe (~5%). In fact, these ancillary markets have grown quite rapidly, with APAC and Europe delivering average compound annual growth rates of 33% and 22% respectively, over the past year. This international expansion has helped drive strong overall topline growth, with sales growing from $8 billion in 2023 to $11.9 billion today. However, in that same period, the company's share price has gone down from over $500 to now below $220 per share. The problem here lies in North America. Growth in this core market has slowed to low single digits, and now has turned negative, with comparable sales down 5% in the most recent quarter. Further, while the China growth story resonated with investors when North America was showing continued expansion, this narrative on its own in the face of North American core uncertainty is not something that is very appetizing to public market investors. The root challenges in the North America business can be traced back to 2018, when Calvin McDonald became Lululemon CEO. From the beginning of his tenure, and through the post-Covid period, the company operated in a golden era for athleisure, benefiting from the broad casualization of apparel and enjoying years of outsized growth as the only real large-scale player. While this environment delivered years of share price appreciation, it also masked a series of strategic missteps that would later come back to bite them. First, Lululemon used much of these earnings to pursue new business lines, including its $500 million acquisition of Mirror, as well as the launches of footwear and skincare lines, none of which have generated meaningful shareholder value. Moreover, while these initiatives may have been tolerable on their own during a period of rapid growth, they ultimately distracted management from the core North America business that was key to revenue growth. This loss of focus became especially pronounced in May 2024, when the company's chief product officer resigned. Since then, product direction and design have widely been perceived to be largely centralized under McDonald. Lululemon has shifted from its historically sleek and highly functional aesthetic toward louder branding and collaborations, such as with Disney, that are not aligned with the core customer. As a result, the company's brand perception has shifted, allowing competitors like Alo and Vuori to gain momentum and begin taking share, particular among Lululemon's core customer base of young women. This is a dynamic that is evident to anybody who shops in the category. While store traffic and brand awareness remain high, conversion has deteriorated. These product missteps have been further compounded by broader operational issues in the areas of marketing, supply chain and corporate cost controls. Together, these issues have driven margin pressure, eroded brand momentum in North America, and ultimately contributed to the sharp decline in the company's stock price. On Dec. 11, 2025, Lululemon announced that McDonald would step down as CEO effective Jan. 31, 2026. This impending leadership transition is what set the stage for Elliott to disclose a more than $1 billion position in Lululemon and bring in Jane Nielsen, former CFO and COO of Ralph Lauren, as a potential CEO candidate at the company. Lululemon is still a quality product and brand that has somewhat lost its way and needs to be invigorated. It does not need a CEO who knows all the answers (if that exists) but one who will hire the best talent and institute the right processes so management can work as a team of marketers, merchandisers and product developers to come up with the solutions. At the same time by delegating these duties to competent senior executives, Nielsen will be able to also oversee the company's supply chain and corporate structure to solve the problems there and institute a cost discipline that has been absent. This is what Nielsen has experience doing at both Ralph Lauren and Coach. In 2014, when Nielsen was at Coach, the manufacturer of luxury handbags was losing out to rivals and announced that it expected same-store sales in North America to be down by a high-teens percentage in the coming year. Nielsen told investors that Coach would be back to profitability within two years. Nielsen helped Coach close underperforming stores and get inventory under control and by March 2016, the Coach brand posted its first quarterly sales increase in North America in nearly three years. When Nielsen joined Ralph Lauren in September 2016, sales had stalled and net income had fallen approximately 50% since 2014. In a 2024 article in The Wall Street Journal, Nielsen was quoted as saying, \"The brand was bigger and better than the business was showing\" — which is similar to Lululemon today. Nielsen and the leadership team targeted millennial and Gen Z shoppers and overhauled the website and closed stores, leading to an increase of 20% in adjusted operating income.When an activist comes to a company with an idea or recommendation, they are just as happy if the company takes that recommendation or comes up with a better one. Elliott is not saying that Jane Nielsen is the best person for the job. The firm is saying that she is the best person it knows of for the job, and the firm does extensive and comprehensive diligence and analysis before making a recommendation like this. Elliott cannot name the next CEO. The board does that. And while Elliott would like to see Nielsen as the next CEO, if the board decides on someone else who is equally qualified, Elliott will support that decision. In practicality, whoever the next CEO is will be pseudo-approved by Elliott because we have never seen a qualified CEO with options take a job like this if they knew an activist like Elliott opposed his or her appointment. But Elliott's presence alone adds a lot of value to the situation which the board should recognize. First, it justifies a sense of urgency, which is needed here. Second, the firm brings to the table a more than qualified CEO candidate who is ready and willing to take on this role. Third, an activist of Elliott's stature and reputation can give the board cover in whatever decision they make. This third point is particularly important when there is an outspoken founder in the wings like Chip Wilson who has been publicly criticizing board decisions. Without the activist, even a competent and experienced board could compromise on the CEO selection to appease the vocal founder. This is very similar to Elliott's recent campaign at Starbucks, another iconic brand facing popularity, competition and image challenges with an outspoken founder not afraid to give his opinion. At Starbucks, Elliott's efforts quickly culminated in the appointment of Brian Niccol as CEO, now working to reset the company's strategy and restore investor confidence. Elliott's presence justified the urgency required and its endorsement of Niccol gave the board the external credibility to act quickly.Since Elliott engaged Lululemon, on Dec. 29, Chip Wilson has nominated three directors – Marc Maurer, the former co-CEO of On Holding AG; Laura Gentile, former chief marketing officer of ESPN; and Eric Hirshberg, former CEO of Activision, the largest segment of Activision Blizzard – for election to the board at the 2026 annual meeting.Ken Squire is the founder and president of 13D Monitor, an institutional research service on shareholder activism, and the founder and portfolio manager of the 13D Activist Fund, a mutual fund that invests in a portfolio of activist investments.",

    "body": "watch nowLeading U.S. oil executives told President Donald Trump at the White House on Friday that Venezuela will need major reforms to attract investment. Trump said Friday the industry would invest at least $100 billion to rebuild Venezuela's energy sector with U.S. security guarantees. But the CEOs of big oil companies like ExxonMobil and ConocoPhillips did not commit at the meeting to quickly re-enter Venezuela. Exxon CEO Darren Woods told Trump that the Venezuelan market is \"uninvestable\" in its current state. Venezuela seized Exxon's and Conoco's assets in 2007, and Caracas owes the companies billions of dollars in outstanding claims from arbitration cases.\"We've had our assets seized there twice, and so you can imagine to re-enter a third time would require some pretty significant changes from what we've historically seen here,\" Woods told Trump at the White House. \"If we look at the legal and commercial constructs and frameworks in place today in Venezuela today, it's uninvestable.\" Exxon is prepared to send a technical team to evaluate the current state of Venezuela's oil industry and assets, Woods said. ConocoPhillips CEO Ryan Lance congratulated Trump on ousting former President Nicolás Maduro. He said the banking sector will need to help restructure Venezuela's debt and provide billions of dollars in financing for the restore the country's infrastructure. Lance also called for the restructuring of state-owned oil company Petróleos de Venezuela (PDVSA).\"As we think that big and bold, we need to be also thinking about even restructuring the entire Venezuelan energy system including PDVSA,\" Lance told the president. Trump told the Conoco CEO that the U.S. government is not looking at recovering the assets the company lost during the 2007 nationalization. \"We're not going to look at what people lost in the past, because that was their fault,\" Trump said. \"That was a different president. You're going to make a lot of money, but we're not going to go back.\"Chevron is the only U.S. oil major operating in Venezuela through joint ventures with PDVSA. Vice Chairman Mark Nelson said Chevron has a way forward to rapidly ramp up its production, which currently stands at about 240,000 barrels per day. \"We have a path forward here very shortly to be able to increase our liftings from those joint ventures 100% essentially effective immediately,\" Nelson told Trump. \"We are also able to increase our production within our own disciplined investment schemes by about 50% just in the next 18 to 24 months.\"Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent indicated Thursday that the U.S. might rely more on smaller oil companies, rather than the majors, to invest in Venezuela. \"The big oil companies who move slowly, who have corporate boards, are not interested,\" Bessent said Thursday at the Economic Club of Minnesota. \"I can tell you that the independent oil companies and individuals, wildcatters – our phones are ringing off the hook,\" Bessent said. \"They want to get to Venezuela yesterday.\"",

    "body": "In a photo illustration, prescription drugs are seen next to a pill bottle on July 23, 2024 in New York.Spencer Platt | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesA coalition of patient advocacy groups is urging a federal court to halt the practices of third-party companies that buy drugs from countries outside the FDA-regulated U.S. supply chain, which the groups argue put U.S. patients' health at risk.The court filing comes in the wake of a CNBC investigation that documented how these third-parties — commonly referred to as alternative funding programs, or AFPs — have spread across employer-sponsored health plans nationwide. Under the growing business model, AFPs source high-cost specialty drugs from abroad at lower prices and charge employers a fee or a percentage of the savings. The AFPs then provide the medication to patients at little or no cost. AFPs are especially appealing to small employers like local school districts, county governments and others who pay their staff's health-care costs out of pocket. But there's a trade off: Federal officials at the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and the Food and Drug Administration told CNBC that these medications are illegally imported and put patients' lives at risk. A Homeland Security Investigations official last year told CNBC that criminal investigations into AFPs were ongoing.The filing in a U.S. Court of Appeals in Maryland, dated Dec. 26, was led by the HIV+Hepatitis Policy Institute, a nonprofit that advocates for safe and affordable treatment for people living with HIV and viral hepatitis. \"Forcing a person who has employer-sponsored health insurance to sign up with an unknown third-party vendor to receive their life-saving drug supplied by a foreign country not only is illegal but jeopardizes the health and safety of patients,\" wrote Carl Schmid, executive director of the HIV+Hepatitis Policy Institute, in a press release. \"While federal regulators should be shutting them down, in the meantime, the courts must step in to protect patients.\" watch nowIn the court filing, the patient groups said the arrangements can delay treatment, confuse patients and expose them to drugs that differ from those distributed through the tightly regulated U.S. system. They warned that patients with chronic and life-threatening illnesses should not be forced to trade the safety and certainty of approved U.S. supply chains for lower costs to employers.The amicus brief filing was submitted in a case brought by Gilead Sciences after the company learned that an HIV patient received Gilead medication with labeling written in Turkish. Gilead alleges the drug traveled through an unsecured supply chain that does not comply with U.S. law. Turkey is a known hotbed for counterfeit drugs, according to U.S. officials.Gilead sued several companies involved in administering employer health plans, including the alternative funding program Rx Valet.Greg Santulli, the CEO of the Georgia-based AFP, told CNBC last year that he's confident in the safety of the medications his company sources, adding that Turkey is a \"modern, sophisticated country\" capable of tracking medications through its supply chain.The lawsuit also named Meritain Health, which managed the patient's employee health plan and is owned by CVS Health.A spokesperson for CVS Health told CNBC last year that it \"has long maintained a policy that it does not support programs for non-FDA-approved medications sourced from outside the United States and does not contract with companies to facilitate the importation of non-FDA-approved medications\" from overseas.A federal judge issued a preliminary injunction blocking all parties in the case from importing Gilead medications from overseas. The defendants are appealing the ruling, with Meritain arguing the injunction is not necessary and would adversely affect its business. Rx Valet in a court filing said the injunction undermines access to safe medications, adding that Gilead's HIV drug shipped from Turkey was the same as what is sold in the U.S. at a much higher cost.",

    "body": "An Amazon warehouse in Warrington, England.Nathan Stirk | Getty ImagesAmazon has submitted plans for a large-format store near Chicago that would be larger than a Walmart Supercenter, marking the latest experiment with physical retail for the tech company.As part of the plans, Amazon has proposed building a one-story, 229,000-square-foot building in Orland Park, Illinois, that would offer a range of products, such as groceries, household essentials and general merchandise, the city said on Saturday. By comparison, Walmart's U.S. Supercenters typically average 179,000 square feet.The Amazon facility would also include a \"limited warehouse component\" to support on-site operations and space for delivery drivers to pick up orders, according to planning documents.\"We regularly test new experiences designed to make customers' lives better and easier every day, including physical stores,\" an Amazon spokesperson said in a statement. \"The site in question is our planned location for a new concept that we think customers will be excited about.\"The e-commerce company has been determined to have a bigger presence in brick-and-mortar retail after stealing market share from incumbents. Amazon acquired upscale grocer Whole Foods Market for $13.7 billion in 2017, the largest deal in its history.Amazon also launched bookstores, shopping mall kiosks, apparel stores, convenience marts and its own supermarket chain. It's since scrapped many of those concepts or slowed the rollout of new locations. The Orland Park Plan Commission approved Amazon's proposal on Tuesday, and it will now proceed to a vote from the full village board. That meeting is scheduled for Jan. 19. The proposed facility would replace a local restaurant, Petey's II, which closed in January 2024. The site sits at the corner of two major highways running through Orland Park, and would be down the street from a Target, Costco and Trader Joe's, among other major national chains. Some residents have pushed back on Amazon's planned development, expressing concerns over how it could impact traffic in the surrounding area, NBC 5 Chicago reported.WATCH: How AI could upend shoppingwatch now",

As part of the agreement, SB Energy will build and operate OpenAI's 1.2 gigawatt data center site in Milam County, Texas that was announced in September. \"Partnering with SB Energy brings together their strength in data center infrastructure and energy development and OpenAI's deep domain expertise in data center engineering,\" Greg Brockman, OpenAI's president, said in a statement on Friday. \"The result is a fast, reliable way to scale compute through large, highly optimized AI data centers.\"SB Energy is backed by SoftBank and Ares Management. The company develops, owns and operates  energy projects across the U.S. It has offices in Redwood City, California, San Diego and Denver, according to its website. In addition to the investment, SB Energy has also formed a non-exclusive preferred partnership with OpenAI and SoftBank to develop \"a new model for data center builds,\" according to the release. That model will combine OpenAI's first-party data center design with SB Energy's \"proven expertise in speed, cost discipline, and integrated energy delivery,\" the companies said.The company has several multi-gigawatt data center campuses in development, and initial facilities are under construction and expected to enter service this year, the release said. SoftBank, led by Masayoshi Son, and OpenAI have become increasingly intertwined over the past year. Two months after the Stargate project was announced, OpenAI said it closed a $40 billion financing round led by SoftBank, the largest private tech funding on record. The round included participation from core investor Microsoft, as well as Coatue, Altimeter and Thrive.SoftBank said in November that it's sold its entire stake in chipmaker Nvidia for $5.83 billion as it looks to capitalize on its \"all in\" bet on OpenAI.The ChatGPT maker is burning through mounds of cash, and is still far from profitability, meaning it remains heavily reliant on outside capital.OpenAI has inked more than $1.4 trillion of infrastructure deals in recent months to try and build out the data centers it says are needed to meet growing demand. In November, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said the company was on track to generate more than $20 billion in annualized revenue run rate in 2025, with plans to grow to hundreds of billions in sales by 2030.WATCH: Judge rules Elon Musk’s lawsuit over OpenAI for-profit conversion can head to trialwatch now",

    "body": "A cargo ship sits in New York Harbor on Nov. 19, 2025 in New York City. Spencer Plat | Getty ImagesThe Supreme Court did not rule Friday on the legality of broad tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump, leaving markets still awaiting a decision poised to have far-reaching impacts on trade policy and the U.S. fiscal situation.There had been speculation that the tariff ruling would be issued on Friday, but the Supreme Court released just one opinion for the day, and it was unrelated to tariffs.It is unclear when the tariff ruling will be released. The court will release its next rulings Wednesday.When it does come, the decision will address two issues: whether the administration can use provisions under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to levy the tariffs, and if it isn't proper, if the U.S. will have to reimburse those importers who already have paid the duties.However, the final decision could also fall somewhere in between.The court has the option to grant limited powers under the IEEPA and require only limited repayment, along with multiple other options for how it handles a touchy matter that is being closely watched on Wall Street.Moreover, even should the White House lose the case, it has other tools in its chest to implement tariffs that don't require the emergency powers cited under the act.Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent himself said Thursday he expects a \"mishmash\" ruling.\"What is not in doubt is our ability to continue collecting tariffs at roughly the same level, in terms of overall revenues,\" Bessent said during an appearance in Minneapolis. \"What is in doubt, and it's a real shame for the American people, was the president loses flexibility to use tariffs both for national security, for negotiating leverage.\"Trump used the IEEPA in part as an emergency measure to stop the inflow of fentanyl to the U.S. The impact of losingLosing the tariffs would have multiple ramifications, said Jose Torres, senior economist at Interactive Brokers.\"If the court blocks the tariffs, the administration is going to find workarounds,\" Torres said. \"President Trump is very ambitious in getting this agenda through despite potential controversies that could surround such a decision.\"\"Blocking tariffs would be bad for onshoring ambitions. It would be bad for fiscal conditions, rates would go higher,\" he added. \"But it would be good for corporate earnings. Input prices would be lower and trade would be smoother.\"Administration officials have cited a number of options to offset the court's decision should it not go their way. Prediction markets site Kalshi is pointing to just a 28% probability that the court will rule in favor of the tariffs as implemented. Torres said his firm's clients have a similar expectation. Bessent has said that the administration has at least three other options through the 1962 Trade Act that will keep most of the tariffs in place. However, he also has worried that reimbursements could place a strain on the administration and its effort to drive down the fiscal deficit. Tariffs brought in some $195 billion in fiscal 2025 and another $62 billion in 2026, according to Treasury data.Ultimately, Morgan Stanley analysts \"see significant room for nuance\" in the Supreme Court decision. The court \"has wide latitude when it comes to issuing decisions, a range of outcomes is possible, like the Court narrowing the scope of existing tariffs but not mandating their full removal or limiting the future application of tariffs,\" Morgan Stanley analysts Ariana Salvatore and Bradley Tian said in a note.\"We do think there's scope for the administration to take a lighter-touch approach to the overall tariff regime given a recent political focus on affordability,\" they added.The tariff impact thus far has defied analyst projections: There's been a limited impact on inflation, while the trade deficit has plunged, countering expectations in some quarters that the tariffs could make the U.S. a pariah on the global trading stage. The trade imbalance for October hit its lowest level since the end of the financial crisis in 2009, at a time when imports had declined sharply due to the massive recession the crisis generated.",

Joblessness in Generation Z is on the rise as nearly one million young British people, between the ages of 16 and 24, were NEETs (not in education, employment, or training), between July and September 2025, according to the U.K. Office for National Statistics. Identified as a crisis, the government launched an independent review into NEETs in December, led by former Labour Health Secretary Alan Milburn. Worryingly, the ONS report found that almost 600,000 of those young people who were unemployed were also not actively looking for a job. Young people are facing several challenges in the job market, from artificial intelligence eliminating entry-level positions to increased competition for jobs. More than 1.2 million applications were submitted for just 17,000 graduate roles in the U.K. last year, per The U.K.'s Institute for Student Employers. Meanwhile, the number of job openings have decreased nearly 10% on the year to 729,000 in the September to November period from a year ago, the ONS found. There were 2.5 unemployed people per vacancy between August and October, up from 1.8 the previous year. It's not just the economic climate, with employers and experts saying that Gen Z are not adequately prepared to join the workforce. Milburn told The Times in a recent interview that employers find that young people \"aren't work ready\" when they enter full-time jobs after school. \"Young people don't necessarily have work experience, and what they have learnt at school isn't necessarily pertinent for the world of work.\" Generation Lockdown U.K.-based charity Shaw Trust helps people find employment and is working to end the NEETs crisis. Chief Impact Officer Julie Leonard broke down how virtual learning and being at home during the 2020 lockdown created a socialization gap in Gen Z, particularly between the ages of 20 and 24, in an interview with CNBC Make It. \"You've got a lot of young people who missed out on years of in person, education, work experience, work readiness, soft skills, and who now find themselves adults and in a very difficult job market, and also in a recruitment landscape that has completely changed over the years,\" Leonard said. Soft skills like learning to lead a team, collaboration, following instructions are \"so core to being work-ready,\" and Gen Z \"missed out.\"Many young people weren't forced to get out of their comfort zone at home, which includes talking to strangers, showing up on time for school or work, she added. MP Milburn explained that young people can't be blamed for not being ready to work and said opportunities for young people are in \"sharp decline.\" \"There's been a longstanding decline in 16 and 17-year-olds getting Saturday jobs,\" Milburn said, in comments reported by The Times. \"Previous generations, including mine, were all brought up where most of us had that type of job or had a paper round or whatever. That not only provided youngsters with the opportunity to earn but it also allowed teenagers to learn about what it meant to be in a workplace.Leonard says these part time jobs such as babysitting, gardening, or being on the paper route were \"critical\" to getting young people familiar with the discipline of work. \"We've lost that kind of stepping stone approach that is so critical,\" she said. In fact, employers at Big Four firms like KPMG and PWC have identified that their youngest recruits are lacking essential work etiquette skills like communication and collaboration. PWC started offering resilience training to toughen up its new graduate recruits in 2025 and pinned the lack of \"human-skills\" on the pandemic. In 2023, KPMG started offering soft skill sessions for young recruits including on teamwork and how to give presentations. Ask for jobs in-person Leonard recommends going back to old-school tactics to secure jobs, rather than sitting behind a screen and sending off an endless number of CVs that will eventually be rejected by AI.Indeed, now that job hunting has become primarily digital, many young people are sending off CVs written by AI. \"It's become so depersonalized, and they send off the email, they often get no response whatsoever, which is extremely demotivating,\" Leonard said. Walk into your local shop and ask for a job, advises Julie Leonard, chief impact officer at Shaw Trust. Timnewman | E+ | Getty Images\"Actually, what you do is you make a CV, you go down the high street, you have somebody walk with you and give you that resilience and that confidence to go and say 'I would like a job,'\" she advised saying that this is an exercize Shaw Trust advisors often carry out with young people. The kind of shop where this tactic might be most successful includes local mom-and-pop busineses, bars, cafes, or other small and medium enterprizes. \"You go in there with your CV, you have a conversation with a manager, you start to open doors. That's the type of work that we do. It's the hand holding, the resilience, the confidence building to step out. It's not sitting behind a laptop and just sending CVs,\" Leonard added. ",

    "body": "watch nowPresident Donald Trump met Friday afternoon with more than a dozen oil companies at the White House to discuss plans for investment in Venezuela, less than a week after the U.S. ousted President Nicolás Maduro.Exxon CEO Darren Woods, ConocoPhillips CEO Ryan Lance and Chevron Vice Chairman Mark Nelson attended. Executives from Halliburton, Valero and Marathon were also present among others. Trump said oil companies will spend at least $100 billion to rebuild Venezuela's energy sector. The U.S. will provide security and protection so \"they get their money back and make a very nice return,\" he said. The U.S. will decide which oil companies enter Venezuela, the president said. The White House will \"cut a deal with the companies\" Friday or shortly thereafter, he said.   \"One of the things the United States gets out of this will be even lower energy prices,\" Trump said.The White House called the meeting, an industry source told CNBC. It was not scheduled at the request of the oil companies, the source said.Venezuela has the largest proven crude oil reserves in the world at 303 billion barrels or about 17% of the global total, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. But its oil sector is in dire disrepair. Production has declined from a peak of about 3.5 million barrels per day in the 1990s to only around 800,000 bpd today, according to data from energy consulting firm Kpler. Rystad Energy estimates it will cost more than $180 billion through 2040 for Venezuelan production to reach 3 million bpd. Working with ChevronThe Trump administration has provided few details on how it will encourage oil companies to make large investments in a country with history of nationalizing industry assets. Chevron is the only U.S. oil company currently operating in Venezuela through a joint venture with state oil company Petróleos de Venezuela, or PDVSA. Energy Secretary Chris Wright told CNBC Wednesday that the U.S. is working closely with Chevron.\"Chevron is on the ground, so we're getting daily updates,\" Wright told CNBC. \"They're actually working [under] this regime. So with them, how can we provide incremental tweaks or changes to allow their model to grow even more,\" the energy secretary said.  Venezuelan production could grow by several hundred thousand barrels per day in the short to medium term with small capital deployments, Wright said. Exxon, Conoco doubtsBut Exxon and Conoco will need reassurances to return to Venezuela, Wright said. The companies exited the country after former President Hugo Chavez seized their assets in 2007. They have billions of dollars in outstanding claims against the government they won in arbitration cases.\"We've had our assets seized there twice, and so you can imagine, to re-enter a third time would require some pretty significant changes from what we've historically seen,\" Exxon's Woods said. Wright said the debts Venezuela owes Exxon and Conoco need to be repaid at some point but are not an immediate priority for the Trump administration. The White House is focused on stabilizing Venezuela's economy through oil sales, the energy secretary said. \"We're trying to engineer a transition of Venezuela to a place that Americans want to do business in, want to invest new capital in, want to grow new partnerships with,\"  Wright said.But it is unclear whether the White House can convince companies like Exxon and Conoco to return to Venezuela without a dramatic change in government in Caracas.\"The big oil companies who move slowly, who have corporate boards, are not interested,\" Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Thursday at the Economic Club of Minnesota. \"I can tell you that the independent oil companies and individuals, wildcatters — our phones are ringing off the hook,\" Bessent said. \"They want to get to Venezuela yesterday.\" Leveraging oil salesThe U.S. has taken control of Venezuela's oil exports to pressure the government in Caracas, Wright said. Venezuela will ship tens of millions of barrels to the U.S., which the Trump administration will then sell, holding the proceeds in U.S.-controlled accounts, the energy secretary said. \"We need to have that leverage and that control of those oil sales to drive the changes that simply must happen in Venezuela,\" Wright said. The energy secretary said the U.S. is not stealing Venezuela's oil. The proceeds from the sales will be used to benefit the nation of 30 million, he said. Trump said Wednesday that the revenue from the oil will be used to purchase U.S.-made products.\"I have just been informed that Venezuela is going to be purchasing ONLY American Made Products, with the money they receive from our new Oil Deal,\" the president wrote on social media Wednesday. Purchases will include agricultural products, medicine, medical devices and equipment to modernize Venezuela's energy sector.\"In other words, Venezuela is committing to doing business with the United States of America as their principal partner,\" Trump said.

    "body": "watch nowThe U.S. labor market ended 2025 on a soft note, with job creation in December less than expected, according to a report Friday from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.Nonfarm payrolls rose a seasonally adjusted 50,000 for the month, lower than the downwardly revised 56,000 in November and short of the Dow Jones estimate for 73,000. At the same time, the unemployment rate fell to 4.4%, compared with the forecast for 4.5%. A more encompassing measure that includes discouraged workers and those holding part-time jobs for economic reasons dropped to 8.4%, down 0.3 percentage point from November. The household survey, which is used to calculate the unemployment figures, showed an increase of 232,000 while the labor force participation rate edged lower to 62.4%.The report presented a muddy view of the labor market, with companies reporting a low level of hiring but households showing employment gains. Stock market futures gained following the release while Treasury yields were stable.In addition, revisions brought totals down for the prior months. The November total saw a slight downward revision of 8,000 to the payrolls number, while October's loss was even more than originally reported, now at 173,000 compared with the prior estimate of 105,000.For the full year, payroll gains averaged 49,000 a month, compared with 168,000 in 2024, according to the BLS.\"The jobs report is a mixed bag, with both positive and negative aspects,\" said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B. Riley Wealth. \"We continue to see an environment where companies are slow to hire and slow to fire. The overarching takeaway in today's report is that there is more good news than bad in the first on-time jobs report in three months.\"watch nowPrior reports had been delayed due to the government shutdown, which saw data collection and reports suspended during the 43-day impasse.Restaurant and bar jobs led the month, rising 27,000, while health care added 21,000 and social assistance increased by 17,000. Retail reported a decline of 25,000. Government added just 2,000 jobs for the month.Average hourly earnings rose 0.3% for the month, in line with the forecast, although the annual increase of 3.8% was 0.2 percentage point higher than expected. The average workweek edged lower to 34.2 hours.Federal Reserve officials have been watching the jobs picture closely for guidance on the future path of interest rates.The annual payrolls gain of 584,000 for 2025 is the worst year outside of a recession since 2003, according to Heather Long, chief economist at Navy Federal Credit Union.\"It's fair to say that 2025 was a hiring recession in the United States,\" Long wrote. \"The United States is experiencing a jobless boom where growth is strong, but hiring is not. It's a great scenario for Wall Street, but an uneasy feeling on Main Street.\"Despite some clamoring for additional rate cuts on top of the three the Fed approved in the latter part of last year, the economy looked in fairly solid shape as a tumultuous year came to a close.The Atlanta Fed's rolling measure of incoming economic data is pointing to gross domestic product increasing at a 5.4% annualized pace in the fourth quarter. That comes off a third quarter in which the broad growth measure rose at a 4.3% rate.In addition, consumers, who power two-thirds of the $31 trillion U.S. economy, spent heavily during the holiday season. Adobe estimates that online spending rose 6.8% from a year ago to a record-setting $257.8 billion.Markets expect the Fed to stay on hold for a period following the succession of cuts that began in September. The next reduction is not priced in until June, though that could change following the payrolls report.The report caps a tumultuous year for the BLS. President Donald Trump in August, angry over a weak payrolls report for July and large revisions to prior months, fired former Commissioner Erika McEntarfer and replaced her with William J. Wiatrowski. In addition, the shutdown posed data collection challenges for the bureau. Markets expect the January report will present a cleaner view of the labor picture.watch now",

    "body": "watch nowSAN FRANCISCO — Daniela Amodei has an energy that's hard to place — warm, unhurried, immediately present. She swept into a sunlit room on the ground floor of Anthropic's headquarters in December, sat down, and immediately apologized for her mug.\"Is my, like, gigantic novelty mug going to be distracting if I have it?\" she said. \"I'll defer to the wise camera people in terms of what's in the shot.\"It was a disarming kind of normal for someone operating at this level.Five years ago, she and her brother, Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei, led an exodus from OpenAI.They took a core group of senior researchers and started Anthropic with a contrarian bet: That safety and business success weren't in tension, that the real money wasn't in viral consumer products, and that the artificial intelligence race would be won by the company that knew when to slow down.\"We really just felt more like we were running towards something than running away from something,\" Daniela said of the decision to leave. The co-founders had known each other for years before OpenAI. Her brother and co-founders Tom Brown and Chris Olah worked together at Google Brain. Others overlapped at various labs. watch nowAnthropic's headquarters is on \"AI Alley\" in San Francisco, a 230,000-square-foot glass high-rise in the shadow of Salesforce Tower. The neighborhood is a corridor of startups and tech giants reshaping the American economy from a handful of downtown blocks.Anthropic is now valued at $183 billion and on track to nearly double that, according to a newly signed term sheet, with Microsoft and Nvidia joining its cap table. Revenue has grown ten times annually for three consecutive years, thanks in large part to the fact that the company's AI assistant, Claude, has become the model of choice for enterprises that care about reliability as much as capability.Daniela Amodei mentioned, almost in passing, that Claude once helped diagnose her with a bacterial infection after multiple doctors missed it.With her human-scale, here-and-now energy, she is by most counts the opposite of the AI founder archetype personified by OpenAI's Sam Altman and Tesla/xAI CEO Elon Musk.Even her brother is a version of the technical visionary who speaks in timelines to superintelligence and treats interviews like TED talks.But Daniela Amodei is different.If her brother is the one looking for a path to the horizon, she is pouring the foundation that lets him get there.watch nowAnthropic vs. OpenAIIn November 2022, OpenAI fired the starting gun in the AI race. ChatGPT, a free chatbot anyone could talk to, went viral instantly, hitting 100 million users in two months. Google scrambled. Microsoft went all in. The entire tech industry lurched into motion.But Anthropic didn't sprint. From the start, Anthropic was defined by a contrarian posture toward OpenAI: move slower, ship later, and optimize for trust.While ChatGPT became a flashy consumer toy, the Amodeis made a different bet. They believed that the real money wasn't in viral moments, but in the less glamorous enterprise buildout behind them. It was in Fortune 500 contracts, developer tools, and APIs sold to companies where reliability, security, and compliance are mission critical.\"I wouldn't necessarily say that we knew for sure,\" Daniela Amodei told CNBC about the enterprise bet. \"Anthropic, as an organization, is well suited to be a B2B company. We really care about things like reliability and security and safety. That's baked into our DNA.\" Gil Luria, an analyst at D.A. Davidson, said the AI frontier has shifted toward real work — coding, math, science — the kinds of tasks companies will actually pay for. \"The frontier isn't about making our chat better,\" he said, pointing to Anthropic's strength with developers, where Claude has built a reputation as a top-tier programming model, outpacing key rivals in many users' workflows.watch nowEven back in 2020, Daniela Amodei said the team could see a future where Claude would handle many of the high-intelligence tasks humans do at work. \"And we thought, that's a pretty big market.\"Anthropic said its business customer base has grown from under 1,000 to more than 300,000 in two years, and nearly 80% of Claude activity now comes from outside the United States. The customer list reads like a who's who of global enterprise, with Novo Nordisk, the Norwegian sovereign wealth fund — the world's largest — plus Bridgewater, Stripe, and Slack, all running Claude at scale.Sameer Dholakia, a partner at Bessemer Ventures who invested in Anthropic, said the bet made sense for one simple reason: enterprise customers don't churn the way consumers do. \"We really love the focus that they had, and candidly, the focus of Anthropic on safety and trust, we knew was going to play really well with the enterprise buyer, and that's proven to be true.\"While OpenAI still leads in scale and cultural cachet, with ChatGPT a household name boasting nearly 900 million weekly active users, Anthropic is closing the gap fast — and in some areas is already ahead.Today, Anthropic's revenue is roughly 85% business. OpenAI is more than 60% consumer.\"One of the values and the things that we talk about a lot internally is just how not to believe the hype,\" Daniela Amodei told CNBC. \"For us, it's never been about seeking attention or sort of being in the headlines. We're really here to do the work.\"watch now\"As Anthropic goes, so goes generative AI,\" said Alex Kantrowitz, founder of the independent publication Big Technology. \"They have the most pure bet on this technology working. If Anthropic is able to make it work, all of GenAI is going to work. And if not, we're going to have some serious problems.\"Anthropic's lead in enterprise is proving durable. And it's a lead the Amodei siblings have built together.\"It's genuinely a privilege to run Anthropic with my sibling,\" Daniela Amodei said. \"We've known each other our whole lives — or my whole life, at least. He had four years without me, poor guy.\"\"Dario and I really help each other,\" she added. \"He's great at pushing me to think about the big picture... I am helpful in thinking about, like, how do we build an organization that is enduring, that's sustainable, that's filled with great people who really want to do the type of work that we set out to do five years ago.\"watch nowThere's always more work to do, Amodei said, and the models are getting exponentially smarter.She framed it as a lesson from the last generation of tech: If social media companies could go back in time, knowing what their platforms would unleash, would they have done anything differently? Anthropic, she said, is trying to answer that question now: \"To talk about the risks and try to mitigate them\" while it still can.Daniela Amodei is betting it can.

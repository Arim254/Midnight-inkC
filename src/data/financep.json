    "body": "For many Americans, buying your first home feels like a rite of passage. And while rising home prices and high mortgage rates may make it more difficult to put down roots, there are still favorable markets for first-time buyers that are close to major metropolitan areas like Washington, D.C., and Cleveland, Ohio.A recent report from Realtor.com ranks the best markets for first-time homebuyers. To determine the top markets, the report analyzed over 10,000 locations within the 100 largest metropolitan areas in the U.S., giving each a score out of 10 based on the following components: Affordability (25%)Local amenities (25%)Housing availability (10%)Young peers (10%)Commute quality (10%)Economic health (10%)Housing outlook (10%) Realtor.com then determined the 10 highest-ranking markets with at least 500 active for-sale listings from December 2024 to November 2025. Many of the markets from last year's ranking performed well this year and remain good options for first-time buyers, including Granite City, Illinois, and Birmingham, Alabama, Joel Berner, senior economist at Realtor.com, tells CNBC Make It. \"Affordability remains good, the amenities in the cities remain good and the fact that these prices are remaining attainable for younger owners or would-be owners is really impressive,\" Berner says. On the other hand, this year's ranking saw all Florida markets drop out of the top 10 best places for first-time homebuyers. Berner says the overall Realtor.com forecast for 2026, in terms of price and sales growth, is weak in Florida markets. \"We're expecting a pretty slow year in 2026 in Florida,\" Berner says. \"Even though there are good options there, we don't recommend those this year because we anticipate those homes actually falling in value.\" The report states that the fall in the value of Florida homes is due to softer prices and home sales projections. \"The main driver of price softness in Florida over the past several years is a growing supply of homes for sale at the same time that demand for those homes has weakened a bit,\" Berner said in a 2025 report. Rochester, N.Y., is the No. 1 market for first-time homebuyers Rochester, New York.Copyright Matt Kazmierski | Moment | Getty ImagesRochester, New York, ranked as the top market for first-time homebuyers with a score of 9.3. The median listing price for a home in the New York city is $139,900, which is below the national median of $399,950, according to Realtor.com. Realtor.com forecasts that in 2026, 25- to 34-year-olds will make up 21.3% of homeowners in Rochester. \"Rochester has quite a fair share of listings on the market, so there are a lot of options for buyers,\" Berner says. \"It's a nice town that is also a good place to raise a family.\"The best markets for first-time homebuyersRochester, N.Y.Harrisburg, Pa.Granite City, Ill.Birmingham, Ala.North Little Rock, Ark.Syracuse, N.Y.Baltimore, Md. St. Louis Park, Minn.Pittsburgh, Pa.Garfield Heights, OhioHarrisburg, Pennsylvania, ranked second among the top markets for first-time homebuyers in 2026 with a score of 9.3. The median listing price for a home in Harrisburg is $151,999.Harrisburg, PennsylvaniaRichard T. Nowitz | The Image Bank | Getty ImagesSimilar to Rochester, Berner says Harrisburg is seeing significant growth and offers options for buyers. \"They have more inventory than most places in that part of the country,\" he adds. Having so many midsize markets in the top 10, Berner says, points to the fact that these markets are becoming more popular than really big cities, but aren't necessarily totally rural areas. \"There are a lot of opportunities for young homebuyers to be part of that trend and build up some of these cities even further with young families,\" he says.

    "body": "About a decade ago, Andy Hill was looking for a change.  Hill, now 44, was feeling burnt out at his job in corporate events marketing. While the frequent travel and weekend events were fun while Hill was in his 20s, the gig had begun to lose its luster after he got married and started a family.In 2016, Hill started a side gig hosting the \"Marriage Kids and Money\" podcast, where he and his guests discussed their journeys and stories around family finances. It was around this time that he became interested in FIRE, which is short for \"financial independence, retire early.\"The strategy generally involves saving a high percentage of your income in service of aggressively investing. Save enough, and you can either buy income-producing investments, such as real estate, or begin withdrawing from your stock portfolio to replace income from a 9-to-5 job. Hill was all in. \"I was very interested in FIRE, like traditional FIRE, hard-charging, get me out of here,\" Hill tells CNBC Make It, referring to an early model of FIRE that prioritized slashing expenses to maximize savings and retire quickly. \"I want to save as much as possible, and I don't care what happens now. That did not work well for my life.\"Hill and his wife were saving upwards of 50% of their dual income, often cutting out many of life's niceties to do it. They shopped at lower-cost grocery stores and sold anything around the house they determined they didn't need. If family, friends or colleagues invited them to events that didn't align with a strict budget, they said, \"no thanks.\"In many ways, it worked — the couple wiped out $50,000 in debt and built a portfolio worth $500,000. But when Hill suggested saving even more in order to retire as quickly as he could, money discussions started turning into money fights, he says. \"We did the 'super saver' thing for a while, and that led us into marriage counseling,\" Hill says.Talking in counseling gave Hill and his wife a new approach to managing their marriage — one built on compromise, communication and empathizing with each other's feelings. They also took on a new approach to money, what he and some other financial pros call \"Coast FIRE\": Once you save enough such that your portfolio can grow to where you want it in retirement, you take your foot off the gas, savings-wise, and \"coast.\" It's a philosophy he shares in his new book, \"Own Your Time: 10 Financial Steps to Put Your Family First and Escape the Corporate Grind.\" For couples in particular, he says, taking this approach allows you spend more money — or time — pursuing the things you value in life together. \"[It's about] starting from that position of dreaming personally and then sharing those dreams with your spouse, asking them to do the same, so that you can come together for some cool family goals that work for both of you,\" Hill says. Finding middle groundHill discovered that his aggressive FIRE strategy meant sacrificing on both ends. Not only was the pressure to cut back on spending limiting what the family could do, but his hope to bank as much money as possible meant that work was taking him away from the people he loved.\"I was traveling during my children's birthdays, working with supervisors that graded my performance on how late I could stay at the office and overall, I was giving a lot more time to work than to my health or my family,\" he says.Still, abandoning the strategy seemingly threw a wrench into Hill's hopes of leaving his job for good — his plan was to save enough to invest in rental properties for passive income, he says. Hill's wife suggested that he take the money he'd been saving for rental property and use it to turn his side hustle — something he enjoyed much more than his day job — into a full-fledged business. \"It was this epiphany moment,\" he says. Rather than waiting for the early retirement finish line, he could use some of his savings to buy time and space to pursue his passion. Hill kept his podcast and added financial coaching and speaking engagements, going into business for himself full time in 2020. When he left his job, he was making about $180,000 a year working 40 to 50 hours a week. These days, he pays himself about $100,000, but works about 20 to 25 hours a week. As for his savings rate, \"We found a middle ground,\" Hill says. \"We said, 'Well, we can continue to save and invest, but maybe let's dial it back by like a cool 20, 25% and then dial some of that back into our lifestyle.'\"Unlocking time freedomHill says his shift to a Coast FIRE lifestyle allowed him and his wife to focus on time freedom. If you can build enough of a retirement nest egg, the thinking goes, you can let it grow on the back burner and use money you would have been socking away to enrich your life, either in the form of spending more or finding a different approach to work. \"Do we want to inflate our lifestyle and just have more fun, or do we both want to work less?\" Hill says. \"Wouldn't it be cool to work 20 to 25 hours a week until we're in our 60s and then just enjoy more time now?\"Hill and his wife have both taken the latter approach. The couple had about $500,000 saved by age 40, and have since pumped their net worth up to over $1 million. They've used their financial flexibility to scale back at work. While Hill built his business, his wife realized that she was tired of working for clients at all hours at her marketing agency. \"She said, 'I've always wanted to work with my hands. I've always wanted to do something where when the work day was done, I was done,'\" Hill says. So she went back to school to become an esthetician. Now she works part-time at a dermatologist's office and goes back to her own life when the office closes. The goal, Hill says, is to find the balance between saving for the future and living a fulfilling life now. The two spend Mondays sipping coffee after sending the kids to school and exercising together. Hill cooks family dinner twice a week. They've taken dance classes together and are learning pickleball. \"With that extra 20 to 25 hours that we're not working, we can take care of our health,\" Hill says. \"We can invest time in our marriage so that we're actually having conversations with each other and not being surprised by arguments. We can be more present parents and be there for the important moments for our kids.\"Want to get ahead at work with AI?

    "body": "Delroy Lindo, finally an Academy Award-nominated actor, only had to wait five decades to earn the honor — overcoming \"strategic missteps\" that once threatened to derail his career along the way, he's said.Lindo, 73, is a longtime character actor whose appearances on film, television and stage have earned him critical acclaim, even as his industry's highest honors eluded him. On Thursday, Lindo earned his first Oscar nomination, in the Best Supporting Actor category, for his work in the 2025 blockbuster \"Sinners.\" The nomination comes five years after some of the actor's supporters complained that he'd been \"snubbed\" by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences for his work in the Spike Lee film \"Da 5 Bloods.\"Lindo was \"profoundly disappointed\" by getting shut out of the 2021 Oscar nominations for that role, he told Entertainment Weekly on Thursday. Lee, an Oscar-winner himself, also expressed disappointment over Lindo's lack of awards recognition, commenting in March 2021 on Instagram that it \"does not take away from the impact of his work that spans decades.\"Before his Oscars nomination, the actor had a long, well-respected career that included acclaimed performances in notable films such as \"The Cider House Rules\" and the Lee-directed \"Malcolm X\" and \"Crooklyn.\" Still, Lindo has lamented his career floundering for multiple years in the mid-1990s as he developed a reputation as being a \"difficult\" actor to work with, he's said.\"I made some strategic missteps. One of the biggest missteps was probably thinking that I was important,\" Lindo told The Hollywood Reporter in March 2021, discussing why high-profile roles \"dried up\" for him nearly three decades ago. He'd bring passion and intensity to his work, occasionally leading him to butt heads with directors when their creative visions didn't fully align, he said.At one point, Lindo walked away from a Lee-produced film over concerns about the script, leading to a nearly 25-year pause between collaborations for the actor and director, Lindo told GQ in April 2021. He might've walked away from acting altogether if fellow actor Denzel Washington hadn't talked him out of the idea, telling Lindo he was \"too good\" an actor to quit, Lindo said at a \"Sinners\" screening in December 2025, according to Deadline.\"That period had to do with these various missteps that I made, which resulted in perhaps being seen as less viable as a film actor, less desirable,\" Lindo told GQ. \"Was that frustrating and painful? Absolutely. I was playing catch-up.\"Ultimately, Lindo came to the realization that he needed to adjust his approach to collaboration, rather than hoping his acting talent would be enough to keep landing him high-profile work, he told THR.\"I thought it was a meritocracy, that good work would beget more good work. No, not quite,\" said Lindo. \"I also was not as strategic or as diplomatic as I could have been in certain situations. I needed to communicate in a way that could not be perceived as either ungrateful or bigheaded.\"Communication expert: 'Don't think of them as conflict conversations'Effective communication is a key skill that can make or break anyone's career, some experts say. Mastering the art of having tough conversations at work — like raising a constructive criticism with a colleague or respectfully disagreeing with your boss — can help you get ahead in your career without alienating others, workplace expert Henna Pryor told CNBC Make It on Aug. 21.Try reframing those conversations as opportunities to seek clarity, rather than as confrontations, Pryor recommended. \"So much comes down to how we prime and frame [conversations],\" she said. \"I don't think of them as conflict conversations. I think of them as clarify conversations. I am seeking clarity about an issue, about why we're disagreeing.\"Lindo didn't specify exactly how he's adapted his approach to be more diplomatic when expressing his creative opinions at work, but he's returned to landing notable acting roles. In addition to his roles in \"Da 5 Bloods\" and \"Sinners,\" Lindo also landed a recurring role on the Emmy Award-nominated Paramount+ series \"The Good Fight\" between 2017 and 2021.Now, Lindo is up for an award that many actors spend their entire lives and careers chasing. After enduring the ups and downs of his own career, Lindo says he's still letting the honor sink in.\"It feels terrific,\" Lindo said on ABC's \"Good Morning America\" on Friday. \"I'm still processing, if I'm really honest, but it's wonderful.\"Want to get ahead at work with AI?

Stock Market Value: ~$3.16B ($53.08 per share) Activist: Engaged Capital  Ownership: 2.02% Average Cost: n/a Activist Commentary: Engaged Capital was founded by Glenn Welling, a former principal and managing director at Relational Investors. Engaged is an experienced and successful small-cap investor and makes investments with a two-to-five-year investment horizon. Its style is holding management and boards accountable behind closed doors. Engaged has an average return of 20.56% versus 17.83% for the Russell 2000. Of the firm's 39 past activist campaigns, nine of them have been at companies in the information technology sector.What's happeningOn Oct. 30, 2025, Engaged sent a letter calling on the BlackLine's board to immediately engage financial advisors and proactively run a strategic alternatives process following renewed acquisition interest from SAP SE. Nearly a month later, Engaged issued a so-called 220 Demand letter requesting access to board and strategic committee records related to all inbound acquisition interest, including a reported $66 per share offer from SAP SE on June 18, 2025. Earlier this month, Engaged announced that it plans to nominate the following four director candidates for election to BlackLine's board at the 2026 Annual Meeting: (i) Christopher Hetrick, director of research at Engaged Capital; (ii) Christopher Young, former head of contested situations at Jefferies; (iii) Christopher Hallenbeck, former senior vice president at SAP SE; and (iv) Storm Duncan, founder of technology-focused M&A advisory firm Ignatious.Behind the scenesBlackLine provides financial accounting solutions delivered primarily as Software as a Service (SaaS). This is a very prototypical enterprise software business, characterized by high gross margins (80%) and sticky offerings that are essential for large enterprises. Its largest of these clients is SAP SE, with whom BlackLine has a strategic partnership that contributes approximately 30% of the company's revenue. Historically, the business was focused on growth, and rightfully so, as it was compounding revenue at over 20% annually for many years, and the stock price grew along with that success. By the end of 2020 BlackLine was trading around $133, and Marc Huffman, who led the company through the global pandemic, was promoted from president to CEO, replacing founder Therese Tucker who took on the role of executive chair of the board. However, post Covid, growth began to decelerate, margins did not come up meaningfully to compensate, and the stock fell accordingly, trading as low as roughly $61 in December 2022.BlackLine was rumored to have been thrown a life raft in 2022, when Clearlake Capital, a private equity firm known for taking positions in select technology companies as a prelude to an acquisition offer, took a roughly 9% public position in BlackLine. There was also speculation that this development piqued the interest of SAP. This seemed like perfect timing: BlackLine's hyper growth had severely slowed and multiples in the space were as high as ever. It is hard to know what type of discussions go on in a boardroom, but an acquisition never happened. In March 2023, Huffman was replaced when Tucker returned to the company in a co-CEO structure with former Deloitte consultant Owen Ryan (until October 2025 when he was made sole CEO). Since Tucker's return, growth has continued to decline to high single digits and while margins have improved modestly, the company's stock is down another 24%. Despite all of this, history repeated itself when it was recently reported that SAP made an offer to acquire BlackLine in June, this time for $66 per share, an over 30% premium to the 60-day trading average at the time. At the time, the company's growth rate was also much lower than it was in 2022, and industry multiples have compressed significantly. BlackLine, despite creating no value in public markets over the last several years, reportedly rejected the approach.This refusal is what prompted Engaged Capital to send a letter calling on the BlackLine board to immediately engage financial advisors and proactively run a strategic alternatives process following renewed acquisition interest from SAP. Engaged is not advocating for a sale of the company at any price, nor does the board have a legal duty to engage every acquisition offer. But conscientious shareholders certainly have the right to question how a board addresses a potential material transaction, particularly when they feel the board is not acting in the best interest of shareholders. Activist investors like Engaged do not view this as a right but an obligation. So, Engaged is asking the board to evaluate the SAP offer and weigh it against any other offers and on a risk-adjusted basis against a standalone path. This request is reasonable under almost any circumstances, but even more so when the potential acquirer is the company's most important business relationship. While SAP may be the most logical partner, and likely the one ultimately willing to pay the biggest premium (estimated to be in the mid-70s). Given their existing strategic partnership, BlackLine meets the profile of an ideal fit for private equity. With stable reoccurring revenue and modest growth, the value here is all in the margins, and PE firms have consistently demonstrated their ability to build software businesses with 20% EBITDA margins, like BlackLine, and expand them upwards of 40% once private, such as Vista/Blackstone at Smartsheet and Francisco Partners/TPG at New Relic. Notably, Clearlake Capital continues to own a 9.6% position in BlackLine. The firm has taken similar positions in companies like Cornerstone OnDemand, which it acquired in 2021, and Blackbaud, which rejected Clearlake's takeout offer in March 2023 and then again in 2024.A lot has happened since Engaged first presented this thesis last October. Shortly thereafter, BlackLine disclosed that it has maintained an independent strategic committee of the board for more than a year, with members including David Henshall, who is serving as chairperson, Greg Hughes and Tom Unterman. Notably, Henshall has a history of getting companies sold as a director, including New Relic when it was engaged by Engaged. Following this announcement, Engaged issued a 220 Demand letter to the company requesting access to board and strategic committee records related to all inbound acquisition interest, including a reported $66 per share offer from SAP SE on June 18, 2025. Engaged expressed concerns about the disclosures around the company's strategic committee, noting that BlackLine only recently revealed the committee's existence and has still not disclosed key information around it, including when it was formed, its purpose, the scope, its authority and whether it has retained advisors. Earlier this month, Engaged announced that it plans to nominate the following four director candidates for election at the company's 2026 Annual Meeting: (i) Christopher Hetrick, director of research at Engaged Capital; (ii) Christopher Young, former head of contested situations at Jefferies; (iii) Christopher Hallenbeck, former SVP at SAP SE; and (iv) Storm Duncan, founder of technology -focused M&A advisory firm Ignatious.When assessing Engaged's chances of success in a proxy fight, there are several dynamics to consider. First, in late December, Unterman announced that he will not stand for re-election as a member of the board at the company's 2026 Annual Meeting. His impending departure creates both a board vacancy in a seat up for election in 2026, so at worst for Engaged, it will be running its slate of four against three incumbents and a new nominee. Second, Engaged will likely get the support of Clearlake (9.6%), one of the company's largest shareholders. Third, there are signs of shareholder discontent, as CEO Ryan received over 20% withhold votes last time he was up for election. Finally, and most significant, one of the four directors up for election is founder Therese Tucker. If she sees the smallest sign of being ousted from the company she founded, it could lead to a quick settlement or a sale of the company. BlackLine added two new directors in June and July of 2025, which the company will undoubtedly argue is evidence of good corporate governance and board refreshment. However, these directors are in the class up for re-election in 2027, and good corporate governance would dictate that they are voted on in the 2026 election so not to be on the board for two years without shareholder approval. This is something we used to see more of and certainly will not see amid a proxy fight. Finally, it is important to note that one of the directors up for election this year is Scott Davidson who was appointed to the board last year as part of the Scalar Gauge settlement. By targeting him, Engaged cannot necessarily rely on Scalar Gauge's support, but that firm only owns a 1.15% stake.Ken Squire is the founder and president of 13D Monitor, an institutional research service on shareholder activism, and the founder and portfolio manager of the 13D Activist Fund, a mutual fund that invests in a portfolio of activist investments.",

    "body": "US President Donald Trump speaks to the press upon returning to Joint Base Andrews in Maryland on January 13, 2026. Mandel Ngan | Afp | Getty ImagesPresident Donald Trump on Saturday warned Canada that the U.S. would impose 100% tariff on goods sold in the U.S. if the country strikes a trade deal with China.\"If Canada makes a deal with China, it will immediately be hit with a 100% Tariff against all Canadian goods and products coming into the U.S.A.,\" the president wrote in a Truth Social post.Trump also suggested Saturday that China would try to use Canada to try to avoid paying U.S. tariffs. \"If Governor Carney thinks he is going to make Canada a 'Drop Off Port' for China to send goods and products into the United States, he is sorely mistaken,\" Trump stated.Earlier this month, Prime Minister Mark Carney announced that Canada and China reached a preliminary deal to remove trade barriers and lower tariffs. Under the tentative agreement, Beijing cut tariffs on some Canadian agricultural products, while Ottawa increased the quotas for imports of Chinese electric vehicles, applying the most-favored-nation tariff rate of 6.1%. Just a week ago, Trump had voiced his support for Carney on the China trade deal.\"That's what he should be doing. It's a good thing for him to sign a trade deal. If you can get a deal with China, you should do that,\" Trump told reporters at the White House on Jan. 16.\"Canada's government has transparently outlined that the agreement with China is fundamentally about domestic consumers and businesses in Canada and China, not schemes aimed at other markets,\" Matthew Holmes, executive vice president and chief of public policy of the Canadian Chamber of Commerce said in a statement.\"A structured and stable relationship with China or any other country ... are not to replace our deeply rooted relationship with the United States that continues to be overwhelmingly good for workers, consumers and North American competitiveness,\" he added.   The White House and the office of the Canadian prime minister didn't immediately respond to a CNBC request for comment.Read more CNBC politics coverageGreenland PM: Trump-NATO deal framework unclear, sovereignty is a red lineTrump sues Jamie Dimon, JPMorgan Chase over debanking the suit calls 'political'Trump says he reached Greenland deal 'framework' with NATO, backs off tariffsTrump interview live updates: CNBC's Joe Kernen sits down with the president at DavosRussia watches as ally Iran edges closer to collapse.

Duties aren't imposed on most Canadian exports under the Canada-U.S.-Mexico Agreement (CUSMA), but some goods, including steel, copper and certain autos and auto parts, are subject to U.S. tariffs. The new tariff threat comes one day after Trump withdrew the invitation to Canada to join his \"Board of Peace\" after Carney's address at the World Economic Forum in Davos that cautioned against economic coercion by the world's superpowers.In his speech, Carney said the world's \"middle powers\" must band together to resist coercion from the world's largest powers.Carney said last week that he intended to join the board but the details hadn't been worked out.

    "body": "watch nowElon Musk's pay package of up to $1 trillion highlights the continued escalation in CEO compensation, even as worker pay slows and rewards to shareholders remain mixed, according to several studies.  Already, Musk is the richest person on the planet with a net worth that tops $660 billion, according to Bloomberg. Musk saw his 2018 Tesla pay package -- now valued at over $130 billion -- reinstated in December, and his company SpaceX looks set to for a potential public offering in 2026. Those two events could well put Musk on his way to becoming the world's first trillionaire this year. In addition, his new pay package, valued at up to $1 trillion, could also start paying out over the next decade.While Musk may be an outlier, his stock-fueled gains highlight the booming compensation and wealth gains of CEOs in recent decades that has been driven by rising stock markets and a broader adoption of stock-centric pay packages Over the past 50 years, top CEO compensation has climbed 1,094%, according to the Economic Policy Institute. That compares to a 26% increase in typical worker compensation. Median total compensation for S&P 500 CEO's was $17.1 million in 2024, up nearly 10% from 2023, according to Equilar, a corporate analytics firm. CEOs now make 192 times more than the average employee, up from a 186 to 1 ratio in 2023. Tesla CEO Elon Musk attends the Saudi-U.S. Investment Forum, in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, May 13, 2025. Hamad I Mohammed | ReutersDriving the acceleration in CEO pay is a shift in the types of stock awards used to incentivize and reward corporate chiefs. CEO compensation typically includes four categories: salaries, long-term incentives, short-term incentives and perks. Long-term and short-term incentives are largely stock awards, and make up far and away the largest portion of CEO compensation. Stock awards accounted for 72% of CEO pay packages in 2024, with the median value increasing 15% that year, according to Equilar. Musk's trillion-dollar pay package, for instance, doesn't include any salary. The potential value of the $1 trillion would come entirely from stock awards pegged to various targets. For Musk to get the full payout, Tesla must hit key milestones, including certain market capitalization and operational achievements. He could still earn billions in stock even if Tesla doesn't meet all the targets.\"Milestone achievements built into CEO pay packages could be the norm in the future,\" said Amit Batish, senior director marketing at Equilar.Company boards and CEOs themselves say that because their pay is tied closely to stock performance, their compensation reflects the larger wealth created for shareholders. The CEO only does well if shareholders do well, they argue. If stocks plummet, CEO's can also see big pay drops. Others others argue that CEO's have only a partial impact on their companies' share price. A 2021 MSCI study of top executive pay between 2006 and 2020 found a weak correlation between higher CEO pay and company performance. \"This notion that the guy in the corner office is somehow almost single handedly responsible for company value, and everyone else is just little minions who don't contribute much of anything ... everyone can see that is not true,\" said Sarah Anderson, at the Institute for Policy Studies. Tesla's Optimus robots walk on the day of an unveiling event in Los Angeles, California, U.S. October 10, 2024, in this still image taken from a video.Tesla | Via ReutersAccording to the 2021 MSCI study, average performing CEO's took home only 4% less in realized pay than top-performing CEOs. More importantly, CEO's with the lowest awarded pay saw the strongest returns for shareholders.\"When we measured pay and performance against CEO tenure, we found little evidence that high CEO pay achieved this lofty goal of CEO incentivization,\" according to MSCI, an investment research firm.Since the 1990s, company boards have shifted away from stock options, which incentivize short-term performance, with stock awards, which boards argue are driven by longer-term incentives. Shareholders of publicly traded companies can now vote in an advisory capacity on CEO pay, known as \"say on pay\" votes, but company boards have final say when it comes to compensation packages.While restraining CEO pay has proven ineffective, given the natural \"ratcheting up\" of median CEO pay by board compensation committees, some economists advocate more stock awards for employees to help close the gap between employees and CEOs. Employee Stock Ownership Plans, or ESOPs, for instance, are qualified retirement plans that give employees shares in the company through a trust. Employees who can partake in ESOPs tend to end up with better financial security, said Loren Rodgers, executive director of the National Center for Employee Ownership. That in turn benefits their companies, he said. \"Employee-owned businesses are more productive,\" Rodgers said. \"They're more able to recruit people. People quit at lower rates. They're more competitive.\"Watch the video above to hear more about the uptick in CEO pay and what is driving these massive pay outs.",

    "body": "U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and Director of the United States Office of Management and Budget, Russell Vought.Kevin Mohatt | Kevin Lamarque | | ReutersSen. Elizabeth Warren on Friday accused the acting head of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau of undermining President Donald Trump's stated push to make credit cards more affordable, according to a letter obtained exclusively by CNBC.In a letter to acting CFPB Director Russell Vought, Warren, D-Mass., noted that in the last year the agency has dropped a rule limiting credit card late fees, sided with lenders in lawsuits over deceptive practices and paused enforcement actions against the industry.Earlier this month, Trump demanded in a social media post that U.S. banks voluntarily cap credit card interest rates at 10% for a year. When they didn't, Trump this week called on lawmakers to pass legislation on the issue.\"I spoke with President Trump last week and told him that Congress could pass legislation to cap credit card rates, if he would fight for it,\" Warren wrote in her letter to Vought. \"While Congress considers legislation to address the issue, your own actions are directly undermining the President's stated goals,\" she wrote. \"Under your leadership, the CPFB has taken steps to make it easier—not harder—for big banks and credit card companies to rip off Americans.\"The letter from Warren seizes on Trump's pivot to affordability and seeks to leverage his initiative against his own administration, escalating tensions over the financial regulatory agency that she helped to create under the Obama administration. Members of the Trump administration have sought to shutter the CFPB as part of a broader pro-business deregulatory agenda.Current and former CFPB employees have said the agency is on life support under Vought, who has fought in court to enact mass layoffs and stop the agency's funding.An agency spokesperson said that the CFPB was disallowed from limiting credit card rates by the Dodd Frank Act.Vought should be \"using the full scope of [the CFPB's] authorities to address excessive credit card costs and to crack down on bad actors,\" instead of trying to dismantle the agency, Warren wrote.She directed Vought to \"immediately reinstate its rule capping credit card late fees at $8, which would save Americans more than $10 billion annually,\" Warren said.She contended Vought should also tamp down on deceptive practices around the industry's deferred interest promotions, resume enforcement of rules around monitoring interest rate increases, respond to a mounting pile of consumer complaints, and halt bait-and-switch tactics with rewards programs.\"Either President Trump is not serious about making credit cards more affordable or you are insubordinately disregarding his direction,\" she wrote.watch now",

    "body": "watch nowOil prices rose Friday as President Donald Trump's renewed threats against Iran raise concerns about supply disruptions.Iran is not a major oil producer. The country pumps about 3.4 million barrels per day, according to Kpler. That number pales in comparison with the U.S. and Saudi Arabia, which pump about 13.5 million barrels per day and 9.5 million barrels per day, respectively, according to data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration and OPEC.Yet a recent wave of protests in Iran spurred by the plummet in the nation's rial currency and Trump's subsequent suggestions that the U.S. could take military action in the country have rocked energy markets.\"Oil markets are moving on fear,\" Helima Croft, global head of commodity strategy at RBC Capital Markets, told CNBC. \"It's basically a concern about disruption.\"Market anxiety grew Friday as tensions between Iran and the U.S. escalated. \"We're watching Iran,\" Trump told reporters Thursday. \"You know we have a lot of ships going in that direction just in case. We have a big flotilla going in that direction and we'll see what happens.\"Trump's comments come as more than 5,000 people have died in Iran since the protests began on Dec. 28, according to the Human Rights Activists News Agency. \"They were going to hang 837 people,\" Trump said in an interview with CNBC on Wednesday. \"And I told them, you can't do that. If you do that, it's going to be bad.\" While the market is well supplied for the time being, OPEC and its allies, which pump about 40% of the world's oil, hiked their output last year, cutting into spare capacity.\"If we were to get a confrontation between the U.S. and Iran that led to the loss of Iranian oil exports, there just isn't a lot left in the OPEC tank to cover that,\" Croft said. Concerns around a larger regional conflict have also lifted prices given Iran's proximity to some of the world's largest oil producers -- namely Saudi Arabia.\"Iran's location is strategically very important when we think about critical waterways like the Strait of Hormuz, which is a major chokepoint for oil, and we have seen Iran and Iranian-backed groups before target tankers and target critical infrastructure in the Gulf,\" said Croft. In 2019, Iran launched a series of attacks on oil tankers in the Strait of Hormuz. About 20% of global crude flows through the narrow waterway, according to the EIA.Despite pulling back threats of military intervention, Trump confirmed to CNBC on Wednesday that 25% tariffs on countries doing business with Iran are \"going forward.\"Existing sanctions on Iran have already hampered the country's crude exports, with the vast majority going to independent Chinese refiners that buy the oil at a discount to benchmark prices.\"Can you really squeeze Iran much more given where their barrels are going?\" said Croft. \"[Have] sanctions now lost [the] ability to kind of move the needle when it comes to Iranian policy?\"Watch the video above to learn more about Iran's impact on oil markets and what it could mean for consumers.",

    "body": "Fiordaliso | Moment | Getty ImagesOver the last few years, Emma Kobil, a trauma counselor in Denver, started noticing a new topic coming up with her patients: artificial intelligence. \"I've had clients lose their jobs due to AI, and it's something we've processed in our sessions,\" Kobil said. Often, they express \"shock, disbelief and fear about navigating a changing career landscape where their skills are no longer needed,\" she said. Other therapists said the technology is also vexing their patients. \"What I hear most often is a fear of becoming obsolete,\" said Harvey Lieberman, a clinical psychologist in New York. \"People start questioning their judgment, their choices or their future.\" More than a third — or 38% — of workers said they worry AI will make some or all of their job duties outdated in the future, according to a July 2025 survey by the American Psychological Association. These fears are not unfounded, said Rhiannon Batchelder, a career coach based in Denver. \"Some employees are being asked to create pitches for how AI can take over portions of their job,\" Batchelder said. \"Among news of mass layoffs while CEO pay continues to rise, being replaced by technology just feels like another reason to lose hope in the possibility of a stable, fulfilling career.\" AI was a major factor leading to nearly 55,000 layoffs in the U.S. in 2025, according to December data from consulting firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas. Overall, around 1.2 million jobs were cut in the year. Meanwhile, a recent Massachusetts Institute of Technology study found that AI can already replace around 11% of the U.S. labor market. Salesforce's CEO, Marc Benioff, said 4,000 customer support workers had been let go because artificial intelligence was already doing 50% of the work at the company. Other companies that pointed to AI in recent restructuring moves were tech consultancy firm Accenture and airline group Lufthansa. \"People don't know where they fit into this new society,\" said Riana Elyse Anderson, a licensed clinical psychologist and associate professor at Columbia University. \"We probably don't even know the full extent of how psychologically damaging this type of replacement is.\" Here's what therapists have to say about workers' artificial intelligence anxiety, and what they may be able to do to feel better. 'Goes deeply into questions of personal value' Losing your job to AI can trigger a host of existential questions, said Ben Yalom, a San Diego-based psychotherapist. \"It may feel as if the universe is saying, 'You are no longer needed,' which may feel much more profound and disturbing than 'Our company is downsizing,' or even 'You are not doing a great job,'\" Yalom said. \"It goes deeply into questions of personal value, which is all very unsettling.\" Underneath these feelings is usually \"a younger part that's terrified of being left behind or not being 'enough,' and that fear gets amplified because the technology itself feels so fast and out of our control,\" Kobil said.

'You are so much more than your work' Workers who know or think they lost their jobs to AI — or are grappling with the changes brought on by the technology — should first \"feel the loss,\" Kobil said. \"Our society is changing quickly,\" Kobil said. \"Allow yourself to grieve and comfort the parts of you that feel shocked, hopeless and afraid right now.\" For decades, studying computer science and learning to code was \"your ticket to success,\" for a \"long, thriving career,\" Anderson said. That may no longer be the case. But the disruptive and uncertain moment can also be a chance for reflection, Anderson said. As an exercise, she recommends pausing any quest to pin down what will lead to a stable, lucrative career, \"because that might not be totally known now.\" Instead, she said, ask yourself: What do you want to do? \"Do some inventory,\" Anderson said. \"Maybe at this time, take stock of who you are.\" Some people may decide to return to school or make a career change, she added. Our society is changing quickly. Emma Kobilpsychotherapist As you ask yourself deeper questions about what you want, try to create some distance between you and your work, Kobil said. \"We all experience huge change,\" Kobil said. \"We all lose our young bodies, for example, but we are not our bodies, just like we are not our ability to write code or manage others. You are so much more than your work.\" Restoring 'a sense of agency'  While the growing role of AI in the workplace can feel overwhelming, \"retreating into avoidance or despair tends to narrow options rather than protect them,\" Lieberman said. \"Learning enough about AI to understand where it genuinely alters work, and where it does not, often restores a sense of agency,\" he said. watch nowThere are plenty of ways to start learning about the technology, including certificate programs and free opportunities, Batchelder said. \"For most workers, understanding the basics of AI will be an asset, especially as we wait to see how the technology advances,\" she said. \"During times of uncertainty, information is always powerful.\" ",

    "body": "KANGERLUSSUAQ, GREENLAND - JULY 09: Passenger planes for local flights of Air Greenland stand on the tarmac at the airport as signs show the flight times to various global destinations on July 09, 2024 in Kangerlussuaq, Greenland. (Photo by Sean Gallup/Getty Images)Sean Gallup | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesA former official of U.S. President Donald Trump's first administration is planning a multi-billion-dollar data center project in a remote corner of Greenland, as hyperscalers scramble to build out capacity across the globe to keep up with the AI rollout.The data center is aiming to be operational at 300 megawatts (MW) by mid-2027, before further expansion would see it hit 1.5 gigawatts (GW) by the end of 2028.While that's currently several times the power capacity of any active data center in the world, there are plans to build multiple 1 GW-plus facilities across the globe over the next two years as the race to develop AI infrastructure continues to gather pace.The Greenland data center project will cost billions of dollars to complete and has binding commitments with investors to finance half of its initial phase of development and half of the final phase, Drew Horn, a senior aide to Trump's first-term vice president Mike Pence and CEO of GreenMet, a company that's offering strategic support to the project, told CNBC. The venture is eyeing a buildout in the Kangerlussuaq area, a small settlement at the end of a deep fjord on the southwest coast of the Arctic island, with an airport, he added.Technical partners have been enlisted to help with the physical buildout, but the project has yet to secure land or approvals from the local authorities, Horn said. He declined to share the names of the other companies involved in the venture because the information isn't public yet.Commercial opportunities in Greenland have been thrust into the spotlight in recent weeks as the Arctic island has become the center of a geopolitical firestorm after U.S. President Donald Trump doubled down on acquisition talk. Critical minerals mining and freshwater reserves have been touted as potential prospects, though skeptics point to logistical challenges around tapping into them with Greenland's limited infrastructure.  watch nowMulti-billion-dollar data centerData center deals hit a record $61 billion in 2025 amid a rush to build out the infrastructure needed to power energy-intensive AI workloads. Big tech firms, including Meta, OpenAI, Oracle, AWS, Microsoft and Google are investing huge sums into developing facilities across the globe. Work on plans for the Greenland data center project began a year ago, and Horn told CNBC it has secured technical partners to assist with construction, operation and supplying energy.Committed financing, which is in the form of debt and equity, is contingent on the project meeting key milestones, including securing permits from local government, said Horn — who was also a senior advisor to both the energy and intelligence departments towards the end of Trump's first term.Other former senior Trump employees also have stakes in GreenMet, which says on its website that it helps companies with government and private funding and strategic partnerships.  George Sorial, who was an executive vice president and chief compliance counsel at the Trump Organization until 2019, and Keith Schiller, who was a longtime bodyguard for Trump and director of Oval Office operations during the U.S. president's first term, helped set up the company in 2021 and remain shareholders.\"We are not actively involved with GreenMet or Greenland,\" Sorial told CNBC. \"We are passive minority shareholders in GreenMet and have no management role in the company.\" Schiller had not responded to a CNBC request for comment as this story went live.The GreenMet CEO has been developing relationships with officials in the Greenlandic and Danish administrations as he looks to advance the project. He met the Danish Ambassador to the U.S. Jesper Møller Sørensen on Wednesday, as part of a \"continuing dialogue,\" to discuss the data center, Horn said. CNBC has approached Denmark's U.S. embassy for comment.While officials on all sides have been supportive of the project, the \"issue is not so much on the private side, it's on the diplomatic,\" Horn said, pointing to the geopolitical tensions surrounding the U.S. push to acquire Greenland, a semi-autonomous Danish territory.Tensions have cooled since Trump backtracked on plans to impose tariffs on several European nations over the issue, but questions still remain as negotiations around U.S. military and economic involvement in Greenland continue.\"Our effort, which is purely private, it succeeds only if we have the buy-in from the relevant affected parties and countries,\" Horn said.Securing power\"Larger corporate entities\" will be taking the lead on the construction and development of the data center, but GreenMet will continue to be involved as an advisor as the project looks to secure government investment from nations including the U.S., Greenland, Denmark, and other NATO countries, Horn told CNBC. \"We've spent about a year putting together everything from the power to the technology components, [and] we have a Greenlandic partner on the ground,\" Horn said. \"Right now we're waiting on approvals from the Greenlandic side.\"A big challenge for projects of this scale in Greenland is access to power. For the first phase of the project, which is targeting 300 MW power capacity, the plan is to use specialized barges carrying Liquefied Natural Gas to the fjord, Horn said.The venture plans to build a hydroelectric facility — 70% of the island's energy comes from such facilities — to power the second phase, which would see the data center hit 1.5 GW capacity. Permits and approvals from the Greenlandic government are still pending for both the barges and the facility. Greenland's Ministry of Business has been approached for comment.Kangerlussuaq Fjord. Large iceberg in scenic fjord surrounded by snow-capped mountains, Southeast coast, Greenland.Vw Pics | Universal Images Group | Getty ImagesHorn argues that if local authorities greenlight the large hydroelectric facility, energy prices will make the project commercially viable long-term. There are some significant advantages to building data centers in an environment with low temperatures, analysts told CNBC.\"The biggest value sits in its resource profile, specifically in hydro for electricity generation and a 'free cooling' proposition given the lower ambient temperature,\" Noah Ramos, strategist at investment research firm Alpine Macro, told CNBC.But there are hurdles the project will have to overcome. \"Building in the Arctic is capital intensive; construction seasons are short, and the heat from the servers can melt the very ground the building sits on... specialized engineering is needed,\" Ramos said.Nvidia is also touting a new generation of chips that require less cooling. \"It's early days, but if future generations of chips are even more efficient in this regard, it could negate the need for expensive data centre build outs in places like Greenland,\" Michael Field, chief equity strategist at Morningstar, told CNBC.watch now",

    "body": "Benito Aguilar | Twenty20Jason Gewirtz is vice president of news at CNBC.  What follows is a personal account of his experience with a scammer.Last week my cell phone rang. It was about 1:30 p.m., and the iPhone ID showed the 650 area code, which I recognized as the San Francisco Bay Area. The caller ID listed the number as unknown but labeled it as coming from San Francisco.Given San Francisco's position in the heart of global innovation and technology and that it's the location of one of CNBC's key bureaus, I picked up despite not knowing who was calling, something people rarely do anymore.The voice on the other end introduced himself as Brian Miller from Coinbase's security office. He quickly told me there was \"suspicious activity\" on my account and wanted to know if I was trying to log in from Frankfurt, Germany, on an iPhone. I told him, \"No, I haven't been in Germany in 20 years, and I never use my cell phone to log into my Coinbase account.\"  He told me someone with an address of \"Mohamad25@gmail.com\" was in my Coinbase account and had tried to make a transfer. The man claiming to be Miller then said, \"I haven't seen this one before. He's saying he lost his phone on a conveyor belt at the airport in Frankfurt and needs access.\" Miller stopped for a second and then said, \"He's trying to make another transfer right now.\"He continued, \"I'm trying to figure out how he got access, he has your Social Security number, your phone and your email address. He also gave us a photo that matches your Coinbase face scan. Have you given anyone access to your information lately or have you noticed anything else suspicious on other accounts?\" \"No,\" I said.Looking back it's pretty clear, even to me, the attempted scam used classic pressure tactics to get me to feel like I was in danger, so I'd make a fast decision, rather than a smart one.\"They try to make you scared by making you feel like you're the victim, and they're calling to help,\" said Rick Wash, professor of information science at the University of Wisconsin, in a phone interview. Wash is a computer scientist who researched the possibility of electronic breaches two decades ago. He then began mixing his vast technical knowledge to focus on the personal side of the scam. \"I began to realize the human factor was often the most critical factor of computer scams,\" Wash said.watch nowWhile something always seemed out of place, my suspicions grew when Miller mentioned my photo. \"I never gave Coinbase my photo,\" I told him.  He said, \"In order to get an account you would have had to. You might not remember doing it but we have to have it due to know-your-customer rules.\" Miller then told me, \"He's trying to make another transfer, but I have it on hold so he can't.\"I asked him to please send me an email so I know that he's really calling from Coinbase. He said, \"I just sent you a case number about 10 seconds ago, you should have it.\" Then he asked if I had something to write with, and he read me a six-digit number. I told him that the email didn't arrive.  \"Let me send another one,\" he said. \"This will have a new case number.\" He read a second number and then said, \"I'll wait until you get the email. You might not get it in your inbox because he's trying to change your email address. Check your spam.\"  Both messages were in the spam folder from what appeared to be a Coinbase email.  The messages had the same confirmation codes as the ones he gave me on the phone. There were no typos, there was a Coinbase logo and a text box with all the key information. The email address appeared to have come from Coinbase, but I thought it was odd it didn't have Miller's name on it. Then I spotted another sign that something wasn't right: The two emails came from slightly different addresses. One said \"no-reply@mail-coinbase.com via sportuel.com,\" and the other said \"support@info.coinbase via live-coinbase.com.\"He asked, \"When was your last Coinbase transaction?\" I thought for a few seconds and then remembered buying a very small amount of \"Monad\" which I'd never heard of before a guest mentioned it on \"Squawk Box\" last month. Read more CNBC reporting on AIThis Meta alum has spent 10 months leading OpenAI's nationwide hunt for its Stargate data centersAI Sam Altman and the Sora copyright gamble: 'I hope Nintendo doesn't sue us'Anthropic launches Claude Sonnet 4.5, its latest AI model that's 'more of a colleague'Sam Altman on worries about OpenAI’s $850 billion in planned buildouts: ‘I totally get that’When he followed by asking, \"What are your total assets?\" I responded, \"Shouldn't you know that?\" He said, \"Due to confidentiality, I can't say.\" So, I gave him a wide range, being embarrassed about how little money I had, and starting to realize that something wasn't right.Miller then told me I really needed a \"Coinbase Hard Wallet\" and asked if I was familiar with that. I said I was not. He offered to help me set it up.  I asked, \"First should I change my Gmail password?\" \"Probably a good idea,\" he said.Then I asked, \"Shouldn't I change my Coinbase password?\"At that point, he hesitated and said, \"We don't recommend that. Right now I have your account on hold. If you change your password, it will freeze it for up to two weeks.\"  I told Miller that I had a meeting in five minutes and asked how long it would take to get the Coinbase Hard Wallet. He told me 20 minutes. I said I had to go, but I asked if we could talk again at 3 p.m. He promised to call me back.Close callWhen I hung up, I tried to figure out what to do next.  It didn't seem right but several details lined up.  I checked my account. Nothing seemed out of order.Then I took the email addresses he had sent. I copied them and asked Claude, Anthropic's AI chatbot, if they were legitimate. The response came back, \"This is almost certainly a PHISHING scam.\"Several red flags popped up, including that the messages were coming from the wrong domain. \"The real Coinbase sends emails from @coinbase.com, not @live-coinbase.com. That hyphenated domain is a classic phishing tactic,\" according to the AI program's notes. Claude also flagged the suspicious \"via\" address: \"Legitimate companies don't route emails through third-party domains like this,\" according to the AI program.I said to myself, \"Thanks, Claude,\" while also thinking, \"That was close.\" I called an old contact in Coinbase's public relations department who told me, \"I don't work there anymore, but that's probably a scam. Coinbase doesn't call people.\"  She promised to send details on my situation to the current team at Coinbase who texted and called within a few minutes confirming it was a scam. The caller ID lit up on phone, \"Coinbase\" and because I expected the call, I was willing to trust it despite being a little nervous at first. I told the Coinbase representative I'd write up the whole 15-minute call for her so they could hopefully use it to warn others… then decided, maybe this would be a good article for CNBC.com.  Coinbase agreed. A spokesperson who often deals with security issues said the company has ways to prevent people from being scammed, even when the victim falls for it, including watching for large transfers or sudden sales from accounts that don't often transfer or sell crypto. A smartphone with the Coinbase logo and representation of cryptocurrencies are placed on a keyboard in this photo taken June 8, 2023.Dado Ruvic | Reuters\"We invest heavily in prevention, detection, and rapid response,\" the spokesperson said in an email. The rep added that Coinbase would never tell a customer to transfer crypto into a safe wallet. \"If someone tells you to move funds to protect them, it's a scam,\" the spokesperson said.Coinbase also acknowledged that artificial intelligence was a multiplying factor in scam attempts and the quality of scams. \"Attackers use a variety of bots and AI automations to make their workflows easier\" the company said, noting that AI voice agents are being used \"to create more believable automated calls.\"According to ZeroShadow, a firm that tries to return stolen crypto assets back to their rightful owners, their systems have seen a 1,400% increase in \"impersonation scams\" in the last year. \"The attacks come from inside and outside of the U.S., but the people behind the scams often try to hire young men or teenagers, people who have less inhibition, and train them,\" said Casey G., ZeroShadow's CEO, who asked that his full last name be withheld because of security threats. \"They sell them scripts and sometimes voice modulation devices.\"The CEO said his firm has recovered about $200 million for victims over the last four years, but he admits it's a difficult process. \"Once the crypto is out of your account, we can trace it, but getting it back isn't so easy,\" he said. \"We need help from local authorities. Crypto has less protection than the traditional banking system in the U.S.\" Casey G. also said AI is being used by scam chiefs to multiply their workforce.One of the most successful techniques the scammer used was creating a sense of urgency. By telling me there was an ongoing attempt while we were on the phone, I was almost tricked into taking action or giving up information. I felt my pulse racing and had an instinct to stop whatever was happening.  Anti-scam experts say that's a common tactic that's getting more sophisticated as bad actors buy and sell successful \"scam scripts\" on the dark web. Coinbase said it advises people to \"slow down, take a beat, verify things independently and don't act under pressure.\"Be careful out there.WATCH: The alarming rise of AI 'nudify' appswatch now",

    "body": "Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg tries on Orion AR glasses at the Meta Connect annual event at the company's headquarters in Menlo Park, California, U.S., September 25, 2024. REUTERS/Manuel OrbegozoManuel Orbegozo | ReutersMeta's deprioritizing virtual reality in favor of artificial intelligence and Internet-connected smart glasses has chilled the industry, leading to concerns about its future. \"I can see how it feels like a VR winter,\" said Jessica Young, an independent VR content creator specializing in Horizon Worlds, Meta's virtual social network. The social media giant last week laid off 10% of employees who work within its Reality Labs unit, with the cuts centering on VR-related initiatives like the Quest VR headsets, CNBC reported. Teams working on  Horizon Worlds were hit hard and some in-house studios were shuttered. Approximately 1,000 jobs were cut, CNBC reported. The move was part of the company's effort to redirect Reality Labs investments from VR to AI and wearable devices like the Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses that are co-produced with EssilorLuxottica, a spokesperson for the social media company said in a statement last week. Meta declined to comment further beyond its previous statement.Meta's reduced investment in VR is notable considering how much the company has helped grow the industry since its $2 billion acquisition of Oculus in 2014. The company became synonymous with VR when CEO Mark Zuckerberg changed its name from Facebook to Meta, representing the founder's obsession with a future of digital worlds referred to as the metaverse. Since late 2020, Meta's Reality Labs division has logged over $70 billion in cumulative losses.Zuckerberg's sudden reversal has some VR developers worried about their future prospects. While they said they don't see Meta killing its VR efforts, a major shift appears to be underway.

Instead, Meta introduced its $799 Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses that contain a single, built-in digital screen. \"If Meta's not putting out a new headset for another year or two, it's going to feel stale,\" Young said. \"It already kind of does.\"Since the layoffs, Meta tech chief Andrew Bosworth has been vocal that the social media giant is not abandoning VR.\"We're still continuing to invest heavily in this space, but obviously, VR is growing less quickly than we hoped,\" Bosworth told tech newsletter Sources. \"And so you want to make sure that your investment is right-sized.\"Bosworth this week also circulated a post by Oculus co-founder Palmer Luckey, who on Sunday wrote on X that Meta still employs the \"largest team working on VR by about an order of magnitude.\" Although Luckey said that he feels \"really bad for the people impacted\" by the layoffs, the Reality Labs changes represent \"a good thing thing for the long-term health of the industry, especially the ongoing incentives.\"'The market has spoken'Market research firm IDC said in a December report that a major transition is occurring in the so-called Extended Reality, or XR, device segment. This category includes VR and so-called mixed-reality headsets that allow users to switch between virtual environments and see their surroundings outside the helmet. The category also counts AI-powered smart glasses and more powerful versions with digital displays.IDC projects the XR device category to have grown 41.6% year-over-year to 14.5 million units shipped for 2025. But that growth has nothing to do with VR and mixed-reality headsets — those shipments are expected to drop 42.8% to 3.9 million in 2025. The rest of this XR category, which includes AI glasses with and without displays, is projected to grow 211.2% year-over-year to 10.6 million units shipped for 2025.Jitesh Ubrani, a research manager for market analyst firm IDC, characterized the VR headset market as niche and appealing to only a small segment of video gamers. Average consumers seem uninterested in wearing \"big, bulky headsets\" for lengthy VR sessions like much of the tech industry hoped for roughly a decade ago, he said.\"The market has spoken,\" Ubrani said. \"There are certain niche audiences that will continue to use these headsets, but it's not going to be broadly appealing.\"Visitors experience the new AR+AI glasses flagship product at the XREAL booth at WAIC 2025 in Shanghai, China, on July 27, 2025. Costfoto | Nurphoto | Getty ImagesAndrew Eiche, the CEO of the Google-owned VR gaming studio Owlchemy Labs, said it was always misguided to think VR was on the cusp of having its breakthrough smartphone moment. He called it a \"strategic mistake\" to compare VR headsets to iPhones The VR market, Eiche said, more closely resembles old-school Atari video game consoles that were popular before sales crashed during an infamous 1983 gaming market meltdown. It wasn't until the late 1980s that Nintendo consoles helped revive the market, laying the groundwork for the overall industry to balloon to the massive sector it is today.\"Lot of tech people thought [VR] was going to be instantly amazing, and the same thing's happening with AI,\" Eiche said about the tech industry's pivot to the latest craze. \"When you're looking at long-term technologies, VR is not going anywhere.\"Still, Eiche said that beyond Meta's layoffs, other VR studios have also recently downsized as part of a broader video game industry slump. Because Quest is the dominant VR headset on the market, its app store is a key distribution channel for third-party VR.Making matters worse, Eiche said that Meta's Horizon Worlds push came at the expense of third-party developers who were trying to find visibility among Quest users.\"We're at the mercy of Meta,\" Eiche said, adding that it \"creates a situation where if Meta pulls back, we all pull back.\" Eiche said he's optimistic that the upcoming Steam Frame wireless VR headset from gaming company Valve will help the market, as well as the recent entries of other devices like the Samsung Galaxy XR, which debuted in October, and Apple's Vision Pro. But Apple's entry into the VR space in February 2024 hasn't done much to move the needle, and in January, IDC said that Apple's Chinese manufacturing partner Luxshare stopped producing new Vision Pro headsets, signaling a lack of widespread consumer demand. Still, Ubrani said that Apple's $3,499 spatial computing headset has found some footing as a business tool.\"Apple did do well in selling to a lot of developers, but they also sold into some very big companies,\" Ubrani said.watch nowVR's hope shifts to the enterprise market\"There were certain quarters where Apple beat Meta in enterprise,\" Ubrani said, due in part to the iPhone-maker's experience selling devices to businesses. The enterprise VR market may not be as glamorous as its consumer counterpart, but it represents an area where IDC has \"seen slow but upwards movement, because companies are realizing that there is great ROI attached with deploying these headsets.\"As part of Meta's Reality Labs cuts, the company said in a support page that it would end its Horizon managed services program that was for businesses that used Quest headsets for internal tasks like virtual employee trainings.Meta failed to realize \"how big VR could be if they adopted the bigger picture outside of gaming,\" said Sean Mann, CEO of the startup RP1, which develops a \"metaverse browser\" for people to access virtual and augmented reality environments. As Meta downsizes its VR ambitions and steers Horizon Worlds to be a mobile-focused online gaming platform like Roblox, Young said she plans to keep creating experiences on the platform. Young has been able to make a living by getting paid by other Horizon developers to create trailers to promote experiences available to users on the service. She's also earned money from Meta by winning Horizon-related competitions intended to help improve the overall platform.But Young said she's less enthusiastic about Horizon's mobile push, because there was something special about the platform during its earlier, VR-centric years, particularly during the Covid era. \"Horizon became a lifeline for people isolated by the pandemic, disability, age or geography,\" she said. \"Many users who never imagined themselves as creators, who had no background in art or programming, were inspired by their friends to try.\"But Horizon lost is way, and \"what's frustrating now is watching people declare it dead without ever having experienced or understanding what it was,\" Young said.

California, Colorado, Connecticut, Maryland, Massachusetts and New Mexico have all started offering additional state-funded premium subsidies in 2026 in order to help keep insurance premiums from becoming unaffordable for many residents after enhanced federal subsidies expired at the end of 2025, experts said. In most cases, the state assistance is less generous than the lapsed federal aid, they said.But state subsidies will help many consumers — especially those with lower incomes — and reduce the number of households that drop their insurance coverage, experts said.\"They soften the blow,\" Louise Norris, a health policy analyst for insurance referral site healthinsurance.org, said of the state-level premium subsidies.Roughly 2.6 million people in California, Colorado, Connecticut, Maryland, Massachusetts and New Mexico received enhanced federal premium subsidies in 2025 — about 12% of all consumers getting them nationwide, according to federal data tracked by KFF, a nonpartisan health policy research group.Blue states offer ACA subsidiesA sign on an insurance store advertises Obamacare in San Diego, California, Oct. 26, 2017.Mike Blake | ReutersThe maneuvers may deepen the political divide on the issue of health insurance subsidies, experts said.Democrats on Capitol Hill have pushed to extend the expired federal subsidies, even centering the record-long government shutdown around the issue. The Republican majority has thus far stymied their efforts.Blue states are the ones that have chosen to offer extra premium assistance to residents, said Matt McGough, an Affordable Care Act policy analyst at KFF. Even then, it's only a \"very small handful\" that have done so, he said. Red states like Texas and Florida saw by far the largest growth in ACA enrollment after enhanced federal subsidies took effect in 2021, and they stand to see many of those consumers drop their insurance coverage now that the federal subsidies have ended, McGough said.Read more CNBC personal finance coverageTherapists see more workers anxious about AI: It's 'a fear of becoming obsolete'Major winter storm may affect over 170 million Americans — how much it could cost youAs federal ACA subsidies lapse, blue states offer their ownIn an affordability crunch, Gen Z adults lean on their parents for financial helpHow a smaller IRS, budget cuts may impact tax filing: 'Buckle your seatbelts,' expert says'Will Social Security run out?' is the wrong question, economist says.

The two states' enrollees account for more than a third of the roughly 22 million Americans who received premium subsidies that year. By comparison, in California, the most populous state in the U.S., 1.8 million people received premium tax credits last year. The partisan disparity on ACA subsidies comes in a midterm election year in which Republicans are trying to hold onto a razor-thin majority in the House of Representatives, and as affordability has emerged as a key focus for politicians and consumers.Financial impact of ACA enhanced subsidy lapseThe average person who received a premium tax credit last year is expected to see their insurance premiums more than double in 2026, to $1,904 per month from $888, due to the expiration of the enhanced federal subsidies, according to KFF.The enhanced subsidies started in 2021. They built on the original framework of premium tax credits that had been available since 2014, in the early days of the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. That original tranche of federal subsidies remains. They work on a sliding scale, with more assistance available to lower-income households. watch nowHowever, they aren't as valuable as the enhanced premium tax credits. The enhanced subsidies had capped out-of-pocket payments for households at 8.5% of their annual income; now, that cap has increased to about 10%.Additionally, certain households no longer qualify to receive a premium tax credit because of the return of the so-called subsidy cliff.Specifically, enhanced subsidies allowed middle-income households that earn more than 400% of the federal poverty level — about $63,000 for a single individual or about $129,000 for a family of four — to qualify for a premium tax credit for the first time. Now, they're once again ineligible. The federal government uses the 2025 poverty guidelines to determine income eligibility for 2026. What states are doing to plug the gapThe healthcare.gov website on a laptop arranged in Norfolk, Virginia, Nov. 1, 2025.Stefani Reynolds | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesBefore the federal enhanced subsidies lapsed, states like Washington, New York, Connecticut, Vermont, Massachusetts and New Jersey had already offered additional state assistance — on top of federal premium tax credits — to help make health insurance more affordable, according to McGough.Those remain in place, he said.Other states have taken measures to shore up financial assistance, due specifically to the expiration of enhanced federal subsidies. New MexicoNew Mexico is the only state that has fully replaced the enhanced federal subsidies for residents, experts said. \"They backfilled everything,\" Norris said. \"Nobody lost out on their subsidies in New Mexico. As a result, enrollment really grew.\"ACA enrollment has grown by about 17% year over year in 2026, according to state-level data, a dynamic that Norris said bucks the national trend. Federal data suggests that about 1.5 million U.S. households had already dropped their insurance coverage by early January. The Urban Institute estimates nearly 5 million people will ultimately drop their health coverage in 2026 and be uninsured due to lapsing subsidies.New Mexico state lawmakers are offering the funding through June 30. Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham, a Democrat, has called for an extension beyond June 30 if Congress doesn't legislate additional funding. ConnecticutConnecticut is the only other state that has moved to replace at least some of the expiring subsidies for those with incomes over 400% of the federal poverty line, the group of consumers who fell off the federal subsidy cliff, Norris said. Connecticut will replace half of the lapsed subsidy amounts for those with income between 400% and 500% of the federal poverty level, according to Access Health CT, the state health insurance marketplace. That equates to about $63,000 to $78,000 for a single person, for example.watch nowConnecticut will also fully fund the expired enhanced subsidy amounts for households with incomes between 100% and 200% of the federal poverty level, or $15,650 to about $31,000.The state is targeting consumers \"particularly hard hit\" by expiring subsidies, Norris said. For example, the average household with an income over 400% of the federal poverty line is expected to see its annual ACA health premiums jump to about $8,500 in 2026 from $4,400, according to the Urban Institute. MassachusettsMassachusetts Gov. Maura Healey addresses the public while surrounded by Texas state legislators during a press conference at the Massachusetts State House on Aug. 5, 2025.Ben Pennington | Boston Globe | Getty ImagesMassachusetts is investing an extra $250 million into its state health insurance marketplace, called ConnectorCare, for 2026, bringing the total to $600 million, according to a Jan. 8 press release issued by Gov. Maura Healey and Lt. Gov. Kim Driscoll.The funding comes from the Commonwealth Care Trust Fund, a special revenue fund for state expenses, according to the release. The investment means about 270,000 consumers earning less than 400% of the federal poverty line \"will see little to no premium increases because of the expiring federal credits,\" according to the release. The state also capped health deductibles and co-pays for the first time, as well as the cost of insulin and inhalers, it said. Separately, Massachusetts had also previously established a pilot program offering state premium subsidies for people who earn up to 500% of the federal poverty line, according to Norris. The state extended that program for 2026. MarylandOther states have taken steps to blunt the impact largely for lower-income households, experts said. For example, Maryland's state subsidy program will fully replace the enhanced federal premium subsidies for those under 200% of federal poverty level, according to the Maryland Insurance Administration. It will also replace half of the lapsed federal subsidies for those between 250% and 400% of the federal poverty level.California Smith Collection/gado | Archive Photos | Getty ImagesCalifornia allocated $190 million to offer state subsidies in 2026 for people earning up to 150% of the federal poverty level, according to Covered California, the state's health insurance marketplace. The sum ensures \"monthly premiums remain comparable to 2025 levels\" for those with incomes of roughly $23,500 for an individual or $48,000 for a family of four, according to Covered California. They soften the blow. Louise Norrishealth policy analyst for healthinsurance.orgHowever, the $190 million offsets just a small share of the $2.5 billion that California residents are losing in 2026 due to the expiration of the federal subsidy enhancements, according to Norris.California is also offering \"some additional assistance\" to those earning up to 165% of the federal poverty level, according to the state marketplace. ColoradoColorado is offering a maximum $80 per month in 2026 for an individual enrollee, and another $29 for each subsequent family member that pays a premium, according to McGough.The premium subsidy is available to households making between 100% to 400% of the federal poverty level.The plan will backfill about 40% of the lost federal assistance, McGough said.",

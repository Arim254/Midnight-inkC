    "body": "Jamie Dimon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of JPMorgan Chase & Co., attends the ribbon-cutting ceremony opening the firm’s new headquarters at 270 Park Avenue, in New York City, U.S., October 21, 2025.   Eduardo Munoz | ReutersJPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon said the bank is taking steps to address the impact of artificial intelligence on its workers, part of what he said should be a broader societal response to the potentially disruptive nature of AI.Dimon described at an investor meeting late Monday his bank's internal plans to shift employees into new roles as automation accelerates.\"We already have huge redeployment plans for own people,\" Dimon said. \"In fact, we spoke about it today, and we have to up that a little bit so we can take people who are displaced — and we have displaced people from AI — and we offer them other jobs.\"JPMorgan, the world's biggest bank by market cap, has the industry's largest annual tech budget at nearly $20 billion. Its executives have outlined an ambitious agenda to become \"fundamentally rewired\" for the AI era.Even at this early stage, the bank's workforce provides a snapshot of what happens when corporations employ AI technology, including models from OpenAI and Anthropic, which are both used by JPMorgan's AI portal.The bank's headcount was roughly unchanged at 318,512 over the past year, but there were changes below the surface: Operations and support staff fell by 4% and 2%, respectively, as the firm added 4% to roles that involve catering to clients and generating revenue.It did that by using technology to boost the number of accounts that each operations employee can handle (up 6%), reducing the per-unit cost to deal with fraud (down 11%) and making their software engineers 10% more efficient, according to the bank's presentation.  JPMorgan has doubled the use cases for generative AI this year, focusing on customer service and the firm's technology workers, Chief Financial Officer Jeremy Barnum said at the investor meeting.A JPMorgan spokeswoman declined to elaborate on Dimon's comments about plans for redeployment. Disruption risk When an analyst on Monday asked if Dimon was concerned about the risk of widespread unemployment because of AI — one of several fears circulating as every AI model update seems to wallop the shares of public companies in recent weeks — Dimon had this response: \"We are going to deploy AI as best we can to do a better job for our customers,\" he said. The CEO  has previously likened the potential impact of AI to that of electricity or the printing press.Beyond the \"huge redeployment plans\" for his bank, Dimon expressed concern that the rapid adoption of AI could put entire professions out of work.As a thought experiment, what if autonomous trucks were introduced overnight, he asked.\"Would you do it if you put 2 million people on the street?\" Dimon asked. \"That next job is $25,000 a year, stocking shelves.\"Businesses and governments need to begin planning for this risk now, with ideas including assistance and training for displaced workers, he said.\"Society's got to think through what it wants to do if this becomes that kind of problem,\" Dimon said. \"Now is the time to start thinking about it.\"watch now",

Robert Garcia said on Tuesday.Garcia's statement comes after reports that FBI interviews with that accuser were not viewable on the DOJ's database of millions of files related to Epstein that were made public after a federal law was passed by Congress mandating their disclosure.\"For the last few weeks, Oversight Democrats have been investigating the FBI's handling of allegations from 2019 of sexual assault on a minor made against President Donald Trump by a survivor,\" Garcia, D-Calif., said in a statement.\"Yesterday, I reviewed unredacted evidence logs at the Department of Justice. Oversight Democrats can confirm that the DOJ appears to have illegally withheld FBI interviews with this survivor who accused President Trump of heinous crimes,\" said Garcia, who is the ranking Democrat on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee.\"Oversight Democrats will open a parallel investigation into this.\"Garcia also said that because of a prior subpoena issued by the Oversight Committee, as well as the Epstein Files Transparency Act, \"these records must immediately be shared with Congress and the American public.\"\"Covering up direct evidence of a potential assault by the President of the United States is the most serious possible crime in this White House cover up,\" he said.CNBC has requested comment on Garcia's statement from the DOJ and the White House.Trump is a former friend of Epstein. The two fell out in the early 2000s.The president has never been criminally charged in connection with a claim by an Epstein survivor.Trump last week said the Epstein files had \"totally exonerated\" him.Trump's comment came after he was asked by a reporter about the arrest of Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, the former British prince, by police in the United Kingdom on suspicion of misconduct in public office. That arrest is believed to be related to an investigation into whether Mountbatten-Windsor, the younger brother of King Charles III, had shared confidential trade reports with Epstein.\"I'm the expert in a way because I've been totally exonerated. That's very nice. I can actually speak about it very nicely,\" Trump said of the arrest.\"I think it's a shame. I did nothing,\" the president said.",

    "body": "Signage at the Google Midlothian Data Center in Midlothian, Texas, US, on Friday, Nov. 14, 2025.Jonathan Johnson | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesAlphabet's Google will build its first data center in Minnesota and deploy a significant amount of new renewable energy in the state under an agreement with utility Xcel, the companies announced Tuesday. The data center will be located on a 480-acre site at Pine Island, a town of about 4,000 people some 70 miles southeast of Minneapolis. Google had not publicly disclosed its role in the project previously. The facility will be used for artificial intelligence applications as well as Google's broader cloud business. The proposed data center at Pine Island has faced community opposition but is supported by the city council. It has not begun construction yet. Data centers are facing political blowback in communities across the U.S. more often as people blame them for rising electricity prices in some regions and worry about their environmental impact. Data centers also consume a significant amount of water for cooling. Google declined to disclose how much electricity the data center will consume. The tech company said it will pay for any electric grid infrastructure needed for the project. The Minnesota Public Utilities Commission still must review the agreement between Google and Xcel. \"What Google is doing is ensuring that when we show up, we aren't putting additional costs on other ratepayers,\" Amanda Peterson Corio, head of data center energy at Google, told CNBC in an interview. \"We will pay 100% of our energy and electricity costs, and we will make sure that new additional capacity is put on to the grid to be able to serve our needs.\"Additional transmission infrastructure is needed for the Pine Island data center, said Bria Shea, president of Xcel for Minnesota, North Dakota and South Dakota. Google will pay for any new transmission associated with the project even if the data center does not materialize for some reason, Corio said. Google will deploy 1,400 megawatts of wind power, 200 megawatts of solar and 300 megawatts of battery storage to the grid under the agreement with Xcel. The renewable projects will be owned by the utility. They are expected to come online in 2028 and 2029, Shea said.Google will also pay a premium for the renewable power under a tariff designed to insulate consumers from the infrastructure costs while accelerating the deployment of clean energy in Minnesota, according to the tech company. The town's residents have formed a group called \"Stop the Pine Island Data Center.\" The Minnesota Center for Environmental Advocacy filed a lawsuit in October challenging the environmental review of the project. Pine Island's city council approved two preliminary development plans for the data center in December, according to local broadcaster KTTC. It also approved financial incentives that include a $36 million tax abatement in February, according to the outlet. City Administrator Elizabeth Howard said Pine Island would collect more than $130 million in tax revenue from the project, according to KTTC.  Minnesota has not been a major data center market in the past but the big tech companies are increasingly eyeing the state. There are currently 74 data centers in Minnesota. Virginia, the largest market worldwide, has 570 such facilities, according to the Data Center Map.

Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat from Massachusetts and ranking member of Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee, speaks during a roundtable on housing affordability in Washington, Jan. 7, 2026.Al Drago | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesBoth congressional Democrats and President Donald Trump both want to limit how many homes major corporations can own, but a new proposal from Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., makes it clear that's where the agreement ends. In a bill released hours before Trump's State of the Union speech, Warren, Sen. Jeff Merkley, D-Ore., and 16 other Senate Democrats propose ending some housing-related tax benefits for major corporations. The bill would prevent companies with more than 50 single-family homes for rent from taking deductions for housing value depreciation and mortgage interest payments. Corporations would also be barred from getting federally backed mortgages. The bill would provide a temporary carve-out for companies building new multifamily housing or rehabilitating properties that would otherwise be uninhabitable. The Trump administration is pushing its own housing proposal. In a memo sent to lawmakers last week, the administration proposed banning institutional investors who own more than 100 single-family homes from buying any new ones. Trump's proposal also includes several exceptions for companies that increase the number of single-family homes.The dueling proposals come as legislation to boost housing supply and affordability is in the home stretch to becoming law. The House passed a bipartisan bill earlier this month with broad support, and the Senate advanced its own bipartisan bill last year. The two sides are working to combine the proposals into a final package. ",

So many people have been praying, of every faith and no faith at all, praying for her return, and we feel those prayers,\" Guthrie said.\"We still believe that she can come home, hope against hope, as my sister says,\" Guthrie said. \"We are blowing on the embers of hope.

    "body": "Growing up in Iowa, Steven and Ashley Evans knew all about the local fire station in Cedar Rapids because it was right by the high school they both attended. \"We always dreamed we'd live here one day. It went up for sale and we thought we'd come check it out,\" Steven, 40, tells CNBC Make It. \"When we tell people we live in an old firehouse, everyone around here knows exactly where it is and which one it is.\"The station was first built in 1960 and converted into a home by its previous owners in the 1980s. In 2016, when the Evans first saw it was for sale, listed for $125,000, it had been abandoned for years and was covered in black mold.\"We had no intentions of purchasing it because we didn't have the finances at the time,\" Ashley, 33, says. In 2016, she was working as a dermatology nurse, and Steven had a job working with adults with special needs and owned six rental properties. They owned a house they paid $65,000 for, Ashley says, but \"my parents actually had to cosign on the house because we just couldn't afford it. ... It was $550 a month, and we were just struggling.\"Ashley and Steven Evans bought the fire station in 2016.Ashley and Steven EvansStill, they decided to take a look at the firehouse. Even when they had to sign waivers to enter because it was deemed a safety hazard due to the mold, they weren't deterred. \"The thing that attracted me the most to the fire station would be the fact that it's all concrete and steel. The bones were solid, the house was level; any other house would have fallen over easily by now,\" Steven says. Without letting Ashley know, Steven put in an offer of $90,000 and it was accepted. He came clean the next day — he says he wanted it to be a surprise to Ashley that he bought the fire station they used to always see by their high school. Getting the fire station up to codeThe property was listed as a four-bedroom, two-bathroom house with 3,100 square feet of space, but it turned out to be almost double that size since the listing only included the finished square footage, not the unfinished square footage, Steven says.In order to finance the purchase, Steven applied for a construction loan of $170,000 under his rental property business, according to documents reviewed by CNBC Make It. The couple says they did it that way because their original plan was to renovate the fire station and resell it. Steven says that because of all the work the property needed, they didn't think they would ever be able to live in it. When the couple closed on the property in June 2016, it lacked walls, electricity or even a working toilet. Before the couple bought the fire station it had been abandoned for years.Ashley and Steven EvansWith an estimated budget of $80,000, the Evans started on the renovation, with Steven doing most of the work himself to save money. They rented out the house their parents cosigned with them and moved into the fire station while they renovated. Ashley's parents even moved in with them to help pay the renovation-related bills. Here are some of the biggest expenses the couple encountered while renovating. All amounts are rounded. Paint: $1,100Drywall: $4,000Flooring: $5,000Kitchen addition: $10,000Roof: $22,000 \"Whatever we could find on clearance, whatever people wanted to give us, that is how we would remodel it. Just trying to make it look the best we can on the cheapest budget,\" Ashley says. \"If it didn't match, we'd spray paint it to match,\" Steven adds. Steven says he loved the fire station because the foundation was solid.Fred Ebong for CNBC Make ItAlthough the couple had to essentially remodel everything, they kept some original details from the fire station, including the old hose tower, the garage doors and a historic plaque outside. They kept the massive skylight the previous owners had installed to cover a courtyard that was originally part of the fire station as well.To pay homage to the station's history, the couple also bought an old fire truck to put in their backyard for their kids to play with. The couple decided to convert part of the fire station into an indoor soccer field.Fred Ebong for CNBC Make ItThe couple made the space their own by adding a theater room and a playroom for their kids that looks like a soccer field with fake turf. \"We had friends who had an indoor soccer field [growing up]. I always thought it was the coolest thing ever. I remembered it even as an adult, so I decided to create one down here,\" Steven says. Spreading roots around the fire stationIn 2019, Steven and Ashley refinanced their original loan into a mortgage to officially purchase the home in their names. They secured a 5.5-year balloon mortgage for $225,000 at a 4.89% interest rate, with an estimated monthly payment of $1,455, according to documents reviewed by CNBC Make It. When the term ended in 2024, the couple refinanced into a new mortgage; now their monthly payment is around $3,190 and their interest rate is 7.59%. The couple also remodeled their kitchen recently, which they financed with a home equity line of credit.Here the monthly expenses related to the house:  Electricity: $17.49Internet: $186.85HELOC for kitchen renovation: $423.65Utilities: $475.99Gas: $426.93Solar panels: $553.98 Mortgage: $3,190.05Since the couple started sharing what life is like in the fire station on social media years ago, viewers always ask if they will ever leave or sell the property, they say. But the couple says even if they ever move, they will never sell the fire station. Instead, in 2020, Steven and Ashley bought the house next door for $180,000, according to documents reviewed by CNBC Make It. Ashley's parents have taken ownership of the property, she says. The couple converted a room into a home theater.Fred Ebong for CNBC Make ItLast year, Ashley and Steven also bought another house near the fire station for $175,000. They call it their \"cozy cottage\" and have it listed on Airbnb for $160 to $189 a night. It is fully booked through March.\"We talk about what it would be like to live in a house that was already finished all the time ...

    "body": "An aerial view of the Paramount logo on the water tower at Paramount Studios on Feb. 23, 2026 in Los Angeles, California. Justin Sullivan | Getty ImagesWarner Bros. Discovery on Tuesday said it had received a higher takeover offer from Paramount Skydance and will review the new bid under the terms of its existing deal with Netflix. Last week, WBD announced it would reengage Paramount in deal talks under a seven-day waiver from Netflix. WBD and Netflix have an agreement to sell the legacy media group's studio and streaming businesses to the streamer. Paramount is seeking to buy the entirety of WBD. \"Following engagement with PSKY during the seven-day limited waiver period, we received a revised PSKY proposal to acquire WBD, which we are reviewing in consultation with our financial and legal advisors,\" WBD said in a statement. \"We will update our shareholders following the Board's review. The Netflix merger agreement remains in effect, and the Board continues to recommend in favor of the Netflix transaction. WBD shareholders are advised not to take any action at this time with respect to the amended PSKY tender offer.\"Paramount in a statement confirmed it had submitted a revised bid and said it will continue with its previously announced tender offer while the WBD board reviews both deals. If WBD deems the new Paramount offer superior, Netflix will have four days to improve its previously agreed-upon bid. Netflix agreed to acquire WBD's studio and streaming assets for $27.75 per share in December, valuing the assets around $72 billion, with a total enterprise value of approximately $82.7 billion. Paramount subsequently launched a hostile tender offer to WBD shareholders for $30 per share for all of WBD, which includes linear cable networks such as CNN, TBS, HGTV and TNT and digital assets including Bleacher Report and House of Highlights.If WBD concludes Paramount's new offer is superior and Netflix doesn't alter its bid, Netflix will receive a $2.8 billion breakup fee. Paramount has agreed to fund that fee as part of a previously altered hostile bid.A combined Paramount-WBD would bring together HBO Max with Paramount+ along with merging two of the five largest movie studios by revenue — Warner Bros. and Paramount Skydance Studios. It would also put CNN and CBS News under one ownership structure.  Both the Netflix-WBD deal and a potential Paramount-WBD merger would need U.S. and European regulatory approval for completion, and both deals have raised antitrust concerns among critics. watch now",

Win Mcnamee | Getty ImagesApple said it's moving production of some of its Mac Mini computers to the U.S. later this year as the company seeks to bolster domestic manufacturing. The iPhone maker last year unveiled plans to invest $600 billion in the U.S., with CEO Tim Cook appearing at the White House with President Donald Trump in August for the announcement of a $100 billion outlay. The company also has said it will purchase parts and expand its relationship with U.S. suppliers. \"As part of our $600B commitment, Mac mini will be produced in the US for the first time later this year!\" Cook wrote in a post on X on Tuesday. \"We're accelerating our progress even further — producing more AI servers and opening an all-new Apple Advanced Manufacturing Center for hands-on training.\"The Mac Mini is Apple's compact, more affordable desktop computer, which start at about $600, according to the company's website. Later this year, production will begin at a new factory in Houston, where Apple started producing AI servers last year, the company said in a statement.  \"We began shipping advanced AI servers from Houston ahead of schedule, and we're excited to accelerate that work even further,\" Cook said in the release.Apple has been hit hard by tariffs imposed by the Trump administration, paying about $3.3 billion since the president initiated the levies last year. Apple is sourcing half of its iPhones for the U.S. from India and most of its other U.S.-bound products like Macs, AirPods and watches from Vietnam. The Supreme Court on Friday struck down a large chunk of President Trump's far-reaching tariff agenda, but uncertainty remains after Trump rebuked the decision. Apple said its 20,000-square-foot advanced manufacturing center in Houston will open its doors later this year. The company said it will provide training in advanced manufacturing techniques to students, supplier employees, and American businesses, teaching them \"the same innovative processes that are used to make Apple products.\"WATCH: How the Supreme Court's tariff ruling could shift Apple's supply chainwatch now",

    "body": "watch nowHome Depot on Tuesday posted a roughly 4% quarterly sales decline, as a sluggish real estate market and selective spending by homeowners continued to weigh on home improvement demand.The company also stuck by the current fiscal year forecast that it shared in December at an investor day. It said it expects full-year total sales growth to range between about 2.5% and 4.5% and adjusted earnings per share to be between roughly flat and up 4% from $14.69 in the prior fiscal year. It expects full-year comparable sales growth, which takes out one-time factors like store openings and closures, to range from flat to up 2%.Despite the fiscal fourth-quarter sales decline, Home Depot topped Wall Street's revenue and earnings expectations for that period.In an interview with CNBC, Chief Financial Officer Richard McPhail said U.S. consumers and the company have \"been in a frozen housing environment for three years\" – and there hasn't been a meaningful thaw. \"What we've seen as an added pressure during the last year has been this increase in consumer uncertainty, a gradual decline in consumer confidence,\" he said. \"And so those are signs we're watching.\"He said customers have told the company that they are concerned about housing affordability and job losses, dynamics that colored Home Depot's outlook for the year.Here's what Home Depot reported for the fiscal fourth quarter of 2025 compared with Wall Street's estimates, according to a survey of analysts by LSEG:Earnings per share: $2.72 adjusted vs. $2.54 expectedRevenue: $38.20 billion vs.  $38.12 billion expectedThe company's shares rose more than 3% on Tuesday, as Home Depot beat earnings expectations after missing estimates three quarters in a row. Higher interest rates, lower housing turnover and economic uncertainty have challenged the company, as homeowners delay the pricier projects typically spurred by buying or selling a home. In the three-month period that ended Feb. 1, Home Depot's net income fell to $2.57 billion, or $2.58 per share, from $3.0 billion, or $3.02 per share, in the year-ago period. Excluding accounting-related expenses related to the value of SRS Distribution and its subsidiaries, Home Depot posted adjusted earnings per share of $2.72.Revenue dropped from $39.70 billion in the year-ago period. The company said some decline was due to the most recent fiscal year 2025 having one fewer week. The additional week in the 2024 fiscal year contributed $2.5 billion in sales. As the Atlanta-based retailer waits for business to pick up, it laid off 800 employees and announced a five-day a week return-to-office policy in late January.Yet some investors anticipate an inflection point could be coming for Home Depot, as mortgage rates moderate slightly. The average rate on a 30-year fixed mortgage fell to 5.99% on Monday, matching its lowest level since 2022, according to Mortgage News Daily. Home Depot's biggest selling season, springtime, is also ahead.McPhail said Home Depot's business was relatively stable throughout the year, including in the fourth quarter, when adjusting for storms. He said the company is gaining market share, even as the sector lags.Comparable sales, an industry metric also called same-store sales, increased 0.4% in the fiscal fourth quarter across the business and 0.3% in the U.S. Store transactions in the quarter across Home Depot's website and stores dropped by 1.6% year over year, but average ticket rose 2.4% year over year. Pricing and tariff trendsThe growth in average ticket \"primarily reflects some price increases,\" Billy Bastek, executive vice president of merchandising, said on the company's earnings call. McPhail told CNBC that Home Depot has had \"modest\" price increases, though he declined to say which items and categories now cost customers more.Half of Home Depot's 16 merchandising departments posted positive comparable sales from the year-ago period, Bastek said. Those were power, electrical, storage, indoor garden, hardware, plumbing, bath and kitchen.Big-ticket purchases, which the company defines as those over $1,000, were 1.3% higher than the year-ago period, because of customers trading up for new and innovative items and buying higher-priced products, Bastek said.Even with those pricier purchases, there are signs that some customers are value-conscious. Bastek said some customers are trading down to lower-priced countertops and appliances, though that behavior hasn't been widespread.As U.S. consumers put off selling and buying homes, CEO Ted Decker said \"there's maybe a bit more repair than replace.\"\"We're certainly bouncing along what we hope would be a bottom in things like [housing] turnover,\" he said.Higher tariffs have been one of the forces driving price hikes at retailers, including Home Depot. Companies now face a new landscape for import duties after the Supreme Court on Friday ruled that some of the Trump administration's tariffs were illegal. Soon after the ruling, President Donald Trump said at a news conference that he would pursue alternative tariffs and proposed an across-the-board global tariff that he has since set at 15%. Decker said Home Depot is \"still in the middle of our analysis\" after the Supreme Court ruling and latest proposed tariffs.\"Not all the information is out right now. Not all the language is final around what was announced,\" he said. He added that Home Depot is \"as well positioned as anyone to understand any impacts and manage through them.\" More than half of what Home Depot sells comes from the U.S., according to the company. It's diversifying its imports, so that no single country outside of the U.S. represents more than 10% of the company's purchases, McPhail said.Though do-it-yourself buyers have cut back, the company still has a more stable business segment.A growing business from home professionals, such as contractors and roofers, has boosted Home Depot's overall business. It acquired SRS Distribution, a company that sells supplies to roofing, landscaping and pool professionals, for $18.25 billion in 2024 and bought GMS, a specialty building products distributor, for about $4.3 billion last year. Pro business is strong, but still pressuredPro sales were stronger than do-it-yourself sales during the fourth quarter, McPhail told CNBC, though he declined to share specific figures. Even the pro side of the business has been pressured. McPhail said on the company's earnings call that SRS' sales declined by a low single-digit percentage in the fourth quarter compared with the year-ago period.Yet he added the company — which sells supplies to roofers and other pros — fared better than others. He referred to market research data for the industry, which showed that total shipments of shingles fell 28% year over year to the lowest industry volume since 2019. For the full fiscal year, SRS' organic sales grew by a low single-digit percentage, despite slower demand in the home improvement industry and a lack of storms, Decker said. He said Home Depot expects the company's organic sales to increase by a mid-single digit percentage in fiscal 2026.Home Depot opened 12 stores in fiscal 2025 and plans to open 15 additional stores this fiscal year.The company also announced on Tuesday that its board of directors increased its quarterly dividend by 1.3%, or 3 cents, to $2.33 per share. It will be payable next month.As of Monday's close, Home Depot shares are down about 2% over the past year, but up about 10% year to date. That compares with the S&P 500's nearly 14% gains over the past year and its roughly flat performance year to date.Correction: Home Depot acquired SRS Distribution for $18.25 billion in 2024. An earlier version misstated the time element.",

    "body": "The logo of pharmaceutical company Novo Nordisk is displayed in front of its offices in Bagsvaerd, Copenhagen, Denmark, Feb. 4, 2026.Tom Little | ReutersNovo Nordisk on Tuesday said it plans to slash the monthly list prices of its popular obesity and diabetes drugs in the U.S. by up to 50% starting in 2027, in a bid to make the treatments more accessible to patients with insurance coverage. The obesity injection Wegovy, its new pill counterpart, the diabetes shot Ozempic and the oral diabetes drug Rybelsus will have a new lower list price of $675 per month starting on Jan. 1, 2027. The Wegovy medicines both currently have list prices of around $1,350 per month, while the diabetes drugs have list prices of around $1,027 per month. For the first time, Novo said its price cuts are targeting insured patients whose out-of-pocket costs are linked to list prices, such as people with high-deductible health plans or coinsurance benefit designs. \"Both of these patient populations should, beginning [in 2027], see a benefit with lower out-of-pocket burdens,\" Jamey Millar, the company's head of U.S. operations, told CNBC in an interview. He added that Novo expects improvements in access and uptake among patients in the commercial insurance market, though the company is not giving any specific expectations.The move could help Novo compete better with Eli Lilly, which now holds the majority share in the blockbuster GLP-1 market. Lilly's more effective drugs and earlier foray into the direct-to-consumer space have allowed it to take the lead in the space, but the company has yet to significantly lower the U.S. list prices of its medicines.watch nowIt's unclear exactly how much commercial insured patients typically pay out of pocket for Novo's drugs. Those patients may pay as little as $25 per month for Novo's drugs in \"only the best of circumstances,\" Millar said. But patients in high-deductible plans would have to pay out of pocket \"more or less the full list price of a drug until they reach that\" threshold and the insurance benefit kicks in, he added. Millar said some of those patients defer treatment entirely because they don't want to shoulder that expense. The number of patients using high-deductible plans has increased over the years due to the trade-off of lower premiums, he noted. Meanwhile, Millar said other people have 25% to 33% of their coinsurance linked to the list prices of those drugs.The Danish drugmaker has previously cut the direct-to-consumer prices of Wegovy and Ozempic, which primarily benefit cash-paying patients who often don't have insurance coverage for the drugs. Novo offers its drugs to cash-paying patients for $149 to $499 per month, depending on the specific product and dose. Novo and Lilly have escalated a GLP-1 pricing war over the last year, especially following the landmark \"most favored nation\" deals they struck with President Donald Trump in November.The move also coincides with new, lower Medicare prices going into effect for Novo's obesity and diabetes drugs in 2027 following negotiations with the federal government under the Inflation Reduction Act. The new negotiated prices for Wegovy, Ozempic and Rybelsus will be $274 per month. ",

    "body": "watch nowPresident Donald Trump is set to deliver his prime-time State of the Union address at 9 p.m. ET Tuesday night as polls indicate voters are souring on his economy, after he made promises to lower prices for working-class voters.Trump will speak at a critical moment. The midterm elections, looming less than nine months away, threaten to rip away the near-complete control of Washington he has enjoyed in his second term. And public polling indicates Trump is sinking on what were once his key issues: the economy and immigration. The economy is expected to feature heavily in Trump's address, especially after the Supreme Court last week overturned his authority to issue a wide swath of his tariffs — a key plank of his economic platform. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told CNBC in a statement that the president's speech will highlight how, in \"one year, President Trump has turned our country around from the brink of disaster, and he will rightly declare the State of Our Union is strong, prosperous, and respected.\"He will \"proudly tout his Administration's many record-breaking accomplishments\" and will lay out \"an ambitious agenda to continue bringing the American Dream back for working people,\" Leavitt said.The president is also going to address energy prices in his address, according to the vice president. \"You're going to hear a lot about the importance of bringing jobs back to our country,\" Vice President JD Vance said in a Fox News interview on Saturday. \"I think he's going to talk about regulatory change, the importance of lowering energy prices for American citizens.\"High prices for everyday goods are one of the biggest problems facing Trump in his second term. Democrats are hounding the president and other Republicans on affordability, an issue that resonates with voters. That includes the costs of utilities, healthcare, prescription drugs, food and housing, along with a slew of other costs.In a CNN/SSRS poll released Monday, a whopping 57% of respondents said what they most wanted Trump to speak about in his State of the Union was the economy. Immigration was a distant second, with only 13% of those polled saying they would most like the president to speak on it.Democrats have opened up a 4.8-point lead in the generic congressional ballot leading up to the 2026 midterms, according to RealClearPolitics polling averages. Trump is underwater 13 points in that same average. Meanwhile, 57% of voters disapproving of his handling of the economy in a recent Washington Post/Reuters/Ipsos poll. President Donald Trump speaks during an address to a joint session of Congress at the Capitol in Washington, March 4, 2025.Mandel Ngan | Via Reuters\"It's the economy predominantly,\" said David Paleologos, a pollster and the director of the Suffolk University Political Research Center, when asked about the top issue Trump needs to address during his speech. \"I'm not saying Trump has to have an 'I feel your pain' moment like [former President] Bill Clinton, but he has to kind of liken himself to fellow Americans who have been hurt and knocked down.\"In recent speeches on the economy, Trump has touted his moves to lower prescription drug prices, including striking deals with manufacturers and the launch of his online drug site, TrumpRx.\"It's the biggest price reduction of prescription drugs in history,\" Trump said during a January speech in Des Moines, Iowa. \"Going to have a huge impact on your health care, too.\"Trump has also recently tried to shift blame for affordability onto Democrats, arguing in Iowa that Democrats \"just say affordability, but they never do anything.\"\"I was fixing the country from the horror show that we inherited. Grocery prices, airfares, hotels, car payments and rent prices have all come down. And they've come down very fast,\" Trump said. The president and Republicans in Congress have also touted tax cuts they pushed through in the party-line law they dubbed the \"one big beautiful bill.\" Democrats, meanwhile, are going to respond to the president's State of the Union in several ways. Democratic Gov. Abigail Spanberger of Virginia will deliver the official rebuttal for Democrats after romping to victory in 2025 on an affordability-focused agenda.  Abigail Spanberger is sworn in as the 75th governor of Virginia on Jan. 17, 2026, in Richmond. She is the first woman to serve as Virginia's governor.Marvin Joseph | The Washington Post | Getty ImagesSpanberger's speech is expected to focus heavily on costs, along with issues like whether the president has overreached in his efforts to deport migrants. The Trump administration has come under fire for its immigration enforcement after two U.S. citizens were shot and killed by federal agents in Minneapolis. \"We are at a defining moment in our nation's history. Virginians and Americans across the country are contending with rising costs, chaos in their communities, and a real fear of what each day might bring,\" Spanberger said in a statement when she was announced as the official rebuttal speaker.\"Abigail Spanberger, I think, will stay on message,\" Paleologos said. \"The average voter, and certainly the average swing voter, is measured and reasonable. And the person who flies off the handle potentially will be the loser.\" A group of Democrats plan to attend an alternative event dubbed the \"People's State of the Union,\" being put on by the progressive advocacy group MoveOn and the left-wing media company MeidasTouch. Among the big names eschewing Trump's speech for the alternative event are Sens. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., and Ed Markey, D-Mass., along with Rep. Greg Casar, D-Texas, chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus. \"These aren't normal times and showing up for this speech puts a veneer of legitimacy on the corruption and lawlessness that has defined his second term,\" Murphy said in a statement on the boycott.Other Democrats will attend the speech. House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries has urged his members to avoid splashy protests if they attend.\"The two options that are in front of us, in our house, is to either attend with silent defiance or to not attend and send a message to Donald Trump in that fashion,\" Jeffries said.

    "body": "Michael Selig, President Donald Trump's nominee to lead the Commodity Futures Trading Commission speaks during a Senate Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry Committee hearing on Capitol Hill on Nov. 19, 2025 in Washington, DC. Andrew Harnik | Getty ImagesSix Democratic senators told the Commodity Futures Trading Commission in a previously unreported letter that they have strong concerns about prediction market contracts \"that incentivize physical injury or death,\" saying the contracts \"present dangerous national security risks.\"The senators urged CFTC Chairman Michael Selig in the letter sent Monday to \"clearly reiterate that the CFTC will categorically prohibit any contract that resolves upon or closely correlates to an individual's death.\"The letter, led by Sen. Adam Schiff of California, notes that under federal commodity regulations, the CFTC already \"categorically prohibits\" contracts that involve or reference terrorism, assassination, war or similar actions. The letter was sent as prediction markets such as Polymarket and Kalshi have become increasingly popular and as questions have been raised about how those markets should be regulated, whether they are contributing to a rise in gambling addiction, and about the risk of people with inside information taking positions on contracts.The letter notes that the CFTC \"has cleared the way\" for Polymarket to reenter the U.S. market after U.S. users being ostensibly blocked from accessing contracts on the company's offshore exchange.In addition to Schiff, the Democrats who signed the letter are Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, New Jersey's Cory Booker, Tim Kaine of Virginia, and Nevada's Catherine Cortez Masto and Jacky Rosen.The CFTC didn't immediately respond to a request for comment about the letter, which cites three contracts offered by Polymarket in recent months relating to a NASA spaceship launch, the fate of Venezuela's authoritarian leader, and Russia's invasion of Ukraine.\"These recent events highlight the lack of internal controls and safeguards to prevent insiders from profiting off of non-public information, and direct profiteering off of human suffering,\" the letter said.The CFTC last week filed a legal brief in a federal appeals court asserting that the commission has exclusive jurisdiction over the U.S. commodity derivatives markets and that individual states had no role in exercising such oversight.\"The CFTC will no longer sit idly by while overzealous state governments undermine the agency's exclusive jurisdiction over these markets by  seeking to establish statewide prohibitions on these exciting products,\" Selig wrote in a Wall Street Journal op-ed about the filing.The senators' letter noted that one of Polymarket's contracts asked if Artemis II, the upcoming NASA crewed spaceflight mission, would explode.That contract, which Polymarket listed on Jan. 20, saw the bet \"Yes\" trading as high as 8% before it \"was subsequently renamed and ultimately withdrawn due to public backlash,\" the letter said.\"Not only did this contract directly correlate with crewmember death, it incentivized the failure of the mission and potential insider sabotage,\" the letter said.Polymarket in a Feb. 15 post on X about the controversy said, \"To clarify: this was a market about a potential booster-stage rupture — a defined hardware failure scenario — not about the Orion crew capsule or astronaut safety. This was not a market on crew injury or loss of life.\"Another contract on Polymarket was on the question of whether Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro would be removed from power. On Jan. 5, an unknown trader made $20,000 in bets that Maduro would be out by Jan. 31, and about two hours after those bets were placed, President Donald Trump ordered a military strike on Venezuela that led to Maduro's capture and removal to the United States for criminal prosecution.\"When Polymarket resolved the contract around twelve hours later, this trader had netted more than $400,000 in profits,\" the letter noted, citing reporting by The Wall Street Journal.A Polymarket advertisement in a subway station in New York, US, on Thursday, Feb. 5, 2026. Michael Nagle | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesIn the third example cited by the senators,  \"In November 2025, Polymarket resolved a contract that the Ukrainian town of Myrnohad would be captured by Russian forces by November 15, and individuals who bet YES profited by as much as 33,000 percent.\"\"Public reporting later found that a staffer at the Institute for the Study of War, a D.C. based think tank, had edited its map to show that Russia had taken control of a key intersection in the town, 'despite the lack of indications' that Russia had made any such advance,\" the senators wrote. \"This is a contract that unambiguously 'involves, relates to, or references' war and clearly displays the dangers of listing such contracts.\"The letter said the three contracts \"underscore the dangerous incentives directly or indirectly tied to offering contracts related to prohibited categories under the\" Commodity Exchange Act.The senators warned that government officials, regulated entities and consultants who may have knowledge about possible policy changes \"can easily act on confidential or operationally sensitive information to personally profit in markets that operate with minimal oversight or transparency, or share this information with contacts who can similarly profit.\"\"These contracts further risk incentivizing real-world harm by creating financial rewards linked to destabilizing events or physical injury, and by encouraging actors to influence or precipitate those outcomes for personal profit,\" the letter said.",

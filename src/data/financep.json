The Supreme Court is scheduled to hear arguments on Nov. 5 on Trump's request that it overturn lower-court rulings, which found that a president does not have authority under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to impose the country-specific tariffs he implemented earlier this year.The White House did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment on Trump's statement.",

Hussein Faleh | AFP | Getty ImagesU.S. President Donald Trump said Wednesday that Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi told him New Delhi will stop buying oil from Russia, though the move will take time.\"[Modi] assured me today that they will not be buying oil from Russia. That's a big stop.\" Trump said at the press briefing in the Oval Office. \"Now we've got to get China to do the same thing.\"He added that Washington was unhappy with New Delhi's purchases of Russian crude because it allowed Moscow to continue waging its \"ridiculous war\" in Ukraine.However, the U.S. president also said that the halt will not be immediate, and there will be \"a little bit of a process,\" without giving a clear timeline.CNBC reached out to India's Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas for comment, but did not receive an immediate reply.India's imports of Russian oil have been a sticking point in the relationship between Washington and New Delhi. Trump slapped additional tariffs of 25% on India back in August, raising the total levy to 50%, while India has called out the U.S. for its trade with Russia.\"If India doesn't buy [Russian] oil, it makes [ending the war] much easier,\" Trump said. \"They assured me within a short period of time, they will not be buying oil from Russia, and they will go back to Russia after the war is over.\"On Thursday, Brent crude futures climbed 0.82% to $62.43 a barrel by 10:31 p.m. ET, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate futures climbed 0.89% to $58.79.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconIndia is one of the biggest buyers of Russian oil. Data from research firm Kpler shows Russia exports about 3.35 million barrels of crude per day, with India taking about 1.7 million and China 1.1 million.New Delhi has defended those purchases, with Energy Minister Hardeep Singh Puri telling CNBC in July that New Delhi helped stabilize global energy prices and was encouraged by the U.S. to do so.\"If people or countries had stopped buying at that stage, the price of oil would have gone up to 130 dollars a barrel. That was a situation in which we were advised, including by our friends in the United States, to please buy Russian oil, but within the price cap,\" Puri said.Russian sales of crude oil have been placed under a price cap by the G7 nations and the European Union since Moscow's 2022 invasion of Ukraine.That price cap, set at $47.6 per barrel, aims to limit Moscow's revenue from oil exports, constricting the country's ability to finance its war in Ukraine.Stock Chart IconStock chart icon",

    "body": "U.S. Senator Maria Cantwell (D-WA) speaks during a press conference following the weekly policy luncheon, on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C., U.S., June 3, 2025. Annabelle Gordon | ReutersDemocratic Sen. Maria Cantwell on Wednesday asked the U.S. Office of Special Counsel to investigate Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem for \"likely\" violating the Hatch Act by making a video to be shown in airports blaming Democrats for the government shutdown.The Hatch Act bars federal employees, including Cabinet secretaries, from engaging in political activity while acting in their official role.Multiple major airports have refused to show Noem's video near passenger screening lines, including Seattle-Tacoma International Airport in Cantwell's home state of Washington, as well as airports in Chicago and New York.A number of airports specifically mentioned the video's potential violation of the Hatch Act in their decision. The Office of Special Counsel is responsible for investigating potential Hatch Act violations.In a letter to acting Special Counsel Jamieson Greer, Cantwell called out Noem for \"airing a partisan video message — on televisions in public airports across the country — in which she erroneously blames 'Democrats in Congress' for the current government shutdown's impact on airport 'operations' and for Transportation Security Administration ... employees 'working without pay.'\"\"This message is not just false; it appears to violate the prohibitions contained in the Hatch Act,\" wrote Cantwell, who is a member of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation.Cantwell said recent reports indicate that DHS is using taxpayer dollars and federal assets to produce and air the video, in which Noem appears in her official capacity.The letter notes that Noem, in the video, stands in front of an American flag alongside the official insignia of Homeland Security.\"When viewed in its totality, Secretary Noem's video can only be reasonably interpreted as a partisan message intended to misleadingly malign the Trump Administration's political opponents, convince Americans to blame 'Democrats in Congress' for the ongoing government shutdown, and influence their future votes — all while omitting the fact that Republicans currently control the White House, U.S. Senate, and U.S. House of Representatives,\" Cantwell wrote.\"As the independent agency responsible for enforcing the Hatch Act, I urge you to investigate this matter immediately,\" she wrote Greer.DHS didn't immediately respond to a request for comment on Cantwell's letter.A spokesperson for Port of Seattle, which operates the Seattle-Tacoma airport, said Noem's video was not being played \"due to the political nature of the content.\"A spokesperson for Portland International Airport in Oregon told CNBC that the airport \"did not consent to playing the video in its current form, as we believe the Hatch Act clearly prohibits use of public assets for political purposes and messaging.\"",

The order blocks the Trump administration from taking any action to follow through with those workers' termination, or to issue RIFs to other federal employees protected by two unions that filed a lawsuit to prevent the firings.\"The activities that are being undertaken here are contrary to the laws,\" San Francisco U.S. District Court Judge Susan Yvonne Illston told lawyers for the administration on Wednesday at a hearing where she issued the TRO.\"You can't do this in a nation of laws,\" Illston said, according to NBC News. \"And we have laws here, and the things that are being articulated here are not within the law.\"The judge cited comments by President Donald Trump and White House Budget Director Russell Vought that have indicated the workers were being laid off explicitly to target programs favored by Democrats.In a written order issued later Wednesday, Illston called the firings during a shutdown \"unprecedented.\"\"It is also far from normal for an administration to fire line-level civilian employees during agovernment shutdown as a way to punish the opposing political party,\" Illston wrote.\"But this is precisely what President Trump has announced he is doing, by taking to social media on the second day of the shutdown to post: 'I have a meeting today with Russ Vought, he of PROJECT 2025 Fame, to determine which of the many Democrat Agencies, most of which are a political SCAM, he recommends to be cut, and whether or not those cuts will be temporary or permanent. I can't believe the Radical Left Democrats gave me this unprecedented opportunity.'\"Two unions representing tens of thousands of federal workers had asked Illston to block the RIFs, and the order Illston issued applies to any employee represented by those unions. She scheduled a hearing for Oct. 28 on the unions' request for a preliminary injunction that would continue to block the Trump administration from restarting the RIFs. The unions are the American Federation of Government Employees, and the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees.The Trump administration had warned that it would lay off workers during the shutdown, and Trump has repeatedly said that the cuts were aimed at \"Democrat agencies\" or initiatives.Shortly before Illston issued her order blocking layoffs, Vought, during an interview on \"The Charlie Kirk Show,\" said that he expected that \"north of 10,000\" federal jobs would be cut because of their shutdown.Read more CNBC government shutdown coverageJudge blocks Trump from firing federal workers during government shutdown for nowKristi Noem's shutdown airport video may violate Hatch Act, Sen.

    "body": "John Furner, Walmart U.S. CEO, speaks to CNBC’s Sara Eisen during the Invest in America Forum on Oct. 15, 2025.Aaron Clamage | CNBCManufacturing is seeing renewed attention from corporate America, with Walmart among the major companies publicly reaffirming its commitment to domestic production. At CNBC's inaugural Invest in America Forum, Walmart U.S. CEO John Furner said the company is increasing its investments in U.S.-made products and suppliers, describing it as part of a long-standing, strategic priority. \"Investing in U.S. manufacturing and U.S. operations, sure, it's great for business, but it's also great for employment. It's great for jobs. It's great for the country, and it helps us with our supply chain being flexible and dynamic,\" Furner said. Nearly two-thirds of the products Walmart sells are made, grown or assembled in the United States, according to Furner. Walmart is expanding on that front, including a new beef processing facility in Olathe, Kansas, which he said is expected to create over 600 jobs. \"It's a big investment, and having quality products that are sourced in a more sustainable way that can deliver to customers is really important,\" Furner said. Furner also pointed to specific categories where domestic production is being revived, citing a recent partnership with USAntibiotics aimed at \"bringing back products like amoxicillin so that they're made here in the United States.\"Still, global sourcing remains essential for Walmart's operations. \"We source from all around the world,\" Furner said. \"There are things that are grown around the world that tend to do better in other climates, you know, coffee might be an example … I think there are a lot of possibilities.\"The heightened public focus on U.S. manufacturing comes amid trade policy uncertainty, with tariffs and interest rates remaining central to retailers' equation of how much inventory to stock and what to set prices at. For his part, Furner was uncertain about the future for the levies. \"As policies change, they'll change. Environments will change. That happens. Commodities change,\" he said. \"We've landed in a place where we have more rollbacks going into the fall than we had at the beginning of the year, and that's something we're proud of.\"Despite uncertain economic headwinds, Furner said Walmart is pushing to lower prices for consumers. \"We want to try to keep prices as low as we can, as long as we can,\" he said. \"We see a resilient customer that makes really smart choices for what's right for them and their families at the time of shopping.\"",

David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesPresident Donald Trump's tariffs are pushing inflation generally higher as companies are caught between absorbing the costs or passing them onto customers, according to a Federal Reserve report Wednesday.The central bank's periodic Beige Book report, published eight times a year generally at about six-week intervals, categorized overall economic growth as having \"changed little\" since the last report on Sept. 3. Labor markets \"were largely stable\" as demand was \"muted\" for most of the Fed's 12 districts.When it came to prices, though, Trump's duties implemented in April and then staggered through ensuing months showed an impact.\"Prices rose further during the reporting period,\" the report stated. \"Tariff-induced input cost increases were reported across many Districts, but the extent of those higher costs passing through to final prices varied.\"In some cases, firms held prices unchanged to stay competitive and to appease inflation-sensitive clients. However, some businesses said they were \"fully passing higher import costs along to their customers.\"A few districts reported that slowing demand actually pushed prices down for materials.The trade war has escalated in recent days as China has ordered restrictions on coveted rare earths materials, while Trump has retaliated with a threat of 100% tariffs on Chinese imports.The release comes amid a dearth of relevant economic data due to a government shutdown entering its third week. Key providers such as the Labor and Commerce departments are largely closed due to the impasse.However, Bureau of Labor Statistics workers have been called back to release the pivotal consumer price index report used both as an inflation gauge and to index cost of living adjustments for Social Security recipients.

    "body": "A United Airlines Boeing 737-MAX 8 aircraft departs at San Diego International Airport en route to New York on Aug. 24, 2024.Kevin Carter | Getty ImagesUnited Airlines on Wednesday forecast higher-than-expected earnings for the fourth quarter after a rocky start to 2025.The carrier expects to earn between $3 and $3.50 a share for the last three months of the year, compared with analysts' estimate of $2.86 a share.United has been expanding its flying capacity, while its rivals have scaled back some of their growth plans after a glut of flights weighed on fares this year. The airline increased capacity 7% in the third quarter over last year. Unit passenger revenue for the three months ended Sept. 30 fell 3.3% for domestic travel and 7.1% for international. Sales from its lucrative loyalty program rose 9%.In an interview last month, United CEO Scott Kirby last month defended the airline's growth plan and said the carrier was winning loyal customers through its network, new technology like complimentary inflight Wi-Fi, refreshed cabins and new lounges.\"Those investments over almost a decade, combined with great service from our people, have allowed United to win and retain brand-loyal customers, leading to economic resilience even with macro economic volatility through the first three quarters of the year and significant upside as the economy and demand are improving in the fourth quarter,\" Kirby said in a release on Wednesday.Still, for the third quarter, United beat earnings expectations, although its revenue fell short of estimates.Here is what United Airlines reported for the quarter that ended Sept. 30 compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on estimates compiled by LSEG:Earnings per share: $2.78 adjusted vs. $2.62 expectedRevenue: $15.23 billion vs. $15.33 billion expectedUnited's third-quarter revenue was $15.23 billion, up 2.6% from $14.84 billion last year. Net income fell 1.7% to $949 million or $2.90 a share. Adjusting for one-time items including debt, among other things, United posted income of $909 million or $2.78 a share.The carrier is vying with Delta Air Lines to win over more affluent travelers who shell out more for seats, and it has expanded its global network with far-flung destinations like Greenland and Mongolia. United said in the third quarter, its premium-cabin revenue, which includes first class and other, roomier seats, rose 6%. United's sales from no-frills basic economy 4% year-over-year.In the spring and early summer, United and other carriers trimmed their earnings forecasts they made at the start of the year, after passenger demand dipped amid on-again-off-again tariffs, and an oversupply of flights weighed on airfare.",

Kyle Grillot | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesOpenAI CEO Sam Altman said Wednesday that the company is \"not the elected moral police of the world\" after receiving backlash over his decision to loosen restrictions and allow content like erotica within its chatbot ChatGPT.The artificial intelligence startup has expanded its safety controls in recent months as it faced mounting scrutiny over how it protects users, particularly minors.But Altman said Tuesday in a post on X that OpenAI will be able to \"safely relax\" most restrictions now that it has new tools and has been able to mitigate \"serious mental health issues.\"In December, Altman said it will allow more content, including erotica, on ChatGPT for \"verified adults.\"Altman tried to clarify the move in a post on X on Wednesday, saying OpenAI cares \"very much about the principle of treating adult users like adults,\" but it will still not allow \"things that cause harm to others.\"\"In the same way that society differentiates other appropriate boundaries (R-rated movies, for example) we want to do a similar thing here,\" Altman wrote.The posts are at odds with comments Altman made during a podcast appearance in August, where he said he was \"proud\" of OpenAI's ability to resist certain features, like a \"sex bot avatar,\" that could boost engagement on ChatGPT.\"There's a lot of short-term stuff we could do that would really juice growth or revenue and be very misaligned with that long-term goal,\" Altman said. Read more CNBC tech news$1 trillion-worth of AI deals between OpenAI, Nvidia and others, in one chartWaymo plans robotaxi launch in London, marking its European debutASML looks to calm fears over 2026 growth as it warns of China sales declineMeta removes Facebook page allegedly used to target ICE agents after pressure from DOJIn September, the Federal Trade Commission launched an inquiry into OpenAI and other tech companies over how chatbots like ChatGPT could negatively affect children and teenagers. OpenAI is also named in a wrongful death lawsuit with a family who blamed ChatGPT for their teenage son's death by suicide.The company has taken several public steps to enhance safety on ChatGPT in the months following the inquiry and the lawsuit. It launched a series of parental controls late last month, and it is building an age prediction system that will automatically apply teen-appropriate settings for users under 18.On Tuesday, OpenAI announced assembled a council of eight experts who will provide insight into how AI impacts users' mental health, emotions and motivation. Altman posted about the company's aim to loosen restrictions that same day, sparking confusion and swift backlash on social media.Altman said it \"blew up\" much more than he was expecting.His post also caught the attention of advocacy groups like the National Center on Sexual Exploitation, which called on OpenAI to reverse its decision to allow erotica on ChatGPT.\"Sexualized AI chatbots are inherently risky, generating real mental health harms from synthetic intimacy; all in the context of poorly defined industry safety standards,\" Haley McNamara, NCOSE's executive director, said in a statement on Wednesday.If you are having suicidal thoughts or are in distress, contact the Suicide & Crisis Lifeline at 988 for support and assistance from a trained counselorWATCH: AI is not in a bubble, valuations look ‘pretty reasonable’, says BlackRockwatch now",

    "body": "Australia, Victoria, Melbourne, buildings on bank of Yarra riverPeter Adams | Stone | Getty ImagesSouth Korea's Kospi index hit a record high Thursday, after the International Monetary Fund raised the country's 2025 growth forecast to 0.9% from 0.8% in its October outlook report.The IMF also raised its growth projection for the global economy, saying the impact of U.S. tariffs was \"at the modest end of the range.\"It cited several reasons for upgrading the forecast, including the agility of the private sector, which front-loaded imports in the first half of the year and quickly reorganized supply chains to redirect trade flows; trade deals between the U.S. and other countries; and the overall restraint from much of the world, which largely kept the global trading system open.South Korean stocks also received a boost after U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told CNBC in an exclusive interview Wednesday stateside that Washington was \"about to finish up\" trade negotiations with the Asian country.\"The devil's in the details, but we are ironing out the details,\" he added.The autos, electronics and industrial equipment firms led gains on the Kospi index.

Kia also gained around 7%.South Korea's Kospi index advanced 1.09%, while the small-cap Kosdaq traded 0.2% higher.Shares of SK Inc., one of South Korea's biggest technology conglomerates, fell over 5% after the Supreme Court on Thursday partially overturned a previous ruling on Chairman Chey Tae-won's divorce settlement, local media reported.Last year, a lower court ordered Chey to pay about $1 billion to his estranged wife in a high-profile divorce lawsuit.Meanwhile, shares of SK Inc.'s subsidiary and chip maker SK Hynix jumped over 6%.Australian shares also hit new highInvestors have been on edge in recent days as global trade tensions have escalated. The Cboe Volatility Index (VIX), known to many as Wall Street's fear gauge, has trended higher over the past week, rising last Friday to more than 21.6, or its most elevated level since late May. The index finished at 20.6 on Wednesday stateside.Australia's ASX/S&P 200 rose to a new record after the country's seasonally adjusted unemployment rate jumped to a near four-year high in September at 4.5%. That compares with the 4.3% estimated by Reuters-polled economists and the 4.2% rate in August.Meanwhile, employment rose by 14,900 in September, missing expectations for a 20,000 rise. The weak jobs reading paves the way for further interest rate cuts.Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 index jumped 0.95%, while the Topix index added 0.8%.Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index fell 0.5%, while the Hang Seng Tech Index lost 1.53%. Mainland's CSI 300 added 0.52%.India's benchmark Nifty 50 rose 0.34%, while the Sensex index climbed 0.23%.U.S. equity futures were little changed in early Asian hours after major banks reported earnings beat, as Washington's government shutdown entered its third week and escalating trade tensions with China persisted.Overnight, the Dow Jones Industrial Average ended the day little changed, down just 17.15 points, or 0.04% at 46,253.31.

    "body": "watch nowThe Trump administration will set price floors across a range of industries to combat market manipulation by China, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told CNBC in an exclusive interview Wednesday.China has driven foreign competitors in the rare earth industry out of business over the past two decades by using its global dominance in refining and processing to slash prices, Bessent said.\"When you are facing a nonmarket economy like China, then you have to exercise industrial policy,\" Bessent told Sara Eisen at CNBC's Invest in America Forum in Washington, D.C.\"So we're going to set price floors and the forward buying to make sure that this doesn't happen again and we're going to do it across a range of industries,\" the Treasury secretary said, without naming specific industries the administration was looking at beyond rare earths.The U.S. also needs to set up a strategic mineral reserve, Bessent said. JPMorgan Chase is interested in working with the Trump administration to create such a reserve, he said.Rare earths are used to produce magnets that are crucial inputs in U.S. weapons systems like the F-35 warplane and Tomahawk cruise missiles. Rare earth magnets are also essential for civilian commercial applications like electric vehicles.The Trump administration has been working to stand up a domestic rare earth supply chain. The Department of Defense struck an unprecedented deal in July with MP Materials, the largest U.S. rare earth miner, that included an equity stake, a price floor and offtake agreement.China last week announced sweeping new restrictions on rare earth exports ahead of an expected meeting between President Xi Jinping and President Donald Trump in South Korea later this month. Trump has threatened to slap China with additional 100% tariffs in response.The U.S. could take equity stakes in other companies in the wake of Beijing's rare earth restrictions, Bessent told CNBC.\"I wouldn't be surprised,\" the Treasury secretary said when asked about additional equity stakes. \"When we get an announcement like this week with China on the rare earths, you realize we have to be self-sufficient, or we have to be sufficient with our allies.\"The Trump administration will not take stakes in nonstrategic industries, Bessent said. \"We do have to be very careful not to overreach,\" he said.Shares of rare earth and critical mineral miners have rallied over the past several sessions as investors speculate on which companies might be future targets for Trump administration industrial policy.",

    "body": "President Donald Trump holds a news conference with Elon Musk to mark the end of the Tesla CEO's tenure as a special government employee overseeing the U.S. DOGE Service on Friday May 30, 2025 in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington. Tom Brenner | The Washington Post | Getty ImagesGeneral Motors' announcement on Tuesday that its upcoming quarterly results will include a $1.6 billion charge from its electric vehicle investments is the latest in a string of troubling EV-related disclosures from big automakers.Ford CEO Jim Farley said late last month that he expects demand for fully electric vehicles to be slashed in half following the end of a federal tax credit program. His prediction came after Stellantis, the parent company of auto brands including Chrysler and Jeep, said it was scrapping its target of producing nothing but electric vehicles in Europe by 2030, and backed off ambitious targets for the U.S., notably for Chrysler.The industry, which was already facing hurdles imposed by the Trump administration, faces a hefty dose of uncertainty now that consumers can no longer take advantage of $7,500 tax credits for purchasing EVs. The incentives expired at the end of September as part of President Trump's signature spending bill.As automakers reset investor expectations, one name has been notably absent from the conversation: Tesla.Elon Musk's company is by far the largest seller of EVs in the U.S., though its market share has been sliding as competition has increased and its brand value has declined. Tesla's share of the all-electric market in the U.S. was estimated at 43.1% at the end of September, down from 49% at the end of last year, according to data provided to CNBC from Motor IntelligenceTesla is slated to report third-quarter results next week, and Wall Street will be eager to hear what kind of demand the company expects with the credits no longer available. Tesla recently unveiled stripped-down, lower-cost variants of its popular Model Y SUV and Model 3 sedans, offsetting some of the effective price increases that come with the loss of incentives.watch nowSteve Greenfield, general partner at investment firm Automotive Ventures, said the retreat of legacy automakers from the segment could be good news for Tesla as its market share may start to rebound. He said in an email that the company has \"very strong brand loyalty.\"\"Chances are, most Tesla buyers will continue to stay in the brand, as they buy their next new car,\" Greenfield said.However, significant challenges loom. Interest in battery electric vehicles \"is very likely to shrink dramatically\" in the fourth quarter, he said, due to the \"pull-ahead of demand,\" as consumers rushed to buy EVs before the credit expired. As the year ends, Tesla will likely face a \"double whammy,\" Greenfield said, from reduced BEV sales and lower margins on the cars they do sell.Tesla didn't respond to a request for comment.Investors have become more bullish. Following a 36% slump in the first quarter, the stock has rallied and is now up more than 7% for the year, aided by Musk's purchase of about $1 billion worth of Tesla stock in September.The brutal start to the year was linked to a consumer backlash in the U.S. and Europe in response to Musk's incendiary political rhetoric, his work for President Trump slashing the federal workforce, and his endorsements of far-right groups including Germany's AfD party.Sharing in the painIn the company's third-quarter earnings scheduled for next Wednesday, analysts are expecting to see revenue growth of 3.5% from a year earlier to $26.1 billion, according to LSEG. Analysts are projecting a revenue drop in the fourth quarter and a 3.5% slide for all of 2025, which would mark the first full-year decline on record.Earlier this month, Tesla reported a 7% year-over-year increase in quarterly vehicle deliveries for the third quarter. That marked a turnaround after two consecutive quarterly declines to start the year.\"It's not just a retreat of everybody else, and Tesla gets to run away with the market,\" said Mark Wakefield, global automotive market lead at Alix Partners, in an interview.Consumer demand for fully electric vehicles had \"already kind of flatlined a bit\" even before the Republican spending bill, Wakefield added. Car buyers have been looking for a \"breakthrough moment\" where EVs would become cost competitive with hybrid or gas-powered models.Wakefield added that \"this market needs a sense of newness,\" and that the new, lower-priced Model Y and Model 3 options are not exactly \"earth shattering.\"The Trump administration isn't making life easy.Robbie Orvis, a senior director at Energy Innovation, a nonpartisan climate policy think tank, told CNBC the automakers' writedowns were expected and stem entirely from policy changes beyond just the tax credits.The Trump White House has also \"revoked California's waiver to set its own vehicle standards, revoked billions in funding for EV chargers and for auto plants to retool to build EVs, and is in the process of undoing vehicle tailpipe standards that would encourage the adoption of EVs,\" Orvis said.Those policies, along with tariffs, have already caused billions of dollars in losses for U.S. automakers, which means they aren't in a position to invest in new market segments, Orvis said.Tesla is experiencing its share of that pain, and it's showing up most acutely in international markets.\"Chinese automakers are rapidly displacing U.S. automakers in foreign markets as they are able to offer cheaper, higher-quality new cars, particularly EVs, in markets where there is large and growing demand for these cars,\" Orvis said.The Tesla Bot humanoid robot of Tesla ''Optimus'' is displayed at the 2023 World Artificial Intelligence Conference in Shanghai, China, July 6, 2023.Costfoto | Nurphoto | Getty ImagesMusk, meanwhile, continues to try and focus investor attention elsewhere.He insists the future of the company hinges on robotaxis and humanoid robotics, two markets that Tesla has yet to meaningfully crack. Tesla is testing its Robotaxi-branded service in limited capacity in some cities, but is way behind Alphabet's Waymo, which is rapidly expanding commercial operations.Musk said in March that Tesla aimed to make 5,000 of its Optimus robots this year, but key departures from the group have thrown that plan into question.In September, Musk wrote on X that \"~80% of Tesla's value will be Optimus.\" Last year, he predicted that Optimus robots would someday turn Tesla into a $25 trillion company, which was equal to more than half of the entire value of the S&P 500 at the time of his comment.It's a story that's compelling enough for some longtime Tesla bulls and Musk fanboys. But at the moment, the company still relies on sales of EVs to drive its business. And in the U.S., while Tesla's market share may be poised to rise, the overall pie — at least in the near term — appears to be shrinking.— CNBC's Mike Wayland contributed to this reportWATCH: Former Ford CEO says EV market didn't develop way automakers thoughtwatch now",

Trump | Via Truth SocialAs artificial intelligence startups raise increasingly large sums of cash to fund their swelling infrastructure needs, they're turning to strategic partners like Nvidia and big venture firms such as Thrive Capital, Sequoia and Andreessen Horowitz.But one major financier has a name that's less familiar in the world of tech investing: MGX.Backed by Abu Dhabi's sovereign wealth fund and launched in March 2024, MGX has emerged as a key source of capital as hyperscalers Microsoft, Meta and Google, and startups like OpenAI race to build out the enormous computing power needed to meet expected AI demand.In September, MGX made another big splash, joining Oracle and Silver Lake in President Donald Trump's push to get TikTok under U.S. control.And on Wednesday, MGX was back in the news as part of another giant AI deal. MGX is joining investors including Nvidia, Microsoft, BlackRock and Elon Musk's xAI in purchasing Aligned Data Centers for $40 billion, the largest global data center deal to date. Aligned designs and operates facilities across North and South America.MGX was formed out of a joint venture between Group 42 (G42), a tech holding company based in the United Arab Emirates, and Mubadala Investment Company. Despite the geopolitical concerns that come with bringing vast amounts of Middle Eastern money into critical U.S. infrastructure, tech companies are welcoming MGX and its deep pockets into the fold.MGX's first major announcement in the U.S. landed in the fall of 2024, not quite two years after OpenAI's ChatGPT set the generative AI boom in motion.In its initial deal, MGX joined a consortium — now called AI Infrastructure Partnership (AIP) — formed by firms including BlackRock and Microsoft, to spend $100 billion on AI infrastructure, primarily in the U.S. Separately, Microsoft invested $1.5 billion in G42 to develop AI technologies in the Middle East, with G42 using Microsoft's Azure cloud service to power it all.The AIP consortium is also MGX's avenue into the latest deal for Aligned.watch nowMGX has since joined as a partner in Stargate, the $500 billion Trump-endorsed joint venture with OpenAI, Oracle and SoftBank to build AI infrastructure across the U.S. According to PitchBook, MGX has also invested in numerous companies over the past year, including Databricks, Anthropic and xAI. Its chairman is Tahnoon bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the national security advisor of the UAE and a brother of the country's president.Certain transactions suggest a level of coziness with Trump.Earlier this year, MGX reportedly provided $2 billion in funding to the crypto exchange Binance, using a cryptocurrency purchased from the Trump family's World Liberty Financial. Al Nahyan also visited President Trump in the White House this spring to announce a $1.4 trillion investment in the U.S. over the next decade.'Backdoor deal'And then came TikTok.On Sept. 25, Trump signed an executive order backing a proposed deal to keep the social media app, owned by China's ByteDance, running in the U.S.ByteDance faced an ultimatum under a federal law, passed with bipartisan support from members of Congress, requiring it to either divest the platform's American business or be shut down in the U.S.As part of Trump's executive order, MGX joined with Oracle and Silver Lake to take a combined 45% of TikTok USA, though details still haven't been officially announced.Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., blasted the arrangement.\"MGX – a shady Abu Dhabi firm – has already cut deals to get sensitive American technology while enriching the Trump family's crypto firm,\" Warren said in a statement last month. \"The American people deserve to know if the President has struck another backdoor deal for this billionaire takeover of TikTok.\"Representatives for MGX, OpenAI, Microsoft and BlackRock declined to comment for this story.The steel frame of data centers under construction during a tour of the OpenAI data center in Abilene, Texas, U.S., Sept. 23, 2025. Shelby Tauber | ReutersPatrick Moorhead, an analyst at Moor Insights & Strategy, said tech companies in the U.S. may need to partner with Middle East firms on AI in order to keep them from instead working with our chief international adversary.\"I believe in the Middle East… we either provide the goods or they will go to China,\" Moorhead said.Moorhead added that MGX is following the same playbook as Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund. They're trying to diversify away from oil, and AI is one area where they can put money to work.\"The amount of capital required is astronomical,\" Moorhead said. \"And they're willing to take the risks.\"Even though tech giants like Microsoft, Meta and Amazon have enough cash to fund their AI ambitions, additional resources are always welcome. That's also why many AI leaders are renting AI capacity from companies like CoreWeave instead of building it all themselves.\"I think they will find real acceptance among VCs because people are comfortable with sovereign wealth,\" said Bradley Tusk, a venture capitalist and co-founder of Tusk Capital Partners. \"This is a tough fundraising environment, so they're a potentially good source of capital.\"Tusk warned that MGX could get entangled in U.S. politics and the perception that it's too close to the Trump administration, which could be problematic if a Democrat is in the White House in the coming years.\"I think the biggest risk is that the only narrative right now is they are Trump's friends,\" Tusk said.WATCH: Oracle, OpenAI and SoftBank unveil $400 billion Stargate data center expansion.watch now",

    "body": "watch nowArm Holdings CEO Rene Haas told CNBC's Jim Cramer on Wednesday that moving some AI functions away from the could help reduce energy usage.Over time, he suggested, a large number of multi-gigawatt data centers won't be sustainable.\"You look to yourself, well, what are the kind of things that need to happen? I think there's two vectors to it,\" Haas said. \"One is low power, the lowest power solution you can get in the cloud. Arm really contributes there. But I think even more specifically is moving those AI workloads away from the cloud to local applications.\"While he said AI training will likely always happen in the cloud, running AI, called inference, can happen locally — meaning on the chips inside people's phones, computers and glasses. History has shown \"we always go to hybrid models around computing,\" according to Haas.He suggested that hybrid dynamic will play out when it comes to AI, which will help alleviate huge power investments.Chip designer Arm's technology powers devices made by a number of major Big Tech players, including Microsoft and Amazon. Semiconductor giant Nvidia has a major stake in Arm and actually attempted to acquire the company in 2020.Arm and Meta on Wednesday said they would expand their partnership to \"scale AI efficiency across every layer of compute – spanning AI software and data center infrastructure,\" according to a press release. Arm stock saw gains following the announcement, finishing the day up 1.49%.Haas told Cramer that the partnership with Meta is \"largely around data centers, but more broadly...around software and the software stacks associated with it.\" He also discussed Arm's involvement in Meta's new Ray-Ban Wayfarer glasses, saying the AI for the technology is running both in the cloud and locally.\"For example, when you say, 'hey, Meta,' into those glasses, that's not happening on the cloud, that's actually happening in your glasses, and that's running on Arm,\" Haas said.Sign up now for the CNBC Investing Club to follow Jim Cramer's every move in the market.Disclaimer The CNBC Investing Club Charitable Trust owns shares of Meta, Microsoft, Amazon and Nvidia.Questions for Cramer?

    "body": "Sanae Takaichi, Japan's prime minister and president of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), speaks at an LDP election rally in Kawagoe, Saitama Prefecture, Japan, on Tuesday, Feb. 3, 2026. Traders are bracing for increased volatility as the Feb. 8 lower house election approaches. Photographer: Soichiro Koriyama/Bloomberg via Getty ImagesBloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesJapan's Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi is poised to lead her ruling coalition to a landslide victory in this weekend's snap election, a Nikkei poll has shown. The poll, conducted from Tuesday to Thursday, showed that the Liberal Democratic Party and its coalition partner, the Japan Innovation Party, were likely to secure more than 300 of the 465 seats in the Lower House. The findings echo an earlier poll by the Japanese daily Asahi Shimbun, which also projected that the ruling bloc would gain more than 300 seats. The Central Reform Alliance — an alliance of the Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan and Komeito — is forecast to have its seat count roughly halved from the current 167 seats, according to the Nikkei poll.Separate polling by Kyodo News suggests the LDP could secure a single-party majority of more than 233 seats on its own.According to Nikkei, the LDP now has its sights on surpassing 261 seats, a threshold that would allow it to control all parliamentary committees and chair positions.A two-thirds majority in the Lower House would also give the ruling party the power to override an Upper House veto when it comes to passing legislation.The election follows political upheaval last year, when the LDP lost its majority in the Upper House, and a Lower House defeat in 2024, which prompted then-Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba to resign in September.The poll also comes as U.S. President Donald Trump publicly expressed support for the ruling coalition, announcing in a Truth Social post that he planned to meet Takaichi on March 19.Trump added, \"it is my Honor to give a Complete and Total Endorsement of her, and what her highly respected Coalition is representing. SHE WILL NOT LET THE PEOPLE OF JAPAN DOWN!\" Takaichi had staked her political future on this election, vowing to resign if the ruling coalition fails to secure a majority.With her high personal approval ratings, the fiercely conservative prime minister is looking to convert that popularity into votes for the LDP and her coalition. Kristi Govella, Japan Chair at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, previously told CNBC that a clear victory would reflect Takaichi's personal popularity, instead of any improvements in economic conditions in Japan.\"Little else has changed since July when the LDP was drubbed at the polls,\" Govella added.",

    "body": "Rafael Henrique | SOPA Images | APThe stock of Hims & Hers dropped in premarket trading early Friday after a legal threat from Novo Nordisk.The online teleheath company announced on Thursday plans to launch a cheaper, copycat version of Novo's weight loss pill, prompting Novo to take legal action.Hims stock spiked as much as 15% on the news in Thursday trading, but quickly pared gains and ended the session down 3.8% at a 12-month low after Novo said the action was \"illegal.\" Shares fell another 6.7% in premarket trading Friday.Hims said it will launch a Wegovy-style pill containing the same active ingredient as the original brand, semaglutide, for as little as $49 for the first month when customers sign up for a subscription. After the first month, the price will rise to $99. That's significantly lower than the $149 Novo Nordisk sells its starting dose for on its direct-to-consumer website NovoCare. Stock Chart IconStock chart iconHims & Hers stock has been volatile over the past year.Hims is launching its pill even though semaglutide has patent protection in the U.S. until 2032. The telehealth firm's business flourished when it started selling compounded semaglutide in an injectable format, using a loophole in U.S. regulation that allows competitors to sell a drug protected by intellectual property laws if the drug is in short supply.In the early days of the Wevovy jab, demand significantly outstripped supply, but Novo Nordisk has since invested heavily in manufacturing capacity and resolved the supply issues. There are no shortages reported for the pill version.Hims says that its versions are \"personalized\" in dosage, and therefore legal. Novo says the action is illegal and a risk to patient safety. \"This is another example of Hims & Hers' historic behaviour of duping the American public with knock-off GLP-1 products, and the FDA has previously warned them about their deceptive advertising of GLP-1 knock-offs,\" Novo said in a statement Thursday.Hims is a volatile stock, inherently tied to its perceived ability to sell weight loss drugs like its Wegovy copy. Shares have hit highs of $69 and lows of $23 in the past 12 months.Leerink Partners analyst Michael Cherny, who rates Hims stock at \"Market Perform,\" suggested the telehealth provider could also consider launching copycat versions of Eli Lilly's weight loss drugs. Lilly didn't respond to a CNBC request for comment.Meanwhile, Barclays analyst James Gordon called the $49 Wegovy copy a \"new concern\" for Novo.\"While compounded alternatives may attract cost-sensitive patients in the near term, questions remain about their regulatory sustainability and clinical consistency,\" he added.

Tomohiro Ohsumi | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesToyota Motor announced Friday that Chief Executive Officer Koji Sato will step down and be replaced by its Chief Financial Officer, Kenta Kon, marking the automaker's second CEO transition in three years.The leadership shakeup will take effect on April 1, with Sato assuming the position of vice chairman and a newly created role as chief industry officer. \"Under this new leadership structure, Sato will focus on the broader industry, including Toyota, as Vice Chairman and CIO, while Kon will focus on internal company management as President and CEO,\" the company said in a statement. In a press briefing following the announcement, Kon likened the switch to Sato becoming \"captain of the national team\" and Kon the \"club captain.\" Sato explained the change was made so he could focus on leveraging his new roles as chairman of the Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association and as vice chair of Keidanren, Japan's most influential business lobby. Sato had been appointed CEO in 2023, succeeding longtime leader Akio Toyoda. Executive Vice President Yoichi Miyazaki will assume Kon's former position as CFO. Meanwhile, Toyota plans to make further board changes in June 2026, with Kon joining as a director and Sato resigning from the board.Profit outlook raisedToyota added that the leadership changes will help speed up decision-making amid industry challenges and accelerate its transformation into a more diversified mobility company.Sales revenue for the December quarter rose 8.6% from a year earlier to 13.46 trillion yen ($85.8 billion), beating LSEG SmartEstimates by about 10%. The estimates are weighted toward forecasts from analysts with stronger historical accuracy.Operating income fell 2% to 1.19 trillion yen, reflecting continued pressure from U.S. tariffs. The result still topped LSEG's mean estimate of 1.09 trillion yen.Shares were trading up 1.5% on Friday following the news.Toyota has been increasing its focus on electrified vehicles, including EVs and hybrids, amid tough global competition.The company said Friday that electrified vehicles accounted for nearly half of its retail vehicle sales in the first three quarters of its fiscal year. Sales were driven by strong demand for hybrid vehicles in regions such as North America and China.Toyota raised its full-year operating profit forecast by 11.8%, citing a weak yen and cost reductions to help offset the impact of U.S. tariffs.",

    "body": "Newly appointed Reserve Bank of India Governor Sanjay Malhotra after addressing a press conference, in Mumbai on Dec. 11, 2024.Indranil Mukherjee | Afp | Getty ImagesIndia's central bank on Friday kept its policy rates steady, as trade deals with the E.U. and the U.S. are set to support the world's fastest growing large economy. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the policy rate to remain unchanged at 5.25%. \"External headwinds have intensified, though the successful completion of trade deals augurs well\" for overall economic outlook, said Sanjay Malhotra, governor of Reserve Bank of India, explaining the reason for hitting a pause on the easing cycle.He added that in the near term, domestic inflation and growth outlook remain positive.\"Guidance was balanced, suggesting a prolonged pause is likely going forward,\" said Radhika Rao, senior economist and executive director at DBS Bank Singapore in an emailed response.The Reserve Bank of India cut benchmark rates by 125 basis points last year, and economists say the focus will now shift to transmission of the previous rate cuts.  Malhotra said the RBI \"will remain proactive in liquidity management\" and ensure sufficient liquidity in the banking system \"to meet the productive requirements of the economy\" and to facilitate monetary policy transmission.\"We expect open market operations this quarter and the next,\" Rao of DBS Bank said.watch nowThe RBI will likely hold rates for at least a year, Santanu Sengupta, chief India economist at Goldman Sachs, told CNBC's \"Inside India.\" There was an \"outside chance of a rate cut,\" if the U.S.-India trade deal had not gone through, he added.Earlier this week, U.S. President Donald Trump announced that Washington will cut tariffs on Indian exports to 18%, dispelling the central bank's worries around external headwinds to growth it had flagged in the last policy meet. The U.S. had levied 50% tariffs on India, amongst the highest across countries and more than on China with which it has had an adversarial relationship, souring ties between New Delhi and Washington.The RBI will focus on transmission of rates as the yields on long-term bonds are \"unlikely to come off,\" said Sengupta, as banks and insurance companies taper their buying of long-term government securities coupled while the supply of bonds is rising.India will borrow 17.2 trillion rupees ($187 billion) in the financial year starting April 1, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said in her budget speech on Sunday. This figure marks an increase of 18% from the revised estimate for financial year 2026 and was higher than market estimates.In its December policy meet, the RBI cut interest rates by 25 basis points to 5.25% in a unanimous decision, citing \"weakness in some key economic indicators.\"According to India's economic survey, released just days before the U.S.-India deal announcement, the country's economy is expected to grow by 7.4% in the fiscal year ending March 2026, and between 6.8% and 7.2% the following year. That puts India on track to keeping its crown of being the world's fastest growing large economy.The RBI has little to worry on the inflation front too. India's consumer inflation rose to 1.33% in December, slightly accelerating from 0.71% in the prior month. The central bank expects inflation for the current financial year at 2.1%, up from 2.0% forecast earlier. The food supply prospects \"remain bright\" in the near term, the RBI said in a release, adding that even core inflation was expected to remain in range, excluding volatility caused by prices of precious metals.",

    "body": "Goldman Sachs has been working with the artificial intelligence startup Anthropic to create AI agents to automate a growing number of roles within the bank, the firm's tech chief told CNBC exclusively.The bank has, for the past six months, been working with embedded Anthropic engineers to co-develop autonomous agents in at least two specific areas: accounting for trades and transactions, and client vetting and onboarding, according to Marco Argenti, Goldman's chief information officer.The firm is \"in the early stages\" of developing agents based on Anthropic's Claude model that will collapse the amount of time these essential functions take, Argenti said. He expects to launch the agents \"soon,\" though he declined to provide a specific date.\"Think of it as a digital co-worker for many of the professions within the firm that are scaled, are complex and very process intensive,\" he said.Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon said in October that his bank was embarking on a multiyear plan to reorganize itself around generative AI, the technology that has made waves since the arrival of OpenAI's ChatGPT in late 2022. Even as investment banks like Goldman are experiencing surging revenue from trading and advisory activities, it will seek to \"constrain headcount growth\" amid the overhaul, Solomon said.The news from Goldman comes as model updates from Anthropic, co-founded by a former OpenAI executive, have sparked a sharp sell-off among software firms and their credit providers as investors wager on who the winners and losers from the AI trade will be.watch nowGoldman began last year by testing an autonomous AI coder called Devin, which is now broadly available to the bank's engineers. But it quickly found that Anthropic's AI model could work in other parts of the bank, Argenti said. \"Claude is really good at coding,\" Argenti said. \"Is that because coding is kind of special, or is it about the model's ability to reason through complex problems, step-by-step, applying logic?\"Argenti said the firm was \"surprised\" at how capable Claude was at tasks besides coding, especially in areas like accounting and compliance that combine the need to parse large amounts of data and documents while applying rules and judgment, he said.Now, the view within Goldman is that \"there are these other areas of the firm where we could expect the same level of automation and the same level of results that we're seeing on the coding side,\" he said.The upshot is that, with the help of the agents in development, clients will be onboarded faster and issues with trade reconciliation or other accounting matters will be solved faster, Argenti said.Goldman could next develop agents for tasks like employee surveillance or making investment banking pitchbooks, he said. While the bank employs thousands of people in the compliance and accounting functions where AI agents will soon operate, Argenti said that it was \"premature\" to expect that the technology will lead to job losses for those workers.Still, Goldman could cut out third-party providers it uses today as AI technology matures, he said.\"It's always a trade-off,\" Argenti said. \"Our philosophy right now is that we're injecting capacity, which in most cases will allow us to do things faster, which translates to a better client experience and more business.\"",

    "body": "Andy Jassy, CEO of Amazon, speaks during an unveiling event in New York, Feb. 26, 2025.Michael Nagle | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesAmazon's stock plunged 11% in extended trading Thursday, dragged lower by market jitters around the company's $200 billion capex plans, the highest spending forecast among the megacap companies. The forecast is a sharp increase from Amazon's capital expenditures last year, and it was more than $50 billion above analysts' expectations. The company reported spending roughly $131 billion on purchases of property and equipment in 2025, up from about $83 billion in the year prior.  Tech companies have laid out aggressive spending plans on artificial intelligence infrastructure since OpenAI ushered in the modern era of this technology with the release of ChatGPT in late 2022, but at the start of 2026, those lavish commitments have only kept growing. Google parent Alphabet on Wednesday said it would spend up to $185 billion in 2026, while Meta last week said its capital expenditures could nearly double from last year to somewhere between $115 billion and $135 billion in 2026On a conference call with investors, Wall Street analysts pressed Amazon executives for more clarity around the spending blitz and when it could begin to pay off. CEO Andy Jassy said in prepared remarks at the beginning of the call that he was \"confident\" that company's cloud unit will see a \"strong return on invested capital,\" though he didn't say when it could materialize.\"Help us, get to that — get to your level of confidence in having a strong long-term return on that invested capital,\" Mark Mahaney, Evercore ISI head of internet research, said to Jassy. Jassy said the company needs the capital to keep pace with \"very high demand\" for Amazon's AI compute, which requires more infrastructure such as data centers, chips and networking equipment.\"This isn't some sort of quixotic, top-line grab,\" Jassy said. \"We have confidence that we, that these investments will yield strong returns on invested capital. We've done that with our core AWS business. I think that will very much be true here as well.\"Sales at Amazon Web Services grew 24% to $35.6 billion in the most recent period, beating analysts' expectations and marking the cloud unit's \"fastest growth in 13 quarters,\" Jassy said. AWS could've grown faster if it had more capacity to meet demand, \"so we are being incredibly scrappy around that,\" he said. The company's cloud unit added almost 4 gigawatts of computing capacity in 2025, and AWS expects to double that power by the end of 2027, Jassy noted.Barclays analyst Ross Sandler asked Jassy how he sees the AI market evolving from the current landscape, where it remains \"a bit top-heavy with a lot of the spend clustering around a few of the AI-native labs.\"Jassy said the AI market has become more like a \"barbell,\" with the AI labs on one side and enterprises on the other end, looking to the technology as a \"productivity and cost avoidance\" tool. The middle is comprised of enterprises that are in various stages of building AI applications, he said. \"That middle part of the barbell very well may end up being the largest and most durable,\" Jassy said.

    "body": "Sopa Images | Lightrocket | Getty ImagesReddit shares rose 5% in after-hours trading Thursday after the company reported fourth-quarter earnings that beat on the top and bottom lines and gave strong guidance for the start of 2026.Here's how the company did compared with LSEG estimates:Earnings per share: $1.24 vs. 94 cents expectedRevenue: $726 million vs. $665 million expectedThe company said it expects first-quarter sales to come in the range of $595 million to $605 million, which is higher than Wall Street expectations of $577 million. Adjusted earnings in the first quarter are projected to come in between $210 million and $220 million, ahead of StreetAccount's estimates of $203 million.Reddit also announced a $1 billion share repurchase program.The company's fourth-quarter revenue rose 70% year over year, while net income was $252 million, up nearly 255% from the same period a year ago.Reddit's sales in the U.S. market came in at $583 million in the fourth quarter, topping analyst estimates of $529 million.The company's global daily active uniques, or DAUq, grew 19% year over year to 121.4 million in the fourth quarter, ahead of the 120 million that Wall Street was expecting.Fourth-quarter U.S. DAUq grew 9% year over year to 52.5 million, slightly ahead of the 52.3 million that analysts were projecting.The company said that logged-in DAUq for the U.S., which refers to users who have registered for Reddit accounts, rose 5% year over year to 23 million. That was slower than the 7% year over year growth Reddit said it recorded during the third quarter when its logged-in DAUq for the U.S. came in at 23.1 million. This is the sixth straight quarter in which Reddit's U.S. logged-in user growth has slowed.Investors have been monitoring Reddit's logged-in DAUq metric because users who have created accounts are more lucrative to the company's online advertising business. These Reddit account holders generally use the platform and engage with other users more frequently than those who may have stumbled into Reddit via Google search, which the company refers to as logged-out DAUq.In an investor letter, Reddit CEO Steve Huffman said the company plans to \"phase out reporting on logged-in and logged-out later this year\" because there's now less of a distinction between the two metrics than in the past. That's because the company has been working on features intended to keep both logged-in users and logged-out users glued to the platform, Huffman said.\"As the industry evolves, how we think about our product and users must evolve too,\" Huffman wrote. \"We've historically reported logged-in vs. logged-out users, but as some of our work to streamline onboarding — instant personalization, for example — blurs the line between these states, the distinction between them makes less sense.\"Reddit finance chief Drew Vollero told analysts during an earnings call that the company will continue to report both metrics for the first two quarters of 2026.Regarding the company's data-licensing deals with Google and OpenAI, Huffman said during the earnings call that \"relationships with both companies are very healthy\" and that \"the conversation is shifting from a purely business deal to more of a product partnership.\"\"Specifically, what we're looking for in any relationship like this is can we bring users into the community parts of Reddit,\"  Huffman said. Regarding Reddit's efforts to unify its traditional search tool with its more recent generative AI search feature, Huffman said that the company has learned that \"the GenAI search results will just be better for most queries.\"Unlike traditional search, cutting-edge GenAI search and chat tools excel at providing results that contain \"multiple perspectives from lots of people,\" he said.WATCH: Snap CEO Evan Spiegel discusses social media and well-being.watch now",

    "body": "Two armed members of Iran's police special forces stand behind a country flag placed on an armored military vehicle during a pro-Government rally in downtown Tehran, Iran, on January 12, 2026. Nurphoto | Nurphoto | Getty ImagesThe U.S. Virtual Embassy in Iran issued a security alert early Friday urging American citizens to \"leave Iran now\" and prepare departure plans that don't rely on U.S. government assistance. The notice comes ahead of U.S. and Iran's scheduled talks in Oman on Friday, with little indication that the two sides have found common ground over the agenda of the meeting.  U.S. Special Envoy Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, U.S. President Donald Trump's son-in-law, were due to take part in the meeting with a team led by Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, according to American and Iranian officials.  The U.S. has issued several similar security alerts over the past month. The Embassy last urged American citizens to leave the country in a warning on Jan. 14 as Trump was weighing options for a possible intervention in Iran, including targeted military strikes.The talks on Friday would be the first official meeting between Tehran and Washington since tensions flared in June last year, when a 12-day war with Israel led to U.S. airstrikes that severely damaged Iran’s three main nuclear facilities.  Differences over the scope and venue for the talks have cast doubts on whether they will yield results, keeping open the risk of a U.S. military action.  The U.S. government has reportedly demanded Iran to discard its stockpile of enriched uranium, put limits on Tehran's ballistic missile program and stop arming and funding militant groups in the Middle East. Trump has threatened military strikes against Tehran if it fails to agree to U.S. demands. Iran has pushed back, saying U.S. demands are an unacceptable infringement on its sovereignty and has threatened to respond forcefully to any attacks by striking U.S. military targets in the region and Israel.Little hope?The diplomatic moves come against the backdrop of heightened tensions in the Middle East with the U.S. building up forces in the Gulf in recent weeks. Trump has sent what he called a \"massive armada,\" led by aircraft carrier Abraham Lincoln to the Middle East in the lead up to the talks. The odds for a deal or de-escalation from the talks are low, as the core demands of both sides remain \"far apart and there is zero trust,\" said Bob McNally, president at Rapidan Energy Group. McNally projected a 75% probability that the U.S. and Iran will engage in military hostilities in the coming days, or weeks. Possible scenarios include a Venezuela-style blockade, selective or limited strikes and large-scale military conflict, he said.The talks were originally slated to take place in Istanbul, given Turkey's leading role as a mediator, with foreign ministers from regional Arab countries, including Egypt, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and Turkey, invited to participate.But on Tuesday, Tehran requested a last-minute change of venue and format, asking the meeting to be held in Oman and to limit attendees to Iranian and American representatives. watch nowAs Trump has put U.S. credibility on the line, if Iran refuses to make large concessions, the U.S, president will likely feel compelled to act, McNally said. On the other hand, if the U.S. stands down from attacks, Israel could launch strikes against Iranian missile, nuclear and regime leadership targets. Tensions flared up earlier this year after a nationwide protest broke out in Iran. Tehran clamped down on protests, killing at least 6,883 people as of Wednesday, according to Human Rights Activists News Agency, a Washington-based group focused on Iran. Trump had previously threatened to intervene in support of protestors in the country, but ultimately backed out of taking military action.— CNBC's Asriel Chua contributed to the report. ",

Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., will ask the Senate on Thursday to condemn and call for the reversal of the sale of 500,000 advanced artificial intelligence chips to the United Arab Emirates. Warren's resolution, shared exclusively with CNBC, comes after a report in The Wall Street Journal last week that Sheikh Tahnoon bin Zayed Al Nahyan of the United Arab Emirates, also known as the \"Spy Sheikh,\" purchased a secret 49% stake in the Trump family’s World Liberty Financial days before President Donald Trump's inauguration. The stake reportedly saw roughly $187 million flow to Trump family entities.The chip deal came just months after Tahnoon's purchase in World Liberty Financial, prompting allegations of bribery. Prior U.S. administrations have warned against selling chips to the UAE, citing concern that they will fall into the hands of China. Tahnoon's own AI enterprise, G42, will receive chips as part of the deal. \"Why in the world was Donald Trump trying to ship off our state-of-the-art chips to the UAE — and China — when American startups, universities, and small businesses need them here at home?\" Warren is expected to ask on the floor when she introduces her resolution. A draft of it has been viewed by CNBC. \"Well, now we know that the UAE greased the skids months earlier when it secretly agreed to pour hundreds of millions of dollars into a Trump family crypto venture just four days before President Trump's inauguration.\"President Donald Trump shakes hands with Tahnoun bin Zayed Al Nahyan, National Security Advisor of UAE, next to UAE President Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, left, after arriving on Air Force One at Abu Dhabi International Airport, Thursday, May 15, 2025, in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates.Alex Brandon | APIf agreed to on the Senate floor, the resolution would resolve that the Senate \"Condemns Donald Trump's decision to allow the sale of advanced AI chips to the United Arab Emirates and calls for the reversal of this decision.\"The chip deal would send 500,000 of Nvidia's chips to the UAE annually, including the most advanced silicon the U.S. company makes.

We cannot allow American national security to be sold to the highest bidder,\" she's expected to add. The Trump administration has denied wrongdoing related to Tahnoon's purchase and the chip deal.

I'm not going to legitimize their actions,\" Slotkin said in a videotaped statement she posted on X.Slotkin's lawyer also sent letters to Attorney General Pam Bondi and U.S. Attorney for Washington, D.C., Jeanine Pirro, informing them of her noncompliance, and asking Bondi to order Pirro to drop the probe.The lawyer, Preet Bharara, urged Pirro to retain her records because of \"anticipated litigation concerning potential violations of the Senator's First Amendment rights and your office's vindictive and retaliatory investigation.\"Bharara, in a letter to Pirro, said that the message of the Nov. 18 video featuring Slotkin and the other Democrats \"is uncontroversial and incontrovertible.\"\"It is therefore perplexing that the Department of Justice has begun an inquiry into the matter. For the reasons set forth below, our client will not submit to an interview in these circumstances and on this record,\" wrote Bharara, who previously served as U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York.Pirro's office declined to comment on the letters. CNBC has requested comment from the DOJ.Slotkin, in her video on X on Thursday, said that the Trump administration's aggressive reaction to her original video to U.S. troops resulted in a torrent of threats against her, her family, and her staff.\"To be honest, many lawyers told me to just be quiet, keep my head down, and hopefully this will all just go away,\" she said.\"But that's exactly what the Trump administration and Jeanine Pirro want.\"\"They are purposely using physical and legal intimidation to get me to shut up. But more importantly, they're using that intimidation to deter others from speaking out against their administration,\" Slotkin said. \"The intimidation is the point, and I'm not gonna go along with that,\" she said.In the Nov. 18 video, titled \"Don't give up the ship,\" the former CIA officer Slotkin and the other lawmakers deliver a straight-to-camera address to members of the U.S. military.\"Our laws are clear: You can refuse illegal orders,\" Slotkin said on that video.The others in the video were Sen.

The boat attacks — whose legality has been questioned — have resulted in at least 126 deaths since early September, according to The New York Times.President Donald Trump raged against the video, accusing the Democrats who appeared on it of sedition and treason, while calling for their arrest. \"Their words cannot be allowed to stand — We won't have a Country anymore!!!\" Trump wrote on Truth Social on Nov. 20. \"An example MUST BE SET.\"In a subsequent post, he wrote: \"SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR, punishable by DEATH!\"Days later, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth echoed Trump, calling the video \"despicable, reckless, and false\" and labeling the Democrats the \"Seditious Six.\" The Pentagon initially said it was reviewing \"serious allegations of misconduct\" against Kelly, and then later moved to cut his military retirement pay in retaliation for the video.The lawmakers in late November said that the FBI sought to interview them. Kelly filed a federal civil lawsuit against Hegseth and the Pentagon on Jan. 12 over his punishment for the video.On the same day, Slotkin told the Times that Pirro's office sent the Senate's sergeant-at-arms a request to interview either her or her private counsel.In a court hearing Tuesday, U.S. District Judge Richard Leon expressed skepticism about the Pentagon's attempt to censure Kelly over his involvement in the video.

Analysts expected 138 million DAUs.Roblox announced in its letter to shareholders that it no longer plans to issue annual guidance starting in 2027 due to \"inherent variability\" in the company's business. Instead, Roblox said it will focus on providing quarterly guidance. Roblox has faced criticism for putting underage users at risk, with multiple lawsuits on behalf of children who were sexually exploited on the gaming platform.The company said that late in the fourth quarter it began a mandatory age check for users looking to access communication features in Australia, New Zealand and the Netherlands. Roblox said 60% of its daily users in those markets had age checked while 45% of global daily users had done so.Roblox said the age-check rollout, which was completed globally in January, has caused \"a mid-single-digit headwind to engagement growth and a low-single-digit headwind to bookings growth.\" But the company added that \"the strategic upside is significant.\"\"Accurate age data unlocks a long-term opportunity to tailor features and content, increasing safety and civility, which in turn drives organic engagement growth,\" the company wrote.Roblox said it has found that the age checking has revealed its user base is younger than indicated by self-reported data. Among daily users, 38% are between the ages of 13 and 17, 35% are under the age of 13 and 27% are over 18. The company said it views its scale with young users as a \"valuable strategic asset.\"WATCH: Gaming stocks plunge on news of Google AI gaming toolwatch now",

    "body": "watch nowAmazon shares sunk more than 9% on Friday after the company's hefty spending forecast surprised investors who were already wary that the artificial intelligence boom is at risk of becoming a bubble. The e-commerce company on Thursday was the latest tech giant to announce plans for a massive increase in capital expenditures, after Google parent Alphabet, Microsoft and Meta all signaled they expect their spending sprees to continue. Amazon, Alphabet, Microsoft and Meta reported about $120 billion in capital expenditures in the fourth quarter alone. That figure could exceed more than $660 billion this year, the Financial Times reported, which is higher than the gross domestic product of countries like the United Arab Emirates, Singapore and Israel.Wall Street has responded differently to the companies' spending plans, cheering Meta and Alphabet's forecasts, while punishing Amazon and Microsoft. Amazon, Microsoft, Nvidia, Meta, Google and Oracle collectively shed more than $1 trillion from their valuations over the past week, according to FactSet data. Shares of companies developing hardware for the AI build-out will likely face continued volatility as \"sentiment contagion takes hold,\" Paul Markham, investment director at GAM Investments, told CNBC.\"Questions over the extent of capex as a result of LLM build-outs, the eventual return on that, and the fear of eventual over-expansion of capacity will be persistent,\" he added.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconAmazon shares over the past month'Investors questioning every angle in AI race'Amazon announced in its fourth-quarter earnings report that its capital expenditures are expected to reach $200 billion in 2026, which was more than $50 billion above analysts' expectations. While management is confident of long-term returns on investment, the lack of visibility is not sitting well with investors, Mamta Valechha, consumer discretionary analyst at Quilter Cheviot, said Friday morning.\"We have suddenly gone from the fear that you cannot be last, to investors questioning every single angle in this AI race.\"Analysts at D.A. Davidson downgraded Amazon's stock on Friday to neutral from a buy rating over concerns around its spending plans, risks to its cloud dominance and the potential for AI to erode its retail business. \"With the context of results from Microsoft and Google, we see AWS continuing to lose its lead and now scrambling to catch up through escalating investment,\" the analysts wrote in a research note. \"We are also increasingly concerned about Amazon retail's transition to a new chat-driven internet dominated by Gemini and ChatGPT.\"Apple, on the other hand, which has faced pressure from Wall Street over its AI strategy and has previously committed far less on capex than other Big Tech firms, has seen its stock jump 7% since Monday on the back of what CEO Tim Cook described as \"staggering\" demand for the iPhone. \"The bet is becoming binary,\" Michael Field, chief equity strategist at Morningstar, told CNBC, referring to the huge investments in so-called Magnificent Seven companies. \"Either a big pay off if these investments come good, or a huge waste of shareholder's cash if it goes wrong.\"— CNBC's Annie Palmer and Elsa Ohlen also contributed to this report.",

    "body": "Uber signs are seen on cars in Krakow, Poland on October 12, 2025. Jakub Porzycki | Nurphoto | Getty ImagesUber on Thursday was ordered to pay $8.5 million to the plaintiff in an Arizona trial that is the first of thousands of lawsuits involving alleged sexual assault and misconduct by drivers on the ridesharing platform.In the lawsuit, Jaylynn Dean alleged that she was raped by her Uber driver in November 2023 while returning to her hotel.  The verdict, which was delivered in a U.S. District Court in Phoenix, found Uber liable for apparent agency and lays the groundwork for about 3,000 similar lawsuits nationwide that have been consolidated in federal court. The jury did not find Uber liable for negligence or design defects and the company was not ordered to pay punitive damages.\"This verdict affirms that Uber acted responsibly and has invested meaningfully in rider safety. We will continue to put safety at the heart of everything we do,\" a spokesperson for Uber wrote in a statement to CNBC.Sarah London, a lawyer at Girard Sharp who is representing Dean, called the verdict a \"victory\" for the plaintiff in a statement to CNBC and said it \"validates the thousands of survivors who have come forward at great personal risk to demand accountability against Uber for its focus on profit over passenger safety.\"The company is planning to appeal the decision.The ride-hailing company has said it should not be held liable for the misconduct of drivers, who are classified as contractors on its platform. Last year, the New York Times reported that Uber received over 400,000 sexual assault and misconduct reports between 2017 and 2022, which was far more than the company had disclosed. In a report last August, Uber said serious sexual assault on the platform had fallen by 44%.Uber has taken steps to address safety on the platform and implemented new features, including an in-app emergency button and pin verification. In July, Uber began piloting a program in the U.S. that allows women drivers and riders to opt out of being paired with a man. Ridesharing rival Lyft has also faced lawsuits tied to sexual assault and harassment. watch nowRead more CNBC tech newsAlphabet resets the bar for AI infrastructure spendingSoftware experiencing 'most exciting moment' as AI fears hammer the stocksSnap shares rise on fourth-quarter earnings that beat on salesQualcomm stock sinks as memory shortage drags on forecast",

    "body": "Indian Minister of Commerce and Industry, Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution and Textiles Shri Piyush Goyal is talking to media on EU-India trade relations. India will waive tariffs on industrial imports from four European nations for a $100 billion investment over 15 years, ending nearly 16 years of negotiations.Thierry Monasse | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesNew Delhi is ready to place orders worth up to $80 billion for Boeing planes, India's commerce and industry minister, Piyush Goyal, reportedly said, signaling the country's willingness to expand trade with the U.S.India's demand for aircraft alone, with orders for Boeing \"yet to be placed but ready,\" is nearly $80 billion, Goyal said Thursday, adding that if engines and other spare parts are added, imports from U.S. will \"cross $100 billion just [from] aircrafts.\"Families of passengers who died in the Air India plane crash in Ahmedabad in June of last year are suing Boeing, over the alleged role of defective dual switches in the disaster that saw 241 of the 242, the minister said, on board lose their lives.The minister also said that there was potential to procure a minimum of $500 billion worth of goods from the U.S. over the next five years, but clarified that there was no explicit investment commitment made as part of the trade deal with Washington.On Monday, within a week of the India-European Union trade deal, U.S. President Donald Trump announced in a social media post that Washington and New Delhi had agreed a trade deal. Trump said that the U.S. will reduce tariffs on Indian goods to 18%, while New Delhi will lower duties on U.S. goods to zero, replace Russian oil with supply from U.S. and Venezuela, open sensitive markets such as agriculture, and buy $500 billion worth of American goods.The Indian prime minister expressed delight over the cut in duties, as goods from the country entering the U.S. have been subjected to 50% tariffs, but did not acknowledge any other details shared by Trump.watch nowWhile experts agree that India will buy more from the U.S., they have said the target of buying goods worth $500 billion from Washington \"seems a stretch.\"India's overall goods imports stood at $720.24 billion in financial year 2025, with its trade deficit at $94.3 billion. That includes goods worth $45.3 billion from the U.S.Deal timelineIndia and the U.S. will sign a joint statement in the next three to four days, finalizing the first tranche of the trade deal between the two countries, Goyal said on Thursday. The 18% tariffs on Indian exports to the U.S. will become effective after the joint statement is issued, he added.The two sides will then sign a formal agreement in mid-March, after which the tariff concession for U.S. goods entering India will become effective.Since the deal has been announced, the Indian government has been scant with details and is facing questions from opposition political parties. The leader of India's opposition, Rahul Gandhi, has accused Modi of being \"compromised\" and of having \"surrendered on Tariffs.The Indian government has not confirmed some of Trump's claims about the trade deal such as India reducing duties on U.S. goods to zero and halting imports of Russian oil, as well as a firm commitment to purchasing goods worth $500 billion.Experts say Trump's claims seem \"unrealistic\" and risk the U.S. backtracking on the trade deal, citing his threats to raise tariffs on South Korea, after slashing them in July last year, despite a trade deal.",

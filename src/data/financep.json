    "body": "Cambridge Dictionary named \"parasocial\" as Word of the Year for 2025.Francesco Carta Fotografo | Moment | Getty ImagesAI chatbots, Taylor Swift, and social media influencers all played a part in deciding Cambridge Dictionary's Word of the Year, 2025: \"parasocial.\" Parasocial — revealed by the global dictionary on Tuesday as its word of the year — refers to the connection a person feels to an online personality ranging from celebrities to podcasters, and even artificial intelligence. \"Parasocial relationship is when we think we know someone, or we feel very close to someone who's in fact, a person we've never met, like a celebrity, an influencer, or somebody in public life who's famous for some reason,\" Simone Schnall, professor of experimental social psychology at the University of Cambridge, told CNBC Make It. \"In reality, of course, it's only a one-sided, so-called relationship,\" she added. The term originated in 1956 when University of Chicago sociologists Donald Horton and Richard Wohl found that people who watched television were treating the actors on-screen like friends or family. Schnall explained that the \"phenomenon\" is well-known in our culture, but it's only now that people are using the term more commonly. \"It's been there forever, but I think in our culture, we now see parasocials on steroids, simply because there are so many opportunities for it. There are so many people who, for whatever reason, we can be interested in and fascinated by, inspired by,\" she said. One example is singer and billionaire Taylor Swift who has an intense global fanbase due to her relatable songs. Many of her fan report having a deep, emotional connection with her and keep up with her personal life and romantic relationships. Other examples include social media influencer and Youtuber Logan Paul who has around 27 million followers on Instagram and 23 million subscribers on YouTube. In 2018, Paul posted a video showing a deceased person in Japan's Aokigahara \"suicide forest,\" sparking global outrage. Many of his die‑hard fans defended him, showing fierce loyalty despite the seriousness of the content. Paul later apologized for the video. Schnall warned there are \"dangers\" in following celebrities and social media influencers who might share incorrect medical advice, sell bad products, or promote unethical behaviour.  \"They [influencers] could do some serious harm to their followers. The people who feel they're in that parasocial relationship, they could really be harmed by that,\" Schnall warned. AI chatbots and loneliness culture Cambridge Dictionary referenced that part of the increasing popularity of the word \"parasocial\" stems from relationships being formed with AI chatbots. A 2025 report by Common Sense Media, which surveyed 1,060 U.S. teens, found that 72% of teenagers aged 13 to 17 had used an AI companion at least once. This was for a range of reasons from emotional or mental health support or as a friend or best friend. \"They're called chatbots because we feel like we're chatting with someone already,\" Schnall said. \"People can develop certain relationships, like a friendship or even romantic relationship, or at least, that's how they feel about it, when of course in reality, there is no one else involved.\" And it's not just teens. A recent survey by Vantage Point Counselling of over 1,000 American adults found that 28% said they have had a romantic or intimate relationship with an AI. Schnall offered two reasons why people are turning to parasocial relationships: a global loneliness epidemic and increased screentime. On phones and screens, parasocial relationships are \"just a click away\" so it's easier to get immediate social approval. Meanwhile, chatbots are designed to flatter you, per Schnall. \"People tend to be more lonely than in previous generations, and they spend so much time on their screens where these parasocial relationships are very easy to establish,\" she said.The antidote, Schnall said is investing in real-life relationships because the more time you spend online, the less time you spend pursuing in-person connections. \"The more time I spend chatting with a chatbot, the less time I probably spent chatting with a real life person,\" she added.

    "body": "The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics is the principal Federal agency responsible for measuring labor market activity, working conditions, and price changes in the economy.Bill Clark | Getty ImagesThe Bureau of Labor Statistics said it was canceling the release of the October consumer price index, leaving the Federal Reserve without a key piece of inflation data to ponder when it next decides on interest rates on Dec. 10.The CPI data, previously scheduled to be released on Nov. 7, was canceled because the government shutdown made it impossible for the BLS to \"retroactively collect\" certain parts of survey data, the agency said on its website.November's CPI data, previously scheduled to be released on Dec. 10, will now be released on Dec. 18 after the Fed decision, the BLS said.Bureau data collectors compile the index through several methods, including personal visits and phone calls that were not possible during the shutdown. The BLS also uses online data and household surveys that also would make it difficult to retroactively collect information. In addition to the Fed announcement, the Commerce Department's Bureau of Economic Analysis said another key inflation measure, the personal consumption expenditures price index, \"is to be rescheduled\" though no firm date has been announced. The Fed uses the PCE price index as its main inflation forecasting tool. The gauge had been set for release Nov. 26.Fed officials have voiced concerns about being in a data fog as they try to formulate monetary policy. The central bank's Federal Open Market Committee approved a quarter percentage point rate cut in late October, but minutes from the meeting reflected worries over getting an incomplete picture.\"This is a temporary state of affairs. And we're going to do our jobs, we're going to collect every scrap of data we can find, evaluate it, and think carefully about it,\" Fed Chair Jerome Powell said after the October meeting. \"What do you do if you're driving in the fog? You slow down. ... There's a possibility that it would make sense to be more cautious about moving.\"However, New York Fed President John Williams said Friday he thinks the Fed probably has \"room for a further adjustment in the near term,\" implying the likelihood of a cut sometime soon.Other Fed officials, such as Governor Christopher Waller, have said policymakers still have enough information to make informed decisions, even with the data drought from the shutdown.",

    "body": "Startup Figure AI is developing general-purpose humanoid robots.Figure AIFigure AI, an Nvidia-backed developer of humanoid robots, was sued by the startup's former head of product safety who alleged that he was wrongfully terminated after warning top executives that the company's robots \"were powerful enough to fracture a human skull.\"Robert Gruendel, a principal robotic safety engineer, is the plaintiff in the suit filed Friday in a federal court in the Northern District of California. Gruendel's attorneys describe their client as a whistleblower who was fired in September, days after lodging his \"most direct and documented safety complaints.\"The suit lands two months after Figure was valued at $39 billion in a funding round led by Parkway Venture Capital. That's a 15-fold increase in valuation from early 2024, when the company raised a round from investors including Jeff Bezos, Nvidia, and Microsoft.In the complaint, Gruendel's lawyers say the plaintiff warned Figure CEO Brett Adcock and Kyle Edelberg, chief engineer, about the robot's lethal capabilities, and said one \"had already carved a ¼-inch gash into a steel refrigerator door during a malfunction.\"The complaint also says Gruendel warned company leaders not to \"downgrade\" a \"safety road map\" that he had been asked to present to two prospective investors who ended up funding the company.Gruendel worried that a \"product safety plan which contributed to their decision to invest\" had been \"gutted\" the same month Figure closed the investment round, a move that \"could be interpreted as fraudulent,\" the suit says. The plaintiff's concerns were \"treated as obstacles, not obligations,\" and the company cited a \"vague 'change in business direction' as the pretext\" for his termination, according to the suit.Gruendel is seeking economic, compensatory and punitive damages and demanding a jury trial.A Figure spokesperson said in an emailed statement that Gruendel was \"terminated for poor performance,\" and that his \"allegations are falsehoods that Figure will thoroughly discredit in court.\"Robert Ottinger, Gruendel's attorney, told CNBC in a statement that, \"California law protects employees who report unsafe practices.\" \"This case involves important and emerging issues, and may be among the first whistleblower cases related to the safety of humanoid robots,\" Ottinger said. \"Mr. Gruendel looks forward to the judicial process exposing the clear danger this rush to market approach presents to the public.\"The humanoid robot market remains nascent today, with companies like Tesla and Boston Dynamics pursuing futuristic offerings, alongside Figure, while China's Unitree Robotics is preparing for an IPO. Morgan Stanley said in a report in May that adoption is \"likely to accelerate in the 2030s\" and could top $5 trillion by 2050.Read the filing here:watch now",

    "body": "Bitcoin fell sharply after a sell-off of major U.S. stock indices. Bitcoin has been correlated closely to the price movement of the Nasdaq index.Luke MacGregor  | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesBitcoin tumbled as much as 6% early Friday, hovering just above its critical $80,000 support level at one point, as investors continued their flight from risk-on assets to more defensive plays. The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization hit $80,548 at around 7:30 a.m. ET. The token's plunge to that price — its lowest since April 11— marks a steepening of bitcoin's decline following widespread cascading liquidations of highly leveraged crypto positions in October. \"Price action has been unimpressive across the large tokens, BTC dipping below the year-start price as long-time and larger holders of the token have become more active,\" Citi analyst Alex Saunders said Friday in a note to clients. \"ETF flows, the main driver of BTC prices, are also drying up, adding to the short-term performance worries.\"Bitcoin has since regained some of its losses to trade down 4% to $82,939.59, according to Coin Metrics. The cryptocurrency has fallen 12% since the beginning of the week and roughly 26% over the last month.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconBitcoin value year to dateThe token's slide follows mounting pressure in the U.S. stock market, which has led investors to rotate out of volatile assets like crypto and artificial intelligence stocks into safe-havens such as gold. The Nasdaq Composite fell 2% on Thursday, as a rally sparked by Nvidia's blockbuster earnings on Wednesday lost steam. Its fizzling underscores investors' increasing scrutiny of sky-high AI valuations. Investors in AI also often hold bitcoin, linking the two trades.Cryptocurrency stocks were also in the red. Strategy, a bitcoin treasury firm, has fallen 2% on the day and is now down 42% over the past month. American Bitcoin and Riot Platforms shed 7% and 4% in Thursday's session, respectively.  Bitcoin is now down 9% since the beginning of the year, despite smashing several price records following President Donald Trump's inauguration in January. Amid the administration's pro-crypto policies, it last sailed to a record price just north of $126,000 in early October.  But, it's now more than 30% off that high. \"We're in very oversold territory for bitcoin right now,\" Sebastian Pedro Bea, chief investment officer at crypto asset management firm ReserveOne, told CNBC.",

    "body": "Three years since the arrival of OpenAI's ChatGPT, more devices featuring generative AI technology have hit the market in time for the 2025 holiday shopping season, with many offering deals for Black Friday.Shoppers can pick from more advanced smart glasses, smart speakers with genAI and a pendant AI friend that acts as a confidant.These latest gizmos come from megacaps like Amazon, Alphabet and Meta and smaller players like Friend and Plaud.Despite the arrival of this new wave of products, reviews for many of the devices are mixed, and nothing has separated itself as a clear leader of the pack.That's in part because much of the spending on artificial intelligence has been focused on other things.Since ChatGPT was released in late 2022, the bulk of the tech industry has reoriented itself to prioritize building out large language models in a race to reach artificial general intelligence, or AI with the capabilities that are on par with, or surpass, humans.Thus far, much of the development in Silicon Valley has focused on AI apps, including chatbots like Anthropic's Claude, image generators like Google's Nano Banana or feeds for AI-generated short-form videos like OpenAI's Sora. All things people can access on their existing smartphones without a spiffy new gadget.But the world of AI hardware is growing fast.If you're in the market for the latest AI devices, here's what's available to snag this holiday season.Daniel Rausch, vice president of Alexa and Echo, announces the Echo Studio and Echo Dot Max during an Amazon event showcasing new products in New York City, U.S., September 30, 2025.Kylie Cooper | ReutersAlexa+ Echo speakersAmazon wants to make sure its Alexa voice assistant and Echo smart speakers don't get left behind in the era of genAI. The company unveiled Alexa+ in February, promising a smarter, more conversational and personalized version of its 11-year-old digital assistant. In September, it followed up with a new set of Echo speakers and displays, which are the first devices to come with Alexa+ out of the box. The lineup includes a $100 Echo Dot Max, $180 Echo Show, $220 Echo Studio and $220 Echo Show 11.The Echo Dot Max is an entry-level, all-purpose smart speaker, while the Echo Studio is larger, pricier and offers better sound quality. The main difference between Amazon's smart displays, the Echo Show 8 and Echo Show 11, is the touchscreen size.  All of the devices have improved sensors, speakers and microphones. Amazon is offering 11% off the cost of the Echo Show 11 and 10% off the Echo Dot Max as part of its Black Friday promotions.With the upgrades, Amazon is aiming to have users engage more often with the devices than their predecessors. Consumers frequently complained that Alexa had grown outdated while the Echo devices offered little utility beyond setting timers, spouting weather forecasts, playing music and controlling smart home accessories, like turning lights on and off. Amazon's recent Alexa ad tries to paint a different picture. Comedian Pete Davidson strolls through his kitchen when an Alexa-equipped Echo Show announces, unprompted, that the \"Coffee's on, and your Uber is on its way.\" Davidson then casually banters back and forth with Alexa about his preferred nickname. The interaction is meant to showcase a few of Alexa+'s biggest selling points — users don't have to repeat a so-called \"wake word\" after every command, allowing the conversation to flow more naturally.The devices can also now connect to external services to take actions on users' behalf. As of now, Alexa+ can book an Uber or OpenTable reservation, generate a song via Suno, plan a trip through Fodor's, schedule a repairman visit and purchase concert tickets through Ticketmaster. Amazon has said it expects to add more capabilities soon.Alexa+ isn't yet available to the general public. Consumers have to wait to receive Early Access or purchase a new Echo model to use it. Amazon is offering Alexa+ for free to users with Early Access, but at some point, the company will begin charging non-Prime members $19.99 a month for the service.The company is also making moves in wearables.Amazon in July announced plans to acquire AI company Bee for an undisclosed amount, indicating that it could have more hardware infused with the technology in the works. Bee is known for its $50 wristband that uses AI and microphones to listen to and analyze conversations, then provide to-do lists, summaries and reminders for everyday tasks.-- Annie PalmerA person holds Google Pixel 10, Pixel 10 Pro and Pixel 10 Pro Fold mobile phones during the 'Made by Google' event, organised to introduce the latest additions to Google's Pixel portfolio of devices, in Brooklyn, New York, U.S., August 20, 2025. Brendan McDermid | ReutersGoogle's AI-powered Pixel 10 seriesAlthough the Gemini-powered Google Home Speaker won't roll out until the spring, Alphabet did deliver some generative AI tech this year.Launched in August, the Pixel 10 smartphones thoroughly integrate Google's AI into several features, such as live translation, text-based photo editing and the built-in Gemini assistant.The baseline Pixel 10 starts at $799, while the Pro lineup includes the $999 Pixel 10 Pro, the $1,199 Pixel Pro XL and the $1,799 Pixel 10 Pro Fold. The Pro line offers a higher quality camera and display, as well as additional video features.Among the AI products is \"Magic Cue,\" which connects data across different apps to surface relevant information and suggest helpful actions. For example, if a user receives a message asking about a dinner reservation's location, Magic Cue can find the answer from the calendar app.For snapping pictures, Google provides an AI \"Camera Coach,\" which scans the scene of a photo and offers recommendations about framing, lighting and other techniques to improve the image.The Pixel 10 Pro phones come with a one-year subscription to Google's \"AI Pro\" plan, which typically costs $19 per month and offers multiple AI tools, including writing assistant NotebookLM and video generator Veo 3.All the Pixel 10 models are currently on sale for $200 to $300 off until Dec. 6, except for the Pixel 10 Pro Fold, which has a $300 markdown until Dec. 2, the company said.-- Jaures YipThe Meta Ray-Ban Display AI glasses at Meta headquarters in Menlo Park, California, US, on Tuesday, Sept. 16, 2025. David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesMeta's AI-infused Ray-Ban smart glassesMeta's partnership with eyewear giant EssilorLuxottica, originally inked in 2019, has spawned a surprise hit in the Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses that both companies are keen to boast about.With the Meta AI digital assistant, users can command the camera-equipped glasses to take photos, play tunes and to answer questions about nearby landmarks.In September, the two companies debuted the latest version of the glasses, dubbed Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2). The new model has double the battery life of its predecessor and an improved camera. It costs $379, which is $80 than the prior version.Meta and Luxottica this year also launched two smart glasses aimed at athletes under the Oakley brand.The $399 Oakley Meta HSTN glasses are pitched toward casual athletes who want to take photos while playing sports like golf, while the $499 Oakley Meta Vanguard smart glasses are geared toward the action-sports crowd, like skiers. The Vanguard glasses feature a flashier wraparound design and two buttons on the frames' underside that lets helmet-wearing athletes easily take photos and videos and perform other actions.For those willing to spend big money and test new technology, Meta and Luxottica also rolled out the $799 Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses in September. They are the first glasses Meta sells to the public that include a display, albeit a small one, in just one of the lenses. The display is intended to show users small bits of information, like navigation directions. The glasses also include a wristband that utilizes neural technology so users can command the device with gestures like rotating one's fingers to adjust volume.Buying the $799 glasses, though, is not easy. Meta requires that people sign-up for in-person demos at stores like Best Buy and LensCrafters before buying the product, and the company warns that \"availability varies by store, so you may not be able to purchase a pair immediately after your demo.\"Early reviews for the display glasses have been mixed. Some reviewers have praised the device's color display, camera and innovative wristband. Still, others have criticized its high price and have said its lack of apps limit functionality.Meta is currently offering a few Black Friday and Cyber Monday deals for some of its various AI-powered smart glasses that will last until Dec. 1.People can save 20% on all versions of the Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 1) at Best Buy, Target, Amazon and also at Meta's website and the Ray-Ban website and stores. Meta is also offering 20% off the cost of prescription lenses for people who buy the Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2) and Oakley Meta HSTN glasses from its website.-- Jonathan VanianFriend AI PendantSource: FriendThe AI friend you wear around as a pendantMost AI chatbots want to make the user more productive. The makers of this smart pendant want AI to be your friend.Users wear Friend, as the product is aptly called, around their necks while the $129 device listens to the conversations happening around it.Friend's chatbot is powered by Google Gemini, and it offers commentary on the user's conversation and life. Those comments appear as notifications through the device's corresponding smartphone app. For example, when one reviewer played a new Taylor Swift song for her AI friend, the device commented through a notification that it didn't \"think it's bad at all\" and \"pretty typical for pop.\"The device is at the center of the societal debate about the rise of AI.Friend plastered a subway station in New York this fall with ads that suggested that the pendant was better than a real friend, promising that it \"will never bail on our dinner plans.\" The posters were immediately defaced with messages like \"AI wouldn't care if you lived or died.\"Those wanting to experience what it's like to wear around an AI friend should place orders swiftly. The company's website currently says units will be shipping \"Winter 2025/26,\" but Friend founder Avi Schiffmann told CNBC that devices ordered early enough will ship before Christmas.  -- Kif LeswingPlaud NoteSource: PlaudPlaud, the AI recorderThe Plaud Note looks more like a credit card than a voice recorder, but it's an ideal purchase for any note taker who wants to capture meetings, lectures or any dictation.With over 30 hours of recording time and battery that last 60 days on standby, the slim device can produce transcriptions in 112 languages. The transcriptions include tags for each speaker on the audio.The recorder's companion app is powered by OpenAI's GPT-5, Anthropic's Claude Sonnet 4 and Google's Gemini 2.5 Pro. The app uses those AI models to generate detailed summaries and notes. Users can select from over 3,000 summary templates, such as phone Q&As or seminar notes.The Plaud App's basic plan offers 300 minutes of transcription per month, though users can upgrade to a pro plan for 1,200 minutes for $8.33 per month or a more expensive unlimited plan for $19.99 per month.The recorder can easily be attached to phones with MagSafe magnets, meaning all Apple smartphones since the iPhone 12 series, or phone cases with similar magnets.The company also offers the Plaud NotePin, a smaller, pill-shaped version of the recorder that can be worn as a magnetic pin, clip, wristband or necklace.Typically priced at $159, both devices are currently on sale for 20% off during Black Friday and Cyber Monday, with another 15% markdown set for Christmas, the company said.-- Jaures YipWATCH: Google releases Gemini 3.0 model, closes gap on ChatGPTwatch now",

Every member of the Magnificent 7, except for Alphabet, posted a losing week, with Nvidia, Amazon and Microsoft staring down the biggest losses. Amazon and Microsoft led the group's drop lower, falling 6% and 7% this week, respectively. Meanwhile, Alphabet gained 8%. The search giant is also the only megacap of the group on pace for November gains thanks to a boost from the launch of Gemini 3.Oracle, which is another major Nvidia customer, slumped about 11%. The chipmaker also supplies major model developers such as OpenAI and Anthropic.Read more CNBC tech newsNvidia is king in AI chips, but Google and Amazon want to catch up by making their ownGoogle must double AI compute every 6 months to meet demand, AI infrastructure boss tells employeesFeds charge 4 in plot to export restricted Nvidia chips to China, Hong KongJoby lawsuit accuses air taxi rival Archer of using stolen information to ‘one-up’ dealChip stocks have also declined amid the broader tech market turmoil. Advanced Micro Devices and Micron slumped more than 16% each, while Marvell Technology dropped 10%. Quantum computing stocks  IonQ and D-Wave fell more than 11% and 13%, respectively.CoreWeave, which buys and rents out Nvidia's chips in data centers, initially soared on the chipmaker's earnings report, but swiftly reversed course. The company's stock took a 7% blow this week.AI fever was cooling in the runup to Nvidia's earnings report on Wednesday, and investors looked to the print to alleviate fears that the AI bubble was on shaky ground. Since the launch of ChatGPT in late 2022, the stock has helped power the market to new all-time highs. But concerns have mounted in recent weeks as tech stocks hit stretched valuations. Major investors, including Bridgewater's Ray Dalio told CNBC Thursday that the market is definitely in a bubble. Much of the worries have stemmed from a boom in capital expenditures spending to support AI, with few signs of a payoff in view for many of the players. Investor Michael Burry recently accused some of the biggest cloud and infrastructure providers of understating depreciation expenses and estimating a longer life cycle for their chips, calling it \"one of the more common frauds of the modern era.\" Earlier this month, Burry revealed bets against Nvidia and Palantir.Shares of the software analytics company, which supplies AI tools to the government and businesses, plunged 11% this week. The stock has shed nearly a quarter of its value this month. WATCH: Bridgewater founder Ray Dalio: We are definitely in a bubble, but that doesn't mean you should sellwatch now",

He highlighted reports from retailers including Burlington Stores, Best Buy and Kohl's, as well as tech giant Dell.\"Every data point, every bit of research and earnings will be scrutinized starting Monday, just like a regular week, even as we'll be eating turkey and then relaxing, with everyone watching the Philadelphia Eagles play the Bears at home on Amazon,\" he said.Zoom is set to report earnings on Monday. While Cramer said he likes the company, he noted that it faces competition from Microsoft's Teams and said he wishes Zoom would buy another company to complement its video conferencing business. But he maintained that he expects a decent quarter from Zoom. Tuesday brings retail sales figures and pending home sales data. Cramer said he expects both reports to be soft, especially after hearing mixed earnings results from some major retailers over the past few days. He also noted that there has not been a lot of housing turnover. However, Cramer suggested weaker data is positive for Wall Street because it paves the way for the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates.A slew of retailers will report Tuesday, including Kohl's, Best Buy, Burlington Stores, Dick's Sporting Goods and Abercrombie & Fitch. Cramer indicated Kohl's and Best Buy would be fine, while Dick's Sporting Goods could be great since the company just acquired Foot Locker and now has access to a number of popular sneaker brands. He suggested Burlington is the weakest of its off-brand retail peers, TJX and Ross Stores, while Abercrombie & Fitch's quarter is a \"a total crapshoot.\"Dell, HP, Zscaler and Analog Devices are also expected to release quarterly reports on Tuesday. Cramer was optimistic about Dell's earnings and expressed confidence in management, but he was not as positive about peer HP. Cramer praised cybersecurity name Zscaler but worried about semiconductor maker Analog Devices.Deere will report Wednesday, and Cramer suggested the farming equipment company has a \"stock that seems like it's made of Teflon.\" While farming can be a tough business, he explained that it benefits from government subsidies, and farmers often spend that money on Deere's products. watch nowSign up now for the CNBC Investing Club to follow Jim Cramer's every move in the market.Disclaimer The CNBC Investing Club holds shares of Microsoft and TJX.Questions for Cramer?

    "body": "U.S. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) speaks, at a campaign event for Republican presidential nominee and former U.S. President Donald Trump, at the Johnny Mercer Theatre Civic Center in Savannah, Georgia, U.S. September 24, 2024. Megan Varner | ReutersRepublican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia announced on Friday that she will resign her seat in the House of Representatives in early January, after a dramatic falling out with President Donald Trump over the  Jeffrey Epstein files and other issues.Greene cited Trump's recent attacks on her — which included calling her a \"traitor\" and a \"lunatic\" — in a video and statement posted on X that said her last day in Congress will be Jan. 5. \"Loyalty should be a two way street and we should be able to vote our conscience and represent our district's interest because our job title is literally, 'Representative,'\" wrote Greene, who is in the middle of a third term representing Georgia's 14th District.After her announcement, Trump told an ABC News reporter, \"I think it's great news for the country. It's great.\"Greene, 51, had been a leading supporter of Trump and a prominent figure in the Republican's Make America Great Again, or MAGA, movement, while sparking controversy for promoting conspiracy theories and using extreme rhetoric.But in recent weeks, Trump has blasted her for backing a bill to compel the Department of Justice to release investigative files about the notorious sex offender Epstein.Greene also has drawn Trump's ire for criticizing him for prioritizing meeting with foreign leaders at the expense of paying attention to the needs of Americans.Trump last week said that he was withdrawing his support and endorsement of Greene, who was first elected in 2020, the year he lost a re-election bid to former President Joe Biden. He said that he would fully support \"the right person\" if they challenged her in the Republican primary next year. In her statement on Friday night, Greene wrote, \"I have too much self respect and dignity, love my family too much, and do not want my sweet district to have to endure a hurtful and hateful primary against me by the President we all fought for, only to fight and win my election while Republicans will likely lose the midterms.\"\"And in turn, be expected to defend the President against impeachment after he hatefully dumped tens of millions of dollars against me and tried to destroy me,\" Greene said.\"It's all so absurd and completely unserious,\" she wrote. \"I refuse to be a 'battered wife' hoping it all goes away and gets better.\"Greene wrote that she had \"fought harder than almost any other elected Republican to elect Donald Trump and Republicans to power,\" and that she had left her mother's side as her father had brain surgery to vote against Trump's second impeachment by the House in 2021.She said that her voting record \"has been solidly with my party and the President,\" with the exceptions of \"a few areas\" such as her stance against H1B visa recipients replacing American jobs, U.S. involvement in foreign wars, \"and demanding the release of the Epstein files.\"\"Standing up for American women who were raped at 14, trafficked and used by rich powerful men, should not result in me being called a traitor and threatened by the President of the United States of America, whom I fought for.\"US Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene (R) speaks alongside former US President and 2024 presidential hopeful Donald Trump at a campaign event in Rome, Georgia, on March 9, 2024. Elijah Nouvelage | AFP | Getty ImagesGreene's resignation from her seat could set the stage for her to seek to replace Trump in the White House in the 2028 election, and possibly become the next leader of the MAGA movement once he exits political life.But Greene's statement conceded that her resignation might end not only her congressional career but also her role in MAGA.\"If I am cast aside by MAGA Inc and replaced by Neocons, Big Pharma, Big Tech, Military Industrial War Complex, foreign leaders, and the elite donor class that can't even relate to real Americans, then many common Americans have been cast aside and replaced as well.\"Greene's resignation will reduce the Republican caucus's already extremely narrow majority in the House.Currently, there are 219 Republican House members and 213 Democratic members.But the 14th District is very conservative and is likely to elect a Republican to replace Greene whenever a special election for her seat is called.",

    "body": "The U.S. Department of Transportation on Wednesday launched a nationwide campaign urging travelers to improve their behavior at airports and on flights, as disruptive incidents remain far above pre-pandemic levels.The effort, called \"The Golden Age of Travel Starts with You,\" aims to restore civility in the skies and address a surge in disruptive behavior. The department said the initiative is meant to \"jumpstart a nationwide conversation around how we can all restore courtesy and class to air travel.\"Disruptive passenger incidents doubled in 2024 compared with 2019, while in-flight outbursts — ranging from inappropriate behavior to physical attacks — surged 400% by 2025.The Department of Transportation said the campaign aimed to improve the travel experience while ensuring the safety of passengers, flight crew and airport staff.In a video promoting the campaign, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy urged travelers to consider their conduct, asking whether they help pregnant passengers or older adults with overhead luggage, or simply say \"please\" and \"thank you.\"He also asked passengers to \"dress with respect\" ahead of the holiday travel season.Of the 82 million Americans expected to travel over the Thanksgiving holiday, about 6 million are expected to commute by plane this year, or a 2% increase from 2024, according to a forecast by the American Automobile Association.International tourism grew 5% in the first half of 2025 from a year ago, reaching almost 690 million passengers, the United Nations World Tourism Organization said. That figure is 4% above the comparable period in 2019.The U.S. isn't alone in pushing for better passenger behavior. The United Kingdom's aviation industry introduced the \"One Too Many\" campaign in 2018 to curb alcohol-related incidents.The European Union Aviation Safety Agency also launched an initiative in 2019 to raise awareness of unruly behavior, noting then that unruly passengers threaten flight safety every 3 hours, with 70% of incidents involving some form of aggression.In 2015, China also began a blacklist of passengers who are disruptive on flights after a series of high-profile incidents. Despite these measures, reports of unruly passenger incidents continue to climb. More than 53,000 incident reports were filed by over 60 operators worldwide, or one incident for every 395 flights in 2024, the International Air Transport Association said in June. That compares with one incident for every 405 flights a year earlier.",

    "body": "A UPS logo on the tail of a cargo jet parked at the UPS Worldport facility in Louisville, Kentucky, U.S.Luke Sharrett | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesThe grounding of MD-11 aircraft after the deadly crash of a UPS plane earlier this month could boost air cargo rates during the peak holiday shipping season, with some capacity out of the market, but analysts aren't expecting a big impact.The Federal Aviation Administration on Nov. 8 prohibited flights of MD-11 planes, less than a week after a Honolulu-bound UPS aircraft crashed moments after takeoff from Louisville Muhammad Ali International Airport in Kentucky, killing the three crew members and 11 people on the ground.Earlier this week, the TAC Index, which tracks air freight rates around the world, said the Baltic Air Freight Index gained more than 4% in the week ended Nov. 17 and that was it up 2.4% last week compared with the same period last year. \"While it is normal for rates to rise ahead of the Thanksgiving holiday in the US and Christmas in Europe, sources suggested they had been given an added boost after the grounding of all MD-11 freighters following a fatal crash in Louisville earlier this month,\" it said in a note.UPS and FedEx each said they were grounding the aircraft, which make up 9% and 5% of their fleets, respectively, according to a Bank of America note.FedEx said the company is working with the FAA to ensure its 28 MD-11 jets are up to standards. \"We are flexing our integrated air-ground network in the most efficient manner possible to deliver outstanding service, which includes the use of contingency options such as utilizing service recovery spare aircraft in the network, leveraging ground service where feasible, and strategically leveraging limited commercial line haul and charter opportunities,\" the company said in a statement to CNBC.UPS said after the crash that it has contingency plans in place to continue providing service.\"We made this decision proactively at the recommendation of the aircraft manufacturer,\" UPS said on Nov. 7. \"Nothing is more important to us than the safety of our employees and the communities we serve.\"In a Friday statement to CNBC, UPS said the company has not instituted any additional peak season surcharges as a result of the grounding of its 26 MD-11s. Instead, the company said it has secured additional aircraft for its fleet, similar to the leased planes that it procures for the peak season, and has consolidated flight routes to maximize air capacity.\"We have reconfigured our ground network, adding additional capacity to move more packages,\" a UPS spokesperson told CNBC. \"Our contingency plans give us assurance that we'll continue to effectively move volume and deliver for our customers now and throughout peak season.\"On the company's most recent earnings call, which occurred before the fatal crash, CEO Carol Tomé said early forecasts from its top 100 customers signaled the peak season would have a \"considerable surge in volume.\" Still, because UPS has begun to phase out its work with Amazon, previously its largest customer, Tomé added that the decrease in Amazon volumes means the total peak season average daily volume in the U.S. will be down year-over-year.Stifel predicted in a note on Wednesday that the operational and financial impact of the grounding would be \"minimal.\"\"Importantly, aircraft will be back flying once approved individually, rather than the entire MD-11 fleet awaiting a singular ruling, and the FAA can effectively deputize outside parties to effectuate the inspections, which have already begun, according to management,\" the Stifel analysts wrote. Air cargo volumes in October rose 4% year-over-year, with cargo supply growing an average of 3% year-over-year in the past four weeks, Bank of America said in a note Monday. The analysts said any potential disruption from the grounding was not immediately clear, but that, overall, it expected a more muted holiday shipping season compared with the past two years.The National Transportation Safety Board, which is leading the investigation into the UPS crash, said the left engine of the jet detached from the wing during takeoff before the plane crashed into a series of businesses just outside of the airport.In its preliminary report it released Thursday, the NTSB said it found evidence of fatigue cracks in the jet, as well as areas of overstress failure.Though UPS is headquartered in Atlanta, the Louisville airport is home to its largest global package handling facility.The crash occurred during the country's longest government shutdown, which promoted disruptions to air travel due to shortages of air traffic controllers. It also limited some cargo flights. Both commercial and dedicated freight companies carry packages and other goods.During the shutdown, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told ABC News that the slowdown in cargo could lead to shortages around the holiday. The shutdown officially ended last week, and air travel disruptions have largely dissipated.Correction: The key points of this story have been updated to reflect the number of people who were killed in the UPS cargo plane crash.",

    "body": "watch nowNvidia outperformed all expectations, reporting soaring profits Wednesday thanks to its graphics processing units that excel at AI workloads. But more categories of AI chips are gaining ground. Custom ASICs, or application-specific integrated circuits, are now being designed by all the major hyperscalers, from Google's TPU to Amazon's Trainium and OpenAI's plans with Broadcom. These chips are smaller, cheaper, accessible and could reduce these companies' reliance on Nvidia GPUs. Daniel Newman of the Futurum Group told CNBC that he sees custom ASICs \"growing even faster than the GPU market over the next few years.\"Besides GPUs and ASICs, there are also field-programmable gate arrays, which can be reconfigured with software after they're made for use in all sorts of applications, like signal processing, networking and AI. There's also an entire group of AI chips that power AI on devices rather than in the cloud. Qualcomm, Apple and others have championed those on-device AI chips. CNBC talked to experts and insiders at the Big Tech companies to break down the crowded space and the various kinds of AI chips out there. GPUs for general computeOnce used primarily for gaming, GPUs made Nvidia the world's most valuable public company after their use shifted toward AI workloads. Nvidia shipped some 6 million current-generation Blackwell GPUs over the past year.Nvidia senior director of AI infrastructure Dion Harris shows CNBC's Katie Tarasov how 72 Blackwell GPUs work together as one in a GB200 NVL72 rack-scale server system for AI at Nvidia headquarters in Santa Clara, California, on November 12, 2025.Marc GanleyThe shift from gaming to AI started around 2012, when Nvidia's GPUs were used by researchers to build AlexNet, what many consider to be modern AI's big bang moment. AlexNet was a tool that was entered into a prominent image recognition contest. Whereas others in the contest used central processing units for their applications, AlexNet reliance on GPUs provided incredible accuracy and obliterated its competition. AlexNet's creators discovered that the same parallel processing that helps GPUs render lifelike graphics was also great for training neural networks, in which a computer learns from data rather than relying on a programmer's code. AlexNet showcased the potential of GPUs. Today, GPUs are often paired with CPUs and sold in server rack systems to be placed in data centers, where they run AI workloads in the cloud. CPUs have a small number of powerful cores running sequential general-purpose tasks, while GPUs have thousands of smaller cores more narrowly focused on parallel math like matrix multiplication. Because GPUs can perform many operations simultaneously, they're ideal for the two main phases of AI computation: training and inference. Training teaches the AI model to learn from patterns in large amounts of data, while inference uses the AI to make decisions based on new information.GPUs are the general-purpose workhorses of Nvidia and its top competitor, Advanced Micro Devices. Software is a major differentiator between the two GPU leaders. While Nvidia GPUs are tightly optimized around CUDA, Nvidia's proprietary software platform, AMD GPUs use a largely open-source software ecosystem.AMD and Nvidia sell their GPUs to cloud providers like Amazon, Microsoft, Google, Oracle and CoreWeave. Those companies then rent the GPUs to AI companies by the hour or minute. Anthropic's $30 billion deal with Nvidia and Microsoft, for example, includes 1 gigawatt of compute capacity on Nvidia GPUs. AMD has also recently landed big commitments from OpenAI and Oracle.Nvidia also sells directly to AI companies, like a recent deal to sell at least 4 million GPUs to OpenAI, and to foreign governments, including South Korea, Saudi Arabia and the U.K.The chipmaker told CNBC that it charges around $3 million for one of its server racks with 72 Blackwell GPUs acting as one, and ships about 1,000 each week. Dion Harris, Nvidia's senior director of AI infrastructure, told CNBC he couldn't have imagined this much demand when he joined Nvidia over eight years ago. \"When we were talking to people about building a system that had eight GPUs, they thought that was overkill,\" he said.ASICs for custom cloud AITraining on GPUs has been key in the early boom days of large language models, but inference is becoming more crucial as the models mature. Inference can happen on less powerful chips that are programmed for more specific tasks. That's where ASICs come in. While a GPU is like a Swiss Army Knife able to do many kinds of parallel math for different AI workloads, an ASIC is like a single-purpose tool. It's very efficient and fast, but hard-wired to do the exact math for one type of job.Google released its 7th generation TPU, Ironwood, in November 2025, a decade after making its first custom ASIC for AI in 2015.Google\"You can't change them once they're already carved into silicon, and so there's a trade off in terms of flexibility,\" said Chris Miller, author of \"Chip War.\"Nvidia's GPUs are flexible enough for adoption by many AI companies, but they cost up to $40,000 and can be hard to get. Still, startups rely on GPUs because designing a custom ASIC has an even higher up-front cost, starting at tens of millions of dollars, according to Miller.For the biggest cloud providers who can afford them, analysts say custom ASICs pay off in the long-run.\"They want to have a little bit more control over the workloads that they build,\" Newsom said. \"At the same time, they're going to continue to work very closely with Nvidia, with AMD, because they also need the capacity. The demand is so insatiable.\"Google was the first Big Tech company to make a custom ASIC for AI acceleration, coining the term Tensor Processing Unit when its first ASIC came out in 2015. Google said it considered making a TPU as far back as 2006, but the situation became \"urgent\" in 2013 as it realized AI was going to double its number of data centers. In 2017, the TPU also contributed to Google's invention of the Transformer, the architecture powering almost all modern AI.A decade after its first TPU, Google released its seventh generation TPU in November. Anthropic announced it will train its LLM Claude on up to 1 million TPUs. Some people think TPUs are technically on par or superior to Nvidia's GPUs, Miller said. \"Traditionally, Google has only used them for in-house purposes,\" Miller said. \"There's a lot of speculation that in the longer run, Google might open up access to TPUs more broadly.\"Amazon Web Services was the next cloud provider to design its own AI chips, after acquiring Israeli chip startup Annapurna labs in 2015. AWS announced Inferentia in 2018, and it launched Trainium in 2022. AWS is expected to announce Trainium's third generation as soon December. Ron Diamant, Trainium's head architect, told CNBC that Amazon's ASIC has 30% to 40% better price performance compared to other hardware vendors in AWS. \"Over time, we've seen that Trainium chips can serve both inference and training workloads quite well,\" Diamant said. CNBC's Katie Tarasov holds Amazon Web Services' Trainium 2 AI chip that fill its new AI data center in New Carlisle, Indiana, on October 8, 2025.Erin BlackIn October, CNBC went to Indiana for the first on-camera tour of Amazon's biggest AI data center, where Anthropic is training its models on half a million Trainium2 chips. AWS fills its other data centers with Nvidia GPUs to meet the demand from AI customers like OpenAI.Building ASICs isn't easy. This is why companies turn to chip designers Broadcom and Marvell. They \"provide the IP and the know-how and the networking\" to help their clients build their ASICs, Miller said.\"So you've seen Broadcom in particular be one of the biggest beneficiaries of the AI boom,\" Miller said. Broadcom helped build Google's TPUs and Meta's Training and Inference Accelerator launched in 2023, and has a new deal to help OpenAI build its own custom ASICs starting in 2026.Microsoft is also getting into the ASIC game, telling CNBC that its in-house Maia 100 chips are currently deployed in its data centers in the eastern U.S. Others include Qualcomm with the A1200, Intel with its  Gaudi AI accelerators and Tesla with its AI5 chip. There's also a slew of start-ups going all in on custom AI chips, including Cerebras, which makes huge full-wafer AI chips, and Groq, with inference-focused language processing units.In China, Huawei, ByteDance, and Alibaba are making custom ASICs, although export controls on the most advanced equipment and AI chips pose a challenge.Edge AI with NPUs and FPGAsThe final big category of AI chips are those made to run on devices, rather than in the cloud. These chips are typically built into a device's main System on a Chip, SoC. Edge AI chips, as they're called, enable devices to have AI capabilities while helping them save battery life and space for other components.\"You'll be able to do that right on your phone with very low latency, so you don't have to have communication all the way back to a data center,\" said Saif Khan, former White House AI and semiconductor policy advisor. \"And you can preserve privacy of your data on your phone.\"Neural processing units are a major type of edge AI chip. Qualcomm, Intel and AMD are making NPUs that enable AI capabilities in personal computers. Although Apple doesn't use the term NPU, the in-house M-series chips inside its MacBooks include a dedicated neural engine. Apple also built neural accelerators into the latest iPhone A-series chips.\"It is efficient for us. It is responsive. We know that we are much more in control over the experience,\" Tim Millet, Apple platform architecture vice president, told CNBC in an exclusive September interview. The latest Android phones also have NPUs built into their primary Qualcomm Snapdragon chips, and Samsung has its own NPU on its Galaxy phones, too. NPUs by companies like NXP and Nvidia power AI embedded in cars, robots, cameras, smart home devices and more.\"Most of the dollars are going towards the data center, but over time that's going to change because we'll have AI deployed in our phones and our cars and wearables, all sorts of other applications to a much greater degree than today,\" Miller said.Then there's field-programmable gate arrays, or FPGAs, which can be reconfigured with software after they're made. Although far more flexible than NPUs or ASICs, FPGAs have lower raw performance and lower energy efficiency for AI workloads.AMD became the largest FPGA maker after acquiring Xilinx for $49 billion in 2022, with Intel in second thanks to its $16.7 billion purchase of Altera in 2015.These players designing AI chips rely on a single company to manufacture them all: Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company. TSMC has a giant new chip fabrication plant in Arizona, where Apple has committed to moving some chip production. In October, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said Blackwell GPUs were in \"full production\" in Arizona, too. Although the AI chip space is crowded, dethroning Nvidia won't come easily.\"They have that position because they've earned it and they've spent the years building it,\" Newman said. \"They've won that developer ecosystem.\"Watch the video to see a breakdown of how all the AI chips work: https://www.cnbc.com/video/2025/11/21/nvidia-gpus-google-tpus-aws-trainium-comparing-the-top-ai-chips.html  ",

French authorities said Wednesday they were investigating the oil tanker Boracay anchored off the Atlantic Coast and suspected of being part of Russia's clandestine \"shadow fleet\".Damien Meyer | Afp | Getty ImagesOil prices extended declines and energy stocks fell on Friday as U.S. President Donald Trump pushed for a peace deal to end the long-running Russia-Ukraine war. International benchmark Brent crude futures with January expiry fell 1.29% to close at $62.56 per barrel.The contract dipped 0.2% in the previous session.U.S. West Texas Intermediate futures with January expiry shed 1.59% to settle at $58.06, after closing Thursday off 0.5%.  Europe's Stoxx Oil and Gas index, meanwhile, slipped more than 2.4%. Britain's Shell and BP were both trading around 1.4% lower. Norway's Equinor fell 2.3%, while Germany's Siemens Energy plunged nearly 8%. U.S. oil giants Exxon Mobil and Chevron traded 1.1% and 0.6% lower, respectively, on Friday.The bearish market sentiment comes as investors pore over the details of the Trump administration's push to secure a peace deal between Russia and Ukraine. The U.S., under a widely leaked plan, has reportedly proposed that Ukraine cede land including Crimea, Luhansk and Donetsk, and pledge never to join the NATO military alliance.  The plan also says Kyiv will receive \"reliable\" security guarantees, while the size of the Ukrainian Armed Forces will be limited to 600,000 personnel, according to The Associated Press, which obtained a copy of the draft proposal. CNBC has not been able to independently verify the report.Analysts were doubtful that the peace plan, which is thought to be favorable toward Russia, would be backed by Ukraine. Read moreGuntram Wolff, senior fellow at Bruegel, a Brussels-based think tank, was among those skeptical about whether the proposed peace plan could lead to a deal.\"I think it's always good to talk each other so in that sense it's a good development but I have to say when I saw the details of this supposed peace plan, I really don't think it can fly,\" Wolff told CNBC's \"Europe Early Edition\" on Friday. \"Because at the core, what it says is that Ukraine should give up significant parts of its military personnel, meaning the military personnel would decrease by something like a third from 900,000 to 600,000,\" he added.

There are about 11,000 fully certified air traffic controllers in the U.S., according to their union.\"These patriotic men and women never missed a beat and kept the flying public safe throughout the shutdown,\" Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said in a release late Thursday.The DOT and FAA didn't immediately say whether preplanned vacation time or fatigue calls would disqualify controllers and technicians from the bonus.An increase in absences of air traffic controllers, who were required to work without their regular paychecks during the more than 40-day shutdown, the longest ever, forced airlines to slow or cancel flights. The shutdown ended Nov. 12 with a bill to fund the government through January.The shutdown's disruptions and additional strain on air traffic controllers, many of whom are already required to work six-day weeks, sparked an outcry from the aviation industry, which urged lawmakers to ensure critical workers aren't left without pay if there's another shutdown.Read more CNBC airline newsThe government shutdown is over.

    "body": "A sign with the company logo sits outside of the headquarters of Eli Lilly in Indianapolis, Indiana, on March 17, 2024.Scott Olson | Getty ImagesEli Lilly reached a $1 trillion market capitalization on Friday, the first health-care company in the world to join the exclusive club dominated by tech firms.Eli Lilly briefly hit the $1 trillion mark in morning trading before retreating. It was last trading around $1,048 a share. Eli Lilly is the second nontechnology company to reach the coveted $1 trillion mark in the U.S. after Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway.The drugmaker's stock has climbed more than 36% this year as investors applaud the gains it has made over chief rival Novo Nordisk in the GLP-1 drug space. The Indianapolis-based company's stock has been riding the skyrocketing popularity of its weight loss injection Zepbound and diabetes treatment Mounjaro. Stock Chart IconStock chart iconEli Lilly's stock has soared on the back of the success of its drugs Mounjaro and Zepbound.Demand is only expected to grow as approvals for the treatments' uses and insurance coverage expand.The two drugs have driven eye-popping sales growth for Eli Lilly. Last month, the company said Mounjaro drew in $6.52 billion in revenue in the third quarter, a 109% increase from the previous year. Meanwhile, Zepbound posted $3.59 billion in sales during the period, a 184% spike from the prior-year period.Demand for the treatments will only grow as approvals for their use and insurance coverage expand. In addition, Eli Lilly expects an oral version of its popular drugs to hit the market next year, which could give patients a more convenient option than a shot that is easier for the company to produce.Eli Lilly will likely remain a dominant player in the weight loss drug market, which some analysts believe could be worth more than $150 billion by the early 2030s. But despite its recent struggles and leadership shake-ups, Novo Nordisk remains a formidable rival for Eli Lilly in the space. Pfizer also made a push forward in the market, as well, when it won a $10 billion bidding war with Novo Nordisk for obesity drugmaker Metsera earlier this month.The runaway success of Zepbound, MounjaroEli Lilly, a pharmaceutical chemist and Union veteran of the U.S. Civil War, founded his namesake company in 1876. It has long been at the forefront of the diabetes treatment space, introducing the world's first commercial insulin in 1923. Eli Lilly became a publicly traded company on the New York Stock Exchange by 1952, and for decades relied on a slate of widely successful products to drive much of its profits and revenue. That included insulins, the antidepressant pill Prozac and the earliest polio vaccine. An Eli Lilly & Co. Zepbound injection pen, March 28, 2024.Bloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesEli Lilly hit the jackpot with the May 2022 approval of tirzepatide for diabetes, which is sold as Mounjaro. It started to compete with Novo Nordisk's diabetes injection Ozempic, which had entered the market a few years earlier. But Eli Lilly brought a new way to treat diabetes and eventually, obesity. Tirzepatide works by imitating two hormones produced in the gut called GLP-1 and GIP. GLP-1 helps reduce food intake and appetite. GIP, which also suppresses appetite, may also improve how the body breaks down sugar and fat.Meanwhile, Novo Nordisk's semaglutide, the active ingredient in Ozempic and its weight loss drug Wegovy, only targets GLP-1. Mounjaro achieved \"blockbuster\" status — meaning it generated more than $1 billion in annual sales — during its first full year on the market. Eli Lilly then won approval in late 2023 for tirzepatide as a treatment for obesity, which is sold as Zepbound and now competes with Novo Nordisk's Wegovy. By 2024, Mounjaro pulled in $11.54 billion in sales, while Zepbound posted $4.93 billion in revenue.More CNBC health coverageThe Trump administration is changing Covid, childhood vaccine recommendations – here's what it means for youU.S. to impose 100% tariff on branded, patented drugs unless firms build plants locally, Trump saysEli Lilly to build $6.5 billion Texas manufacturing facility for obesity pill, other drugs",

    "body": "Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat from Massachusetts and ranking member of Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee, speaks during a hearing in Washington, Feb. 5, 2026.Kent Nishimura | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesSen. Elizabeth Warren asked the Treasury Department and the Federal Reserve on Wednesday to confirm that they will not \"use taxpayer dollars to bail out cryptocurrency billionaires and other highly leveraged cryptocurrency investors.\"The Massachusetts Democrat's request to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Fed Chair Jerome Powell came as bitcoin continued a slide that has seen the popular cryptocurrency drop about 50% since hitting a high in October.Warren, in a letter to Bessent and Powell about a potential bailout, warned that it not only \"would be deeply unpopular to transfer wealth from American taxpayers to cryptocurrency billionaires, it could also directly enrich President [Donald] Trump and his family's cryptocurrency company, World Liberty Financial.\"She noted that both the Treasury Department and the Fed have authorities that empower them to give financial support to banks and other entities during a financial crisis.\"Concerningly, at a recent hearing, in an exchange regarding his authority to bail out the cryptocurrency industry, Secretary Bessent was asked whether 'the money of our taxpayers … is … going to be deployed into crypto assets,'\" Warren wrote, referring to the secretary's testimony on Feb. 6 to the House Financial Services Committee.\"Rather than giving a simple 'no,' he deflected, stating that '[w]e are retaining seized bitcoin,'\" Warren wrote. \"It's deeply unclear what, if any, plans the U.S. government currently has to intervene in the current Bitcoin selloff.\"Read more CNBC politics coverageBillionaire Les Wexner's congressional deposition over Jeffrey Epstein ties is underwayTrump administration sued for Stonewall Pride flag removal in New YorkPotomac River sewage spill: Trump says Democrats need to ask for his helpStephen Colbert says CBS blocked James Talarico interview from air\"Ultimately, any government intervention to stabilize Bitcoin would disproportionately benefit crypto billionaires,\" wrote Warren, who is the ranking Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee. \"Your agencies must refrain from propping up Bitcoin and transferring wealth from taxpayers to crypto billionaires through direct purchases, guarantees, or liquidity facilities.\"The Treasury Department and Fed did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Warren's letter.The letter came on the same day that World Liberty Financial hosted its first World Liberty Forum for business leaders at Trump's Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Florida.In the letter, Warren said the sell-off in bitcoin \"has been amplified by cascading liquidations of leveraged positions.\"She wrote that Trump's crypto company World Liberty Financial \"has sold around 173 wrapped Bitcoin.\"\"This transaction was made to repay $11.75 million in USDC stablecoin debt, thereby avoiding liquidation as Bitcoin's price dropped below $63,000,\" she wrote.\"During this selloff, crypto billionaires have taken massive hits, as Bitcoin's value continues to plummet. Crypto billionaire Michael Saylor's Strategy Inc., one of the largest corporate holders of Bitcoin, has reportedly seen its shares fall nearly 20% since the beginning of the year,\" Warren wrote.\"Other major Bitcoin investors have also seen losses, including Binance founder Changpeng Zhao, who reportedly lost nearly $30 billion, and Coinbase's Brian Armstrong, who reportedly lost $7 billion.\"Elsewhere in the letter, Warren said that federal financial agencies \"must strengthen protections for retail crypto investors.\"She noted that in 2025, a record $17 billion was lost or stolen in crypto fraud.Correction: This story has been revised to reflect that bitcoin has lost about half its value since its October high. A previous version mischaracterized the extent of its drop in value.",

    "body": "President Donald Trump stops and talks to the media before he boards Marine One on the South Lawn at the White House in Washington, June 15, 2025.Tasos Katopodis | Getty ImagesPresident Donald Trump is escalating his crusade for voter identification requirements after last week's promise of an executive order to implement such a mandate before November's midterm elections.White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt in a briefing Wednesday said Trump is \"discussing and exploring legal options for a potential executive order with respect to voter ID,\" days after Trump said he would find a way to require voters to present identification across the U.S., \"whether approved by Congress or not!\"Leavitt's comments followed a Tuesday night Trump Truth Social post of an article about a local elected official urging the Georgia state government to take over voting in Fulton County, the target of a recent FBI raid and a precinct that Trump lost to Joe Biden in 2020. Trump is planning to travel to a different part of Georgia on Thursday to talk about the economy.Trump's recent fixation on elections and congressional Republicans' willingness to largely fall in line are raising alarms for Democrats and voting rights groups, who see the recent moves as a potential existential threat to American elections and an extension of Trump's past election denialism. The topic has apparently been front of mind for the president. In a series of reposts on Truth Social that followed his initial post Wednesday, Trump shared unfounded claims about irregularities in the 2020 election. \"[Democrats] don't want voter ID because they want to cheat at elections,\" Trump told reporters on Air Force One on Monday. \"If you had voter ID, if you had proof of citizenship, they could never win an election. And they know that. And they're fighting them to the hilt.\"Read more CNBC politics coverageBillionaire Les Wexner's congressional deposition over Jeffrey Epstein ties is underwayTrump administration sued for Stonewall Pride flag removal in New YorkPotomac River sewage spill: Trump says Democrats need to ask for his helpStephen Colbert says CBS blocked James Talarico interview from air\"When [Republicans] win an election, they win fair and square,\" Rep. Greg Stanton, D-Ariz., said in an interview this week. \"But then when they lose elections, Donald Trump likes to say it was based on fraud.\"Stanton is the chair of the New Democrat Coalition Action Fund, a political action committee that works to get moderate Democrats elected to the U.S. House. He called Trump's threat to unilaterally impose voter ID requirements \"purely bluster.\"Rep. Joe Morelle, D-N.Y., the top Democrat on the House Administration Committee, similarly said \"the Constitution is pretty clear.\"\"Time, place and manner of elections shall be up to the states … Congress may at its discretion get involved as well. But there's no role for the president,\" Morelle said in an interview Wednesday.SAVE America Act moves to the SenateMeanwhile, support is growing among the Senate GOP for a bill that would require proof of citizenship to register to vote and the presenting of identification to cast a ballot.The SAVE America Act targets noncitizen voting, which is already illegal and exceedingly rare, and requires voter ID. It advanced out of the House last week on a 218-213 vote, with just one Democrat, Rep. Henry Cuellar of Texas, voting in favor. Both of the bill's main components are broadly popular, according to public polling. But opponents say the legislation could disenfranchise millions and create barriers to voting for minorities, college students and married women who changed their last names.While some congressional Republicans have shown a willingness to buck Trump in recent months on things like tariffs and Affordable Care Act subsidies, most have followed his lead on elections.Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, is the lone Senate Republican to publicly oppose the bill, while nearly all of her GOP colleagues have signed on.Still, the measure faces an uphill climb in the Senate, where rules require 60 votes to overcome a filibuster, meaning more than a handful of Democrats would have to vote with their Republican colleagues to advance the legislation.GOP proponents of the bill, including its lead sponsor Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, have called for changing the filibuster rule to allow a simple majority to prevail. Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., has promised a vote on the SAVE America Act, which he supports, but has been cool to the idea of changing the filibuster. Meanwhile, a second, even broader election reform proposal has cropped up in the House. In addition to requiring voter ID and proof of citizenship, the Make Elections Great Again Act, introduced by Rep. Bryan Steil, R-Wis., in January, would disqualify mail-in ballots received after the close of polls on Election Day, require states to use auditable paper ballots, and ban ballot harvesting, ranked choice voting and universal vote-by-mail. A spokesperson for House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., declined to comment when asked if the speaker planned to bring the MEGA Act to the floor, instead referring to the speaker's past comments on the passage of the SAVE America Act. The House Administration Committee, which Steil chairs, held a hearing on the MEGA Act last week.During a recent appearance on Fox Business after House passage of the SAVE America Act, Steil said Republicans \"need to build on that work.\"\"I think we need to clean up our voter rolls. I think we should make sure that ballots are in by the end of Election Day. We need proper, auditable ballots. The list goes on,\" Steil said.",

    "body": "Dylan Field, co-founder and chief executive officer of Figma, speaks during a Bloomberg Television interview outside of the New York Stock Exchange in New York on July 31, 2025.Michael Nagle | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesFigma shares surged 15% in extended trading on Wednesday after the design software maker reported robust results and quarterly guidance than Wall Street had predicted.Here's how the company did in comparison with LSEG consensus:Earnings per share: 8 cents adjusted vs. 7 cents expectedRevenue: $303.8 million vs. $293.15 million expectedFigma's revenue grew 40% year over year in the fourth quarter, according to a statement. The company had a net loss of $226.6 million, or 44 cents per share, compared with net income of $33.1 million, or 15 cents per share, in the fourth quarter of 2024.Management called for $315 million to $317 million in first-quarter revenue, which implies 38% growth. Analysts polled by LSEG were expecting $292 million.For 2026, Figma sees $100 million to $110 million in adjusted operating income on $1.366 billion to $1.374 billion in revenue, which would suggest 30% revenue growth. The LSEG revenue consensus was $1.29 billion.Lately, investors have become more concerned that generative artificial intelligence products could weaken the growth prospects of software companies. As of Wednesday's close, Figma shares were down about 35% year to date, while the iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector Exchange-Traded Fund has slipped 22%. The S&P 500 index has gained almost 1% in the same period.Customers are sticking around and spending more. Figma's net dollar retention from clients contributing at least $10,000 in annualized revenue increased to 136% from 131% in the third quarter, outdoing internal expectations, Praveer Melwani, the company's finance chief, said on a conference call with analysts. \"If you look at software, not only is it not going away. There's going to be way more of it than ever before,\" Figma's co-founder and CEO, Dylan Field, said in a Wednesday interview. But he said the market is \"potentially increasingly competitive.\"watch nowThe company, which went public in July, wants to ensure it can benefit as people turn to AI products for design. The Figma Make tool allows people to type in a few words and have AI models from Anthropic and Google interpret the information to craft app prototypes. More than half of customers spending over $100,000 in annualized revenue had people using Figma Make every week during the quarter, according to the statement.Figma managed to lower the cost of running the Make service for end users by optimizing its computing infrastructure, Melwani said. The company's adjusted gross margin stayed put at 86%, despite that Figma Make weekly active users increased 70% from the third quarter.Soon Figma will be bringing in more revenue from AI adoption. In March, it will start enforcing monthly AI credit limits for different types of account holders. Clients will pay based on monthly usage or sign up for AI credit subscriptions, according to a blog post from December.\"What we've observed is it tends to be a power law distribution, where a subset of users within an organization are receiving outsized value, and as such, are going over the projected limits that we intend to enforce,\" Melwani said. \"Now, our expectation is that that will continue to evolve.\"Also during the quarter, Figma announced a collaboration with ServiceNow to convert designs into applications for large companies to adopt.\"We were pleased to see positive commentary around both Figma Make and Figma Design, indicating increased adoption of AI workflows across Figma's platform,\" RBC analyst Rishi Jaluria, with the equivalent of a hold rating on the stock, wrote in a note to clients.There could be room for Figma to address new kinds of corporate workers, beyond developers, designers and marketers. Product managers, for instance, are increasingly involved on Figma files, Field said on the conference call with analysts.\"I think that overall, there's a lot of opportunity to start to reach into use cases like UX [user experience] researchers and other use cases around the team as well,\" he said.WATCH: How the AI sell-off ripped through softwarewatch now",

    "body": "US President Donald Trump speaks during a Black History Month event in the East Room of the White House in Washington, DC, on Feb. 18, 2026. Saul Loeb | AFP | Getty ImagesPresident Donald Trump on Wednesday issued an executive order invoking the Defense Production Act to promote the domestic production of phosphorus and the weedkiller glyphosate, which he said is critical to both defense and food security.Glyphosate is often targeted by supporters of the Make America Healthy Again movement as a harmful chemical. Trump aligned with the MAHA movement after Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr. dropped out of the 2024 election.\"I find that ensuring robust domestic elemental phosphorus mining and United States-based production of glyphosate-based herbicides is central to American economic and national security,\" Trump said in the order. \"Without immediate Federal action, the United States remains inadequately equipped and vulnerable.\"Read more CNBC politics coverageBillionaire Les Wexner's congressional deposition over Jeffrey Epstein ties is underwayTrump administration sued for Stonewall Pride flag removal in New YorkPotomac River sewage spill: Trump says Democrats need to ask for his helpStephen Colbert says CBS blocked James Talarico interview from airGlyphosate has long been used in U.S. agriculture and has been the subject of controversy over alleged links to cancer. Bayer, the company that makes the glyphosate-based weedkiller Roundup, recently proposed paying $7.25 billion to settle lawsuits claiming the chemical causes cancer.Roundup products are seen for sale at a store in San Rafael, California.Josh Edelson | AFP | Getty ImagesPhosphorus, which is also covered in the order, is a precursor to the production of glyphosate and is also used in the manufacturing of certain military equipment. The order will require Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins to issue orders and regulations to implement the increased supply of phosphorus and glyphosate.A White House Fact sheet on the executive order said Trump signed it to \"ensure domestic production of elemental phosphorus and glyphosate-based herbicides, the loss of which would cripple critical supply chains.\"A lack of either chemical, the fact sheet said, could \"leave our defense industrial base and food supply vulnerable to hostile foreign actors,\" since there is only \"one domestic producer of elemental phosphorus and glyphosate-based herbicides.\"Kennedy once won a nearly $290 million case against Roundup producer Monsanto, which has since been bought by Bayer, for a man who alleged he developed cancer from using the weedkiller. Since being nominated as Trump's HHS chief, however, he has softened his tone on the chemical. \"We cannot take any step that will put a single farmer in this country out of business,\" he said during a hearing last year. \"There's a million farmers who rely on glyphosate.\"CNBC has reached out to HHS for comment. Monsanto said in a statement to CNBC that the executive order \"reinforces the critical need for U.S. farmers to have access to essential, domestically produced crop protection tools such as glyphosate.\"  \"We will comply with this order to produce glyphosate and elemental phosphorus,\" the company said.

    "body": "A Walmart store is shown in  Oceanside, California, U.S., May 15, 2025. Mike Blake | ReutersWalmart is expected to report its fiscal fourth-quarter earnings on Thursday morning as the retail giant and its new CEO chase a future fueled more by digital businesses and artificial intelligence.Here's what Wall Street analysts surveyed by LSEG are expecting the company to report:Earnings per share: 73 cents expectedRevenue:  $190.43 billion expectedWalmart said in November that it expects full-year net sales to climb between 4.8% and 5.1% and adjusted earnings per share to range from $2.58 to $2.63. Investors are not only looking for a holiday and full-year recap. They're also eager for a better sense of the company's expectations for the year ahead and the priorities for new CEO John Furner, a more than three-decade-long company veteran and former Walmart U.S. CEO who succeeded Doug McMillon as Walmart's top executive on Feb. 1.As a retail behemoth, Walmart offers a key snapshot of the U.S. consumer — particularly since it kicks off a batch of earnings reports from other major retailers, including Home Depot and Target.\"Everybody likes to get a litmus test on how the consumer acted in the quarter and how they are acting quarter to date,\" said Kate McShane, a retail analyst for Goldman Sachs.She said Walmart could benefit from some helpful dynamics in the coming months, including tax cuts that were part of President Donald Trump's tax and spending bill last year that may free up more discretionary spending, especially for middle-income consumers. Yet there are other mixed indicators about the U.S. economy, such as lackluster retail sales numbers in December and concerns about the jobs market and artificial intelligence-related head count cuts, despite a better-than-expected jobs report for January. Investors have closely watched inflation and tried to gauge if tariffs will increase prices in the coming weeks and months, too.Investors largely expect Furner to focus on similar priorities as his predecessor McMillon, such as increasing Walmart's online business, attracting more customers across incomes and ramping up higher-margin businesses like its third-party marketplace and advertising.However, Walmart is expected to lose the title as the largest retailer by annual revenue on Thursday. Amazon already surpassed Walmart on quarterly revenue and it is on track to top Walmart on an annual basis. Amazon's core retail unit is the company's biggest revenue driver, but it gets a sizeable chunk of its business from its cloud computing, advertising and seller services businesses. Along with getting a new CEO, Walmart has hit other milestones lately. Its stock switched to the tech-heavy Nasdaq in December and its market value hit $1 trillion earlier this month.As of Wednesday's close, shares of the company have climbed about 22% over the past year and about 14% so far this year. That's outpaced the S&P 500's 12% gains over the past year and less than 1% gains year to date. ",

Kevin Carter | Getty ImagesMortgage interest rates dropped last week to the lowest level in a month, prompting more current borrowers to seek savings in a refinance. While lower rates didn't give potential buyers much incentive, the run on refinances was enough to push total mortgage demand 2.8% higher compared with the previous week, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association's seasonally adjusted index. The average contract interest rate for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages with conforming loan balances, $832,750 or less, decreased to 6.17% from 6.21%, with points remaining unchanged at 0.56, including the origination fee, for loans with a 20% down payment. \"Treasury yields ended the week lower as weaker data on retail sales and home sales outweighed better-than-expected readings on the job market for January,\" said Joel Kan, vice president and deputy chief economist at the MBA, in a release. As a result, applications to refinance a home loan rose 7% for the week and were 132% higher than the same week one year ago. Last year, rates were 76 basis points higher. While that annual jump may seem large, refinancing was at extremely low levels at this time last year. \"Refinance applications increased across all loan types, marking the strongest week for refinancing since mid-January,\" Kan added.Get Property Play directly to your inboxCNBC's Property Play with Diana Olick covers new and evolving opportunities for the real estate investor, delivered weekly to your inbox.Subscribe here to get access today.Applications for a mortgage to purchase a home dropped 3% for the week and were just 8% higher than the same week one year ago. While lower mortgage rates are making homes slightly more affordable, new supply is not coming onto the market fast enough, and concern over the broader economy has consumers sitting on the sidelines. Mortgage rates didn't move at all to start this holiday-shortened week, but economic data set for release this week could impact the current trajectory. In general, however, mortgage rates have been hovering in a pretty narrow range, between 6% and 6.25%, since the start of this year. ",

    "body": "watch nowWhite House economic advisor Kevin Hassett said Wednesday that the authors of a recent New York Federal Reserve paper that found U.S. companies and consumers are shouldering most of the tariff burden should be \"disciplined.\"In a CNBC interview, the National Economic Council director ripped the report, saying that central bank researchers ignored key aspects of how the duties worked and instead simply focused on prices. Hassett said the research also should have included the upward impact on wages and benefits that U.S. companies see by bringing more production onshore.\"I mean, the paper is an embarrassment,\" Hassett said during the \"Squawk Box\" interview. \"It's, I think, the worst paper I've ever seen in the history of the Federal Reserve system. The people associated with this paper should presumably be disciplined, because what they've done is they've put out a conclusion which has created a lot of news that's highly partisan based on analysis that wouldn't be accepted in a first-semester econ class.\"The paper in question was published Feb. 12 on the New York Fed's website.Essentially, the researchers looked at whether countries that export products to the U.S. were lowering their prices, or in effect eating the tariffs, or raising their prices and passing them onto consumers and companies. The paper found that some 90% of the added costs from tariffs were being passed on, though it noted that the impact waned slightly as the year progressed.However, Hassett insisted that the tariffs had little impact on prices and were responsible for a better standard of living.\"Prices have gone down. Inflation is down over time. Import prices dropped a lot in the first half of the year, that leveled off, and real wages were up $1,400 on average last year, which means that consumers were made better off by the tariffs,\" he said. \"So consumers couldn't have been made better off by the tariffs, if this New York Fed analysis was correct. It's really just an embarrassment. I can't imagine who signed off on it.\"The consumer price index in January rose 2.4% from a year ago and is up nearly 2% from April 2025, when President Donald Trump first announced the tariffs. The core CPI, which excludes food and energy, was up 2.5% in January, its lowest annual gain since March 2021. Import prices in December were flat from a year ago while export prices rose 3.1%, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.A New York Fed official declined comment.",

The CEO was echoing a comment that Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent made during testimony on Feb. 5 to the Senate Banking Committee backing a cryptocurrency market bill structure bill, the CLARITY Act.El Salvador's government has purchased bitcoin since 2022. Because of the decline in bitcoin's price, the value of El Salvador's holdings of that cryptocurrency has fallen to about $500 million, down from a high of $800 million last year.Solomon commented weeks after a Senate committee advanced the CLARITY ACT, which would create a national regulatory structure for crypto.That bill has stalled over a dispute about whether digital asset companies would be allowed to offer customers rewards, or payments on stablecoins that are held in those companies. Banks have opposed such rewards, which could compete with their interest payments on depositors' accounts.\"We have to get this CLARITY Act across the finish line,\" Bessent said during his testimony at the Banking Committee after Sen. Cynthia Lummis, R-Wyo., asked his opinion on the importance of having \"clear rules of the road\" for cryptocurrency in the U.S.Solomon said Wednesday that he is \"super-interested in\" crypto-related business.Read more CNBC politics coverageBillionaire Les Wexner's congressional deposition over Jeffrey Epstein ties is underwayTrump administration sued for Stonewall Pride flag removal in New YorkPotomac River sewage spill: Trump says Democrats need to ask for his helpStephen Colbert says CBS blocked James Talarico interview from air\"We obviously are doing a bunch of things around digitization and tokenization,\" he said.\"We touch all that stuff,\" Solomon said.But, he added, \"it doesn't mean it's central to what we do. These kinds of assets are still a small percentage\" of Goldman's business.\"We have clients, our clients have needs, we're here to serve our clients.\"Sen. Bernie Moreno, R-Ohio, earlier Wednesday at the conference, told Eisen on CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" that he still has \"some concerns\" about the crypto market structure bill, but \"hopefully by April\" it will be passed by Congress and be able to be signed by President Donald Trump.Moreno brushed aside concerns that if the bill is not passed soon, it could die because of the chance that Democrats would regain majority control of the Senate and House of Representatives. Republicans are increasingly fearful they will lose control of at least the House in November's midterm elections.\"The House isn't going to go Democrat, and neither is the Senate,\" Moreno predicted.Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong, when asked about the crypto bill, said \"there is now a path forward where we can get a win-win-win outcome here: a win for the crypto industry, and a win for the banks, and a win for the American consumer to get President Trump's crypto agenda through to the finish line so we can make America the crypto capital of the world.\"",

Barry Williams | New York Daily News | Getty ImagesThe Trump administration on Wednesday released the rest of the funds it had been withholding for the construction of a major rail tunnel between Manhattan and New Jersey, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul said Wednesday.The federal government freed up the remaining $98 million due for the Gateway project that is increasing passenger rail capacity into Manhattan, as well as an additional $30 million in reimbursements for work that had been completed in January, Hochul said in a statement.The frozen funds were released in tranches over nearly two weeks after a federal judge blocked the Trump administration from withholding the money for the project that began construction in 2023. In compliance with that Feb. 6 order, the administration released $30 million on Feb. 13, followed by an additional $77 million earlier this week.The funding suspension, initiated on the eve of the Oct. 1 government shutdown, this month triggered a total work stoppage that threatened nearly 1,000 employees' jobs.Contractors are now being told to prepare to resume construction next week, the Democratic governor said in Wednesday's statement.\"Today's progress is significant, but we need certainty that Gateway funding will remain in place for the duration of the project,\" Hochul said. \"The federal government has a legal obligation to fully fund Gateway, and New York will accept nothing less.\"Read more CNBC politics coverageBillionaire Les Wexner's congressional deposition over Jeffrey Epstein ties is underwayTrump administration sued for Stonewall Pride flag removal in New YorkPotomac River sewage spill: Trump says Democrats need to ask for his helpStephen Colbert says CBS blocked James Talarico interview from airJust two days earlier, President Donald Trump had slammed the project as a \"future boondoggle,\" claiming in a Truth Social post that it will cost \"many BILLIONS OF DOLLARS more than projected or anticipated.\"The federal government will not be responsible for any cost overruns associated with the $16 billion project, Trump asserted. In the same post, he denied reports that he had offered to release Gateway's federal funding on the condition that New York's Penn Station be renamed after himself. The station is named for its builder and original occupant — the Pennsylvania Railroad.\"These funds should never have been withheld in the first place,\" said New York Attorney General Letitia James, who had sued the Trump administration in conjunction with New Jersey acting Attorney General Jennifer Davenport.\"I am thrilled that hardworking New Yorkers can now get back on the job and move forward with the most important infrastructure project in the country,\" James said in a press release. \"We will remain vigilant to ensure this funding continues uninterrupted, so that workers and commuters are never again left in limbo by the president's targeted and unlawful whims.\"The Hudson River tunnel project is the most important piece of the Gateway program, which aims to renovate a slew of public infrastructure in New York and New Jersey.The existing rail tunnel, known as the North River Tunnel, carries 200,000 passengers under the Hudson every day. It was constructed 116 years ago and was in need of repair even before 2012's Superstorm Sandy significantly damaged it, officials say.The Gateway project would fix the existing tunnel and create a new rail tunnel with two tracks connecting to Penn Station. The federal government and New York and New Jersey are funding the tunnel project. Amtrak has also committed over $1 billion to the project.",

Nathan Laine | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesNEW DELHI — More than 50% of enterprises' current software could be replaced by AI, the CEO of Mistral AI told CNBC on Wednesday, potentially adding to investor concerns over software stocks.The comments by Arthur Mensch, CEO of Mistral AI, come after a sell-off in major software names that was sparked in part by Anthropic's Cowork product as investors grow increasingly worried that AI can do more of what current enterprise software does. Investors fear AI could eat into so-called software as a service, or SaaS, business models. The iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF, which counts names such as Microsoft and Salesforce among its top holdings, is down more than 20% this year. In India, major software stocks like Tata Consultancy Services and Infosys have also fallen. \"I would say more than half of what's currently being bought by IT in terms of SaaS is going to shift to AI,\" Mensch told CNBC at the India Accelerates event on the sidelines of the AI Impact Summit in New Delhi, India. \"AI is making us able to develop software at the speed of light,\" Mensch added.watch nowThe Mistral CEO said as long as enterprises have the \"right infrastructure in place\" they're able to connect their data to AI systems to create applications to run certain parts of work.\"Then we do see with our customers ... in a couple of days, we can create fully custom applications to run a workflow, to run a procurement workflow, or to run supply chain workflows, for instance, in a way where I would say five years ago, you would actually need a vertical SaaS.\" Mensch said there is a \"replatforming\" taking place where businesses are looking to use more AI instead of current SaaS. \"The replatforming is a big opportunity for us, because we now have more than 100 enterprise customers coming to us also with that will of maybe changing and replatforming their IT system, so maybe getting rid of certain things that they bought 20 years ago, and that is starting to be a bit expensive,\" Mensch said. \"They see AI as a way to replatform the thing so that it becomes more efficient and less costly.\"Mensch said software focused on systems of records \"are not going to change,\" however. This type of software is responsible for data within an organization and often works in tandem with AI. Bipul Sinha, CEO of Rubrik, has similar views to Mensch. In an interview on Wednesday with CNBC, Sinha said \"workflow software\" could be \"significantly disrupted by AI.\" However, system of record or data infrastructure software that is enabling AI, \"will be a positive.\" Mistral expansion in IndiaMensch also told CNBC that the company plans to open its first office in India this year as it expands into a market that global tech giants are all trying to get a slice of. Mistral is currently working with international companies that have a footprint in India but is now \"prospecting\" potential customers based in the country in both the public and private sectors.While Mistral is building data centers in Europe, the approach will be different in India, with the company planning to partner with companies that already have a physical infrastructure footprint in the country, Mensch said.The Indian government is pushing AI firms to create models that can run locally with data stored domestically. India also has various languages such as Hindi and Punjabi which Mistral said its large language models are able to accommodate. \"That's something that down the line will be super important for the Indian consumer market,\" Mensch said. watch now",

Jonathan Ernst | ReutersDivided Federal Reserve officials at their January meeting indicated that further interest rate cuts should be paused for now and could resume later in the year only if inflation cooperates.While the decision to hold the central bank's benchmark rate steady mostly was met with approval, the path ahead appeared less certain, with members conflicted between fighting inflation and supporting the labor market, according to minutes released Wednesday from the Jan. 27-28 Federal Open Market Committee meeting.\"In considering the outlook for monetary policy, several participants commented that further downward adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate would likely be appropriate if inflation were to decline in line with their expectations,\" the meeting summary said.However, meeting participants disagreed on where policy should head, with officials debating over whether the focus should be more on fighting inflation or supporting the labor market.\"Some participants commented that it would likely be appropriate to hold the policy rate steady for some time as the Committee carefully assesses incoming data, and a number of these participants judged that additional policy easing may not be warranted until there was clear indication that the progress of disinflation was firmly back on track,\" the minutes said.Moreover, some even entertained the notion that rate hikes could be on the table and wanted the post-meeting statement to more closely reflect \"a two-sided description of the Committee's future interest rate decisions.\"Such a description would have reflected \"the possibility that upward adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate could be appropriate if inflation remains at above-target levels.\"The Fed reduced its benchmark borrowing rate by three-quarters of a percentage point in consecutive cuts in September, October and December. Those moves put the key rate in a range between 3.5%-3.75%.The meeting was the first for a new voting cast of regional presidents, at least two of whom, Lorie Logan of Dallas and Beth Hammack of Cleveland, have publicly said they think they Fed should be on hold indefinitely. Both have said they see inflation as a continuing threat and should be the focus of policy now. All 19 governors and regional presidents participate at the meeting, but only 12 vote.With the Fed already split along ideological lines, the fissure could grow deeper if former Governor Kevin Warsh is confirmed as the next central bank chair. Warsh has spoken in favor of lower rates, a position also supported by current Governors Stephen Miran and Christopher Waller. Both Waller and Miran voted against the January decision, preferring instead another quarter-point cut. Current Chair Jerome Powell's term ends in May.The meeting minutes do not identify individual participants and featured an array of characterizations to describe positions, rotating between \"some,\" \"a few,\" \"many\" and even featured two rare references to \"a vast majority.\"Participants generally expected inflation to come down through the year, \"though the pace and timing of this decline remained uncertain.\" They noted the impact tariffs were having on prices and said they expected the impact to wane as the year goes by.\"Most participants, however, cautioned that progress toward the Committee's 2 percent objective might be slower and more uneven than generally expected and judged that the risk of inflation running persistently above the Committee's objective was meaningful,\" the document said.At the meeting, the rate-setting FOMC adjusted some of the language in its post-meeting statement. The changes noted that the risks to inflation and the labor market had come more closely into balance, softening prior worries over the employment picture.Since the meeting, labor data has been a mixed bag, with indications that private sector job creation is slowing further and that the meager growth is coming almost entirely from the health-care sector. However, the unemployment rate dipped to 4.3% in January and nonfarm payroll growth was stronger than expected.On inflation, the Fed's key personal consumption expenditures prices metric has been mired around 3%. However, a report last week showed that the consumer price index when excluding food and energy prices was at its lowest in nearly five years.Futures traders are placing the best bet for the next cut to come in June, with another in September or October, according to the CME Group's FedWatch gauge.",

    "body": "Donald Trump Jr. (L) and Eric Trump speaking on Squawk on the Street on Feb. 18, 2026.CNBCSince the dollar was created in 1792, U.S. presidents and their families have generally been content with the status quo of effectively giving the national government a monopoly on issuing currency and outlawing the use of foreign currency.Consider the launch of the dollar the country's Initial Coin Offering. Back when the U.S. government was hustling to surpass the dominance of the Spanish pieces of eight then in common circulation throughout the country.When presidents have said anything about the dollar itself, it was generally to reiterate the U.S. government's \"strong dollar\" policy.That continued more or less uninterrupted through 46 presidencies  — until last March, when a company partly owned by President Donald Trump and his family began to market an alternative to the dollar, a cryptocurrency dubbed \"USD1.\"Now, the president's two oldest sons are telling CNBC on the sidelines of a day-long crypto event they hosted why that should change.Marketed as a stablecoin, USD1's value would track the dollar, much as the dollar when it was created in 1792 was initially pegged to the value of the then-dominant Spanish silver dollar.The Trumps' company, World Liberty Financial, touts USD1 as an improvement on official U.S. currency. The firm's website brands its stablecoin as \"The Dollar. Upgraded.\" And it calls the coin \"still the US dollar, but for a new era.\"On Wednesday, the firm held its first World Liberty Forum at Mar-a-Lago, the club owned by President Trump and operated as his winter White House.The event, coming just before the first anniversary of the release of USD1, brought together financiers, technologists, television personalities, the president of the world soccer organization FIFA and the artist Nicki Minaj.From a Mar-a-Lago ballroom stage beneath an enormous stylized golden eagle sculpture, the message to attendees was that the old U.S. dollar needs to be modernized, that the private sector is the place to drive that innovation, and that stablecoins will help taxpayers by creating structural demand for U.S. government debt.In fact, World Liberty backers argue, the new cryptocurrency they are building is not a threat to the dollar at all, but will help ensure the dollar remains dominant in global crypto finance – because USD1's value is pegged to it.But one big question is why, if the dollar needs modernizing, should that be done by the private sector.Read more CNBC politics coverageBillionaire Les Wexner's congressional deposition over Jeffrey Epstein ties is underwayTrump administration sued for Stonewall Pride flag removal in New YorkPotomac River sewage spill: Trump says Democrats need to ask for his helpStephen Colbert says CBS blocked James Talarico interview from airAnd why should the venture be in the private hands of the president and his family, and not in the hands of the U.S. Treasury.CNBC put those questions to the president's sons, World Liberty Financial's co-founders, Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump, in a small event space just off Mar-a-Lago's swimming pool.\"This is actually going to preserve dollar hegemony,\" Donald Trump Jr. replied.\"There's crypto companies that are the top five buyers in the world,\" he said. \"That's going to actually stabilize the US dollar and do all the things that we need to.\"He argued the federal government — and the big Wall Street banking system — simply aren't nimble or innovative enough to drive the needed changes.\"We're going to lead the way as Americans,\" Eric Trump said. \"You're going to leave that to who, JPMorgan, to do? You're going to leave that to the federal government to do?\"Eric Trump sees Wall Street as overly complacent – and therefore ripe for technological disruption.\"Do you think big banks will actually do this?\" he asked. \"And the reason I say this is, I mean, it's been 50 years, where bankers are working six hours a day. They have a two-hour lunch break. They're typically out of the office at four o'clock in the afternoon.\"Eric and Donald Jr. make it clear the animating force behind their venture is not the inventor's glee at building a better mousetrap or the insider's frustration at legacy companies that can't or won't adapt to the future.Instead, what's driving them is a raw sense of retribution.The Trump brothers see the wider financial system as part of an establishment that unfairly ostracized them after their father left power in 2021, when, after the Jan. 6, 2021, U.S. Capitol riot, the banking system broadly declined to do business with the Trump family.\"You know, we didn't get into crypto because we were on the leading edge,\" Donald Trump Jr. said in an interview Wednesday with CNBC's Sara Eisen. \"We got into it out of necessity. They basically forced us into it.\"Eric Trump told Eisen, \"We were the most cancelled people in the world in 2020, 2021 and it's really great to almost have this retribution where all of a sudden we start pushing an agenda.\"\"Our agenda was to modernize finance, to allow that to never ever, ever happen to anybody again,\" Eric Trump said.Donald Trump Jr. said he concluded that the traditional banking system is a \"Ponzi scheme.\"\"They created this monster,\" Trump Jr. said, pointing to the moment when he claimed \"when you had every big bank in the world, for doing nothing wrong,\" \"debank\" Trump accounts and those of other conservatives, \"just based on the fact that we all wore a hat that said 'Make America Great Again.'\"Eric Trump recalled his father's time out of the White House between presidential terms as a traumatizing period for the family.\"These are commercial buildings, residential buildings, golf courses around the world. These aren't political entities, and they were pulling these accounts from us like we were absolute dogs,\" Eric Trump said.\"We couldn't pay our vendors, we couldn't pay our employees. And so we said, listen, there has to be a better way.\"To Eric Trump, the message is that the Trump family will always counterpunch: When social media companies kicked his father off their platforms, President Trump created his own Truth Social media platform. And when the banking industry declined Trump family business, the family took matters into their own hands.And that's why a president's family, for the first time since 1792, is creating an upgraded American currency.Call it Truth Dollar.",

    "body": "Valerie Plesch | The Washington Post | Getty ImagesEven as the U.S. economy adds jobs and the unemployment rate ticks lower, there are fewer hiring opportunities for college graduates. And yet, high school students remain remarkably optimistic about their future employment prospects.According to a new report by Junior Achievement, 73% of teen survey respondents said the artificial intelligence boom will have a mostly positive effect — or no impact at all — on their ability to get a good job that pays well. Junior Achievement surveyed more than 1,000 teens between the ages of 13 and 17 in January.Of those polled, 68% said they plan to attend college, in line with recent years.Read more CNBC personal finance coverageParents with student debt face deadline to secure affordable repayment, forgivenessSecure 2.0 let employers pair emergency savings and 401(k)s, but few have done soHome sellers start getting lower prices at 70, research shows — here's whyAverage IRS tax refund is up 10.9% so far this season, early filing data showsEarly estimates point to lower Social Security COLA for 2027Senators call for longer Social Security Fairness Act lump-sum payment timelineHere's the inflation breakdown for January 2026 — in one chartAverage tax refund is up 22%, Bessent says — what filers can expect this seasonK-shaped economy looks like 'jaws of a crocodile,' economist says: Here's whyHow EPA 'endangerment finding' repeal could impact your walletMedical emergencies can lead to debt and bankruptcy — even for insured AmericansBigger tax refunds may be coming — but missing key forms could risk an auditHow Social Security Fairness Act payments may affect beneficiaries' taxesCredit card debt tops $1.28 trillion, consistent with 'K-shaped' economy: NY FedHow affordability led to a chasm between stock prices, consumer optimismStudent loan complaints at record high, CFPB finds, but agency omits detailsCNBC's Financial Advisor 100: Best financial advisors, top firms ranked\"It's awesome to see that today's teens are optimistic about the future,\" said Jack Harris, Junior Achievement's CEO. \"In the face of AI, some form of postsecondary education is going to be very necessary,\" he said. \"We just have to be sure we are preparing students in the right way so that optimism doesn't fall flat.\"A mixed jobs pictureRecent data does shows that the labor market is doing well. The U.S. economy added more jobs than expected in January, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The overall unemployment rate edged down to 4.3% — but for younger workers, ages 16 to 24, it's a different story. Among this cohort, the unemployment rate was 9.4% in January. There is a bit of a disconnect between \"teens that are a few years out and those just entering the workforce and having difficulty finding jobs,\" Harris said.Several large employers have said they're eliminating some entry-level positions, thanks in part to the rise of AI. Employers are projecting just a 1.6% increase in hiring for the class of 2026 when compared with the class of 2025, research by the National Association of Colleges and Employers also shows.Of course, some industries are more prone to disruptions than others. Entry-level jobs in technology and finance, for example, are at greater risk largely due to generative artificial intelligence, which can supplant a human's analytical skills, according to a report by Indeed. Alternatively, opportunities in nursing, manufacturing and construction are more insulated, for now, the report found.watch nowFears of an AI-driven, white-collar recession are already prompting a growing share of college-age students to pivot. This year, more chose to get a two-year degree or even shorter-term credential to put greater emphasis on career training and post-college employment. The rising price tag of a four-year education is another significant factor driving more students toward short-term programs, other research shows.  \"It really depends on the student,\" said Jill Desjean, director of policy analysis at the National Association of Student Financial Aid Administrators. \"For some students, they know that this is the path they want to take, that a two-year or four-year degree is just not in the cards for them, for reasons other than cost.\"Correction: This story has been revised to reflect that Junior Achievement surveyed teens between the ages of 13 and 17 in January. A previous version misstated the age range of survey respondents.Subscribe to CNBC on YouTube.",

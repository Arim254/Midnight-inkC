    "body": "An aerial view of homes in a neighborhood on Aug.27, 2025 in San Francisco, California.Justin Sullivan | Getty ImagesWhile the Federal Reserve cut its benchmark interest rate this week, mortgage rates responded by doing just the opposite.The average rate on the 30-year fixed mortgage has jumped 20 basis points since Chairman Jerome Powell announced the cut on Wednesday and held a news conference, according to Mortgage News Daily.This happened the last time the Fed lowered its rate as well, and the reason is pretty simple: the bond market had already priced in a cut, but it didn't like the commentary from Powell.On Tuesday, the average rate on the 30-year fixed had fallen to 6.13%, matching the recent low on Sept. 16, which was the day before the Fed announced its last cut, and marking the lowest level in a year.Then this week, after the Fed said it would reduce rates and Powell answered questions in a news conference, that rate shot up 14 basis points on Wednesday and rose another 6 basis points on Thursday, to 6.33%, an even 20 basis points higher than where it was Tuesday. The last time around in September, the rate on the 30-year fixed mortgage went even higher, to 6.37%.Get Property Play directly to your inboxCNBC's Property Play with Diana Olick covers new and evolving opportunities for the real estate investor, delivered weekly to your inbox.Subscribe here to get access today.\"The market's enthusiasm for 3 Fed rate cuts in 2025 had grown a bit too large for the Fed's liking,\" said Matthew Graham, chief operating officer at Mortgage News Daily, in a client note. \"The market was nearly 100% certain of another cut in December. The Fed was not as certain, and Powell made it a point to say so yesterday. The result is a mild re-set in yields back to levels that are more consistent with a December cut being a solid possibility, but not a full lock.\" The recent drop in rates had caused a run on refinances, with those applications up 111% last week year over year, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association. Lower rates did not, however, move the needle much for potential homebuyers.",

    "body": "Jerome Powell, chairman of the US Federal Reserve, during a news conference following a Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting in Washington, DC, US, on Wednesday, Oct. 29, 2025. Al Drago | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesFederal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell faces if not the most difficult challenge of his time in office at least the trickiest in his final months as head of the all-powerful U.S. central bank.Fresh off his surprisingly tough talk Wednesday on the potential for another interest rate cut in December, Powell will have to steer his way through a suddenly contentious atmosphere among policymakers that will make whichever direction the Fed chooses divisive.While it's not the existential economic threat posed by the Covid pandemic in 2020, it nevertheless indicates a level of peril uncommon for the institution.\"December could get messy,\" Bank of America economist Aditya Bhave said in a client note. \"We still think the Fed won't cut rates again under Chair Powell. But barring a clear signal in either direction from the data, the December decision will likely be even more contentious than October.\"The Fed on Wednesday approved a widely anticipated quarter percentage point rate reduction that took its benchmark rate down to 3.75%-4%. However, Powell warned that another cut in December \"is not a foregone conclusion,\" something the market was not expecting.While Wall Street economists and strategists were split over whether the committee will in fact approve another reduction at the Dec. 9-10 meeting, they were in agreement that this is a pivotal moment for Powell and the legacy he ultimately will leave when his term runs out in May.\"Even in a situation without much additional data due to the shutdown, it can actually make sense to push against market pricing to keep optionality going forward,\" wrote Michael Gapen, chief U.S. economist at Morgan Stanley. \"A 95% probability assigned to a December cut does not seem consistent with a data-dependent Fed.\"Markets reactFor their part, traders weren't buying the hawkish rhetoric. Fed fund futures pricing Thursday still indicated a 75% probability of a cut in December, though that was down from around 90% the day before, according to the CME Group's FedWatch.But Powell went to great lengths in his post-meeting news conference Wednesday to dispel the notion that the reduction, which would be the third since September, is a slam dunk.The thrust of his argument was multi-pronged: What data there is available during the government shutdown blackout has largely showed a stable economy though the labor market is a risk; inflation is still above target; and, in an unusual development, there are \"strongly differing\" views on the FOMC for where policy should move.Markets were clearly caught off guard by the move, with stocks slipping and Treasury yields surging. The 10-year Treasury yield was solidly above 4% Thursday while the policy-sensitive 2-year note climbed over 3.6% to its highest level in about a month.\"The reaction of the bond market should certainly give Fed officials pause,\" wrote Ed Yardeni, head of Yardeni Research and coiner of the term \"bond vigilantes\" to describe buyers' strikes in the fixed income markets. \"The bond market isn't buying the Fed's cover story that interest rates were too restrictive.\"For Powell, the statement regarding December was an unusual step considering markets had been expecting a more neutral tone. Asked whether he was bothered by the strong anticipation of another cut, Powell said markets should take his statement that a reduction \"is not a foregone conclusion\" should be \"taken on board.\"\"You've got get right in front of that, because you don't want to surprise the market a couple weeks down the road. Now is the time to do it,\" said Dan North, senior economist for North America at Allianz Trade. \"He doesn't usually use words quite so forcefully. So that was interesting, and he's clearly trying to squash speculation about December. We feel the same way, December is going to be a pause.\"Political overhangThe developments come at a ticklish time for the Fed.Powell, a favorite target for President Donald Trump's criticism, has only seven months or so left in his term. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has been busy interviewing potential successors — among them current Governors Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman, both of whom voted in favor of the cut.In addition, Governor Stephen Miran, a hand-picked Trump appointee who will only serve through January, again dissented from the vote in favor of a half-point.At the other end of the spectrum, Kansas City Fed President Jeffrey Schmid voted \"no\" as well, but because he wanted to not cut. Between them run a range of views on the normally consensus-driven FOMC.Whether Powell's tip of the hat to the doves reflects merely a courtesy or deeper misgivings about cuts will be central to Fed analysis in the coming weeks.\"While the press conference played out somewhat differently than we expected, we have not changed our Fed forecast and continue to see a December cut as quite likely,\" Goldman Sachs economist David Mericle wrote. \"We suspect that there is substantial opposition on the FOMC to the risk management cuts and that Powell thought it was important to voice other participants' concerns today in his press conference. But we still think that the arguments for a December cut remain intact.\"",

Analysts polled by StreetAccount had expected $32.42 billion, or growth of 18.1% from a year earlier. Operating income rose 9% from a year ago to $11.4 billion, also beating estimates and accounting for about two-thirds of Amazon's total operating profit. AWS is the world's top provider of cloud infrastructure, but it's facing intensifying pressure from competitors Google and Microsoft, which also reported quarterly results this week.Google's cloud revenue increased 34% during the third quarter, while Microsoft Azure recorded growth of 40%.Amazon's earnings report comes a little over a week after AWS experienced an extended outage that lasted more than 15 hours, taking down numerous websites. Microsoft was hit with outages in its Azure cloud and 365 services on Wednesday, hours before its scheduled earnings release.Amazon officially opened its $11 billion AI data center called Project Rainier on Wednesday. The facility, first announced last year, is intended to train and run models from Claude creator Anthropic. Amazon, which has invested $8 billion in Anthropic, said the startup will use 1 million of its custom Trainium2 chips by the end of 2025.The new data center could help Amazon battle the perception that it's missing out on a flurry of highly lucrative artificial intelligence deals for cloud services. Anthropic and Google deepened their cloud partnership last week in a deal worth tens of billions of dollars, while Meta has inked hefty cloud deals with Google and Oracle in recent months.WATCH: Amazon's $11 billion data center in Indiana goes livewatch now",

Reddit generated international third-quarter sales of $105 million, ahead of the $104 million that StreetAccount projected.Reddit's \"Other revenue\" category, which includes the company's data licensing business, rose 7% year-over-year to $36 million. Google and OpenAI are the some of Reddit's biggest data licensing partners.The company said global daily active uniques for the third quarter grew 19% year-over-year to 116 million, surpassing analyst estimates of 114 million.Reddit's logged-in DAUq for the U.S., its most lucrative region, rose 7% year-over-year to 23.1 million during the third quarter. That was slower than the 12% year-over-year jump Reddit recorded during the second quarter when logged-in DAUq for the U.S. was 22.9 million. This the fifth quarter in a row in which the company sees its U.S. logged-in user growth slow.The company's third-quarter global logged-in DAUq rose 14% year over year to 50.2 million, while its global logged-out DAUq jumped 24% to 65.8 million.Investors have been watching for any changes to Reddit's user growth amid Google increasingly debuting generative AI features like AI Overview, which provides summaries to search questions. Reddit has seen a wave of users come to its platform from Google, and the social media company makes more advertising-related money from users who create accounts.Reddit CEO Steve Huffman told analysts on Thursday that the company is not currently seeing any major traffic from AI-powered chat apps.\"I'm looking forward to continuing to work on these things with these partners, but they're not a major traffic driver today,\" he said. \"But I think there's plenty of opportunity there as we continue to work together.\"In response to an analyst's question about how Reddit plans to convince more people to create accounts and routinely use its app, Huffman reiterated previous comments about improving the platform's user experience.The company is working on \"making sure there are no barriers\" preventing users from seeing relevant content based on their interests, Huffman said.\"The biggest driver of retention is following subreddits that are relevant to your interests,\" he said. \"It's not rocket science.\"Reddit Chief Operating Officer Jen Wong said that the company is increasingly running performance-marketing campaigns intended to attract more users, particularly those overseas, who may not be aware of the platform. Although the company has not historically relied on marketing to obtain new users, Wong said the promotions will help in countries \"where our awareness and consideration is lower than in the U.S., because we're newer.\"\"We saw an increase in Reddit app installs as a result of a brand campaign, which I think is good,\" Wong said. \"And we saw movement in brand awareness and consideration, which I think was also positive and provides a foundation for performance later.\"Google and Meta both reported their third-quarter earnings on Wednesday in which both tech giants surpassed Wall Street expectations.WATCH: Looking to see if Meta AI can reach consumer scale.watch now",

    "body": "A Honda sedan moves down the assembly line on Jan. 28, 2025 at the automaker's assembly plant in Marysville, Ohio. Michael Wayland / CNBCGlobal automakers are once again bracing for production disruptions due to a potential shortage of automotive semiconductor chips, this time sparked by the Dutch government amid geopolitical tensions between the U.S. and China.Honda Motor became the first known automaker this week to reduce production due to the problem that involves chips from Netherlands supplier Nexperia, which is owned by Chinese company Wingtech Technology Co.The industry was hopeful that a meeting this week between President Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping in Asia would provide some relief, but no resolution on the chips issue has been announced.Volkswagen on Thursday reportedly said it has until at least next week before its supplies impact production, while other major automakers have said they are monitoring the situation around the clock, attempting to mitigate disruptions.\"The chip situation from Nexperia, we have a cross-functional 'war room' in the building where I'm sitting that has this as [a] primary job,\" Stellantis CEO Antonio Filosa told investors during a quarterly call Thursday. \"And every day we are pushing actions and projects to extend our period. There is a day-by-day management of what is an industrywide global issue.\"U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping shake hands as they depart following a bilateral meeting at Gimhae Air Base on October 30, 2025 in Busan, South Korea. Andrew Harnik | Getty ImagesSuch \"war rooms\" have become a regular practice in the automotive industry amid supply chain disruptions, which have become more common since the Covid pandemic rattled production and deliveries of many parts, including chips, starting in 2020.Several automotive industry insiders confirmed to CNBC that war rooms have been established in their companies, as they look into alternative purchasing methods. They included working with major suppliers in an attempt to find alternative sources as well as buying on the open market.\"Suppliers across the motor vehicle industry are working to understand the potential effects on production and supply continuity,\" MEMA, the largest vehicle supplier association in the U.S., said in an emailed statement. \"Chips and diodes are foundational to automotive components and systems, from infotainment systems to door handles, to steering and braking. Even the absence of a single diode or chip can disrupt the manufacture of vehicles.\" NexperiaThe situation involving Nexperia began late last month, when the Dutch government took control of the company, in what was seen as a highly unusual move, reportedly after the U.S. raised security concerns.In making the decision, the Dutch government cited fears that tech from the company — which specializes in the high-volume production of chips used in automotive, consumer electronics and other industries — \"would become unavailable in an emergency.\"China responded by blocking exports of the firm's finished products, sparking alarm in Europe's auto industry.German automakers are especially sensitive to Nexperia-related disruptions because they rely heavily on large, domestic suppliers, known as \"Tier 1s,\" and local production facilities and companies, such as Nexperia, despite much of its manufacturing moving to China.The European Automobile Manufacturers' Association said this week that carmakers were close to closing production lines because of the chip shortage, which comes four years after a shortage of such parts amid the coronavirus pandemic.A close-up view of the Nexperia plant sign in Newport, Wales on April 1, 2022. Matthew Horwood | Getty Images News | Getty Images\"This means assembly line stoppages might only be days away. We urge all involved to redouble their efforts to find a diplomatic way out of this critical situation,\" ACEA Director General Sigrid de Vries said in a statement.The chips affected are legacy semiconductors used in basic vehicle functions such as windshield wipers and window controls — parts that lack sufficient alternative sources, according to S&P Global Mobility.A Nexperia spokesman referred to a previous statement from the company, which summarized the ongoing situation and said it is seeking an exemption from the export restrictions and working to mitigate the impacts of the decision.A Wingtech spokesperson on Thursday condemned the Dutch government's actions, saying the company \"will robustly defend its rights and use every legal avenue to do so.\"\"Only by restoring full control and ownership rights to the company's rightful shareholders and management, and by ceasing political interference in corporate governance, can the Dutch government begin to repair the damage to its reputation, de-escalate international tension, and safeguard its own and European economic security,\" the spokesperson said via an emailed statement.Fluid situationHonda's production cuts impacts include all of its main North American plants, including large vehicle assembly and supporting facilities across the U.S., Canada and Mexico.\"We are currently managing an industrywide semiconductor supply chain issue, making strategic adjustments to production as necessary to carefully manage the available supply of parts and meet the needs of our customers,\" Honda said Thursday in an emailed statement, calling it a \"fluid\" situation.The impacts are expected to continue to spread to other automakers if a resolution is not found.Ford Motor CEO Jim Farley last week said the chip problem was at the forefront of conversations when he made a trip to Washington, D.C, earlier this month. He called it a \"political issue,\" saying the company is working with the U.S. and China administrations to resolve it.\"It's an industrywide issue. A quick breakthrough is really necessary to avoid fourth-quarter production losses for the entire industry,\" said Farley, adding that automakers have gotten \"really good\" at maximizing component purchases such as chips following the crisis in 2021.General Motors CEO Mary Barra made similar comments last week, calling it an \"industry issue\" that will hopefully be resolved soon.\"While this has the potential to impact production, we have teams working around the clock with our supply chain partners to minimize possible disruptions. The situation is very fluid and we will provide updates throughout the quarter as appropriate,\" she said during the company's quarterly earnings call.Other automotive executives from Volvo, Mercedes-Benz and more have also shared similar thoughts with investors and the media.\"This is a politically induced situation ... which means that the solution to this, or the resolution to this, resides in the political space, primarily between the United States and China, in this case, with Europe kind of caught in the middle,\" Mercedes-Benz CEO Ola Källenius said Wednesday during an earnings call.",

At least five Wall Street analysts have cut their price targets for the stock after the report, anticipating investors' displeasure with the burrito chain's shrinking traffic and gloomy outlook.\"It's difficult to call a bottom for sales given the multitude of factors weighing on demand,\" Citi analyst Jon Tower wrote in a research note, revising his price target from $54 to $44 per share.In the third quarter, Chipotle's same-store sales rose 0.3%, but the chain's traffic fell. While many restaurant chains have suffered in recent years as diners wracked by inflation eat out less, analysts were unsure if the chain's value perception contributed to Chipotle's issues. While its burritos and bowls average about $10, consumers often assume its average prices are closer to the $15 entrees of its fast-casual peers, executives said on the conference call.\"While we knew that traffic had slowed for Chipotle into the fall, we were surprised by the magnitude that was reported last night and the resulting deleverage this produced,\" BTIG analyst Pete Saleh wrote in a note. \"We're admittedly perplexed by how suddenly this traffic weakness came about, and not convinced affordability concerns are the main driver here.\"watch nowCEO Scott Boatwright said on Wednesday's earnings conference call that diners are visiting less frequently, particularly those between the ages of 25 and 35 years old, a key demographic for the company. Same-store sales have worsened so far in October, and the company is now projecting that sales at restaurants open at least a year will shrink in the fourth quarter and fall by a low-single digit percentage for the full year.\"We are very concerned that the menu and marketing actions taken so far have not sufficiently offset the traffic retraction,\" Bernstein analyst Danilo Gargiulo said.Still, most analysts attributed the slowdown to industrywide challenges, not company-specific issues that Chipotle needs to address. Unemployment, increased student loan repayments and slower real wage growth accounting for inflation are weighing on consumers' spending, according to Boatwright.\"We believe the brand remains fundamentally healthy (stable share of customer restaurant wallet) and expect a return to growth as the macro improves,\" Bank of America Securities analyst Sara Senatore wrote in a note to clients.Chipotle's weak performance bodes poorly for its fast-casual peers, like Sweetgreen and Cava. Morgan Stanley analyst Brian Harbour called fast-casual restaurants \"This Season's Halloween Scare\" in his research note covering Chipotle's earnings report.Shares of Sweetgreen fell 6% in trading Thursday, while Cava stock was down 8%. Both are slated to report their third-quarter results next week.Correction: The company is now projecting that sales at restaurants open at least a year will fall by a low-single digit percentage for the full year. An earlier version misstated the percentage move.",

Kylie Cooper | ReutersBusinesses that contract with the federal government lost $12 billion in the first four weeks of the government shutdown, according to a report from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce released Thursday.The report, which the Chamber is sending to members of Congress, shows that 65,500 small businesses across the United States are losing around $3 billion per week from the shutdown.Companies affected by the shutdown include providers of high-tech machinery, office supplies, and landscaping services, according to the report, which was shared with CNBC before its public release.Maryland and Virginia have the most government contractors at risk from the shutdown, according to the report.But other states, including Alabama, California, Florida, and Texas, also have significant numbers of companies that have seen contracting revenue dry up since the shutdown began Oct.1\"For many of these small businesses, federal contracts represent a sizable portion of their overall revenue,\" Neil Bradley, executive vice president and chief policy officer at the Chamber of Commerce, said in a letter attached to the report.Bradley noted that although federal employees are entitled to back pay under the law when they return to work after a shutdown, contractors have no such legal protections.\"When the government reopens, rarely are contractors made whole,\" he added. \"The purchase of many goods may only be delayed by a government shutdown, though some are permanently forgone.\"Read more CNBC government shutdown coverage Government shutdown could cost U.S. economy up to $14 billion, CBO saysJudge extends ban on Trump firing federal workers during government shutdownStates sue Trump admin to keep SNAP benefits during government shutdownLargest federal worker union urges end to government shutdownTrump's $130 million mystery military donor is Timothy Mellon: NYTGovernment shutdown becomes second-longest in U.S. historyStates sue Trump administration to keep SNAP benefits Government shutdown becomes 2nd longest in U.S. historyHow to get student loan help during the government shutdownWhite House economic advisor Hassett says shutdown could end this weekArmy Corps of Engineers pausing $11 billion in projects over shutdown: VoughtGovernment shutdown: Trump distrust keeps Democrats from forming 'gang'Bill to fund military during government shutdown fails in Senate procedural voteBradley called on Congress to pass a short-term spending bill to reopen the government.\"We also urge Congress to consider ways to help make federal contractors, especially small business contractors, whole,\" he wrote.A Republican-sponsored House stopgap funding bill has been voted on 13 times in the Senate. But each time, the bill has fallen short of the 60 votes needed to pass, as Democrats hold out for an agreement to extend enhanced Affordable Care Act premium tax credits that are set to end this year.Some of the lost funding to contractors is expected to be made up once the government reopens, according to a Congressional Budget Office report.But the same report calculated that the shutdown so far will result in the loss of at least $7 billion in gross domestic product due to furloughed federal employees working fewer weeks.CBO Director Phillip Swagel told House Budget Committee Chairman Jodey Arrington, R-Texas, in a letter that a six-week-long shutdown would cost the economy $11 billion, and an eight-week-long shutdown would cost $14 billion.",

    "body": "San Francisco Mayor Daniel Lurie speaks during a press conference at San Francisco City Hall on Oct. 23, 2025 in San Francisco, California.Justin Sullivan | Getty ImagesSan Francisco Mayor Daniel Lurie, who was recently thrust into a national debate about the safety of big cities, told CNBC on Thursday that he feels \"pressure every day\" to continue improving conditions for residents. Last week, President Donald Trump reversed plans for a \"federal surge\" in San Francisco. The potential National Guard deployment hit the headlines when Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff told the New York Times that he'd support Trump's call for federal troops to be sent to the city.Benioff's sentiments were supported by Elon Musk and David Sacks, high-profile techies with close ties to the Trump administration. Benioff quickly backtracked as criticism mounted. Unlike California Governor Gavin Newsom, Lurie has tried to avoid clashing with Trump since taking office in January. But he has spoken up to say that the city is progressing on business development and crime, often citing data to back up his claims.In Thursday's interview, Lurie's first on television since the Trump incident, the mayor said there's plenty of hard work ahead.\"I felt that pressure in January, I feel it today,\" Lurie said, when asked about support from tech leaders. \"I think they understand... when San Francisco is strong, America is strong.\" watch nowLurie, a moderate Democrat, pointed to an array of data that show the city is making progress on a post-pandemic comeback, largely driven by the boom in investment and usage of artificial intelligence. CBRE data on venture funding show 2025 is expected to surpass the record reached in 2021, thanks in large part to AI investments in San Francisco and Silicon Valley. In addition, crime rates are down 30% from 2024, as event bookings and tourism are up, residential real estate is becoming more scarce and the office market is getting hot.\"We have a lot of competition out there in the world, and we are on the rise,\" Lurie said. \"Anything that would have hindered that rise is something that we don't need.\"Lurie is also leveraging philanthropic commitments to work with the city in cleaning up streets and supporting small businesses. He shared on CNBC Thursday that the San Francisco Downtown Development Corporation has now raised $50 million for this effort, up from the $40 million at launch. The goal is to spark a comeback, with the help of the tech boom in the city, but one that paves the way for all businesses to thrive, he said.\"What we're trying to build here is a broad-based recovery at City Hall,\" Lurie said. \"Our job is to create the conditions so that not only these [tech] companies can succeed, but our restaurants and small businesses can succeed. We're stripping away red tape. We're telling everybody that we're open for business. We want you here, and we want you to be part of the community.\" ",

Kena Betancur | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesApple reported fiscal-fourth quarter earnings on Thursday that beat analyst expectations, and provided a strong forecast for the company's December quarter.  Shares of the iPhone maker rose in extended trading.Here's how Apple did versus LSEG consensus estimates for the quarter ending Sept. 27: EPS: $1.85 vs. $1.77 estimated  Revenue: $102.47 billion vs. $102.24 billion estimated  Here's how Apple's main business lines did versus consensus estimates:  iPhone revenue: $49.03 billion vs. $50.19 billion estimated  Mac revenue: $8.73 billion vs. $8.59 billion estimated  iPad revenue: $6.95 billion vs. $6.98 billion estimated  Other Products revenue: $9.01 billion vs. $8.49 billion estimated  Services revenue: $28.75 billion vs. $28.17 billion estimated   Apple CEO Tim Cook told CNBC's Steve Kovach that revenue in the current quarter will increase by at least 10%.\"We expect total company revenue to grow by 10 to 12% year over year, we expect iPhone revenue to grow double digits, year over year, and we expect that that would make the December quarter the best ever in the history of the company,\" Cook said. Analysts polled by LSEG expect Apple to guide to $132.31 billion in December quarter sales and earnings of $2.53 per share. Apple's guide surpasses those expectations. With 11% growth over last year's December quarter, revenue for the upcoming period would be $137.97 billion.Cook said that Apple was confident in its guidance because of the strong reception for the company's new iPhone 17 devices, released in September, which he said was \"off the chart.\"  \"We look at the results to date, the reception of the consumer on the very strong iPhone lineup,\" Cook said. \"We're looking at traffic in our stores, which is up significantly year on year. We see enthusiasm around the world.\"The company had $27.46 billion in net income during the quarter versus $14.29 billion in the year-ago period, which was lower because of a one-time tax charge.  For Apple's fiscal 2025, it had $416 billion in total revenue, a 6% increase over 2024. Sales in the September quarter rose 8% on an annual basis. watch nowOverall iPhone revenue was up 6% to $49.03 billion, the first sign of how iPhone 17 sales are faring. Apple's newest phones went on sale on Sept. 19, so there is just over a week of sales in this quarter. However, LSEG analysts were looking for $50.19 billion in iPhone sales for the period.  Cook said that several iPhone models were supply constrained during the quarter — both for the iPhone 17 and last year's iPhone 16 models. \"Currently, we're supply constrained on several models of the iPhone 17,\" Cook said.Apple's iPad business was also flat during the quarter, with $6.95 billion in sales. Apple didn't release a new model during the quarter, but it introduced an upgraded iPad Pro with an updated M5 chip in October. The company's services business, which includes online subscriptions such as iCloud,  Apple Music, as well as App Store fees, Google search licensing, payment fees, and AppleCare warranties for hardware, grew 15% to $24.97 billion in sales. The unit is Apple's fastest-growing and important for investors because it represents recurring revenue with a higher profit margin than hardware.  Cook said that most of the components in the Services business were seeing accelerating growth.  \"It was a run of the table,\" Cook said. Apple CFO Kevan Parekh said on an earnings call with analysts that Apple expects similar Services growth in the current quarter.Other Products, a category that includes Apple Watch, AirPods and Vision Pro, declined very slightly during the quarter with sales of $9.04 billion.  Apple's Mac business showed strong 13% growth to $8.72 billion in sales. Cook attributed the growth to strong sales of the company's MacBook Air laptop, which were refreshed in March alongside a $100 price cut, lowering its starting price to $999.  The company's sales in Greater China, which includes Hong Kong and Taiwan, fell 4% on an annual basis to $14.5 billion in sales.\"We expect China to return to growth this quarter because of the reception of the iPhone there, or the iPhone 17 family,\" Cook said.  Cook said that the company still plans to release an updated version of Siri next year, and said that there were more forthcoming partnerships like the company's agreement to integrate OpenAI's ChatGPT into Apple Intelligence.  \"Our intention is to integrate with more people over time,\" Cook said.  Cook said that Apple had not changed its prices in response to Trump administration tariffs. Parekh said the company incurred $1.1 billion in additional costs related to tariffs during the September quarter. He said Apple expects $1.4 billion in tariff costs on an earnings call with analysts in the December quarter, and that the company's gross margin would be between 47% and 48%.\"We held the pricing that we would have done without any tariffs, and we're just absorbing the tariffs in gross margin,\" Cook said. Apple's gross margin was 47.2%, better than LSEG expectations of 46.4%.  WATCH: If you are an Apple investor, this is a 'pound the table moment'watch now",

    "body": "SpaceX's Starship rocket 38 launches during the 11th test flight on October 13, 2025 as seen from South Padre Island in Texas.Gabriel V. Cardenas | Afp | Getty ImagesSpaceX said it has pitched NASA a \"simplified mission\" to put astronauts back on the moon following criticisms over delays by Sean Duffy, the space agency's acting administrator.In a company blog post out Thursday, Elon Musk's aerospace and defense contractor said: \"We've shared and are formally assessing a simplified mission architecture and concept of operations that we believe will result in a faster return to the Moon while simultaneously improving crew safety.\" Earlier this month, Duffy said in an interview on CNBC's Squawk Box, that SpaceX was behind schedule on building its lunar landing system for NASA's Artemis III mission and that the agency would reopen the landing contract for that mission to competitors such as Jeff Bezos' rocket maker Blue Origin.A NASA spokesperson in an email to CNBC said that the agency \"has received and is evaluating plans from both SpaceX and Blue Origin for acceleration of HLS production.\" \"Following the shutdown, the agency will issue an RFI to the broader aerospace industry for their proposals,\" the spokesperson said. \"A committee of NASA subject matter experts is being assembled to evaluate each proposal and determine the best path forward to win the second space race given the urgency of adversarial threats to peace and transparency on the Moon.\"NASA had previously said that SpaceX and Blue Origin would have until Oct. 29th to propose new ways to speed up the project.Musk initially responded to Duffy by posting to his social network X, \"Sean Dummy is trying to kill NASA!\" In another post, Musk wrote: \"The person responsible for America's space program can't have a 2 digit IQ.\"SpaceX's massive Starship has flown 11 test flights so far, uncrewed. The last two flights were deemed successful, but the company has not yet shown all the in-orbit refueling capabilities it requires before embarking on the Artemis III, manned lunar mission.Blue Origin has been developing a lunar lander for NASA and has received about $835 million from the space agency since their contract began in 2023. The company plans to launch a smaller scale version of their lander, known as Blue Moon Mark 1.Meanwhile, China is aiming to land its astronauts on the moon by the end of the decade.In September, in an all-hands meetings with NASA employees, Duffy told his staff that he was irked by \"shade thrown\" on the space agency at a Senate hearing in which some attendees doubted that the U.S. could put astronauts back on the Moon before China could land its astronauts there.Besides its lunar mission, China also announced it is sending a new crew to its orbiting lab, the Tiangong space station, this week. China built this space station after it was excluded from access to the International Space Station due to U.S. national security concerns.SpaceX is paid when it achieves different milestones under its NASA contract for the HLS (human landing system integrated lander).According to USA Spending, which tracks federal contracts, NASA has already paid approximately $2.7 billion to SpaceX for the \"design, development, manufacture, test, launch, demonstration and engineering support\" of the HLS. The agency is obligated to pay around another $300 million for milestones SpaceX achieved, and Musk's company stands to earn a total of $4.5 billion (or another $1.5 billion) from the HLS contract if they achieve all milestones.SpaceX today said, in their company blog post, that they \"self-funded\" 90% or more of the program, which would imply they have spent over $30 billion already.As CNBC previously reported, some NASA employees have been required to work without pay for the space agency during the federal government shutdown if their jobs support Artemis missions.SpaceX and Blue Origin did not immediately respond to CNBC's requests for comment.",

    "body": "U.S. President Donald Trump prepares to greet Chinese President Xi Jinping ahead of a bilateral meeting at Gimhae Air Base on October 30, 2025 in Busan, South Korea. Andrew Harnik | Getty ImagesAmerican shippers were already unhappy about their business outlook after President Donald Trump imposed steep new tariffs on China in April.And they were not feeling much happier on Thursday, even after Trump announced a new trade truce with Chinese President Xi Jinping.The consensus among U.S. shippers and logistics managers is that the deal is largely rhetoric and that it does not change the substance of the disagreements on trade between the two nations.The note that tariffs on Chinese imports, even after the 10-percentage-point cut announced, remain high enough to put a serious dent on import volume.The effective rate on Chinese imports is still around a minimum of 47% because tariffs are layered on top of each other depending on the physical characteristics of individual imports.Alan Baer, the CEO of the trucking company OL USA, told CNBC on Thursday, \"Uncertainty remains at the forefront of every client conversation as we look out to 2026.\"watch now\"Risk management of inventory levels combined with avoiding tariff variability is a central theme for the first half of 2026,\" Baer said.Before Trump and Xi met in South Korea, the effect of the American president's on-again, off-again tariff threats was seen in U.S. Customs data on containers arriving in the United States from China.\"Apparel has taken the biggest hit so far, with woven apparel down more than 50% and knitted apparel down over 40%,\" said Ben Tracy, vice president of strategic business development at Vizion, which aggregates trade data for logistics managers.\"Furniture and toys show the steepest drops by total volume, falling between 20 to 25%,\" Tracy said on Thursday.New data from Vizion shows that year-to-date, the number of containers shipped from China is 2.9 million, which is 700,000 fewer containers than shipped during the same period in 2024The same data also shows that there are currently 247,000 containers from China on the water headed to the United States. That is about 50,000 fewer containers on the water during the same month in 2024.Fewer containers to ship means lower profits for trucking companies, warehouse firms, and railroads.The markedly lower container volume is reflected in the Logistics Managers' Index, a key metric that tracks inventory levels, warehouse costs, transportation capacity, and pricing.The LMI over the past two months suggests the freight industry might be headed for a recession.LMI authors have said that a negative index trend would need to continue for at least three months it would indicate an actual recession.Jon Gold, vice president of supply chain and customs policy at the National Retail Federation, said that the deal announced by Trump, which cuts so-called fentanyl tariffs on Chinese imports from 20% to 10%, \"certainly provides relief to companies, especially if it leads to further de-escalation of tariffs between the U.S. and China.\"While the tariff rate is still high with the fentanyl and reciprocal tariffs in place, it is a much better alternative we were facing with an additional 100% tariffs,\" Gold said.But he said the remaining tariffs are \"harmful\" and that \"we encourage the administration to continue negotiations with China, as well as other trading partners\" to remove those duties.",

There are 3,800 fewer fully certified controllers than the FAA's target, according to Nick Daniels, president of the National Air Traffic Controllers Association.\"These additional distractions will compound the existing risks in an already strained system,\" Daniels said in an opinion piece in The Hill on Tuesday.\"Every day the shutdown continues, the National Airspace System becomes less safe than it was the day before, as the controllers' focus shifts from their critical safety tasks to their financial uncertainty,\" he said.The shutdown began on Oct. 1 after Senate Republicans and Democrats failed to reach an agreement to keep the government open.Democratic senators are insisting that Republicans agree to extend enhanced Affordable Care Act health insurance subsidies before they will vote for funding to reopen the government.The Congressional Budget Office estimated Wednesday that a four-week shutdown would cost the economy at least $7 billion by the end of 2026. A six-week shutdown would cost the economy $11 billion, and an eight-week shutdown would cost $14 billion, according to CBO estimates.Flights have been delayed at several U.S. airports over the past month but the severe disruptions that preceded the end of the longest-ever shutdown, between late 2018 and early 2019, have not occurred.— CNBC's Leslie Josephs contributed to this report.",

    "body": "watch nowJoe Lonsdale, the founder of venture firm 8VC, says that top executives in artificial intelligence are underselling the resources they need to meet their ambitious goals.These companies are \" afraid to scare their investors, and so they are telling them they need a lot less capital, a lot less energy than they know they actually do,\" Lonsdale, who previously co-founded Palantir, told CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" on Thursday.This dynamic will create a continuous cycle where executives look for more capital and energy every three to six months to power their initiatives, Lonsdale said. Tech giants have ramped up spending on AI in recent months to build out infrastructure and lure top talent. Some skeptics worry that a bubble is forming and that companies are overspending with no clear path to a return on investment.\"If anything I think we're underestimating how much investment is going to go into this space and how much we're going to need,\" Lonsdale said.Meta, Alphabet and Microsoft all bumped up their capital expenditures guidance on Wednesday in their quarterly earnings reports. OpenAI, which is valued at $500 billion on the private market, has been on a historic spending spree of late.Executives have said they're responding to soaring demand for AI tools and services. Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai chalked up the boost in spending to elevated cloud demand, while Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said his company is \"aggressively\" ramping up in the race to superintelligence.Lonsdale said he is focusing on companies creating apps and services that are \"very economic\" and \"profitable.\"\"I'm building a lot of companies in the real economy that are increasing productivity,\" he said.

    "body": "Roblox shares sank 15% on Thursday as the company said it expects increased capital expenditures that could pressure margins.The gaming company said it expects capital expenditures of $468 million, an increase of $158 million from prior guidance.\"Our operating margin could decline slightly year-over-year due to the combination of higher DevEx rates and the impact of infrastructure and safety related investments catching up with rapid bookings growth in the back half of 2025,\" the company said in a letter to shareholders.The company's Developer Exchange Program (DevEx) lets creators exchange Robux for real money.The gaming company's margin and spending comments overshadowed an otherwise strong third-quarter report.Roblox's third-quarter revenue rose 48% year-over-year to $1.36 billion, while bookings surged 70% to $1.92 billion, beating LSEG estimates of $1.65 billion.The company posted a loss of 37 cents per share, which beat analyst expectations for a loss of 49 cents per share.\"Our third-quarter results demonstrate the tremendous progress weʼve made toward our goal of capturing 10% of the global gaming market,\" CEO David Baszucki said in a release.Read more CNBC tech newsGoogle expects 'significant increase' in capital expenditure in 2026, execs sayMeta CEO Mark Zuckerberg defends AI spending: 'We're seeing the returns'Powell says AI is different from dotcom bubble and is major source of economic growthSnowflake says exec shared unauthorized guidance in Instagram street interviewRoblox boosted booking guidance for the fiscal year to between $6.57 billion and $6.62 billion, up from its previous forecast of $5.87 billion to $5.97 billion the quarter before.Average daily users were at 151.5 million, up 70% over the year prior, but average bookings per DAU of $12.68 missed the StreetAccount expectation of $13.24.Rising parental concerns over online gaming and platforms, plus inquiries from lawmakers, have led to a wave of child-safety regulations within the technology sector and pressure on artificial intelligence companies to do more.Roblox is facing multiple lawsuits alleging that the platform enables predators to sexually exploit and abuse underage victims.Baszucki told CNBC's \"Squawk on the Street\" on Thursday that safety was the company's \"top priority\" and it has already put in place several security measures to protect minors on the platform.\"On Roblox, there is no sharing of images, all our text is filtered, and we're really highlighting our commitment to really innovating in this space,\" Baszucki said.Roblox implemented age-verification software in July that uses facial scans to estimate users' ages and place them in an appropriate age group: under 13, over 13, and over 18. Those who are over 13 can then access \"trusted connections,\" a new communication feature that allows users to chat more freely.The company also announced on Wednesday that it would join the Attorney General Alliance in launching a new child safety initiative, dubbed the Partnership for Youth Online Safety, which seeks to establish best practices for designing tech and deterring online child exploitation.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconRoblox year-to-date stock chart.",

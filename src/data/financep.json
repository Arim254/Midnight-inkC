(TSMC), left, and Jensen Huang, chief executive officer of Nvidia Corp., during the TSMC sports day event in Hsinchu, Taiwan, on Saturday, Nov. 8, 2025. Bloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesAsian chip stocks rallied in early trading Thursday after American AI chip darling Nvidia posted strong third quarter earnings, in a sign that AI bubble concerns aren't slowing down the AI industry.  South Korea's SK Hynix popped around 4%. The memory chip maker is Nvidia's top supplier of high-bandwidth memory used in AI applications. Samsung Electronics, which also supplies Nvidia with memory, was up nearly 4%. The company has been working to catch up to SK Hynix in high-bandwidth memory to land more contracts with Nvidia. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, the world's largest contract chipmaker, which produces most of Nvidia's chip designs, rose 4% in Taipei.  Hon Hai Precision Industry — also known as Foxconn, and manufacturer of server racks designed for AI workloads — climbed 3.28%.The Asian chip giants' rally comes after Nvidia's earnings topped Wall Street expectations on Wednesday, with the company providing a stronger-than-expected sales guidance for the fourth quarter.Nvidia's sales and outlook are closely watched by the technology industry as a sign of the health of the AI boom, and its earnings come against the backdrop of recent market fears regarding an AI bubble. However, the company's strong results and forecasts should ease immediate AI bubble concerns, Rolf Bulk, equity research analyst at New Street Research, told CNBC.\"Demand is diversified, with AI-native companies deploying agentic AI solutions, and enterprises increasingly integrating AI across their existing products and services,\" Bulk said. \"We expect Nvidia's results to drive higher earnings estimates across the sector, including for its primary GPU supplier TSMC, memory vendors SK Hynix and Samsung, and the broader Asian subcomponent and assembly value chain,\" he added.In Tokyo, Renesas Electronics, a key Nvidia supplier, added about 4%. Tokyo Electron, which provides essential chipmaking equipment to foundries that manufacture Nvidia's chips, gained 5.87%. Another Japanese chip equipment maker, Lasertec, was up about 6%. Japanese tech conglomerate SoftBank skyrocketed nearly 7%, though the firm recently offloaded its shares of Nvidia. Softbank owns the majority of British semiconductor company Arm, which supplies Nvidia with chip architecture and designs.SoftBank is also involved in a number of AI ventures that use Nvidia's technology, including the $500 billion Stargate project for data centers in the U.S.\"There's been a lot of talk about an AI bubble,\" Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang told investors on an earnings call. \"From our vantage point, we see something very different.\"",

    "body": "Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI (L), and Jensen Huang CEO of Nvidia.ReutersTwo months ago Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman stood side by side in San Jose, California, to announce a historic agreement between the two leaders in artificial intelligence. Nvidia would invest $100 billion over a number of years, starting in 2026, as OpenAI's AI supercomputing facilities come online, the duo said. The timing of the buildouts and the cost of each data center weren't disclosed. But in Nvidia's quarterly financial report on Wednesday, the chipmaker reminded investors that there's a big difference between an announcement and a contract. \"There is no assurance that we will enter into definitive agreements with respect to the OpenAI opportunity or other potential investments, or that any investment will be completed on expected terms,\" Nvidia said in the risk factors section of its quarterly filing.Nvidia has been on an investing binge of late, putting its ever-expanding cash hoard to use, and financially supporting companies that buy its graphics processing units, or GPUs. In addition to the OpenAI arrangement, Nvidia on Wednesday highlighted its $5 billion commitment to invest in Intel during the quarter and its agreement this week to invest up to $10 billion in Anthropic.An OpenAI spokesperson didn't provide a comment but pointed to Huang's statements on the call, including his description of OpenAI as a \"once-in-a-generation company\" and his expectation that the investment will \"translate to extraordinary returns.\"\"There is no assurance that any investment will be completed on expected terms, if at all,\" Nvidia said. The key difference with OpenAI is the scale of the planned investment and the benchmarks that would need to be met for all the money to come through. A source told CNBC at the time of the announcement that an initial $10 billion would be available to OpenAI soon to help the company work towards deploying its first gigawatt of capacity.Altman said recently that OpenAI will end the year on a $20 billion annualized revenue run rate, which is a massive number considering its flagship ChatGPT product is only three years old. Altman said the company expects to reach hundreds of billions of dollars in revenue by 2030. But that figure doesn't come anywhere close to covering the company's expenses. In total, OpenAI has announced roughly $1.4 trillion in infrastructure spending with a number of partners as it seeks to continue building out its AI models and services. To get there, the company is reliant on outside capital. Despite the uncertainty of the September agreement, Nvidia executives continue to sound bullish on the company's work with OpenAI. On Nvidia's earnings call, after the chipmaker reported a solid revenue and earnings beat along with stronger-than-expected guidance, CFO Colette Kress touted OpenAI's growth.\"OpenAI recently shared that their weekly user base has grown to 800 million, enterprise customers has increased to 1 million and that their gross margins were healthy,\" Kress said. She added that the two companies are \"working on a strategic partnership\" and that Nvidia is \"focused on helping them build and deploy at least 10 gigawatts of AI data centers.\"And Huang said, \"Everything that OpenAI does runs on Nvidia today.\"An OpenAI spokesperson didn't provide a comment, but pointed to Huang's commentary on the call, including his description of OpenAI as a \"once-in-a-generation company\" and his expectation that the investment will \"translate to extraordinary returns.\"There's no question that as OpenAI builds out data centers, it will keep spending money on Nvidia's chips. But OpenAI has also partnered with Nvidia rival Advanced Micro Devices, agreeing last month to deploy 6 gigawatts of AMD's Instinct GPUs over multiple years and across multiple generations of hardware, beginning in the second half of next year. The AMD agreement has one critical component that Nvidia's lacks: signatures. As part of the pact, the company has issued OpenAI a warrant for up to 160 million shares of the chipmaker's common stock, with vesting milestones tied to deployment volume and AMD's share price. That agreement was signed on Oct. 5, by AMD CFO Jean Hu and OpenAI CFO Sarah Friar. — CNBC's MacKenzie Sigalos and Ashley Capoot contributed to this report.

    "body": "Yann LeCun, chief AI scientist at Meta, speaks at the Viva Tech conference in Paris, June 13, 2023.Chesnot | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesYann LeCun, known as one of the godfathers of modern artificial intelligence and one of the first AI visionaries to join the company then known as Facebook, is leaving Meta.LuCun said in a LinkedIn post on Wednesday that he plans to create a startup that specializes in a kind of AI technology that researchers have described as world models, analyzing information beyond web data in order to better represent the physical world and its properties. \"I am creating a startup company to continue the Advanced Machine Intelligence research program (AMI) I have been pursuing over the last several years with colleagues at FAIR, at NYU, and beyond,\" LeCun wrote. \"The goal of the startup is to bring about the next big revolution in AI: systems that understand the physical world, have persistent memory, can reason, and can plan complex action sequences.\"Meta will partner with LeCun's startup.The departure comes at a time of disarray within Meta's AI unit, which was dramatically overhauled this year after the company released the fourth version of its Llama open-source large language model to a disappointing response from developers. That spurred CEO Mark Zuckerberg to spend billions of dollars recruiting top AI talent, including a June $14.5 billion investment in Scale AI to lure the startup's 28-year-old CEO Alexandr Wang, now Meta's new chief AI officer.LeCun, 65, joined Facebook in 2013 to be director of the FAIR AI research division while maintaining a part-time professorial position at New York University. He said in the LinkedIn post that the \"creation of FAIR is my proudest non-technical accomplishment.\"\"I am extremely grateful to Mark Zuckerberg, Andrew Bosworth, Chris Cox, and Mike Schroepfer for their support of FAIR, and for their support of the AMI program over the last few years,\" LeCun said. \"Because of their continued interest and support, Meta will be a partner of the new company.\"At the time, Facebook and Google were heavily recruiting high-level academics like LeCun to spearhead their efforts to produce cutting-edge computer science research that could potentially benefit their core businesses and products.LeCun, along with other AI luminaries like Yoshua Bengio and Geoffrey Hinton, centered their academic research on a kind of AI technique known as deep learning, which involves the training of enormous software systems called neural networks so they can discover patterns within reams of data. The researchers helped popularize the deep learning approach, and in 2019 won the prestigious Turing Award, presented by the Association for Computing Machinery.Since then, LeCun's approach to AI development has drifted from the direction taken by Meta and the rest of Silicon Valley.Meta and other tech companies like OpenAI have spent billions of dollars in developing so-called foundation models, particularly LLMs, as part of their efforts to advance state-of-the-art computing. However, LeCun and other deep-learning experts, have said that these current AI models, while powerful, have a limited understanding of the world, and new computing architectures are needed for researchers to create software that's on par with or surpasses humans on certain tasks, a notion known as artificial general intelligence.\"As I envision it, AMI will have far-ranging applications in many sectors of the economy, some of which overlap with Meta's commercial interests, but many of which do not,\" LeCun said in the post. \"Pursuing the goal of AMI in an independent entity is a way to maximize its broad impact.\"Besides Wang, other recent notables that Zuckerberg brought in to revamp Meta's AI unit include former GitHub CEO Nat Friedman, who heads the unit's product team, and ChatGPT co-creator Shengjia Zhao, the group's chief scientist.In October, Meta laid off 600 employees from its Superintelligence Labs division, including some who were part of the FAIR unit that LeCun helped get off the ground. Those layoffs and other cuts to FAIR over the years, coupled with a new AI leadership team, played a major role in LeCun's decision to leave, according to people familiar with the matter who asked not to be named because they weren't authorized to speak publicly.Additionally, LeCun rarely interacted with Wang nor TBD Labs unit, which is comprised of many of the headline-grabbing hires Zuckerberg made over the summer. TBD Labs oversees the development of Meta's Llama AI models, which were originally developed within FAIR, the people said.While LeCun was always a champion of sharing AI research and related technologies to the open-source community, Wang and his team favor a more closed approach amid intense competition from rivals like OpenAI and Google, the people said.WATCH: Meta is a table pounder here.",

    "body": "Job seekers speak with recruiters during the SacJobs Career job fair in Sacramento, California, US, on Thursday, Nov. 13, 2025.David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesThe Bureau of Labor Statistics on Thursday will release the September nonfarm payrolls number, ending a shutdown-induced blackout on official jobs data, albeit with a decidedly rear-window view.Due at 8:30 a.m. ET, the release is forecast to show a gain of 50,000 jobs in the public and private sectors, up from the initially reported 22,000 in August but still indicative of a soft labor market.Though the report will be backward-looking, it at least will provide some fodder for investors, economists and Federal Reserve officials who have had to rely on a host of private alternative data during the record-long shutdown in Washington, D.C. It will be the first BLS jobs report since the August release on Sept. 5.\"My sense is that the both the September report and the revisions for July and August will suggest a little bit brighter outlook than is commonly assumed, but not much to brag about,\" said Joseph Brusuelas, chief economist at RSM. \"The labor market is holding in there, just like the economy.\"Coming a week after the government impasse ended, the data also is expected to show the unemployment rate at 4.3% while average hourly earnings increased 0.3% for the month and 3.7% from a year ago, all numbers unchanged from August, according to Dow Jones consensus estimates.Because the numbers are from September, they will provide only a little help for policymakers trying to navigate a difficult landscape and could be disregarded by markets. Fed Chair Jerome Powell recently referred to the situation as \"driving in the fog\" and cautioned against looking at further interest rate cuts as guaranteed while officials look for direction.While one month's jobs report will help clear up some of the way, visibility will remain limited.'Pervasive uncertainty'The BLS on Wednesday updated its release dates for the data points it produces.The bureau will not release October's jobs report separately, instead including it with the November report, which has been pushed to Dec. 16 from its original release date of Dec. 5. There will be no unemployment rate released for October due to household data that the BLS will not be able to collect. Similarly, the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey will see a combined September and October release on Dec. 9.The BLS on Oct. 24 released September's consumer price index report only because it is used as a benchmark for Social Security cost of living adjustments.\"The economy is muddling through a period of pervasive uncertainty,\" Brusuelas said. \"Because of the duration of the shutdown, I don't think we're going to get a clean reading until early February on where the labor market's at.\"Nevertheless, other data, such as the private payrolls running tally from ADP along with layoff announcements from job placement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas and a host of other indicators are providing some clues on where the labor market stands.In fact, Fed Governor Christopher Waller in a speech Monday rejected the notion that the Fed doesn't have enough data to make decisions.\"Policymakers and forecasters are not 'flying blind' or 'in a fog,'\" Waller said in a speech advocating a December rate cut. \"While it is always nice to have more data, as economists, we are skilled at using whatever available data there is to formulate forecasts.\"Judging by data revealed so far, Goldman Sachs holds an above-consensus view of 80,000 jobs created in September but sees a decline of 50,000 in October, due largely to the expiration of the federal government's deferred resignation program from cuts associated with Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency.\"While we do not expect the Bureau of Labor Statistics to produce an October unemployment rate, we estimate it likely would have increased, reflecting upward pressure from shutdown-related furloughs and increases in broader measures of labor market slack,\" Goldman economists Ronnie Walker and Jessica Rindels said in a note.In addition to the September headline number, Thursday's report also will include revisions for July and August. Both Brusuelas and the Goldman economists said they expect those numbers to come in higher than the previous counts.",

    "body": "U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell holds a press conference after the Fed cut interest rates by quarter of a percentage point, in Washington, D.C., U.S., Oct. 29, 2025. Kevin Lamarque | ReutersFederal Reserve officials were at odds during their October meeting over cutting interest rates, divided over whether a stalling labor market or stubborn inflation were bigger economic threats, minutes released Wednesday showed.While the Federal Open Market Committee approved a cut at the meeting, the path forward looks less certain. Disagreements stretched into the outlook for December, with officials expressing skepticism about the need for an additional reduction that markets had been widely anticipating, with \"many\" saying that no more cuts are needed at least in 2025.\"Several participants assessed that a further lowering of the target range for the federal funds rate could well be appropriate in December if the economy evolved about as they expected over the coming intermeeting period,\" the minutes said. \"Many participants suggested that, under their economic outlooks, it would likely be appropriate to keep the target range unchanged for the rest of the year.\"In Fed parlance, \"many\" is more than \"several,\" indicating a tilt against a December cut. However, \"participants\" does not denote voters. There are 19 participants at the meeting, but only 12 vote, so it's unclear how the voting members' sentiment is set for a December move.However, the notation jibes with a statement at Fed Chair Jerome Powell's post-meeting news conference. Powell told reporters that a December cut was not a \"foregone conclusion.\"\"In discussing the near-term course of monetary policy, participants expressed strongly differing views about what policy decision would most likely be appropriate at the Committee's December meeting,\" the minutes said.Previous to Powell's statement, traders had been pricing in a near certainty of another move at the Dec. 9-10 session. As of Wednesday afternoon, that had been reduced to about a 1 in 3 chance, according to the CME Group's FedWatch measure of futures pricing. Odds for a January cut are around 66%.The minutes did note that \"most participants\" saw further cuts likely in the future, though not necessarily in December.Ultimately, the FOMC approved a quarter percentage point reduction in the overnight borrowing rate to a range of 3.75%-4%. But the 10-2 vote was not indicative of how split officials were at an institution not generally known for dissent.Officials generally indicated concern over a slowing labor market and inflation that has \"shown little sign of returning sustainably\" to the Fed's 2% target. The minutes reflected multiple camps within the committee.\"Against this backdrop, many participants were in favor of lowering the target range for the federal funds rate at this meeting, some supported such a decision but could have also supported maintaining the level of the target range, and several were against lowering the target range,\" the minutes said.At the heart of the debate was a disagreement over how \"restrictive\" the current policy is for the economy. Some participants thought that even with the quarter-point cut policy was still holding back growth, while others saw that \"the resilience of economic activity\" indicated that policy is not restrictive.Judging from public statements, the panel is divided between inflation doves including Governors Stephen Miran, Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman, who prefer cuts as a way to stave off weakness in the labor market. On the other side are more hawkish members such as regional Presidents Jeffrey Schmid of Kansas City, Susan Collins of Boston and Alberto Musalem of St. Louis, who worry that cutting more could prevent the Fed from getting to its 2% inflation goal.In between are moderates such as Powell, Vice Chair Philip Jefferson and New York President John Williams who favor a patient approach.The minutes noted that \"one participant,\" a reference to Miran, preferred a more aggressive half-point cut. Schmid also voted no, saying he preferred not to cut at all.The meeting minutes indicated the decision-making was complicated by a lack of government data during the 44-day federal government shutdown. Reports on the labor market, inflation and a host of other metrics were not compiled or released during the impasse. Government agencies such as the Bureau of Labor Statistics and Bureau of Economic Analysis have announced schedules for some of the releases but not all.Powell compared the situation to \"driving in the fog,\" though Waller on Monday rejected that comparison, saying the Fed has plenty of data to formulate policy.The minutes also discussed the balance sheet aspect of policy. The FOMC agreed to stop the reduction of Treasury and mortgage-backed securities in December, a process that has shaved more than $2.5 trillion off the balance sheet, which is still around $6.6 trillion. There appeared to be widespread approval for the halting of a process known as quantitative tightening.",

South Florida Sun-sentinel | Tribune News Service | Getty ImagesA federal grand jury charged U.S. Rep. Sheila Cherfilus-McCormick, D-Fla., with stealing $5 million in Covid-19 disaster funds — a chunk of which was then illegally contributed to her 2021 congressional campaign, the Department of Justice said Wednesday. Cherfilus-McCormick and her brother, Edwin Cherfilus, tried to launder the money through multiple accounts to disguise its source, the DOJ said, citing the indictment issued in U.S. District Court in Miami.The siblings obtained the money in July 2021, after the family health-care company where they worked received a $5 million overpayment from FEMA, which funded the company's Covid vaccination staffing contract, according to the DOJ.Cherfilus-McCormick and another defendant, Nadege Leblanc, are also accused of orchestrating a \"straw donor\" scheme in which money from the FEMA contract was sent to friends and relatives, who then donated it back to her campaign for Congress.Cherfilus-McCormick joined the House in 2022 after winning a special election that January to fill late Rep. Alcee Hastings' seat representing Florida's 20th Congressional District.The congresswoman and her 2021 tax preparer, David Spencer, are also charged in the indictment with conspiring to file a false tax return, the DOJ said. They claimed personal and political expenses as business deductions and \"inflated charitable contributions in order to reduce her tax obligations,\" the indictment alleges.Cherfilus-McCormick faces a possible maximum sentence of 53 years in prison if convicted, the DOJ said in a press release. Actual sentences are often significantly lower than the maximums due to judges' discretion and federal sentencing guidelines.Read more CNBC politics coverageTrump calls to revoke ABC's license over reporter's Epstein files questionAI could be causing ‘quiet time’ in labor market, top Trump economic aide Hassett saysTrump reverses stance on Epstein records, presses Republicans to support releaseFormer Fed Gov.

Instead, the agency said October payroll data will be released along with a full report for November. An unemployment rate for October will not be included in those figures because the data \"could not be collected,\" the BLS said, citing the shutdown. The agency also pushed back its November jobs data release to Dec. 16 from Dec. 5. The new date is six days after the Federal Reserve concludes its final policy meeting of the year — leaving the central bank with less information on the state of the economy. The delayed September nonfarm payrolls report is scheduled to be released on Thursday.Without the full October data — and following recent hawkish commentary from some Fed officials — traders may be pricing in a lower chance of another rate reduction. The CME Group's FedWatch tool at midday Wednesday showed there's a 63.8% chance that the Fed keeps its overnight benchmark rate steady in the 3.75%-4% range. That's up from around 50% earlier in the day. ",

The Defense Department will finance the U.S. portion of the venture with MP providing technical and marketing expertise. The binding agreement to form the joint venture comes after MP and Maaden signed a memoranum of understanding back in May. The agreement will \"significantly expand MP's global footprint\" and is structured to \"ensure U.S. oversight and alignment with national security objectives,\" the company said.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconMP Materials stock over the past six monthsMP is also holding talks on a possible collaboration to standup magnet manufacuring in Saudi Arabia. The Pentagon struck a landmark deal with MP in July that includes an equity stake, a price floor, and offtake agreement. The Trump administration is investing in MP as it seeks to reduce U.S. dependence on China for rare earth imports and stand up a domestic supply chain. MP CEO James Litinsky has described the company as the U.S. \"national champion\" for rare earths. Rare earths are crucial inputs in U.S. weapons platforms, electric vehicles, clean energy technology, semiconductor manufacturing and consumer electronics. Goldman Sachs initiated converage of MP on Tuesday with a price target of $77, implying about 32% upside from Monday's closing price. \"We believe MP's downstream expansion into refining and magnet production, accelerated by a partnership with the US government, will strategically position MP as a key supply chain component for rare earth refining and magnet production,\" Goldman analyst Brian Lee told clients.

    "body": "US Senate Majority Leader John Thune, Republican from South Dakota, speaks with reporters outside his office on day 41 of the federal government shutdown, at the US Capitol in Washington, DC, November 10, 2025. Saul Loeb | Afp | Getty ImagesPresident Donald Trump on Wednesday night said he signed a bill ordering the Department of Justice to release its files on sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.The announcement in a lengthy Truth Social post followed the bill's near-unanimous passage in Congress.\"I HAVE JUST SIGNED THE BILL TO RELEASE THE EPSTEIN FILES!\" Trump wrote in the 390-word post, which painted the notorious financier as a \"lifelong Democrat\" who \"was deeply associated with many well-known Democrat figures.\"Trump, a former friend of Epstein's, also stressed that he had asked Republican leaders in the House and Senate to pass the bill — even though his administration had reportedly opposed the push to release the files. After the vote on the bill was scheduled in the House, Trump on Sunday night abruptly urged Republicans to back it.\"Because of this request, the votes were almost unanimous in favor of passage,\" Trump wrote Wednesday night.The bill instructs Attorney General Pam Bondi to publicly release unclassified records relating to Epstein and his convicted accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell, among other information, within 30 days of its signing. But the legislation contains exceptions, including for information containing victims' personally identifiable information or child sex abuse materials.It also includes a carve-out for records that \"would jeopardize an active federal investigation or ongoing prosecution.\" Bondi, acquiescing to a request from Trump, said last week that she had assigned Manhattan U.S. Attorney Jay Clayton to investigate Epstein's ties to several of the president's perceived foes.The legislation received overwhelming support in the House, with all but one lawmaker, Republican Rep. Clay Higgins of Louisiana, voting for it on Tuesday.It passed immediately when it was sent to the Senate on Wednesday morning. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., had secured a unanimous consent agreement, which allowed the legislation to sail through the upper chamber as soon as it was received.Read more about the Epstein filesHouse overwhelmingly passes bill to release Jeffrey Epstein filesTrump calls to revoke ABC's license over reporter's Epstein files questionJeffrey Epstein files: Larry Summers steps back from public commitments over email falloutJeffrey Epstein victims' ad calls for files to be released, Trump urges GOP to vote for House measureTrump reverses stance on Epstein records, presses Republicans to support releaseJeffrey Epstein on Trump: 'I know how dirty donald is'Trump to ask DOJ to probe Jeffrey Epstein involvement with Clinton, JPMorgan, SummersGoldman Sachs stands by top lawyer Kathy Ruemmler after her emails with Jeffrey Epstein exposedJeffrey Epstein files: House speaker announces vote next week on release of docsDespite his sudden shift in stance on the bill, Trump has continued to fume about the focus on Epstein, calling it a \"hoax\" being pushed by Democrats to distract from his administration's achievements. He has repeatedly lashed out at reporters when asked about his connections to Epstein, who died by suicide in jail in 2019 while facing federal sex trafficking charges. Trump and Epstein were friends until the early 2000s, but the two had a falling out years before Epstein's death.When an ABC News reporter asked Trump on Tuesday why he has not released the Epstein files on his own — as he has the power to do — the president insulted her and called for ABC's broadcast license to be revoked.The White House did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment.Trump on the 2024 campaign trail suggested he would release files related to Epstein. In the early months of his second term, officials in his administration signaled they were pushing to disclose those files. Attorney General Pam Bondi said in February, for instance, that Epstein's rumored \"client list\" was \"sitting on my desk right now to review.\" The same month, a group of pro-Trump influencers received binders labeled \"The Epstein Files: Phase 1\" at the White House.But those binders contained little new information. And the DOJ, in an unsigned memo in July, said that a review of its Epstein-related materials \"revealed no incriminating 'client list.'\" The memo also included the agency's conclusion that \"no further disclosure would be appropriate or warranted.\"The announcement enraged both Democrats and some prominent voices in Trump's base. In subsequent months, scrutiny increased over Trump's past association with Epstein.In July, The Wall Street Journal reported the existence of a \"bawdy\" and cryptic note to Epstein bearing Trump's signature, which was part of a collection of letters gathered for Epstein's 50th birthday in 2003. Trump has denied writing the letter and filed a defamation lawsuit against the Journal's publisher and media mogul Rupert Murdoch.The House Oversight Committee last week released thousands of documents it had obtained from Epstein's estate through a subpoena, including emails showing Epstein discussing Trump.In one email thread in 2018, Epstein wrote of Trump, \"I know how dirty donald is.\" In an April 2019 email to author Michael Wolff, Epstein wrote that Trump \"knew about the girls.\" CNBC has not independently verified the emails, and it is unclear what Epstein was referring to.House Democrats and a handful of Republicans sought to approve a discharge petition that would force a vote in the GOP-majority chamber on the bill to release the Epstein files. That effort was delayed for weeks by the government shutdown, which postponed the swearing-in of a Democratic lawmaker who would provide the last needed signature.Read more CNBC politics coverageTrump calls to revoke ABC's license over reporter's Epstein files questionAI could be causing ‘quiet time’ in labor market, top Trump economic aide Hassett saysTrump reverses stance on Epstein records, presses Republicans to support releaseFormer Fed Gov.

    "body": "A home is shown for sale in The Heights in Houston, Monday, Oct. 27, 2025. Kirk Sides | Houston Chronicle | Getty ImagesThis is the strongest buyer's market in housing in more than a decade. That's the headline on a new report from Redfin, a real estate brokerage owned by Rocket Cos. The report points to specific data on the supply of homes for sale and the number of buyers actively looking. There were an estimated 36.8% more sellers than buyers in October, according to Redfin, the largest gap in records dating back to 2013. Redfin defines a buyer's market as one with at least 10% more sellers than buyers. Economists at the brokerage estimate that the last time there was a stronger buyer's market was in the years following the 2008 financial crisis, when home prices plummeted across the nation. \"Of course, it's only a buyer's market for those who can afford to buy—many Americans have been priced out of the housing market as affordability has eroded,\" Redfin researchers noted. And that's the crux of the problem. Is it really a buyer's market, if so many buyers are still priced out and therefore not even looking?Real estate firms cite housing affordability as the biggest challenge to their business, according to a new report from the National Association of Realtors. It far outweighs other challenges, including industry costs.\"Real estate firms are on the frontlines of the industry and are seeing firsthand how housing affordability and local economic conditions are impacting their clients,\" said Jessica Lautz, NAR deputy chief economist.Home prices continue to weaken but, nationally at least, were still 1.2% higher in September from the year before, according to Cotality. Prices are roughly 50% higher nationally than they were just five years ago, pre-pandemic.\"Much like the K-shaped trend seen in overall consumer spending—driven largely by higher income groups—lower-income potential homebuyers are facing challenges due to an uncertain job market, sluggish wage growth, and worsening financial conditions. This is leading to weaker demand for homes and downward pressure on prices,\" said Selma Hepp, Cotality's chief economist. Get Property Play directly to your inboxCNBC's Property Play with Diana Olick covers new and evolving opportunities for the real estate investor, delivered weekly to your inbox.Subscribe here to get access today.Mortgage rates have come off their recent highs, but are still roughly twice what they were in the first years of the pandemic, when it fast became a seller's market.Cost remains the primary obstacle to homebuying, with about 75 of the top 100 housing markets still considered overvalued, according to Cotality. In Washington, D.C., which was hardest hit by the recent government shutdown, potential buyers — largely those who were unaffected by the shutdown — are discovering it is easier to get good deals. \"They are figuring out they have leverage and are finding they can seek price concessions and repairs,\" said Paul Legere, a buyer's agent with the Joel Nelson Group of Keller Williams, adding it \"feels like it might be a short moment in time.\"The shutdown may be over, but consumer sentiment is not pointing to a surge in homebuying. In its November sentiment survey, that National Association of Home Builders reported a drop in builder sales expectations over the next six months. \"We continue to see demand-side weakness as a softening labor market and stretched consumer finances are contributing to a difficult sales environment,\" said NAHB Chief Economist Robert Dietz. ",

    "body": "Tesla CEO Elon Musk (L) talks with Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang during the U.S.-Saudi Investment Forum at the Kennedy Center on Nov. 19, 2025 in Washington, DC.Win McNamee | Getty ImagesNvidia and xAI said on Wednesday that a large data center facility being built in Saudi Arabia and equipped with hundreds of thousands of Nvidia chips will count Elon Musk's artificial intelligence startup as its first customer.Musk and Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang were both in attendance at the U.S.-Saudi Investment Forum in Washington, D.C.The announcement builds on a partnership from May, when Nvidia said it would provide Saudi Arabia's Humain with chips that use 500 megawatts of power. On Wednesday, Humain said the project would include about 600,000 Nvidia graphics processing units. Humain was launched earlier this year and is owned by the Saudi Public Investment Fund. The plan to build the data center was initially announced when Huang visited Saudi Arabia alongside President Donald Trump. \"Could you imagine, a startup company approximately 0 billion dollars in revenues, now going to build a data center for Elon,\" Huang said. The facility is one of the most prominent examples of what Nvidia calls \"sovereign AI.\" The chipmaker has said that nations will increasingly need to build data centers for AI in order to protect national security and their culture. It's also a potentially massive market for Nvidia's pricey AI chips beyond a handful of hyperscalers.Huang's appearance at an event supported by President Trump is another sign of the administration's focus on AI. Huang has become friendly with the president as Nvidia lobbies to gain licenses to ship future AI chips to China. When announcing the agreement, Musk, who was a major figure in the early days of the second Trump administration, briefly mixed up the size of the data center, which is measured in megawatts, a unit of power. He joked that plans for a data center that would be 1,000 times larger would have to wait. \"That will be eight bazillion, trillion dollars,\" Musk joked.Humain won't just use Nvidia chips. Advanced Micro Devices and Qualcomm will also sell chips and AI systems to Humain. AMD CEO Lisa Su and Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon both attended a state dinner on Tuesday to honor Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. AMD will provide chips that may require as much as 1 gigawatt of power by 2030. The company said the chips that it would provide are its Instinct MI450 GPUs for AI. Cisco will provide additional infrastructure for the data center, AMD said.Qualcomm will sell Humain its new data center chips that were first revealed in October, called the AI200 and AI250. Humain will deploy 200 megawatts of Qualcomm chips, the company said.WATCH: Qualcomm CEO on new AI chipswatch now",

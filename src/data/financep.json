Goldman also reported that the labor market is loosening, meaning there are more workers than jobs, to levels not seen in 10 years.</p><p>A New York Fed survey released Monday indicated ongoing concern with the state of the labor market.</p><p>The central bank's monthly Survey of Consumer Expectations for September showed that the share of those expecting the unemployment rate to be higher a year from now rose to 41.1%, up 2 percentage points from the prior month. Also, the mean probability of losing one's job in the next year increased to 14.9%, up 0.4 percentage point.</p><p>However, the perceived probability of being able to find a job in three months after losing one's current position rose to 47.4%, up from a series low 44.9% in August.</p></div></div>",

Gold is on pace for its third straight year of double-digit gains, even hitting <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/01/gold-hits-record-high-as-us-government-shutdown-dents-risk-appetite-.html\">record highs</a> this week during the government shutdown.</p><p>On Tuesday, gold prices hit <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/07/gold-4000-record.html\">$4,000 an ounce</a> for the first time in history — and they're showing no signs of slowing down.</p><p>Analysts from UBS wrote last week that lower interest rates, weakness in the dollar and political uncertainty will only continue to drive the price of gold higher.</p><p>\"We now expect inflows for this year to be 830 metric tons, which is almost double our initial forecast of 450 metric tons at the start of the year,\" the UBS analysts wrote in a note. \"The key risk for gold is better U.S. growth and if the Fed is forced to raise rates due to inflation-related upside surprises.\"</p><p>A Goldman Sachs <a href=\"https://www.goldmansachs.com/insights/articles/gold-forecast-to-rise-by-the-middle-of-2026\" target=\"_blank\">report</a> from late last month predicted the climb, forecasting that the price of gold will rise 6% through the middle of 2026 to $4,000 per troy ounce, a unit of measurement used for precious metals. The report categorized buyers of gold into two groups: conviction buyers, who purchase the metal consistently, and opportunistic buyers, who jump in \"when they believe the price is right.\"</p><p>The analysts said they expect central banks to continue buying gold for three more years.</p><p>\"Our rationale is that emerging market central banks remain significantly underweight gold compared to their developed market counterparts and are gradually increasing allocations as part of a broader diversification strategy,\" analyst Lina Thomas wrote.</p><p>And according to July <a href=\"https://www.gold.org/news-and-events/press-releases/strong-investor-interest-drives-gold-demand-higher\" target=\"_blank\">survey data</a> from the World Gold Council, roughly 95% of central banks expect global gold holdings to rise in the next year.</p></div><div><div><svg width=\"256\" height=\"256\">Stock Chart IconStock chart icon</svg><p><img src=\"https://static-redesign.cnbcfm.com/dist/a54b41835a8b60db28c2.svg\" alt=\"hide content\" /></p></div><p>Gold futures</p></div><div><p>That uncertainty comes on top of an already turbulent global economy reeling from changing tariff policies from President <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/donald-trump/\">Donald Trump</a>. Though he <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/11/trump-gold-tariffs-futures.html\">made clear</a> in August that gold will not be tariffed and that bars from Switzerland will not be subject to the country's 39% tariff, Trump's steep rates on other countries have been disrupting the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/19/trade-war-tariffs-consumer-prices-inflation-retail.html\">global supply chain</a>.</p><p>For jewelers, the rising price of the precious metal may be a cause for concern. Large retailers like <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/\">Pandora</a> and <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/SIG/\">Signet</a><span><span></span></span></span> have signaled that they are exploring price hikes or alternative manufacturing methods to counteract the hit they're taking from gold.</p><p>And some jewelry companies that aim to offer gold products at lower price points, like Mejuri, are feeling the pressure too.</p><p>Mejuri, which aims to sell<strong> </strong>gold and luxury jewelry at more affordable levels than its competitors, announced last month that the company was being forced to raise its prices due to the rising cost of gold, silver and tariffs.</p><p>\"While we've been doing everything we can to absorb the impact and preserve the quality and craftsmanship you expect from us, you'll see some prices update on Monday, September 29th,\" Mejuri wrote in an email to customers. \"We're tackling these shifts head-on: streamlining our supply chain, strengthening sourcing and designing with pricing in mind.\"</p><p>The company said it's also innovating new products like 10 karat solid gold to keep offering quality jewelry at affordable prices. Mejuri declined to comment.</p></div><h2><a></a>'A fear indicator'</h2><div><p>With the price of gold rising and showing no signs of stopping, some jewelry companies are being forced to be innovative with their pricing and products.</p><p>In its second-quarter earnings report in August, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/15/us-shoppers-fuel-jewelry-splurge-despite-tariff-headwinds.html\">Pandora</a> said it faced an 80-basis point hit due to higher prices of gold and silver and that it planned some price adjustments to offset those headwinds. And on <a href=\"https://www.signetjewelers.com/investors/financial-news-releases/financial-news-release/2024/Signet-Jewelers-Reports-Second-Quarter-Fiscal-2025-Results/default.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">Signet's</a> most recent earnings call in early September, the company said it had seen more than 30% increase in the cost of gold.</p><p>BaubleBar, which specializes in fine jewelry, offers a large selection of \"demi-fine\" gold pieces, which co-founder Daniella Yacobovsky said has allowed the company to somewhat avoid the brunt of the pressure from gold prices.</p><p>The company's demi-fine jewelry features a thick, high-quality 18k gold plated over a sterling silver base, which allows BaubleBar to avoid the costs associated with solid gold jewelry. The brand's demi-fine earrings range from anywhere between $50 to $150.</p><p>\"We've actually seen a really huge increase in interest in demi-fine,\" Yacobovsky told CNBC. \"I think that it offers people a really fantastic alternative to solid gold. … You're going to get a really fantastic quality similar to that for a lower price point.\"</p><p>Still, Yacobovsky said it's concerning that significant events affecting the global economy are happening at higher rates than even five years ago. She said she hasn't seem something as volatile as the skyrocketing price of gold in the industry \"for a long time.\"</p><p>The key, she said, will be for businesses to capitalize on their ability to make smart choices.</p><p>For Alexis Bittar, CEO of his eponymous jewelry company, the smart choice meant leaning into gold-plated pieces, which allows the company to save costs over solid gold, and raising prices slightly to match the products that are coming in.</p><p>But the company is not repricing any of its existing products, Bittar said.</p><p>\"You're constantly juggling between the tariff and the acceleration of the gold prices, so you're staying within a price point that you're known for,\" Bittar said. \"From the consumer side, they're not really caring. They vaguely know the prices of gold are going up … but mentally, they have an unconscious price point that they're looking to spend, and when you start to way exceed it, you're pricing people out.\"</p><p>Bittar said his company is seeing a \"cautious\" consumer, but that any pullback in spending is likely more related to solid gold than plated gold, and that the wealthy consumer base is more willing to pay higher prices than lower- or middle-income shoppers.</p><p>Even for ear piercing company Rowan, which also offers gold jewelry, the rapidly changing industry may be spelling trouble. CEO Louisa Schneider told CNBC that it's hard to imagine any other industry whose raw material costs have risen as dramatically as gold.</p></div><div><p>Rowan Piercing Studio's Suburban Square location in Ardmore, PA.</p><p>Courtesy: Rowan</p></div><div><p>Because ear piercing requires some level of surgical steel or titanium for ideal healing, Rowan often uses 14k gold to coat those materials, leaving the company \"somewhat insulated\" from the rising price of gold because it is required to uphold certain health and safety standards.</p><p>Still, Schneider said Rowan had to raise prices on some of its gold pieces in the beginning of the third quarter, which she said customers are willing to pay for because the company specializes in employing trained nurses for the piercings.</p><p>\"This is a fear indicator. So that, from my standpoint, is quite concerning,\" Schneider said. \"Our expectation is that we do not see a significant reduction in the current pricing – if anything, we expect that gold will continue to be quite expensive. So we will continue to hedge ourselves and to work really closely with our vendors.\"</p><p>Schneider said she's seeing an \"inflection point\" in the price of gold and that it's a cause for concern for all jewelry companies, but especially those that are unable to raise their prices to counteract the costs because they sell to non-luxury consumers who are less flexible with price changes.</p><p>Ultimately, she said this serves as a warning sign for the broader economy, even if it might not be hitting Rowan too hard.</p><p>\"The demand is not coming from consumers that want to wear gold or industries that require gold as a component of manufacturing,\" Schneider said. \"This is coming from a hoarding of gold given an uncertainty around the U.S. dollar, and that's unlike anything that we've seen.\"</p><p><em>Correction: A previous version of this story misstated Signet's sales.</em></p></div></div>",

Many investors were hoping for updates on other new products such as the next-generation Roadster that Musk has promised for years.</p><p>The standard variant of the Model Y doesn't feature a panoramic glass roof, leather seats or the light bars like the higher-end versions of the SUV. It costs about $5,000 less than the previous, entry-level version of the Model Y.</p><p>The new Model Y standard features a battery that gets 321 miles of estimated range on a full charge, compared to the 357 miles of range in a Long Range version with rear wheel drive.</p><p>The lower prices may help Tesla attract some buyers after the loss of $7,500 federal EV tax credits, which went away with <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/donald-trump/\">President Donald Trump's</a> spending bill.

The Cybertuck never achieved the level of popularity of Tesla's Model 3 sedan or Model Y SUVs and has been the subject of at least eight voluntary recalls in the U.S.</p><p>With its auto sales in a multi-quarter slump, Tesla has been trying to shift investor attention to its future as a robotics and self-driving car busine<em>s</em>s.</p><p>The slump has resulted, in part, from a consumer backlash against Musk, his endorsements of far-right political parties and figures, and his incendiary political rhetoric. But it's also due to an aging lineup and increased competition from companies including Volkswagen and BYD.</p><p>In mid-October of last year, Tesla held its invitation-only, \"We, Robot\" event in Hollywood, where it showed off a low, two-seater Cybercab concept with no steering wheels or pedals. Musk said the driverless car would cost about $30,000.</p><p>As of the company's second-quarter earnings call, it was not yet in production.</p><p>At an <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2017/11/17/tesla-semi-and-roadster-impressed-but-questions-linger.html\">event in late 2017</a>, Musk promised Tesla would make a next-generation Roadster, but the vehicle has never moved into production. In 2021, Musk promised the Roadster would be able to \"fly,\" and last year he said the elusive sports car was being redesigned in collaboration with SpaceX, his aerospace and defense contractor.</p><p>Musk has been promising to turn existing Tesla EVs into robotaxis with a software update for about a decade.</p><p>The company currently has human safety drivers in its Robotaxi-branded test and fleet vehicles, unlike robotaxi rivals like <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/GOOGL/\">Alphabet's</a><span><span></span></span></span> Waymo and <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/BIDU/\">Baidu's</a><span><span></span></span></span> Apollo Go.</p><p>In the realm of humanoid robots, Musk has said Tesla's Optimus robots will be capable of factory work or babysitting your kids, but they've yet to hit the market. Meanwhile, competitors like Agility Robotics and Unitree are already selling bipedal, humanoid robots.</p><p>Following a brutal first quarter that saw Tesla lose 36% of its value, the stock has been on a tear, jumping 40% in the third quarter. It's now up 12% for the year. That stock price increase was aided by Musk, who purchased about $1 billion of Tesla stock himself in mid-September.</p><p><strong>WATCH:</strong> <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/video/2025/10/06/tesla-teases-new-product-launch-in-social-media-post.html\">Tesla teases new product launch</a></p></div><div><p><img src=\"https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/108208275-17597686351759768633-41974447527-1080pnbcnews.jpg?v=1759768634&w=750&h=422&vtcrop=y\" alt=\"Tesla teases new product launch in social media post\" /><span></span><span><div><p><span>watch now</span><span></span></p></div></span></p></div></div>",

    "body": "The logo of Japanese company SoftBank Group is seen outside the company's headquarters in Tokyo on January 22, 2025. Kazuhiro Nogi | Afp | Getty ImagesSoftBank's continued push into AI with investments in ChatGPT maker OpenAI and PayPay helped the Japanese giant post a $19 billion gain on its Vision Fund in its fiscal second quarter.The broader Vision Fund segment factors in non-investment performance such as administrative expenses and gains and losses attributable to third-party investors. The value of the fund had risen $4.8 billion in the company's fiscal first quarter.Softbank is ploughing ahead with its push into artificial intelligence, investing and acquiring firms that will bolster its presence in robots and Artificial Super Intelligence (ASI).AI revenues reached \"new highs\" in the quarter ended Sept. 30 with 93% of annualized growth, Softbank said in a investor briefing on the results. Gains from the company's investment in OpenAI totaled 2.157 trillion yen ($14 billion) in the quarter.The company also said Tuesday that it will conduct a four-for-one stock split at the end of the year in a bid to make its shares more accessible to investors and to further expand its shareholder base.Here's how SoftBank fared in the fiscal second quarter:Profit hit 2.502 trillion yen in the quarter, versus 206.89 billion yen expected, according to LSEG consensus estimates. It also compares to 1.18 trillion yen net profit a year earlier.Revenue hit 1.92 trillion in the quarter, compared to an LSEG estimate of 1.9 trillion yen.AI jittersThe Japanese conglomerate's stock has slumped in the past week as concerns of an AI bubble sent jitters through global markets. Nearly $50 billion in market cap was wiped out from the stock last week, marking its worst weekly loss since March 2020. However, shares are up over 140% this year as its tech investment arm has showed signs of recovery.Last month Softbank reportedly approved its final tranche of funding to complete its $30 billion investment in OpenAI. The Japanese firm's investment in the ChatGPT maker came with a caveat — that its total investment could be slashed to as low as $20 billion if OpenAI didn't restructure into a for-profit entity by Dec. 31.The AI startup recently completed its recapitalization, cementing its structure as a nonprofit with a controlling stake in its for-profit business, which is now a public benefit corporation called OpenAI Group PBC.Softbank said in its earning statement Tuesday that it will invest an additional $22.5 billion in OpenAI through its Vision Fund 2 in December.— CNBC's Arjun Kharpal contributed to this report.",

    "body": "Paramount Global and Skydance logos are seen in this illustration taken December 17, 2024. Dado Ruvic | ReutersParamount Skydance said on Monday it expects $1 billion more in merger savings than it previously forecast as it outlines CEO David Ellison's ambitions for the company.The update came in Paramount's third-quarter earnings report — the company's first since its merger closed in early August. Ellison has been investing heavily in streaming and content, including live sports rights, and paying for it in part with cuts to other parts of the business.Paramount on Monday announced a new round of layoffs, affecting roughly 1,600 employees, tied to divestitures of assets in Argentina and Chile. Those cuts come weeks after Paramount began the process to lay off approximately 1,000 employees.At the same time, Paramount said it plans to increase prices for its flagship streaming service, Paramount+, in the first quarter of next year as it looks to beef up its content slate and improve its the technology of the platform.Paramount last raised its streaming prices in June 2024, after a previous hike in early 2023.Shares of the company were up about 6% in extended trading Monday.Cutting to growIn Monday's letter to shareholders, Ellison mapped out the combined company's initiatives, which he referred to as Paramount Skydance's \"North Star priorities.\" Those include investing in its growth businesses, growing its streaming business globally and identifying savings that would lead to \"long-term free cash flow generation.\"While Paramount Skydance management told investors in August they planned $2 billion in cost savings, that was upped to \"at least $3 billion in run-rate efficiencies\" as of Monday's report. More than $1.4 billion of those savings will be done by the end of the year and an additional $1 billion by the end of 2026, according to the letter.The company has been shedding staff. Less than a month after the merger was completed, the company alerted employees that it would be mandating a five-day work week beginning in January and would offer employees a buyout if they didn't want to make the transition. According to Monday's letter, about 600 employees chose to exit the company rather than return to an office full-time.The company also identified parts of its South American business to cut and said Monday it divested Television Federal, the operator of TV stations in Buenos Aires and other markets in Argentina. It's also in the process of exiting Chilevision in Chile, which is expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2026.These divestitures, which were deemed \"non-core\" to the company's future growth, according to the letter, would result in the 1,600 workforce reductions.Streaming, content in focusParamount Skydance CEO David Ellison speaks during the Bloomberg Screentime conference in Los Angeles on October 9, 2025. Patrick T. Fallon | Afp | Getty ImagesWhile Paramount Skydance's restructuring efforts, layoffs and cost savings have been a top priority for the company, Ellison has also wasted no time in making acquisitions to build up its content slate.Most notably, the company has reportedly been looking to acquire Warner Bros. Discovery in a deal that would see it gain the Warner Bros. film studio, the HBO Max streaming service, and a portfolio of cable TV networks including CNN and TNT Sports. Warner Bros. Discovery recently put itself up for sale, and has rebuffed three offers from Ellison in recent weeks, CNBC reported.Ellison wouldn't comment on his aspirations for WBD on Monday, but said the company was in build mode, which may or may not include mergers and acquisitions.\"I think it's important to know there's no must-haves for us,\" he said. \"We really look at this as buy versus build, and we absolutely have the ability to build to get to where we want to go.\" On the sports front, Paramount Skydance has added TKO Group's UFC to its slate in a 7-year, $7.7 billion deal. Paramount+ also became the exclusive long-term home for Zuffa Boxing, a new professional boxing promotion formed by TKO and the Saudi-backed Sela, in the U.S., Canada and Latin America.The company also inked a deal with Activision to develop content off of its Call of Duty video game franchise; signed a 5-year exclusive agreement with the creators of \"South Park;\" and brought on Matt and Ross Duffer, the creative team behind Netflix's hit \"Stranger Things,\" beginning in mid-2026.The additions to its content slate are geared at boosting Paramount+ streaming subscribers. Paramount Skydance President Jeff Shell said during a call with investors that the service had experienced notable customer losses over the summer, but they returned in the fall at the start of the NFL season.On Monday, the company said Paramount+ had more than 79 million global subscribers.

    "body": "The Sony Group Corp. logo displayed on a screen at the Combined Exhibition of Advanced Technologies (Ceatec) in Chiba, Japan, on Wednesday, Oct. 16, 2024. Bloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesSony Group on Tuesday posted a stronger-than-expected rise in second-quarter operating profit and announced a share buyback of up to 100 billion Japanese yen ($648 million).Here are Sony's second-quarter results compared with LSEG SmartEstimates, which are weighted toward forecasts from analysts who are more consistently accurate: Revenue: 3.108 trillion Japanese yen ($20.14 billion) vs. 2.985 trillion yen expectedOperating profit: 429 billion yen vs. 398.44 billion yen expectedOperating profit climbed 10% from a year earlier, while revenues were up 5%. Sony shares jumped more than 6% after the earnings release.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconThe Japanese technology giant raised its full-year outlook, expecting operating profit to climb by 100 billion yen, or 8% from its previous forecast, led by its imaging and sensing solutions and music segments. The company also lifted its annual revenue projection by 300 billion yen, or 3%, while trimming its estimated losses from U.S. tariffs to 50 billion yen from 70 billion yen.While Sony has been affected by U.S. President Donald Trump's global tariff regime launched in April, Tokyo reached a trade deal with Washington in July that lowered duties on Japanese exports to 15% from the 25% initially proposed. The reduced tariffs took effect Aug. 7.Music and imaging boostProfit from Sony's music business increased 27.65% year over year to 115.4 billion yen, while operating profit from its imaging business jumped nearly 50% to 138.3 billion yen, making it the company's most profitable segment in the quarter.Sony's imaging and sensing solutions segment develops and manufactures advanced semiconductor products for a wide range of applications, from smartphones to automotive and industrial systems.The company also reported strong sales in its game and network services division, which houses its popular PlayStation home console brand. The segment represents Sony's top revenue driver, but posted a decrease in profits in the September quarter, falling 13.26% to 120.4 billion yen.Game and network services have performed well in recent quarters thanks to a shift to digital game purchases and the PlayStation Plus subscription service. Growth in hardware shipments has been comparably muted.KPop Demon HuntersDespite Sony's strong earnings showing, profit from its picture business shrank nearly 25% year over year. That was despite Sony Pictures Animation being behind this year's smash hit production, KPop Demon Hunters, which premiered on June 20. The film, which was produced by Sony, has reportedly become the most popular Netflix film ever, and continues to break streaming records, even for its original soundtrack. Despite the success, Sony has missed much of this upside due to selling the film's exclusive rights to Netflix.While the exact details of the deal are unknown, it was reported that Sony made an initial $25 million profit from producing the film for Netflix.Netflix saw K-pop Demon Hunters drive significant viewership and even contributed to its 17% revenue jump in its September quarter.However, in a bright spot for Sony, a sequel to the movie has already been confirmed, with Netflix reportedly providing the Japanese company a $15 million cash bonus for the first film's performance. ",

Bloomberg reported that a deal could be finalized within weeks.\"We are not commenting on the ongoing discussions,\" a spokesperson at Switzerland's economy ministry told CNBC, adding that Swiss Economy Minister Guy Parmelin \"is in regular contact with the relevant authorities in the U.S., including USTR Jamieson Greer.\"CNBC has contacted the White House for further comment and is awaiting a response.

The Swiss government said that the trade relationship between the two was \"relatively balanced,\" according to a CNBC translation.\"The U.S. has a surplus of services exports and Switzerland does for goods exports,\" the government said in August, adding that its goods surplus is not rooted in unfair trade practices and that over 99% of U.S. goods can be imported to Switzerland without being subject to tariffs.",

    "body": "Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla, speaks during the 2025 Annual Shareholder Meeting on Nov. 6, 2025.Courtesy: TeslaTesla shareholders voted last week to give CEO Elon Musk a record pay package, one that could net him about $1 trillion in company stock over the next decade. But Musk received less support than he did for an earlier pay plan in 2018.Setting aside holdings owned by board members and executives, about 66.9% of shares tabulated in the vote were in favor of the package, according to a filing on Friday. When shareholders voted on the 2018 plan, that number was 73%, according to an analysis by Andrew Droste, head of corporate governance at investment firm Columbia Threadneedle.In announcing the preliminary results on Thursday at the company's annual shareholders meeting, Tesla said the plan received 75% support among voting shares. The company count included insiders like Musk, who held around a 15% stake in Tesla going into the proxy and was allowed to vote his shares.The decline from the prior vote follows a tumultuous stretch for Musk and Tesla. Sales slumped in the first half of the year, in part because of Musk's inflammatory political rhetoric and his work for the Trump administration, slashing the size of the federal government. Tesla's brand value has also deteriorated.Still, Droste said in an email that even at just under 70%, the vote represents \"broad support for Elon among Tesla's shareholder base.\" Most investors recognize that Tesla and Elon Musk are \"inextricably linked,\" he wrote, and were \"unwilling to risk his potential departure by allowing this vote to fail.\"Board members recommended shareholders approve the pay plan, which they introduced in September. Top proxy advisors Glass Lewis and ISS had recommended that investors vote against it.The pay package for Musk, already the world's richest person, consists of 12 tranches of shares to be granted if Tesla hits certain milestones over the next decade. The first tranche of stock gets paid out if Tesla hits a market capitalization of $2 trillion, about $500 billion more than the current valuation. Awards tied to market cap gains are paired with operational achievements.Musk could still collect more than $50 billion by hitting a handful of the more attainable goals laid out for him by the board in the new pay plan. There are also a list of \"covered events\" in the award terms that would allow him to earn his shares without meeting required operational milestones.Tesla didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.Correction: A prior version of this story had an incorrect figure for the vote in support of the pay package.WATCH: Key milestones behind Musk's pay packagewatch now",

    "body": "Police officers stand guard outside the Supreme Court on November 5, 2025 in Washington, DC. Andrew Harnik | Getty ImagesThe Trump administration told the Supreme Court on Monday morning that it still wants a block on a Rhode Island federal judge's order mandating that it pay 42 million Americans their full SNAP benefits for November.The message came a day after the 1st Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals in Boston, for a second time, flatly rejected a request by the Trump administration to stay that order pending its full appeal of the decision.That judge's order remains temporarily paused as a result of a prior ruling by Supreme Court Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson.But Jackson on Monday told the Trump administration to inform the Supreme Court by 11 a.m. ET whether it intends to continue to seek a stay of the order. The administration quickly did so, and said it would comply with her directive to file a supplemental brief on the request by 4 p.m. Monday. Plaintiffs in the case were told to respond by 8 a.m. on Tuesday.Separately on Monday, a federal judge in Massachusetts issued an order blocking the Trump administration's memo over the weekend telling states that they had to \"undo\" any full SNAP benefits payments to recipients, or face financial penalties.The ruling Sunday night by a three-judge panel of the 1st Circuit Court of Appeals came a day after the U.S. Department of Agriculture issued that memo.And it came hours after the Senate narrowly passed the first step of a bipartisan deal that might reopen the government within days, and fully fund the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program through next September.\"In reviewing the district court's balancing of the equities, we also cannot ignore the particular events preceding this litigation,\" wrote Circuit Court Judge Julie Rikelman in the panel's decision Sunday. \"As the district court found, 'this is a problem that could have been avoided.'\"\"The record here shows that the government sat on its hands for nearly a month, unprepared to make partial payments, while people who rely on SNAP received no benefits a week into November and counting,\" Rikelman wrote.\"In light of these unique facts, we cannot conclude that the district court abused its discretion in requiring full payment of November SNAP benefits to effectuate the October 31 [temporary restraining order] after the government had failed to comply with it.\"The Trump administration on Oct. 24 broke decades of precedent when it said it would not pay SNAP benefits in November because Congress had not appropriated money for the program, or any other government program, past the date the shutdown began, Oct. 1. Past administrations had paid SNAP benefits in full during other shutdowns.Read more CNBC government shutdown coverageDuffy warns air travel will be ‘reduced to a trickle’ as the shutdown drags onTrump tells Republicans to send health insurance money 'directly to the people'Food banks in ‘disaster response mode’ due to shutdown, SNAP cuts, leaders saySenate Republicans reject Democrat deal to reopen governmentDemocratic leader offers deal to reopen government but Republicans sneerTrump admin asks Supreme Court to block order it pay full SNAP benefitsSNAP benefits must be fully paid by Trump administration by Friday, judge ordersDC sandwich thrower Sean Dunn found not guilty of assaulting federal agentJudge dismisses criminal case against Boeing over Max crashes despite skepticismNancy Pelosi announces retirement from CongressTrump bashes Mamdani after Democrats sweep key electionsSupreme Court justices appear skeptical that Trump tariffs are legalCalifornia voters approve new U.S. House map to boost Democrats in 2026Democrats win big on election night in key racesThe administration rejected the idea of using the remaining $4.6 billion in a contingency fund that Congress had specifically allocated to backstop SNAP.A group of plaintiffs, comprised of nonprofits, local governments, a union and a food retailer, sued the administration in U.S. District Court in Rhode Island seeking a judicial order forcing the administration to use the contingency fund and other pools of money to fully fund SNAP benefits.Judge Jack McConnell, who is overseeing the case, ordered the administration to make at least partial benefits as soon as possible by tapping the contingency fund, and to investigate if other money could be used.McConnell on Thursday ordered that the administration pay full benefits, days after the administration told him it would pay only partial benefits — but that it would take some time to do so — and told him that it had ruled out using so-called Section 32 funds.McConnell ordered that the administration use Section 32 funds to make up the difference between the 65% of benefits the administration planned to pay by using the contingency fund and the full value of the benefits. SNAP benefits cost about $8 billion each month.The administration then asked the 1st Circuit for a temporary stay of McConnell's order on an emergency basis, which the appeals court rejected Friday.But the appeals court at the same time also said it was still considering the \"government's motion for a stay pending appeal [of McConnell's order] ... and we intend to issue a decision on that motion as quickly as possible.\"On Friday night, Jackson, acting on a request by the administration, paused McConnell's order from taking effect and told the 1st Circuit to quickly rule on the request for the stay pending appeal.Jackson's order paused for 48 hours any ruling by the 1st Circuit from taking effect.",

David Ake | Getty ImagesThe Federal Aviation Administration on Monday will \"effectively prohibit business aviation\" at a dozen major U.S. airports, adding to flight restrictions for commercial airlines as air traffic controller shortages snarl travel in the government shutdown, a trade group said.Last week, the Trump administration ordered U.S. commercial airlines to cut their schedules to ease strains on air traffic controllers who are working without their regular paychecks in the shutdown. Government officials at first didn't curb private flights the same way they did for commercial aviation, though the air traffic controller staffing shortages have slowed travel broadly.The first commercial airline flight cuts of 4% went into affect on Friday and are set to rise to 10% of flights by this coming Friday.More than 4,500 commercial flights were canceled over the weekend and over 17,000 were delayed as staffing shortages worsened around the country, according to FlightAware. Aviation industry members applauded the Senate's progress toward ending the shutdown late Sunday, though a solution for the longest-ever such impasse hasn't been finalized.\"Safety is the cornerstone of business aviation, and NBAA is fully committed to ensuring the safety of the NAS,\" said National Business Aviation Association President and CEO Ed Bolen in a statement late Sunday. \"Among the ways we will do that is to ensure business aviation operators have an understanding of these restrictions and their implications.\"Most business jet operators don't use the busiest commercial airports, said the NBAA. The FAA didn't immediately comment.Here are the airports included in the new restrictions, according to the NBAA:Chicago O'Hare International Airport (ORD)Dallas Fort Worth International Airport (DFW)Denver International Airport (DEN)General Edward Lawrence Logan International Airport (BOS)George Bush Intercontinental Airport (IAH)Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport (ATL)John F.

Saul Loeb | Afp | Getty ImagesThe Senate on Monday night passed a bill to fund the federal government through January and end the longest shutdown in U.S. history.The bill, which passed 60-40 with support from a handful of Democratic senators and nearly all Republicans, will be sent to the House of Representatives.If it passes the House, the bill will head to President Donald Trump to be signed into law.Trump earlier Monday said that he supports the funding deal, which was negotiated between Republicans and a gang of moderate Senate Democrats nearly six weeks after the shutdown began on Oct. 1.House Speaker Mike Johnson told his Republican conference earlier Monday that he wanted GOP House members to begin traveling to Washington, D.C., for a vote on the deal.House members were told that votes on the deal could begin by 4 p.m. ET on Wednesday.Before the Senate vote, Johnson refused to commit to the deal's key guarantee to Democrats: that Congress will hold a separate vote in December on potentially extending enhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies. That vote would be on a bill of the Democrats' choosing, according to the Senate agreement.\"I'm not committing to it or not committing to it,\" Johnson, R-La., said on CNN.Read more CNBC government shutdown coverageDuffy warns air travel will be ‘reduced to a trickle’ as the shutdown drags onTrump tells Republicans to send health insurance money 'directly to the people'Food banks in ‘disaster response mode’ due to shutdown, SNAP cuts, leaders saySenate Republicans reject Democrat deal to reopen governmentDemocratic leader offers deal to reopen government but Republicans sneerTrump admin asks Supreme Court to block order it pay full SNAP benefitsSNAP benefits must be fully paid by Trump administration by Friday, judge ordersDC sandwich thrower Sean Dunn found not guilty of assaulting federal agentJudge dismisses criminal case against Boeing over Max crashes despite skepticismNancy Pelosi announces retirement from CongressTrump bashes Mamdani after Democrats sweep key electionsSupreme Court justices appear skeptical that Trump tariffs are legalCalifornia voters approve new U.S. House map to boost Democrats in 2026Democrats win big on election night in key racesThose subsidies, which are due to expire at the end of December, help reduce the cost of individual health insurance plans for more than 20 million Americans.Until Sunday night, when the Senate passed the first stage of the newly negotiated deal, Democratic senators almost without exception refused to vote to reopen the government because the original House Republican bill did not extend the ACA tax credits.Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., angrily condemned the deal on Sunday night for not ensuring that the subsidies will survive into 2026, as many Americans will face much higher insurance prices without them.The Senate deal would fund the government through the end of January; reverse all shutdown-related layoffs of federal employees; and guarantee that all federal workers will be paid their normal salaries during the shutdown.The deal also includes provisions for a bipartisan budget process and prevents the White House from using continuing resolutions to fund the government.CRs have been repeatedly used to avoid government shutdown, but are controversial because they frequently avoid lawmakers having to make decisions about long-term funding of the government that a normal budget would resolve.The deal would also fund, through September, the SNAP program, which helps feed 42 million Americans through food stamps.Under a federal law passed in 2019, government employees who are furloughed during a shutdown must be paid for the time they were out of work at their standard rate of pay \"at the earliest date possible, regardless of scheduled pay dates.\"— CNBC's Emily Wilkins contributed to this story.",

    "body": "Michael Intrator, co-founder and CEO of CoreWeave, speaks at the Semafor World Economy Summit during the International Monetary Fund and World Bank Spring meetings in Washington on April 25, 2025.Kent Nishimura | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesCoreWeave, a provider of infrastructure for artificial intelligence companies, reported better-than-expected third-quarter revenue on Monday, but the company delivered disappointing full-year guidance. The stock dropped 6% in extended trading.Here's how the company did in comparison with LSEG consensus:Earnings: Loss of 22 cents per shareRevenue: $1.36 billion vs. $1.29 billion expectedRevenue in the quarter soared 134% from $583.9 million a year ago, according to a statement. The company reported a net loss of $110 million, narrowing from about $360 million in the same quarter last year.CoreWeave's growth is tied directly to the AI boom, as the company rents out Nvidia graphics processing units and has won business from leading cloud infrastructure providers, including Google and Microsoft. The company's backlog now stands at $55.6 billion, with 2.9 gigawatts in contracted power, up from 2.2 gigawatts on June 30, according to the statement.However, CoreWeave now sees 2025 revenue coming in between $5.05 billion and $5.15 billion, trailing the average analyst estimate of $5.29 billion, according to LSEG.A third-party data center developer is behind schedule, CEO Mike Intrator said on the company's earnings call. But he added that the delay won't affect CoreWeave's backlog.\"There was a problem at one data center that's impacting us, but there are 41 data centers in our portfolio,\" Intrator said.During the quarter, CoreWeave announced a $6.5 billion expansion of its business with OpenAI and a six-year deal with Meta worth up to $14.2 billion. CoreWeave also received its sixth contract from \"a leading hyperscaler.\"The company remains supply-constrained, Intrator said. The shortage is not in power but instead has to do with the availability of partly completed \"powered-shell\" data centers in which CoreWeave can set up its own equipment, he said.Meanwhile, CoreWeave is building its own data center infrastructure from the ground up in Pennsylvania, he said.\"The overwhelming majority of the delay that you're seeing should be taken care of within Q1 of next year.\" Intrator said.CoreWeave went public on the Nasdaq in March, selling shares at $40 each. On Monday the stock closed at $105.61, representing a 164% return. The Nasdaq has gained 32% over a similar period. CoreWeave shares slipped in extended trading on Monday.Less than four months after its IPO, CoreWeave announced its intent to acquire data center infrastructure operator Core Scientific for $9 billion, but Core Scientific shareholders voted against the proposed deal.CoreWeave's 2026 capital expenditures should be \"well in excess of double\" the total for 2025, which will end up between $12 billion and $14 billion, said Nitin Agrawal, the company's finance chief.Correction: Due to misstatement by CoreWeave's CEO, a prior version of this story had an incorrect figure for the number of data centers.

    "body": "Hero Minnie will appear on Disney's newest cruise ship the Disney Destiny.DisneyThe Disney fleet is expanding yet again.Later this month, the Disney Destiny cruise ship will make its maiden voyage from Port Everglades in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, officially becoming the seventh ship in the company's lineup.The Destiny, which is 221 feet tall and 1,119 feet long, can carry 4,000 passengers and 1,555 crew members. For its inaugural season, the ship will offer four- and five-night cruises to the Bahamas and Western Caribbean, including visits to one or both of the company's island destinations, Disney Castaway Cay and Disney Lookout Cay at Lighthouse Point.Like Disney's other cruise ships, the new vessel features themed dining, curated lounges and premium on-board live entertainment. Disney's portfolio of intellectual property has been the bedrock of its theme parks since the very first location opened its doors, and that's translated to its cruise line as well.The Destiny features a heroes and villains theme. Black Panther is the feature character within the Destiny's Grand Hall, a prominent gathering space aboard the vessel, but guests will also be able to interact with iconic Disney villains and anti-heroes like Cruella de Vil, Maleficent, Dr. Facilier, Captain Jack Sparrow and Loki.The Grand Hall of the Disney Destiny features an homage to Marvel's \"Black Panther,\" including a statue of the hero.DisneyThe Destiny sets sail at a time of rapid growth at the Walt Disney Company's experiences division, which includes its theme parks, resorts and cruise line. The company, which hadn't launched a new ship in a decade prior to the Disney Wish's debut in mid-2022, added the Disney Treasure last year and is set to have 13 vessels sailing by 2031.\"We're undergoing the largest expansion in our history,\" Josh D'Amaro, chairman of Disney experiences, told CNBC. \"The Destiny, I think, is just going to be another example of how we continue again to push the envelope on what a cruise experience can be.\"In fiscal 2024, the experiences division posted record revenue and profit, with revenue up 5% for the full year to $34.15 billion and operating income up 4% to $9.27 billion. As of the fiscal third-quarter of 2025, Disney anticipated the experiences segment would see 8% growth in operating income for the current fiscal year. The company reports earnings Thursday.The experiences segment was the second-highest revenue driver for Disney last year behind its entertainment division, which tallied $41.19 billion in fiscal 2024. However, the entertainment segment's operating profits were smaller, at just $3.92 billion.Disney has become a leader in the family cruising space, despite its relatively small number of ships. Its fleet size of just seven ships is dwarfed by the largest cruise lines: Carnival, with more than 100 vessels; Royal Caribbean, with nearly 70; and Norwegian Cruise Line, with more than 30.Disney is considered slightly more expensive than Carnival and Royal Caribbean for base pricing, but if guests choose to upgrade to larger cabins or add food packages or experiences to their itineraries on the major cruise lines, the prices can be similar.Each stateroom aboard the Disney Destiny will showcase custom artwork depicting the epic journeys of famous Disney legends.DisneyDisney's Destiny offers four-night cruises starting at around $2,300 for two adult guests and about $4,000 for a family of four. Five-night cruises start at $2,900 for two adults and $4,700 for a family of four. These prices can increase if travelers select premium rooms or book cruises tied to Halloween or Christmas or for select seven-night cruises aboard the Destiny.Immersive, character-fueled diningLike other cruise ships in the space, the Disney Destiny features upscale restaurants, pools, spas and gaming rooms for kids, but the company injects storytelling into the mix.Additionally, Disney accommodates diners using \"rotational dining\" on its cruise ships. Passengers don't eat in one large mess hall — they are prescheduled to dine at different themed restaurants. Disney rotates the restaurant staff, too, to follow each group of passengers to their scheduled restaurant. As a result, guests have the same servers, busboys and restaurant managers throughout their trip, and the waitstaff gets to know the guests — and their preferences.Among the themed dining halls aboard Destiny is Pride Lands, a feast of the Lion King, which invites guests to dine on a menu with authentic African flavors while live musicians take the stage to present a retelling of Simba's story from cub to king.Pride Lands: Feast of The Lion King is a \"Lion King\"-themed dining experience featuring live musical performances and an African-inspired menu.DisneyAt Worlds of Marvel, families will listen to a mix of hit songs and test their superhero knowledge while they eat. Rocket and Groot from \"Guardians of the Galaxy\" will be featured in an onscreen story that will unfold during the meal. The menu features nods to in-universe locations like Wakanda and the fictional Eastern European nation of Sokovia as well as New York, the home base of the Avengers.A 1923 dining hall, named for the founding year of the Walt Disney Company, celebrates the legacy of Disney's animation. This setting features more than 1,000 drawings, props and other tools of the animation trade, including artwork from \"Hercules,\" \"Sleeping Beauty,\" \"Big Hero 6\" and \"Wreck-It Ralph.\" The menu at 1923 is inspired by the fusion of cultural flavors found throughout California, including Asian, European and South American influences.Guests looking for quick meals and snacks will have a number of other dining options including Cafe Megara and Cafe Merida as well as Edna Á La Mode Sweets, a confectionary with gelato, ice cream, cookies, candies and other specialty treats based on super-suit designer Edna Mode from \"The Incredibles.\"Kid-friendly experiencesFor many, Disney cruises are a family affair.

It is inspired by Marvel's Doctor Strange.Disney\"We're continuing to take intellectual property or franchises, not just from the big screen, but from our theme parks as well,\" D'Amaro said. \"We did that with 'Haunted Mansion' on our last ship, and 'Haunted Mansion' will be back on the Destiny this time, as well. But, you'll also see a 'Pirates of the Caribbean' lounge, for example, which is just gorgeous, and I think our guests are going to respond exceptionally well to it.\"This is the second time that Disney has brought its theme park IP to its cruise line. The Haunted Mansion Parlor debuted on the Disney Treasure last year, and a similar lounge area, featuring ghostly design elements and spooky cocktails, will be on board the Destiny.There's also Cask & Cannon, which is the eclectic but cozy pub inspired by \"Pirates of the Caribbean\" attraction. This is the first time \"Pirates of the Caribbean\" has been brought aboard a Disney ship in this capacity.

Additional ships will launch between 2027 and 2031, bringing the Disney cruise fleet to 13 vessels.\"From a business perspective, the Disney cruise line is very important, not only to the Disney experiences segment, but to the Walt Disney Company,\" D'Amaro said. \"This is a huge brand ambassador for us. So, the ability to take all of the stories that we have to tell and bring them around the world with an asset that moves is very, very powerful for us.\"D'Amaro noted that the segment has seen double-digit returns on its cruise ships and continues to generate high occupancy and strong future bookings.The exterior of Disney's newest cruise ship the Disney Destiny.DisneyBut, Disney's cruise line isn't the only piece of the company's experiences business that is expanding. There are construction plans across the globe for Disney's theme parks and resorts.\"We are in the middle of turbocharging the Disney experiences segment of the Walt Disney Company,\" D'Amaro said. \"So, it's a really special time for this part of the business. We have more projects underway right now than we have ever had in the history of the company.\"The Walt Disney World Resort in Orlando, Florida, is seeing its largest expansion ever at Magic Kingdom with the addition of a villains-themed land and a \"Cars\" area being added in Frontierland.

    "body": "Cooling towers at the Three Mile Island nuclear power plant in Middletown, Pennsylvania, Oct. 30, 2024.Danielle DeVries | CNBCNuclear power will receive most of the money from the Energy Department's loan office as the Trump administration pushes to quickly break ground on new reactors, Secretary Chris Wright said on Monday.\"We have significant lending authority at the loan program office,\" the Secretary of Energy said at a conference hosted by the American Nuclear Society in Washington D.C. \"By far the biggest use of those dollars will be for nuclear power plants — to get those first plants built.\"President Trump signed an executive order in May that called for the U.S. to break ground on 10 large nuclear reactors by 2030. Alphabet, Amazon, Meta Platforms and Microsoft are investing billions of dollars to restart old nuclear plants, upgrade existing ones, and deploy new reactor technology to meet the electricity demand from artificial intelligence data centers.Wright said he expects electricity demand from AI to attract billions of dollars in equity capital to build new nuclear capacity from \"very creditworthy providers.\" The Energy Department could match those private dollars by as much as four to one with low cost debt financing from the loan office, he said.\"When we leave office three years and three months from now, I want to see hopefully dozens of nuclear plants under construction,\" Wright said.Westinghouse dealThe Trump administration struck a deal last month with the owners of Westinghouse to invest $80 billion to build nuclear plants across the U.S. Westinghouse is owned by uranium miner Cameco and Brookfield Asset Management.Westinghouse has designed a modern reactor called the AP1000 that can power more than 750,000 homes. CEO Dan Sumner said in July that Westinghouse would meet Trump's call to build large new plants with the AP1000 design.Cameco Chief Operating Officer Grant Isaac said last week that the U.S. government has a number of options available to facilitate the financing of Westinghouse reactors, including the Energy Department's loan office.\"We're assured that there is a lot of interest in investing this minimum $80 billion in order to begin the process,\" Isaac told investors on Cameco's third-quarter earnings call.Under the terms of the October deal, Westinghouse could spin out as a separate, publicly-traded company with the U.S. government as a shareholder.But Westinghouse has struggled in the past to build the AP1000 on time and on budget. It went bankrupt in 2017 from cost overruns at big nuclear projects in Georgia and South Carolina.Two AP1000 reactors entered service at Plant Vogtle in Georgia in 2023 and 2024, years behind schedule and billions of dollars over budget. The South Carolina project was cancelled.",

    "body": "Warren Buffett will no longer write the letters that accompany his firm, Berkshire Hathaway's annual reports, nor will he field questions at the company's annual shareholder meeting, he wrote in a letter published on Monday.\"As the British would say, I'm 'going quiet,'\" he wrote. \"Sort of.\"Even after Greg Abel takes the reins as Berkshire CEO at yearend, Buffett will continue to share a Thanksgiving message with shareholders — and anyone interested in reading.Interest will no doubt abound. Over his 95 years, Buffett has earned a reputation not only as a legendary investor, but as someone with the secrets to living a better life.In his most recent letter, Buffett took a second to look back and assure his fans that they still have time to do and get the things they want.\"I'm happy to say I feel better about the second half of my life than the first,\" he wrote. \"My advice: Don't beat yourself up over past mistakes — learn at least a little from them and move on. It is never too late to improve.\"Buffett's advice for living wellIn his letter, Buffett riffed on one his longstanding pieces of life advice: Consider your legacy, and work backward.Buffett recalled the story of Alfred Nobel, who reportedly read a mistakenly printed obituary and was horrified at what he saw. The move prompted him to \"change his behavior,\" Buffett wrote — Nobel, previously famous for, among other things, inventing dynamite, came to be associated with his eponymous prize.\"Don't count on a newsroom mix-up: Decide what you would like your obituary to say and live the life to deserve it,\" Buffet wrote.One route, Buffett said, is to imitate those people you most admire: \"Choose your heroes very carefully and then emulate them. You will never be perfect, but you can always be better,\" he wrote.Another way is to refocus your ambitions.\"Greatness does not come about through accumulating great amounts of money, great amounts of publicity or great power in government,\" Buffett wrote. \"When you help someone in any of thousands of ways, you help the world. Kindness is costless but also priceless.\"Regardless of your aims, Buffett wrote, you're unlikely to go wrong following the \"golden rule\" by treating other people, regardless of their station, the way you would want to be treated.\"Keep in mind that the cleaning lady is as much a human being as the Chairman,\" he wrote.Want to level up your AI skills? Sign up for Smarter by CNBC Make It's new online course, How To Use AI To Communicate Better At Work.

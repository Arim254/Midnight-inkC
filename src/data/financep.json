    "body": "File: President Donald Trump looks on after signing an executive order in the Oval Office of the White House on April 9, 2025.Saul Loeb | Afp | Getty ImagesA company controlled by a Chinese national was ordered by U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday to unwind a $2.9 million acquisition of chip assets from a U.S. manufacturer, citing national security concerns.The White House said in an executive order that HieFo Corporation, incorporated in Delaware, was \"controlled by a citizen of the People's Republic of China.\"HieFo acquired the digital chips and related wafer design, fabrication, and processing businesses of New Jersey-based Emcore on April 30, 2024, which included a semiconductor manufacturing facility, the Treasury Department said in a separate statement.The potential diversion of the supply of indium phosphide chips manufactured by Emcore's digital chips business away from the U.S. was also identified as a national security risk, the Treasury Department added.HieFo and Emcore did not immediately respond to a CNBC request for comment.The Global Times, a Chinese government mouthpiece, citing an expert, said the divestment order \"reflects Washington's anxiety over technology competition with China\" as it was made without a convincing rationale.The Treasury Department said the deal was not notified to the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, known as CFIUS, prompting a review by its non-notified transactions team.\"CFIUS identified a national security risk arising from the transaction relating to potential access to EMCORE's intellectual property, proprietary know-how, and expertise,\" the Treasury Department said.HieFo was ordered to divest all acquired assets within 180 days and to immediately restrict access to Emcore's technical information.In a statement dated Sept. 2, 2024, HieFo said the deal would allow operations to continue at Emcore's facility in Alhambra, California, and that it had \"successfully engaged\" nearly all key scientists, engineers and operational staff.HieFo was founded by Genzao Zhang and Harry Moore through a management buyout of wafer fabrication and chip-related assets from Emcore. Both founders list their start dates at HieFo as May 2024 on LinkedIn, when the acquisition closed.The company claimed it had inherited more than 40 years of optoelectronic innovation in indium phosphide chip manufacturing.Emcore manufactures navigation equipment such as gyroscopes and sensors used in commercial, industrial and defense applications, including autonomous navigation and weapons systems, according to its website.The company was delisted from Nasdaq in early 2025 following its merger with aerospace manufacturing holding company Velocity One LP in November 2024.",

    "body": "A general view of the Baidu logo is seen at the Shanghai New Expo Center during the World Artificial Intelligence Conference 2025 in Shanghai, China, on July 28, 2025.Ying Tang | Nurphoto | Getty ImagesChinese tech giant Baidu plans to spin off its artificial intelligence chip subsidiary, Kunlunxin, and list it in Hong Kong, as more domestic chipmakers seek funds amid Beijing's push for semiconductor self-sufficiency.The company said in an announcement Friday that it had confidentially filed a listing application on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, though details of the offering, including size and structure, remain undecided.The move would still require regulatory approvals, including from China's securities watchdog. Baidu emphasized there is no guarantee the spin-off will proceed. The company  reportedly owns about 59% of Kunlunxin.Baidu, a major player in China's growing AI space, is both a buyer of specialized AI chips for data centers and cloud computing, as well as a designer of them through Kunlunxin.The firm said that the spin-off would align with its strategy to highlight Kunlunxin's standalone potential, attract sector-specific investors, and expand financing options. Kunlunxin would remain a Baidu subsidiary, it added.The move comes against a backdrop of intensifying U.S.-China tech tensions. Both Washington and Beijing have imposed various restrictions on Chinese AI companies' access to leading-edge AI chips from California-based Nvidia.Meanwhile, Beijing has increasingly encouraged domestic chip purchases and mobilized billions in public funds towards development. In recent months, several Chinese chipmakers have announced plans to list, including Moore Threads and Biren Technology.A Growing Business FocusFounded in 2012, Kunlunxin is central to Baidu's ambition to become a \"full stack\" AI company, spanning hardware, servers and data centers, as well as AI models and applications.While Baidu still relies heavily on Nvidia's chips for AI computing power, Kunlunxin has enabled the company to increasingly use a mix of its self-developed chips in data centers running its Ernie AI models.Kunlunxin has also shifted to operate as a separate entity, expanding its sales to third-party customers outside Baidu.\"In the market, Kunlunxin is seen as one of the most practical and widely used AI chips in China,\" Brady Wang, associate director at Counterpoint Research, told CNBC. He added that one of the chipmaker's main strengths is in software. \"Instead of forcing users to adopt a closed system, Kunlunxin works well with common AI frameworks and makes it easier to move workloads from [Nvidia].\" Reuters previously reported that Kunlunxin's revenue is projected to exceed 3.5 billion yuan ($500 million) last year, reaching break-even. External sales were expected to account for more than half of its revenue in 2025, the report added. In another sign of strength last year, Kunlunxin won orders worth over 1 billion yuan from suppliers to China Mobile, one of the country's biggest mobile carriers.China Mobile also participated in the entity's latest funding, which had raised over 2 billion yuan and valued the unit at about 21 billion yuan, according to Reuters.In its announcement, Baidu said its plans to spin off and list Kunlunxin would better tie management incentives with performance and elevate the unit's market presence.Late last year, JPMorgan analysts forecast that Kunlunxin's chip sales would increase sixfold to 8 billion Chinese yuan in 2026.However, while Kunlunxin may help reduce China's reliance on chips from Nvidia, it cannot fully replace them, Counterpoint's Wang said, citing Beijing's ongoing constraints in advanced chip manufacturing. \"[Kunlunxin's chips] work best for inference and other workloads that are easier to move, especially for government, telecom, and state-owned cloud users, where stable supply and lower cost matter more than top performance,\" he said. \"Because of this, Beijing is not relying on a single company. Instead, Kunlunxin works together with Huawei Ascend, Cambricon, Alibaba, and others to build a domestic AI computing ecosystem.\"",

    "body": "A turbine blade is lifted onto a rack near tower sections at the Revolution Wind project assembly site at State Pier in New London, Connecticut, US, on Friday, Oct. 24, 2025.Bloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesDanish renewables giant Orsted, the world's largest developer of offshore wind farms, said on Friday that it had launched legal action against the Trump administration over the suspension of its $5 billion Revolution Wind project. Shares of the Copenhagen-listed company rose more than 4% on the news, putting the stock among the top performers of the pan-European Stoxx 600 index.  Orsted said in a statement that it would seek a court injunction against the U.S. government's decision to halt its Revolution Wind project, located about 15 miles south of the Rhode Island coast.\"As was the case with the August 2025 stop-work order, the Revolution Wind Project … faces substantial harm from a continuation of the lease suspension order. As a result, litigation is a necessary step to protect the rights of the Project,\" Orsted said. \"Revolution Wind has spent and committed billions of dollars in reliance upon, and has met the requests of, a thorough review process,\" the company added.The pro-fossil fuel Trump administration suspended leases on Dec. 22 for five large offshore wind projects, including Revolution Wind, citing national security concerns identified by the Pentagon. The move marked the latest in a string of blows against offshore wind developers, with U.S. President Donald Trump having previously described wind turbines as \"ugly\" and an economic and environmental \"disaster.\" Revolution Wind is a 50/50 joint venture between Orsted and Global Infrastructure Partners' Skyborn Renewables. In a filing last year, Orsted and Skyborn Renewables said they had already spent approximately $5 billion on the project.",

    "body": "Google CEO Sundar Pichai waves as he arrives at the Artificial Intelligence Action Summit at the Grand Palais in Paris, Feb. 11, 2025.Benoit Tessier | ReutersAfter a tough start to the year, Google closed out 2025 with its strongest performance — from Wall Street's perspective — since 2009, when the company's shares doubled coming out of the financial crisis. Alphabet's stock popped 65% for the year, slightly ahead of its gains in 2021. The shares hit their 2025 low in April, as President Donald Trump was threatening massive tariffs on trading partners, but they've since jumped over 100%. Among the eight tech companies valued at over $1 trillion, Alphabet was by far the biggest gainer. The next sharpest rallies came from chipmakers Broadcom and Nvidia, which gained 49% and 39%, respectively. Stock Chart IconStock chart iconAlphabet vs. the Nasdaq in 2025Getting to this point required Google to stare down the skeptics, who questioned whether the search giant could maintain its dominance in the artificial intelligence era. With OpenAI's ChatGPT and Sora services capturing an increasing amount of consumer engagement and concerns swirling around the future of online advertising in a world of AI chatbots and agents, Google's business model was viewed as a target for major disruption. Alphabet's 18% plunge in the first quarter was its worst period for the stock since mid-2022. But the mood started to improve in the second quarter. In April, the company promoted 16-year company veteran Josh Woodward to run the Gemini app, Google's answer to ChatGPT. In August, Woodward's group debuted image generator Nano Banana, a Gemini feature that lets users turn to AI to generate images. The feature went viral at launch when people used it to blend multiple photos together to create personal digitized figurines. By the end of the following month, the Gemini app surpassed 5 billion images and dethroned OpenAI's ChatGPT at the top of Apple's App Store. Google's AI talent pool deepened over the summer, when the company announced an agreement to bring in Varun Mohan, co-founder and CEO of AI coding startup Windsurf, along with other senior research and development employees from the high-profile startup that had previously been in talks with OpenAI for a $3 billion acquisition. That deal fell apart, and Google ended up agreeing to pay $2.4 billion in licensing fees and for compensation to snag Windsurf's top engineers. Winning in AI and in courtSoon thereafter, Google was handed a gift in the courtroom.Despite losing its antitrust case last year, as Google was found to hold an illegal monopoly in internet search, U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta ruled in September against the most severe consequences that were proposed by the Justice Department. Google would not have to divest Chrome and could still make payments to companies to preload products, meaning it could continue paying Apple billions of dollars to be the default search engine on iPhones. One consequence of the ruling is that Google would have to share certain data with competitors. Gemini's momentum has been the biggest story.Last month, Google announced Gemini 3, an upgraded AI model, almost eight months after rolling out Gemini 2.5.While Gemini still trails ChatGPT in overall usage, it's been rapidly making up ground. According to data this month from Similarweb, ChatGPT's share of generative AI traffic dropped to about 68% from 87% a year earlier, while Gemini jumped to roughly 18% from about 5% over that stretch. watch nowAnalysts at Citizens wrote in a Tuesday report that the critical development for Alphabet isn't just about Gemini but the effect of the company's AI investments on the core search business. AI Overviews is Google's search-embedded service that provides AI-powered summaries for user queries. The Citizens analysts said the \"incorporation of updated models is improving the relevance of answers, which we view as a further tailwind to engagement.\"\"We come away believing Google can further accelerate search revenue in 4Q25, which we view as the key question near term,\" wrote the analysts, who recommend buying the shares even after the latest rally. Analysts have also highlighted Google's broad strength in cloud computing, where it's chasing Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure, and the company's leadership in robotaxis through Waymo as potential catalysts heading into 2026. Still, with investors piling into the stock, expectations are sky-high. Analysts project fourth-quarter revenue growth of 15% to over $111 billion when Alphabet next reports results, according to LSEG, and growth throughout next year is expected to be in the low teens.In October, Alphabet raised its capital spending forecast for 2025 to as high as $93 billion, up from $85 billion. Analysts see that number jumping to more than $114 billion in 2026, according to FactSet. CEO Sundar Pichai has repeatedly said the company is responding to soaring demand. He said on the October earnings call that Google's cloud business signed more deals over $1 billion in 2025 through the third quarter than in the two prior years combined. Analysts at Pivotal Research warned in a note to clients earlier this month that should OpenAI, one of Google's key customers, cut its spending or face other issues due to its mounting obligations, \"it is likely to temporarily get pretty ugly for AI stocks and the market in general.\"But the Pivotal analysts have a buy rating on the stock and raised their price target by $50, to $400, about 28% above Wednesday's closing price of $313.\"We believe the shakeout, if it happens, will mirror 2000 and will inevitably be a healthy weeding out process leaving fewer much more dominant competitors, with GOOG leading the way,\" they wrote. — CNBC's Jennifer Elias contributed to this report.

    "body": "watch nowWarren Buffett said Berkshire Hathaway is better positioned than any company to endure over the long term as he handed over the CEO reins to his successor Greg Abel, whom he strongly endorsed. \"It has a better chance I think of being here 100 years from now than any company I can think of,\" Buffett told Becky Quick in a special interview, parts of which aired on CNBC Friday.The full interview with Buffett will air on CNBC Tuesday, Jan. 13 at 7 p.m. ET.Buffett officially relinquished the CEO role to Abel Thursday, ending a six-decade legendary run at the helm that turned a struggling textile mill into a trillion-dollar conglomerate with varied businesses from insurance companies to railroads with over $300 billion in cash on the balance sheet. \"Greg will be the decider,\" Buffett said.

    "body": "Fire at Fuerte Tiuna, Venezuela's largest military complex, is seen from a distance after a series of explosions in Caracas on Jan. 3, 2026.Str | Afp | Getty ImagesU.S. President Donald Trump said Saturday the United States conducted a large-scale strike in Venezuela that resulted in the capture and removal of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro.Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, were captured and removed from the country following the operation, which was conducted in coordination with U.S. law enforcement authorities, Trump said in an early morning post on Truth Social. \"The United States of America has successfully carried out a large scale strike against Venezuela and its leader, President Nicolas Maduro, who has been, along with his wife, captured and flown out of the Country. This operation was done in conjunction with U.S. Law Enforcement,\" Trump said.No further details were provided.CBS News reported that the U.S. Army's elite Delta Force unit was involved in the capture of Maduro. The Pentagon declined to answer CNBC's queries and referred questions to the White House.Republican Senator Mike Lee of Utah, who had earlier questioned whether the U.S. attack was constitutional, said in a X post on Saturday that Secretary of State Marco Rubio told him the U.S. operation \"was deployed to protect and defend those executing the arrest warrant.\"\"This action likely falls within the president's inherent authority under Article II of the Constitution to protect U.S. personnel from an actual or imminent attack,\" Lee added.U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Christopher Landau said in a post on X that Maduro would \"finally face justice for his crimes.\"watch nowThere was no immediate confirmation from the Venezuelan government. Delcy Rodríguez, Venezuela's vice president, demanded that the U.S. provide proof that Maduro and his wife are alive, in an interview on state television station Venezolana de Televisión.Maduro's official Facebook page posted a video stating that attacks occurred in the states of Miranda, Aragua and La Guaira, according to a Google translation of the Spanish-language statement.The statement in the video added that the U.S. would fail in its goal of possessing Venezuela's oil and minerals, and that Maduro had declared a national emergency and mobilized defense forces.The official spokesperson for Nobel Peace Prize winner Maria Corina Machado, who leads the  Venezuelan opposition, said in a post on X that it had no comment on the operation.Trump told The New York Times that the operation was a result of \"a lot of good planning.\" \"It was a brilliant operation, actually,\" Trump told the Times.Explosions were reported in the Venezuelan capital, Caracas, at about 2 a.m. local time (0600 GMT), according to images circulating on social media that could not be independently verified.The Russian Foreign Ministry condemned the U.S. operation, saying that \"the pretexts used to justify such actions are untenable.\"\"We support the statement by the Venezuelan authorities and the leadership of Latin American countries on the urgent convening of a meeting of the UN Security Council,\" the statement said.Trump has repeatedly threatened action against Maduro. On Dec. 23, 2025, he said it would be \"smart\" for Maduro to leave power.Trump last month announced a blockade of sanctioned oil tankers moving in and out of Venezuelan waters, saying the country was \"completely surrounded by the largest Armada ever assembled in the History of South America.\"The strategy to pressure Maduro comes as the U.S. and Venezuela's opposition say Maduro rigged an election last year to stay in power. Trump has also accused Maduro of running a \"narco-state.\"Colombian President Gustavo Petro said in a post on X that Caracas was under attack and urged an emergency meeting of the Organization of American States and the United Nations.Maduro, who succeeded Hugo Chavez in 2013, has said Washington is seeking control of its oil reserves, the largest in the world.This is breaking news.

Israel's Mossad spy agency issued a direct call on December 31, 2025,urging Iranians to press on with protests, saying it was supporting them \"on the ground\" as demonstrations spread in capital Tehran and other Iranian cities.  Protests began on December 28, 2025, with Tehran shopkeepers rallying against Iran's worsening economy have spread to other cities, drawing in students as well. (Photo by ATTA KENARE / AFP via Getty Images)Atta Kenare | Afp | Getty ImagesPresident Donald Trump said Friday that if Iran \"violently\" intervenes with peaceful protests, then the U.S. will \"come to their rescue.\"Unrest has been growing in Iran since last week, as protests erupted over the government's handling of a sharp fall in the nation's currency and soaring prices. Annual inflation hit 42.2% in December, with food prices jumping 72%. The protests turned violent this week as local media reported the death of at least six civilians.\"If Iran shots and violently kills peaceful protesters, which is their custom, the United States of America will come to their rescue,\" Trump wrote in a post on Truth Social on Friday.\"We are locked and loaded and ready to go,\" he added.Iran's supreme leader adviser Ali Larijani responded by saying that U.S. interference in Iran's protests was equivalent to chaos across the entire region on Friday, in comments reported by Reuters.watch nowSuzanne Maloney, vice president and director of foreign policy at the Brookings Institution, previously said that the Iranian people were calling for not just a fix to the economy, but for regime change. She added that Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has been in power for 36 years.\"We're hearing cries of Death to the dictator. We're hearing slogans that juxtapose the regime's support for militia groups across the region with the real interests and demands of the Iranian people,\" Maloney told CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" on Wednesday.Iran's economy has struggled since Trump pulled the U.S. out of the Iranian nuclear deal in 2018 and re-imposed sanctions on the country. Last year in June, U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear sites escalated tensions, pulling Washington into Israel's war with its longtime regional rival.Earlier this week, Trump threatened additional military action against Iran if the country attempts to build up its reserves of ballistic weapons and reestablish its nuclear program.\"Now, I hear that Iran is trying to build up again, and if they are we're going to have to knock them down. We'll knock them down. We'll knock the hell out of them. But hopefully that's not happening,\" Trump said on Monday.Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian responded on Tuesday in a post on X, saying that the response of the Islamic Republic of Iran to any \"oppressive aggression will be harsh and regrettable.\"  Foreign policy has dominated Trump's schedule in recent weeks. On Tuesday, the U.S. announced sanctions on a group of 10 individuals and entities based in Iran and Venezuela that are allegedly linked to the weapons trade between the two countries.— CNBC's Justin Papp contributed to this report.",

But concerns about President Donald Trump's trade war, skittish consumers and an oversupply of domestic seats brought U.S. airfare down and weighed on industry profits.\"It's the airline version of the K-shaped economy. Monetize the top of the K and minimize the shortfall at the bottom,\" said Robert Mann, who has worked at several airlines and is president of aviation consulting firm R.W. Mann & Co. Now, the leaders of the country's biggest airlines are putting even more focus on customers who will pay extra for their tickets in exchange for a little more space or other perks like earlier boarding and access to never-sufficient overhead bin space.The view into American Airlines first-class cabin on a Boeing 737.Leslie Josephs/CNBCThey still face continued problems, like a shortage of air traffic controllers and aging infrastructure. Despite billions of additional federal spending to fix some of the problems, major improvements will take years.Mann said airlines need to do more to improve reliability. U.S. carriers had a 77% on-time rate, according to the Department of Transportation, which defines on-time as arrival within 15 minutes of the schedule.\"When the flight is late or canceled, it doesn't matter if you're at the top of the K or the bottom of the K,\" he said.Here's how the next year is shaping up for the airline industry:Winners take (almost) allThrough the first nine months of the year, Delta and United Airlines accounted for nearly all of U.S. airline profits. It's an industry divide that's been brewing for years, further fueled by a surge in costs and shifting consumer tastes as wealthier travelers have increased their share of overall spending.While the economy has been resilient for the most part, any weakening in 2026 could have an outsize effect on more price-sensitive consumers and, therefore, airlines that are more exposed to coach-class domestic travel, like lower-cost carriers.Those airlines have been making moves of their own. JetBlue Airways, for example, has been shifting its focus to more profitable routes and premium seats. It plans to debut a domestic business class in mid-2026 with seats up at the front of the cabin that are roomier but not quite as elaborate as its top-tier lie-flat Mint suites. Stable faresAirfare will likely remain steady next year over 2025, according to an American Express Global Business Travel forecast in mid-November. Demand has rebounded after dropping during a record-long government shutdown, but it's not clear whether 2026 will be a blockbuster.Southwest Airlines CEO Bob Jordan told CNBC in December that the \"first quarter looks strong\" but that \"it's hard to say,\" whether it will be better than a year ago.Read more CNBC airline newsAmerican Airlines no longer lets basic economy flyers earn milesArchitect of Delta's premium strategy to retire in FebruaryFrontier Airlines replaces longtime CEO Barry Biffle with carrier's presidentSouthwest CEO says airline 'actively pursuing' network of airport loungesWhither SpiritStruggling budget travel icon Spirit Airlines is in its second bankruptcy in less than a year after a court-blocked acquisition by JetBlue, an engine grounding, a surge in costs and other problems, raising questions about its ability to survive. Industry insiders and airline analysts have said the yellow-plane airline will have to make much bigger moves with this bankruptcy.\"We do not expect it to remain a standalone company this time next year, with a merger or Chapter 7 outcome likely to drive upside to our earnings forecast,\" said a Raymond James note on Dec. 19.watch nowAnalysts expect that merger partner would be Frontier Airlines, the fellow budget airline that has attempted to combine with Spirit repeatedly since 2022, but it's not clear whether the two sides will reach a deal. Spirit said earlier this month that it's in \"active negotiations\" for a stand-alone reorganization or a transaction. Frontier and Spirit declined to comment further. Southwest transformedSouthwest's preparing for a major change in 2026. The airline's decades-long cattle call will end on Jan. 27 when assigned seating begins. It's coming off a slew of changes it already put into place last year. It debuted extra legroom seats that command higher prices and started charging many customers to check bags for the first time, a service that brought in more than $7 billion for its U.S. rivals in 2024, the last full year of available data, according to the Transportation Department.The carrier's stock is the top gainer of U.S. passenger airlines. Southwest shares rose nearly 23% in 2025 compared with the NYSE Arca Airline Index's 5% advance, and beat out profit leaders Delta and United as well as the broader market.Investors have been bullish on the company's transformation to a more traditional, segmented airline, which has been sped along by a stake from activist investor Elliott Investment Management.American makeoverAmerican is expanding its lounges and launching a fleet of Airbus 321XLR planes in 2026 as it aims to catch up in the luxury travel boom. Free inflight Wi-Fi is also coming for loyalty program members starting in January, American said last spring.The airline already made more minor changes, like adding Lavazza coffee for all its passengers and Champagne Bollinger for its top-tier lounges and cabins, to uplift its brand as well, but it has a long path to reach Delta's and United's profitability.American Airlines and Delta planes on the tarmac at LaGuardia Airport (LGA) in the Queens borough of New York, US, on Friday, Nov. 7, 2025.Michael Nagle | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesJust before Christmas, American also announced that it will no longer award customers on its no-frills basic economy tickets with frequent flyer miles, following a similar move by Delta several years ago. American hasn't yet announced changes to its elite status requirements for 2027, but the carrier is under pressure because Delta and United have said they will hold status thresholds steady.The airline is also making some changes that aim to improve reliability, recently announcing it will increase so-called banks, or clusters of flights at its largest hub, Dallas Fort Worth International Airport, from nine to 13.American also said it is testing out two electronic gates there, where passengers on narrow-body domestic flights scan their own boarding passes, in hopes of getting travelers on planes faster, and in September, it said it will remove bag sizers from gates.",

Citadel's fundamental equity strategy returned 14.5%, while its global fixed income fund advanced 9.4%.Citadel declined to comment. The S&P 500 locked in a 16.4% gain for the year, its third straight double-digit annual advance. That marks an impressive recovery from the rout seen in early April following President Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs announcement. At one point, the S&P 500 was even on the cusp of closing in bear market territory.The hedge fund plans to return about $5 billion of profits earned this year to clients in an effort to limit capital growth, CNBC's Leslie Picker previously reported. The move is expected to reduce assets under management to about $67 billion from roughly $72 billion.Wellington's long-term track record remains strong as the fund has generated an annualized return of 19% since its inception in 1990, the person said.",

    "body": "Warren Buffett and Greg Abel at the Berkshire Hathaway Annual Shareholders Meeting in Omaha, Nebraska, May 3, 2025.David A. Grogen | CNBCBerkshire Hathaway shares slipped Friday as investors digested the formal end of Warren Buffett's six-decade tenure as chief executive and the start of a new era under successor Greg Abel.Class A shares fell 1.4% on Abel's first day as CEO, following Buffett's official handoff of the role and the close of one of the most storied leadership tenures in corporate history. The Omaha-based conglomerate ended 2025 with a gain of 10.9%, trailing the S&P 500's 16.4% advance but marking its 10th consecutive year of positive returns. Buffett, 95, remains chairman and has sought to reassure shareholders that Berkshire's future extends well beyond his tenure.\"It has a better chance, I think, of being here 100 years from now than any company I can think of,\" Buffett said in a special interview with CNBC. Abel takes over as Berkshire sits on a record $381.6 billion in cash as of the end of September, following an extended period of net equity selling. Buffett has said Abel will have final authority over capital allocation decisions.\"Greg will be the decider,\" Buffett said. I \"can't imagine how much more he can get accomplished in a week than I can in a month .... I'd rather have Greg handling my money than any of the top investment advisors or any of the top CEOs in the United States.\"Berkshire shares lagged the broader market after Buffett announced his retirement in May, as some investors weighed whether Abel could oversee the conglomerate's vast operating businesses and equity portfolio with the same touch, while still justifying a premium valuation.Buffett departs with an unmatched record. After taking control of Berkshire in the mid-1960s, he turned a struggling textile maker into a compounding powerhouse. From 1964 through 2024, Berkshire delivered a compounded annual gain of 19.9%, nearly double the S&P 500's 10.4%, resulting in an overall return of more than 5.5 million percent.",

(Photo by: Michael Siluk/UCG/Universal Images Group via Getty Images)Ucg | Universal Images Group | Getty ImagesNovo Nordisk's shift from a market darling to a serious underperformer has set the stage for a transitional 2026 as the Danish drugmaker fights to regain investor confidence in its weight loss business.Novo's stock just experienced the worst year on record since it began trading on the Copenhagen stock exchange over three decades ago. Multiple reasons lie behind the dramatic drop: a series of guidance cuts, strides by chief rival Eli Lilly, a leadership upheaval, and cheap copycat drugs flooding the crucial U.S. market.With just about a week to go until 2026, Novo announced that its new weight loss pill under the brand name Wegovy had been approved in the U.S., making it the first oral GLP-1 treatment approved for weight loss. It sent shares up nearly 10% as investors banked on Novo being able to, at least partly, hold Eli Lilly and others at bay.That \"early Christmas present,\" as one analyst called it, highlights many of the key themes Novo will have to face this year.From injectables to pillsNovo's position as the first company to launch an oral option could help it make up some of the ground it's lost over the past year in the GLP-1 space. Analysts mostly agreed that the Wegovy pill's approval was a big deal, even though many had already expected a positive decision before the end of the year. Eli Lilly is expected to get its own weight loss pill orforglipron approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration by no later than the second quarter of this year, and investors will closely watch how that competition plays out.watch now\"This approval adds a layer to the whole obesity space in the future,\" Sydbank analyst Søren Løntoft Hansen told CNBC. \"It could be, potentially, a space where Novo Nordisk is maybe able to recapture market shares and maybe increase growth.\"Wegovy-in-a-pill, as Novo calls the oral version of the blockbuster injectable, has shown that patients lose on average 16.6% of their body weight over 64 weeks. Meanwhile, orforglipron, averages 12.4% over 72 weeks.\"Usually, you have to basically go for either convenience or efficacy when you're discussing pills versus injections – not in this case,\" Novo CEO Mike Doustdar told CNBC's Charlotte Reed in November. \"Wegovy in a pill basically will have the same efficacy as its injectable counterpart. That's really exciting.\"The broad consensus is that pills will also be favored by consumers. They have added advantages such as not having to be stored cold like the injectable version, allowing for simpler distribution and ease of entering new markets.A shifting narrative?Eli Lilly's positioning of its rival drug Zepbound as the best treatment for achieving weight loss on the market for once-weekly injections has helped it succeed in capturing significant market share to surpass Novo's Wegovy.Meanwhile, Novo Nordisk's positioning has been different as they've often emphazised that treating obesity goes beyond losing weight. \"They want to tell a story about how obesity should be seen as a disease and how Wegovy affects obesity-related diseases,\" Sydbank's Hansen said.\"As we will build and buy assets, you will often see that these assets do multiple things,\" Doustdar said in early November. \"They address other co-morbidities. We have seen that with semaglutide; it helps liver, kidney, heart – that's fantastic – we should actually go and further develop those,\" he said in the context of the future focus of its pipeline.However, it seems that's not important to Americans or the market, according to Hansen. \"The fraction that prescribes Wegovy or obesity drugs in relation to obesity-related diseases is very small,\" he noted, adding that even if many patients don't necessarily want to lose more than 20% of their body weight, they at least want the opportunity to achieve that highest rate of weight loss.\"It seems like that drives the market, and if Novo Nordisk is able to tap into that story with the Wegovy pill, I think they are in a good place,\" Hansen said.Read moreNovo in late November said it filed for FDA approval of a higher dose of Wegovy injection of 7.2 mg, which could also play into a changing narrative. Trials have shown that the higher dose of Wegovy resulted in a 20.7% weight reduction on average — about the same as Lilly's Zepbound jab.The U.S. consumerThe increased focus on the direct-to-consumer market will be another key area to watch.The market for weight loss pharmaceuticals is uniquely consumer-driven, contrasting many other blockbuster drugs that are typically covered by health plans in the U.S. or national health systems in Europe.\"The marketable development for Wegovy and Ozempic is a must-win battle for [CEO] Mike Doustdar and the new board.\"Søren Løntoft HansenSydbank analystPresident Donald Trump's second term in office has brought several headaches for pharmaceutical companies, Novo included. Throughout the year, Trump has teased triple-digit tariffs unless pharma companies make significant investments in the U.S., and has also waged a war on high drug prices for Americans.The frustration that U.S. drug prices can be more than four times those in Europe isn't new. Last year, Novo's then-CEO Lars Fruergaard Jørgensen testified at the U.S. Senate panel chaired by Sen. Bernie Sanders, who called for the company to \"stop ripping us off\" with high drug prices.But Trump has taken it further, advocating a so-called \"Most Favored Nation\" pricing for medicines, whereby the U.S. price is set to the lowest level compared to other wealthy countries.In November, the Trump administration reached a deal with Novo and Lilly to lower prices of their bestselling GLP-1 medicines on both Medicare and Medicaid, as well as agreements to offer them directly to consumers at a discount on the website TrumpRx.gov, which is set to be launched in January this year.The new direct-to-patient market is emerging as a critical driver of future sales growth, but compounders — which make cheaper copycat versions of the drug and were able to flourish during the earlier shortage of semaglutide — remain a real competitor.\"The TrumpRx deal will help Novo become more competitive with compounders on price, although a faster orforglipron launch could reduce its ability to gain momentum in the [direct-to-patient] channel ahead of Lilly,\" noted Morningstar's Karen Andersen.\"We've already seen the direct-to-patient market beginning to develop nicely in 2025, particularly for LillyDirect… oral GLP-1 drugs will be even better suited to this channel,\" she added. \"That will further push the market toward cash pay.\"Headwinds Investors are also waiting to see if Novo's new leadership will deliver on its attempt to improve U.S. operations.In May, Novo ousted its CEO of eight years, citing \"recent market challenges\" and \"the development of the company's share price.\" Six months later, all independent members of the board stepped down due to a disagreement with Novo's controlling shareholder over the pace of change and discontent over how it had addressed challenges in the U.S. market.\"The marketable development for Wegovy and Ozempic is a must-win battle for [CEO] Mike Doustdar and the new board,\" Hansen said, adding that the development in the U.S. market is a \"show me case\" for investors. \"Right now, we really don't see any significant positive progress here,\" he told CNBC on Dec 23.The Danish drugmaker must therefore balance progress on its pill version and higher-dose jabs of Wegovy with these multiple headwinds in 2026. Lower pricing for both the Medicare and consumer cash-pay channel as a result of MFN, as well as patent expiries in jurisdictions including Brazil, Canada and China will \"probably lead to a decreasing top line,\" said Hansen.Furthermore, 2026 will likely bring more clarity on Novo's next-generation drug CagriSema, which combines semaglutide, a GLP-1 agonist, with cagrilintide, an amylin analogue.watch nowLonger term, competition is likely to intensify beyond Lilly and compounders, as several drugmakers — including Pfizer, Amgen, AstraZeneca, Roche — advance late-stage candidates through their pipelines.The future could also bring more diversification in treatments, as many new drugs are in development that could yield new ways to manage weight loss long-term, provide better safety profiles, and combine drugs that target several different appetite-modifying hormones.\"There have been so many moves this year that show Novo as a conflicted company – for example, reaching a deal with Hims and then terminating the deal… negotiating to acquire Metsera, exiting negotiations, and then jumping back in after a signed Pfizer deal,\" said Andersen.\"This [Wegovy pill approval] win is symbolically very important for Novo, after a series of disappointments with data and financial performance,\" she added. \"It needed a win, and now it just needs to execute.\"",

    "body": "Trader Peter Tuchman wears \"2026\" glasses as traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange at the opening bell on Dec. 31, 2025.Timothy A. Clary | Afp | Getty ImagesThe new year is starting off with the stock market looking as split as it did last year. The first trading day of 2026 kicked off Friday, with the stock market as bifurcated as it had been in recent months. Though the S&P 500 started the session higher, carried aloft by semiconductors, it has since sputtered and turned lower as the day wore on. The broad market index was last down by 0.1%. A look inside the S&P 500 shows a major division. Five sectors in the broad market index are higher, led by industrials, energy and utilities that were each higher by more than 1%. Six sectors were lower, led by consumer discretionary and communication services. The day's trading is a continuation of a theme that has gained strength in recent months. While the bull market rally of the last three years has been defined by artificial intelligence, traders, nervous tech stocks will find an uphill climb more difficult in 2026, started rotating into other groups. Indeed, the Nasdaq Composite, known for its heavy exposure toward tech companies, ended last year with two straight months of losses.  Many strategists called for a broadening out of the stock market, with companies more sensitive to the economic cycle taking the mantle from tech to lead the market in 2026. They viewed that as a healthy development to extend the bull market.But that could mean an advance for the overall index is harder to come by. Broadly speaking, according to the 2026 CNBC Market Strategist Survey, Wall Street expects the S&P 500 will climb by roughly 11% in 2026 — a respectable rise that nevertheless falls short of the advance of the last three.Others on the Street are more nervous. On Wednesday, Bank of America strategist Savita Subramanian noted the S&P 500 is expensive, meaning \"risks to the index abound in 2026.\" The strategist's 7,100 year-end target for the S&P 500 is among the lowest of those surveyed. Elsewhere, Adam Parker, founder of Trivariate Research, told CNBC's \"Squawk on the Street\" this past week that the level of optimism on the Street has him nervous for 2026. \"I think the consensus is pretty bullish,\" Parker said. \"You're betting on strong earnings growth, and I don't know if that's as likely.\" Within the tech trade, chip stocks were the lone bright spot. As of midday trading, Nvidia was the only name among the Magnificent Seven companies to rise, up by 1.5%. The VanEck Semiconductor ETF gained nearly 3%. Micron rallied more than 7%, while AMD rose more than 3%. ",

    "body": "watch nowDemocratic Socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders and right-wing Gov. Ron DeSantis agree on virtually nothing. But they found common ground this year as leading skeptics of the artificial intelligence industry's data center boom. The alignment of two national figures on the left and right signals that a political reckoning is brewing over the AI industry's impact on electricity prices, grid stability and the labor market. The opposition could slow the industry's development plans if it reaches a broad bipartisan consensus. Sanders, I-VT, has called for a national moratorium on data center construction. \"Frankly, I think you've got to slow this process down,\" Sanders told CNN in a Dec. 28 interview. \"It's not good enough for the oligarchs to tell us it's coming — you adapt. What are they talking about? They're going to guarantee healthcare to all people? What are they going to do when people have no jobs?\"Florida Gov. DeSantis unveiled an AI bill of rights on Dec. 4 that would protect local communities' right to block data center construction among other provisions. The staunch Republican's proposal could run afoul of the White House, which is pushing to scale up AI as quickly as possible. President Donald Trump issued an executive order on Dec. 11 to prevent \"excessive state regulation\" of AI.\"We have a limited grid. You do not have enough grid capacity in the United States to do what they're trying to do,\" DeSantis said of the AI industry's data center plans at an event in The Villages, Florida. \"As more and more information has gotten out, do you want a hyperscale data center in The Villages? Yes or no,\" the governor asked. \"I think most people would say they don't want it.\" DeSantis is finishing out his second term as Florida's governor and his future political ambitions are unclear. Sanders has said his fourth term as Vermont's senator will likely be his last. Florida and Vermont are not major data center states. But rising utility bills played a key role in the landslide victory of Democrat Abigail Spanberger in the governor's race this year in Virginia, the world's largest data center market. Residential electricity prices are forecast to rise another 4% on average nationwide in 2026 after increasing about 5% in 2025, according to the federal Energy Information Administration. With cost of living at the center of American politics, the impact of data centers on local communities will likely play a role in the mid-term elections next November. \"We have gone from a period where data centers were sort of seen as an unmitigated good and as an engine of growth by a lot of elected officials and policymakers to people now recognizing that we're short,\" said Abe Silverman, who served as general counsel for the public utility board in New Jersey from 2019 until 2023 under Democrat Gov. Phil Murphy. \"We do not have enough generation to reliably serve existing customers and data centers,\" Silverman said. Crisis on the biggest gridThe shortage is most acute on the nation's largest grid, PJM Interconnection, where data center demand is pushing the system to a tipping point. The grid will be six gigawatts short of its reliability requirement by 2027, according to PJM. The power shortage is nearly equivalent to the electricity demand of Philadelphia, Silverman said. This makes blackouts more likely, he said. \"Instead of a blackout happening every one in 10 years, we're looking at something more often,\" the analyst said. \"It's at a crisis stage right now. PJM has never been this short,\" said Joe Bowring, president of Monitoring Analytics, which serves as the independent market monitor for PJM.  PJM Interconnection serves more than 65 million people across 13 states in the Mid-Atlantic and Midwest. It includes pivotal swing states for the mid-term elections like Pennsylvania and Virginia. The price to secure power capacity in PJM has exploded in recent years with $23 billion attributable to data centers, according to watchdog Monitoring Analytics. Those costs are ultimately passed on to consumers. This amounts to a \"massive wealth transfer,\" the watchdog told PJM in a November letter.  \"I don't think we've seen the end of the political repercussions,\" said Rob Gramlich, president of Grid Strategies, a power sector consulting firm. \"And with a lot more elections in 2026 than 2025, we'll see a lot of implications,\" Gramlich said. \"Every politician is going to be saying that they have the answer to affordability and their opponents' policies would raise rates.\" The shortage will be exacerbated by Trump's recent decision to pause all offshore wind farms under construction off the East Coast, Silverman said. This includes Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind, a massive 2.6 gigawatt project that would help supply the huge data center market in northern Virginia.\"By stopping a project that had line of sight to coming online in the very near future, you are directly increasing the prices that we all pay for electricity and not by a little bit,\" Silverman said. \"That's a huge, huge additional hole that we now have to dig out of.\"Data centers are facing pushback on multiple fronts now. The PJM watchdog has called for the grid to reject data centers that it does not have the power to serve or require them to bring their own generation. Virginia's utility regulator is now requiring data centers to pay a majority of the cost of new transmission and generation that serves them beginning in 2027. Data center developers next year will likely start moving to build more power plants onsite, called co-location, as they struggle to secure supply on the grid quickly, said Brian Fitzsimons, CEO of GridUnity, a company that uses software to help utilities navigate connection requests. But Silverman said \"co-location\" has problems that will also face political scrutiny.  \"Co-location is effectively taking a generator off the market,\" he said. \"It would be unethical to end up with a situation where data centers are able to buy private power plants that expose the rest of us to a greater chance of blackouts.\" ",

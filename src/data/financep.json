Michael Nagle | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesInternational Business Machines stock is getting slammed, becoming the latest victim of rapidly developing AI technology, after Anthropic's Claude announced COBOL capabilities. Shares of IBM fell 11% in Monday afternoon trading after Anthropic outlined a new use case for its Claude Code product: automating the exploration and analysis work that drives most of the complexity in COBOL modernization.COBOL, short for Common Business-Oriented Language, is a decades-old programming language used widely in business data processing, which is a core business area for IBM. COBOL continues to power systems responsible for large volumes of transactions, including payment processing and retail transaction systems, making it a prime target for cost-efficient AI disruption. In a Monday blog post, Anthropic wrote that COBOL handles an estimated 95% of ATM transactions in the U.S., for example. \"Hundreds of billions of lines of COBOL run in production every day, powering critical systems in finance, airlines, and government. Despite that, the number of people who understand it shrinks every year,\" the Anthropic blog post reads. \"AI excels at streamlining the tasks that once made COBOL modernization cost-prohibitive.\"It then explained that Claude Code can help modernize COBOL codebases by mapping dependencies across thousands of lines of code, documenting workflows and identifying risks that \"would take human analysts months to surface.\" \"Legacy code modernization stalled for years because understanding legacy code cost more than rewriting it. AI flips that equation,\" the blog post says.IBM is the latest stock to fall on AI fears, which have rattled investors in recent weeks and contributed to a volatile \"sell first and ask questions later\" trading environment. On Friday, a slew of cybersecurity companies tumbled after Anthropic unveiled a new capability it built into Claude Code, called Claude Code Security, that it said is capable of scanning codebases for security vulnerabilities and finding software vulnerabilities for humans to review. The sector remained under pressure in Monday's session. Monday's sell-off brought IBM shares down nearly 22% year to date.",

    "body": "In this photo illustration, a Domino's pizza sits in a take-out box on July 21, 2025 in Miami, Florida. Joe Raedle | Getty ImagesDomino's Pizza shares climbed on a Monday after the company posted a better-than-expected quarter and laid out ambitious growth plans. The strong performance came as the pizza chain said it saw higher transactions and better traction among lower-income diners with its value offerings.The pizza chain reported same-store sales growth of 3.7%, better than the 3.1% projected by Wall Street. Revenue of $1.54 billion was also higher than the $1.52 billion estimated by analysts, at a time when the broader pizza category and restaurant sector at large has faced headwinds. Domino's chief executive told CNBC in an interview Monday that the company is really just getting started, and it aims to double its market share.\"I want people to understand that I think we can double this business, and it's not a stretch, given our track record, and given how we are in other markets, to think we can get there,\" CEO Russell Weiner said.The quarterly report comes at a time when Domino's two biggest public competitors are struggling. Sales rumors are circling both Yum Brands' Pizza Hut, which has been under a recently completed strategic review, and Papa John's. While both Domino's and Papa John's stocks have fallen this year, Domino's stock has fallen about 3.6%, versus a 13.8% drop for its rival. Weiner said the success has come from offering value on Domino's core menu item. In the past, he's called this discounting on the center of the plate.\"The only disruption in the pizza category, is the disruption that we're causing, right? Is the category still growing 1 to 2 percent [and] we're up 11 share points in 11 years,\" he said. \"Two of our major competitors ... the rumor on both of those is they're off for sale. And so if that goes through, we're in a pretty unique place.\"The growth this quarter also came from traffic, or more purchases, instead of ticket, or order value — a rarity in the industry that McDonald's and Starbucks were also able to achieve. Weiner touted strength in spending among lower-income consumers, which grew in the fourth quarter and for the year.He's calling it \"profit power.\"\"We can sustain this price and make money ... why would we want to take price [and] feed less consumers, if we can maintain and grow our franchisees' profitability on this lower price and still take share,\" he said.",

The token traded as low as $64,830 early as it continued a nearly 5% slide that began a day earlier.

Stock Chart IconStock chart iconBitcoin YTDThe world's oldest cryptocurrency has taken a dive, particularly as geopolitical and macroeconomic uncertainties spark investors' flight from risk-on investments. Last week, U.S. President Donald Trump said he would decide whether to strike Iran \"over the next probably 10 days\" due to its resistance toward a new nuclear deal. The tensions seemed to build over the past few days, with the U.S. continuing to position its military forces across the Middle East. Separately, Trump said Saturday in a social media post that he would raise his so-called retaliatory tariffs against many of the U.S.' foreign trading partners to 15%, \"effective immediately,\" just one day after the Supreme Court struck down his previous trade taxes. Since the beginning of the year, Bitcoin has lost 24% due to the onslaught of macro threats, while risk-off assets like precious metals have surged.

Shannon Stapleton | ReutersA powerful blizzard ground air travel to a near halt at major airports serving New York City, Boston, Philadelphia and other areas of the eastern U.S. on Monday. Disruptions are set to last through at least Tuesday, again testing carriers on how quickly they can recover at the tail end of winter break.Much of the East Coast from Maryland to Maine was under a blizzard warning, with heavy snow already totaling nearly 2 feet in parts of New Jersey and on Long Island, New York. High wind gusts are expected to last throughout the day, the National Weather Service said. The weather service warned that travel will be treacherous, with blowing snow causing low visibility.More than 4,800 U.S. departures Monday, or close to 20% of the total scheduled U.S. departures, were canceled, as of 9:40 a.m. ET, according to aviation data firm Cirium. Daily cancellations usually run around 1% of the day's schedule. Nearly a quarter of the inbound international flights were also canceled.More than 1,000 departures and arrivals in and out of New York's LaGuardia Airport, about 98% of the day's schedule, were canceled Monday. More than 90% of the flights at Boston Logan International Airport and more than 80% of the flights at Philadelphia International Airport and Newark Liberty International Airport in New Jersey were also scrubbed.Flight disruptions were set to continue on Tuesday, with around 40% of the flights at LaGuardia and New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport canceled, with roughly the same amount canceled in Boston, according to FlightAware.Airlines routinely cancel flights ahead of major storms to avoid having aircraft and crews out of place and to make it easier to restart operations after the storm passes.A man sleeps on the ground next to his luggage in Terminal B at LaGuardia Airport in New York on February 22, 2026.

    "body": "2026 Jeep CherokeeMichael Wayland / CNBCLOS ANGELES – Stellantis is counting on the return of the Jeep Cherokee to help lead a U.S. turnaround for the SUV brand and embattled automaker. The Cherokee returns after a three-year hiatus, rejoining the compact and midsize vehicle markets, which represent the largest segments in the U.S. It also marks Jeep's first traditional hybrid model and its most fuel-efficient, gas-powered vehicle ever in the U.S.\"This is a critical vehicle for us,\" Richard Cox, Jeep senior vice president of brand operations, told CNBC during a media event for the 2026 Cherokee. \"I think this expands our reach with this level of powertrain, with this level of fuel efficiency and capability.\"The vehicle is currently arriving in U.S. dealerships as arguably the most important U.S. launch for the automaker this year. Stellantis is attempting to regain market share after significant losses in recent years. The automaker has set a target to increase retail sales by roughly 25% in 2026 to 1.15 million vehicles, driven by updated and new models as well as pricing and product realignments to move vehicles off dealer lots. \"It's a huge part of our growth,\" Cox said regarding the new Cherokee. \"It positions us well in '26.\" The interior of the 2026 Jeep Cherokee Overland.StellantisLast year, Jeep narrowly reported its first annual sales increase – up less than 1% – since 2018, when the brand achieved sales of more than 973,200 units. That compares with sales of 593,401 Jeeps in 2025, a 39% decline over the seven-year period.The 1% annual sales growth for Jeep wasn't enough to lift Stellantis' overall U.S. sales into the black for the year, though. The parent company reported a 3% decline in U.S. sales in 2025 – marking its seventh consecutive fall amid a failed push into all-electric vehicles and significant cost cutting and price increases under former CEO Carlos Tavares.Sean Hogan, a Los Angeles-area dealer who's leading Stellantis' franchised national dealer council, believes the 25% target increase in U.S. sales is achievable with the company's new leadership and product slate.\"We've been missing Cherokee. It's huge to us. It's huge to Jeep, and I think they nailed it,\" said Hogan, vice president of Sierra Auto Group. \"It's key for us to getting the machine turned back on to start the volume that's going to be flowing again and generate the capacity in our dealerships. It's bringing in new customers.\" Jeep Cherokee is priorityJeep believes it has a winner with the Cherokee, even more so than the last generation of the vehicle that peaked at nearly 240,000 units sold in 2018. The company declined to discuss production expectations, but it likely won't be able to achieve similar sales numbers until the company adds U.S. output capabilities. Plans to expand production at an Illinois plant are expected as early as next year.The Cherokee is currently only being produced at a plant in Toluca, Mexico, that also manufactures a smaller Jeep Compass SUV and Jeep Wagoneer S EV, and is slated to produce the upcoming Jeep Recon EV as soon as the second quarter.Stellantis' Toluca plant is estimated to have the capacity to produce 303,000 vehicles annually, according to AutoForecast Solutions. The auto intelligence and forecasting firm expects Jeep's U.S. sales this year to increase roughly 10% to 650,000 units, led by the Cherokee, according to Sam Fiorani, AFS vice president of global forecasting.Read moreJeep CEO Bob Broderdorf told CNBC in December that Cherokee is the priority for the brand amid slowing EV sales.\"Once Cherokee is done and has a good run rate, then we can start on Recon,\" he said. \"Recon, I'm not in a hurry. I want to get the quality right of Cherokee, and then as soon as we're confident, OK, turn on the Recon.\" Broderdorf has been leading a turnaround strategy for Jeep since being named CEO in February. Those efforts have included significantly reducing prices and model complexity and shifting away from the brand's all-electric plans as part of a broader pullback by Stellantis that will cost the company $26 billion.2026 CherokeeThe 2026 Cherokee is a traditional hybrid – a technology pioneered by the Toyota Prius – that does not require a plug, but does use a small battery and electric motors to assist fuel economy.Jeep has historically been known for its large, boxy gas-guzzling SUVs, but the Cherokee is expected to achieve 37 combined miles per gallon, including 35 mpg on the highway and 39 mpg in the city.\"Those are very competitive numbers,\" said Mike Cockell, director of Jeep Cherokee nameplate. \"It's a vehicle that must do it all for the customer, and we feel we're able to do it all. It's like a Swiss army knife.\"The updates are an attempt to make the vehicle more competitive against brands such as Toyota as well as to capitalize on expected growth in hybrid vehicles. \"Electrification trends are pretty flat. Hybrid trends are absolutely growing,\" Cox said. \"So, I think it was a big move in the right direction.\"The Cherokee features a 1.6-liter turbocharged, four-cylinder hybrid powertrain rated at 210 horsepower and 230 foot-pounds of torque. It features standard four-wheel drive, relatively large interior screens, and 140 standard and available safety and security features.Starting pricing for the Cherokee ranges from roughly $37,000 to $46,000, according to Stellantis. The bestselling model is expected to be the $39,995 Cherokee Laredo, which Stellantis says is projected to represent 36% of the vehicle's sales.The pricing positions the midsize vehicle to be competitive in its own segment as well as against compact SUVs such as the Toyota RAV4 and Honda CR-V.Jeep officials say those two brands served as benchmarks for the updated Cherokee. 'We have a number of customers that have either defected or they've moved into something else because we didn't have a product offering for them. So, this is our chance to get them back into the family, and I think do some conquesting as well,\" Cox said.",

    "body": "Aileen Cannon, judge of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida.Courtesy: US CourtsA Florida federal judge appointed by President Donald Trump blocked the public release of a final report by former special counsel Jack Smith on his prosecution of Trump for retaining classified documents after leaving the White House at his Mar-a-Lago club and for blocking efforts to retrieve them.Judge Aileen Cannon, in her order, cited her July 2024 ruling that Smith was not legally appointed as special counsel, which led to her dismissing the criminal case against Trump, as the key reason she said that Volume II of his final report on the case should not be made public. Smith had obtained a grand jury indictment of Trump on charges related to those documents in June 2023, more than two years after Trump ended his first term in the White House.Cannon also on Monday rejected a request by Trump's two co-defendants in the case to have Smith's report destroyed.In her order permanently blocking the release of that report, Cannon blasted Smith for his \"brazen stratagem\" of compiling evidence and other material obtained during his investigation and \"compiling it into a final report\" to the attorney general after she ruled his appointment as special counsel violated the appointments clause of the U.S. Constitution. Smith had taken those actions while appealing the judge's dismissal of the criminal case against Trump. The Department of Justice dropped that appeal after Trump won the 2024 presidential election.Cannon, in her ruling Monday, said releasing Smith's report \"would cause irreparable damage to former defendants from disclosure of non-public\" material that was exchanged between Smith's prosecution team and defense lawyers, which involved \"still-contested grand jury and privilege concerns.\"\"And it would contravene basic notions of fairness and justice in the process, where no adjudication of guilt has been reached following initiation of criminal charges,\" Cannon wrote in her order in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida.\"There is the matter of manifest injustice to the former defendants that would result from disclosure of Volume II,\" she wrote. \"Special Counsel Smith, acting without lawful authority, obtained an indictment in this action and initiated proceedings that resulted in a final order of dismissal of all charges. As a result, the former defendants in this case, like any other defendant in this situation, still enjoy the presumption of innocence held sacrosanct in our constitutional order.\"Former U.S. Special Counsel Jack Smith arrives for a closed-door deposition as part of a House Judiciary Committee inquiry into his now-dismissed cases against U.S. President Donald Trump over his efforts to overturn the 2020 election results and his retention of classified documents, on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C., U.S., December 17, 2025. Kevin Mohatt | ReutersTrump's co-defendants in the case, his valet Walt Nauta and Mar-a-Lago worker Carlos de Oliveira, originally asked Cannon to block the release of Smith's report. Trump in January asked Cannon to bar it from being made public.In a curious footnote in her order on Monday, Cannon referenced the fact that her ruling blocking the release of Smith reports could be appealed and that her decision could be overturned by either the 11th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals or the Supreme Court. \"As always, this Court will follow whatever mandates come from a higher court in resolving any future requests for judicial relief in this or any other case,\" Cannon wrote.Federal district court judges, as a rule, follow mandates from higher federal courts and do not typically take the time to affirm that practice in a written order.Also on Monday, Cannon denied a motion by two groups, the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University and American Oversight, to stay her ruling on releasing Smith's report pending the outcome of their appeals of her prior ruling blocking them from pursuing arguments that the report should be made public.The Knight Institute, earlier in February, asked the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals to reverse a prior order by Cannon barring the release of Smith's report. The institute is also arguing to the 11th Circuit that Cannon does not have the authority to enjoin the release of the report.\"Judge Cannon's decision to permanently block the release of this extraordinarily significant report is impossible to square with the  First Amendment and the common law,\" said Scott Wilkens, senior counsel  at the Knight Institute, in a statement on Monday. \"There is no legitimate basis for its continued  suppression.\"Lanny Breuer, an attorney for Smith, did not immediately respond to a request for comment from CNBC.Smith, during recent testimony to Congress, indicated he was barred from commenting on the contents of his report, given Cannon's prior rulings temporarily barring its disclosure.Kendra Wharton, a lawyer for Trump, in a statement said, \"Jack Smith was unconstitutionally appointed and his unlawful investigation was improperly funded with tens of millions of US taxpayers' hard earned dollars.\"\"Any and all fruit of Smith's poisonous tree should be treated accordingly and should never see the light of day,\" Wharton said.Chioma Chukwu, executive director of American Oversight, in a statement said, \"Judge Cannon's ruling continues a troubling pattern of decisions that shield the president from public scrutiny and place secrecy above the public's right to know.\"By permanently blocking the release of Volume II of the Special Counsel's report and denying our effort to seek a stay while our appeal moves forward, the court has ensured that the public is denied information of extraordinary national importance,\" Chukwu said. \"This sweeping order once again gives the president exactly what he wanted — continued concealment of the factual record underlying the historic investigation into his misconduct. American taxpayers funded this investigation, and they have a right to know what their government uncovered, particularly on matters of national security,\" Chukwu said. \"We will continue using every tool available to force this information into the open and to defend the public's right to the truth through the release of this report.\"",

    "body": "Dr. Peter Attia arrives on the red carpet for the premiere of 'Limitless with Chris Hemsworth' at Jazz at Lincoln Center in New York, New York, on Nov. 15, 2022.Gabriele Holtermann | APLongevity guru Dr. Peter Attia resigned as a contributor to CBS News amid fallout over his past email correspondence with convicted sex criminal Jeffrey Epstein being made public.\"Dr. Attia's contributor role was newly established and had not yet meaningfully begun,\" a spokesman for Attia told CNBC in a statement on Monday.\"As such, he stepped back to ensure his involvement didn't become a distraction from the important work being done at CBS,\" the spokesman said. \"He wishes the network and its leadership well and has no further comment at this time.\"The Hollywood Reporter first reported Attia's departure from CBS.CBS did not immediately respond to requests for comment by CNBC.Attia has not been accused of wrongdoing in connection with Epstein.But in early February, CBS pulled a \"60 Minutes\" segment featuring Attia from a repeat airing of that news show, days after emails between him and Epstein were released by the Department of Justice, along with millions of other documents related to criminal probes of Epstein and his accomplice, Ghislaine Maxwell.Attia's departure came to light on the same say that police in London arrested Britain's former ambassador to the United States Peter Mandelson, on suspicion of misconduct in public office. Mandelson, like the former British prince, Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, who was himself arrested on the same charge last week, has been under investigation in connection with confidential information they shared with Epstein.A number of other prominent people have left their jobs after their correspondence with Epstein was released by the DOJ. Being mentioned in the DOJ files is not proof of wrongdoing, and no one in the files has been criminally charged since they were made public.Attia was among a group of new CBS News contributors recruited by editor-in-chief Bari Weiss, who herself was hired in October, two months after the network's parent, Paramount Skydance, completed a merger between its two prior constituent parts, Paramount Global and Skydance Media.FILE PHOTO: Bari Weiss speaks at the 2022 Milken Institute Global Conference in Beverly Hills, California, U.S., May 3, 2022.  Mike Blake | ReutersIn a post on X on Feb. 3, Attia said he had told his team and patients, \"I was not involved in any criminal activity;\" \"My interactions with Epstein had nothing to do with his sexual abuse or exploitation of anyone;\" and \"I was never on his plane, never on his island, and never present at any sex parties.\"\"That said,\" Attia added, \"I apologize and regret putting myself in a position where emails, some of them embarrassing, tasteless, and indefensible, are now public, and that is on me. I accept that reality and the humiliation that comes with it.\"Attia, in his tweet, addressed a June 2015 email to Epstein with the subject line \"Got a fresh shipment,\" in which the doctor included a photograph of bottles of the medication metformin.Epstein \"replied with the words 'me too' and attached a photograph of an adult woman,\" Attia wrote. \"I responded with crude, tasteless banter.\"\"Reading that exchange now is very embarrassing, and I will not defend it. I'm ashamed of myself for everything about this. At the time, I understood this exchange as juvenile, not a reference to anything dark or harmful,\" he added.Attia also wrote that he met Epstein in 2014 \"through a prominent female health leader while I was raising funds for scientific research.\"Epstein had been released from a Florida state jail about five years earlier after serving a 13-month term for his conviction of soliciting sex from a minor.\"Between summer 2014 and spring 2019, I met with him on approximately seven or eight occasions at his New York City home, regarding research studies and to meet others he introduced me to. I never visited his island or ranch, and I never flew on any of his planes,\" Attia wrote on Twitter.\"When I was at his home, it was either meeting with him directly, meeting with small groups of scientists, doctors, or business leaders, and once at a dinner in 2015 with a number of guests including prominent heads of state.\"\"Shortly after we met, I asked him directly about his 2008 conviction. He characterized it as prostitution-related charges,\" Attia wrote. \"In 2018, I came to learn this was grossly minimized ... I was incredibly naïve to believe him. I mistook his social acceptance in the eyes of the credible people I saw him with for acceptability, and that was a serious error in my judgment. To be clear, I never witnessed illegal behavior and never saw anyone who appeared underage in his presence.Epstein killed himself in jail in New York City in August 2019, weeks after being arrested on federal child sex trafficking charges.",

    "body": "watch nowA stock market sell-off had investors rushing to the relative safety of the bond market Monday morning, causing yields to drop and mortgage rates to follow. The average rate on the popular 30-year fixed mortgage fell to 5.99% on Monday, according to Mortgage News Daily, matching its lowest levels since 2022. Last year at this time the rate was 6.89%. The drop in yields is due to a combination of factors, including new uncertainty over tariffs, cooling inflation and economic weakness shown in a lackluster gross domestic product report Friday. While rates briefly dipped into the 5% range for a few hours in January, they bounced back that same day. That is unlikely this time around, according to Matthew Graham, chief operating officer at Mortgage News Daily. \"This visit to the high 5's looks more sustainable on paper,\" Graham said. \"As long as the broader bond market doesn't sell-off in any major way, mortgage rates stand a better chance of remaining closer to present levels than they did last time. And if the broader bond market improves further (i.e. 10yr yields dipping under 4.0%), mortgage rates would likely make incremental gains.\"The drop in rates will likely incite more refinancing, which has been surging over the last several weeks. Applications to refinance a home loan are about 130% higher than they were a year ago, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association.

Buyers entering the market today will have more purchasing power than they did last spring. For example, a buyer putting 20% down on the median priced home, about $400,000 according to the National Association of Realtors, would have a monthly payment of $1,916 for the principal and interest. One year ago, that payment would have been $2,105, a difference of $189.While the difference in the monthly payment may not seem like a lot, more borrowers would qualify for a loan in general at today's lower rates. The Realtors' chief economist, Lawrence Yun, noted in his January pending home sales report that, \"With mortgage rates nearing 6%, an additional 5.5 million households that could not qualify for a mortgage one year ago would qualify at today's lower rates.\"He did make the caveat that most newly qualifying households do not act immediately, \"but based on past experience, about 10% could enter the market—potentially adding roughly 550,000 new homebuyers this year compared with last year.\"So far, applications for a mortgage to purchase a home have not seen a major reaction to lower rates. Those applications were just 8% higher year over year in mid-February. Correction: This story has been updated to correct that Monday's 30-year fixed mortgage rates matched their lowest level since 2022. A previous version misstated the milestone. ",

Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) speaks at a press conference following the Democratic weekly policy lunch on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C., Dec.9, 2025.Annabelle Gordon | ReutersA group of Senate Democrats released legislation on Monday that would mandate refunds of tariffs paid under President Donald Trump's higher duties that the Supreme Court struck down on Friday.The legislation, led by Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon, Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire and Ed Markey of Massachusetts, follows the Supreme Court's momentous 6-3 decision on Friday ruling against a majority of Trump's tariffs.\"Trump's illegal tax scheme has already done lasting damage to American families, small businesses and manufacturers who have been hammered by wave after wave of new Trump tariffs,\" Wyden, the top Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, said in a statement. \"Senate Democrats will continue fighting to rein in Donald Trump's price-hiking trade and economic policies. A crucial first step is helping people who need it most, by putting money back in the pockets of small businesses and manufacturers as soon as possible,\" he said.The White House defended the tariffs and criticized Democrats who are seeking to refund them.\"Democrats spent decades talking about lopsided 'free' trade deals, reshoring middle-class manufacturing jobs, and lowering prescription drug prices,\" White House spokesperson Kush Desai said in an emailed statement Monday. \"President Trump used tariffs to actually deliver where Democrats could only talk, so naturally Democrats are rolling up their sleeves to undermine President Trump and the American people — pathetic but unsurprising.\"The U.S. government could be on the hook for more than $175 billion in refunds to importers, according to an estimate from the Penn Wharton Budget Model, which was produced at the request of the Reuters news wire service.Read more CNBC coverage on tariffsSupreme Court strikes down Trump tariffs in rebuke of signature policyTrump announces 10% global tariff after raging over Supreme Court lossTrump tariffs: U.S. could owe $175 billion in refundsWhat the Supreme Court tariff ruling may mean for your moneySmall furniture retailers face existential tariff threat, despite Supreme Court rulingU.S. trade deficit totaled $901 billion in 2025, barely budging despite Trump’s tariffsThe majority Supreme Court opinion on Friday did not directly reference tariff refunds. Justice Brett Kavanaugh, in a dissenting opinion, quoted from oral arguments that the refund process was likely to be a \"'mess.'\"\"The United States may be required to refund billions of dollars to importers who paid the IEEPA tariffs, even though some importers may have already passed on costs to consumers or others,\" Kavanaugh wrote, referring to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, the 1977 law that the president used to impose sweeping tariffs without congressional authorization last year.Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent in an interview on Fox News on Friday said refunds would be a logistical nightmare.\"This could take years to litigate and get to a payout,\" he said. \"If there is a payout, it looks like it's just going to be the ultimate corporate welfare. What you don't know, did a Chinese supplier lower their price? Did they lower their price because of the tariff. The product came into the U.S. They paid the same price but they're going to get a refund on the tariff.\"House Democrats are also trying to compel refunds.Rep. Steven Horsford, D-Nev., on Friday introduced a bill with a similar aim in the House. Democrats are seizing on the issue — which has proven unpopular even within the ranks of the congressional GOP — ahead of a closely watched midterm election. But neither proposal has a clear path to passage with Republican majorities in both chambers and the White House's steadfast commitment to tariffs.The Senate bill would require Customs and Border Protection to pay refunds of all tariffs imposed using Trump's novel reading of IEEPA.CBP would have 180 days after enactment to process all refunds with interest and to prioritize payments to small businesses when possible. It also directs importers, wholesalers and large corporations to pass those refunds on to their customers.\"President Trump's reckless and chaotic tariffs have only caused uncertainty and pain — raising prices on consumers and businesses when they can least afford it,\" Shaheen, the top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said in a statement. \"Now that the Supreme Court has made it clear that the President did not have the authority to unilaterally impose sweeping emergency tariffs, it's critical that American families and small businesses get the relief they need.\"watch now",

    "body": "Aalyria CTO and founder Brian BarrittCourtesy AalyriaIn 2022, Google spun out a project focused on high-speed communications networks into a startup called Aalyria. Less than four years later, Aalyria is being valued by investors at $1.3 billion in a new funding round, reflecting soaring demand for reliable, speedy telecommunications. Aalyria's software helps networks deliver better service across land, at sea and in space. Its $100 million in fresh funding lands as the U.S. government bolsters its spending on defense technology and national security satellites, and as the Trump administration seeks to outpace China. SpaceX's Starlink has been snapping up government contracts, and gaining popularity with consumers, especially in areas that aren't well served by traditional high-speed internet. Rivals like Eutelsat, Amazon and others are investing heavily in their own services.Google is retaining a stake in Aalyria. Battery Ventures led the new funding round, joined by firms including J2 Ventures and DYNE.Michael Brown, a general partner at Battery, said SpaceX's success in commercializing lower earth orbit satellites with Starlink has \"stoked competitive fears of satellite vendors.\" In the early days of Russia's war on Ukraine, after SpaceX turned off Starlink over Crimea, the U.S. and European countries sought greater diversity among service providers.\"They love Starlink but want alternatives, too,\" Brown said. \"This is where Aalyria comes into play. When you have a diversity of satellite platforms, including in lower and mid-earth orbit, the ability to route traffic between them has been nearly impossible. But they provide a seamless networking layer.\"Aalyria has already locked in contracts or research funding from partners, including Telesat, the U.S. Air Force, NASA, the Defense Department's Defense Innovation Unit, the European Space Agency and other government offices.watch nowWhen a natural disaster takes out cell towers on the ground, Aalyria's Spacetime software allows a satellite communications network to move to cover the effected location within seconds rather than days, according to founder and technology chief Brian Barritt. In space, the company's software directs satellites in a constellation to automatically reconfigure to fill gaps that occur when others are degraded for any reason.Barritt said one challenge in the market is that companies building space-based networks have so much at stake, and may want to build network orchestration solutions from scratch. It takes time to gain their confidence, he said, but \"once they realize the benefit in being able to have their network operating system federate with others, orchestrate networks of networks, and monetize unused capacity, that tips the scales in our favor.\"Aalyria also sells hardware called Tightbeam, a laser-communication system, that can be affixed to a ship, a plane or other aircraft, enabling it to transmit data over distances longer than 100 kilometers, and at rates comparable to fiber internet cable.The technology behind Aalyria's Spacetime software was developed within Google and used as part of the company's Project Loon, an initiative to use high-altitude balloons to beam internet service to underserved communities. Its Tightbeam systems were also developed at Google and before that at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.Alphabet wound down Project Loon in 2021, opening up an opportunity for Aalyria's founding team to acquire and commercialize the technology. Barritt was previously a senior staff software engineer at Google, with prior experience at Cisco and NASA, while founding CEO Chris Taylor is a national security expert.Taylor brings decades of experience selling technology to the U.S. government and ally nations for civil and military purposes. He locked in the company's first outside funding from investors including Arthur Patterson, co-founder of venture firm Accel Partners.Headquartered in Livermore, California, with offices in Washington D.C., Pittsburgh and London, Aalyria now has about 90 employees, and has attracted talent from Google, Amazon, Meta and NASA. With the fresh funding, Aalyria plans to grow headcount by at least a third over the next year, Taylor said, while also investing in product, engineering and customer support.Battery's Brown said he expects the funding will enable the company to \"get their first constellations launched, operating in space, running Aalyria every minute of every day, and begin capturing additional commercial and government opportunities.\" WATCH: Why the U.S. and SpaceX need each otherwatch now",

    "body": "Former British Ambassador to the U.S. Peter Mandelson enters a vehicle outside a reported residence, after police launched a misconduct in public office investigation following the release of U.S. Justice Department files linked to the late financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, in London, Britain, Feb. 14, 2026. Chris J Ratcliffe | ReutersPolice in London on Monday arrested Peter Mandelson, Britain's former ambassador to the United States, who has been under investigation for his relationship with notorious sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.Metropolitan Police in London said that Lord Mandelson, 72, was arrested on suspicion of misconduct in public office, the same grounds on which other police in Britain last week arrested and briefly detained Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, the former prince and longtime friend of Epstein. Police did not identify Mandelson by name, as is customary in Britain, but photos of him being led from his house by police were published Monday.Police were known to be investigating whether he leaked market-sensitive information to Epstein when he was a government minister during the global financial crisis in 2009 and 2010. Mandelson, who was fired in September on orders from British Prime Minister Keir Starmer after revelations about his dealings with Epstein, has previously denied any wrongdoing. \"He was arrested at an address in Camden ... and has been taken to a London police station for interview,\" the Metropolitan Police said in a statement.\"This follows search warrants at two addresses in the Wiltshire and Camden area,\" police said. \"We are not able to provide further information at this stage to prevent prejudicing the integrity of the investigation.\"Mandelson resigned from the House of Lords in early February.In a statement then, he said, \"I want to say loudly and clearly that I was wrong to believe [Epstein] following his conviction [in 2008] and to continue my association with him afterwards.\"\"I apologize unequivocally for doing so to the women and girls who suffered,\" Mandelson said.Mandelson's arrest came four days after British police arrested Mountbatten-Windsor, brother of King Charles III, on suspicion of misconduct in public office.Mountbatten-Windsor was released later Thursday. While the nature of the investigation into him was not revealed, Thames Valley Police have said they were assessing reports that he had sent Epstein confidential trade reports in 2010, when he was Britain's special envoy for international trade.",

Jonathan Ernst | ReutersAmazon said Monday it plans to spend $12 billion on new data center campuses in Louisiana and the infrastructure to power artificial intelligence and cloud computing.The campuses will be built in the Caddo and Bossier Parishes, in northwestern Louisiana. Amazon said it expects to create 540 full-time jobs at the data centers and support about 1,700 other roles that will serve the sites, such as electricians, HVAC technicians and security specialists.Amazon announced earlier this month that it expects to invest $200 billion in capital expenditures this year, more than any of the other hyperscalers, which combined have forecast nearly $700 billion in 2026 expenditures.Wall Street has viewed Amazon's capex plans skeptically, as shares sank for nine days straight following its Feb. 5 earnings report. The slide shaved more than $450 billion off its market value.Most of Amazon's spending is expected to go to AI-related initiatives, including data centers, chips and networking equipment.Tech companies are racing to expand their data center footprints to meet the needs of companies that want to run AI models.Amazon, Microsoft and Google have all invested hundreds of billions of dollars to build mammoth data centers. Meta also picked Louisiana to be the site of its massive Hyperion data center, in a joint venture worth $27 billion with Blue Owl Capital.Read more CNBC tech newsAI robots may outnumber workers in a few decades, ex-Citi executive saysGoogle spinout Aalyria valued at $1.3 billion as investors pour into space-based communicationsSam Altman defends AI resource usage: Water concerns 'fake,' and 'humans use energy too'Microsoft Xbox chief Phil Spencer retires, replaced by AI executive Asha SharmaThe rapid buildout of AI data centers by tech companies has also been met with some pushback in local communities where the facilities are based. Residents have argued that data centers can be a drain on electricity and water resources, and negatively impact the quality of life. Microsoft last year walked away from a planned site in rural Wisconsin after residents raised environmental and financial concerns. Amazon said it worked with the local utility, Southwestern Electric Power Company, \"to ensure we pay 100% of the costs\" associated with the campus, including expenses around new and upgraded energy infrastructure.   It will also look to cool the data centers with natural air when possible in order to reduce electricity demand.The company said the Louisiana facilities will use only surplus water from the surrounding area, so there is \"no strain on local water supplies.\" Amazon plans to invest up to $400 million in public water infrastructure to support the site.Amazon said it's partnering with data center developer Stack Infrastructure on the project.

    "body": "A drone view shows the Netflix logo on one of the company's buildings in the Hollywood neighborhood in Los Angeles, California, U.S., Jan. 20, 2026.Daniel Cole | ReutersPresident Donald Trump late Saturday called on Netflix to fire board member Susan Rice or \"pay the consequences,\" after she said Democrats would push for corporate accountability if they regain power in the November midterm elections.In a Truth Social post on Saturday, Trump described Rice, who served as President Joe Biden's domestic policy chief and held top foreign policy posts under President Barack Obama, as \"purely a political hack\" with \"no talent or skills.\"\"HER POWER IS GONE, AND WILL NEVER BE BACK,\" Trump wrote. Rice argued during a podcast last week that \"it is not going to end well\" for corporations, news organizations, and law firms that \"bent the knee\" to Trump, and that their deference is unpopular.\"There is likely to be a swing in the other direction, and they are going to be caught with more than their pants down,\" Rice told Preet Bharara, a former U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York. \"They're going to be held accountable by those who come in opposition to Trump and win at the ballot box.\" She added, \"If these corporations think that Democrats, when they come back in power, are going to play by the old rules, and say, 'Never mind, we will forgive you for all the people you fired and all the policies and principles you violated, all the laws you skirted,' I think they got another thing coming.\"Rice served on Netflix's board from 2018 to 2021, and rejoined in 2023 after leaving the Biden administration. Former National Security Advisor and U.S. Ambassador to UN Susan Rice, speaks on stage at the Women In The World Summit in New York, April 11, 2019.Brendan McDermid | ReutersA Netflix spokesperson declined to comment on Trump's remarks, and the White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos told BBC, in response to a question about Trump's comments and influence on the deal, \"This is a business deal, it's not a political deal.\"\"He [Trump] likes to do a lot of things on social media,\" Sarandos said, according to the BBC.Trump's post included a screenshot of an earlier post from far-right activist and Trump ally Laura Loomer, who said Rice's remarks were \"anti-American\" and urged the president to \"kill the Netflix-Warner Bros. merger now.\" Loomer also tagged Federal Communications Commission Chairman Brendan Carr in her post.The comments come after Trump told NBC News earlier this month that the Department of Justice will \"handle\" the deal and that he'll stay out of their review, after previously saying he'd be involved in the process. The DOJ is currently reviewing Netflix's proposed acquisition of Warner Bros. Discovery.Netflix has proposed acquiring WBD in a $72 billion deal that would not include the company's cable networks, including CNN. Paramount Skydance, in response, launched a hostile takeover bid for all of WBD, promising its shareholders $30 per share in an all-cash deal. The DOJ is investigating whether Netflix's proposed deal could hurt competition, and it's also asked how the company's previous acquisitions have affected competition for creative talent, The Wall Street Journal reported earlier this month.As part of its review, the agency is also examining whether the streaming giant uses anticompetitive tactics in negotiations with independent content creators for acquiring programming, Bloomberg reported, citing documents.  Steve Sunshine, Netflix's outside counsel and the head of the global antitrust group at Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom, told CNBC in a statement that the law firm hasn't been given any notice that the DOJ is conducting a monopolization investigation. Netflix's Chief Legal Officer, David Hyman, said in a statement that the company operates in an \"extremely competitive market.\" \"Any claim that it is a monopolist, or seeking to monopolize, is unfounded,\" Hyman said. \"We neither hold monopoly power nor engage in exclusionary conduct and we'll gladly cooperate, as we always do, with regulators on any concerns they may have.\"Sarandos said last month that he's confident the company will be able to secure regulatory approval \"because this deal is pro-consumer ... pro-innovation, pro-worker.\"watch now",

Anthropic on Friday debuted a new security tool to its Claude model in a limited research preview. The AI lab said the service could scan software code for vulnerabilities and suggest solutions. Anthropic is scheduled to host an enterprise briefing with new product announcements on Tuesday.CrowdStrike and Zscaler dropped about 9% each on Monday, while Netskope declined nearly 10%. SailPoint fell 6%, and Okta, SentinelOne and Fortinet each lost more than 4%. Palo Alto Networks was last down 2%, while Cloudflare, which benefited from recent Moltbot enthusiasm, dropped 7%. The iShares Cybersecurity & Tech ETF dropped nearly 4%, and the Global X Cyberseurity ETF fell to its lowest level since November 2023.In a post to LinkedIn over the weekend, CrowdStrike CEO George Kurtz defended his company's moat in a world filled with new AI offerings.\"AI innovation is inspiring,\" he wrote. \"But let's stay grounded in reality: an AI capability that scans code does not replace the Falcon platform—or your security program.

New AI tools capable of quickly creating websites and apps through prompts and texts have rattled the software sector in recent months. Since the start of this year, software giant Salesforce has lost about one-third of its value, and ServiceNow has plummeted more than 34%. Microsoft has shed about a fifth of its value. Cybersecurity is now feeling the pinch. But some analysts challenged fears that AI may automate some common cybersecurity tasks. Bank of America said the Anthropic tool only poses a significant threat to code scanning platforms such as GitLab and JFrog, which plummeted 8% and 25%, respectively, on Friday. \"We think that AI could improve efficiency in specific workflows, particularly code scanning, but does not now have the visibility, control, or reliability to replace end-to-end security platforms,\" the analysts wrote.

    "body": "Signage outside the Chevron Corp. headquarters in Houston, Texas, US, on Wednesday, Oct. 8, 2025. Mark Felix | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesChevron on Friday reported third-quarter financial results that beat Wall Street estimates, as the company achieved record production due in part to its acquisition of Hess Corporation.The oil major's net income declined 21% to $3.54 billion, or $1.82 per share, compared with $4.49 billion, or $2.48 per share, in the same period last year. Its earnings decreased year over year due to falling oil prices and a $235 million loss on transaction costs associated with the Hess acquisition.Excluding costs associated with Hess and foreign currency impacts, Chevron earned $1.85 per share, beating Wall Street estimates of $1.68 per share.Here is what Chevron reported for the third quarter compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:Earnings per share: $1.85 adjusted vs. $1.68 expectedRevenue: $49.73 billion vs. $49.01 billion expectedU.S. crude oil prices have fallen about 16% this year as OPEC+ increases production and President Donald Trump's tariffs have the market worried about an economic slowdown.Even with lower prices, Chevron pumped a record 4.1 million barrels per day, a 21% increase compared with the same period last year. Higher production came from the Hess acquisition, the Permian Basin, the Gulf of Mexico and Kazakhstan, according to the company.Chevron's U.S. production business posted a profit of $1.28 billion, down 34% compared with $1.95 billion in the third quarter of 2024. It pumped 2 million barrels per day, up 27% from 1.6 million bpd in year-ago period.International production recorded earnings of $2 billion, down 24% compared with $2.64 billion in the same quarter last year. Production increased 16% to 2 million bpd compared with 1.76 million bpd in the year-ago period.Profits increased more than 300% to $638 million in Chevron's downstream U.S. refining business, compared with $146 million in the third quarter of 2024. International refining posted earnings of $499 million, up 11% from $449 million in the year-ago period. Refining profits increased year over year due to higher margins on product sales.Capital expenditures increased 7% to $4.4 billion over the year-ago quarter due to spending on legacy Hess assets. Chevron's adjusted free cash flow increased about 50% to $7 billion over the year-ago period.Update: Chevron reported earnings of $1.85 per share compared to $1.68 expected by an LSEG survey of Wall Street analysts. This story has been changed to reflect updated earnings per share expectations. ",

    "body": "Mateusz Slodkowski | SOPA Images | Lightrocket | Getty ImagesNetflix announced a 10-for-1 stock split Thursday, a move that changes nothing fundamentally about the company, but could make the pricey individual shares more accessible to the retail investor.Existing shareholders as of Nov. 10 will receive nine additional shares for each one they hold. They'll get that allotment on Nov. 14, and the stock will begin trading at the new post-split price on Monday, Nov. 17.Netflix, the streaming leader whose shares have boomed over the last three years to above $1,000 apiece, said it was making the change to \"reset the market price of the Company's common stock to a range that will be more accessible to employees who participate in the Company's stock option program.\"Netflix shares added more than 2% after hours on the split announcement. The stock closed Thursday at $1,089 a share, up 42% for the year.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconNetflix, 5 yearsThe stock is currently one of 10 stocks in the S&P 500 with a price above $1,000.It's common practice for companies that reach those levels to split the shares, although the effectiveness of such a move is debatable with the widespread use of fractional trading available on brokerage platforms.A split simply gives each a holder more shares at a lower price, while the value of their holding does not change at all. All fundamental measures for the company remain the same.Warren Buffett has famously refused to split the shares of Berkshire Hathaway for this reason, with the stock priced at more than $717,000 a share. Buffett did create a \"B\" class of shares that are more modestly priced at $478 each.Netflix has split its shares twice before, in 2015 and 2004.",

Here is what Exxon reported for the third quarter compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:Earnings per share: $1.88 adjusted.Revenue: $85.3 billion, vs. $87.7 billion expectedCEO Darren Woods said Exxon posted its highest earnings per share compared to similar quarters when oil prices were falling. Profits also took a hit due to bottom-of-cycle margins in its chemicals business. However, production in Exxon's lucrative offshore assets in the South American nation of Guyana hit a quarterly record of more than 700,000 barrels per day. Its assets in the Permian Basin also set a production record of nearly 1.7 million bpd. Overall, Exxon produced 4.77 million bpd in the quarter. Exxon's production business recorded earnings of $5.68 billion, while its refining business posted a profit of $1.8 billion. Its chemicals product business saw earnings of $515 million. The oil major's capital expenditures stand at about $21 billion so far this year. It expects spending in 2025 to come in slightly below the lower end of its guidance range of $27 billion to $29 billion.Exxon gave back $9.4 billion to shareholders in the quarter and raised its fourth-quarter dividend to $1.03 per share.

    "body": "Jerome Powell, chairman of the US Federal Reserve, during a news conference following a Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting in Washington, DC, US, on Wednesday, Oct. 29, 2025. Al Drago | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesFederal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell faces if not the most difficult challenge of his time in office at least the trickiest in his final months as head of the all-powerful U.S. central bank.Fresh off his surprisingly tough talk Wednesday on the potential for another interest rate cut in December, Powell will have to steer his way through a suddenly contentious atmosphere among policymakers that will make whichever direction the Fed chooses divisive.While it's not the existential economic threat posed by the Covid pandemic in 2020, it nevertheless indicates a level of peril uncommon for the institution.\"December could get messy,\" Bank of America economist Aditya Bhave said in a client note. \"We still think the Fed won't cut rates again under Chair Powell. But barring a clear signal in either direction from the data, the December decision will likely be even more contentious than October.\"The Fed on Wednesday approved a widely anticipated quarter percentage point rate reduction that took its benchmark rate down to 3.75%-4%. However, Powell warned that another cut in December \"is not a foregone conclusion,\" something the market was not expecting.While Wall Street economists and strategists were split over whether the committee will in fact approve another reduction at the Dec. 9-10 meeting, they were in agreement that this is a pivotal moment for Powell and the legacy he ultimately will leave when his term runs out in May.\"Even in a situation without much additional data due to the shutdown, it can actually make sense to push against market pricing to keep optionality going forward,\" wrote Michael Gapen, chief U.S. economist at Morgan Stanley. \"A 95% probability assigned to a December cut does not seem consistent with a data-dependent Fed.\"Markets reactFor their part, traders weren't buying the hawkish rhetoric. Fed fund futures pricing Thursday still indicated a 75% probability of a cut in December, though that was down from around 90% the day before, according to the CME Group's FedWatch.But Powell went to great lengths in his post-meeting news conference Wednesday to dispel the notion that the reduction, which would be the third since September, is a slam dunk.The thrust of his argument was multi-pronged: What data there is available during the government shutdown blackout has largely showed a stable economy though the labor market is a risk; inflation is still above target; and, in an unusual development, there are \"strongly differing\" views on the FOMC for where policy should move.Markets were clearly caught off guard by the move, with stocks slipping and Treasury yields surging. The 10-year Treasury yield was solidly above 4% Thursday while the policy-sensitive 2-year note climbed over 3.6% to its highest level in about a month.\"The reaction of the bond market should certainly give Fed officials pause,\" wrote Ed Yardeni, head of Yardeni Research and coiner of the term \"bond vigilantes\" to describe buyers' strikes in the fixed income markets. \"The bond market isn't buying the Fed's cover story that interest rates were too restrictive.\"For Powell, the statement regarding December was an unusual step considering markets had been expecting a more neutral tone. Asked whether he was bothered by the strong anticipation of another cut, Powell said markets should take his statement that a reduction \"is not a foregone conclusion\" should be \"taken on board.\"\"You've got get right in front of that, because you don't want to surprise the market a couple weeks down the road. Now is the time to do it,\" said Dan North, senior economist for North America at Allianz Trade. \"He doesn't usually use words quite so forcefully. So that was interesting, and he's clearly trying to squash speculation about December. We feel the same way, December is going to be a pause.\"Political overhangThe developments come at a ticklish time for the Fed.Powell, a favorite target for President Donald Trump's criticism, has only seven months or so left in his term. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has been busy interviewing potential successors — among them current Governors Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman, both of whom voted in favor of the cut.In addition, Governor Stephen Miran, a hand-picked Trump appointee who will only serve through January, again dissented from the vote in favor of a half-point.At the other end of the spectrum, Kansas City Fed President Jeffrey Schmid voted \"no\" as well, but because he wanted to not cut. Between them run a range of views on the normally consensus-driven FOMC.Whether Powell's tip of the hat to the doves reflects merely a courtesy or deeper misgivings about cuts will be central to Fed analysis in the coming weeks.\"While the press conference played out somewhat differently than we expected, we have not changed our Fed forecast and continue to see a December cut as quite likely,\" Goldman Sachs economist David Mericle wrote. \"We suspect that there is substantial opposition on the FOMC to the risk management cuts and that Powell thought it was important to voice other participants' concerns today in his press conference. But we still think that the arguments for a December cut remain intact.\"",

    "body": "Drone view of damage to coastal homes after Hurricane Melissa made landfall, in Alligator Pond, Jamaica, Oct. 29, 2025. Maria Alejandra Cardona | ReutersHurricane Melissa, the most powerful Atlantic hurricane of the year, made landfall this week as a Category 5 storm in Jamaica. The strength of the storm means it will likely trigger a full payout from a catastrophe bond designed to provide funds to the island in the event of catastrophic weather events.The $150 million catastrophe bond, structured by Aon, is intended to help the island's people rebuild after natural disasters by providing Jamaica parametric coverage against losses from named storms. The policy took effect this year and lasts through 2027.The government of Jamaica is the first government in the Caribbean region, and the first of any small island state, to independently sponsor a cat bond, according to Aon. Its likely payout demonstrates the value of a unique type of backstop funded by the private markets.In order to trigger the full payment, the storm has to meet a particular strength criteria. The central pressure of the storm must be at or below 900 millibars as its makes landfall and crosses the island nation.A drone view shows an affected area after Hurricane Melissa made landfall, in Crane Road, Black River, Jamaica, October 30, 2025. Maria Alejandra Cardona | ReutersEarly data from the National Hurricane Center shows Hurricane Melissa's pressure stayed below 900 millibars in several areas. Those readings are in the process of being verified by an independent calculation agent.\"While the final numbers are still being verified, the early signs suggest the transaction is doing what it was designed to do: getting critical funds to the country quickly after a major disaster,\" Chris Lefferdink, Aon's head of insurance-linked securities for North America, said in a statement.  The review process typically takes 2 to 3 weeks, and the earliest possible payout to Jamaica could come in approximately 1 month, according to a spokesperson from Aon.Previous parametric transactions payouts have taken 3 months or more, but for this event Aon used an innovative data source to enable faster payments.The catastrophe bond was placed using the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development's \"capital at risk\" program, which is used to transfer the risks associated with natural catastrophes to the capital markets, allowing the country to access funds quickly after a major event.Damaged furniture and debris after Hurricane Melissa made landfall, in Black River, Jamaica, Oct. 30, 2025. Octavio Jones | Reuters\"What you have is a capital provider putting funds in the pool, an insurer putting the coupon for those funds in the pool [and] if the storm hits that criteria, they get the money in a much quicker fashion,\" Aon CFO Edmund Reese told CNBC's Contessa Brewer in an interview.Catastrophe bond and insurance-linked securities were created in the mid 1990s in the wake of Hurricane Andrew's destruction. They've since grown in popularity, with the cat bond market growing by over 50% since the end of 2022 to nearly $55 billion.\"Public-private partnerships like Jamaica's continue to highlight how parametric insurance can deliver rapid, transparent relief in the wake of severe storms,\" Lefferdink said.Jamaica very narrowly missed the requirements necessary to receive a payout from a separate cat bond when Hurricane Beryl battered the island in 2024, resulting in $995 million in damages to homes, crops and infrastructure, according to the National Hurricane Center.",

    "body": "Photo illustration of the YouTube TV logo displayed on a smartphone, with the YouTube logo in the background.Nurphoto | Nurphoto | Getty ImagesDisney content, including channels like ABC and ESPN, was removed from Google's YouTube TV overnight after the two companies failed to renew a streaming contract. \"Despite our best efforts, we have not been able to reach a fair deal, and starting today, Disney programming will not be available on YouTube TV,\" the platform said in a statement.More than 20 channels would be removed from YouTube TV, the company said, adding if the content is unavailable for an extended period of time, the company would offer users a $20 credit. Disney said in a statement, \"Google's YouTube TV has chosen to deny their subscribers the content they value most by refusing to pay fair rates for our channels, including ESPN and ABC.\"\"With a $3 trillion market cap, Google is using its market dominance to eliminate competition and undercut the industry-standard terms we've successfully negotiated with every other distributor. We know how frustrating this is for YouTube TV subscribers and remain committed to working toward a resolution as quickly as possible,\" Disney said.The two sides had been engaged in negotiations but were unable to reach a new distribution agreement before their existing contract expired Oct. 30 at 11:59 p.m. ET.Disney warned last week it could result in a content blackout.In a Thursday statement on its official blog, YouTube argued Disney had \"used the threat of a blackout on YouTube TV as a negotiating tactic to force deal terms that would raise prices on our customers,\" and that Disney was now following through on that threat.\"We will not agree to terms that disadvantage our members while benefiting Disney's own live TV products,\" YouTube TV said in a post on its help center webpage. Disney's live TV offerings include Hulu + Live TV and Fubo.\"We know how disruptive it is to lose channels you enjoy, and we're committed to continuing to work with Disney to reach an agreement,\" YouTube said in its statement.YouTube TV pays broadcasters to stream their channels and has been engaged in several tense negotiations over contract renewals in recent months.Last month, NBCUniversal content was nearly removed from YouTube TV before the companies reached an agreement after a temporary extension, preventing shows like \"Sunday Night Football\" and \"America's Got Talent\" from being pulled.CNBC reported last week that Disney was willing to offer YouTube TV a distribution agreement that would give some subscribers access to Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+ for no extra charge. Disney has previously offered similar terms to Charter, the largest U.S. pay TV provider by subscribers.However, YouTube asked for Disney's streaming content to be ingested into YouTube TV, giving customers the ability to view programming on Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+ without leaving the platform, according to a source familiar with the negotiations.Disney had rejected that proposal and had no plans to budge on the request, people familiar with the company's thinking told CNBC.The recent clash between Disney and YouTube has an added twist, after YouTube hired former Disney distribution executive Justin Connolly earlier this year, prompting Disney to file a breach-of-contract lawsuit.Connolly has recused himself from the discussions, CNBC previously reported, according to the people familiar with the process. Disney and YouTube reportedly settled the lawsuit.YouTube is the top U.S. media distributor by audience engagement, capturing over 13% of TV watch-time in July, according to Nielsen. It is also on track to be the biggest media company by revenue in 2025, beating Disney, analysts at MoffettNathanson told CNBC.— CNBC's Alex Sherman contributed to this report.Disclosure: Comcast is the parent company of NBCUniversal, which owns CNBC. Versant would become the new parent company of CNBC upon Comcast's planned spinoff of Versant.Clarification: This article has been updated to clarify that NBCUniversal content was nearly removed from YouTube TV last month before those companies reached an agreement.",

Nurphoto | Nurphoto | Getty ImagesGoogle will offer its Gemini AI service for free to over 500 million Reliance Jio users in India, as global artificial intelligence firms double down on acquiring customers in the country.The U.S. tech giant revealed Thursday that it had signed a pact with Reliance Intelligence, a joint venture between Reliance Industries and Meta, to provide Google's AI Pro plan, which includes Gemini 2.5 Pro, expanded access to NotebookLM for study and research, and 2 TB of cloud storage, among other things.Mukesh Ambani, chairman of Reliance Industries, said his firm aims to make India \"AI-empowered\" through collaborations with strategic and long-term partners such as Google. Reliance Jio is India's largest telecom services operator.Google services, worth 35,100 rupees per user ($396), will have a staggered roll out with early access for 18- to 25-year-old users on unlimited Jio 5G plans for for 18 months. Eventually they will be made available for free to the company's entire customer base.\"I'm excited for how this partnership will help expand access to AI across India,\" said Sundar Pichai, chief executive officer of Google and Alphabet.There are about 377 million Gen Zs in India, driving $860 billion in consumer spending in the country, and that is set to rise to $2 trillion by 2035, according to a report by the Boston Consulting Group.India has the highest number of users globally across social media platforms such as Facebook (350 million-plus), Instagram (413.8 million), video app YouTube (over 467 million) while messaging app WhatsApp has over 500 million users, making it a key market for digital services. In July, the second largest Indian telecom operator Bharti Airtel partnered with Perplexity to offer its 360 million customers free access to Perplexity Pro, which is priced at $200 per year globally.Airtel and Perplexity followed this up with intensive campaigns on social media platforms, enlisting leading Indian influencers who posted reels promoting the use-cases for the free AI tool.Indian telecom market is dominated by Jio and Airtel and partnerships with these telecom operators offer the opportunity for companies to expand the reach of apps and digital tools, making them available to a mass audience.On Tuesday, OpenAI reportedly said it would make its ChatGPT Go plan free for users in India for a year, starting Nov. 4. The offer was launched in August for 399 rupees per month, and was among the most affordable subscription plans from OpenAI.The company is rapidly expanding its presence in India, its second largest market, and plans to set up a 1 gigawatt data center in the country.",

    "body": "A customer shops for Halloween candy at a Walmart Supercenter on October 16, 2024 in Austin, Texas. Brandon Bell | Getty ImagesThe scariest thing haunting Halloween this year isn't a ghost, goblin or ghoul — it's the price of chocolate.From Snickers to Reese's to Twix, one of America's favorite indulgences is getting more expensive, as tariffs, inflation and high cocoa prices squeeze profit margins and customers' pocketbooks, possibly leading to fewer chocolate bars landing in trick-or-treat buckets this year.Chocolate prices have surged nearly 30% since last Halloween and almost 78% in the past five years, according to data from research firm Circana and the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. A 100-piece variety bag of candy now costs $16.39, up from $7.20 in 2020, FinanceBuzz found.That spike is showing up on store shelves. Variety packs from Hershey — maker of Reese's, KitKats and Heath bars — are up about 22%, while Mars, the company behind M&M's and Milky Way, raised prices about 12%, according to the Century Foundation, a progressive, independent think tank, and the Groundwork Collaborative.\"The season did get off to a slow start,\" Hershey CEO Kirk Tanner told investors on an earnings call Thursday, warning that holiday sales could be softer this year.About 4 in 5 Americans buy candy for the Halloween holiday, according to YouGov. This time of year makes up about 18% of annual U.S. confectionery sales — second only to Christmas, according to the National Confectioners Association.But chocolate's dominance is slipping. Circana found it made up 52% of Halloween candy sales last year, compared with 44% this year, as shoppers shift toward cheaper, trendier sweets.\"Macroeconomic headwinds\" are among the culprits, said Sally Wyatt, who works for Circana analyzing global consumer packaged goods and as a food-service industry advisor. \"It's the compounded impact on top of the fact that we've outpaced wage growth. So consumers have started to ... [make] very specific choices on discretionary items.\"Sector-wide, candy prices are outpacing the national inflation rate, marking a roughly 10% increase compared with last year, according to the Century Foundation. Still, the National Retail Federation said 2025 is expected to be a record year for candy sales in the U.S., with about $3.9 billion spent on Halloween candy alone.\"Even as consumers face higher prices for food, they continue to leave room in their budgets for chocolate and candy, meaning that the category is strong, vibrant and growing,\" Carly Schildhaus, a spokesperson for the National Confectioners Association, told CNBC.Much of the chocolate filling U.S. shelves this fall was made from cocoa beans purchased at record prices last December, when futures peaked above $12,000 per ton, experts said. Prices have since cooled to around $6,000, but that's still more than double the pre-pandemic average.A cocktail of rising temperatures, erratic rainfall, drought and crop disease for the past three years has devastated harvests in West Africa, which produces roughly 70% of the world's cocoa. The result: the largest global cocoa deficit in 60 years, with supply falling half a million tons short of demand.Prices could stabilize, but not decrease, by next year as crop yields have increased, said David Branch, a sector manager at Wells Fargo Agri-Food Institute.\"It's not just the cost of manufacturing cocoa and other ingredients,\" Branch told CNBC. \"It's also a combination of labor, transportation, fuel, overhead [and] all of those factors, and, given the inflationary rate we've been in, those came up and haven't really come down.\"Hershey said Thursday that tariff expenses will cost the company $160 million to $170 million this year. In July, it also announced a \"low double-digit\" price hike, though executives said those increases weren't tied to tariffs or Halloween pricing.Chocolate makers have lobbied the Trump administration for tariff exemptions on cocoa and other agricultural imports, arguing they have little ability to source those ingredients domestically.Sweet varietyAs chocolate becomes more expensive, fruity, sour and chewy candies have gotten more popular. More than half of shoppers said they planned to prioritize gummy candies for Halloween this year, NielsenIQ found.On average, the price per pound of chocolate rose nearly 14% in the 12 weeks ending Oct. 5, while sales volumes fell 6%, Circana data show. Non-chocolate Halloween candy such as Jolly Ranchers and Skittles saw sales climb 8.3% in that same period.Younger adults, especially Gen Z, are also fueling growth in non-chocolate categories — gravitating toward gummies, freeze-dried sweets and TikTok-friendly flavor mashups.\"It's that experiential [aspect] because you can have it [non-chocolate items] with chewy, with sweet flavors, with hot and sweet, spicy flavors,\" Wyatt told CNBC. \"Some candies you get this big explosion in your mouth of flavors. We've seen it popular with different cohorts.\"Chocolate makers are responding in kind. Hershey has expanded its gummy lineup, including a partnership with Shaquille O'Neal, and rolled out ghost-shaped Twizzlers and mismatched \"Trickies\" Jolly Rancher gummies.Mondelez International, maker of Cadbury and Toblerone, said it's also prioritizing gummies in the U.S. market. CEO Dirk Van de Put said on an earnings call Tuesday, however, that the U.S. market in particular \"is slower than we've seen in quite a while\" and the company's promotional strategy earlier this year \"was not giving us the volume effect that we were hoping for.\"Manufacturers are also experimenting with smaller bars, new fillings and cocoa-free options such as crème or nut-based confections to offset rising ingredient costs, Branch said.\"Companies have got to be very aware of if they can keep their prices in line. They can't just keep increasing their prices and expect sales to continue to go up,\" Branch said. \"But customers have not lost their appetite for chocolate. It's going to remain an indulgence that people will always have and can't really do without.\"",

    "body": "An aerial view of homes in a neighborhood on Aug.27, 2025 in San Francisco, California.Justin Sullivan | Getty ImagesWhile the Federal Reserve cut its benchmark interest rate this week, mortgage rates responded by doing just the opposite.The average rate on the 30-year fixed mortgage has jumped 20 basis points since Chairman Jerome Powell announced the cut on Wednesday and held a news conference, according to Mortgage News Daily.This happened the last time the Fed lowered its rate as well, and the reason is pretty simple: the bond market had already priced in a cut, but it didn't like the commentary from Powell.On Tuesday, the average rate on the 30-year fixed had fallen to 6.13%, matching the recent low on Sept. 16, which was the day before the Fed announced its last cut, and marking the lowest level in a year.Then this week, after the Fed said it would reduce rates and Powell answered questions in a news conference, that rate shot up 14 basis points on Wednesday and rose another 6 basis points on Thursday, to 6.33%, an even 20 basis points higher than where it was Tuesday. The last time around in September, the rate on the 30-year fixed mortgage went even higher, to 6.37%.Get Property Play directly to your inboxCNBC's Property Play with Diana Olick covers new and evolving opportunities for the real estate investor, delivered weekly to your inbox.Subscribe here to get access today.\"The market's enthusiasm for 3 Fed rate cuts in 2025 had grown a bit too large for the Fed's liking,\" said Matthew Graham, chief operating officer at Mortgage News Daily, in a client note. \"The market was nearly 100% certain of another cut in December. The Fed was not as certain, and Powell made it a point to say so yesterday. The result is a mild re-set in yields back to levels that are more consistent with a December cut being a solid possibility, but not a full lock.\" The recent drop in rates had caused a run on refinances, with those applications up 111% last week year over year, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association. Lower rates did not, however, move the needle much for potential homebuyers.",

    "body": "Chinese-made automobiles and construction machinery are assembled and shipped for export at Yantai Port in Yantai City, Shandong Province, China, on October 21, 2025.  Costfoto | Nurphoto | Getty ImagesChina's manufacturing activity in October contracted more than expected, shrinking to the lowest level in six months, an official survey showed on Friday, as trade tensions with Washington reignited during the month.The official manufacturing purchasing managers' index came in at 49.0, data from the National Bureau of Statistics showed, missing economists' expectations for 49.6 in a Reuters poll. A reading above the 50 benchmark indicates growth while one below that suggests contraction. The latest reading reversed the recovery in recent months, after the PMI rose to a six-month high of 49.8 in September, compared to 49.4 in August and 49.3 in July.The sub-indexes tracking production, new orders, raw material inventory and employment all sunk further into contraction, official data showed, pointing to a deeper manufacturing slowdown and softer demand.The non-manufacturing PMI, covering construction and services, ticked up to 50.1, boosted by the renewed momentum in air and railway transportation, accommodation, cultural and sports-related entertainment activities. October saw an eight-day Golden Week holiday that ran from Oct. 1 to 8.The NBS composite manufacturing and non-manufacturing PMI dipped to 50, its lowest level since December 2022, according to Wind Information.Huo Lihui, NBS chief statistician, attributed the slowdown to the weeklong holiday that shuttered most factories in China, and an \"increasingly complex international environment.\" The country's manufacturing activity has remained in contraction since April, when U.S. President Donald Trump's started his tariff campaign, pressuring Chinese factories.China's economy expanded 4.8% in the third quarter, marking the slowest growth in a year. Adding to the constraint on the economy, fixed-asset investment unexpectedly contracted 0.5% in the first nine months of the year — the first such decline since pandemic-hit 2020 — according to data going back to 1992 from Wind Information.Large industrial firms saw their profits surge the most in nearly two years, rising 21.6% in October from the same period a year earlier, as declines in factory-gate prices eased amid Beijing's campaign to rein in a bruising price war and excess capacity.Domestic demand has remained sluggish, with a protracted property slump and soft labor-market conditions eroding households' spending power.China and the U.S. reached a trade truce on Thursday after months of rising tensions, de-escalating the situation that had threatened to push the world's two largest economies into a full-blown trade war.Trump said the U.S. would immediately cut the 20% fentanyl-linked tariffs on Chinese goods by half, and in turn, Beijing would resume \"massive\" purchases of American soybeans and other farm products. China also agreed to pause its sweeping rare-earth controls for a year while taking steps to stem the flow of precursor chemicals used in fentanyl production. Both sides agreed to suspend fees for one year on ships that dock at each other's ports.But analysts cautioned that the meeting fell short of a comprehensive pact that addressed matters core to the U.S.-China rivalry and other contentious issues, including Taiwan, making the deal vulnerable to another escalation in the delicate detente.\"As the trade negotiation went successfully yesterday, the macro policy in China will likely stay unchanged for the rest of this year,\" said Zhiwei Zhang, president and chief economist at Pinpoint Asset Management, expecting more proactive fiscal policy early next year.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tWeekly analysis and insights from Asia's largest economy in your inbox\n\t\t\tSubscribe now\n\t\t\n\t",

Kent Nishimura | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesKorean semiconductor giant Samsung said Thursday that it plans to buy and deploy a cluster of 50,000 Nvidia graphics processing units to improve its chip manufacturing for mobile devices and robots.The 50,000 Nvidia GPUs will be used to create a facility Samsung is calling an \"AI Megafactory.\" Samsung didn't provide details about when the facility would be built.It's the latest splashy partnership for Nvidia, whose chips remain essential for building and deploying advanced artificial intelligence.The agreement with Samsung comes after Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang on Tuesday announced in Washington, D.C., that Nvidia was collaborating with companies including Palantir, Eli Lilly, CrowdStrike and Uber.Shortly after the speech, Huang was spotted in South Korea drinking beer with Samsung Chairman Lee Jae-yong and other business leaders, according to local media. Other Korean companies, including SK Group and Hyundai, are also deploying similar amounts of GPUs, Nvidia said.\"We're working closely with the Korean government to support its ambitious leadership plans in AI,\" Raymond Teh, Nvidia's senior vice president of Asia-Pacific, said on a call Wednesday with reporters.The partnerships support Huang's claim on Tuesday that Nvidia has a book of business that totals $500 billion from its current generation GPU, called Blackwell, in addition to its next-generation GPU, called Rubin.The forecast helped boost Nvidia's stock, making the company the first to reach a market cap of $5 trillion.On Thursday, Nvidia representatives said they will work with Samsung to adapt the Korean company's chipmaking lithography platform to work with Nvidia's GPUs. That process will results in 20 times better performance for Samsung, the Nvidia representatives said. Samsung will also use Nvidia's simulation software called Omniverse. Known for its mobile phones, Samsung also said it would use the Nvidia chips to run its own AI models for its devices.In addition to being a partner and customer, Samsung is also a key supplier for Nvidia.Samsung makes the kind of high-performance memory Nvidia uses in large quantities, alongside its AI chips, called high bandwidth memory. Samsung said it will work with Nvidia to tweak its fourth-generation HBM memory for use in AI chips.WATCH: Night out in Seoul: Nvidia, Samsung, and Hyundai bosses bond over fried chicken and sojuwatch now",

Analysts polled by StreetAccount had expected $32.42 billion, or growth of 18.1% from a year earlier. Operating income rose 9% from a year ago to $11.4 billion, also beating estimates and accounting for about two-thirds of Amazon's total operating profit. AWS is the world's top provider of cloud infrastructure, but it's facing intensifying pressure from competitors Google and Microsoft, which also reported quarterly results this week.Google's cloud revenue increased 34% during the third quarter, while Microsoft Azure recorded growth of 40%.Amazon's earnings report comes a little over a week after AWS experienced an extended outage that lasted more than 15 hours, taking down numerous websites. Microsoft was hit with outages in its Azure cloud and 365 services on Wednesday, hours before its scheduled earnings release.Amazon officially opened its $11 billion AI data center called Project Rainier on Wednesday. The facility, first announced last year, is intended to train and run models from Claude creator Anthropic. Amazon, which has invested $8 billion in Anthropic, said the startup will use 1 million of its custom Trainium2 chips by the end of 2025.The new data center could help Amazon battle the perception that it's missing out on a flurry of highly lucrative artificial intelligence deals for cloud services.

    "body": "NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang speaks during the Live Keynote Pregame during the Nvidia GTC (GPU Technology Conference) in Washington, DC, on Oct. 28, 2025.Jim Watson | AFP | Getty ImagesNvidia CEO Jensen Huang said on Friday that artificial intelligence had reached a \"virtuous cycle,\" tipping the industry for continuous growth.Speaking at the APEC CEO Summit in South Korea, Huang said the vast improvements in AI models were leading to more investment in the technology, which was, in turn, improving the AI models even further.\"We have now achieved what is called the virtual cycle,\" he said on stage at the event, wearing a suit rather than his usual black leather jacket.\"The AIs get better. More people use it. More people use it, it makes more profit, creates more factories, which allows us to create even better AIs, which allows more people to use it. The virtual cycle of AI has been designed, and this is ... the reason why you're seeing the world's capex going so fast.\"His comments come as Big Tech is spending billions to build out AI-related infrastructure and serve its end users.This year was expected to be a big one for AI spend with Meta, Amazon, Alphabet and Microsoft announcing plans to spend over $300 billion combined on AI technologies and datacenter buildouts. This looks set to continue into 2026 as the tech giants plan to boost spending again, per their respective earnings, reported this week.Dan Ives, Wedbush Securities global head of technology research, described Nvidia as \"the foundation of the AI Revolution\" in comments to CNBC after Huang's comments on stage.He described the AI virtuous cycle as: \"The more demand, the more building of AI building blocks. And demand creates more demand and capex.\"watch nowHuang stressed that profitability was at the heart of the current boom in AI capital investment.\"When something becomes profitable, you want to manufacture more of it, just like when you're manufacturing chips and wafers and DRAM, if the manufacturing of those chips were profitable, you want to build more factories to create more chips,\" he added.A new era of computingIt is the beginning of a new era of computing, as, with AI, \"every single layer of the computing stack is being fundamentally changed,\" Huang said on stage.We are at the beginning of a 10-year build-out of this new era, he added.\"AI runs on GPUs [graphics processing unit], whereas hand-coded software runs on CPUs [central processing unit]. This entire software stack, from the ... the needs of energy, chips, the infrastructure, all of the software associated with the systems, the AI models and the applications on top, every single layer of computing has been fundamentally changed,\" he said.\"Just think: the computer industry has been largely the same for 60 years, and now, with AI and accelerated computing, every single layer of the computing stack is being changed. All of the computers we've created in the past, a trillion dollars, maybe more, of computers needs to now be transitioned, shifted to the new computing platform,\" he added.Nvidia, which became the first company to surpass $5 trillion in market value earlier this week, announced a partnership with Korean semiconductor giant Samsung earlier on Friday. Samsung plans to buy and deploy a cluster of 50,000 Nvidia GPUs to improve its chip manufacturing for mobile devices and robots.Huang painted a picture of the future in which AI is able to \"work,\" rather than just be used as a tool. Highlighting the rise of fully automated manufacturing factories, the CEO expects AI to reshape $100 trillion worth of industries around the world.— CNBC's Kif Leswing contributed to this report.",

    "body": "A Chipotle logo is displayed on a sign at a shop on June 1, 2025 in Washington, DC.Kevin Carter | Getty ImagesShares of Chipotle Mexican Grill tumbled as much as 19% in trading Thursday after the company cut its full-year same-store sales forecast for the third straight quarter.Including Thursday's move, the stock has fallen 45% this year, dragging its market value down to roughly $43 billion. At least five Wall Street analysts have cut their price targets for the stock after the report, anticipating investors' displeasure with the burrito chain's shrinking traffic and gloomy outlook.\"It's difficult to call a bottom for sales given the multitude of factors weighing on demand,\" Citi analyst Jon Tower wrote in a research note, revising his price target from $54 to $44 per share.In the third quarter, Chipotle's same-store sales rose 0.3%, but the chain's traffic fell. While many restaurant chains have suffered in recent years as diners wracked by inflation eat out less, analysts were unsure if the chain's value perception contributed to Chipotle's issues. While its burritos and bowls average about $10, consumers often assume its average prices are closer to the $15 entrees of its fast-casual peers, executives said on the conference call.\"While we knew that traffic had slowed for Chipotle into the fall, we were surprised by the magnitude that was reported last night and the resulting deleverage this produced,\" BTIG analyst Pete Saleh wrote in a note. \"We're admittedly perplexed by how suddenly this traffic weakness came about, and not convinced affordability concerns are the main driver here.\"watch nowCEO Scott Boatwright said on Wednesday's earnings conference call that diners are visiting less frequently, particularly those between the ages of 25 and 35 years old, a key demographic for the company. Same-store sales have worsened so far in October, and the company is now projecting that sales at restaurants open at least a year will shrink in the fourth quarter and fall by a low-single digit percentage for the full year.\"We are very concerned that the menu and marketing actions taken so far have not sufficiently offset the traffic retraction,\" Bernstein analyst Danilo Gargiulo said.Still, most analysts attributed the slowdown to industrywide challenges, not company-specific issues that Chipotle needs to address. Unemployment, increased student loan repayments and slower real wage growth accounting for inflation are weighing on consumers' spending, according to Boatwright.\"We believe the brand remains fundamentally healthy (stable share of customer restaurant wallet) and expect a return to growth as the macro improves,\" Bank of America Securities analyst Sara Senatore wrote in a note to clients.Chipotle's weak performance bodes poorly for its fast-casual peers, like Sweetgreen and Cava. Morgan Stanley analyst Brian Harbour called fast-casual restaurants \"This Season's Halloween Scare\" in his research note covering Chipotle's earnings report.Shares of Sweetgreen fell 6% in trading Thursday, while Cava stock was down 8%. Both are slated to report their third-quarter results next week.Correction: The company is now projecting that sales at restaurants open at least a year will fall by a low-single digit percentage for the full year. An earlier version misstated the percentage move.",

    "body": "Reddit CEO Steve Huffman stands on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) after ringing a bell on the floor setting the share price at $47 in its initial public offering (IPO) on March 21, 2024 in New York City.Spencer Platt | Getty ImagesReddit reported third-quarter earnings on Thursday in which the company beat on the top and bottom and provided strong guidance.Shares were up more than 8% in after-hours trading on Thursday.Here's how the company did compared with LSEG estimates:Earnings per share: 80 cents vs. 51 cents expectedRevenue: $585 million vs. $546 million expectedReddit's sales jumped 68% year-over-year in the third quarter, while net income was $163 million, which was $133 million more than the $30 million it logged the previous year during the same period.The company said it expects fourth-quarter sales to come in the range of $655 million to $665 million, ahead of the $638 million that Wall Street was expecting.Reddit said it expects its adjusted earnings in the fourth quarter to be between $275 million and $285 million, topping StreetAccount's projections of $259 million.The company said third-quarter global average revenue per user was $5.04, ahead of analyst estimates of $4.82.Third-quarter revenue in the U.S. came in at $480 million, surpassing StreetAccount estimates of $445 million. Reddit generated international third-quarter sales of $105 million, ahead of the $104 million that StreetAccount projected.Reddit's \"Other revenue\" category, which includes the company's data licensing business, rose 7% year-over-year to $36 million. Google and OpenAI are the some of Reddit's biggest data licensing partners.The company said global daily active uniques for the third quarter grew 19% year-over-year to 116 million, surpassing analyst estimates of 114 million.Reddit's logged-in DAUq for the U.S., its most lucrative region, rose 7% year-over-year to 23.1 million during the third quarter. That was slower than the 12% year-over-year jump Reddit recorded during the second quarter when logged-in DAUq for the U.S. was 22.9 million. This the fifth quarter in a row in which the company sees its U.S. logged-in user growth slow.The company's third-quarter global logged-in DAUq rose 14% year over year to 50.2 million, while its global logged-out DAUq jumped 24% to 65.8 million.Investors have been watching for any changes to Reddit's user growth amid Google increasingly debuting generative AI features like AI Overview, which provides summaries to search questions. Reddit has seen a wave of users come to its platform from Google, and the social media company makes more advertising-related money from users who create accounts.Reddit CEO Steve Huffman told analysts on Thursday that the company is not currently seeing any major traffic from AI-powered chat apps.\"I'm looking forward to continuing to work on these things with these partners, but they're not a major traffic driver today,\" he said. \"But I think there's plenty of opportunity there as we continue to work together.\"In response to an analyst's question about how Reddit plans to convince more people to create accounts and routinely use its app, Huffman reiterated previous comments about improving the platform's user experience.The company is working on \"making sure there are no barriers\" preventing users from seeing relevant content based on their interests, Huffman said.\"The biggest driver of retention is following subreddits that are relevant to your interests,\" he said. \"It's not rocket science.\"Reddit Chief Operating Officer Jen Wong said that the company is increasingly running performance-marketing campaigns intended to attract more users, particularly those overseas, who may not be aware of the platform. Although the company has not historically relied on marketing to obtain new users, Wong said the promotions will help in countries \"where our awareness and consideration is lower than in the U.S., because we're newer.\"\"We saw an increase in Reddit app installs as a result of a brand campaign, which I think is good,\" Wong said. \"And we saw movement in brand awareness and consideration, which I think was also positive and provides a foundation for performance later.\"Google and Meta both reported their third-quarter earnings on Wednesday in which both tech giants surpassed Wall Street expectations.WATCH: Looking to see if Meta AI can reach consumer scale.watch now",

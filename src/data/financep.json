    "body": "BAE Systems attracted record orders in 2025, and now the UK defense staple is setting its sights on years of growth amid a global ramp-up in spending.Its shares rose 3.6% on Wednesday after its full-year earnings report showed sales soared 10% last year to reach a record £30.7 billion ($41.7 billion).That helped push operating profits to £2.93 billion, a 9% year-on-year increase, as revenues grew 8% to £28.3 billion.The FTSE 100-listed company, which manufactures a range of aircraft, weapons, munitions and warships, saw its order backlog hit £83.6 billion, a £5.8 billion increase from 2024. Now, BAE is preparing to capitalize on years of future growth as geopolitical fissures usher in what CEO Charles Woodburn called a \"new era of defense spending\" driven by \"escalating security challenges.\"The company expects sales to grow by between 7% and 9% in 2026, with guidance for cumulative free cash flow between 2026 and 2028 in excess of £6 billion.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconBAE Systems.\"We're well positioned to provide both the advanced conventional systems and disruptive technologies needed to protect the nations we serve now and into the future,\" Woodburn said in a statement accompanying Wednesday's earnings.\"With a record order backlog and continuing investment in our business to enhance agility, efficiency and capacity, we're confident in our ability to keep delivering growth over the coming years.\"BAE Systems' share price is up 22.6% year-to-date, and more than 57% over the past 12 months.Last year, the company secured £36.8 billion of orders. Highlights included a £4.6 billion deal between the UK and Turkey for 20 Typhoon aircraft and an associated weapons package, as well as a £10 billion agreement with Norway's government to provide Type 26 frigates for its warship program. It also secured a $1.2 billion contract to provide space-based missile-tracking capabilities and other satellite equipment to the U.S. Space Force.Bernstein analysts recently named BAE Systems as one of four European defense stocks that will be critical to the growing push for greater military sovereignty in the region, as nations there turn to continental suppliers for arms and equipment and away from U.S. manufacturers.—CNBC's Sam Meredith contributed to this report.",

    "body": "Germany's huge fiscal expansion is now starting to show up in macro data, and investors are betting it will turbo-charge European growth in the coming months.But defense spending — a cornerstone of the package — could fall short of the ambitious ramp-up this year, a Goldman Sachs note says.The historic fiscal stimulus plan includes a 500 billion euro ($591 billion) off-budget infrastructure investment fund for transport, digital and energy spending, and a defense spending increase of more than 1% of GDP. It's starting to flow through to macroeconomic numbers, Bank of America said this week.BofA analysts highlighted a recent 40% surge in German factory orders on a three-month annualized basis, including bulk orders on heavy machinery, which includes arms and weapons, and electric and electronic equipment. That suggests more orders related to defense, the analysts said.The engine of EuropeA BofA survey of European fund managers showed a record 74% of survey participants expected growth to accelerate in Europe in the coming months. Almost two-thirds (63%) of those polled named Germany's far-reaching fiscal stimulus package as the main catalyst, cementing the country's status as the \"engine of Europe.\"\"Germany continues to be the most preferred equity market in Europe,\" said BofA analysts, led by Andreas Bruckner, in the Feb. 17 note.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconDAX.But a Goldman Sachs analyst has warned that spending on defense and investment will fall short of the government's budget targets this year.German fiscal policy will \"take center stage\" this year, contributing to close to half of the 1.1% growth it expects for Germany in 2026, they predicted. Goldman analysis showed Germany's defense budget has surged by 25 billion euros this year to 119 billion euros — a rise of more than 25%. But given the scale of the ramp-up, execution on the ambitious defense budget will fall short of last year's spend, Niklas Garnadt, senior European economist at Goldman, warned in a Feb. 16 note. That said, Garnadt said he still expected the overall defense spend to increase to reach 109 billion euros — some 2.4% of GDP — this year, a hike of 21 billion euros, or almost 0.5% of GDP.\"Procurement and maintenance account for most of this increase,\" he said. \"Pre-commitments for future procurement and maintenance spending have already increased substantially over the last years and orders for defense-related industries picked up notably in Q4 2025.\"Strategic ambitionsGermany's locking-in of higher military spending forms part of what investors see as a defense \"mega-trend,\" with sustained, longer-term rearmament driving a broader push towards strategic sovereignty for the continent. Speaking at last week's Munich Security Conference, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz warned that the post-World War Two rules-based order \"no longer exists.\" Germany's Rheinmetall — the continent's largest defense company — is one of several stocks seen as well-placed to capitalize on its growing push for military autonomy.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconRheinmetall.By comparison, spending on the various areas of the infrastructure package — transport, energy and climate, and digital — will also see increases, but budget execution is likely to be mixed, Garnadt said.Overall, total federal spending across Germany's main budget and the three major off-budget funds is predicted to grow from 554 billion euros to 600 billion euros. But Garnadt said spending will likely come in lower than budgeted by the government, predicting it would fall some 33 billion short of the \"ambitious\" target.\"While investment in the digitization and climate and energy categories should see lower execution rates, we expect support for hospital investment and loans to social security to be fully executed,\" Garnadt said.\"For transport infrastructure — the largest category — we expect execution above 90%,\" he added.",

Japan's trade deficit surged in September as imports overwhelmed export growth.Kiyoshi Ota | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesJapanese exports climbed 16.8% year on year in January, sharply beating market expectations and growing at their fastest rate since November 2022 as shipments to Asia and Western Europe surged, government data on Wednesday showed.Growth was higher than December's 5.1%, and beat Reuters-polled economists' estimates of 12%.  Value of exports to China, Japan's largest trading partner, jumped 32%, after rising 5.6% in December at a time when the two countries are locked in a diplomatic standoff over Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi's comments over Taiwan.Shipments to the U.S. fell 5%, after declining 11.1% in December. Washington is Japan's second largest trading partner.Region-wise, a near 26% jump in shipments to Asia and over 25% to Western Europe helped accelerate exports growth, and more than offset the 3.3% decline in North America.  Food, machinery and electrical machinery — which includes chips — were commodities that saw the sharpest growth, up 31.3%, 14.3% and 27.3%, respectively. Transport equipment, which contributed over 20% to exports, climbed by 0.8%. The segment, which includes cars and auto parts and has been a key growth driver for Japanese exports, has come under pressure following U.S. tariffs.Japan's Nikkei 225 stock index rose 0.9%, while the broader Topix gained 1.26%.

For the full year, GDP grew 1.1% year on year, also weighed down by net exports. Japanese shipments fell during the middle of 2025, hit by U.S. tariff worries, but saw a rebound toward the end of the year after a trade deal with the U.S. was announced that saw duties slashed to 15%.The U.S. on Tuesday announced projects valued at $36 billion, according to a Reuters report, including an oil export facility in Texas, an industrial diamonds plant in Georgia and a natural gas power plant in Ohio, to be financed by Japan as part of its $550 billion U.S. investment pledge.\"Our MASSIVE Trade Deal with Japan has just launched! Japan is now officially, and financially, moving forward with the FIRST set of Investments under its $550 BILLION Dollar Commitment to invest in the United States of America,\" U.S. President Donald Trump said in a post on Truth Social.Last week, Japan's Economy Minister Ryosei Akazawa was quoted by public broadcaster NHK as saying he hoped the initial projects would be finalized before Takaichi and Trump met.Trump had announced the meeting with Takaichi just before the Feb. 8 Lower House election, which saw Takaichi lead the ruling Liberal Democratic Party to a landslide victory.",

    "body": "Michael Selig, President Donald Trump's nominee to serve as Commodity Futures Trading Commission chairman, testifies in a Senate Agriculture Committee hearing on his nomination on Capitol Hill, Nov. 19, 2025.Jonathan Ernst | ReutersThe Commodity Futures Trading Commission filed an amicus brief in federal court on Tuesday to assert the agency's right to enforce prediction markets instead of individual states, according to its new chairman, Michael Selig.Selig argued in a Monday Wall Street Journal op-ed that the CFTC has always had authority over prediction markets and determining whether the event contracts constitute gambling, as critics allege. Selig noted nearly 50 active legal cases against prediction markets and said the CFTC would be stepping in to prevent state encroachment.\"The CFTC will no longer sit idly by while overzealous state governments undermine the agency's exclusive jurisdiction over these markets by seeking to establish statewide prohibitions on these exciting products,\" he wrote.The move comes as prediction markets like Kalshi and Polymarket face legal challenges in multiple states over event contracts. The platforms allow users to bet on the outcomes of events in pop culture, sports, entertainment and more.Critics of prediction markets have argued that the offerings amount to little more than gambling, though Kalshi has defended its platform and argued that it abides by federal regulations. Sports betting on the prediction platforms has drawn comparisons to legalized sports betting in the U.S. In his first public comments as CFTC chairman at the end of January, Selig said he was prepared to draft new, clear rules to govern prediction markets and revisit the agency's rules on involvement in federal and circuit court cases.\"Where jurisdictional questions are at issue, the Commission has the expertise and responsibility to defend its exclusive jurisdiction over commodity derivatives,\" he said at the time.In his Monday op-ed, Selig said event contracts \"serve legitimate economic functions\" and operate under CFTC rules as \"swaps\" rather than gambling. He also posited that trading on event contracts is beneficial for the market and for Americans at large.\"These exchanges aren't the Wild West, as some critics claim, but self-regulatory organizations that are examined and supervised by experienced CFTC staff,\" Selig wrote.In a Tuesday video posted to X, Selig said his message to those who challenge the CFTC's authority is clear: \"We will see you in court.\"\"Today, the CFTC is taking an important step to ensure that these markets have a place here in America and have the integrity and resilience and vibrancy that our derivative markets deserve,\" he said.Selig said the amicus brief would be filed in the Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in support of Crypto.com in its dispute with the Nevada Gaming Control Board.CNBC could not verify that the amicus brief had been filed.Disclosure: CNBC and Kalshi have a commercial relationship that includes a CNBC minority investment.",

    "body": "Nikolas Kokovlis | Nurphoto | Getty ImagesTesla Europe announced plans to add xAI's Grok, an AI chatbot, to its vehicle infotainment systems in the U.K. and eight other markets across Europe.It remains to be seen if the addition of this technology will revitalize Europeans' interest in buying Teslas.Elon Musk's automaker saw electric vehicle sales in Europe decline by 27%, according to data from the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association, or ACEA. The decline for Tesla came as Europeans' continued strong adoption of battery electric vehicles. BEVs, the only kind that Tesla makes, represented 17.4% of the market across Europe in 2025 according to the ACEA. China's BYD gained market share across the continent with innovative, and more affordable, EV models.Tesla's lack of affordable new models last year, and an ongoing consumer backlash in response to Musk's incendiary political rhetoric, and endorsements of anti-immigrant extremists including Tommy Robinson in the U.K. and Germany's AfD party weighed on the appeal of the Tesla brand last year, according to Brand Finance. Tesla is not the only automaker integrating chatbot features into its infotainment systems. For example, Volvo has announced plans to add a Google Gemini-based conversational AI assistant to its EX60 electric vehicles. During a fourth-quarter earnings update, Tesla revealed that it had invested $2 billion into Musk's xAI.After that, Musk's aerospace and defense juggernaut, SpaceX, acquired xAI in an all-stock transaction that valued the combined entity at $1.25 trillion. Before those deals, xAI had merged with social network X (formerly Twitter), and its Grok product had become the subject of myriad regulatory probes in Asia, Australia and throughout Europe including by regulators in Ireland, the U.K., France and the European Commission.As CNBC previously reported, Grok enabled users to easily create and share deepfake explicit images based on photos or clips of real people without their consent, including deepfake images depicting child sexual abuse. Last summer, Grok generated and spread antisemitic hate speech across social network X and praised Adolf Hitler, drawing earlier regulatory probes by the European Commission.A Tesla owner in Canada raised the alarm about Grok's lack of safeguards after it was added to her vehicle. As CBC reported, her son used Grok to generate entertaining comments about soccer athletes, and Grok eventually asked the minor to send nudes. Tesla and xAI have not said whether they can limit minors' access to Grok in Tesla vehicles, or moderate outputs of the chatbot to be appropriate for minors by default.Besides criticism of Grok's lax safety guardrails, driver distractibility remains a point of concern.Mike Nelson, who is a partner at Nelson Law and an automotive safety researcher, said his own Tesla Model Y features Grok in the U.S., and he has enjoyed using it. However, the addition of chatbot technology to vehicles' infotainment systems, he said, introduces a new \"distraction layer\" for drivers. \"Research shows that even in hands-free mode, you are more distracted when you are talking on the phone and driving,\" Nelson said. \"Adding Grok introduces more stimuli.\" A professor of machine learning and public policy at Carnegie Mellon University, Rayid Ghani, told CNBC that researchers and regulators, and insurance companies especially, should hasten to conduct \"practical evaluations\" of chatbots.With a lack of benchmarking and standards across the industry, he said, \"we do not yet understand the information needs of drivers, how well Grok or other chatbots fulfill those needs compared to other options and whether chatbots may change driving behavior and exactly how.\" Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

    "body": "Arthur Mensch, founder of Mistral AI, during the 'Nvidia GTC' meeting at the 2025 VivaTech conference in Paris, France, on Wednesday, June 11, 2025. Nathan Laine | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesNEW DELHI — More than 50% of enterprises' current software could be replaced by AI, the CEO of Mistral AI told CNBC on Wednesday, potentially adding to investor concerns over software stocks.The comments by Arthur Mensch, CEO of Mistral AI, come after a sell-off in major software names that was sparked in part by Anthropic's Cowork product as investors grow increasingly worried that AI can do more of what current enterprise software does. Investors fear AI could eat into so-called software as a service, or SaaS, business models. The iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF, which counts names such as Microsoft and Salesforce among its top holdings, is down more than 20% this year. In India, major software stocks like Tata Consultancy Services and Infosys have also fallen. \"I would say more than half of what's currently being bought by IT in terms of SaaS is going to shift to AI,\" Mensch told CNBC at the India Accelerates event on the sidelines of the AI Impact Summit in New Delhi, India. \"AI is making us able to develop software at the speed of light,\" Mensch added.watch nowThe Mistral CEO said as long as enterprises have the \"right infrastructure in place\" they're able to connect their data to AI systems to create applications to run certain parts of work.\"Then we do see with our customers ... in a couple of days, we can create fully custom applications to run a workflow, to run a procurement workflow, or to run supply chain workflows, for instance, in a way where I would say five years ago, you would actually need a vertical SaaS.\" Mensch said there is a \"replatforming\" taking place where businesses are looking to use more AI instead of current SaaS. \"The replatforming is a big opportunity for us, because we now have more than 100 enterprise customers coming to us also with that will of maybe changing and replatforming their IT system, so maybe getting rid of certain things that they bought 20 years ago, and that is starting to be a bit expensive,\" Mensch said. \"They see AI as a way to replatform the thing so that it becomes more efficient and less costly.\"Mensch said software focused on systems of records \"are not going to change,\" however. This type of software is responsible for data within an organization and often works in tandem with AI. Bipul Sinha, CEO of Rubrik, has similar views to Mensch. In an interview on Wednesday with CNBC, Sinha said \"workflow software\" could be \"significantly disrupted by AI.\" However, system of record or data infrastructure software that is enabling AI, \"will be a positive.\" Mistral expansion in IndiaMensch also told CNBC that the company plans to open its first office in India this year as it expands into a market that global tech giants are all trying to get a slice of. Mistral is currently working with international companies that have a footprint in India but is now \"prospecting\" potential customers based in the country in both the public and private sectors.While Mistral is building data centers in Europe, the approach will be different in India, with the company planning to partner with companies that already have a physical infrastructure footprint in the country, Mensch said.The Indian government is pushing AI firms to create models that can run locally with data stored domestically. India also has various languages such as Hindi and Punjabi which Mistral said its large language models are able to accommodate. \"That's something that down the line will be super important for the Indian consumer market,\" Mensch said. watch now",

The commitment represents the first tranche of investments by Japan following a landmark trade deal between the two countries, one in which Tokyo pledged to invest $550 billion in American-based projects and Trump cut tariffs on most Japanese imports to 15%.\"Our MASSIVE Trade Deal with Japan has just launched!\" Trump said Tuesday in a social media post.\"The scale of these projects are so large, and could not be done without one very special word, TARIFFS,\" he added. Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi said the projects strengthen the Japan-U.S. alliance and were expected to bring increased sales and business expansion for Japanese companies.\"We believe these initiatives truly embody the purpose of this Strategic Investment Initiative, namely the promotion of mutual benefit between Japan and the United States, the enhancement of economic security, and the promotion of economic growth,\" Takaichi said in a post on X, according to a Google translation.By far the largest investment is a natural gas facility in Ohio that's expected to generate 9.2 gigawatts of power.U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said the Portsmouth Powered Land Project, valued at $33 billion and operated by SB Energy, a subsidiary of Japan's SoftBank, would be \"the largest natural gas generation facility in history.\" Read moreThe White House said Japan would also finance a $2.1 billion deepwater crude oil export facility off the Texas coast. At full capacity, the Texas GulfLink project is expected to generate up to $30 billion in annual U.S. crude exports. Dallas-based energy infrastructure group Sentinel Midstream is developing the project. The Commerce Department said the third major project refers to plans to create a synthetic diamond grit facility in Georgia, with Japan set to invest approximately $600 million.The project is set to be operated by Element Six, part of De Beers Group, the world's leading diamond company. Diamond grit, dust and powder are critical raw materials in U.S. industrial manufacturing due to their exceptional hardness and wear resistance, the Commerce Department said, making the material to U.S. economic and national security.",

    "body": "In an aerial view, two-story single family homes line the streets on Jan. 14, 2026 in Thousand Oaks, California. Kevin Carter | Getty ImagesMortgage interest rates dropped last week to the lowest level in a month, prompting more current borrowers to seek savings in a refinance. While lower rates didn't give potential buyers much incentive, the run on refinances was enough to push total mortgage demand 2.8% higher compared with the previous week, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association's seasonally adjusted index. The average contract interest rate for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages with conforming loan balances, $832,750 or less, decreased to 6.17% from 6.21%, with points remaining unchanged at 0.56, including the origination fee, for loans with a 20% down payment. \"Treasury yields ended the week lower as weaker data on retail sales and home sales outweighed better-than-expected readings on the job market for January,\" said Joel Kan, vice president and deputy chief economist at the MBA, in a release. As a result, applications to refinance a home loan rose 7% for the week and were 132% higher than the same week one year ago. Last year, rates were 76 basis points higher. While that annual jump may seem large, refinancing was at extremely low levels at this time last year. \"Refinance applications increased across all loan types, marking the strongest week for refinancing since mid-January,\" Kan added.Get Property Play directly to your inboxCNBC's Property Play with Diana Olick covers new and evolving opportunities for the real estate investor, delivered weekly to your inbox.Subscribe here to get access today.Applications for a mortgage to purchase a home dropped 3% for the week and were just 8% higher than the same week one year ago. While lower mortgage rates are making homes slightly more affordable, new supply is not coming onto the market fast enough, and concern over the broader economy has consumers sitting on the sidelines. Mortgage rates didn't move at all to start this holiday-shortened week, but economic data set for release this week could impact the current trajectory. In general, however, mortgage rates have been hovering in a pretty narrow range, between 6% and 6.25%, since the start of this year. ",

    "body": "The Late Show with Stephen Colbert and on Tuesday, Sept. 2, 2025. Scott Kowalchyk | CBS | Getty Images\"Late Show\" host Stephen Colbert on Tuesday night called CBS's denial of his claim that it blocked the broadcast of his interview with Texas state Rep. James Talarico \"crap\" — and urged the network and its parent, Paramount Skydance, to stand up to the \"bullies\" in the Trump administration.Colbert's broadside came hours after CBS issued a statement on the controversy. The host, whose show will end in May as it was canceled by CBS, held up a printed copy of the network's statement about Talarico's interview during his show Tuesday night and said, \"I don't even know what to do with this crap.\"He then pulled a plastic doggy bag from behind his desk, picked up the statement, tied a knot, and mimed throwing it away before cutting to commercial.The controversy is the latest flap to spark speculation that CBS is currying favor with the Trump administration as Paramount makes a hostile tender bid for Warner Bros Discovery. If WBD's shareholders accept Paramount's bid, the federal government regulators would need to sign off on the deal.Colbert had invited Talarico, who is running in the Democratic primary for a U.S. Senate seat from Texas, to appear on the \"Late Show\" for Monday night's broadcast. But early in that night's show, Colbert said to his studio audience that CBS' lawyers had told him \"in no uncertain terms ... that we could not have him on the broadcast.\" Colbert said the lawyers wanted to avoid running afoul of new guidance by the Federal Communications Commission Chairman Brendan Carr that suggests broadcast talk shows could be required to abide by the so-called equal time provision requiring broadcasters to give political candidates equal coverage if their opponents appear on air.Colbert noted that he had put Talarico's interview on the \"Late Show\" YouTube channel — the video has been seen more than 4.4 million times.CBS, in its statement on Tuesday afternoon, denied Colbert's main allegation that it had barred the interview from being aired.\"The Late Show was not prohibited by CBS from broadcasting the interview with Rep. James Talarico,\" the network said.\"The show was provided legal guidance that the broadcast could trigger the FCC equal-time rule for two other candidates, including Rep. Jasmine Crockett [D-Texas], and presented options for how the equal time for other candidates could be fulfilled,\" CBS said.Colbert scoffed at the statement during Tuesday's show.\"They know damn well that every word of my script last night was approved by CBS lawyers who, for the record, approved every script that goes on the air,\" Colbert said.\"In fact, between the monologue I did last night, and before I did the second act talking about this issue, I had to go backstage,\" he said. \"I got called backstage to get more notes from these lawyers. Something that had never, ever happened before, and they told us the language they wanted me to use to describe that equal time exception, and I used that language,\" Colbert said. \"So I don't know what this is about.\"Colbert went on to say that he wasn't \"mad\" at the network and does not want an \"adversarial relationship.\"\"I'm just so surprised that this giant global corporation would not stand up to these bullies,\" he said.\"Come on. You're Paramount. No, no, no, you're more than that. You're Paramount+,\" Colbert cracked. \"And for the lawyers to release this [statement] without even talking to me is really surprising.\"The host also noted that there has long been \"a very famous exception to\" the equal time rule, \"and that exception included talk shows, interviews with politicians.\"\"We looked, and we can't find one example of this rule being enforced for any talk show interview, not only for my entire late-night career, but for anyone's late-night career, going back to the 1960s,\" he said.Colbert said that Carr has \"not gotten rid of\" that exception for talk-show hosts \"yet.\"\"But CBS generously did it for him and told me, unilaterally, that I had to abide by the equal time rules, something I have never been asked to do for an interview in the 20 years of this job,\" he added.\"Now, that decision, I want to be clear, is their right, just like I have the right to talk about their decision on air last night,\" Colbert said.Paramount did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment.Early voting in the Texas Democratic primary began Tuesday. Talarico is in a close contest against Rep. Jasmine Crockett. The winner will face the victor of the Republican primary between Sen. John Cornyn and Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton. Democrats have not won a statewide race in Texas since 1994.",

Timothy A.clary | AFP | Getty ImagesThe Trump administration was sued Tuesday over the abrupt removal of the Pride rainbow flag last week from the Stonewall National Monument in New York City, at the site of the 1969 uprising that ignited the gay rights movement in the United States.The lawsuit, filed by a group of LGBTQ+ advocates and a Greenwich Village community group, said the federal government claimed that Department of the Interior rules bar the flying of anything but the U.S. flags, DOI flags, and the POW/MIA flags in national parks.\"In fact, the opposite is true: The policies the government says require removing the Pride flag expressly permit the [National Park Service] to fly other flags that provide historical context to national monuments — which is precisely what the NPS official Pride flag did at Stonewall for many years,\" the lawsuit says.The lawsuit was filed in U.S. District Court in Manhattan a day after a federal judge in Philadelphia ordered the National Park Service to restore an exhibit at Independence National Historical Park that contained information about the nine slaves who lived with President George Washington in the official presidential residence in Philadelphia in the 1790s. That order will remain in effect pending the outcome of the city of Philadelphia's lawsuit challenging the NPS's removal of the exhibit in January.The Pride flag had flown at the Stonewall National Monument since 2022 after a flagpole was installed there.The monument is located across from the Stonewall Inn, where a July 1969 police raid of the then-underground gay bar was resisted by patrons, and followed by days of riots and protests.\"Before the 1960s, almost everything about living authentically as a lesbian, a bisexual person or a gay man was illegal,\" the NPS page for the monument says. \"The Stonewall Uprising on June 28, 1969 is a milestone in the quest for civil rights and provided momentum for a movement.People gather in protest at the Stonewall National Monument after the Trump administration had the National Park Service remove the LGBTQ+ Pride flag from the site, which is considered the birthplace of the modern LGBTQ+ rights movement, on Feb. 10, 2026, in New York City.Spencer Platt | Getty ImagesThe new lawsuit in Manhattan federal court called the flag's removal on Feb. 9 \"a textbook example of an arbitrary and capricious act.\"\"This was no careless mistake,\" the suit says. \"The government has not removed other historical flags at other national monuments, most notably Confederate flags. Meanwhile, the assault on Stonewall is the latest example in a long line of efforts by the Trump Administration to target the LGBTQ+ community for discrimination and opprobrium.\"New York Mayor Zohran Mamdani, in a Feb. 10 post on X, said, \"I am outraged by the removal of the Rainbow Pride Flag from Stonewall National Monument.\"\"New York is the birthplace of the modern LGBTQ+ rights movement, and no act of erasure will ever change, or silence, that history,\" Mamdani said.Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, on Sunday said he would introduce a bill to make \"the Pride Flag a congressionally authorized symbol.\"Read more CNBC politics coverageEpstein files: DOJ says it logs Congress members' searches to 'protect' victim informationEpstein files: AG Pam Bondi seemed to have Rep.

    "body": "Pumps and pipes divert raw sewage on Feb. 16, 2026, into the C&O Canal and around a broken section of the Potomac Interceptor, a 6-foot-wide pipe that collapsed on Jan. 19 between the Clara Barton Parkway and the canal in Cabin John, Maryland.Chip Somodevilla | Getty ImagesPresident Donald Trump on Tuesday stepped up a feud with Democratic leaders of Maryland, Virginia and Washington over a massive sewage spill into the Potomac River, and it's turning into a messy political battle. More than 200 million gallons of wastewater gushed into the Potomac in recent weeks. A pipe collapsed in January on the Potomac Interceptor sewage line alongside the Clara Barton Parkway in Maryland, just outside of the District of Columbia. The pipe and the sewage line are managed by DC Water, an independent utility that serves the capital area and is managing the disaster.Trump on Tuesday demanded regional Democratic leaders ask him for help in fixing the spill, seemingly backtracking after he announced on Monday that his administration would be taking over the recovery effort. \"The two Governors and the Mayor of D.C. must act, IMMEDIATELY,\" Trump said in a Truth Social post on Tuesday, referring to Democratic Govs. Wes Moore of Maryland, Abigail Spanberger of Virginia and D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser, also a Democrat. \"If they can't do the job, they have to call me and ask, politely, to get it fixed. The Federal Government is not at all involved with what has taken place, but we can fix it.\"Trump on Monday singled out Moore in another Truth Social post on the spill, saying it is a \"result of the Gross Mismanagement of Local Democrat Leaders, particularly, Governor Wes Moore, of Maryland.\"The sewage spat comes amid a series of feuds the president is waging with state executives, especially Moore, who is seen as a potential Democratic presidential contender in 2028. It's also the latest example of Trump leveraging the bully pulpit of the presidency to bludgeon his political rivals, including Moore. Moore responded in a post on X to Trump's post saying the spill is \"basically contained\" and asking the White House to instead help with emergency funding to help the state recover from flooding last year.Read more CNBC politics coverageEpstein files: DOJ says it logs Congress members' searches to 'protect' victim informationEpstein files: AG Pam Bondi seemed to have Rep.

Wes Moore speaks on the day of President Joe Biden's visit to Dundalk Marine Terminal, in Baltimore, Maryland, Oct. 29, 2024.Elizabeth Frantz | ReutersAmmar Moussa, a spokesperson for Moore, said it's Trump, not Maryland, who is responsible for the Potomac Interceptor and accused the president of shirking responsibility. \"Since the last century, the federal government has been responsible for the Potomac Interceptor, which is the origin of the sewage leak,\" Moussa said in a statement. \"Apparently the Trump administration hadn't gotten the memo that they're actually supposed to be in charge here. Where the president has failed to act, Maryland has played its part to protect residents, protect drinking water, and ensure accountability.\"Moore's office said that because the Potomac Interceptor is owned and operated by DC Water, it is a piece of federally regulated infrastructure under the oversight of the Environmental Protection Agency.The governor's office added that he would be willing to work with federal authorities if they are willing to assist with the recovery. \"If the federal government is just now showing up to take action, we will work collaboratively — as we always do — to be responsive and keep the public informed about the federal government's plan to remediate the damage,\" Moussa said. \"The Potomac isn't a talking point, and the people of the region deserve serious leadership that meets the moment.\"The White House, however, is doubling down on blaming local elected Democrats for the disaster. \"President Trump will not allow the failures of local and state Democrats to diminish the quality of life for millions of Americans,\" Taylor Rogers, a White House spokesperson, said in a statement to CNBC. \"In line with the President's promise to make Washington, D.C. safe and beautiful, President Trump may be forced to step in and fix this disaster created by Democrats, whose gross mismanagement has allowed millions of gallons of raw sewage to be dumped into the Potomac River.\"A White House official speaking on condition of anonymity said Maryland is responsible for Potomac River water quality standards within its borders and for enforcing regulations requiring \"sewage system operators to report, monitor and mitigate unauthorized discharges that affect surface waters of the state.\"The sewage leak has not had an impact on drinking water in Washington, according to DC Water. The overflow was stopped in late January, and sewage is now being bypassed around the broken pipe. Due to the raw sewage released into the river, however, the district's Department of Energy and Environment has warned residents to avoid the river. The Potomac is a source of drinking water for the District of Columbia, and it's a popular location for kayaking and other recreation.The Environmental Protection Agency said it is able to support the recovery effort if it is asked to. \"At no point has DC Water or the state of Maryland requested EPA to take over their responsibilities, and EPA has continued to offer its full support to state and local leaders from the onset. We are always ready to step in and assist with our exceptional team,\" the EPA press office said in a statement to CNBC. \"The Potomac Interceptor overflow is a sewage crisis of historic proportion. Never should any American family, community, or waterway ever have to experience this level of extensive environmental damage,\" the press office said. ",

    "body": "A customer looks at goods on a shelf in a supermarket on January 15, 2025 in London, England. Dan Kitwood | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesThe U.K. inflation rate cooled to 3% in January, according to the latest figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS).Economists polled by Reuters had expected the consumer price index to fall to 3%, down from 3.4% in the twelve months to December.Core inflation, excluding energy, food, alcohol, and tobacco, stood at 3.1% in January, down from 3.2% in December. The fall in Inflation, to its lowest annual rate since March 2025, was driven partly by a decrease in petrol prices, the ONS' Chief Economist Grant Fitzner said in comments on X.\"Airfares were another downward driver this month with prices dropping back following the increase in December. Lower food prices also helped push the rate down, particularly for bread and cereals and meat. These were partially offset by the cost of hotel stays and takeaways,\" he noted.Sterling was flat against the dollar following the as-expected data, at $1.3562.The data will be closely analysed by the Bank of England as it looks for further signs to confirm its view that inflation will fall close to the central bank's 2% target by April. U.K. jobs and wage data out Tuesday gave the BOE further signs of weakness in the labor market and an easing of inflationary pressures with the unemployment rate rising to 5.2% in December, the highest level in five years. Annual wage growth, a key inflation metric closely watched by the central bank, weakened in the last three months of 2025.watch nowGrowth data released last week showed the wider slowdown continued, with the economy growing a meager 0.1% in the fourth quarter. We'll get another shot of economic activity in the country this coming Friday when purchasing managers' index (PMI) data is released.Economists expect that the latest batch of data could prompt the BOE to cut its benchmark interest rate, currently at 3.75%, at its next meeting in March. \"Sticky inflation has been the Achilles' heel for the UK for a number of years, requiring the Bank of England to keep interest rates restrictive. But it appears that we have finally turned a corner,\" Zara Nokes, global market analyst at J.P. Morgan Asset Management, said in emailed comments Wednesday. \"Today's data showed a meaningful step down in headline inflation, with broad-based disinflation across sectors. Crucially, this progress should continue with headline inflation likely to fall in touching distance of the 2% target by April,\" she added. \"The recent moderation in wage growth should also help to keep all-important services inflation – which has been a thorn in the Bank of England's side for a number of years – at bay,\" Nokes said, noting that the BOE likely has room to deliver another couple of 25-basis-point rate cuts before hitting the neutral rate. \"Based on the latest string of employment data, I would expect these cuts to be front-loaded,\" she said.The gloomy picture painted by recent U.K. growth figures and Tuesday's evidence of a lackluster jobs market has increased the likelihood that the BOE will cut rates at the next meeting in March, Danni Hewson,  head of financial analysis at AJ Bell, said in emailed comments Tuesday. \"It has also increased expectation that rates could reach as low as 3% by the end of the year,\" Hewson added.",

Revenue is expected to hit $2.94 billion to $2.95 billion, topping a $2.60 billion estimate.Revenue grew 15% from $2.3 billion a year ago, the company said. Net income totaled $432 million, or 61 cents per share, up from $267 million, or 38 cents per share a year ago.Palo Alto also said on Tuesday that it's buying Israeli cybersecurity startup Koi to secure AI agents as rising artificial intelligence innovation fuels more sophisticated cyberattacks. The company has bet big on AI tools, and recently launched AI agents to help customers automate certain security responses.The company is also in the midst of a significant spending spree as CEO Nikesh Arora transforms Palo Alto into a hub for all things cybersecurity. Since joining the company in 2018, he's overseen more than 20 acquisitions.Earlier this month, the Santa Clara, California-based company closed its biggest acquisition ever, paying $25 billion for Israeli identity security company CyberArk. In January, it closed the more than $3 billion purchase of cloud observability platform Chronosphere.\"We saw continued strength in platformizations, a trend that is accelerating due to AI - customers are keen to both modernize and normalize their cybersecurity stack, aligning them to our approach,\" Arora wrote in a release. Remaining performance obligations, which track the value of contracts to be delivered to customers, totaled $16 billion and topped a StreetAccount estimate of $15.78 billion. Annual recurring revenue rose 33% to $6.33 billion.Palo Alto shares have slumped 11% year to date.

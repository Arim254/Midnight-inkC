    "body": "Activity on Elizabeth Street (at the intersection of Bourke St Mall), Melbourne on a cloudy day.Charlie Rogers | Moment | Getty ImagesAustralia's inflation came in at 3.6% in the fourth quarter of 2025, its highest level in six quarters, reinforcing warnings from policymakers that interest rate cuts this year are likely to be limited.The fourth-quarter reading was in line with expectations from economists polled by Reuters and up from the 3.2% seen in the third quarter. On a quarterly basis, inflation rose 0.6%, also matching the Reuters forecast and easing sharply from the 1.3% seen in the previous quarter.For December, inflation in Australia rose 3.8% year on year, exceeding the 3.55% expected by economists.The Australian Bureau of Statistics said housing was the largest contributor to the rise in December, with prices rising 5.5%.Prices of food and non-alcoholic beverages, as well as recreation and culture, also contributed to the month's price gains.The higher inflation reading will prompt the central bank to maintain a \"cautious stance,\" according to Shier Lee Lim, Lead FX & Macro Strategist for Asia Pacific at foreign exchange firm Convera. While Lim said a rate hike at the bank's February policy meeting is unlikely, further tightening cannot be ruled out if inflation remains sticky and above target in the coming quarters.The Reserve Bank of Australia aims to keep inflation within a 2% to 3% target range.'Too high' for rate cutsThe inflation reading follows recent comments from Reserve Bank of Australia Deputy Governor Andrew Hauser, who said that inflation at current levels is \"too high.\" \"Inflation above 3%, let's be clear, is too high. We're charged to keep inflation between two to three per cent and it's currently above that,\" Hauser said in an interview with ABC on Jan. 8. Hauser said the likelihood of further rate cuts in the near term was \"probably very low.\"His remarks echoed comments from RBA Governor Michele Bullock after the RBA's rate decision on Dec. 9, when she said that interest rate cuts were not on the horizon for the foreseeable future.Australia's economy grew 2.1% in the third quarter, expanding from a revised 2% in the second quarter and marking its fastest growth in about two years. Bullock said in December that rate cuts were not needed at that time, citing a recovery in private-sector activity and growth surpassing public demand.",

    "body": "A \"sale pending\" sign in front of a home for sale in Larkspur, California, Nov. 30, 2023.Justin Sullivan | Getty ImagesSerious headwinds in the housing market and the broader economy are tanking home sales at an alarming rate.More than 40,000 signed home purchase agreements were canceled in December, representing 16.3% of all homes that went under contract, according to Redfin, a real estate brokerage. That's up from 14.9% in December 2024. It's is also the highest share since Redfin began tracking the metric in 2017.\"High housing costs and rising inventory have made homebuyers more selective,\" said Chen Zhao, head of economics research at Redfin. \"Home sellers outnumber buyers by a record margin, meaning the buyers who are in the market have options and may walk away if they believe they can find a better or more affordable home.\" Get Property Play directly to your inboxCNBC's Property Play with Diana Olick covers new and evolving opportunities for the real estate investor, delivered weekly to your inbox.Subscribe here to get access today.There were roughly 47% more home sellers than buyers in the market in December — or 631,535 more — according to a separate Redfin report. That is the largest gap in records dating back to 2013 and up 7.1 percentage points from the previous month. \"I call 2025 the year of the seller, because I had so many sellers reach out,\" said Ashley Rummage, a real estate agent from Raleigh, North Carolina, who participated in the most recent CNBC Housing Market Survey. \"They were reaching out because they had a lot of fear around the economy. They had a lot of uncertainty around the current administration, mortgage rates, affordability. These are all challenges this year.\"Regionally, Atlanta saw the highest percentage of contract cancellations in December at 22.5%. That was followed by Jacksonville, Florida, at 20.6%; San Antonio at 20.6%; Cleveland at 20.2%; and Tampa, Florida at 19.4%. Cancellations were the least common in the New York metropolitan area, San Francisco and San Jose, California.Pending sales actually dropped an outsized 9% in December from November, according to the National Association of Realtors, so the numbers were already low. Given the high rate of cancellations, closed sales in January and February are likely to be quite weak. ",

    "body": "A five-month process of finding the next Federal Reserve chair appears to be down to its final days, with one candidate emerging as the betting favorite even as others remain in the mix.BlackRock fixed income chief Rick Rieder is seen by prediction markets as the frontrunner to replace Jerome Powell at the helm of the central bank. Kalshi has the Wall Street veteran holding a 48% chance, well ahead of the next-closest competitor, former Governor Kevin Warsh, at 31%.But sentiment has been volatile, and it was Warsh who held a decided advantage less than a week ago.What has swung the pendulum seems tenuous: In a CNBC interview at the World Economic Forum, Trump called Rieder \"very impressive,\" and a Bloomberg News report, citing unnamed sources, said White House officials generally liked Rieder.While that was enough to sway wagers on sites like Kalshi and Polymarket, some on Wall Street are less convinced and still see it as a competitive race yet to be decided by a notoriously fickle president. With Warsh still well in the mix, some analysts also think the market's move away from National Economic Council (NEC) director Kevin Hassett is at least too hasty.The Kevins are still aliveWhile acknowledging market sentiment about Rieder, Tobin Marcus, head of U.S. policy and politics at Wolfe Research, said in a note that \"we remain unconvinced\" on the money manager, adding, \"We think both Kevins are still strong possibilities.\"\"Just last week, Trump was continuing to strongly emphasize 'loyalty' as a criterion, which is an obstacle for Rieder,\" Marcus added. \"If this is still the President's mindset, that seems like an obvious problem for Rieder, who is in no way a loyalist ... We also continue to think betting markets are misinterpreting Trump's comments on Hassett.\"That's a reference to Trump, in a recent White House conversation with reporters, emphasizing that he would miss Hassett at the NEC and would prefer to see him stay in that role. However, neither Trump nor any White House officials who have spoken about the matter have dismissed Hassett as a contender. Marcus wrote off the Trump comment about Hassett as \"a cheeky quip\" that may not represent his feelings about filling the Fed chair.Former Fed Vice Chair Roger Ferguson voiced similar views in a CNBC interview Monday, saying he still thinks the decision comes down to \"one of the Kevins.\"\"Only one person knows, and the rest of us are speculating,\" Ferguson added. He called Rieder a \"qualified person [and] Wall Street favorite ... but I really think it's unlikely that he'll be the first one across the finish line.\"There's also the possibility that Trump could play a wild card in the form of hiring someone not thought to be among the finalists. He has stated previously that he would like to name Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent to the job but that the former hedge fund manager doesn't want it.Neither Rieder nor White House officials returned a request for comment.Looking at RiederShould he look Rieder's way, Trump would get someone who fits his views in many ways, including a desire for lower interest rates and a willingness to use the Fed's balance sheet to guide the economy.After the Fed approved a quarter percentage point cut in December, the third such move in a row, Rieder wrote, \"rates are still too high for the housing market to [recover] its buoyancy, and small businesses (important providers of new jobs) and young households are still struggling.\" He noted that the fed funds rate \"is excessively blunt to deal with issues better resolved through fiscal channels.\"Rieder would be an interesting choice for a number of reasons, not least because he represents a firm that is the face of globalist finance and would serve under a president known for his anti-globalist views. Though Trump has many times expressed his distaste for Powell and threatened to fire him more than once, Rieder would carry a huge similarity to the current chair in that neither has a PhD in economics, instead holding market-rich backgrounds. In Rieder's case, that meant a long stint at Lehman Brothers before the Wall Street investment banking titan imploded in 2008, an event associated with the beginning of the global financial crisis.At BlackRock, Rieder engineers a $2.5 trillion bond portfolio that includes the $14.5 billion iShares Flexible Income Active exchange-traded fund. The entire firm manages $14 trillion in client money and runs the government's Thrift Savings Plan, a federal employees' retirement fund. Moreover, the Fed called on BlackRock during the Covid crisis in 2020 to manage its controversial purchases of corporate bonds aimed at steadying capital flows at a time of extreme economic peril. Like other major financial firms and primary dealers, BlackRock officials, including its influential CEO Larry Fink, are in continuous contact with the Fed.Fed independencePotential downsides, at least from Trump's view, might be that Rieder has stated he'd like to see the Fed's key interest rate around 3%, only about half a percentage point below its current level and above desired by the president and other White House officials. He has also expressed support for Fed independence and seems unlikely to take marching orders from Trump.In a separate appearance at the World Economic Forum — held each year in Davos, Switzerland, where BlackRock plays a huge role — Trump mused about the difficulty in finding a Fed chair who would do his bidding. Few if any presidents in U.S. history have been so open about trying to influence monetary policy.\"They get the job, they're locked in for six years. They get the job and all of a sudden, 'let's raise rates a little bit,'\" Trump said, misstating the length of the four-year terms for chairs. \"It's amazing how people change once they have the job. It's too bad. It's sort of disloyalty. But they've got to do what they think is right.\"While Trump may again become dissatisfied with the next Fed chair, markets likely will welcome whomever Trump chooses, including Rieder, at least among those considered in the running.\"The BlackRock fixed income CIO, who has not worked in a policy position before, would bring a perspective grounded in deep granular bottoms-up analysis of corporate data rather than economic theory and models,\" wrote Krishna Guha, head of global policy and central bank strategy at Evercore ISI. \"The market would likely welcome Rieder as one of its own.\"",

Photographer: Qilai Shen/Bloomberg via Getty ImagesBloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesSouth Korea's SK Hynix on Wednesday posted record quarterly revenue and profit, boosted by surging memory prices and demand from generative AI chipsets, as it battles rival Samsung for the status as the world's top memory producer. Here are the company's results versus LSEG SmartEstimates, which are weighted toward forecasts from analysts who are more consistently accurate:Revenue: 32.827 trillion won ($23 billion) vs. 32.132 trillion won expectedOperating profit: 19.17 trillion won vs. 17.729 trillion won expectedRevenue rose about 66% in the December quarter compared with the same period a year earlier, while operating profit surged 137% over the same period.SK Hynix makes memory chips used to store data, which are found in everything from servers to consumer devices such as smartphones and laptops.The company has benefited from a boom in artificial intelligence as a key supplier of high-bandwidth memory, or HBM chips, used to power AI data center servers. HBM falls into the broader category of dynamic random access memory, or DRAM — a type of semiconductor memory used to store data and program code that can be found in PCs, workstations and servers.\"HBM revenue more than doubled year-on-year, making a significant contribution to the company's record performance [last year],\" it said in its earnings report. Demand for HBM has far outpaced what memory makers have been able to supply, with the impacts on manufacturers' capacity also triggering shortages for less advanced memory chips used in consumer electronics and EVs. As a result of this environment, memory prices have been surging, with shortages expected to last into next year as companies like SK Hynix wait for more capacity expansions to come online. SK Hynix also announced on Wednesday plans to cancel treasury shares worth 12.24 trillion won, a move aimed at boosting shareholder value. The announcement followed a surge in the memory maker's share price on Tuesday after local media reported that it had become the exclusive supplier of advanced memory chips for a new AI processor developed by Microsoft.SK Hynix will hold an earnings call with investors on Thursday. Samsung, SK Hynix's leading competitor in the memory market, including HBM, is also set to report earnings today.",

    "body": "onathan Raa | Nurphoto | Getty ImagesASML reported on Wednesday orders that smashed past expectations while 2026 sales guidance was also ahead of estimates as AI demand continues to support the Dutch chip giant's business. Bookings, one of the most closely-watched metrics from investors, came in at 13.2 billion euros ($15.8 billion) in the fourth quarter of 2025, ahead of analyst expectations of 6.32 billion euros, according to Visible Alpha, as cited by Reuters. This was a record quarter for orders, according to ASML's finance chief Roger Dassen.ASML also announced a 12-billion-euro share buyback plan to be executed by Dec. 31, 2028. The company said it expects net sales in the current quarter of between 8.2 billion and 8.9 billion euros and total sales for 2026 to come in at between 34 billion euros and 39 billion euros. The mid-point is above analyst expectations of 35.1 billion. ASML previously said it does not expect 2026 total net sales to be below 2025. The company's forecast points to revenue growth of at least 20% compared to 2024, signaling an improvement on its prior commentary on 2026, when a rise in revenue was uncertain.Here's how ASML did versus LSEG consensus estimates for the fourth quarter:Net sales: 9.7 billion euros ($11.6 billion) versus 9.6 billion euros expectedNet profit: 2.84 billion euros vs 3.01 billion euros expectedASML also announced on Wednesday that it was going to make layoffs which would result in a net reduction of around 1,700 positions, mostly in the Netherlands, with some in the United States. In some cases the company's way of working has become \"less agile\" and the job cuts are intended to address this issue, the company said.AI tailwindsASML, which makes tools required to manufacture the most advanced chips in the world, is experiencing several tailwinds, driven by the AI infrastructure boom, that have pushed its shares up nearly 30% this year alone.Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC) this month posted another record rise in profit in the fourth quarter, adding to the narrative that demand for AI chips and infrastructure will continue. TSMC, a customer of ASML, is the world's biggest chipmaker and manufactures semiconductors for companies from Nvidia to AMD. Meanwhile, there is a shortage of memory semiconductors, causing an unprecedented jump in prices of the component, with some in the electronics industry expecting the crunch to continue through 2027. Analysts forecast that the world's biggest memory makers including Samsung and SK Hynix will increase chipmaking capacity in the coming year or two, which would mean these firms will purchase more ASML machines.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconASML shares year-to-dateFor example, Barclays said in a note this month that it expects SK Hynix to take 12 of ASML's extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography machines in 2026.ASML's CFO said that its customers have been \"more positive in their assessment of the medium-term market perspectives.\"\"I think it's primarily on the basis of the more robust view that they have when it comes to demand for AI, which seems to be more sustainable from their vantage point,\" Dassen said in a transcript of a video interview. \"That recognition has led some of our customers to really invest in capacity and gear up their plans for medium-term capacity expansion.\"Revenue from EUV machines, which are among the most advanced machines ASML produces, will \"significantly go up\" in 2026 compared to last year as chipmakers expand production of more advanced semiconductors, ASML said.China in focusInvestors are looking out for any commentary on China, a market where ASML is not allowed to ship its most advanced machines due to export restrictions. The Dutch semiconductor giant said last year that it expects sales in China to decline significantly in 2026 compared to 2024 and 2025.ASML said it expects China revenue to account for 20% of its total sales in 2026. Last year, China accounted for 33% of ASML's net system sales. ",

Speaking to reporters during a visit to Iowa to promote his economic record, Trump was asked if he was comfortable with the current value of the greenback and if he thought it had fallen too much after sliding 10% over the past year. \"I think it's great,\" Trump said of the weaker dollar. \"I mean the value of the dollar, look at the business we're doing. No, [the] dollar is doing great.

    "body": "British Prime Minister Keir Starmer at Downing Street on January 27, 2026 in London, England. Jack Taylor | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesBEIJING — Nearly 60 British businesses and cultural organizations will join U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer on his trip to China this week, the first such state visit in eight years.Starmer is due to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping and Premier Li Qiang on Thursday to discuss trade, investment and national security, according to an official U.K. readout that listed the business representatives accompanying the British leader.The group includes financial industry leaders such as HSBC Group Chairman Brendan Nelson and Aberdeen Group CEO Jason Windsor.Aircraft giant Airbus's general counsel John Harrison will also join, along with British Airways Chief Commercial Officer Colm Lacy.Pharmaceutical executives accompanying Starmer include AstraZeneca CEO Pascal Soriot and GSK Chair Sir Jonathan Symonds.The visit comes as Beijing hosts a series of foreign leaders this month amid escalating U.S. tensions with its trading partners and disputes involving Greenland. Earlier this month, Canada's Prime Minister Mark Carney visited Beijing. On the first Monday of 2026, Xi met Ireland's Prime Minister Michael Martin — the first visit by an Irish leader in 14 years — and hosted South Korea's President Lee Jae Myung later in the day. Xi also met Finnish Prime Minister Petteri Orpo Tuesday. The timing of Starmer's trip has drawn attention. Last week, the British government approved plans to open a new sprawling Chinese Embassy in London after the proposal had stalled for years over political and security concerns. London has sought to bolster new trade and investment ties with Beijing as U.S. President Donald Trump's foreign policy and tariff threats have unsettled traditional allies, including the European Union and Canada.Trump previously floated a 10% tariff on European countries that opposed his bid to acquire Greenland before backing down. He also threatened to impose 100% tariffs on Canada if Ottawa pursued a free trade deal with China.Starmer will \"push for access in areas where better co-operation with China would boost growth and deliver prosperity for the British people,\" including financial services, creative industries and life sciences, the British government said in the statement.But \"he will be clear that we will not trade economic co-operation for our national security. He will raise the areas where we disagree with China,\" it said, stressing the need for \"frank and open dialogue.\"",

    "body": "Amazon logo on brick office building facade with windows, San Francisco, California, Aug. 29, 2025.Smith Collection | Gado | Archive Photos | Getty ImagesAmazon on Tuesday sent a notice out to cloud staffers in an apparent error acknowledging \"organizational changes\" at the company.The e-commerce giant is expected to announce widespread layoffs across its corporate workforce as soon as this week, a person familiar with the matter previously told CNBC. Amazon's cloud computing and stores units are among the divisions that are expected to be impacted. \"Changes like this are hard on everyone,\" Colleen Aubrey, senior vice president of applied AI solutions at Amazon Web Services, wrote in an email viewed by CNBC. \"These decisions are difficult and are made thoughtfully as we position our organization and AWS for future success.\"The note also references a post from Amazon's HR boss Beth Galetti and said the company notified \"impacted colleagues in our organization.\" The subject of the email mentions \"Project Dawn,\" and the email says it was \"canceled,\" possibly indicating it was recalled by the sender after the fact. It's unclear what Project Dawn refers to.Representatives from Amazon didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. The job cuts come after Amazon announced in October that it would lay off 14,000 corporate employees. At the time, the company indicated the cuts would continue in 2026 as it found \"additional places we can remove layers.\" Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said the layoffs were meant to reduce management layers and bureaucracy inside the company. He also predicted last June that efficiency gains from AI would shrink Amazon's corporate staff in the coming years.Earlier on Tuesday, the company announced it was reorganizing its grocery business. Amazon said it will shutter its Fresh supermarkets and Go convenience marts to prioritize investments in Whole Foods stores and online grocery delivery. Amazon's top grocery executive Jason Buechel told staffers in a memo that the company needs to make more \"deliberate choices\" to win over customers. He also announced other restructuring moves in the division, including that he plans to appoint a \"grocery quality\" leadership role. The company is slated to report fourth-quarter earnings after the bell on Feb. 5.WATCH: Amazon CEO Andy Jassy: 'Unprecedented' how much AI compute is being consumed right nowwatch now",

Patrick Doyle | ReutersCanadian Prime Minister Mark Carney on Tuesday denied Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent's claim that, in a private call with President Donald Trump, he had backtracked on some of the remarks from his much-discussed speech in Davos, Switzerland, last week.\"To be absolutely clear, and I said this to the president, I meant what I said in Davos,\" Carney told reporters in Ottawa on Tuesday morning, pushing back on Bessent's remarks from the night before.Bessent, in a Fox News interview Monday night had said Carney was \"very aggressively walking back some of the unfortunate remarks he made at Davos\" during a call with Trump earlier in the day.In his address to the World Economic Forum, Carney had declared that the established U.S.-led world order was in the \"midst of a rupture.\" And he pointedly warned that the \"bargain\" of an American hegemony \"no longer works,\" adding that \"great powers\" have exploited and weaponized economic tools like tariffs.The speech — which came as Trump was aggressively pressuring Europe to sell Denmark-owned Greenland to the U.S. — received a rare standing ovation at Davos.Read more CNBC politics coverageTrump says he wants 'very honorable and honest investigation' of Alex Pretti killingDemocrats to Trump: Fire Kristi Noem or risk her impeachmentThe government is barreling toward a partial shutdown over DHS funding.

Justin Sullivan | Getty ImagesIntel, which now counts the U.S. government as its largest shareholder, said on Tuesday that it will match the Trump administration's $1,000 payout for children of eligible U.S. employees.The matching funds, which is a benefit for Intel staff, mark the latest sign of a close working relationship between the Trump administration and Intel after the government took a 10% stake in the chipmaker last year through an $8.9 billion investment. The 530A program, often called \"Trump Accounts,\" passed as part of the administration's \"big beautiful bill,\" and is intended to jumpstart wealth-building opportunities for children, allowing their investments to grow and compound for years before they become adults.\"America's future technologists will define the next era of innovation, and the Trump Accounts program helps give them an early financial foundation,\" Lip-Bu Tan, Intel CEO, said in Tuesday's statement. Intel is joining a list of other companies that say they will match the federal $1,000 contribution. They include SoFi, Charter Communications, BNY, BlackRock, Investment Company Institute, Robinhood and Charles Schwab.The program allows parents to open tax-advantaged investment accounts for children under 18, with kids born between 2025 and 2028 getting seed funding of $1,000 from the government. Employer contributions up to $2,500 don't count as taxable income. Parents will be able to open the accounts in July. In December, Dell founder Michael Dell said he would donate $6.25 billion to the program, to seed some Trump Accounts for children born before the Jan. 1 cutoff with $250.

    "body": "U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell holds a press conference after the Fed cut interest rates by quarter of a percentage point, in Washington, D.C., U.S., October 29, 2025. Kevin Lamarque | ReutersThis week's Federal Reserve meeting offers little suspense and probably not much action, even as massive changes loom over the central bank's longer-term direction.Judging by market expectations and policymakers' comments, there's virtually no chance the Fed will change its benchmark interest rate when the meeting ends Wednesday.Despite a recent spate of disagreements among Federal Open Market Committee members about the longer-term trajectory of monetary policy, the near-term stance likely will be one of patience as a series of cuts made last year work their way through the economy.\"Overall, the Fed just wants to stand pat. They feel they've got time to wait and see,\" former Fed Vice Chair Roger Ferguson said in a CNBC interview Monday. \"This feels like a wait-and-see meeting, and we should all be listening to see if there's any hint or a bias towards a future action.\"watch nowIndications of where the FOMC heads from here would come from the post-meeting policy statement as well as Chair Jerome Powell's news conference afterward. Markets currently expect the Fed to cut once or twice this year — most likely in June and December, according to futures market pricing gauged by the CME Group's FedWatch tool.However, the focus most certainly will lie beyond the interest rate decision and future guidance and into an unprecedented web of intrigue that surrounds the meeting.Storm around PowellFor one, President Donald Trump told CNBC last week that he may have narrowed down his search for Powell's successor to a single candidate, a nomination that could be announced this week and perhaps even timed to coincide with the Fed rate decision.\"If there is a single most likely window, it's during the January FOMC — particularly if Trump is lookingto redirect attention away from a Fed that didn't cut,\" Stephanie Roth, chief economist at Wolfe Research, said in a note. \"More broadly, the decision could come as soon as this week, or within the next couple of weeks.\"Also operating in the background: The Justice Department has served Powell with a subpoena seeking information on the Fed's massive renovation project on its Washington, D.C., headquarters. In an unusually candid videotaped statement, Powell called the probe a \"pretext\" for Trump's desire to bully the Fed into cutting rates even more aggressively than it has in recent months.There's uncertainty elsewhere, too, with Trump's effort to unseat Fed Governor Lisa Cook over mortgage fraud allegations in front of the U.S. Supreme Court last week, and Trump appointee Stephen Miran's term expiring Saturday. Fed governors can serve until they are replaced, so it's not clear how much longer Miran will stay on the board. He dissented from each of last year's three, quarter percentage point rate cuts, favoring even larger moves.So while the market will pay close attention to interest rate developments and indications, much of the scrutiny will go toward the ancillary events that have rocked the central bank.Political pressures\"While the Fed has been politically pressured to cut rates, it is not pressed by the data,\" wrote Gregory Daco, chief economist at EY-Parthenon. However, Powell \"is likely to refrain from commenting directly on the Department of Justice probe involving himself and the Fed, as well as the Supreme Court's pending ruling related to Governor Cook.\"That won't stop media members from asking, though.\"Powell will be asked about his video warning that Trump DoJ subpoenas and other actions seekto subject monetary policy to the 'preferences of the president,'\" Krishna Guha, head of global policy and central bank strategy at Evercore ISI, said in a note. \"We think he will stand by everything he said and express faith in the Supreme Court as the final arbiter of Fed independence.\"Absent further political developments, that will bring the focus back to policy.Markets will look to decipher whether the hold this month is hawkish, the precursor of an extended period of no cuts, or dovish, in which Powell and the committee indicate that more cuts are likely, just not now.Morgan Stanley's chief economist, Michael Gapen, expects to see a tilt toward dovish.\"We think recent stabilization in the labor market and solid activity data will be the main drivers behind the decision to pause rate cuts, while incoming data on inflation will keep the Fed confident enough about disinflation later this year to retain an easing bias,\" Gapen said in a note. \"We do not believe committee members are ready to signal an end to the cutting cycle.\"Gapen is also looking for several changes in the post-meeting statement, likely reflecting an upgrade to economic growth and a removal of language on increased downside risks to employment.

Both officials are Democrats who for weeks have been strongly critical of the Trump administration's surge of immigration enforcement officers to Minneapolis and elsewhere.On Monday, multiple news outlets reported that Greg Bovino, the Border Patrol commander at large, was leaving Minneapolis, where his comments on Pretti's death and other immigration-enforcement related issues had inflamed tensions.Bovino had claimed that Pretti, who had a licensed handgun on his person at the time of the confrontation with federal agents, may have intended to \"massacre law enforcement.\"Noem and Bovino's claims have been undercut by videos taken of Pretti's shooting, which shows him on the ground when he is apparently shot from behind by an agent.During an interview with Fox News' Will Cain on Tuesday, Trump was asked if Homan's arrival and Bovino's departure were a \"pullback.\"\"I don't think it's a pullback. It's a little bit of a change,\" Trump said. \"Everybody in this room that has a business, you know, you make little changes.

    "body": "CEO and Co-Founder of Anthropic Dario Amodei speaks during the 56th annual World Economic Forum (WEF) meeting in Davos, Switzerland, January 20, 2026. Denis Balibouse | ReutersAnthropic has closed its latest funding round above the initial $10 billion target at a $350 billion valuation, CNBC confirmed on Tuesday.The round closed at a total between $10 billion and $15 billion, according to three sources familiar with the discussions who asked not to be named because the details are confidential. But that figure could still grow if Microsoft and Nvidia decide to contribute, the people said. In November, Microsoft and Nvidia announced plans to invest up to $5 billion and up to $10 billion into the artificial intelligence startup, respectively. It's not clear if they plan to participate in Anthropic's latest round, or how much they might commit, the people said. Coatue and Singapore sovereign wealth fund GIC are leading the financing, as CNBC previously reported. Sequoia Capital, which is an investor in Anthropic's rival OpenAI, is also participating, according to the people. The Financial Times was first to report Anthropic's oversubscribed funding round. Anthropic was founded in 2021 by former OpenAI research executives, including its CEO, Dario Amodei. The company is best known for developing a family of large language models called Claude, and its AI coding tool Claude Code has exploded in popularity in recent months. Amodei told CNBC earlier this month that Anthropic generated close to $10 billion in revenue last year.WATCH: Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei on AI race: Focused on making our models as smart and capable as possiblewatch nowRead more CNBC tech newsApple, Google host dozens of AI 'nudify' apps like Grok, report findsBlockbuster social media trial kicks off, with more to come this yearMeta inks deal to pay Corning up to $6 billion for fiber-optic cables in AI data centersTikTok blames data center outages for U.S. app problems, denies censorship claims",

Those claims were later contradicted by video evidence and analyses from multiple news outlets. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., cited Noem's statements about Pretti on the Senate floor on Tuesday and joined calls for Trump to fire Noem.\"Kristi Noem is a liar, she's vicious. She's also incompetent. Donald Trump must fire her at once before another American is killed under her watch,\" Schumer said.Trump on Tuesday said \"no\" when a reporter at the White House asked him if Noem would leave her post.Noem is doing \"a very good job,\" Trump told reporters before a planned trip to Iowa.Homeland Security spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin said in an emailed statement that, \"DHS enforces the laws Congress passes, period. If certain members don't like those laws, changing them is literally their job.\"\"While ICE officers are facing a staggering 1,300% spike in assaults, too many politicians would rather defend criminals and attack the men and women who are enforcing our laws and did nothing while Joe Biden facilitated an invasion of tens of millions of illegal aliens into our country. It's time they focus on protecting the American people, the work this Department is doing every day under Secretary Noem's leadership,\" McLaughlin's statement continues.The warning by House Democrats comes as a partial government shutdown looms amid concerns over DHS funding.\"Taxpayer dollars are being weaponized by the Trump administration to kill American citizens, brutalize communities and violently target law-abiding immigrant families. The country is disgusted by what the Department of Homeland Security has done,\" the leaders said in their statement.The House last week passed a more than $1.2 trillion spending package that included funding for DHS and other agencies. But the Senate has only until 12:01 a.m. Saturday to pass the bills and keep the government fully funded.The killing of Pretti, a 37-year-old intensive care nurse, has prompted outrage among Senate Democrats, who have called for the DHS bill to be stripped from the larger spending package in exchange for their votes.Democratic support for the spending bills is needed to clear the 60-vote filibuster in the Senate.\"Senate Democrats have made clear we are ready to quickly advance the five appropriations bills separately from the DHS funding bill before the January 30th deadline,\" Schumer said in a statement Monday. \"The responsibility to prevent a partial government shutdown is on Leader Thune and Senate Republicans,\" Schumer said. \"If [Majority  Leader John] Thune puts those five bills on the floor this week, we can pass them right away. If not, Republicans will again be responsible for another government shutdown.\" Trump and the White House this week softened the administration's stance on Pretti, seemingly walking back earlier statements made by administration officials like Stephen Miller, Trump's homeland security adviser, who labeled Pretti a \"domestic terrorist.\"\"Nobody in the White House, including President Trump, wants to see people getting hurt or killed in America's streets,\" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said during a press briefing on Monday.Still, tensions remain high after the deaths of Pretti and Renee Nicole Good, another citizen killed by federal agents in Minneapolis this month.DHS recently launched an immigration enforcement investigation in Minnesota, sending federal agents to the state in response to an ongoing social services fraud scandal and targeting thousands of refugees.Minnesota state officials and congressional Democrats have sharply condemned the tactics used by DHS and ICE, and some congressional Republicans have also called for increased oversight.Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., on Monday called on the heads of ICE, Customs and Border Protection and U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services to testify before the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, which he chairs.He also called for an \"independent investigation\" into the shooting.\"Local police routinely, put officers involved in deadly shootings on administrative leave until an independent investigation is concluded. That should happen immediately. I can't recall ever hearing a police chief immediately describing the victim as a 'domestic terrorist' or a 'would-be assassin,'\" Paul said in a post to X on Tuesday.   \"For calm to be restored, an independent investigation is the least that should be done,\" he wrote.ICE, CPB, and USCIS officials agreed Tuesday to testify at a House Homeland Security Committee hearing on Feb. 10.",

    "body": "watch nowStock Chart IconStock chart iconHumana shares in the past dayThe proposal entails a net average payment increase of 0.09% for Medicare Advantage plans in 2027, according to a release from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, on Monday. That number is significantly less than Wall Street analysts' expectations that the agency would propose a rate increase of between 4% and 6% for next year. CMS typically finalizes Medicare Advantage rates in early April. If the current proposal holds, the rate increase would result in more than $700 million more in payments to Medicare Advantage plans in 2027, according to the agency's release. The closely watched government payment rate determines how much insurers can charge for monthly premiums and plan benefits they offer, and ultimately, their profits. The Wall Street Journal first reported about the government's rate proposal on Monday. Medicare Advantage is a privately run health insurance plan contracted by Medicare. More than half of Medicare beneficiaries are enrolled in such plans, enticed by lower monthly premiums and extra benefits not covered by traditional Medicare, according to health policy research firm KFF.CMS said it is also looking to slash a moneymaking industry billing practice. Part of the proposal aims to improve payment accuracy and ensure Medicare insurers get adequately reimbursed, the Journal reported. \"These proposed payment policies are about making sure Medicare Advantage works better for the people it serves,\" said CMS Administrator Dr. Mehmet Oz in the release. \"By strengthening payment accuracy and modernizing risk adjustment, CMS is helping ensure beneficiaries continue to have affordable plan choices and reliable benefits, while protecting taxpayers from unnecessary spending that is not oriented towards addressing real health needs.\" ",

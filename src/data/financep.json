    "body": "Christopher Waller, governor of the US Federal Reserve, speaks during the C. Peter McColough Series on International Economics at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York, US, on Thursday, Oct. 16, 2025. Michael Nagle | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesFederal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller had a \"strong interview\" for the central bank chair position with President Donald Trump in which the two discussed the labor market in depth and how to jump-start job creation, according to senior administration officials.The interview took place in the president's residence and concluded shortly before Trump addressed the nation on the economy Wednesday night. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, chief of staff Susie Wiles and deputy chief of staff Dan Scavino also attended the interview.Blackrock's Rick Rieder will be interviewed at Mar-a-Lago for the Fed chair job the last week of the year, the officials said. Fed Governor Michelle Bowman is no longer a candidate for the job, they also said.National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett, the favorite for the job in prediction markets, and former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh have previously been interviewed by Trump.The officials said the conversation about jobs with Waller showed concern and criticism was misplaced that the president was seeking a candidate based on the criteria that the next Fed chair would bow to the whims of Trump on rates. They said the president's interest in the interviews with candidates had been broad-based across a series of economic issues.Last week, Trump told The Wall Street Journal he thought the Fed chair should consult with him on rates. \"It doesn't mean—I don't think he should do exactly what we say,\" the president said. \"But certainly we're—I'm a smart voice and should be listened to.\"In the Oval Office on Thursday, Trump praised Waller in response to a reporter's question. \"I think he's great. I mean, he's been a man who has been there a long time, somebody that I was very involved with.\" Trump interviewed Waller in 2019 and nominated him to be a Fed governor.Despite the praise of Waller and the positive description of the interview, there was no indication that he was a favorite candidate for the job. It was only clear that the process of interviews continues with the obvious implication that the president had yet to make a decision. The officials said the interviews are following a \"highly organized process.\"In his speech Wednesday, Trump said, \"I will soon announce our next chairman of the Federal Reserve, someone who believes in lower interest rates by a lot, and mortgage payments will be coming down even further.\"Waller's weightliftingIn an interview on Wednesday with CNBC at the Yale CEO Summit in New York, which took place before he met with the president, Waller said he believed rates could decline by 50 to 100 basis points below the current level because he expects inflation to drop and was concerned about the weak job market.Waller dissented in July when the Fed kept rates on hold, a move that seemed prescient with the Fed then starting cuts in September and taking rates down another two times before year-end.No details were provided of what the two men discussed about jobs, but the conversation suggests Trump could be more focused on the issue. The recent November jobs report showed a rise in the unemployment rate to 4.6% from 4.4% in September while payroll growth slowed to a crawl.In his speech Wednesday, Trump said that \"there are more people working today than at any time in American history. And 100 percent of all jobs created since I took office have been in the private sector.\"Since January, the private sector has added 687,000 jobs and the government has lost 188,000 as part of sweeping job cuts by the administration.On a lighter note, the president was said to have been seriously impressed when informed that Waller could dead lift 350 pounds.",

Elizabeth Frantz | ReutersU.S. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said she was suspending the diversity visa program at President Donald Trump's direction, saying the man suspected of killing two students at Brown University and a MIT professor had been granted one.Noem posted on X late Thursday that she had instructed the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services to pause the (DV1) program \"to ensure no more Americans are harmed by this disastrous program.\"On Dec. 13, two students died and nine others were injured when someone opened fire at the physics building at Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island. Police later identified Portuguese national Claudio Manuel Neves Valente, 48, as the suspect.Valente was a former student at the university and had been enrolled in a Ph.D. program in physics in 2000, the university's president, Christina H. Paxson, said. Valente is also suspected of having killed MIT physics professor Nuno Loureiro, 47, in his home in Brookline, Massachusetts, two days after the Brown shooting. Valente and Loureiro are believed to have attended the same university in their native Portugal.Authorities announced the suspect's identity hours after Valente was found dead in a New Hampshire storage facility on Thursday, Providence Police Chief Oscar Perez said. Guns were also found at the scene.\"There's no longer a threat to the public,\" the U.S. attorney's office in Boston said in a statement after Valente's death was confirmed. Authorities believe Valente acted alone and have not disclosed a motive for the killings. Noem said that Valente entered the U.S. through the DV1 program in 2017 and was granted a green card.\"In 2017, President Trump fought to end this program, following the devastating NYC truck ramming by an ISIS terrorist, who entered under the DV1 program, and murdered eight people,\" she wrote on X.The Diversity Immigrant Visa Program (DV Program) allocates up to 50,000 immigrant visas every year, according to the USCIS website.The program is a lottery. Visas are randomly allocated to individuals from countries with low rates of immigration to the U.S.— Dan Mangan contributed to this report.",

    "body": "The Wall Street Bull statue covered in snow on Nov. 15, 2018.Erik Mcgregor | Lightrocket | Getty ImagesWall Street expected U.S. mergers and acquisitions to roar back in 2025. The reality was something closer to fits and starts.  Following the election of President Donald Trump more than a year ago, executives and bankers prepared for a looser regulatory environment and a robust pipeline for mergers and acquisitions. Instead, they were met with tariff uncertainty, high interest rates, and an unpredictable process for winning over the Trump administration and getting deal approval. While the year saw high-profile megadeals inked — Union Pacific's proposed acquisition of Norfolk Southern for $85 billion; Netflix's proposed takeover of Warner Bros. Discovery's streaming and studio assets for $72 billion; the pending take-private of Electronic Arts for roughly $50 billion — generally, U.S. deal volume was down year over year, according to Pitchbook data. \"When you read the headlines they seem to suggest there has never been a better M&A market in the history of the planet. And while that's true in some ways, when you get underneath the front page headlines and these massive transactions ... you see a less active market,\" said Benjamin Sibbett, co-head of the Americas M&A practice at Clifford Chance.Through Dec. 15 this year, there were roughly 13,900 transactions in the U.S., compared with 15,940 deals  during the same period in 2024, the last year of the Biden administration, according to Pitchbook data. Deal value, however, was up, boosted by high-dollar-figure agreements: The 2025 deals tracked by Pitchbook totaled roughly $2.4 trillion in value, compared with roughly $1.83 trillion in 2024. The data represents both corporate M&A and private equity buyout activity and considers both announced and closed transactions. In particular, middle-market deal volume was low this year with those large M&A transactions padding the stats, according to a S&P Global analysis of deal-making as of November. \"This has been a decade-high level of megadeals, double the number of deals from last year. When you look at the importance of scale, it's been an all-time record in terms of the premium that the market has given to scale,\" said Anu Aiyengar, JPMorgan's global head of advisory and M&A, on a recent JPMorgan podcast episode. Over the last 10 years, 2021 remains the biggest year on record for U.S. deal activity, a reflection of low interest rates at the time. By this point in the year in 2021, there were 19,666 deals recorded with a total valuation of roughly $5.55 trillion, according to Pitchbook. Executives, lawyers and bankers like Aiyengar note that the sluggishness in deal-making this year took place primarily in the first half of the year as Trump's rolling tariff announcements roiled the financial markets and industry leaders tried to make sense of the effects. Uncertain timesU.S. President Donald Trump delivers remarks at the White House in Washington, D.C., on April 2, 2025.Brendan Smialowski | Afp | Getty ImagesEarly in the year, consultants and bankers across sectors agreed that the Trump administration would make for smoother deal-making and a friendlier regulatory environment after a number of big consumer deals were squashed by President Joe Biden's Federal Trade Commission. Then came Trump's trade war and his so-called liberation day tariffs. Trump's April announcement of \"reciprocal tariffs\" on more than 180 countries left executives with an unclear path forward. \"Macroeconomic uncertainty\" became an often-used phrase in company updates and on investor calls as executives were hesitant to make plans or offer guidance without a clear understanding of how the future with tariffs would play out. \"We knew there was going to be some disruption with tariffs, but probably not to the extent that sort of slowed things down,\" KPMG partner and U.S. automotive leader Lenny LaRocca told CNBC of deal-making in that sector. \"With all that uncertainty around where things were going to land, I think it just put a big pause on M&A in general.\"In addition to automakers, retail and consumer companies bore the brunt of the uncertainty as they navigated whether and how to pass on undetermined higher costs to already-burdened shoppers. Overall deal value in the consumer space was 17% lower during the first three quarters of 2025 than the same period a year prior, according to an October report from Boston Consulting Group. Meanwhile transactions by deal value grew in the industrials, energy and health-care sectors, the study found. Through mid-December, there were 227 U.S. deals in the retail space, compared with 296 in the prior year period, according to Pitchbook. The combined valuation of deals, however, was more than $40 billion year to date, compared with roughly $28.4 billion at the same point in 2024, Pitchbook found. Add in the rise of artificial intelligence, which has commanded major spending by companies across the board, and still-high Federal Reserve interest rates that make borrowing more expensive, and the deal-making equation was even trickier for much of the year. \"That has felt like a bit of a roller-coaster ride,\" said Kevin Foley, JPMorgan's global head of capital markets, on its recent podcast. \"We went through that six-week pause post-liberation day ... and then after that, the level of uncertainty, at least the perception of it, started to fade. \"The sentiment became more positive, benefiting from the fact that you've got the secular tail winds of what's happening with AI investments, the anticipation of the Fed being more supportive, along with a pro-business fiscal policy out of this administration,\" Foley said. \"All of that had a very positive impact on sentiment in both the equity and debt markets.\"Last week the Fed approved its third rate cut this year, but the central bank committee's vote signaled a tougher road ahead for more reductions. While Trump continues to pressure the Fed to bring rates down further, he's also exerting his influence in other arenas and keeping industries guessing. Policy playbookAhead of Trump taking office for his second term, automotive industry insiders and onlookers believed the auto supplier industry was ripe for consolidation. The sector was coming off years of turmoil due to parts shortages and an industrywide move toward electrification.But the end of federal tax credit programs for all-electric vehicles caused many companies to reverse course on EVs and redesign their lineups yet again. Ford Motor on Monday said it would take a $19.5 billion write-down tied to changing plans on electric vehicles. That policy shift and need for automakers to adjust to tariffs and higher costs slowed transactions in the sector.There were more than 8,800 deals globally last year involving industrial manufacturing, which includes automotive, totaling $303.7 billion, according to advisory firm KPMG. The number of deals increased 3.1% from the prior year but notably fell during the fourth quarter of last year – a trend that continued into 2025.Through the third quarter of this year, deals in the automotive industry represented the largest decline by volume of KPMG's industrial manufacturing sectors, off 19.9% year over year compared with a 3.6% decline in the broader category, which also includes aerospace, transportation and logistics and other manufacturing sectors. LaRocca said he believes the broad pullback in EVs, as well as slowing industry sales and a need for diversification, will drive an uptick in deals in the coming year following this year's lull. \"If volumes aren't growing, you can't sit still, you've got to think about what other deals you can do,\" LaRocca said. \"Everybody needs to, I think, be thinking very strongly around consolidation to continue to grow.\"In media, it's a similar story. Media companies are antsy for consolidation but have faced choppy seas in trying to get deals approved by the Trump administration. Broadcast stations owner Nexstar Media Group is awaiting federal regulation changes (or substantial waivers) to complete its proposed $6.2 billion acquisition of Tegna. While Federal Communications Commission Chairman Brendan Carr has shown support for removing the decades-old rules, change has been slow to come, and Trump has more recently come out against broadcast tie-ups. Earlier in the year, Trump's crusade against diversity, equity and inclusion programs also appeared to play a role in winning regulatory approvals. Verizon ended its DEI policies to usher through FCC approval of its $20 billion acquisition of broadband provider Frontier Communications. David Ellison, chairman and chief executive officer of Paramount Skydance Corp., center, outside the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York, US, on Monday, Dec. 8, 2025.Michael Nagle | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesThe merger of Paramount Skydance closed this summer after nearly a year in limbo. In the official blessing of approval from the FCC, Carr noted that Skydance didn't have any DEI programs and had agreed not to establish any such initiatives as a new company. Paramount had previously ended its DEI politics due to Trump's executive order to ban such initiatives.The Paramount Skydance deal also notably received regulatory approval shortly after Paramount agreed to pay $16 million to Trump after he sued the company's CBS over the editing of a \"60 Minutes\" interview with former Vice President Kamala Harris. Paramount Skydance is now endeavoring another tie-up, this time with Warner Bros. Discovery. Paramount launched a hostile bid for WBD shortly after Netflix announced a deal to buy the legacy media company's streaming and studio assets after a monthslong bidding war. Paramount Skydance has argued it has a higher likelihood of receiving regulatory approval from the Trump administration than Netflix. WBD told shareholders to reject the offer this week. 'The window is open' In the second half of the year, deal activity picked up and Wall Street leaders appeared to settle into a new normal under the Trump administration. Even in the biotech and pharmaceutical industry — which spent most of the year reeling from various Trump administration policies, including tariffs and a sweeping upheaval of federal agencies under Robert F. Kennedy Jr. — there was more activity in middle-market transactions into the final months of 2025. Tim Opler, a managing director in Stifel's global health-care group, noted more buyouts of smaller biotech firms by large drugmakers. And while activity didn't reach the frenzied heights of 2021, several factors have driven a resurgence in deal-making. That includes big pharma's need to fill revenue gaps from expiring drug patents toward the end of the decade, strong company cash reserves and promising innovation.Many of the \"big uncertainties\" around geopolitical issues also \"seem to be all priced in now to a large extent,\" Arda Ural, EY's Americas life sciences leader, told CNBC.US Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr. speaks in the Oval Office during an event with President Donald Trump at the White House in Washington, DC on Nov. 6, 2025.Andrew Caballero-Reynolds | AFP | Getty ImagesPharmaceutical companies have also shown an increased interest in deals with Chinese biotechs, even as Trump and U.S. policymakers pursue protectionist policies in technology like AI and semiconductors.Pfizer, for example, struck an up to $6 billion deal with Chinese biotech 3SBio to license its cancer drug.Meanwhile, pharmaceutical companies are keen to expand in red-hot areas such as obesity, including the drugmakers that already dominate that space. Pfizer recently won a takeover war with Novo Nordisk over the obesity biotech Metsera, whose pipeline includes potential once-monthly treatments.A busier end to the year is leading many to predict a more active 2026 for M&A across the board. This is particularly true of the banking sector, which showed the most signs of life outside of megadeal activity. \"Clients began the year with cautious optimism, quickly adapting to persistent tariff, macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainties,\" said Dorothee Blessing, JPMorgan's global head of investment banking coverage on a recent podcast. \"But as the year progressed, uncertainty became more part of the business-as-usual environment.\"The number of announced deals among banks surged by 88% in the second half of this year, while the total size of transactions nearly quadrupled to $39 billion, according to Stephens banker Frank Sorrentino, who cited S&P Global Market Intelligence data.A consolidation in regional banks especially has been driven in part by the arrival of activist investors like HoldCo, who this year has taken on lenders with more than $200 billion in combined assets so far, CNBC has reported. The hedge fund pressured Comerica to find a buyer in the weeks before it agreed to sell itself to rival Fifth Third for $10.9 billion in the biggest bank merger of the year.\"There was a lot of enthusiasm at the end of last year that the regulatory environment was finally going to loosen up, and that absolutely happened,\" Sorrentino said. \"The time it takes to get a deal approval has probably been cut in half; I've never seen anything like it.\"The window for healthy deal activity could last another year or two, according to Sorrentino, who said that he expects some banks will even pull off two or three acquisitions over the next 12 months.\"Deals are getting approved at record speed, and the types of deals getting approved now would never have gotten approval under the last administration,\" he said.Investors are now wondering if big banks will announce deals of their own, either to plug holes in their product offerings, or even attempting the combination of two large institutions, said Truist analyst Brian Foran.\"The window is open,\" Foran said. \"It feels like everyone's looking at their options right now.\"— CNBC's Gabrielle Fonrouge, Michael Wayland, Annika Kim Constantino and Hugh Son contributed to this article.

    "body": "Still from Disney's \"Avatar: Fire and Ash.\"DisneyDisney and James Cameron's third Avatar movie, \"Avatar: Fire and Ash,\" hit theaters Thursday, snapping up $12 million in early preview screenings domestically.The second installment in the film series, \"The Way of Water,\" had a better start and tallied $5 million more in its Thursday preview haul in 2022. Still, box office analysts expect \"Fire and Ash\" will bring in at least $100 million during its opening weekend in the U.S. and Canada.\"A lot is riding on the performance of 'Avatar: Fire and Ash,' and with less than two weeks remaining in the year, the film's results will play a pivotal role in shaping the annual box office totals,\" Paul Dergarabedian, head of marketplace trends at Comscore, told CNBC.Fueling global ticket sales will be international markets, which collected $43.1 million in preview screenings. \"The circumstances surrounding each 'Avatar' film have been quite different,\" said Shawn Robbins, director of analytics at Fandango and founder of Box Office Theory. \"The first was a sleeper-turned-phenomenon during a pre-streaming box office heyday, the second a beneficiary of pent-up sequel demand and eventized-status in moviegoing's post-Covid recovery and the third is now opening in a more competitive and new-normal market.\"The Avatar franchise is a unicorn in Hollywood. Despite garnering widespread acclaim and massive financial success at the box office, the franchise has never quite captured the cultural relevance that \"Star Wars\" or the Marvel Cinematic Universe — both also owned by Disney — have enjoyed. Toy sales fizzled and cosplayers donning heavy blue makeup at pop culture fan conventions have become few and far between.Yet, both 2009's \"Avatar\" and 2022's \"Avatar: The Way of Water\" have topped $2 billion at the global box office, with the first film teetering close to $3 billion in total ticket receipts. \"The constant is the James Cameron factor,\" Robbins said. \"Audiences expect grand visuals, sound and storytelling when they buy tickets to his movies. They consistently meet or exceed expectations with long runways at the box office and exclusive theatrical windows because they deliver an experience that cannot be duplicated at home.\"Driving these strong hauls is the sale of premium large format tickets for screens like IMAX and Dolby, as well as 3D showings, which tend to be more expensive than regular tickets. While 3D films have fallen out of favor with domestic audiences, they remain popular internationally —especially in China. Indeed, \"Avatar\" made the bulk of its money outside of the U.S., with a whopping $2.08 billion coming from overseas.Dergarabedian said the franchise has consistently benefited from moviegoers' enthusiasm for seeing the films in 3D. \"The original 'Avatar,' released in 2009, was a groundbreaking film that reignited widespread interest in 3D cinema, setting the stage for subsequent entries to capitalize on this trend,\" he said.The international preview sales shared by Disney on Friday did not include China. The company noted that early estimates indicate an opening day of around $17.1 million, which would mark the third-highest opening day for a Motion Picture Association film since \"The Way of Water.\" \"While 'Fire and Ash' is looking at a diminished box office opening relative to 'The Way of Water,' it's all about the long game,\" Robbins said. \"Premium screens are locked up into the new year, Cameron's films are not front-loaded like most Hollywood franchises, and international performance will again far outweigh domestic.\"",

    "body": "Nurphoto | Getty ImagesPresident Donald Trump's new \"Gold Card\" visa program uses a novel definition of wealth as a job skill to allow the overseas wealthy to bypass immigration rules and secure citizenship, according to immigration attorneys.Trump last week announced the start of applications for the \"Trump Gold Card,\" a new investment visa for foreign nationals. In exchange for $1 million and a $15,000 processing fee, \"Gold Card\" applicants will get full-time residency in the U.S. in \"record time,\" according to the program's website. The website also offers a \"Corporate Gold Card,\" allowing companies to pay $2 million to secure a \"Gold Card\" for an employee, and a \"Platinum Card,\" which offers special tax benefits and may eventually be offered for $5 million. Only Congress can set immigration policy, meaning the president doesn't have the power to create or destroy a visa program. So to create the \"Gold Card,\" Trump is effectively adding a new fee model to two existing programs – known as EB-1 and EB-2 – experts explained to CNBC.The EB-1 and EB-2 programs are both employment-based programs aimed at attracting award-winning or celebrated professionals. The EB-1 program, nicknamed the \"Einstein Visa,\" is aimed at those with   \"extraordinary abilities\" – such as scientists, artists, entrepreneurs,  athletes and professors who have achieved \"sustained international or national acclaim.\"The EB-2 is for researchers, scientists and others whose skills are useful to help solve national problems, like a leading cancer researcher developing new treatments, or a top energy scientist who can help expand the power grid. White House officials say that the $1 million payment is proof that \"Gold Card\" holders are successful business people who meet the requirements for exceptional abilities. Anyone with $1 million to spend on a visa is likely to be a productive addition to the American economy and society, they say. Entrepreneurs who started companies overseas can come to the U.S. to expand or start new ventures, creating more jobs. Spending by the \"Gold Card\" wealthy is also expected to help real estate, the service economy and other industries.\"Why shouldn't we expedite the people who are willing to step up, to give the United States $1 million,\" Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told CNBC last week. \"Let's bring in the top of the top, the best. Why should we take people who are below average?\"Immigration attorneys, however, say that replacing highly skilled or celebrated talents with foreign nationals whose sole qualification is writing a $1 million check distorts the intent of the EB-1 and EB-2 programs. Not everyone with $1 million payment is a high-achieving businessperson or entrepreneur, they say. Some may have borrowed the money from friends, family or a lender. Others may have inherited their fortunes but have scant job skills.\"Having $1 million has nothing to do with your value as a person of extraordinary ability,\" said Emily Neumann, an immigration attorney with Reddy Neumann Brown PC. \"It doesn't mean you are able to provide value to the United States of America. These categories were supposed to be reserved for people who can foster innovation and contribute to the economy and create jobs. There is no requirement that \"Gold Card\" holders have a track record of any of those things, just because they happen to have $1 million.\" While \"Gold Card\" applicants can't legally skip the current waiting line for EB-1 and EB-2 holders, some attorneys fear the White House will give \"Gold Card\" applicants priority. Neumann said she has an Indian client who's a leading expert in artificial intelligence and machine learning and is working on AI applications for doctors to better diagnose patients. He's approved for the EB-1 but is still waiting on a green card, which could take years.\"They're using up a limited number of green cards meant for people who have done wonderful things,\" she said. \"It's a very different standard.\"Using the EB-1 and EB-2 programs for the \"Gold Card\" program has created other potential hurdles. While Trump has said he would sell \"millions\" of \"Gold Cards,\" and Lutnick said sales could raise $1 trillion in revenue, the two programs are capped at around 28,000 a year. Individual countries are capped at 7% of the total, which is why the the waiting list for E-1 and E-2 applications  from India and China already extends for several years. Immigration attorneys say India and China would be largest sources of demand for \"Gold Cards.\" Yet because of the waiting lists, few are likely to apply.\"If 'Gold Card' holders will be allowed to jump the queue, there will likely be lawsuits from those currently on the wait list,\" said Reaz Jafri, an immigration attorney with the international law firm Withers. \"And if not, who will want to pay the $1 million and then wait for three years?\"The unanswered questions and legal risks surrounding the \"Gold Card\" have caused potential buyers to hold off on applying, attorneys say. Dominic Volek, group head of private clients at Henley & Partners, said a number of his clients in Taiwan, Vietnam and Singapore are interested in the \"Gold Card\" but are waiting for proof that the program works.Some are also worried about paying the $1 million and then having their visas overturned by a court or a future Democratic administration.\"They want to see the dust settle and see if there are any major legal challenges,\" Volek said.Another concern is the structure of the fee. While some national investment visas are more expensive – such as Singapore's at nearly $8 million or New Zealand's at nearly $3 million – they're structured as investments rather than non-refundable payments. Without an explicit guarantee of a green card, the overseas wealthy are reluctant to pay the $1 million.\"It's not clear if you make the payment once it's approved or you provide the payment as evidence, or if it's kept in escrow during the process,\" Jafri said. \"They haven't addressed so many basic questions.\"Proof of funds is proving to be another hurdle for the overseas wealthy. In order to screen for money laundering or criminal activity, the U.S. government typically requires proof that the $1 million fee didn't come from illegal or illicit sources. Many potential applicants from Asia, Africa and the Middle East are already balking at the demands, since financial documentation is not as thorough.\"The biggest sticking point for a lot of clients is being able to document the source of money,\" Jafri said. \"In certain parts of the world it's not so easy to document.\"",

Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, a day after its board announced it would rename the institution in Washington, Dec. 19, 2025.Kevin Lamarque | ReutersPresident Donald Trump's name was added to the facade of the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts on Friday, a day after the center's board voted to rename that Washington institution the \"Trump-Kennedy Center.\" Workers affixed Trump's name to the building, above the center's original name.The center's website had already been updated on Thursday to say it is now \"The Trump Kennedy Center.\"\"Our Chairman, President Donald J. Trump, has not only saved this historic building but also created a truly bipartisan place to celebrate the arts,\" the center said in a statement Friday.Trump took effective control of the Kennedy Center in February, naming himself its chair and appointing the board of trustees, which voted for the new name on Thursday.White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said Thursday that the board \"voted unanimously\" for the name change. But Rep. Joyce Beatty, an Ohio Democrat who is an ex officio member of the board, disputed Leavitt's claim.\"As I tried to push my button to voice my concern, to ask questions and certainly not to vote in support of this, I was muted,\" Beatty said in a post to X. \"Yet it was said at the end it was a unanimous vote.\"Other board members also said they were muted during the vote, and that they would have voted against the name change.The law establishing the center in the 1960s says its name cannot be changed.And the law says \"no additional memorials or plaques in the nature of memorials shall be designated or installed in the public areas of the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts.\"Sen. Andy Kim, D-N.J., said in a social media post that work on the building \"needs to stop as it's illegal to change without Congress.\"Missouri Republican Rep. Robert Onder in July proposed a bill to change the Kennedy Center's name to that of Trump's. The bill has no cosponsors. Kennedy family members were outraged by the center's name change.\"It is beyond comprehension that this sitting president has sought to rename this great memorial dedicated to President Kennedy,\" said Maria Shriver, who is a niece of the late president. \"It is beyond wild that he would think adding his name in front of President Kennedy's name is acceptable.\"Kennedy's grandson, Jack Schlossberg, suggested that the renaming was spurred by his decision to run for a House seat from New York.\"Trump explicitly motivated to act by JACK FOR NEW YORK,\" he said in a social media post. \"Our campaign represents everything Trump can't stand or defeat.\"CNBC requested comment from Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. for comment. He is the nephew of the late president.",

    "body": "President Donald Trump's social media company will provide the capital needed to bring TAE Technologies' first fusion power plant online in the United States by 2031, TAE CEO Michl Binderbauer told CNBC on Thursday.Binderbauer spoke shortly after his privately held company and Trump Media and Technology Group announced plans for an all-stock merger valued at more than $6 billion.The CEO said the deal would combine Trump Media's \"fortress balance sheet\" with TAE's technologies.\"We've got capability and technology to really scale this,\" Binderbauer told CNBC.\"We've got the engineering prowess to do that, but the last piece of the puzzle was the capital,\" he said. \"Now, you're marrying capital with that underlying base of technical capability.\"Fusion is a form of nuclear power that could one day generate enormous amounts of energy by fusing atoms. The process, which powers the Sun, does not produce the long-life radioactive waste that is the byproduct of fission, the process created in traditional nuclear reactors. Despite decades of research, scientists and companies have so far been unable to commercialize fusion technology. Fusion ignition was only achieved for the first time in a laboratory setting in December 2022. But Binderbauer said he is bullish on his company's prospects to reliably generate — and sell — fusion power, now that it can tap funding from Trump Media.Trump Media, which operates the Truth Social app, will invest up to $200 million in TAE with another $100 million coming after filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Binderbauer said. Trump Media has meager revenue relative to its market capitalization, which was above $4 billion on Thursday, and to its balance sheet. For the third quarter that ended on Sept. 30, Trump Media had financial assets of $3.1 billion, which included cash and digital assets, the company announced last month. Trump Media for that quarter reported a net loss of $54.8 million, with sales of just under $973,000.TAE and Trump Media said that their merged company in 2026 plans, subject to regulatory approval, to \"site and begin construction on the world's first utility-scale fusion power plant,\" which would generate 50 megawatts of electrical power, an industry measurement. TAE has plans to scale up future fusion power plants to generate between 350 to 500 megawatts of power, Binderbauer said. A traditional fission nuclear power plant can generate about two to three times that much power, depending on the reactor. \"Fusion power will be the most dramatic energy breakthrough since the onset of commercial nuclear energy in the 1950s,\" Trump Media CEO Devin Nunes said on a call Thursday. \"An innovation that will lower energy prices, boost supply, ensure America's AI supremacy and revive America's manufacturing base and bolster national defense,\" Nunes said.Trump Media's investment comes as the artificial intelligence boom has left utilities scrambling to find enough power to fuel the build-out of data centers across the country. In October, the Energy Department launched a national strategy in October to accelerate the commercialization of fusion. Nunes said, \"Together with TAE, we will have the capital and public market access to scale TAE's vision to put abundant nuclear energy on the grid.\"Nunes, who is a former House member from California, and Binderbauer plan to serve as co-CEOs of the merged company.\"Nunes will continue to lead all Trump Media brand operations. Binderbauer will manage TAE Technologies,\" a news release said.TAE, whose board members include Ernest Moniz, who served as Energy secretary in the Obama administration, was founded in 1998.Since then, the company has raised more than $1.3 billion in private capital in a dozen rounds of funding, from investors such as Chevron and Alphabet's Google. Asked why TAE did not strike a deal with one of its prior investors, Binderbauer said Trump Media moved quickly and boldly.\"We have these partnerships, but this is the one that moved,\" Binderbauer said.\"I just have to reduce it to that simple sort of factor. That's really the difference,\" he said. \"We're going to build a power plant. We're going to take this technology to the commercial level.\" TAE has not yet made siting decisions or reached offtake agreements for its planned plants, Binderbauer said. \"We're in the process on that,\" he said.  \"We're going to announce that when we're ready with that, but we have a game plan.\" Michael Schwab will serve as chairman of the combined company's nine-member board. Donald Trump Jr., Nunes and Binderbauer will serve as directors. The five other members are yet to be chosen. ",

Juliet, Tennessee, on October 9, 2024.Seth Herald | Afp | Getty ImagesStarbucks announced Friday that it has hired its new chief technology officer, Amazon veteran Anand Varadarajan. Varadarajan, who spent nearly 19 years at Amazon, most recently led technology and supply chain for the tech giant's worldwide grocery stores business.Varadarajan, who also previously held software engineering roles at Oracle, will begin Jan. 19 as executive vice president and CTO, reporting directly to CEO Brian Niccol, according to a memo. The hire comes after Deb Hall Lefevre, Starbucks' former CTO, departed in September as the company underwent a second round of layoffs and announced a $1 billion restructuring plan as a part of its ongoing turnaround. \"[Varadarajan] knows how to create systems that are reliable and secure, drive operational excellence and scale solutions that keep customers at the center. Just as important, he cares deeply about supporting and developing the people behind the scenes that build and enable the technology we use,\" Niccol wrote in a memo announcing the hiring. At Amazon, Varadarajan had recently been elevated to oversee the worldwide grocery technology and supply chain organizations, which include both its homegrown Fresh brand and Whole Foods. He reported directly to Jason Buechel, Amazon's grocery chief and the CEO of Whole Foods. During his tenure, Amazon has experimented further with grocery tech innovations like a pilot to incorporate mini robotic warehouses in Whole Foods supermarkets that enable consumers to shop both its in-store selection and products from Amazon's wider inventory that aren't typically stocked by the organic grocer.Starbucks, meanwhile, is still in the early stages of a turnaround overseen by Niccol, who took over as CEO in September 2024. In the most recent quarter, Starbucks' quarterly same-store sales returned to growth for the first time in nearly two years, a sign that its strategy is winning over lapsed customers. Holiday sales have also been strong so far this season as the company contends with an ongoing strike of unionized baristas impacting a small number of its stores.Part of that strategy is its hospitality platform, Green Apron Service, which at $500 million is the company's largest investment into labor. The program is backed by changes to ensure proper staffing and better technology to keep service times fast. It was born out of growth in digital orders — which now make up more than 30% of sales — and feedback from baristas.watch now— CNBC's Annie Palmer contributed to this report",

    "body": "UnitedHealthcare sign is displayed at its office building in Minnetonka, Minnesota, U.S., Dec. 11, 2025. Tim Evans | ReutersUnitedHealth Group on Friday released the first results from a sprawling independent audit of its business practices and committed to a wide range of steps to track and implement improvements in three specific areas. The health-care giant said it has adopted 23 ongoing \"action plans\" to put in place and monitor recommended improvements, with oversight by its internal audit and advisory services team. Around 65% of those actions will be complete by the end of 2025, while 100% of those plans will be finished by the end of March next year. The results come as private insurers try to rebuild trust with the American public after fierce, pent-up backlash over their practices and the broader U.S. health-care system. Critics say insurer business tactics have made it harder for some patients to access and pay for care. The company owns UnitedHealthcare, the nation's largest and most powerful insurer. While the announcement on Friday is a step toward improving the business, it's unclear how much it will change the public's view on the company and the broader industry.UnitedHealth in July announced that two independent consultancies had launched a third-party review of its business policies and performance metrics. That same day, UnitedHealth also confirmed that it is facing Department of Justice investigations over its Medicare billing practices. The independent audit marked one of Steve Hemsley's earliest steps as CEO after he took the reins in May, following the abrupt departure of Andrew Witty.\"We hope that you see these assessments as a commitment to setting a new standard of transparency for the health care marketplace, as we believe that you and every person who engages with our health system deserves to understand how we go about our work,\" Hemsley said in a letter Friday. \"We know that our actions and decisions have significant impacts on patients, care providers and the broader health system, and we are determined to hold ourselves to the highest standard,\" he added. FTI Consulting reviewed UnitedHealthcare's approaches to risk assessment operations within its Medicare Advantage programs, which refers to how the company rates the health status of members in those privately run plans. The firm also examined the company's care services management policies, procedures and processes. Consulting firm the Analysis Group also assessed the policies and processes of Optum Rx – the company's pharmacy benefit manager, or PBM  – for ensuring prescription discounts from drug manufacturers are \"accurately collected and distributed to clients.\" PBMs are middlemen who negotiate rebates with drug manufacturers on behalf of insurers, create lists of medications covered by insurance and reimburse pharmacies for prescriptions.Hemsley said the firms determined that the company's policies and practices are \"robust, rigorous and generally sound; and, in many respects, industry leading.\" But he noted that they also provided recommendations for improvements. For example, a review by the Analysis Group found that OptumRx has \"implemented a comprehensive and well-structured framework that governs all stages of manufacturer discount administration.\" More CNBC health coverageThe Trump administration is changing Covid, childhood vaccine recommendations – here's what it means for youU.S. to impose 100% tariff on branded, patented drugs unless firms build plants locally, Trump saysEli Lilly to build $6.5 billion Texas manufacturing facility for obesity pill, other drugsThe assessment identified at least 25 distinct \"controls\" in place that collectively lower the risk of miscalculating or delaying the distribution of discounts owed to clients and collecting incomplete discounts from drugmakers, said Aaron Yeater, managing principal at the Boston office of Analysis Group, in a document Friday. The review found \"no deficiencies or need for corrective measures\" but recommended ways to enhance Optum Rx's practices. That includes strengthening Optum Rx's escalation processes for resolving nonpayment and dispute cases through communication with manufacturers. Among UnitedHealth's action plans is to develop a formal policy that supports procedures for addressing those cases. Yeater noted that he examined the business processes and not the legal and regulatory issues the company is facing with its PBM. Meanwhile, FTI Consulting found that UnitedHealth scored better than its peers by several measures when it came to Medicaid and Medicare. But the firm pointed to slow decision-making on authorizations, documentation issues and the need to better address the findings raised in regulatory audits. Beyond these first results, UnitedHealth said it will share the findings from a review of medical records of diagnosis codes during the first quarter. The company will also report on its processes to craft what it calls \"evidence-based medical policy\" by the middle of the year. Shares of UnitedHealth Group are down more than 35% for the year after it suspended its 2025 forecast amid skyrocketing medical costs, announced the surprise exit of Witty and grappled with the probes into its Medicare Advantage business. It followed a difficult 2024 marked by a historic cyberattack and public blowback after the murder of UnitedHealthcare's CEO, Brian Thompson.Correction: UnitedHealth Group had a difficult 2024. An earlier version misstated the year. ",

    "body": "U.S. financier Jeffrey Epstein appears in a photograph taken for the New York State Division of Criminal Justice Services' sex offender registry March 28, 2017 and obtained by Reuters July 10, 2019.New York State Division of Criminal Justice Services | Handout | ReutersThe Department of Justice on Friday released some — but not all — of its investigative files about Jeffrey Epstein, the notorious sex predator.The release came on the deadline set by the recently signed Epstein Files Transparency Act for the DOJ to release all of the files.Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., who led the effort that forced a vote on the bill that became that law, said that the DOJ's production of the files \"grossly fails to comply with both the spirit and the letter of the law.\"The DOJ's website features a new page titled \"Epstein Library,\" which has a search box to look for keywords in the newly released files.The material included hundreds of photographs, some of which featured Epstein and his former girlfriend and convicted accomplice, Ghislaine Maxwell, as well as images that appeared to show parts of his home and other locations. Epstein died in a jailhouse suicide in 2019. Maxwell is serving a 20-year prison term for crimes related to her procuring underage girls for him to sexually abuse.It was not immediately clear how much of the released material was not previously publicly available through other sources.The search box did not immediately appear to work, as searches for words including \"Epstein\" generated a message saying: \"No results found. Please try a different search.\"\"This site houses materials responsive under the Epstein Files Transparency Act,\" the site says. \"This site will be updated if additional documents are identified for release.\"In a letter to members of Congress detailing the partial release, Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said the material included evidence collected in a 2018 criminal probe of Epstein by the FBI; a 2019 probe of Maxwell; \"the FBI Miami investigative file for the 2006 Epstein criminal case for child prostitution; the FBI Miami, the FBI New York investigative file for the 2019 Epstein death investigation;\" as well as court records from civil and criminal cases involving Epstein, Maxwell and the Epstein estate.Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., said Friday that Congress could hold impeachment hearings about Attorney General Pam Bondi and Blanche if the released documents do not meet the law's requirements. \"What we need is a clear timeline of when the rest of the documents will be released and an explanation for why they did not release all of them today,\" Khanna said at a press conference after the DOJ posted the documents.Several photos showed former President Bill Clinton, including one featuring a smiling Clinton with a young woman wearing a white tank top perched on the arm of his chair. Her arm is draped over his shoulder, and his left hand rests near her hip.Photo from the Jeffrey Epstein files released by the U.S. Justice Department showing Bill Clinton with an unknown woman. Image is redacted by the U.S. Justice Department. Date and context unclear.Department of Justice.Another photo shows what appears to be shirtless Clinton sitting in a hot tub, his hands clasped behind his head. A third photo features Clinton and Epstein wearing shiny dress shirts.It was not clear when any of the photos were taken or their locations. CNBC did not alter the photos.Clinton has not been accused of wrongdoing in connection with Epstein.His spokesman, Angel Urena, more than six years ago said, \"President Clinton knows nothing about the terrible crimes Jeffrey Epstein pleaded guilty to in Florida some years ago, or those with which he has been recently charged in New York.\"On Friday, Urena responded to the files being released with a post on X.\"The White House hasn't been hiding these files for months only to dump them late on a Friday to protect Bill Clinton,\" Urena wrote. \"This is about shielding themselves from what comes next, or from what they'll try and hide forever. So they can release as many grainy 20-plus-year-old photos as they want but this isn't about Bill Clinton.\"\"There are two types of people here. The first group knew nothing and cut Epstein off before his crimes came to light,\" Urena said. \" The second group continued relationships with him after. We're in the first. No amount of stalling by people in the second group will change that. Everyone, especially MAGA, expects answers, not scapegoats.\"In a 1997 photo, Jeffrey Epstein, left, and Donald Trump pose together at the Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Florida.Davidoff Studios Photography | Archive Photos | Getty ImagesAmong the documents released Friday was an address book, which included a listing for President Donald Trump, who had been a friend of Epstein's for years before they had falling out in the early 2000s. The address book appears to be identical or substantially similar to an address book of Epstein's that was previously made public.Trump has not been accused of wrongdoing in connection with Epstein and has denied being aware of Epstein's serial sexual abuse of underage girls and women.The released files were notably light on images showing Trump, in contrast to the multiple images of Clinton. Trump is seen in images recently released by congressional Democrats after they were obtained from Epstein's estate.One photo that was released by the DOJ on Friday shows an array of photos and other items. Trump's face can be seen in an image that is among those photos.Photo from the Jeffrey Epstein files released by the U.S. Justice Department showsU.S. Department of JusticeBlanche, the deputy attorney general, earlier Friday told Fox News, \"I expect that we're going to release several hundred thousand documents today.\"\"I expect that we're going to release more documents over the next couple of weeks, so today several hundred thousand, and then over the next couple weeks,\" Blanche said. \"I expect several hundred thousand more.\"Blanche said the DOJ was reviewing each file to redact names and identities of Epstein's victims.Photo from the Jeffrey Epstein files released by the U.S. Justice Department showing Bill Clinton and Jeffrey Epstein. Date and context is unclear.U.S. Department of Justice\"There's a lot of eyes looking at these, and we want to make sure that when we do produce the materials that we're producing, that we're protecting every single victim,\" he said.White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson, in a statement, said, \"The Trump Administration is the most transparent in history.\"\"By releasing thousands of pages of documents, cooperating with the House Oversight Committee's subpoena request, and President Trump recently calling for further investigations into Epstein's Democrat friends, the Trump Administration has done more for the victims than Democrats ever have.\"\"And while President Trump is delivering on his promises, Democrats like Hakeem Jeffries and Stacey Plaskett have yet to explain why they were soliciting money and meetings from Epstein after he was a convicted sex offender,\" Jackson said. \"The American people deserve answers.\"Photo from the Jeffrey Epstein files released by the U.S. Justice Department shows Bill Clinton in a hot tub with an unknown person. Image redacted by the U.S. Justice Department. Date and context is unclear.U.S. Department of JusticeDemocrats in Congress slammed the partial release plan and Trump.\"Donald Trump and the Department of Justice are now violating federal law,\" Rep. Robert Garcia and Jamie Raskin said in a joint statement. \"We are now examining all legal options in the face of this violation of federal law.\"Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer blasted the DOJ, Blanche, and Attorney General Pam Bondi after the interview, saying, \"This is nothing more than a cover up to protect Donald Trump from his ugly past.\"\"The law Congress passed and President Trump signed was clear as can be — the Trump administration had 30 days to release ALL the Epstein files, not just some,\" Schumer said in a statement.\"Failing to do so is breaking the law. This just shows the Department of Justice, Donald Trump, and Pam Bondi are hellbent on hiding the truth,\" he said.The text of the Epstein Files law says: \"Not later than 30 days after the date of enactment of this Act, the Attorney General shall, subject to subsection (b), make publicly available in a searchable and downloadable format all unclassified records, documents, communications, and investigative materials in the possession of the Department of Justice, including the Federal Bureau of Investigation and United States Attorneys' Offices, that relate to: (1) Jeffrey Epstein including all investigations, prosecutions, or custodial matters. (2) Ghislaine Maxwell.\"CNBC is reaching out to the people identified in the photos or mentioned in the latest release of the Epstein files. This article will be updated with their responses.A person being mentioned in the release of documents and photos does not imply any wrongdoing.Blanche is the second-highest-ranking DOJ official, after Bondi. Blanche previously served as a criminal defense lawyer for Trump.Garcia, D-Calif., and the Maryland Democrat Raskin, in their joint statement, said, \"For months, Pam Bondi has denied survivors the transparency and accountability they have demanded and deserve and has defied the Oversight Committee's subpoena.\"\"The Department of Justice is now making clear it intends to defy Congress itself, even as it gives star treatment to Epstein's convicted co-conspirator, Ghislaine Maxwell,\" they said, referring to the fact that Maxwell was transferred to a less restrictive federal prison earlier this year after sitting for a two-day interview with Blanche.The files' ordered release comes after months of controversy over the Trump administration's decision to renege on past promises by top law enforcement officials to make the documents and other evidence public.In November, Congress overwhelmingly voted to compel the DOJ to release the Epstein files, and Trump signed that legislation despite having urged Republicans in Congress to oppose it.Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche speaks during a press conference with President Donald Trump in the Oval Office of the White House, in Washington, DC, October 15, 2025. Andrew Caballero-Reynolds | Afp | Getty ImagesTrump, who had been friends with Epstein for years before the two men had a falling out in the early 2000s, had called demands to release the files a Democratic \"hoax.\"But some of the leading voices in favor of making the documents public were his fellow Republicans. Trump has never been accused of wrongdoing in connection with Epstein and has denied having been aware of Epstein's serial sexual abuse of underage girls and young women over the years.The files set to be released are related to federal investigations of Epstein over many years.The first of those probes ended in 2008, when he agreed to plead guilty to state charges in Florida related to prostitution of a person under age 18. The deal allowed him to avoid harsher federal charges. He was sentenced to 18 months in jail.Read more CNBC politics coverageEuropean Union approves over $105 billion toward Ukraine aid package for next two yearsBrown and MIT prof shooter suspect Neves Valente is found dead, authorities saysTrump Media to merge with fusion company TAE Technologies, DJT stock soarsTrump announces 'warrior dividend' of $1,776 to U.S. soldiers in prime-time speechEpstein accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell petitions to vacate sex crime convictionCongressional stock trading ban bill to get a vote in new year: House RepublicansFBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino is stepping down in JanuaryObamacare subsidies extension to get vote after 4 Republicans buck leadershipFCC chief Carr tells Senate that his agency is 'not formally ... independent'Trump vowed to block tankers carrying Venezuela's oil — nearly a dozen at sea nowKennedy Center to be renamed 'Trump-Kennedy Center,' White House saysTrump vowed to block tankers carrying Venezuela's oil — nearly a dozen at sea nowHouse passes bill to ease permits for building out AI infrastructureTrump sues BBC for $10 billion, claims defamation from Panorama documentaryPentagon takes big stake in new Korea Zinc refinery in Tenn., gets 10% of companyNew Trump tariffs collection hits $200 billion, Customs saysFormer Instacart employee says she was fired over her Democratic congressional campaignUkraine peace talks progressing, Russia open to EU membership, U.S. officials sayNew York AG sues UPS for allegedly shorting Christmas season workers' wagesTrump admin to hire 1,000 specialists for 'Tech Force'Trump doubles down on Rob Reiner criticism after killing; director's son in custodyTSA is giving airline passenger data to ICE for deportation push: NYTTrump's AI order may be 'illegal,' Democrats and consumer advocacy groups claimTrump sued by preservation group seeking to halt White House ballroom projectTrump says 'no big deal' after new Epstein photos showing him releasedPutin can fund war for years, ex-official says as Trump's resolve is testedIndiana redistricting bill that Trump demanded defeated in state SenateHouse passes INVEST Act to ease investment standards, boost capital in marketsDOJ fails again to indict New York AG James, a Trump target: ReportsTrump 'sells out' U.S. national security with Nvidia chip sales to China: WarrenTrump pushes for top prosecutor nominee Halligan after Comey, James cases tossedTrump willing to seize more oil tankers off Venezuela coast: White HouseSeized tanker will go to U.S. port, Trump admin intends 'to seize the oil'GOP lawmakers seek Trump aid for agricultural equipment after tariff pressureTrump says Fed could have 'at least doubled' latest interest rate cut'Spoof' ship: Seized oil tanker hid location, visited Iran and VenezuelaTrump admin touts pulling 9,500 truckers off road for failing English testsSwiss government says new 15% U.S. tariff ceiling retroactive to mid-NovemberHomeland Security Dept. buying Boeing 737s for ICE deportationsTrump officials move to end student loan payment pause for millions of borrowersJudge unseals Ghislaine Maxwell grand jury materials, citing Epstein files actUkraine at 'critical moment' in war as European allies ramp up pressure on RussiaDemocrats establish AI working group as industry bolsters DC presenceEx-Trump lawyer Habba resigns as NJ U.S. attorney after disqualificationThe 66-year-old Epstein was arrested in July 2019 by federal authorities on child sex trafficking charges.He killed himself in a Manhattan jail weeks later.Epstein's former girlfriend, the British socialite Maxwell, was charged the following year with crimes related to recruiting and grooming underage girls for Epstein to sexually abuse.Maxwell was convicted at trial in 2021.The Supreme Court recently denied Maxwell's request that it hear an appeal of her conviction.

    "body": "U.S. President Donald Trump speaks during an event in the Roosevelt Room of the White House December 19, 2025 in Washington, DC. Trump delivered remarks on lowering prescription drug prices during the event. Alex Wong | Getty ImagesSeveral of the largest U.S. and European-based drugmakers inked deals with President Donald Trump on Friday to voluntarily sell their medications for less, as his administration pushes to link the nation's drug prices to cheaper ones abroad.That includes Merck, Bristol Myers Squibb, Amgen, Gilead, GSK, Sanofi, Roche's Genentech, privately-held Boehringer Ingelheim and Novartis. In exchange, the companies agreed to a three-year grace period during which their products won't face Trump's planned pharmaceutical-specific tariffs — as long as the drugmakers further invest in U.S. manufacturing. Among the most notable pledges on Friday is that Bristol Myers Squibb will offer Eliquis, its blockbuster blood thinner and top-prescribed product, for free to Medicaid.The companies make up the majority of the 17 drugmakers Trump sent letters to in July, calling on them to lower prices as part of his \"most favored nation\" policy. Trump signed an executive order in May to revive that policy, calling for prices to be increased outside of the U.S. and to \"end global freeloading.\"\"As of today, 14 out of the 17 largest pharmaceutical companies ... have now agreed to drastically lower drug prices for … the American people and the American patients,\" Trump said at an event on Friday. \"This represents the greatest victory for patient affordability in the history of American health care, by far, and every single American will benefit.\"Johnson & Johnson, AbbVie and Regeneron are the remaining companies among the largest that haven't signed drug pricing deals. But Trump noted that Johnson & Johnson \"will be here next week.\" How the drug pricing deals will workThe full terms of the deals were not immediately released, which makes it unclear how broad their impact will be.The nine drugmakers agreed to take measures to reduce U.S. drug prices, including selling their existing treatments to Medicaid patients at the lowest \"most favored nation\" prices, and guaranteeing that pricing for new medicines. Trump said the drugmakers also agreed to list their most popular drugs on his upcoming direct-to-consumer website, TrumpRx, which is launching in January. Some companies also launched new or expanded existing direct-to-consumer offerings for certain drugs. For example, Gilead said in a release that it will launch a program that will enable patients to access its hepatitis C treatment and cure, Epclusa, at a discounted price. Sanofi said it will offer discounts of nearly 70% on certain medicines to treat infections and cardiovascular and diabetic conditions on TrumpRx and other direct-to-consumer platforms. Merck said it will offer three diabetes medications, Januvia, Janumet and Janumet XR, at a roughly 70% discount to cash-paying patients through a direct-to-patient program. That program will be extended to the company's experimental daily cholesterol pill if it gets approved in the U.S., according to the company. \"I reflect on your goal of driving affordability and access to Americans, but equally, getting prices up outside the United States,\" Merck CEO Robert Davis said during the press conference. \"And we're 100% supportive of your actions.\" Meanwhile, Amgen will expand its existing direct-to-patient program to include preventative migraine medication Aimovig and autoimmune treatment Amjevita, at 60% and 80% discounted monthly prices, respectively. Earlier this year, Trump announced agreements with Eli Lilly, Novo Nordisk, Pfizer, AstraZeneca and EMD Serono to sell certain drugs directly to patients at a discount, in exchange for exemptions from his planned pharmaceutical tariffs and other benefits, such as fast-tracked reviews of new drugs. U.S. prescription drug prices on average are nearly three times higher than overseas, according to a 2024 study by Rand Corp. Prices for branded drugs were more than four times higher, the report found. Trump signed an executive order in May to revive the policy of most favored nation, calling for prices to be increased outside of the U.S. and to \"end global freeloading.\"Trade association PhRMA, which represents many major pharma companies, has said that most-favored nation pricing isn't the best way to lower drug costs for Americans and instead blamed pharmacy benefit managers for the price disparity. The U.S. is the single most important market for many drugmakers, regardless of their home country. Despite being based across the Atlantic, European pharma companies are heavily exposed to the U.S. market, with half of the 10 largest companies on the Continent generating a majority of their sales in the U.S.",

    "body": "watch nowNew York Federal Reserve President John Williams said Friday that \"technical factors\" likely distorted November's inflation data, pushing the headline reading lower than it otherwise would have been.\"There were some special factors or practical factors that really are related to the fact that they weren't able to collect data in October and not in the first half of November. And because of that, I think the data were distorted in some of the categories, and that pushed down the CPI reading, probably by a tenth or so,\" Williams said on CNBC's \"Squawk Box.\"\"It's hard to know, we'll get some when we'll get to December data, I think we'll get a better reading of how much that distortion, how big the effect was, but I do think that that was pushed down a bit by these technical factors,\" he added.The consumer price index rose at a 2.7% annualized rate last month, a delayed report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics showed. Economists polled by Dow Jones expected the CPI to have risen 3.1%.Williams said the data may have a downward bias because it was collected mainly in the second half of November, when sales were widespread, and noted there were also complications with rent and other categories. The New York Fed president said he took some comfort from categories not affected by those issues, seeing cooling price pressures in certain sectors.\"Some of the data that we're seeing is actually pretty encouraging in the sense of the CPI news. and I think it represents a continuation of the disinflationary process we've seen,\" Williams said.Because the October CPI release was canceled, Thursday's report lacked several of the standard data points typically included in a CPI report. The Bureau of Labor Statistics said it could not go back and collect October survey data, though it relied on \"nonsurvey data sources\" to construct the index. As a result, economists may be cautious about interpreting the report as clear evidence that inflation is on a sustained downward path, given the absence of an October comparison. Economists believe some some inputs to the owners' equivalent rent calculation for the canceled October month were estimated by the BLS to have zero inflation, distorting that calculation downward.",

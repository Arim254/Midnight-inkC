    "body": "Warren Buffett and Greg Abel walkthrough the Berkshire Hathaway Annual Shareholders Meeting in Omaha, Nebraska on May 3, 2025. David A. Grogen | CNBCBerkshire Hathaway shares slipped Friday as investors digested the formal end of Warren Buffett's six-decade tenure as chief executive and the start of a new era under successor Greg Abel.Class A shares fell as much as 1.4% in morning trading on Abel's first day as CEO, following Buffett's official handoff of the role and the close of one of the most storied leadership tenures in corporate history. The stock last traded 0.5% lower.The Omaha-based conglomerate ended 2025 with a gain of 10.9%, trailing the S&P 500's 16.4% advance but marking its 10th consecutive year of positive returns. Buffett, 95, remains chairman and has sought to reassure shareholders that Berkshire's future extends well beyond his tenure.\"It has a better chance, I think, of being here 100 years from now than any company I can think of,\" Buffett said in a special interview with CNBC. Abel takes over as Berkshire sits on a record $381.6 billion in cash as of the end of September, following an extended period of net equity selling. Buffett has said Abel will have final authority over capital allocation decisions.\"Greg will be the decider,\" Buffett said. I \"can't imagine how much more he can get accomplished in a week than I can in a month....I'd rather have Greg handling my money than any of the top investment advisors or any of the top CEOs in the United States.\"Berkshire shares lagged the broader market after Buffett announced his retirement in May, as some investors weighed whether Abel could oversee the conglomerate's vast operating businesses and equity portfolio with the same touch, while still justifying a premium valuation.Buffett departs with an unmatched record. After taking control of Berkshire in the mid-1960s, he turned a struggling textile maker into a compounding powerhouse. From 1964 through 2024, Berkshire delivered a compounded annual gain of 19.9%, nearly double the S&P 500's 10.4%, resulting in an overall return of more than 5.5 million percent.",

Clary | Afp | Getty ImagesThe new year is starting off looking a lot like the old one.The first trading day of 2026 kicked off Friday, with tech leading the way as it had last year. Nvidia advanced. Semiconductors rose as a group, with the VanEck Semiconductor ETF gaining more than 2%. Micron rallied more than 7%, while AMD gained more than 2%. They were higher earlier in the session, but have since vacillated. Artificial intelligence was the best trade of 2025, as it had been over the last three years, but it stumbled toward the finish line as investors, wary of high valuations, started to pivot toward other groups. The Nasdaq Composite, known for its heavy exposure toward tech companies, ended last year with two straight months of losses.  The rotation had many strategists nervous tech stocks will find an uphill climb more difficult in 2026, as traders start demanding companies justify their massive AI spending with profitable applications. Many investors called for a broadening out of the stock market, with companies more sensitive to the economic cycle taking the mantle from tech to lead the market in 2026. They viewed that as a healthy development to extend the bull market.It's very early, but so far, investors in 2026 are staying with their favorite technology stocks. Nancy Tengler, investment chief at Laffer Tengler Investments, said she plans to selectively buy any dips, as she had in the past year. CrowdStrike and AMD are among the names she highlighted in her portfolio. CrowdStrike was down slightly Friday.\"The tech names are where you want to be focused, and I think at least for another year,\" said Tengler, adding, \"Because the winners, in our view, are going to continue to win.\" Stock Chart IconStock chart iconNvidia, 1-day performanceOthers worry that the market could look less sanguine from here. Broadly speaking, according to the 2026 CNBC Market Strategist Survey, Wall Street expects the S&P 500 will climb by roughly 11% in 2026 — a respectable rise that nevertheless falls short of the advance of the last three.On Wednesday, Bank of America strategist Savita Subramanian noted the S&P 500 is expensive, meaning \"risks to the index abound in 2026.\" The strategist's 7,100 year-end target for the S&P 500 is among the lowest of those surveyed. Elsewhere, Adam Parker, founder of Trivariate Research, told CNBC's \"Squawk on the Street\" this past week that the level of optimism on the Street has him nervous for 2026. \"I think the consensus is pretty bullish,\" Parker said. \"You're betting on strong earnings growth, and I don't know if that's as likely.\" Still, tech's outperformance to start the new year suggests the AI trade still has legs, at least for now.",

    "body": "watch nowLabor market weakness, uncertainty about inflation and political pressure will push the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates aggressively in the early part of 2026, according to Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics.Though markets and Fed officials themselves see only modest easing in the year ahead, Zandi expects the central bank to enact three cuts of a quarter percentage point each before midyear.\"Behind the decision to ease monetary policy further will be the still flagging job market, particularly in the early part of 2026,\" the economist wrote in his look at the year ahead published recently. \"It will take more time for businesses to feel certain that they will not be wrong-footed by shifting trade and immigration policies and other threats before they resume hiring.\"\"Until then, job growth will remain insufficient to forestall further increases in unemployment, and as long as unemployment is on the rise, the Fed will cut rates,\" he added.Zandi's forecast is at least a step ahead of both market and Fed expectations, both of which point to a slower pace of reductions.Market pricing currently points to two cuts, the first not coming until at least April and the second more likely in the back half of the year, probably around September, according to CME futures data as expressed through its FedWatch gauge. Fed policymakers have an even more cautious outlook.The central bank's grid of individual officials' expectations indicates just one cut through the entire year, according to an update presented earlier in December. Minutes from that meeting showed the cut at the meeting was a close call, as officials expressed the likelihood of additional reductions but at a tepid pace.But Zandi thinks the confluence of factors will cause the Fed to move more quickly. One wild card: the potential for President Donald Trump to remake the central bank's hierarchy.As things stand now, three of the seven Fed governors are Trump appointees: Christopher Waller, Michelle Bowman and Stephen Miran. With Miran's term expiring in January, Trump is likely to appoint another loyalist to the post. From there, Chair Jerome Powell's term at the helm expires in May, though his term as governor runs into early 2028. In addition, the president is in the process of trying to remove Governor Lisa Cook, though courts have blocked him so far.That adds to the likelihood that the president, a staunch advocate of lower interest rates, will look to exert his will on the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee.\"Trump will also pressure for lower interest rates. Federal Reserve independence will steadily erode as the president appoints more members to the Federal Open Market Committee, including the Fed chair in May,\" Zandi wrote. \"Given the approaching midterm congressional elections, the political pressure on the Fed to lower rates further to support economic growth is likely to intensify.\"The FOMC meets again on Jan. 27-28. Market pricing is putting just a 13.8% probability of a cut at that meeting, according to the CME.",

The yellow metal notched a one-week low in the previous session.Spot silver prices, meanwhile, tumbled 5.6% to $72.15 per ounce, paring gains after climbing above $80 for the first time at the start of the week.The moves come at the end of a blockbuster year for the precious metals.Gold is up more than 64% year to date, on track for its best annual performance since 1979 and third straight positive year. The rally has been supported by a multitude of factors, including the impact of U.S. interest rate cuts, tariff tensions, and robust demand from exchange-traded funds and central banks.  Silver has far outpaced gold in 2025. The metal, which has endured wild price swings in recent days, is on course for annual gains of nearly 150%. Like gold, this would be silver's best yearly performance since 1979. Silver's price boom has stemmed from a mix of low supply and high demand from India, as well as industrial needs and tariffs.watch nowCME Group, one of the world's largest trading floors for commodities, said Tuesday that margins for gold, silver, platinum and palladium would increase again after the close of business Wednesday.

    "body": "watch nowDemocratic Socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders and right-wing Gov. Ron DeSantis agree on virtually nothing. But they found common ground this year as leading skeptics of the artificial intelligence industry's data center boom. The alignment of two national figures on the left and right signals that a political reckoning is brewing over the AI industry's impact on electricity prices, grid stability and the labor market. The opposition could slow the industry's development plans if it reaches a broad bipartisan consensus. Sanders, I-VT, has called for a national moratorium on data center construction. \"Frankly, I think you've got to slow this process down,\" Sanders told CNN in a Dec. 28 interview. \"It's not good enough for the oligarchs to tell us it's coming — you adapt. What are they talking about? They're going to guarantee healthcare to all people? What are they going to do when people have no jobs?\"Florida Gov. DeSantis unveiled an AI bill of rights on Dec. 4 that would protect local communities' right to block data center construction among other provisions. The staunch Republican's proposal could run afoul of the White House, which is pushing to scale up AI as quickly as possible. President Donald Trump issued an executive order on Dec. 11 to prevent \"excessive state regulation\" of AI.\"We have a limited grid. You do not have enough grid capacity in the United States to do what they're trying to do,\" DeSantis said of the AI industry's data center plans at an event in The Villages, Florida. \"As more and more information has gotten out, do you want a hyperscale data center in The Villages? Yes or no,\" the governor asked. \"I think most people would say they don't want it.\" DeSantis is finishing out his second term as Florida's governor and his future political ambitions are unclear. Sanders has said his fourth term as Vermont's senator will likely be his last. Florida and Vermont are not major data center states. But rising utility bills played a key role in the landslide victory of Democrat Abigail Spanberger in the governor's race this year in Virginia, the world's largest data center market. Residential electricity prices are forecast to rise another 4% on average nationwide in 2026 after increasing about 5% in 2025, according to the federal Energy Information Administration. With cost of living at the center of American politics, the impact of data centers on local communities will likely play a role in the mid-term elections next November. \"We have gone from a period where data centers were sort of seen as an unmitigated good and as an engine of growth by a lot of elected officials and policymakers to people now recognizing that we're short,\" said Abe Silverman, who served as general counsel for the public utility board in New Jersey from 2019 until 2023 under Democrat Gov. Phil Murphy. \"We do not have enough generation to reliably serve existing customers and data centers,\" Silverman said. Crisis on the biggest gridThe shortage is most acute on the nation's largest grid, PJM Interconnection, where data center demand is pushing the system to a tipping point. The grid will be six gigawatts short of its reliability requirement by 2027, according to PJM. The power shortage is nearly equivalent to the electricity demand of Philadelphia, Silverman said. This makes blackouts more likely, he said. \"Instead of a blackout happening every one in 10 years, we're looking at something more often,\" the analyst said. \"It's at a crisis stage right now. PJM has never been this short,\" said Joe Bowring, president of Monitoring Analytics, which serves as the independent market monitor for PJM.  PJM Interconnection serves more than 65 million people across 13 states in the Mid-Atlantic and Midwest. It includes pivotal swing states for the mid-term elections like Pennsylvania and Virginia. The price to secure power capacity in PJM has exploded in recent years with $23 billion attributable to data centers, according to watchdog Monitoring Analytics. Those costs are ultimately passed on to consumers. This amounts to a \"massive wealth transfer,\" the watchdog told PJM in a November letter.  \"I don't think we've seen the end of the political repercussions,\" said Rob Gramlich, president of Grid Strategies, a power sector consulting firm. \"And with a lot more elections in 2026 than 2025, we'll see a lot of implications,\" Gramlich said. \"Every politician is going to be saying that they have the answer to affordability and their opponents' policies would raise rates.\" The shortage will be exacerbated by Trump's recent decision to pause all offshore wind farms under construction off the East Coast, Silverman said. This includes Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind, a massive 2.6 gigawatt project that would help supply the huge data center market in northern Virginia.\"By stopping a project that had line of sight to coming online in the very near future, you are directly increasing the prices that we all pay for electricity and not by a little bit,\" Silverman said. \"That's a huge, huge additional hole that we now have to dig out of.\"Data centers are facing pushback on multiple fronts now. The PJM watchdog has called for the grid to reject data centers that it does not have the power to serve or require them to bring their own generation. Virginia's utility regulator is now requiring data centers to pay a majority of the cost of new transmission and generation that serves them beginning in 2027. Data center developers next year will likely start moving to build more power plants onsite, called co-location, as they struggle to secure supply on the grid quickly, said Brian Fitzsimons, CEO of GridUnity, a company that uses software to help utilities navigate connection requests. But Silverman said \"co-location\" has problems that will also face political scrutiny.  \"Co-location is effectively taking a generator off the market,\" he said. \"It would be unethical to end up with a situation where data centers are able to buy private power plants that expose the rest of us to a greater chance of blackouts.\" ",

Israel's Mossad spy agency issued a direct call on December 31, 2025,urging Iranians to press on with protests, saying it was supporting them \"on the ground\" as demonstrations spread in capital Tehran and other Iranian cities.  Protests began on December 28, 2025, with Tehran shopkeepers rallying against Iran's worsening economy have spread to other cities, drawing in students as well. (Photo by ATTA KENARE / AFP via Getty Images)Atta Kenare | Afp | Getty ImagesPresident Donald Trump said Friday that if Iran \"violently\" intervenes with peaceful protests, then the U.S. will \"come to their rescue.\"Unrest has been growing in Iran since last week, as protests erupted over the government's handling of a sharp fall in the nation's currency and soaring prices. Annual inflation hit 42.2% in December, with food prices jumping 72%. The protests turned violent this week as local media reported the death of at least six civilians.\"If Iran shots and violently kills peaceful protesters, which is their custom, the United States of America will come to their rescue,\" Trump wrote in a post on Truth Social on Friday.\"We are locked and loaded and ready to go,\" he added.Iran's supreme leader adviser Ali Larijani responded by saying that U.S. interference in Iran's protests was equivalent to chaos across the entire region on Friday, in comments reported by Reuters.watch nowSuzanne Maloney, vice president and director of foreign policy at the Brookings Institution, previously said that the Iranian people were calling for not just a fix to the economy, but for regime change. She added that Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has been in power for 36 years.\"We're hearing cries of Death to the dictator. We're hearing slogans that juxtapose the regime's support for militia groups across the region with the real interests and demands of the Iranian people,\" Maloney told CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" on Wednesday.Iran's economy has struggled since Trump pulled the U.S. out of the Iranian nuclear deal in 2018 and re-imposed sanctions on the country. Last year in June, U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear sites escalated tensions, pulling Washington into Israel's war with its longtime regional rival.Earlier this week, Trump threatened additional military action against Iran if the country attempts to build up its reserves of ballistic weapons and reestablish its nuclear program.\"Now, I hear that Iran is trying to build up again, and if they are we're going to have to knock them down. We'll knock them down. We'll knock the hell out of them. But hopefully that's not happening,\" Trump said on Monday.Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian responded on Tuesday in a post on X, saying that the response of the Islamic Republic of Iran to any \"oppressive aggression will be harsh and regrettable.\"  Foreign policy has dominated Trump's schedule in recent weeks. On Tuesday, the U.S. announced sanctions on a group of 10 individuals and entities based in Iran and Venezuela that are allegedly linked to the weapons trade between the two countries.— CNBC's Justin Papp contributed to this report.",

    "body": "Britain's FTSE 100 index on Friday briefly surpassed the symbolic 10,000 points marker for the first time, extending gains after a bumper 2025.The FTSE 100 index — home to the U.K.'s most valuable blue-chip companies — stood 0.5% higher to trade at 9,981 at 12:00 p.m. London time (7:00 a.m. Eastern time), kicking off the first trading day of the year in positive territory. The index surpassed the 10,000 threshold at around 8:30 a.m., before paring gains. Analysts told CNBC late last year that while the speed of the FTSE 100′s rise to the 10,000-point level was notable, investors should remain wary. \"Passing any large round number on an index is psychologically important but the foundations for the move have to be solid for the new level to set a floor rather than act as a ceiling for the index,\" said Toni Meadows, head of investment at BRI Wealth Management. The pan-European Stoxx 600 index, meanwhile, rose 0.5%, with most sectors and major bourses in the green. The moves come as investors return from the New Year's Day holiday on Thursday and after stellar annual gains.The Stoxx 600 index rose nearly 16% during 2025, notching its third consecutive year of gains, as it was led higher by banking stocks and a surge in regional defense spending.Looking at individual stocks, shares of Danish energy group Orsted rose 3.6% after the world's largest developer of offshore wind farms said it had challenged the U.S. government's suspension of the lease for its Revolution Wind joint venture and would seek a court injunction. Dutch semiconductor equipment makers Be Semiconductor and ASMI topped the index, up 9.6% and 6.1%, respectively, after the U.S. government granted an annual licence to the world's largest chip manufacturer Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company to import U.S. chip manufacturing equipment to its facilities in Nanjing, China, according to a Thursday Reuters report. CNBC has reached out to TSMC for comment. Larger peer ASML, the most valuable company in Europe, rose 4%.Mining and defense stocks were also among the top performers. Thyssenkrupp, Kongsberg Group, Saab, and Rolls-Royce were all up at least 3% during morning deals.Gold and silver prices rallyElsewhere, precious metals continued their upward trend from last year. Spot gold prices rose 1.9% to $4,393.14 per ounce during European hours, while spot silver prices jumped over 4.3% to $74.31 per ounce.Gold and silver notched their best annual performances since 1979 last year, supported by a multitude of factors, including the impact of U.S. interest rate cuts, tariff tensions, and robust demand from exchange-traded funds and central banks.In Asia-Pacific trade, South Korea's Kospi climbed to a new record, while markets including Japan and mainland China remain closed for the holidays.U.S. stock futures, meanwhile, traded higher. S&P futures, Nasdaq-100 futures, and Dow Jones Industrial Average futures were last seen between 0.4% and 1.1% higher.— CNBC's Chloe Taylor contributed to this report.",

    "body": "Singapore tops the list in the 2025 Global Talent Competitiveness Index by INSEAD and Portulans Institute.Calvin Chan Wai Meng | E+ | Getty ImagesSingapore's economy expanded 5.7% year on year for the fourth quarter, the highest since 2021, driven mainly by a sharp increase in manufacturing output during the three months through December.The Ministry of Trade and Industry said that Singapore's manufacturing sector posted a 15% expansion, a massive jump compared to the 4.9% growth in the third quarter. Growth during the quarter was largely driven by the biomedical manufacturing and electronics clusters, the ministry said.Manufacturing makes up about 20% of the city-state's GDP.Most other sectors contracted during the quarter, including construction and services.The advance estimate was higher than the revised 4.3% growth in the previous quarter, lifting full-year GDP growth to 4.8%, as announced by Prime Minister Lawrence Wong in his New Year's message. The 4.8% growth had surpassed the country's Ministry of Trade and Industry's upgraded forecast of \"around 4%\" in November. \"This is a better outcome than we expected, given the circumstances,\" Wong said, while warning that sustaining the current pace of growth would be challenging.Singapore's MTI had forecast a GDP growth figure of about 1%-3% for 2026. Selena Ling, Chief Economist & Head of Group Research & Strategy at OCBC, said that Singapore's GDP performance \"showcased economic resilience through broad-based and diversified strengths in manufacturing, services, and construction.\"Ling projected GDP growth of about 2% in 2026, assuming manufacturing growth eases to around 2.2% year on year due to a high base in 2025.Singapore had earlier cautioned that 2025 would be challenging, citing trade risks after U.S. President Donald Trump's administration slapped trade tariffs on dozens of countries in his \"Liberation Day\" on April.Despite having a free trade agreement with the U.S. since 2004, Singapore was hit with the 10% baseline tariff. Wong said at the time that \"these are not actions one does to a friend.\"Singapore is highly dependent on trade, with its trade-to-GDP ratio exceeding 320% in 2024, according to data from the World Bank.The country also warned in April last year that zero growth was a possibility and eased monetary policy twice in 2025 to prepare for a slowdown.

But concerns about President Donald Trump's trade war, skittish consumers and an oversupply of domestic seats brought U.S. airfare down and weighed on industry profits.\"It's the airline version of the K-shaped economy. Monetize the top of the K and minimize the shortfall at the bottom,\" said Robert Mann, who has worked at several airlines and is president of aviation consulting firm R.W. Mann & Co. Now, the leaders of the country's biggest airlines are putting even more focus on customers who will pay extra for their tickets in exchange for a little more space or other perks like earlier boarding and access to never-sufficient overhead bin space.The view into American Airlines first-class cabin on a Boeing 737.Leslie Josephs/CNBCThey still face continued problems, like a shortage of air traffic controllers and aging infrastructure. Despite billions of additional federal spending to fix some of the problems, major improvements will take years.Mann said airlines need to do more to improve reliability. U.S. carriers had a 77% on-time rate, according to the Department of Transportation, which defines on-time as arrival within 15 minutes of the schedule.\"When the flight is late or canceled, it doesn't matter if you're at the top of the K or the bottom of the K,\" he said.Here's how the next year is shaping up for the airline industry:Winners take (almost) allThrough the first nine months of the year, Delta and United Airlines accounted for nearly all of U.S. airline profits. It's an industry divide that's been brewing for years, further fueled by a surge in costs and shifting consumer tastes as wealthier travelers have increased their share of overall spending.While the economy has been resilient for the most part, any weakening in 2026 could have an outsize effect on more price-sensitive consumers and, therefore, airlines that are more exposed to coach-class domestic travel, like lower-cost carriers.Those airlines have been making moves of their own. JetBlue Airways, for example, has been shifting its focus to more profitable routes and premium seats. It plans to debut a domestic business class in mid-2026 with seats up at the front of the cabin that are roomier but not quite as elaborate as its top-tier lie-flat Mint suites. Stable faresAirfare will likely remain steady next year over 2025, according to an American Express Global Business Travel forecast in mid-November. Demand has rebounded after dropping during a record-long government shutdown, but it's not clear whether 2026 will be a blockbuster.Southwest Airlines CEO Bob Jordan told CNBC in December that the \"first quarter looks strong\" but that \"it's hard to say,\" whether it will be better than a year ago.Read more CNBC airline newsAmerican Airlines no longer lets basic economy flyers earn milesArchitect of Delta's premium strategy to retire in FebruaryFrontier Airlines replaces longtime CEO Barry Biffle with carrier's presidentSouthwest CEO says airline 'actively pursuing' network of airport loungesWhither SpiritStruggling budget travel icon Spirit Airlines is in its second bankruptcy in less than a year after a court-blocked acquisition by JetBlue, an engine grounding, a surge in costs and other problems, raising questions about its ability to survive. Industry insiders and airline analysts have said the yellow-plane airline will have to make much bigger moves with this bankruptcy.\"We do not expect it to remain a standalone company this time next year, with a merger or Chapter 7 outcome likely to drive upside to our earnings forecast,\" said a Raymond James note on Dec. 19.watch nowAnalysts expect that merger partner would be Frontier Airlines, the fellow budget airline that has attempted to combine with Spirit repeatedly since 2022, but it's not clear whether the two sides will reach a deal. Spirit said earlier this month that it's in \"active negotiations\" for a stand-alone reorganization or a transaction. Frontier and Spirit declined to comment further. Southwest transformedSouthwest's preparing for a major change in 2026. The airline's decades-long cattle call will end on Jan. 27 when assigned seating begins. It's coming off a slew of changes it already put into place last year. It debuted extra legroom seats that command higher prices and started charging many customers to check bags for the first time, a service that brought in more than $7 billion for its U.S. rivals in 2024, the last full year of available data, according to the Transportation Department.The carrier's stock is the top gainer of U.S. passenger airlines. Southwest shares rose nearly 23% in 2025 compared with the NYSE Arca Airline Index's 5% advance, and beat out profit leaders Delta and United as well as the broader market.Investors have been bullish on the company's transformation to a more traditional, segmented airline, which has been sped along by a stake from activist investor Elliott Investment Management.American makeoverAmerican is expanding its lounges and launching a fleet of Airbus 321XLR planes in 2026 as it aims to catch up in the luxury travel boom. Free inflight Wi-Fi is also coming for loyalty program members starting in January, American said last spring.The airline already made more minor changes, like adding Lavazza coffee for all its passengers and Champagne Bollinger for its top-tier lounges and cabins, to uplift its brand as well, but it has a long path to reach Delta's and United's profitability.American Airlines and Delta planes on the tarmac at LaGuardia Airport (LGA) in the Queens borough of New York, US, on Friday, Nov. 7, 2025.Michael Nagle | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesJust before Christmas, American also announced that it will no longer award customers on its no-frills basic economy tickets with frequent flyer miles, following a similar move by Delta several years ago. American hasn't yet announced changes to its elite status requirements for 2027, but the carrier is under pressure because Delta and United have said they will hold status thresholds steady.The airline is also making some changes that aim to improve reliability, recently announcing it will increase so-called banks, or clusters of flights at its largest hub, Dallas Fort Worth International Airport, from nine to 13.American also said it is testing out two electronic gates there, where passengers on narrow-body domestic flights scan their own boarding passes, in hopes of getting travelers on planes faster, and in September, it said it will remove bag sizers from gates.",

In a company-compiled consensus posted to its website on Dec. 29, Tesla said analysts it surveyed were expecting a 15% drop from a year earlier to 422,850 vehicles.Deliveries for Q4 2025 were about 16% lower than the fourth quarter of 2024, when Musk's EV company reported 495,570. Q4 2025 numbers for production were down 5.5% from a year ago, when Tesla produced 459,445 vehicles.For the full year, Tesla's deliveries fell 8.6% to 1.64 million from 1.79 million in 2024.Tesla said deliveries of its entry-level Model 3 sedan and Model Y SUV amounted to 406,585 in the fourth-quarter, or about 97% of total deliveries. Deliveries of its Model S, Model X and Cybertruck vehicles came in at 11,642 during the quarter. After its design debut, Tesla boasted about more than 1 million reservations flooding in for the Cybertruck. The angular, steel pickup has yet to be a best seller for the company. Musk's aerospace and defense company, SpaceX, reportedly purchased tens of millions of dollars worth of Cybertrucks in 2025.Tesla faces heightened competition in the electric vehicle market from China's BYD, South Korea's Kia and Hyundai, and Volkswagen in Europe, among others.BYD topped Tesla as the world's biggest seller of EVs in a calendar year, saying in a statement Thursday that sales grew 28% to 2.26 million units.Deliveries are the closest approximation of sales reported by Tesla, but are not precisely defined in the company's shareholder communications.In its energy business, Tesla said that it deployed 14.2 gigawatt hours of battery energy storage products in the fourth quarter, following a record in the prior period, when it deployed 12.5 GWh. Tesla's battery energy storage systems include backup batteries for homes and larger systems used alongside data centers and utilities. Tesla will report its fourth-quarter financial results on Jan. 28.Sales of Tesla's cars were impacted by President Donald Trump's decision to end a federal EV incentive by Sept. 30, earlier than previously planned. The expiration pulled some EV sales forward to the third quarter for Tesla and other automakers. Even before that, the start of 2025 was a struggle for Tesla.After spending heavily to propel Trump back to the White House, Musk spent the first quarter of the year leading the president's DOGE initiative to slash the federal workforce. Musk also endorsed Germany's extremist anti-immigrant party, AfD, and later supported British anti-Muslim and anti-immigration activist Tommy Robinson. In recent weeks, Musk has called to abolish the European Union.Partly in response to Musk's incendiary rhetoric, Tesla has faced an enduring consumer backlash in Europe and the U.S. The company hasn't fully recovered despite introducing a new, more affordable version of its Model Y SUV in October.However, Tesla shares still rallied in the second half of the year, jumping 40% in the third quarter, reaching a fresh record in mid-December. Musk bought $1 billion worth of shares in September.Shareholders approved a new $1 trillion pay plan for Musk in November that will give the CEO more shares and increased control over the company. The vote came after Musk threatened to potentially leave Tesla if the plan didn't pass. Critics voiced concerns that the plan doesn't require Musk to spend a minimum amount of time on his Tesla work, and that there are no limits on his political activity.

Tesla's European registrations fell 39% in the first 11 months of 2025, while Chinese rival BYD saw registrations rise 240% in Europe. Overall, battery electric vehicles were more widely embraced in Europe in 2025, amounting to around 16% of all new vehicles sold there.Some analysts project that sales of Tesla's more affordable Model Y standard, which the company launched in October, will help the company regain ground in coming quarters.In a note last week, analysts at Cannacord Genuity wrote that EV adoption \"is rising quickly in emerging markets such as Thailand, Vietnam, and Brazil, where robust consumer interest could create meaningful long-term upside for Tesla, even as it faces fierce rivalry from Chinese automakers.\" Besides BYD, Tesla now faces competition from other Chinese EV makers including Xiaomi and Geely.But Tesla is selling investors on Musk's vision of the future, or what he calls \"sustainable abundance,\" more than EV sales. That vision includes robotaxis, which Musk has promised for years, and humanoid robots, which he says will someday be able to serve as factory workers, babysitters, crime stoppers and surgeons.

Yum! Brands owns fast-food chains like KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell, and operates them in India through franchise partners such as Devyani International, Sapphire Foods India and Burman Hospitality.The deal would combine the two major franchisee operators for Yum! Brands in India into a single entity, overseeing KFC and Pizza Hut in the country.

Shares of Sapphire Foods India fell as much as 6.4% at the open.The merger is expected to take effect within 12 to 15 months, subject to regulatory and shareholder approval. The companies said the deal would accelerate KFC's expansion in the country and help revitalize Pizza Hut, which trails market leader Domino's by a wide margin.\"India is a high-priority market for us\" said Yum! Brands' chief financial officer Ranjith Roy.

    "body": "A graph displaying the Apple stock price on a smartphone app.Jaap Arriens | Nurphoto | Getty ImagesRetail investors have had a gangbuster year in 2025.Mom-and-pop investors bought the dip at key points this year, providing strong returns as the market climbed to all-time highs. Once thought of as unsophisticated and easily duped, a new breed of retail investor is giving the professionals who have long dismissed them a run for their money, according to investors and market data analysts interviewed by CNBC. \"Retail is just getting smarter, and they're getting hardened to the market,\" said Mark Malek, investing chief at Siebert Financial. In other words: These investors \"really are growing up.\"Individual traders bought the dip at a faster clip during market drawdowns early in the year, according to JPMorgan quant analyst Arun Jain, who called it a \"successful year\" for this group. It was an effective strategy: 2025 is shaping up to be the second-best year since at least the early 1990s for dip-buying, per Bespoke Investment Group data published this month.From May onward, JPMorgan said, these investors shifted their focus from single stocks to exchange-traded funds. The group particularly dove into the SPDR Gold Shares (GLD) fund, with JPMorgan finding 2025 inflows topped the last five years combined. The gold-focused ETF has seen a record-setting surge of more than 65% this year amid the precious metal's rise to all-time highs.The result: retail investors' single-stock portfolios recorded stronger profit-to-loss ratios than baskets tied to artificial intelligence and software run by JPMorgan, according to data from the bank released earlier this month. Everyday investors' ETF holdings had substantially higher profit rates than the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) and Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ), the firm found.'TACO' and buying the dipA significant driver of their strong performance this year goes back to a week in April that had investors of all sizes on the edge of their seats.Big money ran for the hills as President Donald Trump first unveiled his plan for broad and steep tariffs on most foreign countries on April 2, which he dubbed \"liberation day.\" The S&P 500 briefly slipped into bear market territory as institutional investors worried the policy would drive up inflation and weigh on corporate earnings.But retail investors jumped head first into the turbulence. They bought a record of more than $3 billion in equities on net on April 3 — even as the S&P 500 fell around 5% in the session, according to market research firm VandaTrack. Elevated buying continued the following day despite the benchmark average dropping another 6%.Trump put most of his steepest duties on pause April 9, exactly one week after \"liberation day.\" Small-scale stockholders were on the ground floor of the S&P 500's 9.5% surge that session. The broad index has climbed more than 21% since April 2. It's on track to finish 2025 higher by more than 17% after hitting several new intraday and closing records.\"We often talk about retail as being sort of late to the party,\" said Viraj Patel, Vanda's deputy head of research. \"But this has been the polar opposite.\"Stock Chart IconStock chart iconS&P 500, year to dateAt Siebert, Malek said the professionals were starting to get nervous as the S&P 500 fell below 5,000 during the tariff-induced sell-off. But their retail traders continued buying all the way down, drawing on their past successes in increasing exposure amid pullbacks as opposed to panicking.Retail investors \"have been more right about the market and how to react to, certainly, a lot of the emotionally driven trades of the year,\" Malek said. \"They've been much more accurate in their dealings than my colleagues in the institutional space.\"Beyond believing in buying the dip, these traders also benefited from a conviction that the \"TACO trade\" would pan out, according to Zhi Da, a finance professor at the University of Notre Dame who studies retail trader activity.Known in full as \"Trump Always Chickens Out,\" this strategy encourages investors to buy into stocks when policy decisions from the White House cause market downturns, with the expectation that the actions will be reversed. On the other hand, institutional counterparts have been more cautious about trading around Trump's policies, Da said.Da acknowledged there was some luck involved and that 2025 was an \"exception\" to the rule. Typically, retail investors buy market dips too late and don't benefit as much on average, he said.A 'more sophisticated' investorRetail's positive 2025 comes years into the investing boom among everyday Americans that began during the pandemic. The next serious downturn in the market will test whether the elevated participation will last.More than one out of every three 25-year-olds in 2024 moved significant sums from checking to investing accounts since they turned 22, according to JPMorgan data released earlier this year. That's up from just 6% of 25-year-olds in 2015.JPMorgan found 2025 retail flows surged to records, up more than 50% from last year and about 14% higher than the meme stock craze in early 2021. Individual investors' share of total stock trades this year climbed to highs last seen during that short-squeeze mania four years ago, according to data from a working paper by professors at Chapman University, Boston College and the University of Illinois.The narrative during 2021's meme stock surge — which centered on stocks like GameStop and AMC — was that retail traders made simplistic investing decisions to \"stick it to the man.\" Two years later, the sentiment toward these meme-stock era market participants was captured in a film starring Paul Dano, Pete Davidson, Seth Rogen and Sebastian Stan called \"Dumb Money.\" Vanda's Patel and others said that view is changing. Small investors are taking advantage of the widening access to market research and data — and getting a better reputation on Wall Street as a result, they said. Retail has also established itself as being more adept at buying at lows, increasingly putting them in the arena with bigger counterparts, Patel said.\"The average retail investor's just becoming more and more sophisticated,\" Patel said. \"This year has been kind of a good testament to that.\"A scene from the trailer for the film \"Dumb Money\" starring Paul Dano.Courtesy: Sony Pictures EntertainmentTo be sure, a new class of meme stocks including OpenDoor emerged this year. But Vanda found far more retail investor dollars in 2025 have been directed to names like Nvidia, Tesla and Palantir that outperformed the market over recent years.Siebert's Malek said he's found everyday traders to be increasingly focused on longer-term investing, which can keep them from panic selling when the market goes down. Still, one question is top of mind for Malek and other investing leaders: What will retail traders do when the stock market, after multiple years of big gains, finally hits a lasting rough patch?For now, retail investors are taking notice of their improved standing.Real estate professional Josh Franklin remembers a decade ago when they were easily written off by big investors. The 28-year-old Tampa resident, who has invested in stocks like Robinhood and Palantir over the years and spends dozens of hours a week studying the market, now sees the small guy as central to the story.\"Back then, no one really cared about retail. They thought retail was dumb money,\" Franklin said. \"Now, retail kind of leads the charts.\"",

    "body": "It's one of the most important questions surrounding the Federal Reserve in 2026, and Fed Chair Jerome Powell has been pointedly mum.\"I'm focused on my remaining time as chair,\" Powell said at the December press conference. \"I haven't got anything new on that to tell you.\"The question: whether Powell will remain on the Fed once his chairmanship ends in May. He will have two years left on his term as governor and Powell himself has invited the speculation by repeatedly refusing to answer the question.It's a question being asked on Wall Street as Fed watchers try to game out the makeup of the rate-setting Open Market Committee and whether appointees of President Donald Trump will have control of the Fed's powerful Board of Governors. And it's being asked in the Treasury Department and the White House, where they are trying to figure out how many slots on the board Trump will have to fill this year, who might fill them and when those slots will be available.It's a question that has not been asked in decades because prior chairs, like Ben Bernanke and Janet Yellen, slid quietly off the board into other government positions, retirement or the private sector with time remaining on their governor terms. That the question about Powell is even unclear is a sign of the times with a president who, in unprecedented ways, openly seeks control of Fed policy and a Fed chair who has defiantly resisted that encroachment and tried to protect the Fed's independence.Fed observers interviewed by CNBC said they see it as a wrenching decision for Powell that pits the personal against the professional. A golfer, avid guitar player and relatively new grandfather, Powell is thought to be more than ready for civilian life after 13 years at the Fed, including eight as chair. For much of those eight years, Powell endured withering public criticism from the president, who named him as chair.But after that lengthy tenure, Powell also holds deep loyalty to the institution and concern about its fate under the challenges posed by a president who has virtually eliminated the independence of multiple government entities. Trump has repeatedly pressured the Fed to lower rates and made clear that his nominee needs to agree with him or they \"will never be Fed Chairman.\"Most of those interviewed by CNBC, who said they had no personal knowledge of what Powell would decide, said they believe Powell will likely leave the Fed when his term as chair ends in May. None, however, would rule out some possibility that Powell would decide to stay, perhaps for a short time. Only former Fed Chair Marriner Eccles stayed on as a governor when his 14-year tenure as chair ended in 1948. As a governor, Eccles was instrumental in striking the 1951 Treasury-Fed accord that ended the Fed's obligation to keep rates low and helped establish the modern notion of Fed independence. The Trump administration wants to lower rates, in part, to reduce the cost of servicing the U.S. debt.On one level, the decision for Powell is a simple one of math. Three Trump appointees currently sit on the seven-member board of governors. If Powell leaves that would immediately hand the president the majority of the board. If they voted as a bloc — an uncertain assumption — it could go a long way toward delivering the president his call for ultra-low interest rates.Of more concern, the Federal Reserve Act appears to give the board's majority the ability to fire individual bank presidents who oppose rate cuts. There is some doubt about whether the firing could be done without cause, but Powell's continued presence on the board, even if he were in the minority, could help stave off such extreme outcomes.Among those interviewed by CNBC, some suggested the outcome of Fed Gov. Lisa Cook's case could weigh on Powell's decision. Trump fired Cook amid an allegation of mortgage fraud, which she has denied. Courts have stayed the firing and allowed Cook to remain in office. The Justice Department has not brought charges against Cook.But the Supreme Court will hear the case on January 21 with a decision sometime after that. If Cook is removed, that would immediately give Trump the majority. The question is whether it comes with broad authority from the Supreme Court for the president to remove other board members. In that case, Powell would likely be next on the president's attack list.Much of the concern, however, assumes a worst-case scenario that might not be warranted. There is no guarantee that governors appointed by the president will do his bidding. For example, all three Trump-appointed governors just voted to reappoint all 12 district bank presidents to new five-year terms, though the board would still have the power to remove them individually.One area of speculation is whether Powell is attempting to exercise leverage over the administration. By not revealing his choice, Powell could be sending a message that he would stay if the president nominates extreme candidates but would go if he deems them reasonable. There is no evidence that Powell is actually thinking that way. Powell has remained generally apolitical on fiscal issues during his tenure and has not responded publicly to the president's frequent insults.All of which leads several Fed observers to believe Powell will ultimately leave when his tenure as chair is up. Staying would be on overtly political move, one that would buck recent institutional tradition and open the Fed to even greater political criticism. Powell would then be undermining the very institution he was trying to preserve by staying.Another theory: Powell's refusal now to say what he will do could be considered a simple, symbolic exercise of independence, reiterating that it's his legal right to decide when he leaves and he will announce his intentions when he's ready.",

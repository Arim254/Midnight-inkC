    "body": "It's important to build resilience, but how do we actually do it? I've spent 15 years researching happiness, and I've interviewed thousands of people about what makes it possible for them to thrive. I've learned that resilience isn't something you're born with. It's not even about bouncing back, a concept that often does more harm than good. Real resilience is about building specific habits that train your brain to weather difficulty without breaking. Here are 9 habits that actually work:1. Reframing stress as a signal, not a threatIf your heart is racing before your big meeting, your instinct might be to panic. Before you do, pause and tell yourself: \"I'm excited about this.\"I know it sounds like toxic positivity. It's not. Research shows that this simple reframing, shifting from a threat to a challenge, can change your physiological response. Your body doesn't easily distinguish between anxiety and excitement. The only difference is your interpretation. 2. Making one micro-decision daily with confidenceWhen you constantly second-guess yourself, your brain learns that you can't be trusted to handle outcomes. Confident micro-decisions can help rewire your brain and boost your trust in yourself.So pick your lunch without researching five options. Commit to a movie in two minutes flat. Send the email without editing it 10 times. This teaches your brain: \"I can decide and handle what comes next, even if it's not perfect.\" That's the exact skill you need in a crisis. 3. Building your support system with intentionIt's extremely difficult to maintain deep relationships with hundreds of people. Research has found we can manage about 150 stable relationships, but only about five truly intimate ones. The most emotionally resilient people don't spread their emotional energy thin or try to handle everything alone. They invest in these core relationships. And when things do get hard, they have people in their corner who can help them carry the weight. 4. Creating a 'done' list instead of a to-do listMost of us focus on what's left undone. It's a perpetual sense of failure. I want you to flip this.Every day, write down what you actually accomplished, even the small stuff. Over time, your brain stops noticing gaps and starts noticing progress. That shift is where resilience lives.5. Noticing and savoring one good moment every dayWhen you deliberately pay attention to positive moments, you rewire neural pathways for happiness. Pick one moment a day worth savoring. A good conversation. A small win. Really good coffee. Spend 30 seconds actually noticing it. This practice counteracts your brain's obsession with what's wrong and builds psychological resilience, one moment at a time.6. Practicing honesty in your closest relationshipsBe vulnerable with the people who matter to you. Tell someone about a real challenge. Ask for honest feedback, not just agreement. Have conversations where things might get uncomfortable.The most resilient people feel safe to be themselves without fear of judgement. Being open with people who you trust can help build that muscle. 7. Helping someone else, before you need helpThis sounds counterintuitive until you realize that helping others is a powerful recharge practice. Plus, you're building your support system for the future. You're reinforcing your identity as capable and resourceful.Most importantly, you remember that resilience is also about contributing and mattering to other people.8. Asking yourself, 'What's the worst that could happen?'Most people avoid this question because they are afraid of the answer. But research shows that actually imagining the worst-case scenario can reduce anxiety, not increase it.So after you ask yourself, \"What's the worst that could happen?\" actually sit with the question. Then ask yourself, \"Could I handle that?\" The answer is usually yes. Maybe not easily, but yes.The most resilient people understand that bad things can happen, but the most important thing is to be confident that you can handle them when they do.9. Practicing these habits in low-stakes momentsEmotional resilience is a skill you can hone. It doesn't require therapy, meditation retreats, or years of work. Start with just one or two of these habits. Reframe stress when the stakes are low. Build your support relationships now, not when you're desperate. Make confident decisions about small things, so you're ready for big things.Jessica Weiss is a keynote speaker and executive coach who teaches people and businesses how to find more happiness, fulfillment and satisfaction at work.

    "body": "For couples, \"holidays are a scary time\" because they often call for revealing a new side of yourself to your partner, says Sabrina Romanoff, New York-based psychologist and a relationship expert for dating app Hily. Some people have decades-long, big family traditions they want to uphold. Others prefer to keep it low key. Whatever the activities are, and whatever the meaning behind them, opening up about what matters to you can feel very vulnerable.  Ultimately, the goal is to blend \"each other's cultures and worlds,\" says Romanoff. Here's how successful couples tackle this festive time of year. They're 'direct and honest' about what they want First, each partner has to know what they want and be open about it.Do they want their partner to join them for their family Christmas? Do they want to take some time off and have a quiet Hanukkah? \"You are better off being direct and honest with your partner so you both can really get what you both need,\" says Romanoff.Ultimately, there will likely have to be some flexibility, on both sides. \"I think the healthiest couples are those who can get creative and compromise,\" she says. \"There's only one Christmas Eve, there's only one Christmas Day.\" Maybe this year, the couple spends time with one side's family and next year they spend time with the other. They create new traditions togetherSecond, successful couples create new traditions together. \"That could mean going to see the tree together a Rockefeller Center,\" says Romanoff, \"or getting an ornament together.\" It could mean cooking a holiday meal or doing a hot chocolate crawl. Building something new together is a bonding experience. \"I think that's what brings security\" in the relationship, she says.Want to give your kids the ultimate advantage?

    "body": "Most parents know the frustration of dealing with a child's unexpected public tantrum.But parents are often too quick to call out their child's negative behavior — chastising them for that unnecessary meltdown or even telling them to \"cheer up\" when they seem sad — while ignoring the underlying emotions behind those actions, according to parenting expert Reem Raouda.Focusing solely on children's behaviors, particularly bad behavior, rather than investigating and validating their emotions is a common parenting mistake that hinders your child's ability to develop emotional intelligence, says Raouda, an author and certified conscious parenting coach.\"Stop focusing on their behavior and start focusing on their [well-being],\" she says. \"Children are not robots, and their emotions are being completely ignored, dismissed [or even] punished.\"Experts often link emotional intelligence to success, because it helps people manage the kinds of negative emotions that could otherwise lead to burnout, anxiety or depression, research shows.\"Your emotional well-being is your success,\" says Raouda, adding that parents who ignore their kids' emotional development are less likely to raise happy, successful adults. \"Who cares about how much money you have, if you are anxiety-ridden, depressed, [and] don't know who you are?\"DON'T MISS: The ultimate guide to teaching your kids about moneyParents do need to enforce boundaries, Raouda says, particularly when a child's outburst involves mistreating other people. They also need to remind kids that their feelings — positive or negative — are normal, and that it's healthy to express them constructively, she says.Focus on \"not making them feel bad for their anger [and] not telling them to cheer up when they're sad,\" says Raouda. \"Letting them be in their feelings is No. 1.\"You might, for example, ask your child what they were feeling that led them to act out, break a rule or otherwise cross a previously established boundary. Helping your kids name their emotions is the first step toward them developing the ability to manage those emotions, Raouda says.Some other experts agree: Children who feel heard and not shamed for their feelings typically become more open to avoiding negative behaviors, according to psychologist Caroline Fleck. \"The point is to validate the emotion and then focus on what's not valid, which is the behavior [and that's] what needs to change,\" Fleck told CNBC Make It in January.Parents who overemphasize obedience, which can require the suppression of big feelings, run the risk of raising people-pleasers who can't advocate for themselves and are more likely to grow into anxious, unhappy adults, Raouda says.A mother herself, Raouda says she'd practice emotion-naming exercises with her son even when he was too young to articulate how he was feeling on his own. That involved asking if he was angry or frustrated and, if so, having him rank the severity of his feelings on a scale of 1 to 10, she says.And when parents feel emotional themselves, they can tell their children directly: I'm upset, or I'm sad. The idea is to show your children that you don't have to suppress those negative feelings, says Raouda.\"Naming it takes away from the [negative] stigma,\" she says. \"It's just, like, 'Yeah, I was angry, I was embarrassed, I was sad, I was nervous' … Feelings are normal and healthy and fine.\"Want to give your kids the ultimate advantage?

    "body": "Chris Ratcliffe | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesTween retailer Claire's is facing legal challenges from some of its Asia-based suppliers over millions in unpaid debts as it tries to emerge from a second bankruptcy under new ownership, according to claims the suppliers filed in Hong Kong. The clash with vendors comes as private equity firm Ames Watson navigates its first holiday season as Claire's new owner and works to ensure it has the right merchandise in stock after buying the mall retailer and about 1,000 of its stores out of bankruptcy for $140 million in September.Since acquiring Claire's, Ames Watson has been trying to rebuild what co-founder Lawrence Berger previously told CNBC is a \"broken business.\" Its bid to get the company back to profitability will hinge in part on a successful holiday season and its ability to stock popular merchandise moving forward. The retailer's sprawling supply chain, made up of longtime vendors equipped to handle the rigorous safety standards governing children's products, has long been considered the company's \"secret sauce,\" former Claire's CEO Ron Marshall told CNBC. Without the support of those suppliers during its first bankruptcy in 2018, the retailer's holiday season would've been a \"nightmare,\" said Marshall, who led the company from 2016 to 2019.The dispute with suppliers adds another challenge for Ames Watson as it tries to fix the long struggling retailer. As the U.S. hits the final days of peak shopping, Ames Watson said \"Claire's has inventory in place for the holiday season.\"A clash over ordersClaire's disputes with its suppliers in Asia surround orders placed in the months before the retailer's second bankruptcy filing in August, when it was still owned by hedge fund Elliott Management and having financial difficulties. Claire's ordering volume for one supplier had dropped by 79% in March and 76% in April compared to the prior year, records reviewed by CNBC show. Then ordering ramped back up to the company's regular cadence in May and June, with volume down only 2% and 3% in those months, respectively, compared to 2024, according to the records.At the time Claire's increased its orders again, the company was running out of cash, considering outright liquidation and looking for a buyer to save its business, according to a declaration Claire's CEO Chris Cramer filed with the court after the company filed for bankruptcy. While the vendors, including those who are now pursuing legal action against the retailer, were aware the company was navigating financial difficulties when the orders were placed, they expected to be paid as they had been during the retailer's first bankruptcy filing, said the people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the discussions were private. watch nowBut by the time the vendors finished manufacturing the body jewelry, nail polish and friendship bracelets Claire's had ordered ahead of the holiday shopping season, the retailer had filed for bankruptcy protection and the vendors weren't paid for some orders, the people said. When Ames Watson acquired the company, some of the vendors who were owed money agreed to keep working with Claire's without getting paid for those debts, concerned they'd lose one of their largest clients and potentially their business, the people said. But others refused, and have taken legal action against Claire's Hong Kong-based sourcing office RSI International, over millions in unpaid debts, according to claims the suppliers filed in the local court. Meanwhile, about a week after Ames Watson announced it would acquire Claire's out of bankruptcy, RSI International filed a notice to transfer its assets to a new entity. The business transfer gave creditors 30 days to file a claim to recoup unpaid debts, after which transferors aren't responsible for the obligations under Hong Kong Law.  In a statement to CNBC, Ames Watson didn't comment on RSI International. It said it was \"not involved in the operation or purchasing decisions made prior to the acquisition.\" \"Since then, we have focused on responsibly stewarding the business and engaging suppliers in good faith as we strengthen Claire's for the long term,\" the company said. \"We are excited about the company's direction in 2026,\" it added.Hedge fund Elliott Management, which owned Claire's at the time the orders were placed, declined to comment.The holiday stakesAt the core of Ames Watson's strategy to revive Claire's is improving its merchandise, which could become more difficult if the company has strained relationships with some suppliers. Compounding the problem is President Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs, which have already strained retail supply chains globally and raised costs for importers. Marshall, Claire's former CEO, said ensuring vendors in Asia got paid during the company's first bankruptcy was key to having the right products in place for the holiday season that year.\"These were suppliers where we had generational relationships and in many cases, represented 30, 40, 50% or even more of their total volume, and the intellectual capital that represented was core to the success of Claire's,\" Marshall said. \"There's a difference between having product on the shelves, which we could have done, and having the right product on the shelves.\"He said the disputes Claire's is having with its suppliers could \"disrupt the supply chain\" both now and moving forward, making a turnaround more difficult. \"There needs to be fresh, novel product to lure [customers] into the store, and if you don't have that continual replenishment of really exciting product, she's gonna pass you by,\" said Marshall. \"This is literally the most fickle customer in the world: an 8-year-old girl.\"",

    "body": "watch nowHigh home prices, stubbornly high mortgage rates and now less supply are all weighing on potential homebuyers. Sales of previously owned homes rose just 0.5% in November from October and were 1% lower than November 2024, according to the National Association of Realtors. Sales came in at an annualized rate of 4.13 million units.This count is based on closings, so it reflects contracts likely signed in September and October, when mortgage rates initially came down slightly but then stayed in a tight range.   Supply, which had been gaining for much of this year, fell in November. There were 1.43 million homes for sale at the end of the month, down 5.9% from October but up 7.5% year over year, according to the association. At the current sales pace, that represents a 4.2-month supply. A six-month supply is considered balanced between buyer and seller. \"Inventory growth is beginning to stall,\" Lawrence Yun, chief economist for the Realtors, said in a release. \"With distressed property sales at historic lows and housing wealth at an all-time high, homeowners are in no rush to list their properties during the winter months.\"Get Property Play directly to your inboxCNBC's Property Play with Diana Olick covers new and evolving opportunities for the real estate investor, delivered weekly to your inbox.Subscribe here to get access today.Sellers who were on the market also began to delist their properties at a higher rate than usual. Sellers often take unsold homes off the market heading into winter, but that dynamic was much stronger this year. And that is keeping pressure on home prices. The median price of a home sold in November was $409,200, an increase of 1.2% from November 2024, and the highest November reading on record. The Realtors use a median measurement, which can skew to what end of the market is selling most. The high end is currently doing much better than the low end. Sales of homes priced in the $100,000 to $250,000 range were down nearly 8% from a year ago, while homes priced at more than $1 million were up 1.4%.\"Wage growth is outpacing home price gains, which improves housing affordability. Still, future affordability could be hampered if housing supply fails to keep pace with demand,\" Yun said.Homes are staying on the market longer, at 36 days compared with 32 days last November. First-time homebuyers made up 30% of sales, unchanged from a year ago, but historically they make up about 40%. Investors stepped back into the market, making up 18% of transactions, up from 13% in November 2024.",

    "body": "Company: LKQ Corp. (LKQ)Business: LKQ engages in the distribution of replacement parts, components, and systems used in the repair and maintenance of vehicles and specialty vehicle aftermarket products and accessories. The company operates through four segments: wholesale-North America, Europe, specialty, and self service. It offers bumper covers, automotive body panels, and lights, as well as paint and paint-related consumables for refinishing vehicles; mechanical automotive parts and accessories; salvage products, including mechanical and collision parts comprising engines; transmissions; door assemblies; sheet metal products, such as trunk lids, fenders, and hoods; and lights and bumper assemblies. The company also provides scrap metal and other materials to metals recyclers; precious metals contained in certain of our recycled parts, such as catalytic converters; and brake pads, discs and sensors, clutches, steering and suspension products, filters, and oil and automotive fluids, as well as electrical products. It serves collision and mechanical repair shops, and new and used car dealerships, as well as retail customers. LKQ was incorporated in 1998 and is headquartered in Antioch, Tennessee.Stock Market Value: $7.66 billion ($30.15 per share)Activist: Ananym Capital ManagementOwnership: 0.39%Average Cost: n/aActivist Commentary: Ananym Capital Management is a New York-based activist investment firm which launched on Sept. 3, 2024, and is run by Charlie Penner (a former partner at JANA Partners and head of shareholder activism at Engine No. 1) and Alex Silver (a former partner and investment committee member at P2 Capital Partners). Ananym looks for high quality but undervalued companies, regardless of industry. They would prefer to work amicably with their portfolio companies but are willing to launch a proxy fight as a last resort. According to their most recent 13F filing, they manage $260 million across 10 positions.What's happeningOn Oct. 21, Ananym Capital called on LKQ to divest its European operations and refocus on its North American business.Behind the scenesLKQ is a leading distributor of aftermarket vehicle parts. Its core North America segment (40% of revenue and 55% of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) primarily supplies aftermarket collision parts, such as mirrors and bumpers. The Europe segment (47% of revenue/38% of EBITDA) primarily supplies mechanical and suspension products but contains a wide variety of other replacement and maintenance products. Although the European business is slightly larger by revenue, the North American business has significantly higher margins and a much larger market share compared with its peers. Lastly, the specialty segment (13% of revenue/7% of EBITDA) provides aftermarket parts for the RV market. Originally just a U.S. aftermarket parts business, the company began aggressively pursuing acquisitions in Europe starting in 2011, shifting from a focus on recycled parts consolidation to building and integrating a European footprint. Moreover, these two businesses are not nearly as similar as they sound, in North America they do primarily aftermarket collision parts like mirrors and bumpers and in Europe, it's primarily mechanical suspension and things under the hood.LKQ is no stranger to shareholder activism. In September 2019, when the stock was trading at $27 per share, ValueAct Capital engaged the company and settled for a board seat for one of its partners. Through this campaign, ValueAct was able to usher in a new wave of operational discipline, where instead of focusing on European M&A, LKQ paused large acquisitions and shifted its focus to growing the company's free cash flow and executing buybacks at an attractive discount. The results of this campaign speak for themselves, as LKQ's share price rose to over $60 during ValueAct's campaign, giving them an 86.39% return on their investment versus 16.15% for the Russell 2000. However, following ValueAct's exit, LKQ returned to its old ways, shifting their focus back to M&A, and the stock had subsequently declined more than 25% by February 2025, when two new activists entered the stock. In an uninspired campaign and settlement, those activists quickly settled for two board seats for independent directors and the stock has declined by 20% in the eight months since while the Russell 2000 has been up more than 7% during the same time.Now with the stock just slightly higher than it was in 2019 when ValueAct engaged, a third activist has entered to take over where ValueAct had left off, calling on LKQ to divest its European operations and refocus on its North American business. LKQ has always been a company that has benefited from simplification and harmed by complexity – and Ananym's plan seems to align with this approach: (i) halt major M&A, (i) divest the European business and other non-core assets, and (iii) use the proceeds to fund buybacks and reinvest in organic growth in the core NA segment. Operationally, there are several benefits to Ananym's plan. While the U.S. functions as a single market with consistent regulations, Europe is a series of nation states each with their own regulatory framework, making integration far more complex. This creates meaningful execution risks, exemplified by the company still needing to integrate more than 20 ERP systems in 18 different countries. Not only would divesting Europe leave the company with a higher margin business with a much larger relative market share, but it would also allow management to devote all their time and resources to North America. The alternative is to continue to focus a disproportionate amount of time on integrating all the European acquisitions across the different European countries all from their headquarters in Chicago and Nashville.The opportunity here is also clear from a valuation perspective. Industrial distribution peers typically trade at mid-teens or higher EBITDA multiples, while LKQ currently trades at 7.3x forward EBITDA. Not only is this a discount to the market, but to its historical levels, as even in its messy conglomerate form, LKQ has still traded on a 10-year historical average of 10x EBITDA. The European business could potentially be sold at an 8 to 9x multiple, but a sale even at the company's current multiple would be beneficial to unlocking value in the North American business, which could re-rate to its historical multiple of 10x EBITDA. The proceeds from such a sale could enable LKQ to repurchase up to 40% of its outstanding shares, which, when combined with the re-rating of NA, could easily translate to more than 60% upside from the company's current share price. While strategics with similar models, such as O'Reilly, AutoZone, and Genuine Parts, may find the European business appealing, strategics generally prefer clean businesses and this is far from that. Private equity, on the other hand, feasts on these types of projects, using their operational and restructuring expertise and flexibility of being out of the public eye to unlock these complex assets overtime in a way that is more difficult for public companies to address.In its short history, Ananym has established a reputation for striving to work amicably with management to create value for shareholders, and this situation appears to be no different. The fund has been largely complimentary of LKQ CEO Justin Jude who was named to the position in July 2024 and has his roots in the North American business. Under his short leadership, the company has already taken steps in the right direction — announcing plans to repurchase 14% of outstanding shares and divesting non-core assets such as its self-service salvage business that was sold in August to private equity. It has also signaled that its specialty business is on the market and it's expected to be sold in the near term. However, Jude seems to be a little more attached to the European business than these other businesses. Persuading him to divest Europe may take a little more time. If we learned anything from the previous activist campaigns at LKQ, this company needs a financially astute shareholder representative, not an independent industry executive. They do not need someone to help them with operations, they need someone to help them financially model, evaluate and potentially execute strategic options and work with the board to arrive at what is best for shareholders. Given Ananym's reputation as an amicable activist and their constructive relationship with Jude thus far, we think this is a perfect opportunity to put an Ananym representative on the board like Alex Silver who has extensive financial and private equity experience and brings a team of analysts ready to model available opportunities.Ken Squire is the founder and president of 13D Monitor, an institutional research service on shareholder activism, and the founder and portfolio manager of the 13D Activist Fund, a mutual fund that invests in a portfolio of activist investments.",

    "body": "watch nowBuild-A-Bear Workshop wasn't always a retail winner.The toy store, known for its interactive experience of building and accessorizing stuffed animals, has gone through a significant turnaround since CEO Sharon Price John took the helm of the company over a decade ago.\"When I first came in 2013, that assessment of the brand was strong,\" she told CNBC. \"We don't have a broken brand, we have a broken business, and when you started doing interviews, you really understood how much this brand meant to people.\"The company found initial success in malls in the early 2000s, but Build-A-Bear's stock plunged after the 2008 financial crisis, with the company reporting a $49 million loss in fiscal 2012.Under Price John, the company began investing in e-commerce, shifting orders to stores instead of its distribution center and diversifying its sales beyond just malls to turn around the company.\"Our goal overall was to create sustained, profitable growth, but the profitable was first,\" Price John said.That strategy worked. Virtually all of Build-A-Bear's stores are now profitable, and the stock experienced an Nvidia-like run earlier this year, hitting an all-time high of about $76 in September. The stock has come down some since then, but it's still up more than 125% over the past two years.But tariffs have taken a hit to the business. Build-A-Bear imports over 90% of its products from China and Vietnam, and the company said in its third-quarter earnings report in early December that it expects to take a roughly $11 million hit from tariffs for fiscal 2025.Company executives also said on a call with analysts that the company experienced a slowdown in traffic in October during the government shutdown.Small Cap Consumer Research analyst Eric Beder wrote in a note this month that the firm was lowering projections and reducing its price target by $10 due to the company reporting lighter-than-expected revenue and the \"implied deep tariff impacts.\"Still, the company is outperforming most of its retail competitors, expecting to reach $500 million in annual revenue for the first time.\"You can buy stuffed animals or a plush pretty much everywhere, right from Target to FAO Schwarz and every place in between,\" Beder told CNBC. \"The difference is that at Build-A-Bear, it's yours. You helped make it.\"Watch the video to learn more about how Build-A-Bear has made its comeback.",

Juliet, Tennessee, on October 9, 2024.Seth Herald | Afp | Getty ImagesStarbucks announced Friday that it has hired its new chief technology officer, Amazon veteran Anand Varadarajan. Varadarajan, who spent nearly 19 years at Amazon, most recently led technology and supply chain for the tech giant's worldwide grocery stores business.Varadarajan, who also previously held software engineering roles at Oracle, will begin Jan. 19 as executive vice president and CTO, reporting directly to CEO Brian Niccol, according to a memo. The hire comes after Deb Hall Lefevre, Starbucks' former CTO, departed in September as the company underwent a second round of layoffs and announced a $1 billion restructuring plan as a part of its ongoing turnaround. \"[Varadarajan] knows how to create systems that are reliable and secure, drive operational excellence and scale solutions that keep customers at the center. Just as important, he cares deeply about supporting and developing the people behind the scenes that build and enable the technology we use,\" Niccol wrote in a memo announcing the hiring. At Amazon, Varadarajan had recently been elevated to oversee the worldwide grocery technology and supply chain organizations, which include both its homegrown Fresh brand and Whole Foods. He reported directly to Jason Buechel, Amazon's grocery chief and the CEO of Whole Foods. During his tenure, Amazon has experimented further with grocery tech innovations like a pilot to incorporate mini robotic warehouses in Whole Foods supermarkets that enable consumers to shop both its in-store selection and products from Amazon's wider inventory that aren't typically stocked by the organic grocer.Starbucks, meanwhile, is still in the early stages of a turnaround overseen by Niccol, who took over as CEO in September 2024. In the most recent quarter, Starbucks' quarterly same-store sales returned to growth for the first time in nearly two years, a sign that its strategy is winning over lapsed customers. Holiday sales have also been strong so far this season as the company contends with an ongoing strike of unionized baristas impacting a small number of its stores.Part of that strategy is its hospitality platform, Green Apron Service, which at $500 million is the company's largest investment into labor. The program is backed by changes to ensure proper staffing and better technology to keep service times fast. It was born out of growth in digital orders — which now make up more than 30% of sales — and feedback from baristas.watch now— CNBC's Annie Palmer contributed to this report",

    "body": "U.S. President Donald Trump speaks during an event in the Roosevelt Room of the White House December 19, 2025 in Washington, DC. Trump delivered remarks on lowering prescription drug prices during the event. Alex Wong | Getty ImagesSeveral of the largest U.S. and European-based drugmakers inked deals with President Donald Trump on Friday to voluntarily sell their medications for less, as his administration pushes to link the nation's drug prices to cheaper ones abroad.That includes Merck, Bristol Myers Squibb, Amgen, Gilead, GSK, Sanofi, Roche's Genentech, privately-held Boehringer Ingelheim and Novartis. In exchange, the companies agreed to a three-year grace period during which their products won't face Trump's planned pharmaceutical-specific tariffs — as long as the drugmakers further invest in U.S. manufacturing. Among the most notable pledges on Friday is that Bristol Myers Squibb will offer Eliquis, its blockbuster blood thinner and top-prescribed product, for free to Medicaid.The companies make up the majority of the 17 drugmakers Trump sent letters to in July, calling on them to lower prices as part of his \"most favored nation\" policy. Trump signed an executive order in May to revive that policy, calling for prices to be increased outside of the U.S. and to \"end global freeloading.\"\"As of today, 14 out of the 17 largest pharmaceutical companies ... have now agreed to drastically lower drug prices for … the American people and the American patients,\" Trump said at an event on Friday. \"This represents the greatest victory for patient affordability in the history of American health care, by far, and every single American will benefit.\"Johnson & Johnson, AbbVie and Regeneron are the remaining companies among the largest that haven't signed drug pricing deals. But Trump noted that Johnson & Johnson \"will be here next week.\" How the drug pricing deals will workThe full terms of the deals were not immediately released, which makes it unclear how broad their impact will be.The nine drugmakers agreed to take measures to reduce U.S. drug prices, including selling their existing treatments to Medicaid patients at the lowest \"most favored nation\" prices, and guaranteeing that pricing for new medicines. Trump said the drugmakers also agreed to list their most popular drugs on his upcoming direct-to-consumer website, TrumpRx, which is launching in January. Some companies also launched new or expanded existing direct-to-consumer offerings for certain drugs. For example, Gilead said in a release that it will launch a program that will enable patients to access its hepatitis C treatment and cure, Epclusa, at a discounted price. Sanofi said it will offer discounts of nearly 70% on certain medicines to treat infections and cardiovascular and diabetic conditions on TrumpRx and other direct-to-consumer platforms. Merck said it will offer three diabetes medications, Januvia, Janumet and Janumet XR, at a roughly 70% discount to cash-paying patients through a direct-to-patient program. That program will be extended to the company's experimental daily cholesterol pill if it gets approved in the U.S., according to the company. \"I reflect on your goal of driving affordability and access to Americans, but equally, getting prices up outside the United States,\" Merck CEO Robert Davis said during the press conference. \"And we're 100% supportive of your actions.\" Meanwhile, Amgen will expand its existing direct-to-patient program to include preventative migraine medication Aimovig and autoimmune treatment Amjevita, at 60% and 80% discounted monthly prices, respectively. Earlier this year, Trump announced agreements with Eli Lilly, Novo Nordisk, Pfizer, AstraZeneca and EMD Serono to sell certain drugs directly to patients at a discount, in exchange for exemptions from his planned pharmaceutical tariffs and other benefits, such as fast-tracked reviews of new drugs. U.S. prescription drug prices on average are nearly three times higher than overseas, according to a 2024 study by Rand Corp. Prices for branded drugs were more than four times higher, the report found. Trump signed an executive order in May to revive the policy of most favored nation, calling for prices to be increased outside of the U.S. and to \"end global freeloading.\"Trade association PhRMA, which represents many major pharma companies, has said that most-favored nation pricing isn't the best way to lower drug costs for Americans and instead blamed pharmacy benefit managers for the price disparity. The U.S. is the single most important market for many drugmakers, regardless of their home country. Despite being based across the Atlantic, European pharma companies are heavily exposed to the U.S. market, with half of the 10 largest companies on the Continent generating a majority of their sales in the U.S.",

    "body": "Global data centers dealmaking surged to hit another record high this year, driven by a rush to build out the infrastructure required for energy-intensive AI workloads.That surge came even as investors grew increasingly wary of inflated artificial intelligence valuations and the financing underpinning the rapid expansion of data centers. Global stocks sold off in November as worries of an AI-fueled bubble persisted.But S&P Global reported that more than $61 billion has flowed into the data center market this year, up slightly from $60.8 billion last year, amid what it called a \"global construction frenzy.\"A surge in debt financing contributed to the record high as hyperscalers increasingly tap private equity markets rather than funding the expensive infrastructure themselves. That trend has sparked concerns from some investors as they question the value of the advanced tech that data centers house.Shares of cloud company Oracle fell 5% on Wednesday following a report that Blue Owl Capital was pulling out of a deal to back a $10 billion data center in Michigan. Oracle has denied the report, but Broadcom, Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices retreated after it was published. The Nasdaq Composite lost 1.81% in its worst day in nearly a month.Iuri Struta, TMT analyst at S&P Global Market Intelligence, said his team expects market concerns around AI and Oracle to be temporary and unlikely to have a \"massive impact\" on data center buildout and M&A in the near future.\"The competitive dynamic among frontier AI model providers, like OpenAI, Alphabet and Anthropic, is changing quickly, and this can have an impact on investor sentiment in public markets. But overall, we see demand for AI applications continuing to grow strongly in 2026.\"watch nowDespite the recent pullback in AI stocks, many analysts remain bullish on the sector. ING expects secular trends to point to healthy investment levels in 2026 driven by AI advancements and growing public and private support for digital innovation.\"There are two sides to the development of AI, one that would cater for optimism such as faster development of medicine and at the same time there would be concerns typically around (public) safety,\" Wim Steenbakkers, global head of datacenters and technology at ING, told CNBC.\"Hence uncertainty remains around the monetisation of the technology and business models. Questions around the high levels of investment will only be answered in the future when the uncertainties diminish and the applications of the technology and its advantages become clearer.\"There were more than 100 data center transactions in the first 11 months of the year, whose total value already exceeds all the deals done in 2024, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence data. The majority of those deals took place in the U.S., followed by the Asia-Pacific region.\"In Europe, the buildout of data centers is expected to grow at a lower rate than other regions, but it remains to be seen if this results in an M&A rush amid scarcity of assets,\" Struta said.The pace of growth in the U.S. is leaving Europe \"in the dust\" according to a recent report from ING which predicted data center investment in the U.S. could be fivefold higher. Growth is also increasingly coming from the Middle East, as the wealthy Gulf States look to position themselves as the next global AI hub.Debt issuance nearly doubles in 2025Debt issuance nearly doubled to $182 billion in 2025, up from $92 billion last year, according to the data from S&P. It noted that Meta and Google were among the most active issuers, with Facebook's owner raising $62 billion in debt since 2022 — nearly half of that total was issued in 2025 alone.Google and Amazon raised $29 billion and $15 billion, respectively, according to the report, which noted that hyperscalers are increasingly working with AI labs to buy assets to finance construction in an \"unusual arrangement\" that underscores the significant capital required to meet demand.Struta expects more \"robust\" M&A investment activity in the data center space in 2026.\"I wouldn't be surprised if already high valuations get even higher,\" he told CNBC. \"The buildout of new data centers can be temporarily tempered by a lack of energy supply, making already built data centers more valuable. As the availability of large data center companies remains scarce, we could see more asset sales by companies that don't view data centers as their core business.\"",

    "body": "watch nowElon Musk's 2018 CEO pay package from Tesla, worth some $56 billion when it vested, must be restored, the Delaware Supreme Court ruled Friday.\"We reverse the Court of Chancery's rescission remedy and award $1 in nominal damages,\" the judges wrote in their opinion. In the decision, the Delaware Supreme Court judges said a lower court's decision to cancel Musk's 2018 pay plan was too extreme a remedy and that the lower court did not give Tesla a chance to say what a fair compensation ought to be.The decision on the appeal in this case, known as Tornetta v. Musk, likely ends the yearslong fight over Musk's record-setting compensation. Musk's net worth is currently estimated at around $679.4 billion, according to the Forbes Real Time Billionaires List. Dorothy Lund, a professor at Columbia Law School, told CNBC that while the Friday opinion may restore the 2018 pay plan for Musk, it leaves the rest of the lower court's decision unaddressed and intact. \"The court had previously decided that Musk was a controlling shareholder of Tesla and that the Tesla board and he arranged an unfair pay plan for him,\" she said. \"None of that was reversed in this decision.\"\"We are proud to have participated in the historic verdict below, calling to account the Tesla board and its largest stockholder for their breaches of fiduciary duty,\" lawyers representing plaintiff Richard J. Tornetta said in an e-mailed statement.Tesla did not immediately respond to requests for comment.The Delaware Supreme Court issued the order per curiam with no single judge taking credit for writing the opinion and no dissent noted.Read more CNBC tech newsGoogle and Nvidia VC arms back vibe coding startup Lovable at $6.6 billion valuationMetaX and Moore Threads' IPOs underscore Chinese chipmakers' growing challenge to NvidiaInstacart shares drop on report that FTC is probing company over AI pricing toolAmazon says AI chief Rohit Prasad is leaving, Peter DeSantis to lead 'AGI' groupMusk's 2018 CEO pay package from Tesla, comprised of 12 milestone-based tranches of stock, was unprecedented at the time it was proposed. After it was granted, the pay plan made Musk the wealthiest individual in the world.Tesla shareholder Tornetta sued Tesla, filing a derivative action in 2018, accusing Musk and the company's board of a breach of their fiduciary duties. Delaware's business-specialized Court of Chancery decided in January 2024 that the pay plan was improperly granted and ordered it to be rescinded.In her decision, Chancellor Kathaleen McCormick also found that Musk \"controlled Tesla,\" and that the process leading to the board's approval of his 2018 pay plan was \"deeply flawed.\" Among other things, she found the Tesla board did not disclose all the material information they should have to investors before asking them to vote on and approve the plan.After the earlier Tornetta ruling, Musk moved Tesla's site of incorporation out of Delaware, bashed McCormick by name in posts on his social network X, formerly Twitter, where he has tens of millions of followers, and called for other entrepreneurs to reincorporate outside of the state.Tesla also attempted to \"ratify\" the 2018 CEO pay plan by holding a second vote with shareholders in 2024. In November, Tesla shareholders voted to approve an even larger CEO compensation plan for Musk. The 2025 pay plan consists of 12 tranches of shares to be granted to the CEO if Tesla hits certain milestones over the next decade and is worth about $1 trillion in total. The new plan could also increase Musk's voting power over the company from around 13% today to around 25%. Shareholders had also approved a plan to replace Musk's 2018 CEO pay if the Tornetta decision was upheld on appeal. That plan is now nullified.As CNBC previously reported, a law firm that currently represents Tesla in this appeal penned a bill to overhaul corporate law in Delaware earlier this year. The bill was passed by the Delaware legislature in March, and if it had applied retroactively, it could have affected the outcome of this case.Read the Delaware Supreme Court's ruling here. watch now",

    "body": "watch nowCNBC's Jim Cramer on Friday explained how he thinks the data center sector can regain its footing on the market, saying OpenAI needs to raise cash to pay Oracle, one of its major partners.\"No matter what, OpenAI needs to raise a lot of money, and it needs to raise it now,\" he said. \"Or else the whole data center edifice will go down and stay down.\"While artificial intelligence stocks managed to rally on Friday — with the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite gaining 1.31% — the group has been under pressure in recent months as Wall Street scrutinizes hyperscalers' massive infrastructure spending. Oracle and OpenAI in particular have raised eyebrows, as the ChatGPT maker committed to pay more than $300 billion to the software company. Cramer suggested investors grew concerned after Oracle raised $18 billion in its September bond sale — one of the largest debt issuances on record in the tech industry.OpenAI should \"strike while the iron's hot and try to raise $200 billion at a trillion dollar valuation,\" Cramer said. That funding will allow the company to pay Oracle the money it needs now to build data centers, he continued. If that happens, he said, other hyperscalers will have to keep spending on infrastructure, and data centers stocks can take off.Cramer said he's fairly optimistic OpenAI can raise the money. But the outfit has \"monster hubris,\" he continued, and suggested now could be a \"humbling moment\" for the company, or it could \"demonstrate that they're right to be arrogant.\"\"Even if OpenAI raises, say $100 billion now in a private round and then comes back for a public round for another $100 billion next year, the data center theme could continue to hum,\" he said. \"Of course, if Open AI can't raise enough money, then we just reverse everything we saw today, and we go back down.\"OpenAI and Oracle did not immediately respond to request for comment.watch now",

    "body": "U.S. financier Jeffrey Epstein appears in a photograph taken for the New York State Division of Criminal Justice Services' sex offender registry March 28, 2017 and obtained by Reuters July 10, 2019.New York State Division of Criminal Justice Services | Handout | ReutersThe Department of Justice on Friday released some — but not all — of its investigative files about Jeffrey Epstein, the notorious sex predator.The release came on the deadline set by the recently signed Epstein Files Transparency Act for the DOJ to release all of the files.Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., who led the effort that forced a vote on the bill that became that law, said that the DOJ's production of the files \"grossly fails to comply with both the spirit and the letter of the law.\"The DOJ's website features a new page titled \"Epstein Library,\" which has a search box to look for keywords in the newly released files.The material included hundreds of photographs, some of which featured Epstein and his former girlfriend and convicted accomplice, Ghislaine Maxwell, as well as images that appeared to show parts of his home and other locations. Epstein died in a jailhouse suicide in 2019. Maxwell is serving a 20-year prison term for crimes related to her procuring underage girls for him to sexually abuse.It was not immediately clear how much of the released material was not previously publicly available through other sources.The search box did not immediately appear to work, as searches for words including \"Epstein\" generated a message saying: \"No results found. Please try a different search.\"\"This site houses materials responsive under the Epstein Files Transparency Act,\" the site says. \"This site will be updated if additional documents are identified for release.\"In a letter to members of Congress detailing the partial release, Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said the material included evidence collected in a 2018 criminal probe of Epstein by the FBI; a 2019 probe of Maxwell; \"the FBI Miami investigative file for the 2006 Epstein criminal case for child prostitution; the FBI Miami, the FBI New York investigative file for the 2019 Epstein death investigation;\" as well as court records from civil and criminal cases involving Epstein, Maxwell and the Epstein estate.Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., said Friday that Congress could hold impeachment hearings about Attorney General Pam Bondi and Blanche if the released documents do not meet the law's requirements. \"What we need is a clear timeline of when the rest of the documents will be released and an explanation for why they did not release all of them today,\" Khanna said at a press conference after the DOJ posted the documents.Several photos showed former President Bill Clinton, including one featuring a smiling Clinton with a young woman wearing a white tank top perched on the arm of his chair.

A third photo features Clinton and Epstein wearing shiny dress shirts.It was not clear when any of the photos were taken or their locations. CNBC did not alter the photos.Clinton has not been accused of wrongdoing in connection with Epstein.His spokesman, Angel Urena, more than six years ago said, \"President Clinton knows nothing about the terrible crimes Jeffrey Epstein pleaded guilty to in Florida some years ago, or those with which he has been recently charged in New York.\"On Friday, Urena responded to the files being released with a post on X.\"The White House hasn't been hiding these files for months only to dump them late on a Friday to protect Bill Clinton,\" Urena wrote. \"This is about shielding themselves from what comes next, or from what they'll try and hide forever. So they can release as many grainy 20-plus-year-old photos as they want but this isn't about Bill Clinton.\"\"There are two types of people here. The first group knew nothing and cut Epstein off before his crimes came to light,\" Urena said. \" The second group continued relationships with him after. We're in the first. No amount of stalling by people in the second group will change that. Everyone, especially MAGA, expects answers, not scapegoats.\"In a 1997 photo, Jeffrey Epstein, left, and Donald Trump pose together at the Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Florida.Davidoff Studios Photography | Archive Photos | Getty ImagesAmong the documents released Friday was an address book, which included a listing for President Donald Trump, who had been a friend of Epstein's for years before they had falling out in the early 2000s. The address book appears to be identical or substantially similar to an address book of Epstein's that was previously made public.Trump has not been accused of wrongdoing in connection with Epstein and has denied being aware of Epstein's serial sexual abuse of underage girls and women.The released files were notably light on images showing Trump, in contrast to the multiple images of Clinton. Trump is seen in images recently released by congressional Democrats after they were obtained from Epstein's estate.One photo that was released by the DOJ on Friday shows an array of photos and other items. Trump's face can be seen in an image that is among those photos.Photo from the Jeffrey Epstein files released by the U.S. Justice Department shows photos with prominent people including a Pope, Bill Clinton, and Donald Trump.U.S. Department of JusticeBlanche, the deputy attorney general, earlier Friday told Fox News, \"I expect that we're going to release several hundred thousand documents today.\"\"I expect that we're going to release more documents over the next couple of weeks, so today several hundred thousand, and then over the next couple weeks,\" Blanche said. \"I expect several hundred thousand more.\"Blanche said the DOJ was reviewing each file to redact names and identities of Epstein's victims.Photo from the Jeffrey Epstein files released by the U.S. Justice Department showing Bill Clinton and Jeffrey Epstein. Date and context is unclear.U.S. Department of Justice\"There's a lot of eyes looking at these, and we want to make sure that when we do produce the materials that we're producing, that we're protecting every single victim,\" he said.White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson, in a statement, said, \"The Trump Administration is the most transparent in history.\"\"By releasing thousands of pages of documents, cooperating with the House Oversight Committee's subpoena request, and President Trump recently calling for further investigations into Epstein's Democrat friends, the Trump Administration has done more for the victims than Democrats ever have.\"\"And while President Trump is delivering on his promises, Democrats like Hakeem Jeffries and Stacey Plaskett have yet to explain why they were soliciting money and meetings from Epstein after he was a convicted sex offender,\" Jackson said. \"The American people deserve answers.\"Photo from the Jeffrey Epstein files released by the U.S. Justice Department shows Bill Clinton in a hot tub with an unknown person.

Date and context is unclear.U.S. Department of JusticeDemocrats in Congress slammed the partial release plan and Trump.\"Donald Trump and the Department of Justice are now violating federal law,\" Rep. Robert Garcia and Jamie Raskin said in a joint statement. \"We are now examining all legal options in the face of this violation of federal law.\"Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer blasted the DOJ, Blanche, and Attorney General Pam Bondi after the interview, saying, \"This is nothing more than a cover up to protect Donald Trump from his ugly past.\"\"The law Congress passed and President Trump signed was clear as can be — the Trump administration had 30 days to release ALL the Epstein files, not just some,\" Schumer said in a statement.\"Failing to do so is breaking the law. This just shows the Department of Justice, Donald Trump, and Pam Bondi are hellbent on hiding the truth,\" he said.The text of the Epstein Files law says: \"Not later than 30 days after the date of enactment of this Act, the Attorney General shall, subject to subsection (b), make publicly available in a searchable and downloadable format all unclassified records, documents, communications, and investigative materials in the possession of the Department of Justice, including the Federal Bureau of Investigation and United States Attorneys' Offices, that relate to: (1) Jeffrey Epstein including all investigations, prosecutions, or custodial matters. (2) Ghislaine Maxwell.\"CNBC is reaching out to the people identified in the photos or mentioned in the latest release of the Epstein files. This article will be updated with their responses.A person being mentioned in the release of documents and photos does not imply any wrongdoing.Blanche is the second-highest-ranking DOJ official, after Bondi. Blanche previously served as a criminal defense lawyer for Trump.Garcia, D-Calif., and the Maryland Democrat Raskin, in their joint statement, said, \"For months, Pam Bondi has denied survivors the transparency and accountability they have demanded and deserve and has defied the Oversight Committee's subpoena.\"\"The Department of Justice is now making clear it intends to defy Congress itself, even as it gives star treatment to Epstein's convicted co-conspirator, Ghislaine Maxwell,\" they said, referring to the fact that Maxwell was transferred to a less restrictive federal prison earlier this year after sitting for a two-day interview with Blanche.The files' ordered release comes after months of controversy over the Trump administration's decision to renege on past promises by top law enforcement officials to make the documents and other evidence public.In November, Congress overwhelmingly voted to compel the DOJ to release the Epstein files, and Trump signed that legislation despite having urged Republicans in Congress to oppose it.Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche speaks during a press conference with President Donald Trump in the Oval Office of the White House, in Washington, DC, October 15, 2025. Andrew Caballero-Reynolds | Afp | Getty ImagesTrump, who had been friends with Epstein for years before the two men had a falling out in the early 2000s, had called demands to release the files a Democratic \"hoax.\"But some of the leading voices in favor of making the documents public were his fellow Republicans. Trump has never been accused of wrongdoing in connection with Epstein and has denied having been aware of Epstein's serial sexual abuse of underage girls and young women over the years.The files set to be released are related to federal investigations of Epstein over many years.The first of those probes ended in 2008, when he agreed to plead guilty to state charges in Florida related to prostitution of a person under age 18. The deal allowed him to avoid harsher federal charges.

Based on the story, it is likely the apartment has at least two bedrooms, according to Cody Garrett, a certified financial planner at Measure Twice Financial in Houston.Today, a two-bedroom apartment at that location would cost around $2 million, Garrett estimates, with a mortgage payment of around $10,000 per month before taxes, insurance and maintenance.Read more CNBC personal finance coverageTrump promises 'largest tax refund season of all time.'

The median asking rent for a two-bedroom, two-bathroom apartment in that same ZIP code is $9,175 per month as of November and $8,400 per month more broadly on the Upper West Side, according to StreetEasy, a New York City real estate search website owned by Zillow.Meanwhile, the median asking price for a two-bedroom, two-bathroom apartment is around $2.5 million as of November and almost $2.2 million on the Upper West Side, according to StreetEasy data. To rent or buy? New York City Madison Square park view with Christmas lights and Manhattan skyscrapers.Getty ImagesThe question \"Should I buy or should I rent?\" is increasingly relevant today.Renting is cheaper than paying a mortgage in all 50 of the largest U.S. metropolitan areas, according to an April Bankrate study. That cost difference has grown in 38 metro areas in the past year, Bankrate's research found. Yet, New York does not top the list for the biggest difference between renting and buying. Instead, cities including San Francisco; San Jose, California; Seattle; Denver; and Salt Lake City are in the top five. There are reasons why buying can be more financially challenging. Rising home prices have outpaced rent increases in many markets, while mortgage rates have also climbed. Housing supply can also be an issue, with not enough homes available for aspiring purchasers.Emotions may also factor into the buying vs. renting trade-off. For some, buying can offer a sense of security. Others may prefer the reduced responsibility for upkeep that renting provides.\"I actually consider a primary residence to be a lifestyle decision, not an investment,\" Garrett said.To help clients gauge housing affordability, Garrett said he refers to the 28/36 rule. That means no more than 28% of gross monthly income should go to housing costs, and total debt including housing should be no more than 36% of monthly gross income. Monthly homeownership costs are typically measured by PITI — the sum of mortgage principal, interest, taxes and insurance.The fictitious couple Walter and Emily Hobbs in the \"Elf\" movie would need gross income exceeding $450,000 to justify buying the property, according to Garrett. Walter is an executive at a children's book publisher, while Emily also has an unspecified high-level job. Even if they meet that income threshold for home ownership, they may still be squeezed by saving and planning for retirement, Garrett said. Moreover, their son Michael attends York Preparatory school, where annual tuition and fees currently run around nearly $68,000 for grades six through 12.Garrett recently worked with a client who purchased a home in the same neighborhood for around $15,000 per month. Ahead of the purchase, Garrett cautioned the client about how the high home costs could require sacrifice in other aspects of life, including pushing their targeted retirement date later.The \"Elf\" movie has other lessons when it comes to cost of living, particularly for the character Jovie, who works at Gimbels department store and lives in Chinatown.Because it appears she is living paycheck to paycheck, she likely isn't saving for retirement or emergencies, Garrett said, which is common among people who move to New York in search of success. As Leon the snowman tells Buddy when he leaves the North Pole for New York, \"This might be the golden opportunity to find out who you really are.\"Those who move to New York or other big metro areas with similar aspirations may take steps to try to defray the high cost of living, Garrett said. For example, to ease her financial situation, Jovie may find roommates or additional streams of income, he said. ",

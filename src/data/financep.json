    "body": "watch nowStock Chart IconStock chart iconTilray Brands, 1-dayPresident Donald Trump is expected to issue an executive order as soon as Monday that would allow for reclassification of marijuana, a person familiar with the matter told CNBC. The person asked not to be named because they are not authorized to speak about the White House's plans.Such a move would allow cannabis companies to fall under different tax regulations and encourage investment.Cannabis stocks took a leg up in Friday's midday trading following CNBC's report.The Washington Post first reported Thursday that Trump was expected to use an executive order to instruct federal agencies to reclassify marijuana as a less-regulated Schedule III drug from a Schedule I. Axios reported that the potential reclassification of marijuana — out of a group that includes heroin and into a lower tier of less dangerous drugs, such as steroids and Tylenol with codeine — would take place early next year.Trump floated a change in marijuana's classification in August.\"Trump rescheduling marijuana was not an if, in our assessment, but a when,\" Ed Groshans of Compass Point, a middle-market investment bank, wrote to clients in a Friday note.More optimismGroshans said the reported change would be \"positive\" for the cannabis industry, allowing banks to serve the sector.He said he expects that if Trump orders cannabis to be rescheduled, the Drug Enforcement Administration would finalize a proposed rule for the reclassification by the summer.Bill Kirk, senior research analyst at Roth, said he's also monitoring whether the Supreme Court decides next week to hear a case on state regulations and federal prohibition of cannabis. A positive ruling for the industry in that case could speed up regulatory timelines.The industry sees the latest moves as a sign of progress to normalize pot under national law.\"I'm a lot more optimistic than I ever have been,\" Tilray CEO Irwin Simon told CNBC. Shawn Hauser, partner at cannabis-focused law firm Vicente LLP, said a reclassification would mark only a \"partial victory,\" as the sector will need to continue fighting for legalization. However, she said the momentum can press Congress to create a regulatory framework that offers broader changes around safety, access and criminal justice reform than what a rescheduling provides.\"This [is] the beginning of a new era of public health policy,\" Hauser said. \"If implemented, it dismantles nearly a century of outdated drug policies that fly in the face of science and medicine.\"Pot stocks have struggled since a brief mania around public growers and dispensaries in the years before Covid, even as cannabis has received broader acceptance and some states have eased their classifications.Tilray shares were recently trading at a little more than $10 after peaking at more than $2,140, adjusted for splits, in September 2018.

    "body": "Kevin Warsh, former governor of the US Federal Reserve, speaks with CNBC on July 17, 2025.CNBCPresident Donald Trump said Friday that Kevin Warsh has moved to the top of his list as the next Federal Reserve chair, though others remain in contention, according to the Wall Street Journal.Previously considered on Trump's short list but not the favorite, Warsh, a former Fed governor himself, apparently ingratiated himself further following an interview Wednesday with the president.\"Yes, I think he is,\" Trump told the paper when asked if Warsh was at the top, according to an account posted Friday afternoon.Referring to National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett, whom prediction markets previously had projected as the favorite, Trump said, \"I think you have Kevin and Kevin. They're both — I think the two Kevins are great.\"\"I think there are a couple of other people that are great,\" the president added.Hassett emerged as the lead candidate following a Bloomberg News report. Publicly, he has been demure when asked about the prospect of taking the job, saying only he would serve if asked. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), said Thursday on CNBC that she worried Trump would appoint a \"sock puppet\" as Fed chair to do his bidding.In addition to putting heavier weight on Warsh getting the job, Trump repeated an assertion he has made in the past that the Fed chair ought to consult the president about interest rate decisions.\"Typically, that's not done anymore. It used to be done routinely. It should be done,\" he said. \"I'm a smart voice and should be listened to.\"Trump has been at odds with the current chair, Jerome Powell, almost from the moment he nominated him for the position in 2017. Often resorting to name-calling and personal insults, Trump has badgered the Fed to lower interest rates, dissatisfied even with the current pace of cuts that has seen the central bank lop off three-quarters of a percentage point from its key rate since September. The Fed most recently cut Wednesday, taking the benchmark federal funds rate down to a range of 3.5%-3.75%, which Trump thinks should be even lower.Trump noted that Warsh largely agrees with his stance on monetary policy.\"He thinks you have to lower interest rates,\" Trump said. \"And so does everybody else that I've talked to.\"Prediction markets moved following the Journal report. Previously giving Hassett about a 71% chance of the nomination, that slipped to 62%, with Warsh at 36%, according to Kalshi.Trump did leave enough space to change his mind, noting that he has several good candidates in front of him.\"I think I have somebody that I like the best,\" he said. \"I like all of them, but I want to be careful because I was given a bad recommendation\" when he named Powell to the spot.Over the year, Trump repeatedly has blamed former Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin for recommending Powell. Current Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has led the current search. Trump has made no secret that he'd prefer Bessent to take on the role, but the Treasury chief has said repeatedly he is not interested.Other candidates considered included current Governors Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman along with Rick Rieder, who runs the fixed income operation at money management giant BlackRock. They were the last of a group of 11 candidates considered for the post.Powell's term expires in May, having been reappointed to the position by former President Joe Biden.Asked at his Wednesday news conference about his legacy, Powell said, \"I really want to turn this job over to whoever replaces me ... with the economy in really good shape. That's what I want to do.\"",

Date and context is unclear.Source: Democrats on the House Oversight Committee.Nearly 100,000 photos obtained by House Democrats from the estate of notorious sex predator Jeffrey Epstein include images of President Donald Trump, former President Bill Clinton, Microsoft founder Bill Gates, film director Woody Allen, and former Trump White House advisor Steve Bannon and others in social settings.Democrats on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, as they made 19 of those photos public, urged the Department of Justice to release investigative files it has related to Epstein ahead of the Dec. 19 deadline to do so to comply with a newly passed law.One image among a batch of photos released Friday morning shows Trump standing in the middle of a row of six women, whose faces were covered over by the Democrats before release. Some of the women are wearing Hawaiian leis around their necks. Trump is shown in another photo standing behind Epstein at what appears to be a social event. A third photo shows Trump sitting next to a woman, whose face is blacked out, on what appears to be a plane.Trump was a longtime friend of Epstein before the two men had a falling out sometime in the early 2000s. He has not been accused of any wrongdoing in connection with Epstein, and has denied knowledge of Epstein's abuse of girls and women while they were friends.\"Well, I haven't seen it, but I mean, everybody knew this man,\" Trump said at the White House on Friday evening when asked about the photos of him and others being released.\"He was all over Palm Beach. He has photos with everybody. I mean, almost there are hundreds and hundreds of people that have photos with him,\" Trump said.\"So that's no big deal. I know nothing about it.\" White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson, in a statement to CNBC, accused House Democrats of \"selectively releasing cherry-picked photos with random redactions to try and create a false narrative.\"Jackson called the Democrats' focus on the president's connection to Epstein a \"hoax,\" and argued that the Trump administration \"has done more for Epstein's victims than Democrats ever have\" by releasing documents and calling for transparency.Photo from the Jeffrey Epstein files released by the Democrats on the House Oversight Committee showing Bill Clinton, Ghislaine Maxwell and Jeffrey Epstein with two unknown people.

The photo has Clinton's signature on it.Other photos show former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers, Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, who was previously known as Prince Andrew of Britain, and Epstein's one-time lawyer Alan Dershowitz.The dates, locations and context of the photos were not revealed as part of the release Friday. CNBC is reaching out to the people identified in the photos, all of whom have denied wrongdoing. This story will be updated with their responses.\"This latest production contains over 95,000 photos, including images of the wealthy and powerful men who spent time with Jeffrey Epstein,\" a statement from Democrats on the Oversight Committee said.Photo from the Jeffrey Epstein files released by the Democrats on the House Oversight Committee shows Donald Trump with an unknown woman.

Committee Democrats are committed to protecting the identities of the survivors.\"Rep. Robert Garcia of California, the ranking Democrat on the committee, in a statement said, \"It is time to end this White House cover-up and bring justice to the survivors of Jeffrey Epstein and his powerful friends.\"\"These disturbing photos raise even more questions about Epstein and his relationships with some of the most powerful men in the world.

    "body": "Hoda Kotb knows what it's like to completely overhaul a career and start fresh in a brand-new industry.The longtime journalist left NBC's \"TODAY\" in January after 26 years with the organization, and launched her own company — a wellness brand called Joy 101 — in May. Becoming a first-time CEO at age 60 felt somewhat impossible to her, which is exactly why she decided to do it, she said on a Dec. 8 episode of \"The Mel Robbins Podcast.\"Whether you're \"20 or 40 or 60 or 80,\" you can determine whether such a drastic career change is right for you by asking yourself one important question, said Kotb, now 61: Is this job giving me what I deserve?In Kotb's case, she was ready for a new challenge, and realized during an on-air 60th birthday celebration that continuing her journalism career probably wouldn't fulfill that need, she said. \"I was almost having an out of body [experience],\" she said. \"I kept thinking ... This is the top of the wave. I could feel it ... This is the best it's ever going to be.\"Other people may come to a similar conclusion through more a frustrating process: Maybe you've worked a job where you didn't receive enough positive feedback, or the company lacked opportunities for you to learn and grow.DON'T MISS: The ultimate guide to teaching your kids about moneyIf you feel like you're hitting a professional roadblock, you should sit down and figure out what it is that you feel like you deserve, said Kotb. That self-audit shouldn't come from a place of envy or \"FOMO\" around what someone else has, she noted. And it won't always prompt a total career reset — maybe you'll seek a raise or promotion at work instead, for example.\"Look at your life, just look at it from 35,000 feet and then decide, do I want to change it?\" she said. \"And I'm here to tell you, I feel like I'm living, breathing proof that you can change it at any time. Things you thought were impossible are not impossible.\"Kotb has previously said that her decision to leave \"TODAY\" was also influenced by a desire to spend more time with her family. This was made difficult by her daily 3:15 a.m. wakeup to get to work on time, she told People in May.Entrepreneurship now presents Kotb with a different kind of challenge, she's said. \"Being an entrepreneur is hard,\" Kotb told Variety in May. \"I didn't realize how many hats you wear as an entrepreneur ... I'm learning how to be a boss.\"To make building a new career from scratch feel less intimidating, you can start small, Kotb recommended: Spend 30 minutes per day doing something that'll help you make progress, from working on your resume to creating a business plan or learning a new skill. After a month, for example, you'll have 900 minutes of groundwork, rather than making a spur-of-the-moment decision to quit your job without a plan.\"Baby steps toward the jump,\" said Kotb. \"Sometimes we think we want it and you're like, 'I'm going to run and jump off the cliff' ... Don't do that. We're not idiots. We need our paychecks. We need our insurance. We need these things, but we can explore possibilities at the same time.\"Disclosure: NBC and CNBC are divisions of NBCUniversal.Want to give your kids the ultimate advantage?

    "body": "Today, Dick Van Dyke is officially 100 years old. Born on Dec. 13, 1925, the \"Mary Poppins\" actor took Hollywood by storm with his singing and dancing, and became an Emmy, Grammy and Tony award-winning legend. Now, Van Dyke has earned a new title: centenarian. Over the course of his life, the performer has shared the practices he follows to stay in the best of health.\"When you reach 100, a lot of things don't work too well,\" Van Dyke told The New York Times last month. But \"sometimes I feel like I'm 15 again.\"In his recent book, \"100 Rules for Living to 100: An Optimist's Guide to a Happy Life,\" published last month, Van Dyke explores his secrets for longevity even further. Here are three research-backed staples in his routine that he credits for his 100 years of life. How Dick Van Dyke stays active at 100, and his tips for a long, healthy life1. He moves his body oftenEven at 100, Van Dyke goes to the gym three times a week, he told the New York Times. When he makes his way to each machine, sometimes he dances as he walks, he said.On his off days from the gym, he practices yoga and stretches. Van Dyke said his doctors are amazed at how he's still able to touch his toes.Similar to Van Dyke, many Japanese centenarians — particularly in the blue zone, Okinawa, Japan — start their mornings with exercise. Typically they do a low-intensity workout that airs on the radio, called radio taiso, which is about three minutes long. The exercise also promotes a sense of community because participants tend to practice it alongside friends, colleagues or family.2. He has an optimistic outlook and doesn't turn down opportunities that excite him\"I've decided people are born with a certain personality and a certain outlook, a certain perspective,\" Van Dyke said in a sit-down interview with Al Roker for the TODAY show this November. \"I tend to look on the good side of things.\"Keeping a sense of playfulness in his life helps him experience a lot more fun, he said in his interview with The New York Times. Just last year, Van Dyke starred in Coldplay's music video for the song \"All My Love.\"In the Directors' Cut version of the video, Van Dyke spoke about how his career aligned with his desire to remain a kid at heart. He said he's \"one of those lucky people who got to do for a living what I would have done anyway.\"Often, the happiest centenarians pursue jobs that are fulfilling to them and don't retire. \"Think how lucky I am,\" he said. \"I got to do what I do — play and act silly.\"3. He values quality time with loved onesTowards the end of the \"All My Love\" music video, Van Dyke welcomes his children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren into frame to dance with him. The scene is a symbol of just how much he treasures spending time with his loved ones.Van Dyke is always looking for ways to get his grandchildren and great-grandchildren to enjoy their time at his house, so they want to come back and visit, he told The New York Times. He wants his backyard to resemble a theme park, and mentioned that he's planning to add a zip line next.\"Just hearing them all out there squealing gives me such joy,\" Van Dyke said.A decades-long study conducted by researchers at Harvard found that the key to happiness and longevity is social fitness, or maintaining healthy, long-lasting interpersonal connections.As far as his plans for his birthday today, Van Dyke's itinerary is very relaxed when squared with the major accomplishment of turning 100. Still, it aligns with spending quality time.\"He doesn't want to do anything,\" his wife Arlene Silver told People last week. \"He wants to be in his room watching Jeopardy! reruns with me.\"Want to give your kids the ultimate advantage?

    "body": "Billionaire philanthropist MacKenzie Scott has unveiled the final tally for her 2025 charitable donations, which totaled $7.17 billion in gifts to roughly 225 organizations, she wrote in a blog post published on Tuesday.\"This dollar total will likely be reported in the news, but any dollar amount is a vanishingly tiny fraction of the personal expressions of care being shared into communities this year,\" Scott wrote.Scott's 2025 giving brings her total donation amount since 2019 to $26.3 billion, based on her past public announcements of her charitable giving. This year's donations went to a wide range of nonprofits including several historically Black colleges and universities, and organizations focused on issues including poverty, social injustice and climate change.Scott's updated philanthropic tally puts her behind only fellow billionaires Warren Buffett and Bill Gates in terms of lifetime giving, according to Forbes. Forbes still estimates a $29.9 billion net worth for Scott, who became one of the world's wealthiest women following her 2019 divorce from Amazon founder Jeff Bezos.DON'T MISS: The ultimate guide to teaching your kids about moneyFollowing her divorce, Scott signed The Giving Pledge, committing to giving away the bulk of her wealth in her lifetime. She tasked a team of advisors with helping her step up her philanthropic giving by identifying \"organizations with strong leadership teams and results\" across a wide range of areas of societal need, she wrote in a 2020 blog post.Specifically, she wanted to pay \"special attention to those operating in communities facing high projected food insecurity, high measures of racial inequity, high local poverty rates and low access to philanthropic capital,\" she wrote.In her Tuesday essay, Scott wrote about putting her giving into perspective, citing data from Giving USA, which reported in June that Americans donated more than $590 billion in charitable giving in 2024. Much of the country's philanthropy — whether monetary or otherwise — happens on a relatively small scale, Scott wrote.\"Over 70% of Americans reported giving both labor and money to people they know, and half reported doing the same for strangers,\" wrote Scott, adding: \"It's easy to focus on the methods of civic participation that make news, and hard to imagine the importance of the things we do each day with our own minds and hearts.\"Scott mentioned multiple examples of generosity she received before she became wealthy, helping inspire her more recent philanthropy. She wrote about a \"local dentist who offered me free dental work when he saw me securing a broken tooth with denture glue in college,\" and her college roommate at Princeton University \"who found me crying, and acted on her urge to loan me a thousand dollars to keep me from having to drop out in my sophomore year.\"That roommate, Jeannie Ringo Tarkenton, went on to found Funding U, a student lender that offers loans to low-income students without requiring a co-signer, Scott noted.Scott highlighted those examples while encouraging civic participation in myriad forms, from financial gifts to random acts of kindness: \"Respect, understanding, insight, empathy, forgiveness, inspiration – all of these are meaningful contributions to others.\"Scott's blog post did not break down how or why she chose any of the hundreds of organizations she supported in 2025. A long-standing aspect of her giving does stand out in contrast to many other billionaire philanthropists: Her donations typically come without any strings, meaning organizations are free to use the money however they see fit.Her goal has been to \"de-emphasize privileged voices\" like her own, \"and cede focus to others,\" she wrote in a 2021 blog post.\"People struggling against inequities deserve center stage in stories about change they are creating,\" Scott wrote in that post. \"This is equally — perhaps especially — true when their work is funded by wealth.\"Want to give your kids the ultimate advantage?

    "body": "From how much energy you have first thing in the morning, to how your mood ebbs and flows throughout the day, the foods you eat have a significant impact on how you feel. It's why doctors and nutritionists alike consider the first meal of the day to be most important. Hunter Stoler, a NYC-based certified nutrition and health coach, has a go-to breakfast that he eats just about every day to feel his best. Known as \"Health with Hunter\" on social media, the 25-year-old also recommends this breakfast to his more than 400,000 followers on Instagram and 300,000+ followers on TikTok. \"I'll say six out of every seven days a week, I have a yogurt bowl just because I know it's balanced,\" Stoler tells CNBC Make It.His yogurt bowl recipe is high in fiber and protein.\"It sets me up for success, it makes me feel good and I'm full for a few hours after that,\" he says.The breakfast allows him to up his fiber intake, which, research shows, many people often lack in their diets. Less than 10% of U.S. adults get the recommended daily intake of fiber, according to a study which was presented at Nutrition 2021 Live Online.Here are the key ingredients in Stoler's daily yogurt bowl. Plus, some of his other healthy breakfast options.Health with Hunter's go-to high-fiber, high-protein breakfastJust about every morning, Stoler mixes together these five ingredients:Non-fat Greek yogurtHalf a serving of protein powderFrozen organic wild blueberriesHealthy cereal or granolaSpices (cinnamon, pumpkin spice or a pinch of salt)\"There's flexibility in that, but the structure of the meal is the same,\" Stoler says. \"That combination of protein from the protein powder and Greek yogurt, fiber from the blueberries, and potentially a little bit from the cereal or granola, is what's going to keep me really full and just satisfied.\"Research shows that the antioxidants found in blueberries can help reduce inflammation, improve your brain health and lead to more positive health outcomes.The opportunities are endless, but remember, it's about the structure with flexibility.Hunter StolerNutrition and health coachOne of Stoler's other go-to morning meals that's high in fiber and protein is overnight oatmeal. He mixes together almond milk or whole milk with a cup of glyphosate-free oats and a scoop of protein powder. He stores it in his fridge until the following day.\"Then the next morning, you have delicious oats that you could top with fruit, a nut butter, which is really great, cinnamon and maybe a little bit of Greek yogurt for more protein,\" Stoler says.If he's craving a warm, healthy breakfast, he toasts high-fiber bread and tops it with savory foods like scrambled eggs and avocado, or yogurt for a sweet option. \"The opportunities are endless, but remember, it's about the structure with flexibility,\" he says.Want to give your kids the ultimate advantage?

This administration is working diligently to ensure that aliens in our country illegally can no longer fly unless it is out of our country to self-deport.\"The Times said that it is not known how many people have been arrested as a result of TSA's information sharing.But the newspaper said it had obtained documents that indicate the program led to the Nov. 20 arrest at Boston's Logan Airport of a college student, Any Lucía López Belloza, who was deported to Honduras two days later. López had been on her way to visit her family in Texas for the Thanksgiving holiday.The Times previously reported that López was brought to the United States from Honduras at age 7, and that her family said neither they nor she knew she was subject to a deportation order.",

Cross | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesPrediction markets swung sharply Friday after President Donald Trump said Kevin Warsh has risen to the top of his list to be the next chair of the Federal Reserve.On Kalshi, Warsh's odds jumped to as high as 40% from about 15% after Trump told the Wall Street Journal that Warsh is a top contender. Meanwhile, the implied probability of National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett becoming the next Fed chair dropped below 60% briefly from 80% not long ago.Asked directly whether Warsh was now his leading choice, Trump responded, \"Yes, I think he is,\" according to the paper. The comments quickly reverberated through prediction markets.Trump did imply that Hassett is still very much in the running as well and the NEC director is still leading the race on Kalshi.\"I think you have Kevin and Kevin. They're both — I think the two Kevins are great,\" Trump said.Hassett had been the clear market favorite for months, but by Friday afternoon his odds dipped as investors priced in Trump's latest signal.Other candidates considered included current Governors Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman along with Rick Rieder, who runs the fixed income operation at money management giant BlackRock. They were the last of a group of 11 candidates considered for the post. Kalshi has essentially eliminated their chances for getting the top job.Trump also on Friday reiterated his long-held view that the Fed chair should consult the president on rate policy. Trump has been at odds with the current chair, Jerome Powell, as he continued to urge for lower interest rates. The Fed has reduced the fed funds rates by three-quarters of a percentage point since September.",

    "description": "After 41 draws without a winner, the Powerball lottery jackpot has climbed to $1 billion — the seventh largest in the lottery's history.Even if you do",
    "body": "After 41 draws without a winner, the Powerball lottery jackpot has climbed to $1 billion — the seventh largest in the lottery's history.Even if you don't match all six numbers, smaller prizes of $1 million and $50,000 are still in play.If you somehow beat the odds and win a large cash prize, what happens next can be just as important as the win itself. That's because decisions you make in the first few days can leave you vulnerable to losing or mismanaging the prize.Here are five common mistakes experts say to avoid, starting the moment the ticket is in your hands.1. Handing an unsigned ticket to the store clerkUntil a lottery ticket is signed, \"the person who physically holds a winning ticket\" can claim the prize, according to the South Carolina Education Lottery, one of the state lotteries that administers Powerball.Participating state lotteries generally direct players to use validation tools — self-check terminals, mobile app scanners or official lottery websites — rather than relying on store staff. That guidance exists in part because store clerks have been caught stealing winning tickets.To prevent fraud, you'll want to sign the ticket in ink right away, state lotteries advise. It also can't hurt to have a photocopy or photo of the signed ticket, since it can help if your ticket is lost or misplaced, according to the South Carolina Education Lottery.2. Not keeping the ticket in a safe placeYou signed the ticket, but where do you put it? Because a winning ticket functions much like cash, you don't want to keep it in your pocket, wallet or lying on a desk in your home, says George Gagliardi, a certified financial planner in Lexington, Massachusetts.\"Holding the winning ticket before claiming it is akin to walking around town with $100 million in your wallet,\" he says.The official ticket needs a secure location. A common recommendation is to lock it in a bank safe deposit box or a personal fireproof safe or lockbox as soon as possible.3. Telling everyone about winningAnnouncing a big lottery win can invite financial requests, scams and unwanted attention, says Gagliardi. It's often safer to keep the news within a very small circle of trusted family members.Some state lotteries require winners to go public when they claim the prize, which is why it can help to consult a financial advisor, a lawyer and an accountant before coming forward, State Farm advises.They can walk you through payout options and, in some states, help set up a trust that allows you to claim the prize anonymously.4. Rushing to claim your prizeWinners are often given between 90 days and a year to claim a prize, depending on the state.Rushing to claim it can prevent you from building the advisory team you'll need to manage immense wealth. Without a lawyer, accountant and financial advisor experienced in large windfalls, you risk making costly decisions about taxes, investments and spending, State Farm reports.5. Deciding on the payout too quicklyPowerball winners must choose between two payout options: a 30-year annuity worth the full listed jackpot amount or a lump-sum cash payout that is roughly half the advertised prize. For a $1 billion jackpot, the annuity would pay about $33.3 million per year, according to USAMega.com.Each option comes with tradeoffs. The annuity provides guaranteed installments with a larger total payout over time, while the cash option gives you immediate access to a sizable sum that can be invested right away. Your age, estate planning needs and comfort with investment risk can all shape which payout structure makes the most sense. Consult a trusted financial professional who can help you make decisions based on your individual financial situation.It can also help to slow down before making a choice, since \"you will be in an emotional state for a while, and one wants to make decisions logically, not emotionally,\" says John Loyd, a certified financial planner in Texas.Want to give your kids the ultimate advantage?

    "body": "Noah Schnapp, Caleb McLaughlin, Finn Wolfhard and Gaten Matarazzo star in Season 5 of Netflix's \"Stranger Things.\"Courtesy: NetflixThe original concept for what would become \"Stranger Things\" was rejected by more than 15 studios before landing a spot on Netflix's roster of original programming. A decade later, the show created, written and directed by Matt and Ross Duffer has become one of the biggest cultural touchstones of the streaming era and has solidified Netflix as not just a competitor, but a leader in the space.\"People always talk about Netflix and [say] our big moment was when we'd put on 'House of Cards,' and that was a big deal. But our real moment was when we put on 'Stranger Things,'\" co-CEO Ted Sarandos said during the \"Stranger Things\" Season 5 premiere in Los Angeles last month.\"'House of Cards' was great. It kind of told the world that we're going to make some really good TV shows,\" he continued. \"But with 'Stranger Things,' this was a lot closer to a 'Star Wars' moment. This is a show, characters that move the culture, that spawned live events and consumer products and spinoffs and sequels.\"The final bowReleased in 2016, \"Stranger Things\" is set in the '80s and centers on a group of middle schoolers in a fictional rural town in Indiana who must navigate paranormal and supernatural occurrences following the disappearance of their friend. In the mix is a young girl with psychokinetic powers who has escaped from a secret research lab, an alcoholic police chief who is trying to find the missing boy and a frantic mother.Now, almost a decade later, the fifth and final season is making its staggered debut on Netflix.An advertisement for \"Stranger Things\" on one of Netflix's buildings in the Hollywood neighborhood of Los Angeles, Dec. 2, 2025.Mike Blake | ReutersVolume 1, which consists of the first four episodes, debuted over the Thanksgiving holiday and amassed 59.6 million views in the first five days, the biggest premiere week for an English-language series on Netflix. It ranks third overall behind Season 2 and Season 3 of the Korean series \"Squid Game.\"In its second week on the platform, Volume 1 generated another 23.6 million views, topping the streamer's weekly charts, and each of the previous four seasons saw week-over-week viewership bumps, as fans rewatched prior episodes, Netflix reported.Volume 2 of \"Stranger Things\" Season 5, which contains three episodes, arrives on Christmas, and the finale episode, which has a run time of a little over two hours, is set for New Year's Eve. The finale will be available for viewing in select theaters New Year's Eve and New Year's Day. In a break with tradition, Netflix will not be selling tickets for these screenings. Instead, more than 500 domestic cinemas will sell concession vouchers that will guarantee seating for the showings. These vouchers can be used toward purchases of food and beverages at the venues. Furthermore, theater owners will keep all revenue from these purchases.Netflix and exhibitors have tangled in the past over release terms, as the streamer does not commit to a prolonged run in theaters for movies that it wants to be eligible for awards contention. \"Nothing would make us happier than to play Netflix theatrical movies in our theaters,\" AMC's CEO Adam Aron said in a statement earlier this month. \"We think that could be beneficial for all involved. But as we need to treat our existing studio partners fairly, there is much that still needs to be sorted out to that end. Even so, there is progress.\"Turning culture upside down\"Stranger Things\" has brought about a renaissance of the 1980s, reviving fashion trends, music and even discontinued food brands for a new generation.When the series debuted, Netflix partnered with consumer brands to create T-shirts, mugs, plush toys and the like, but it was predominantly working with licensees. This means it was collecting fees for other companies to design and make the products, or participating in brand partnerships where no fees were exchanged.In 2019, the company launched its own consumer products division and two years later its own officially licensed online shop.Coinciding with the launch of the final season of \"Stranger Things,\" Netflix announced dozens of partnerships and collaborations with brands across the merchandise, retail and restaurant spectrum. The streamer has tapped Lego, Funko, Squishmallows, Hasbro, Jazwares and Care Bears to bring \"Stranger Things\" toys and collectibles to fans of the series. It has apparel and lifestyle deals with Gap, Nike, Crocs, CoverGirl, Zara and Wrangler, among others, and food and beverage collaborations with the likes of Eggo, Doritos, Kellogg, Gatorade and Starbucks.Millie Bobby Brown as Eleven in the first season of Netflix's \"Stranger Things.\"Courtesy: Netflix\"We are incredibly excited to partner with so many fantastic brands, offering fans — and fellow nerds — the largest collection of products and experiences in 'Stranger Things' history and one of our biggest campaigns yet as we celebrate the fifth and final season of this globally beloved series,\" said Marian Lee, Netflix's chief marketing officer, in a statement earlier this month.Outside the retail space, Netflix has delved into the live event space, bringing \"Stranger Things\" to life through an immersive experience that enables fans to explore Hawkins Lab and other iconic locations from the series. It's currently running in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, and will open in Mexico City next month. There is also a play called \"Stranger Things: The First Shadow,\" which has been running in the West End in London since 2023 and in New York since this spring.In addition, Netflix has a deal with Epic Games that has brought \"Stranger Things\" items to the popular online video game Fortnite. Netflix's merchandise and live events strategy is more than a way for the company to generate revenue outside of its streaming subscriptions. It helps keep fans engaged with its content during show hiatuses and in between movie sequels, industry experts said.The cast of Netflix's \"Stranger Things\" Season 5.Courtesy: NetflixThis playbook is not unique to Netflix, but it showcases the maturation of the streaming service. \"Strangers Things\" is less of a blueprint that can be adopted by every Netflix show or film, but rather a gold standard for what is possible.\"[Netflix] had a few good shows early on ('Orange is the New Black' and 'House of Cards'), but it took a couple of years of whiffs before they came up with 'Stranger Things,'\" Michael Pachter, analyst at Wedbush, told CNBC via email. \"They have had a ton of success since, with shows like 'Squid Game' and 'Bridgerton,' but it was questionable if they could settle on a formula for coming up with original IP.\"'Stranger Things' has remained a solid IP throughout, and has driven a lot of recognition,\" he added.",

    "body": "A tract of new tightly packed homes are viewed along the Boulder City Parkway on January 11, 2022 in Henderson, Nevada.George Rose | Getty ImagesHome values have been losing ground for much of this year, with previously huge annual gains shrinking to nothing. The result is that homeowners are losing equity.Borrower equity fell 2.1% in the third quarter of this year compared with the same period a year ago, or a collective $373.8 billion, according to a report from Cotality. This comes after years of steep gains in home prices and record equity. Even after the drop, homeowners still have an overall collective net equity of $17.1 trillion for homes with a mortgage. For the average homeowner, the third-quarter equity declines translate to a loss of $13,400. In addition, the number of homes in a negative equity position, meaning they are worth less than the mortgage on them, increased by 21% from a year ago to 1.2 million. \"As the pace of home price growth slows and markets recalibrate from pandemic peaks, we're seeing a clear shift in equity trends,\" said Selma Hepp, chief economist at Cotality. \"Negative equity is on the rise, driven in part by affordability challenges that have led many first-time and lower-income buyers to over-leverage through piggyback loans or minimal down payments.\"Get Property Play directly to your inboxCNBC's Property Play with Diana Olick covers new and evolving opportunities for the real estate investor, delivered weekly to your inbox.Subscribe here to get access today.Those in a negative equity position likely purchased their homes more recently, when mortgage rates were higher and prices had peaked. Homeowners have also been pulling more equity out of their homes, thanks to huge gains in the past five years. Home values are now roughly 52% higher than they were in January 2020, according to the S&P Cotality Case-Shiller national home price index. Even after mortgage rates increased in 2023, the average equity gain per homeowner was $25,000. In 2024, it was $4,900. Not every market, however, is seeing the same dynamic. Boston, Chicago and New York are all still in the positive, according to the Cotality report. The biggest losses were in Los Angeles, San Francisco, Washington, Miami and Houston, Texas.\"The future performance of highly leveraged loans will hinge on the strength of the U.S. economy and labor market,\" Hepp said. \"Even as expectations for continued price appreciation and economic resilience persist, it remains critical to closely monitor these loans in the months ahead.\"",

He said he still believes in the power of artificial intelligence and suggested some of these names might be worth buying once their valuations come down.\"We need every piece of data to keep up on what's really happening as the money rotates from the Magnificent Seven to all these other different other areas, kind of like a fire hose,\" he said.Tuesday brings the Labor Department's nonfarm payroll report. Cramer noted that Wall Street has largely been in the dark about macroeconomic data for the past few months thanks to the lengthy government shutdown. A strong jobs report could call into question the need for more rate cuts from the Federal Reserve, Cramer said, while weaker figures mean the central bank can keep easing. Retail sales data is also set to be released on Tuesday, and Cramer added that this report needs to be weak to justify more cuts.Jabil and General Mills are set to report Wednesday. Cramer noted that Jabil is a major manufacturer of infrastructure and hardware for data centers. He said the company's earnings could reverse the declines in AI stocks. Cramer indicated he'll be waiting to hear from industry giant General Mills, noting that a number of food stocks have struggled recently due to the popularity of GLP-1 weight loss drugs and a growing emphasis on healthier eating habits.On Thursday, Darden, Cintas, Nike and FedEx will report. While the rising price of beef has hurt some restaurants, Cramer suggested restaurant giant Darden has been protected by its Olive Garden chain, which he said has \"minimal beef exposure.\" He said uniform and safety equipment supplier Cintas will be a solid measure of how small businesses are faring. It may be too soon to expect a turnaround at Nike, Cramer continued, but FedEx could be the \"star of the week.\" He praised the shipping company's management, adding that the e-commerce boom seems set to to continue. Friday brings earnings from Carnival, Conagra and Paychex, and Cramer suggested all three reports will provide valuable insight. Carnival can speak to the state of discretionary spending, Conagra can show whether consumers are cooking more meals at home, and payroll processer Paychex can give a read on small and medium-sized businesses.watch nowSign up now for the CNBC Investing Club to follow Jim Cramer's every move in the market.Disclaimer The CNBC Investing Club holds shares of Nike.Questions for Cramer?

    "description": "Between long office days, late dinners and endless to-dos, many working couples slip into a routine of coexisting instead of really connecting. The ex",
    "body": "Between long office days, late dinners and endless to-dos, many working couples slip into a routine of coexisting instead of really connecting. The excuses feel valid: \"We're exhausted,\" or, \"We'll catch up this weekend.\" The problem is that they both end up missing the everyday moments that keep a relationship alive.As a psychologist who studies couples and as a husband, I've found that people in the happiest, most resilient relationships treat their weeknights as opportunities that don't go wasted.Here are the seven things these couples consistently do before bedtime.1. They start with decompression timeYou can't always expect your partner to walk through the door ready to cook, talk, or be cheerful. Healthy couples build in 15 to 30 minutes of guilt-free alone time for each partner — one decompresses while the other handles a light task, then they switch.It's not glamorous, but it's a huge kindness. By protecting each other's battery early in the evening, they preserve the bandwidth they'll need to connect later on.2. They 'silent sync' when they're drainedSome nights, even after a decompression session, you may still feel drained. Happy couples don't force it. They start their evening together, but quietly: sitting on the balcony, lying side by side, taking a slow walk.In psychological research, this is a form of co-regulation: the process of two people syncing up emotionally, allowing the emotions of the day to rise and fall until they feel like themselves again. A few minutes of shared quiet can reset your rhythm better than a forced conversation.3. They do a quick daily recapNot every weeknight has room for deep emotional check-ins. So the happiest couples keep it simple: each person shares one thing about their day, good or bad. It could be venting some frustration, sharing a little win they had at the office or even just something funny that happened. No advice. No solutions. Just listening. This light, consistent sharing keeps them emotionally updated without draining what's left of their workweek energy.4. They keep one honored ritual, no matter whatEven on nights when both partners want to zone out, they stick to one small shared ritual they never skip. For most, it's something ridiculously simple: eating dinner together without their phones, making a nightly cup of tea, or doing a word game together. The ritual becomes a daily anchor — something predictable, comforting, and theirs alone.5. They cuddle before sleepIf I had to choose just one nightly habit to keep, this would be it. Research shows that partners who cuddle regularly report higher relationship satisfaction and commitment, even compared with couples who emphasize \"quality time\" together.Cuddling triggers oxytocin (the bonding hormone) and lowers cortisol (the stress hormone). It's the easiest, fastest biological boost your relationship can get.6. They 'close the kitchen' as a teamEven the happiest couples feel the low-level resentment of uneven household work. That's why they end the evening with 5 to 10 minutes of shared tidying, wiping counters, packing tomorrow's lunches, loading the dishwasher.The point isn't actually about cleaning, but rather to prove that they're committed to keeping things fair.7. They check in about tomorrowInstead of rehashing the day, heathy and happy couples look ahead. They share one small thing they're looking forward to tomorrow, or even one small thing they're dreading.This is a brief, gentle way for working couples to stay in sync without needing to fully rehash the emotional weight of their day. You get a sense of what your partner might need tomorrow, whether it's encouragement, space, or just a little extra support. And they get the same from you.Mark Travers, PhD, is a psychologist who specializes in relationships. He holds degrees from Cornell University and the University of Colorado Boulder.

    "body": "John Furner, Walmart U.S. CEO, speaks to CNBC’s Sara Eisen during the Invest in America Forum on Oct. 15, 2025.Aaron Clamage | CNBCManufacturing is seeing renewed attention from corporate America, with Walmart among the major companies publicly reaffirming its commitment to domestic production. At CNBC's inaugural Invest in America Forum, Walmart U.S. CEO John Furner said the company is increasing its investments in U.S.-made products and suppliers, describing it as part of a long-standing, strategic priority. \"Investing in U.S. manufacturing and U.S. operations, sure, it's great for business, but it's also great for employment. It's great for jobs. It's great for the country, and it helps us with our supply chain being flexible and dynamic,\" Furner said. Nearly two-thirds of the products Walmart sells are made, grown or assembled in the United States, according to Furner. Walmart is expanding on that front, including a new beef processing facility in Olathe, Kansas, which he said is expected to create over 600 jobs. \"It's a big investment, and having quality products that are sourced in a more sustainable way that can deliver to customers is really important,\" Furner said. Furner also pointed to specific categories where domestic production is being revived, citing a recent partnership with USAntibiotics aimed at \"bringing back products like amoxicillin so that they're made here in the United States.\"Still, global sourcing remains essential for Walmart's operations. \"We source from all around the world,\" Furner said. \"There are things that are grown around the world that tend to do better in other climates, you know, coffee might be an example … I think there are a lot of possibilities.\"The heightened public focus on U.S. manufacturing comes amid trade policy uncertainty, with tariffs and interest rates remaining central to retailers' equation of how much inventory to stock and what to set prices at. For his part, Furner was uncertain about the future for the levies. \"As policies change, they'll change. Environments will change. That happens. Commodities change,\" he said. \"We've landed in a place where we have more rollbacks going into the fall than we had at the beginning of the year, and that's something we're proud of.\"Despite uncertain economic headwinds, Furner said Walmart is pushing to lower prices for consumers. \"We want to try to keep prices as low as we can, as long as we can,\" he said. \"We see a resilient customer that makes really smart choices for what's right for them and their families at the time of shopping.\"",

The Supreme Court is scheduled to hear arguments on Nov. 5 on Trump's request that it overturn lower-court rulings, which found that a president does not have authority under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to impose the country-specific tariffs he implemented earlier this year.The White House did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment on Trump's statement.",

Hussein Faleh | AFP | Getty ImagesU.S. President Donald Trump said Wednesday that Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi told him New Delhi will stop buying oil from Russia, though the move will take time.\"[Modi] assured me today that they will not be buying oil from Russia. That's a big stop.\" Trump said at the press briefing in the Oval Office. \"Now we've got to get China to do the same thing.\"He added that Washington was unhappy with New Delhi's purchases of Russian crude because it allowed Moscow to continue waging its \"ridiculous war\" in Ukraine.However, the U.S. president also said that the halt will not be immediate, and there will be \"a little bit of a process,\" without giving a clear timeline.India's external affairs ministry said Friday that the country's oil import decisions are driven by efforts to protect consumers by ensuring stable energy prices and securing supplies.The ministry's priority was to \"safeguard the interests of the Indian consumer in a volatile energy scenario,\" External Affairs Ministry spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said in a statement.He added that India's import policies are guided \"entirely\" by that goal.Jaiswal said that India has sought for years to expand energy trade with the U.S. \"This has steadily progressed in the last decade,\" he said, adding that \"the current Administration has shown interest in deepening energy cooperation with India. Discussions are ongoing.\"India and Russian crudeIndia's imports of Russian oil have been a sticking point in the relationship between Washington and New Delhi. Trump slapped additional tariffs of 25% on India back in August, raising the total levy to 50%, while India has called out the U.S. for its trade with Russia.\"If India doesn't buy [Russian] oil, it makes [ending the war] much easier,\" Trump said. \"They assured me within a short period of time, they will not be buying oil from Russia, and they will go back to Russia after the war is over.\"On Thursday, Brent crude futures climbed 0.82% to $62.43 a barrel by 10:31 p.m. ET, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate futures climbed 0.89% to $58.79.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconIndia is one of the biggest buyers of Russian oil. Data from research firm Kpler shows Russia exports about 3.35 million barrels of crude per day, with India taking about 1.7 million and China 1.1 million.New Delhi has defended those purchases, with Energy Minister Hardeep Singh Puri telling CNBC in July that New Delhi helped stabilize global energy prices and was encouraged by the U.S. to do so.\"If people or countries had stopped buying at that stage, the price of oil would have gone up to 130 dollars a barrel. That was a situation in which we were advised, including by our friends in the United States, to please buy Russian oil, but within the price cap,\" Puri said.Russian sales of crude oil have been placed under a price cap by the G7 nations and the European Union since Moscow's 2022 invasion of Ukraine.That price cap, set at $47.6 per barrel, aims to limit Moscow's revenue from oil exports, constricting the country's ability to finance its war in Ukraine.Stock Chart IconStock chart icon",

The airline increased capacity 7% in the third quarter over last year. Unit passenger revenue for the three months ended Sept. 30 fell 3.3% for domestic travel and 7.1% for international. Sales from its lucrative loyalty program rose 9%.In an interview last month, United CEO Scott Kirby last month defended the airline's growth plan and said the carrier was winning loyal customers through its network, new technology like complimentary inflight Wi-Fi, refreshed cabins and new lounges.\"Those investments over almost a decade, combined with great service from our people, have allowed United to win and retain brand-loyal customers, leading to economic resilience even with macro economic volatility through the first three quarters of the year and significant upside as the economy and demand are improving in the fourth quarter,\" Kirby said in a release on Wednesday.Still, for the third quarter, United beat earnings expectations, although its revenue fell short of estimates.Here is what United Airlines reported for the quarter that ended Sept. 30 compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on estimates compiled by LSEG:Earnings per share: $2.78 adjusted vs. $2.62 expectedRevenue: $15.23 billion vs. $15.33 billion expectedUnited's third-quarter revenue was $15.23 billion, up 2.6% from $14.84 billion last year. Net income fell 1.7% to $949 million or $2.90 a share. Adjusting for one-time items including debt, among other things, United posted income of $909 million or $2.78 a share.The carrier is vying with Delta Air Lines to win over more affluent travelers who shell out more for seats, and it has expanded its global network with far-flung destinations like Greenland and Mongolia. United said in the third quarter, its premium-cabin revenue, which includes first class and other, roomier seats, rose 6%. United's sales from no-frills basic economy 4% year-over-year.In the spring and early summer, United and other carriers trimmed their earnings forecasts they made at the start of the year, after passenger demand dipped amid on-again-off-again tariffs, and an oversupply of flights weighed on airfare.",

    "body": "Albert Bourla, CEO of Pfizer, Charlie Scharf, Wells Fargo & Company CEO and Kathy Warden, Northrop Grumman Chair & CEO speak during the Invest in America Forum on Oct. 15, 2025.Aaron Clamage | CNBCWells Fargo CEO Charlie Scharf and Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla sounded the alarm Wednesday over the potential for the the U.S. to lose its competitive edge to China, but said artificial intelligence could help America maintain its lead.Speaking at CNBC's inaugural Invest in America Forum in Washington, D.C., the two executives said that while the U.S. still leads in many sectors, inconsistent policy and underinvestment is ceding ground to China. AI, they said, poses both risks and benefits for the U.S. economy.Scharf said AI will likely reduce the size of workforces — but will boost productivity.\"We will likely have less people, absolutely,\" Scharf said. \"When we look at the tools that we've implemented just for people that are coding, you see 20%, 30%, 40% improvement in coders. We haven't reduced our head count by 20%, 30% or 40%. We're actually doing more than we otherwise would have been able to do.\"Wells Fargo big bank peers like JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs are already hiring fewer people because of AI advancements.Scharf also said the financial sector is poised for major regulatory changes despite an ongoing political stalemate in Washington.\"We ultimately do expect significant changes in capital requirements, liquidity requirements,\" he said. \"We do expect to see changes which will allow people in the industry, not just big banks and medium-sized banks, but smaller banks as well, to do more in these [local] communities.\"Bourla, meanwhile, expressed concern about China's growing strength in biotechnology and pharmaceuticals, pointing to a surge in research and development spending, regulatory reforms and a national strategy focused on life sciences.\"They [China] filed more patents this year than the U.S.,\" Bourla said. \"That's never happened in history. Five years ago, the split was 90%-10%. ... The gap is closing, but they probably will become [better than us] unless we get our act together.\"Bourla urged the U.S. to shift focus from trying to slow China's progress toward improving its own productivity and innovation.\"We spend more time trying to think about how to slow down China rather than think how we can become better than them,\" Bourla said. \"We need to have regulatory changes here. We need to have stability. Tariffs and pricing was not helping.\"Pfizer recently agreed to a drug pricing deal with the Trump administration as part of a broader effort to remove long-standing uncertainties around pricing, Medicaid reimbursements and distribution. As part of the agreement, Pfizer secured a three-year exemption from pharmaceutical-specific tariffs, contingent on additional investments in U.S. manufacturing. \"Tariffs and the uncertainty of drastic correction of U.S. pricing — with this deal, we are removing both uncertainties,\" Bourla said Wednesday.He also called artificial intelligence the next frontier for medicine, predicting that AI will revolutionize drug discovery by dramatically accelerating timelines for finding treatments for diseases like Alzheimer's and cancer.\"We tried for years to find cures ... AI will make it happen,\" Bourla said.",

David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesPresident Donald Trump's tariffs are pushing inflation generally higher as companies are caught between absorbing the costs or passing them onto customers, according to a Federal Reserve report Wednesday.The central bank's periodic Beige Book report, published eight times a year generally at about six-week intervals, categorized overall economic growth as having \"changed little\" since the last report on Sept. 3. Labor markets \"were largely stable\" as demand was \"muted\" for most of the Fed's 12 districts.When it came to prices, though, Trump's duties implemented in April and then staggered through ensuing months showed an impact.\"Prices rose further during the reporting period,\" the report stated. \"Tariff-induced input cost increases were reported across many Districts, but the extent of those higher costs passing through to final prices varied.\"In some cases, firms held prices unchanged to stay competitive and to appease inflation-sensitive clients. However, some businesses said they were \"fully passing higher import costs along to their customers.\"A few districts reported that slowing demand actually pushed prices down for materials.The trade war has escalated in recent days as China has ordered restrictions on coveted rare earths materials, while Trump has retaliated with a threat of 100% tariffs on Chinese imports.The release comes amid a dearth of relevant economic data due to a government shutdown entering its third week. Key providers such as the Labor and Commerce departments are largely closed due to the impasse.However, Bureau of Labor Statistics workers have been called back to release the pivotal consumer price index report used both as an inflation gauge and to index cost of living adjustments for Social Security recipients. The CPI reading, which normally would have been released Wednesday, will come out Oct. 24, the last inflation reading the Fed will get before its policy meeting Oct. 28-29.The Beige Book said consumer spending nudged lower in recent weeks, though it noted \"strong\" spending on luxury items and travel by upper-income earners. Lower and medium earners, meanwhile, pursued discounts and promotions.Future expectations improved in some districts, though Philadelphia reported caution over a prolonged government shutdown.",

    "body": "The TSMC logo is displayed on a building in Hsinchu, Taiwan April 15, 2025. Ann Wang | ReutersTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company on Thursday reported a 39.1% increase in third-quarter profit from last year, beating estimates and hitting a fresh record as demand for artificial intelligence chips stayed strong.Here are the company's results versus LSEG SmartEstimates:Revenue: NT$989.92 billion new Taiwan dollars, vs. NT$977.46 billion expectedNet income: NT$452.3 billion, vs. NT$417.69 billion TSMC's revenue in the September quarter rose 30.3% from a year ago to NT$989.92 billion, also beating estimates. Net income increased 13.7% from last quarter, which had marked a record high at the time. As Asia's largest technology company by market capitalization, TSMC has benefited from the artificial-intelligence boom, producing advanced AI processors for clients such as Nvidia and Apple.\"Recent developments in AI market continue to be very positive,\" TSMC CEO C.C. Wei said in an earnings call, adding that increasing adoption of AI models by consumers has led to more demand for compute, and by extension, semiconductor products. \"Thus, our conviction in the AI mega trend is strengthening,\" he added. Bolstered by this AI strength, Wei said that the company had raised its 2025 revenue growth forecast to the mid-30% range. In July, the company had expected full-year revenue growth of about 30%.TSMC also increased its expected floor for capacity expansion and upgrades to $40 billion for the full year, up from a previous floor of $38 billion.Cutting-edge chips TSMC's high-performance computing division, which encompasses artificial intelligence and 5G applications, made up the majority of sales in the July-September quarter, accounting for 57% of revenues.TSMC said advanced chips, with sizes 7-nanometer or smaller, accounted for 74% of TSMC's total wafer revenue in the quarter. In semiconductor technology, smaller nanometer sizes signify more compact transistor designs, which lead to greater processing power and efficiency. watch nowGrowth in TSMC's most advanced chips particularly drove revenue gains in the third quarter, according to Counterpoint Research senior analyst William Li.\"TSMC's robust earnings are a direct reflection of the strong traction at 3nm as well as high utilization at 4/5nm – both of which are being driven by ongoing orders from AI GPU and HPC customers and premium smartphone platforms,\" Li told CNBC in a statement. TSMC executives also said Thursday that they were monitoring U.S. tariff developments as Taiwan negotiates for a lower \"reciprocal\" rate and Washington weighs industry-specific duties on semiconductors. However, TSMC is likely to receive some exemptions. \"We understand there are uncertainties and risks from the potential impact of tariff policies, especially in consumer-related and price-sensitive market segments,\" Wei said, adding that the company would continue to monitor and plan for any impact. TSMC has been investing heavily in facilities in the U.S. — spending that could help reduce its exposure to tariff impacts.Shares of TSMC in Taiwan have risen more than 38% so far this year.",

Michael Short | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesSalesforce shares rose as much as 5% in extended trading on Wednesday after the software vendor issued new financial targets for the next few years.The company said it now expects revenue of over $60 billion in 2030, above the $58.37 billion consensus among analysts polled by LSEG.The guidance excludes impact from the pending acquisition of data management company Informatica. The $8 billion deal, announced in May, is slated to close in the fiscal fourth quarter or in the first quarter of the 2027 fiscal year.\"We have had some lower-stage growth for a while,\" Robin Washington, Salesforce's chief operating and financial officer, said during an investor briefing at the company's annual Dreamforce conference in San Francisco. \"That is reaccelerating.\"She company called for an organic year-over-year revenue growth rate above 10% in the 2026 through 2030 fiscal years. The growth rate has been under 10% since mid-2024.Investors have been concerned, in part because of the rise of \"vibe-coding\" tools for automatically generating software with a few words of human input. Industry observers have predicted that artificial intelligence services might threaten longstanding software providers. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said in April that AI is creating up to 30% of new code at the company.\"There's a certain amount of, let's just say, nonsense that's out there,\" Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff said on Wednesday. \"Like, for example, that these products are writing all the software, and that is not what's happening.\"As of Wednesday's close, Salesforce's stock had fallen 29% for the year, while the Nasdaq has gained 17%.To increase revenue, Salesforce is counting on its Agentforce software for automating customer service and other business processes, said Washington, who also sits on Salesforce's board. The company introduced Agentforce last year as a way for brands to add chat-based customer service agents that connect large language models to internal data.\"Investors continue to ask why Agentforce adoption has been slower than anticipated,\" analysts at RBC Capital Markets wrote in a note to clients earlier this month.Salesforce executives are hoping product enhancements will attract more business.The company on Monday released Agentforce Voice, which allows clients to have agents answer customer service calls. On Tuesday, Salesforce announced larger partnerships with AI model developers Anthropic and OpenAI, bringing their latest models to Agentforce.At Dreamforce, Salesforce pointed to Agentforce adoption at FedEx, Pandora, PepsiCo, Williams Sonoma and other companies.WATCH: People don't understand Agentforce is part and parcel of Salesforce, says CEO Marc Benioffwatch now",

    "body": "Jars of Nescafe Instant coffee, part of food giant Nestle's portfolio, sit on a supermarket shelf in Encinitas, California, U.S., September 2, 2025.     Mike Blake | ReutersNestle said Thursday it will cut 16,000 jobs as the firm's new CEO Philipp Navratil looks to accelerate a turnaround at the consumer goods giant.In a bid to improve operational efficiency, the firm said it will cut 12,000 white-collar jobs and a further 4,000 roles will be reduced over the next two years.Shares were last trading 7.2 higher on Thursday.Under its former CEO Laurent Freixe, Nestle had already announced a cost-savings programme worth 2.5 billion Swiss francs ($3.14 billion). This has now been accelerated to 3 billion Swiss francs by the end of 2027. The company posted a better-than-expected organic growth rate of 4.3% in the third quarter as it battles an uncertain consumer outlook amid U.S. tariffs and an increase in raw material prices, such as cocoa and coffee beans. Notably, Real Internal Growth (RIG) returned to positive territory in the third quarter — up 1.5% — as the maker of Nespresso and KitKat saw growth investments pay off, also helped by easier comparisons. watch nowA miss on RIG in the second quarter had led to a sharp underformance of Nestle shares. Ahead of the results, analysts at HSBC had already expected RIG to return to positive territory \"owing to easier comparatives, incrementally greater benefits from Nestle's own actions plus reduced elasticity effects from price increases.\"However, the company's business in Greater China continued to underperform, with the region negatively impacting organic growth by 80 basis points and RIG by 40 basis points. Nestle added that \"new management was now in place and it was executing its plan to transform the business.\" The firm's strategy of focusing on winners and turnarounding its losers helped driver better-than-expected third quarter sales, said Jon Cox, head of European consumer equities, at Kepler Chevreux.\"Overall, it is extremely positive and certainly looks operationally as if the company has turned the corner with the better performance while the management upheaval over the summer fades into the background,\" Cox said, adding that he expects the stock to react very positively.Turbulent yearThe Vevey, Switzerland-based consumer goods giant has come under pressure from investors as its operating and share performance have trailed peers.Its shares are off more than 40% from its Dec 2021 peak, and have fallen 9% over the past 12 months. Stock Chart IconStock chart iconNestle's sharesNestle has endured a turbulent year, as it saw its CEO Laurent Freixe ousted over an undisclosed romantic relationship on September 1. His successor, Navratil is the former CEO of the company's Nespresso business. He has pledged to \"fully embrace the company's strategic direction, as well as the action plan in place to drive Nestle's performance,\" and vowed to \"accelerate execution and to drive the value creation plan with intensity.\" Only two weeks later, Nestle saw itself forced to accelerate Chairman Paul Bulcke's departure, owing to pressure from institutional shareholders over his handling of Freixe's allegations. Bulcke, also a former CEO of Nestle, stepped down from his role earlier than planned, handing over the reins to Vice Chairman and Chairman elect Pablo Isla, a former Inditex CEO, who was set to take over after Nestle's AGM in April 2026. Analysts say the new leadership duo will need to earn back trust from investors. \"Many long term investors … would have to hear more from someone who is relatively unknown to the market before becoming more positive,\" Deutsche Bank analysts wrote in a September note.While the initial focus will be on recovery in volume growth and its Chinese business, longer-term investors will be keen to receive updates on the partial sale of Nestle's struggling water unit as well as its underperforming vitamins business, along with plans for its 20% stake in L'Oreal. \"Now we must do more and move faster to accelerate our growth momentum,\" Navratil said Thursday in a statement on the company's earnings. \"As Nestle moves forward, we will be rigorous in our approach to resource allocation, prioritising the opportunities and businesses with the highest potential return.\"",

The index finished at 20.6 on Wednesday stateside.Australia's ASX/S&P 200 rose to a new record after the country's seasonally adjusted unemployment rate jumped to a near four-year high in September at 4.5%. That compares with the 4.3% estimated by Reuters-polled economists and the 4.2% rate in August.Meanwhile, employment rose by 14,900 in September, missing expectations for a 20,000 rise.

The order blocks the Trump administration from taking any action to follow through with those workers' termination, or to issue RIFs to other federal employees protected by two unions that filed a lawsuit to prevent the firings.\"The activities that are being undertaken here are contrary to the laws,\" San Francisco U.S. District Court Judge Susan Yvonne Illston told lawyers for the administration on Wednesday at a hearing where she issued the TRO.\"You can't do this in a nation of laws,\" Illston said, according to NBC News. \"And we have laws here, and the things that are being articulated here are not within the law.\"The judge cited comments by President Donald Trump and White House Budget Director Russell Vought that have indicated the workers were being laid off explicitly to target programs favored by Democrats.In a written order issued later Wednesday, Illston called the firings during a shutdown \"unprecedented.\"\"It is also far from normal for an administration to fire line-level civilian employees during agovernment shutdown as a way to punish the opposing political party,\" Illston wrote.\"But this is precisely what President Trump has announced he is doing, by taking to social media on the second day of the shutdown to post: 'I have a meeting today with Russ Vought, he of PROJECT 2025 Fame, to determine which of the many Democrat Agencies, most of which are a political SCAM, he recommends to be cut, and whether or not those cuts will be temporary or permanent. I can't believe the Radical Left Democrats gave me this unprecedented opportunity.'\"Two unions representing tens of thousands of federal workers had asked Illston to block the RIFs, and the order Illston issued applies to any employee represented by those unions. She scheduled a hearing for Oct. 28 on the unions' request for a preliminary injunction that would continue to block the Trump administration from restarting the RIFs. The unions are the American Federation of Government Employees, and the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees.The Trump administration had warned that it would lay off workers during the shutdown, and Trump has repeatedly said that the cuts were aimed at \"Democrat agencies\" or initiatives.Shortly before Illston issued her order blocking layoffs, Vought, during an interview on \"The Charlie Kirk Show,\" said that he expected that \"north of 10,000\" federal jobs would be cut because of their shutdown.Read more CNBC government shutdown coverageJudge blocks Trump from firing federal workers during government shutdown for nowKristi Noem's shutdown airport video may violate Hatch Act, Sen.

    "body": "Jamie Dimon, chief executive officer of JPMorgan Chase & Co., at the Institute of International Finance (IIF) during the annual meetings of the IMF and World Bank in Washington, DC, US, on Thursday, Oct. 24, 2024. Kent Nishimura | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesThe era of artificial intelligence on Wall Street, and its impact on workers, has begun.Big banks including JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs are unveiling plans to reimagine their businesses around AI, technology that allows for the mass production of knowledge work.That means that even during a blockbuster year for Wall Street as trading and investment banking spins off billions of dollars in excess revenue — not typically a time the industry would be keeping a tight lid on head count — the companies are hiring fewer people.JPMorgan said Tuesday in its third-quarter earnings report that while profit jumped 12% from a year earlier to $14.4 billion, head count rose by just 1%.The bank's managers have been told to avoid hiring people as JPMorgan deploys AI across its businesses, CFO Jeremy Barnum told analysts.JPMorgan is the world's biggest bank by market cap and a juggernaut across Main Street and Wall Street finance. Last month, CNBC was first to report about JPMorgan's plans to inject AI into every client and employee experience and every behind-the-scenes process at the bank.The bank has \"a very strong bias against having the reflexive response to any given need to be to hire more people,\" Barnum said Tuesday. JPMorgan had 318,153 employees as of September.JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon told Bloomberg this month that AI will eliminate some jobs, but that the company will retrain those impacted and that its overall head count could grow.'Constrain headcount'At rival investment bank Goldman Sachs, CEO David Solomon on Tuesday issued his own vision statement around how the company would reorganize itself around AI. Goldman is coming off a quarter where profit surged 37% to $4.1 billion.\"To fully benefit from the promise of AI, we need greater speed and agility in all facets of our operations,\" Solomon told employees in a memo this week.\"This doesn't just mean re-tooling our platforms,\" he said. \"It means taking a front-to-back view of how we organize our people, make decisions, and think about productivity and efficiency.\"The upshot for his workers: Goldman would \"constrain headcount growth\" and lay off a limited number of employees this year, Solomon said.Goldman's AI project will take years to implement and will be measured against goals including improving client experiences, higher profitability and productivity, and enriching employee experiences, according to the memo.Even with these plans, which is first looking at reengineering processes like client onboarding and sales, Goldman's overall head count is rising this year, according to bank spokeswoman Jennifer Zuccarelli.Tech inspired?The comments around AI from the largest U.S. banks mirror those from tech giants including Amazon and Microsoft, whose leaders have told their workforces to brace for AI-related disruptions, including hiring freezes and layoffs.Companies across sectors have become more blunt this year about the possible impacts of AI on employees as the technology's underlying models become more capable and as investors reward businesses seen as ahead on AI.In banking, the dominant thinking is that workers in operational roles, sometimes referred to as the back and middle office, are generally most exposed to job disruption from AI.For instance, in May a JPMorgan executive told investors that operations and support staff would fall by at least 10% over the next five years, even while business volumes grew, thanks to AI.At Goldman Sachs, Solomon seemed to warn the firm's 48,300 employees that the next few years might be uncomfortable for some.\"We don't take these decisions lightly, but this process is part of the long-term dynamism our shareholders, clients, and people expect of Goldman Sachs,\" he said in the memo. \"The firm has always been successful by not just adapting to change, but anticipating and embracing it.\"watch now",

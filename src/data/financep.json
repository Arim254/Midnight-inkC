Duffy and FAA Administrator Bryan Bedford hold a press conference at the U.S. Department of Transportation Headquarters on Nov. 5, 2025 in Washington, DC. Tasos Katopodis | Getty ImagesTransportation Secretary Sean Duffy announced Wednesday afternoon that he will be reducing flight capacity by 10% at 40 major airports starting Friday morning, affecting roughly 3,500 to 4,000 flights daily.It was not immediately clear which airports would be affected.\"This is proactive,\" Duffy said in a news conference.Federal Aviation Administration Administrator Bryan Bedford said additional measures could be taken after the initial reduction.\"As we slice the data more granularly, we are seeing pressures build in a way that we don't feel, if we allow it to go unchecked, will allow us to continue to tell the public that we operate the safest airline system in the world,\" Bedford said Wednesday.Bedford added that the administration will be meeting with the airline community to decide how to move forward on implementing the reduction, which he said has never happened before during his time in the industry.The government shutdown, which entered its 36th full day on Wednesday, is now the longest in U.S. history.Duffy said he expects more cancellations as a result of the reduction, which has no set end time. \"We thought 10% was the right number based on the pressure we were seeing,\" he said.People wait in a security checkpoint line at George Bush Intercontinental Airport in Houston, Texas, on November 4, 2025.Mark Felix | Afp | Getty ImagesThe move comes as air traffic controllers have missed their paychecks due to the government shutdown. Air traffic controllers and Transportation Security Administration screeners are among the essential government employees who are required to work during the shutdown.The closure has also raised concerns about already thin staffing among air traffic controllers, the FAA said. Insufficient staffing at some FAA facilities has disrupted some flights since Oct. 1.Earlier this week, Duffy told CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" that he could \"shut the whole airspace down\" if the shutdown drags on.On Wednesday morning, National Air Traffic Controllers Association President Nick Daniels told \"Squawk Box\" that it could take \"weeks to recover\" from the impacts of the government shutdown on air traffic controllers.",

    "body": "Peloton stationary bikes for sale at the company's showroom in Dedham, Massachusetts, U.S., on Wednesday, Feb. 3,  2021. Adam Glanzman | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesPeloton is recalling its original Bike+ after receiving reports that the seat post broke and detached from the equipment during use, leading to two injuries, the Consumer Product Safety Commission said in a news release Thursday. The recall impacts 833,000 units, touching every original Bike+ the company sold that was manufactured between 2019 and 2022. The bikes were sold between January 2020 and April 2025, but Peloton stopped manufacturing them in 2022. The recall comes after Peloton received two reports of injuries \"due to a fall\" after the post broke off, the CPSC said in its release. It received three reports in total about the issue.  The CPSC said consumers should immediately stop using the bikes and contact Peloton for free repair. The company is offering a free seat post that users can install at home, the agency said. In a statement Thursday, Peloton said, \"The integrity of our products and our Members' well-being are our top priorities.\" The company encouraged users to request the new part \"as soon as possible.\"The notice Thursday marks the second time Peloton has had to recall one of its bike models due to issues with the seat post. In May 2023, the company recalled every base Bike model that it ever sold, totaling 2.2 million units, after receiving 35 reports of the seat post breaking and detaching during use. The issue led to 13 injuries, including a fractured wrist, lacerations and bruises.At the time, the company said the recall led to higher-than-expected membership churn, as between 15,000 and 20,000 people paused their monthly subscriptions while waiting for the seat post to be replaced. Replacing the parts cost at least $40 million during its fiscal 2023 fourth quarter, the company said at the time. The recall Thursday, the fifth since Peloton's founding, comes as CEO Peter Stern looks to get the fitness company back to growth and move past the many issues it has faced since its founding. Changing consumer dynamics have plagued the company since the end of the Covid-19 pandemic, but so have its recalls, including one for its Tread+ treadmill in 2021 after a child was killed. Just over a month ago, Peloton relaunched its product assortment, raised prices and unveiled new features ahead of the crucial holiday shopping season. The current quarter is Peloton's biggest for hardware sales. The company is expected to report fiscal first-quarter 2026 earnings after the bell on Thursday.Clarification: This story was updated to clarify that the recall affects every original Bike+ sold that was manufactured between 2019 and 2022.",

    "body": "watch nowLayoff announcements soared in October as companies recalibrated staffing levels during the artificial intelligence boom, a sign of potential trouble ahead for the labor market, according to outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas.Job cuts for the month totaled 153,074, a 183% surge from September and 175% higher than the same month a year ago. It was the highest level for any October since 2003. This has been the worst year for announced layoffs since 2009.\"Like in 2003, a disruptive technology is changing the landscape,\" said Andy Challenger, workplace expert and chief revenue officer at the firm. \"At a time when job creation is at its lowest point in years, the optics of announcing layoffs in the fourth quarter are particularly unfavorable.\"The report provides a glimpse into the labor market at a time when the government has suspended data gathering and releases during the shutdown in Washington, D.C.To be sure, the Challenger monthly numbers can be highly volatile, and an accelerated pace of layoffs has yet to show up in state-level weekly jobless claim filings that continue to come in despite the shutdown. Payrolls processing firm ADP reported that October saw net job growth of 42,000, reversing two consecutive months of losses in the private sector.However, the report comes at a time when Federal Reserve officials have expressed concern about a softening labor market. The central bank has lowered its benchmark interest rate twice since September and is expected to approve another quarter percentage point reduction in December as policymakers look to get ahead of any more serious problems.Challenger reports the highest level of layoffs coming from the technology sector amid a time of restructuring due to AI integration. Companies in the sector announced 33,281 cuts, nearly six times the level in September.Consumer products also saw a sharp gain to 3,409, while nonprofits, an area hit hard by the shutdown, listed 27,651 cuts year to date, up 419% from the same point in 2024.In total, companies have announced 1.1 million cuts this year, a 65% increase from a year ago and the highest level since the Covid pandemic year of 2020. October saw the highest total for any month in the fourth quarter since 2008.\"Some industries are correcting after the hiring boom of the pandemic, but this comes as AI adoption, softening consumer and corporate spending, and rising costs drive belt-tightening and hiring freezes. Those laid off now are finding it harder to quickly secure new roles, which could further loosen the labor market,\" Challenger said.",

Big deals from Palo Alto Networks and Alphabet, and initial public offerings from Netskope and SailPoint have also put the sector in the spotlight.Toronto-based 1Password was founded in 2005 and counts IBM, Perplexity AI, Salesforce and the Golden State Warriors among its customers, and it's also signed a multiyear deal with Formula 1 team Oracle Red Bull Racing. The company says it secures more than 1.3 billion human and machine credentials and works with 180,000 business customers.Additionally, 1Password on Thursday announced it is bringing on former ChargePoint and Barracuda Networks executive Michael Hughes. Former Qualtrics and SAP executive John Torrey will join as chief business officer.Faugno said both executives complement the company's strategy to lure larger enterprise customers.Over the last year, 1Password has undergone a major C-suite shake-up.Longtime leader Jeff Shiner, who ran 1Password for 13 years, transitioned into executive chair of the board in July. Faugno, who had been promoted to co-CEO a few months earlier, took over the role solely at that time. Faugno joined 1Password in 2023 as president and operating chief.To date, 1Password has raised about $950 million and is valued at $6.8 billion, according to Pitchbook data. Other investors include actor Justin Timberlake, comedian Trevor Noah, CrowdStrike CEO George Kurtz and investment firm Iconiq, according to Pitchbook.Faugno told CNBC that the company is weighing a possible IPO in 2026 or 2027, but isn't \"rushing out to go public.\" He said 1Password remains focused on providing the best tools for its customers.\"We control our own destiny,\" he said. \"From a profitability perspective, we have investors that are playing the long game with us.\"WATCH: CrowdStrike CEO: Don't buy idea AI will kill software, need it to protect AIwatch now",

    "body": "Evan Spiegel, CEO of Snap Inc., attends the annual Allen and Co. Sun Valley Media and Technology Conference at the Sun Valley Resort in Sun Valley, Idaho, on July 9, 2025.David A. Grogan | CNBCSnap shares climbed 15% on Wednesday after the company issued its third-quarter earnings, reporting revenue that beat analysts expectations and a $500 million stock repurchase program.Here is how the company did compared with Wall Street's expectations:Earnings per share: Loss of 6 cents. That figure is not comparable to analysts' estimates.Revenue: $1.51 billion vs. $1.49 billion expected, according to LSEG Global daily active users: 477 million vs. 476 million expected, according to StreetAccountGlobal average revenue per user (ARPU): $3.16 vs. $3.13 expected, according to StreetAccountSnap also announced that it is partnering with the startup Perplexity AI, which \"will integrate its conversational search directly into Snapchat.\" The feature is set to appear in Snapchat starting in early 2026, Snap said.\"Perplexity will pay Snap $400 million over one year, through a combination of cash and equity, as we achieve global rollout,\" Snap said in a letter to investors. \"Revenue from the partnership is expected to begin contributing in 2026.\"The partnership represents \"a first step in Snap's effort to make Snapchat a platform where leading AI companies can connect with its global community in creative and trusted ways,\" the two companies said in their announcement.In the company's earnings call, Snap CEO Evan Spiegel said Perplexity will have \"default placement in our chat inbox\" and the startup will \"control the responses from their chatbot inside of Snapchat.\" Although Snap will not be selling \"advertising against the Perplexity responses,\" Spiegel said that the integration \"will help Perplexity drive additional subscribers, which I think is something that will be valuable to their business.\"\"We have a really unique opportunity ahead to help distribute AI agents through our chat interface,\" Spiegel said.While Snapchat users will still be able to engage with the company's My AI chatbot, the integrated Perplexity AI service will provide them with \"real-time answers from credible sources and explore new topics within the app,\" the companies said.Regarding Snap's expensive foray into developing augmented reality glasses, Spiegel said the company plans to create a separate subsidiary around the Specs AR glasses to speed up development with partners.Snap said fourth-quarter sales will come in between $1.68 billion and $1.71 billion. That figure's midpoint of $1.695 billion is slightly ahead of Wall Street expectations of $1.69 billion.For the third quarter, Snap said sales grew 10% year over year while it logged a net loss of $104 million. During the same quarter last year, Snap recorded a net loss of $153 million.The Snapchat parent said that third-quarter adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA, came in at $182 million, ahead of the $125 million that StreetAccount was projecting.The company also said that its adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter will be between $280 million and $310 million, which tops StreetAccount's projections of $255.4 million.Snap shares were down 32% for the year, as of Wednesday's close, compared to the Nasdaq's 22% gain.Although the company's shares soared as high as 25% in after-hours trading on Wednesday, they began their descent after Snap finance chief Derek Andersen detailed some of the company's sales-related challenges on the earnings call.\"The North America LCS segment remains the primary headwind to our overall revenue growth,\" said Andersen, adding that the company is seeing more growth and demand for Snap's ad products from small-to-medium sized businesses in other regions.In the letter to investors, Snap said that government regulations like Australia's social media minimum age bill and related policy developments \"are likely to have negative impacts on user engagement metrics that we cannot currently predict.\"\"While we remain committed to our goal of serving 1 billion global monthly active users, we expect overall DAU may decline in Q4 given these internal and external factors, and as noted above we expect particularly negative impacts in certain jurisdictions,\" Snap said in the letter.The Australian senate passed the bill in November 2024, and when the law comes into effect next month, companies like Facebook and Instagram parent Meta, TikTok and Snap will be penalized if they fail to adequately prevent children under 16 from possessing accounts on their respective platforms.Snap also said in the investor letter that the \"upcoming rollout of platform-level age verification\" from companies like Apple and Google could also negatively impact user metrics in the future.  Utah and California have signed online-child safety bills that put the onus on app store makers to verify user ages. Utah's law is set to fully take effect in May 2026.\"We are also preparing for the upcoming rollout of platform-level age verification, which will use new signals provided by Apple — and soon Google — to help us better determine the age of our users and remove those we learn are under 13,\" Snap said in the letter.Snap's warning to investors underscores how new laws, policies and regulations around the globe are beginning to impact tech firms.In the letter, Snap also said that some of its efforts to improve monetization, such as its Snapchat+ subscription service, could result in \"adverse impact on engagement metrics as these experiences are rolled out globally.\"Pinterest shares tanked on Tuesday after the company reported third-quarter results that missed on earnings per share and provided weaker-than-expected guidance. The company's finance chief Julia Donnelly told analysts that Pinterest expects \"broader trends and market uncertainty continuing with the addition of a new tariff in Q4 impacting the home furnishing category.\"Big tech companies like Meta, Alphabet and Amazon reported their latest quarterly earnings last week in which they posted solid digital advertising sales and hefty spending on AI-related computing infrastructure.The Facebook-parent saw third-quarter sales boom 26% year-over-year to $51.24 billion, while revenue in Amazon's online ad unit soared 24% year-over-year to $17.7 billion.Alphabet said that its total advertising revenue for the third quarter rose 13% year-over-year to $74.18 billion, while YouTube's online ad sales climbed 15% to $10.26 billion.Reddit said last Thursday that third-quarter sales surged 68% year-over-year to $585 million. The company's global daily active uniques increased 19% year-over-year to 116 million, surpassing estimates of 114 million. WATCH: It would be irresponsible of Zuckerberg to not spend on his network of properties, says Jim Cramer.",

The dismissal comes more than a year after Boeing and the DOJ said they had reached an agreement that required the company to plead guilty and serve a term of probation.The first crash, of Lion Air Flight 610 in Indonesia occurred in late October 2018, and the second crash, of Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302, occurred nearly five months later, in March 2019.O'Connor, in his dismissal order, said that victim families who opposed the dismissal \"are correct\" that a non-prosecution agreement that the DOJ reached with Boeing \"fails to secure the necessary accountability to ensure the safety of the flying public.\"O'Connor agreed with them that the agreement \"disregards the need for Boeing to be subject to independent monitoring.\"Boeing on Wednesday reached settlements in three lawsuits filed by families of victims of the second crash, after a jury had been selected for the trial of one of those cases in Chicago federal court.The DOJ criminally charged Boeing in January 2021 with conspiracy to defraud the United States for the company's alleged obstruction of the Federal Aviation Administration's evaluation of the Max's maneuvering characteristics augmentation system. At the same time that case was filed, the DOJ said it had entered into a deferred prosecution agreement with Boeing, which effectively suspended the case's prosecution.But in May 2024, the DOJ told O'Connor that Boeing had breached the deferred prosecution deal by \"failing to design, implement, and enforce a compliance and ethics program to prevent and detect violations of U.S. fraud laws throughout its operations.\"This is breaking news.

    "body": "Jensen Huang attends a reception for the 2025 Queen Elizabeth Prize for Engineering, at St James' Palace in London, Brirain, Nov. 5, 2025.  Yui Mok | Via ReutersNvidia CEO Jensen Huang reportedly told the Financial Times on Wednesday that \"China is going to win the AI race,\" only to release a notably softer statement soon after. The prolific tech leader was speaking on the sidelines of the FT's Future of AI Summit, where he warned that China would beat the U.S. in artificial intelligence thanks to lower energy costs and looser regulations.The comments, which CNBC could not verify independently, would represent Huang's starkest warning yet that the U.S. is at risk of losing its global lead in advanced AI technologies. However, several hours after the FT published its report, Nvidia issued a separate statement from Jensen on an official X account. \"As I have long said, China is nanoseconds behind America in AI. It's vital that America wins by racing ahead and winning developers worldwide,\" he added.Huang has long stated that the U.S. can stay ahead in the AI race if it keeps developers reliant on Nvidia's leading AI chips — an argument the CEO has used to lobby against export restrictions on his company's sales to China. Following meetings with U.S. President Donald Trump in July, it seemed that Huang's efforts had paid off, with Washington agreeing to ease some of its chip curbs. Under the plan, Nvidia and competing AI chip company AMD had agreed to pay the U.S. government 15% of their Chinese revenues from sales of existing AI processors tailored for the market.However, Beijing has since shut Nvidia out of the market as it conducts a national security review of its chips, with Huang stating that the firm's market share has been reduced to zero. It remains unclear whether China will allow any of Nvidia's chips to return, as officials push domestic tech companies towards its domestic AI chip alternatives. However, some experts have speculated that Beijing is using Nvidia's market access as leverage in trade negotiations or to push Washington for wider access to advanced semiconductors.Huang was in South Korea last month, during Trump's meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping. Highly anticipated trade talks between the two leaders did not yield any concessions from either side on chip policy. According to The Wall Street Journal, Trump had initially sought to discuss a request by Huang to allow sales of a new generation of AI chips to China. However, top officials rallied against the idea, the Journal reported, citing anonymous current and former administration officials familiar with the matter.Now that Nvidia's access to China remains frozen, it appears Huang is shifting his attention to other matters he considers essential to Nvidia's growth and the AI race. In the interview with the FT, Huang reportedly expressed concerns that the West, including the U.S, was being held back by \"cynicism\" and excessive regulation — contrasting that with China's energy subsidies aimed at lowering costs for local developers using domestic chips.",

    "body": "Brand new Lucid electric cars sit parked in front of a Lucid Studio showroom in San Francisco on May 24, 2024.Justin Sullivan | Getty ImagesDETROIT – Lucid Group missed Wall Street's expectations for a second consecutive quarter as the all-electric vehicle maker continues to address problems with the launch of its new flagship Gravity SUV.The company, for a second consecutive quarter, also cut the high end of its annual production guidance to around 18,000 vehicles from a previous forecast of between 18,000 and 20,000 units. Its original target for this year was 20,000 units. It also reduced the low end target of its capital expenditures by $100 million to between $1 billion and $1.2 billion.Here's how the company performed in the third quarter, compared with average estimates compiled by LSEG:Loss per share: $2.65 adjusted vs. a loss of $2.27 expectedRevenue: $336.6 million vs. $379.1 million expectedLucid reported a net loss for the quarter of $978.4 million, or $3.31 per share, compared with a net loss of $992.5 million, or $4.09 per share, in the same period last year. Adjusting for one-time items including restructuring, the company lost $2.65 a share.The company's adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization was a loss of $717.7 million vs. an expected loss of $597.4 million, according to estimates compiled by StreetAccount. That loss widened year-over-over by 17%. Its quarterly revenue increased roughly 68% from $200 million a year earlier. Its quarterly revenue increased roughly 68% from $200 million a year earlier.In addition to releasing its third-quarter results, Lucid said it has agreed to increase a delayed draw term loan credit facility from $750 million to roughly $2 billion from Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund, the company's largest shareholder.The company reported total liquidity of $5.5 billion to end the quarter, including the undrawn credit line. Its cash and cash equivalents were roughly flat from the end of last year at $1.6 billion, with a total financial runway into the first half of 2027, the company said.Lucid also said it continues to evaluate finance and liquidity options outside of the PIF as it launches its Gravity SUV and develops an upcoming midsize vehicle, which isn't expected to start production until at least late next year.An autonomous robotaxi from Uber's partnership with Lucid and autonomous vehicle startup, Nuro.Courtesy: Nick Twork | LucidRegarding Gravity, Lucid interim CEO Marc Winterhoff said the company \"remains intensely focused on ramping up production and addressing the significant supply chain disruptions impacting the entire industry.\"During the company's last quarterly results in August, Winterhoff admitted there were problems with Gravity, saying the company planned to significantly increase production during the second half of the year.Winterhoff told investors Wednesday that the company continues to believe it can achieve a significant increase in Gravity deliveries during the fourth quarter, despite the supply chain issues and an industrywide slowdown in EV demand. Lucid CFO Taoufiq Boussaid said Gravity production increased quarter-to-quarter but remains at an unmeaningful level.The earnings results come roughly a month after Lucid reported third-quarter vehicle deliveries of 4,078 units, which increased from a year earlier but also fell slightly short of Wall Street expectations.Lucid has made several partnership announcements this year. In July, it signed a $300 million deal with Uber that included the ride-hailing platform acquiring and deploying more than 20,000 Lucid Gravity SUVs over the next six years that will be equipped with autonomous vehicle technology from startup Nuro. More recently, it announced an expanded partnership with Nvidia for autonomous vehicle technologies.Lucid's results are in stark contrast to fellow pure EV company Rivian Automotive, which on Tuesday reported third-quarter earnings and revenue that topped Wall Street expectations and drove the stock price up during intraday trading Wednesday.Shares of Rivian — following near-record gains Wednesday — are up roughly 16% in 2025, while Lucid remains off more than 40%, including a 1-for-10 reverse stock split this summer.",

    "body": "The ESPN Bet logo on a laptop arranged in New York, US, on Thursday, Feb. 22, 2024. Gabby Jones | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesDisney's ESPN is swapping out its sports betting partner.In separate releases Thursday, the company said it was terminating its agreement with Penn Entertainment years earlier than planned and had signed an agreement with DraftKings to make it the exclusive official sportsbook and odds provider for ESPN.Both changes take effect in December.\"Our betting approach has focused on offering an integrated experience within our products,\" ESPN Chariman Jimmy Pitaro said in a statement. \"Working with DraftKings, a leader in the space, will allow us to build upon that foundation, continue to super-serve passionate sports fans and grow our ESPN direct-to-consumer business.\"Under the partnership, DraftKings will power ESPN's mobile betting tab.\"ESPN's unmatched visibility across the world of sports make this collaboration a natural fit,\" said DraftKings CEO Jason Robins in a statement. \"As an innovative leader in digital sports entertainment, DraftKings is uniquely positioned to integrate our technology and products with ESPN's iconic brand and storytelling power.\"ESPN inked its previous deal with Penn in 2023 after spending some time looking for a gambling partner. Disney had made clear in the past it would never take bets directly, making a partnership the only viable path for ESPN to get into the booming online sports gambling industry.Sports betting has become an integral part of ESPN's direct-to-consumer streaming platform.ESPN and Penn's partnership allowed for ESPN to rebrand and relaunch Penn's sportsbook — then known as Barstool Sportsbook — as ESPN Bet.The agreement had a 10-year term but allowed for either ESPN or Penn to end the agreement after the third year \"if specific market share performance thresholds were not met,\" according to the news release.And on Thursday, Penn and ESPN announced they had agreed to wind down the partnership after just two years. Penn's sportsbook will be rebranded again as theScore Bet.\"When we first announced our partnership with ESPN, both sides made it clear that we expected to compete for a podium position in the space,\" said Penn CEO Jay Snowden in a news release.\"Although we made significant progress in improving our product offering and building a cohesive ecosystem with ESPN, we have mutually and amicably agreed to wind down our collaboration,\" he said.Under the original deal, ESPN agreed to provide Penn with the exclusive right to its brand for the sportsbook, as well as media and marketing services. In exchange, Penn agreed to pay ESPN $1.5 billion in cash over the 10-year period, and also granted ESPN about $500 million of warrants to buy roughly 31.8 million Penn common shares that would vest over the same period.On Thursday the companies said Penn's $150 million in yearly cash payments will cease in the fourth quarter, as would the warrants to buy Penn's common stock.",

That compares with other car retailer stocks being up double digits, including a 52% increase this year for online used car retailer Carvana.Nash on CarMax's most recent quarterly earnings call in September admitted that results that \"fell short\" of the company's expectations, as well as Wall Street's. The results included notable declines in nearly all key earnings including sales, net earnings and gross profit.Those September results led to a significant decline in shares of the company and negative analyst reactions, including a $24 price cut by Morgan Stanley.CarMax is scheduled to report its current fiscal quarter results on Dec. 18.",

    "body": "The Vogtle nuclear power plant is located in Burke County, near Waynesboro, Georgia in USA. Each of the two existing units have a Westinghouse pressurized water reactor (PWR), with a General Electric turbine and electric generator, producing approximately 2,400 MW of electricity. Two Westinghouse made AP 1000 reactors are under construction here.Pallava Bagla | Corbis News | Getty ImagesThe Trump administration's plan to spend tens of billions of dollars on Westinghouse nuclear plants could transform it into an independent, publicly traded company with the U.S. government as a major shareholder.The Commerce Department signed a deal last week with Westinghouse owners Cameco and Brookfield Asset Management to spend $80 billion to build the company's nuclear plants across the U.S.Under the deal, the U.S. government is granted a participation interest in Westinghouse and can require an initial public offering on or before January 2029 if the company's value surges to $30 billion or more.The government could become an 8% shareholder in Westinghouse under this scenario, said Cameco Chief Operating Officer Grant Isaac on the company's third-quarter earnings call Wednesday. It is not entitled to a stake in Cameco or Brookfield under the deal, Isaac said.Cameco would consider spinning out Westinghouse as an independent company in 2029 depending on the circumstances, the executive said.\"There is definitely a unique interest in investing just in Westinghouse,\" Isaac said. \"Cameco is a funny proxy for that. Brookfield's probably an even funnier proxy to invest in just Westinghouse.\"Cameco is one of the largest uranium miners in the world and Brookfield is one of the biggest investors in energy generation.\"We're going to keep all options on the table,\" Isaac said. \"This partnership agreement does not force us to leave Westinghouse in 2029. We don't have to sell any of our share — or we may if the value of Westinghouse is so significant come 2029 when that window opens up.\"U.S. government financingThe government's interest in Westinghouse vests only if it makes a final investment decision with definitive agreements to build new reactors in the U.S. with a total value of $80 billion.The U.S. could use tools like Department of Energy loans or financing from \"other jurisdictions\" to finance the projects among other options, Isaac said.\"We're assured that there is a lot of interest in investing this minimum $80 billion in order to begin the process,\" the executive said.Westinghouse has designed a big modern nuclear reactor called the AP1000 that the Trump administration wants to deploy across the U.S. to meet rising electricity demand from data centers and manufacturing. It generates a gigawatt of electricity, which is enough power for more than 750,000 homes.President Donald Trump signed an executive order in May that called for the U.S. to start construction on 10 large new nuclear reactors by 2030. Westinghouse CEO Dan Sumner said in July that the company would meet Trump's call with the AP1000.But Westinghouse has struggled in the past to deliver the AP1000 on time and on budget. It went bankrupt in 2017 from cost overruns at big nuclear projects in Georgia and South Carolina.The first two AP1000 reactors in the U.S. came online at Plant Vogtle in Georgia in 2023 and 2024 but the South Carolina project was canceled.Westinghouse was bought by Brookfield and Cameco in 2023, five years after it emerged from bankruptcy. Brookfield has a 51% stake in Westinghouse and Cameco owns 49% of it.The nuclear industry needs a big order of reactors to stimulate the market and supply chains, Isaac said. The U.S. government is serving that role, the executive said.\"What the U.S. government has done is committed to step in and be that stimulant if you will, their commitment is to facilitate the financing,\" he said.",

    "body": "Eli Lilly Biotechnology Center is shown in San Diego, California, March 1, 2023.Mike Blake | ReutersEli Lilly on Thursday said it will start late-stage trials on its experimental amylin obesity drug next month after it showed encouraging results in a mid-stage study.The highest dose of the weekly injection, called eloralintide, helped patients with obesity or who are overweight lose 20.1% of their body weight on average at 48 weeks. The results support the pharmaceutical giant's efforts to bring next-generation treatments to the blockbuster weight loss drug market, and solidify its dominance in the segment. The data bolsters Eli Lilly's chances of bringing a strong competitor to the red-hot amylin space, in particular. Many industry analysts view so-called amylin analogs as the next wave of obesity treatments that could serve as an alternative or complementary option to existing injections targeting gut hormone GLP-1. Several large drugmakers such as Roche and AbbVie have shelled out billions to buy or license experimental amylin treatments, and Novo Nordisk is developing its own drugs. Novo Nordisk — Eli Lilly's chief rival in the obesity market — and Pfizer are also in the midst of a heated takeover war over Metsera, whose pipeline includes a potential once-monthly amylin drug. Amylin analogs mimic a hormone co-secreted with insulin in the pancreas to suppress appetite and reduce food intake. Amylin treatments have a similar effect to GLP-1s like Lilly's Zepbound and Mounjaro, but some analysts and researchers say it could be easier for patients to tolerate and help them preserve lean muscle mass. The lowest dose of Eli Lilly's injection helped people lose 9.5% of their weight at 48 weeks, compared to 0.4% among those who received a placebo. Patients who used a two-step dose escalation – starting at a 6 milligram dose and increasing to a 9 milligram dose – lost 19.9% of their weight at 48 weeks. People who used a three-step dose escalation that started at 3 milligrams lost 16.4% of their weight.The most common side effects of the injection were mild to moderate gastrointestinal symptoms and fatigue, which were observed more frequently in patients who took higher doses of the drug, according to Eli Lilly. Patients in groups that gradually increased doses of the drug saw lower side effects. The company has yet to release detailed data on side effect rates and how many patients discontinued the treatment during the trial. Eli Lilly will present the data at the ObesityWeek scientific conference in Atlanta on Thursday.",

    "body": "Chipotle Mexican Grill and Coach store logos.Getty ImagesChipotle and Cava pinned weaker sales on younger customers who are pulling back and packing lunches.But Gen Z shoppers are still spending on Coach handbags to bring to work — even if they're skipping bowls and burritos.Coach's parent company Tapestry raised its full-year outlook Thursday, after beating Wall Street's expectations for quarterly earnings and revenue and posting double-digit sales gains in North America.In an interview with CNBC, Tapestry CEO Joanne Crevoiserat said the company's sales in the quarter were fueled by attracting new customers, particularly within Gen Z.The company, which also includes Kate Spade, acquired over 2.2 million new customers globally in its fiscal 2026 first quarter, driven by growth in Gen Z consumers compared to the prior year. The company said that generation, which is typically defined as spanning in age from roughly 13 to 29, accounted for about 35% of new customers.\"The Gen Z consumer, specifically, is highly fashion engaged, spending slightly more of their budget on fashion,\" she said.Blurred pedestrians walk past an illuminated Coach New York logo at a storefront in a shopping mall, on June 23, 2025 in Chongqing, China.Cheng Xin | Getty ImagesShe added those younger customers have a high retention rate, \"maybe busting a myth that these customers, Gen Z customers, aren't sticky or loyal.\"Here's what the company reported for the fiscal first quarter compared with what Wall Street expected, according to a survey of analysts by LSEG:Earnings per share: $1.38 vs. $1.26 expectedRevenue: $1.70 vs. $1.64 billion expectedTapestry's net income in the three-month period that ended Sept. 27 rose to $274.8 million, or $1.28 per share, compared with $186.6 million, or 79 cents per share, in the year-ago period.It hiked its full-year outlook for both sales and profits, saying it now expects revenue around $7.3 billion for the year, which would be 4% or 5% growth from the prior year, compared to its prior expectations of nearly $7.2 billion. For earnings per diluted share, it now expects a range of $5.45 to $5.60, higher than its prior guidance of $5.30 to $5.45.Despite the raised forecast and better than-expected quarterly results, Tapestry's shares fell about 9% in premarket trading.With its Gen Z strength, Tapestry defied some other companies' assessments on the health of younger shoppers.Cava saw demand among the 25- to 34-year-old consumers fall as the fast-casual chain entered its current quarter, CFO Tricia Tolivar said in an interview with CNBC. She attributed a pullback to younger diners' higher unemployment rate, their greater likelihood of facing the student loan repayments that resumed in the spring and tariffs creating \"an overall fog for the consumer.\"Chipotle's CEO Scott Boatwright similarly said the chain is seeing younger diners visit less frequently, especially those between the ages of 25 and 35 years old.And some holiday forecasts have also reflected a predicted drop in spending by Gen Z. According to consulting firm PwC's holiday survey, Gen Z plans to cut average holiday spending the most among generations surveyed compared to the year-ago period — with respondents in that age group saying they plan to spend 23% less.Deloitte found a similar trend, with Gen Z consumers saying in its separate survey that they plan to spend an average of 34% less this holiday season than a year ago. Weakness carried into the next oldest generation, as millennials — respondents between ages 29 and 44 in the poll — said they expect to spend an average of 13% less this holiday season.— CNBC's Amelia Lucas contributed to this report",

    "body": "U.S. Representative Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) takes the stage on Day 3 of the Democratic National Convention (DNC) at the United Center, in Chicago, Illinois, U.S., August 21, 2024.Kevin Wurm | ReutersNancy Pelosi, the California Democrat who made history as the first female speaker of the House of Representatives, said Thursday she will not seek reelection to Congress next year.Pelosi, 85, has served in the House for nearly four decades, presiding over the passage of major legislation and serving as a leading opposition figure against President Donald Trump.\"There has been no greater honor for me than to stand on the House floor and say, 'I speak for the people of San Francisco,'\" Pelosi said in a video posted on social media.\"I have truly loved serving as your voice in Congress,\" she said. \"That is why I want you, my fellow San Franciscans, to be the first to know: I will not be seeking reelection to Congress.\"\"With a grateful heart, I look forward to my final year of service as your proud representative,\" Pelosi said.Pelosi became the most powerful woman in congressional history in 2002, when she was elected House minority leader by her fellow Democrats.When the party took majority control of the chamber in 2007, Pelosi became the first — and so far only — woman to wield the speaker's gavel.She held the title until Democrats lost their House majority in 2011. When the party won the chamber back in 2019, Pelosi served as House speaker for a second time.After Republicans regained majority control of the House following the 2022 midterm elections, Pelosi stepped aside as the Democrats' leader. But she remained in Congress, and was referred to as speaker emerita.The new Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi (Left) (D-Ca.) waves the gavel after receiving it from John Boehner (R-OH) on Jan 4th, 2007.The Washington Post | The Washington Post | Getty Images\"Nancy Pelosi has inspired generations,\" California Gov. Gavin Newsom said in an X post later Thursday morning. \"Her courage and conviction to San Francisco, California, and our nation has set the standard for what public service should be. Her impact on this nation is unmatched,\" Newsom said.Trump slammed Pelosi following her retirement announcement, calling it \"a great thing for America.\" \"She was evil, corrupt and only focused on bad things for our country,\" Trump told a Fox News reporter. She was rapidly losing control of her party and it was never coming back. I'm very honored she impeached me twice and failed miserably twice. Nancy Pelosi is a highly overrated politician.\"Under Pelosi's leadership, the House passed seismic bills that created sweeping change across the country.Perhaps most notably, she was instrumental to the passage of the Affordable Care Act, former President Barack Obama's signature legislative achievement. The health care law, which has survived numerous attempts by Republicans to repeal it, is now at the center of an ongoing government shutdown.During her second stint as speaker, Pelosi clashed openly with Trump — inside and outside the White House.In a heated clash at a White House meeting in 2019 on the administration's withdrawal of troops from Syria, Pelosi stood up and raised a finger to Trump. The then-president released a photo of the moment, claiming Pelosi had an \"unhinged meltdown\" — but Pelosi embraced the image, displaying it atop her Twitter profile.President Donald Trump meets with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Congressional leadership Wednesday Oct. 16 2019 in the Cabinet Room of the White House.. (Photo by: Hum Images/Universal Images Group via Getty Images)Hum Images | Universal Images Group | Getty ImagesPelosi also presided over the first impeachment of Trump in the House in December 2019. The charges of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress stemmed from accusations that Trump had pressured Ukraine's president to launch investigations into his political foes.Trump was acquitted in the Senate.Pelosi has remained a vocal Trump critic. In a recent CNN interview, she called Trump a \"vile creature\" and \"worst thing on the face of the Earth.\"This is breaking news. Please refresh for updates.",

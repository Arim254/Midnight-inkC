    "body": "Former U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris attends the 56th NAACP Image Awards at the Pasadena Civic Auditorium in Pasadena, California, U.S. February 22, 2025.Etienne Laurent | ReutersFormer Vice President Kamala Harris said that during her career, she never took \"no\" for an answer — and attributed much of her success to this attitude.Harris, who served as vice president of the United States under President Joe Biden from 2021 to 2025, shared some candid insights about her early career on Steven Bartlett's Diary of a CEO podcast.When asked what she was like as a 25-year-old prosecutor, Harris responded: \"She was fearless. She didn't hear 'no it can't be done.'\"Harris recalled the first case she had as a young prosecutor: it was a Friday evening, and the person who had been arrested was a young woman with children at home.\"All the courts were shutting down and I went to the courtroom, and I asked the judge: 'Please take the bench again. She has young children. She can't stay in over the weekend,'\" Harris said.\"And the clerk was like: 'no, he's gone for the day. He's leaving for the day.' And I would not leave, and they called the case.\"This persistence has served Harris well throughout her career. She became the first Black, South Asian American, and female vice president after serving as a U.S. senator and attorney general in California.\"Not hearing no, that has probably been a throughline of my life. I don't rest easy with the idea that something is not possible, at least I don't rest easy with the idea without trying to show that it is possible and that's probably not changed,\" she added.In 2024, Harris replaced Biden as the Democratic presidential nominee after he dropped out of the race, but lost to President Donald Trump.Overcoming imposter syndromeHarris admitted that she experienced imposter syndrome in her career, especially when she was first elected district attorney in 2004.\"And there I was, sitting in the office, and I thought: 'Oh my god, I'm now the elected DA of a major city in the United States,'\" the former vice president said on the podcast, adding that she felt a great responsibility in her role.However, she put a positive spin on imposter syndrome, saying there's nothing wrong with having a little humility.\"I think there is a lot that is good with having a certain level of humility, and in particular when the people have vested you with great power, to understand that it's not about you. I think that is part and parcel of what we call imposter syndrome ... I think often it is because they understand how serious the job is on behalf of others, and I applaud a bit of honest humility, not feigned humility, \" she said.At other points in the podcast, Harris recalled walking into meetings and people wondering where her boss was. She said that deprioritizing other people's opinions greatly benefited her.\"When I'm mentoring people, I will often say to them: 'Don't ever limit yourself based on other people's limited ability to see who you are,\" she added.  \"That's their limitation… don't impose those limitations on yourself.\"",

    "body": "Man and woman having a small business meeting in smart casual clothesIppei Naoi | Moment | Getty ImagesOne successful angel investor has revealed two red flags that prevent him from investing in a founder in the first meeting.Carles Reina is an angel investor who backed voice cloning AI startup Eleven Labs when it was still in its very early stages in 2022. The firm was co-founded by Mati Staniszewski and Piotr Dąbkowski, and raised $180 million at a valuation of $3.3 billion, in its Series C funding earlier this year.In September, the company announced it was letting employees sell shares at a $6.6 billion valuation. Reina is now a vice president of revenue at the AI firm.When Reina first met Eleven Lab's co-founder Staniszewski, he told CNBC Make It that nobody wanted to invest in voice AI at the time. However, Reina decided to take a chance on Eleven Labs after just one meeting.\"We started talking, and within 30 minutes of the first conversation, I told him, 'How much money do you want?'\" Reina shared.He explained that the first meeting is critical when making a decision and Staniszewski displayed certain traits that attracted him as an investor.\"If the first signs are just not there, I usually don't want to waste anyone's time… I think you end up optimizing always for high quality interactions, [it's] like you're trying to triage if this is something that you really like and that you want to spend more time with the founders or not.\"Reina opened up about two reasons why he wouldn't want to invest in a founder after a first meeting.Two red flagsOne of the key traits that Reina looks for when meeting a founder is technicality.\"This is very personal, especially in different stages. But for me, if one of the founders is not technical, like literally cannot build products, is not a researcher or something like that, I just don't see the value in that because they're not going to be able to move as quickly,\" he said in the interview.Reina saw this quality in Eleven Lab's Staniszewski, who has a first-class honors degree in mathematics from Imperial College London.\"It was really interesting to see he was thinking about the problems of the entire ecosystem before even actually having any product, or before even actually talking to any real potential customer,\" he said.The second red flag is if the founder is trying to build a company in a \"very crowded market\" which Reina often tries to steer clear of.\"if there is a lot of venture capitalists looking at that market, because it is sexy, I'm just not interested because then valuations skyrocket and you end up going into a pricing war where everyone's trying to give them term sheets and so on,\" he said.When too many VCs want to invest in a company, it inflates the valuation of that company which then puts unnecessary pressure on the founders to show rapid growth and maintain or increase that valuation, according to Reina.Other reasons might be that the founder is in an industry he just isn't interested in and it doesn't fit his profile of investments.\"If someone sends me a pitch, or I get introduced to someone that just doesn't really bring my attention straight away, I will tell them straight away 'happy to help you on anything that you need [but] from an angel perspective or investing perspective, it's just not one of my things.'\"",

    "body": "Ellen and Edward earn $28,000 a month, or an annual income of around $336,000 a year — more than triple their home state of Hawaii's median household income.But their high income doesn't prevent the couple from having constant financial disagreements, they told money expert, author and self-made millionaire Ramit Sethi on a recent episode of his Money for Couples podcast. Their last names were not used.Edward is terrified of ever returning to a poor financial situation similar to what he grew up in, while Ellen wants the freedom to reasonably spend their money without asking permission, they said.\"We are pretty financially well-off, and my brain does not compute that,\" Edward said on the podcast. \"Everything for me is a fire. A blown tire that's $200, $300 is a huge deal for me.\"It's not just emergencies, either. Edward oversees the all of couple's finances, and Ellen said she has to get his approval to buy virtually anything, even everyday beauty products or essentials like her prenatal vitamins.\"I feel like every time I ask for anything ... I have to over-explain why I need it for him to say yes,\" Ellen said. \"That constant, 'let me ask,' 'let's see what he says,' 'let me go in detail about why I need it,' is not a good feeling.\"Here's why their disagreements keep happening and Sethi's advice for how to manage money together better.How to manage money as a coupleEllen and Edward aren't bad partners, Sethi said. \"More likely, it's [a] bad structure\" for how they manage their money.The couple understands some basics of setting up a financial system that works for both of them, Sethi said, like the idea that they should have money dedicated to discretionary spending. However, Edward has been including items like prenatal vitamins in Ellen's discretionary spending, which Sethi strongly disagreed with.\"You don't just need a better budget. In fact, you probably don't even need a budget at all,\" Sethi said. \"You need a better system that is built together.\"For both partners to start feeling better about money and hopefully have fewer disagreements going forward, Sethi offered three pieces of advice — and anyone in a similar situation can follow them.1. Encourage your partner to engage with your finances In Edward and Ellen's situation, Edward handles all of the money, while Ellen is hands off. But as spouses and co-parents, both parties need to be treated as equals, Sethi said.Sethi suggests the partner who has more experience with managing the household budget — Edward, in this case — encourage the other to get involved. He recommends telling yourself from \"day one,\" \"I am not going to do this on my own. I want my partner to become good with money.\"2. Talk about money regularlyIn the past, Ellen has avoided money conversations because she felt like her needs were dismissed and she didn't understand where Edward was coming from when he worried about their finances. Having regular money conversations could help them clear up miscommunications going forward and allow both partners to feel empowered to make decisions on how the family spends their money, Sethi said. 3. Find a structure that works for both partnersEllen and Edward's current system, in which Edward approves all of the couple's spending, isn't working for both of them. Sethi suggested they adopt a new structure together. One idea: They could each have \"no-questions-asked money\" along with a joint account and work together to decide how much goes in each, Sethi said.Additionally, they should create some general rules for money in their relationship, such as a no-debt policy or a limit on how long to spend flipping a house, which has been a point of contention in the past.The couple needs to make a more concerted effort to work together and create a shared vision for their money or else they'll \"forever feel resentful, behind, insecure, unworthy, misaligned, sometimes even in danger around your finances,\" Sethi said. \"Money is important,\" he added. \"My wish for you is that you give it the attention and respect that it deserves.\"Want to level up your AI skills? Sign up for Smarter by CNBC Make It's new online course, How To Use AI To Communicate Better At Work.

    "body": "Desmond Lim, co-founder and CEO of Workstream.Courtesy of Desmond LimIt's often said that \"there's no such thing as balance\" in entrepreneurship, but startup founder Desmond Lim disagrees.The CEO and co-founder of Workstream, a HR, payroll and hiring platform for hourly workers, says that balance isn't just possible — it's also necessary.Running a company can be very taxing, said Lim, who works about 11 hours a day on average.Not only are the hours long, but it can also be mentally consuming. \"The emotional ups and downs are always very challenging ... The highs are very high, the lows are very low,\" said Lim.\"Every year, you still think the company could die. And then I just try to remind myself ... you are still alive, healthy, everything is good,\" he said. \"And the other thing is, you cannot stop thinking about work. I dream about it.\"That's why Lim believes it's crucial for entrepreneurs to protect their health and energy. His strategy? Sticking to a fixed daily schedule that works best for his body and brain. \"My advice is, find your own rhythm,\" the 39-year-old said.I try to get the non-negotiables out [of the way] in the early morning. For me, it's sports.Desmond LimCo-founder and CEO, WorkstreamMixing two kinds of schedulesLim follows what he calls a \"dual schedule,\" inspired by an essay by Paul Graham, the co-founder of the startup accelerator Y Combinator.Graham's essay breaks down two types of time management: a manager's schedule — typically packed with back-to-back, hour-long meetings — and a maker's schedule, designed for creators like programmers or writers who thrive working in long, uninterrupted stretches to focus and build.\"I actually like to have my schedule mixed ... I like to have calls, deep work, calls, deep work,\" said Lim. Rather than sticking strictly to one style, Lim said he thrives by mixing both and following his own rhythm.Here's what Lim's weekday typically looks like:6:30 a.m.: Wake up7:00 a.m.to 8:30 a.m.: Exercise or sports8:30 a.m.to 9:30 a.m.: Protein shake and get ready for work9:30 a.m.: Arrive at work9:30 a.m.to 10:30 a.m.: Plan out the day and clear some to-do items10:30 a.m.to 12:30 p.m.: Meetings12:30 p.m. to 1:00 p.m.: Lunch with team1:00 p.m. to 2:00 p.m.: More meetings2:00 p.m. to 4:00 p.m.: Deep work5:00 p.m. to 7:00 p.m.: More meetings (sometimes with people in Asia)7:00 p.m. to 8:30 p.m.: Finish up last tasks and work8:30 p.m.: Leave officeOn weekends, Lim says he locks away his work phone in a cupboard and focuses on spending time with family.Going deep on personal passionsAlong with saving weekends for family time, Lim also prioritizes his passion for sports and exercise by building it into his daily schedule.\"One advice [I have] for founders and leaders is ... to go very deep on one passion you have that is not work [related],\" said Lim. \"For me, that has been sports ... I do a lot of basketball, swimming, and gym. I think having a balance other than work has been very helpful for me.\"CEO of Workstream Desmond Lim has been playing basketball since he was seven-years-old.Courtesy of Desmond Lim.Lim developed his love for basketball when he was seven. He went on to captain his school teams from middle school to university, and even played professionally for the Singapore National Youth Team.These days, he still starts each morning with 75 to 90 minutes of exercise —calisthenics, gym training or basketball — often with a friend to keep him accountable.\"I really believe in being able to move well ...

    "body": "Photo illustration of the YouTube TV logo displayed on a smartphone, with the YouTube logo in the background.Nurphoto | Nurphoto | Getty ImagesDisney content, including channels like ABC and ESPN, was removed from Google's YouTube TV overnight after the two companies failed to renew a streaming contract. \"Despite our best efforts, we have not been able to reach a fair deal, and starting today, Disney programming will not be available on YouTube TV,\" the platform said in a statement.More than 20 channels would be removed from YouTube TV, the company said, adding if the content is unavailable for an extended period of time, the company would offer users a $20 credit. Affected networks include ESPN and its sister sports networks, ABC, FX, NatGeo, Disney Channel and Freeform. Disney said in a statement, \"Google's YouTube TV has chosen to deny their subscribers the content they value most by refusing to pay fair rates for our channels, including ESPN and ABC.\"Disney Entertainment Co-Chairs Dana Walden and Alan Bergman and ESPN Chairman Jimmy Pitaro sent a memo to all Disney employees Friday, noting that YouTube TV also \"deleted all [Disney] previously recorded shows and events from their subscribers' libraries\" in addition to failing to strike a deal.\"Their actions make clear how little regard they have for their customers and are consistent with an attitude which has been prevalent throughout our negotiations — YouTube TV and its owner, Google, are not interested in achieving a fair deal with us,\" wrote Walden, Bergman and Pitaro. \"Instead, they want to use their power and extraordinary resources to eliminate competition and devalue the very content that helped them build their service.\"The two sides had been engaged in negotiations but were unable to reach a new distribution agreement before their existing contract expired Oct. 30 at 11:59 p.m. ET. YouTube TV subscribers risk losing access to college football if a deal isn't struck by Saturday morning and \"Monday Night Football\" if programming isn't returned by the start of next week.Disney warned last week it could result in a content blackout.In a Thursday statement on its official blog, YouTube argued Disney had \"used the threat of a blackout on YouTube TV as a negotiating tactic to force deal terms that would raise prices on our customers,\" and that Disney was now following through on that threat.\"We will not agree to terms that disadvantage our members while benefiting Disney's own live TV products,\" YouTube TV said in a post on its help center webpage. Disney's live TV offerings include Hulu + Live TV and Fubo.\"We know how disruptive it is to lose channels you enjoy, and we're committed to continuing to work with Disney to reach an agreement,\" YouTube said in its statement.YouTube TV pays broadcasters to stream their channels and has been engaged in several tense negotiations over contract renewals in recent months.Last month, NBCUniversal content was nearly removed from YouTube TV before the companies reached an agreement after a temporary extension, preventing shows like \"Sunday Night Football\" and \"America's Got Talent\" from being pulled.CNBC reported last week that Disney was willing to offer YouTube TV a distribution agreement that would give some subscribers access to Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+ for no extra charge. Disney has previously offered similar terms to Charter, the largest U.S. pay TV provider by subscribers.However, YouTube asked for Disney's streaming content to be ingested into YouTube TV, giving customers the ability to view programming on Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+ without leaving the platform, according to a source familiar with the negotiations.Disney had rejected that proposal and had no plans to budge on the request, people familiar with the company's thinking told CNBC. Disney has no interest in adding its streaming services to YouTube Primetime Channels, the people said.The recent clash between Disney and YouTube has an added twist, after YouTube hired former Disney distribution executive Justin Connolly earlier this year, prompting Disney to file a breach-of-contract lawsuit.Connolly has recused himself from the discussions, CNBC previously reported, according to the people familiar with the process. Disney and YouTube reportedly settled the lawsuit.YouTube is the top U.S. media distributor by audience engagement, capturing over 13% of TV watch-time in July, according to Nielsen. It is also on track to be the biggest media company by revenue in 2025, beating Disney, analysts at MoffettNathanson told CNBC.— CNBC's Alex Sherman contributed to this report.Disclosure: Comcast is the parent company of NBCUniversal, which owns CNBC. Versant would become the new parent company of CNBC upon Comcast's planned spinoff of Versant.Clarification: This article has been updated to clarify that NBCUniversal content was nearly removed from YouTube TV last month before those companies reached an agreement.",

    "body": "I grew up in Nara, Japan, surrounded by fruit trees, farms, and generous neighbors who would bring us baskets of freshly picked strawberries, watermelons, persimmons, figs, and pretty much anything that was ripe on their farm.Fruit was part of the seasons, traditions, celebrations, and even medicine. As a nutritionist, I still believe that fruit is one of the most powerful tools we have for supporting health and longevity. Plus, it tastes incredible.While I'm obsessed with all fruit, here are the five I always keep in my kitchen for a long and healthy life.1. ApplesOne of my favorite activities every year is apple picking at Fishkill Farms in upstate New York.Michiko TomiokaThere are over 90 varieties of apples grown in the U.S., but most people stick to a few like Fuji, Gala, Honeycrisp, or Granny Smith. When you try different types, you'll get a wider variety of nutrients and flavors.How I enjoy them: I eat them with the skin for maximum fiber. I also love adding apple slices to salads, baking them into dishes, including soups, or making homemade applesauce.2. Citrus fruitsFrom clementines and navel oranges to yuzu, lemons, and limes, citrus fruits are rich in vitamins C, A, and folate, as well as potassium and fiber.They're also high in flavonoids and carotenoids — antioxidants that protect your cells and support your immune system. Vitamin C also boosts iron absorption from plant-based foods, especially important in vegetarian or vegan diets.How I enjoy them: Eat the whole fruit, not just the juice. Orange juice lacks fiber and can spike blood sugar. I use the zest and juice for salad dressings, baking, tea, and jams. I often add sliced citrus to salads for a burst of flavor and color.Most people discard the peel, but it actually contains lots of folate, riboflavin, thiamine, and calcium.3. BerriesWhether it's strawberries, blueberries, blackberries, raspberries, cranberries, or goji berries, berries are low in calories but packed with vitamins, fiber, and powerful antioxidants like anthocyanins.Blueberries in particular are famous for brain and heart health, while goji berries are rich in beta-carotene and support eye health.I love using berries and oranges for homemade jam. So delicious and easy!Michiko TomiokaHow I enjoy them: I eat them fresh when in season. Frozen organic berries are great for smoothies, and dried goji berries make delicious snacks or toppings.4. PersimmonsPersimmons are rich in vitamins A and C, fiber (both soluble and insoluble), potassium, and polyphenols like tannins and flavonoids. Research has shown that they support cholesterol and blood pressure control, and promote eye and skin health.There are two main types:Fuyu (non-astringent): eaten when firmHachiya (astringent): must be fully ripe or driedHow I enjoy them: My mother would hang astringent persimmons to dry in late fall. We'd eat them as snacks, use them in Japanese sweets (\"wagashi\"), or simmer with vegetables. I also love drinking persimmon leaf tea, which has anti-inflammatory properties and a rich, earthy flavor.5. FigsIn Japanese, fig is called \"ichijiku,\" which means \"no flower fruit.\" That's because the flower blooms inside the fruit!Figs are rich in fiber, vitamins, minerals, and phytoestrogens, which support women's health. They also contain ficin, an enzyme that helps digest proteins — making figs a perfect after-meal snack. Other health benefits include cholesterol control and inflammation reduction.How I enjoy them: I use both fresh and dried figs in salads, soups, desserts, and jams. Their sweetness pairs beautifully with matcha or dark chocolate.My advice for a fruitful life1. Embrace seasonal variety. Different fruits offer different nutrients. Try to eat locally grown, seasonal produce whenever possible. It's fresher, tastier, and better for the planet.2. Eat whole, organic when possible. Whole fruits contain skin, pulp, and fiber — all vital for slowing down sugar absorption and supporting digestion. Choose organic when you can, especially for fruits you eat with the skin.3. Eat mindfully. Slow down and savor your fruit. I chew each slice of apple at least 20 times. This helps with digestion and satisfaction.4. Set an example. Encourage children to love fruit not because it's \"healthy,\" but because it's delicious. Make it a joyful, regular part of meals.5. Don't fear the natural sugar in fruits. Unlike refined sugar, whole fruits come packaged with fiber, vitamins, and antioxidants.Michiko Tomioka, MBA, RDN is a certified nutritionist and longevity expert. Born and raised Nara, Japan, her approach focuses on a plant-based diet.

    "body": "White House Lincoln Bathroom Renovation.Source: @realdonaldtrump | Truth SocialFirst it was the Oval Office,  then the East Wing — now it's the Lincoln Bedroom's bathroom.President Donald Trump on Friday proudly showed off the latest project in his inside-and-out remodel of the White House — as critics slammed him as \"tone deaf\" for touting glitzy renovations during the costly government shutdown.Trump shared two dozen photos of the newly refurbished bathroom, which is now covered from floor to ceiling with what he described as \"black and white polished Statuary marble.\"Renovated Lincoln Bathroom in the White House.Source: @realdonaldtrump | Truth Social\"This was very appropriate for the time of Abraham Lincoln and, in fact, could be the marble that was originally there!\" Trump wrote in one of seven Truth Social posts containing photos of the renovation.The bathroom also sports gold-colored fixtures and accents — including the bath and sink faucets, wall sconces and trash bin — as well as a crystal hanging chandelier, the photos show.Trump told NBC News in July that he planned to update the bathroom of the historic Lincoln Bedroom in a style that is truer to the era of the 16th president, who held office from 1861 until his assassination in 1865.The previous decor, an art deco green tile style, was \"totally inappropriate for the Lincoln Era,\" Trump wrote in Friday's post.The Lincoln Bathroom in the White House before renovation.Source: @realdonaldtrump | Truth SocialTrump's Democratic critics pounced on the construction updates, slamming him for focusing on the bathroom remodel while a government shutdown, now in its 31st day, threatens access to crucial federal services.\"Donald Trump actually cares more about his toilet than he does about fixing your healthcare,\" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., wrote in an X post.\"Millions of people are being kicked off of food assistance and millions can't afford health care anymore. But don't worry everyone! Trump got a new bathroom,\" Democratic commentator Harry Sisson wrote on X.\"So tone deaf, out of touch, and disgusting,\" Sisson added.\"We are in a serious govt shutdown, but instead of negotiating, Trump posted several pics of his WH bathroom remodel today and now this,\" wrote Ron Filipowski, editor in chief of the anti-Trump media outlet MeidasTouch.Asked for a response to those critiques, White House spokesman Davis Ingle told CNBC, \"Democrats are more concerned with President Trump's historic beautification of the White House than they are for American citizens they are hurting because of their reckless government shutdown.\"In another Truth Social post Friday, Trump announced that he had inspected construction taking place at the Kennedy Center, where, months earlier, he had fired several board members and installed himself as chair.\"It is really looking good!\" he wrote. \"The exterior columns, which were in serious danger of corrosion if something weren't done, are completed, and look magnificent in White Enamel — Like a different place!\"\"Marble is being done, stages are being renovated, new seats, new chairs, and new fabrics will soon be installed, and magnificent high end carpeting throughout the building,\" Trump wrote.The update came hours after The Washington Post reported that ticket sales at the Kennedy Center have plummeted in recent months.Read more CNBC politics coverageShutdown cost government contractors $12B so far: U.S. Chamber of CommerceThe big takeaways from the Trump-Xi meeting — what the truce coversShipping sector skeptical Trump's latest trade truce with China will reverse import declineTrump-Xi meeting nears with high stakes and hopes, but few detailsGovernment shutdown could cost U.S. economy up to $14 billion, CBO says",

    "body": "Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella speaks during an event commemorating the 50th anniversary of the company at Microsoft headquarters in Redmond, Washington, on April 4, 2025. Microsoft Corp., determined to hold its ground in artificial intelligence, will soon let consumers tailor the Copilot digital assistant to their own needs.David Ryder | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesMicrosoft will expand its employee base once again, CEO Satya Nadella told investor Brad Gerstner on a podcast that aired on Friday.The software maker's workforce didn't budge in the 2025 fiscal year, which ended in June. It stood at 228,000, with multiple rounds of layoffs lowering the total number by at least 6,000. In July, Microsoft let go of another 9,000 workers.\"I will say we will grow our headcount, but the way I look at it is, that headcount we grow will grow with a lot more leverage than the headcount we had pre-AI,\" Nadella said on the BG2 podcast. OpenAI, which has a broad partnership with Microsoft, introduced its ChatGPT assistant in 2022. Microsoft's headcount grew by 22% in the 2022 fiscal year.Employees will figure out how to do their jobs differently, Nadella said, adding that the company wants to ensure they can access artificial intelligence features in Microsoft 365 productivity software and the GitHub Copilot AI coding assistant. Those services draw on AI models from Anthropic and OpenAI.\"It's the unlearning and learning process that I think will take the next year or so, then the headcount growth will come with max leverage,\" he said.A similar adjustment played out at corporations decades ago, Nadella said. To prepare forecasts, inter-office memos would circulate across multiple sites by fax, and then came email and Excel spreadsheets, he said.\"Right now, any planning, any execution, starts with AI. You research with AI, you think with AI, you share with your colleagues and what have you,\" Nadella said.This week, Amazon, which is racing against Microsoft to rent out cloud infrastructure for running AI models, cut 14,000 corporate employees.Amazon's senior vice president of people experience and technology, Beth Galetti, told workers in a memo that \"this generation of AI is the most transformative technology we've seen since the Internet, and it's enabling companies to innovate much faster than ever before (in existing market segments and altogether new ones).\"On the podcast, Nadella talked about a Microsoft executive who deals with networking fiber. As the company ramped up data center operations to meet rising cloud demand, the executive realized she wouldn't be able to hire all the people she thought she needed, and so she built AI agents to handle maintenance, Nadella said.\"That is an example of you, to your point, a team with AI tools being able to get more productivity,\" Nadella told Gerstner, who is founder and CEO of technology investment firm Altimeter Capital.On Wednesday, Microsoft reported 12% year-over-year revenue growth and showed the widest operating margin since 2002.WATCH: Microsoft earnings beat estimates, Azure revenue jumps 40%watch now",

Kent Nishimura | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesKorean semiconductor giant Samsung said Thursday that it plans to buy and deploy a cluster of 50,000 Nvidia graphics processing units to improve its chip manufacturing for mobile devices and robots.The 50,000 Nvidia GPUs will be used to create a facility Samsung is calling an \"AI Megafactory.\" Samsung didn't provide details about when the facility would be built.It's the latest splashy partnership for Nvidia, whose chips remain essential for building and deploying advanced artificial intelligence.The agreement with Samsung comes after Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang on Tuesday announced in Washington, D.C., that Nvidia was collaborating with companies including Palantir, Eli Lilly, CrowdStrike and Uber.Shortly after the speech, Huang was spotted in South Korea drinking beer with Samsung Chairman Lee Jae-yong and other business leaders, according to local media. Other Korean companies, including SK Group and Hyundai, are also deploying similar amounts of GPUs, Nvidia said.\"We're working closely with the Korean government to support its ambitious leadership plans in AI,\" Raymond Teh, Nvidia's senior vice president of Asia-Pacific, said on a call Wednesday with reporters.The partnerships support Huang's claim on Tuesday that Nvidia has a book of business that totals $500 billion from its current generation GPU, called Blackwell, in addition to its next-generation GPU, called Rubin.The forecast helped boost Nvidia's stock, making the company the first to reach a market cap of $5 trillion.On Thursday, Nvidia representatives said they will work with Samsung to adapt the Korean company's chipmaking lithography platform to work with Nvidia's GPUs. That process will results in 20 times better performance for Samsung, the Nvidia representatives said. Samsung will also use Nvidia's simulation software called Omniverse. Known for its mobile phones, Samsung also said it would use the Nvidia chips to run its own AI models for its devices.In addition to being a partner and customer, Samsung is also a key supplier for Nvidia.Samsung makes the kind of high-performance memory Nvidia uses in large quantities, alongside its AI chips, called high bandwidth memory. Samsung said it will work with Nvidia to tweak its HBM4 memory for use in AI chips.WATCH: Night out in Seoul: Nvidia, Samsung, and Hyundai bosses bond over fried chicken and sojuwatch now",

    "body": "US President Donald Trump (R) speaks during a meeting with Australia's Prime Minister Anthony Albanese in the Cabinet Room at the White House in Washington, DC, on Oct. 20, 2025. Saul Loeb | AFP | Getty ImagesA federal judge in Rhode Island on Friday blocked the Trump administration from ceasing to pay SNAP benefits that help feed 42 million Americans during the U.S. government shutdown.The oral ruling by Judge Jack McConnell, which directed that those food stamp benefits be paid out of emergency funds \"as soon as possible,\" came a day before the administration was set to cut off the aid.\"There is no doubt, and it is beyond argument, that irreparable harm will begin to occur if it hasn't already occurred in the terror it has caused some people about the availability of funding for food for their family,\" McConnell said.McConnell's ruling came minutes after another federal judge in Boston, who is overseeing a separate but similar lawsuit, said that the group of states that are plaintiffs in that case is likely to prove that the suspension of Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits was \"unlawful.\"That judge, Indira Talwani, gave the administration until Monday to tell her if it will authorize at least reduced SNAP benefits for November.President Donald Trump, in a statement on social media later Friday, said, \"Our Government lawyers do not think we have the legal authority to pay SNAP with certain monies we have available, and now two Courts have issued conflicting opinions on what we can and cannot do.\"\"I do NOT want Americans to go hungry just because the Radical Democrats refuse to do the right thing and REOPEN THE GOVERNMENT,\" Trump wrote on Truth Social. \"Therefore, I have instructed our lawyers to ask the Court to clarify how we can legally fund SNAP as soon as possible.\"\"If we are given the appropriate legal direction by the Court, it will BE MY HONOR to provide the funding, just like I did with Military and Law Enforcement Pay,\" he said.Lawyers for the plaintiffs in the case before McConnell argued at a court hearing Friday that the cutoff of SNAP benefits was an \"arbitrary and capricious act\" that had caused \"a crisis\" for the Americans who need food stamps to eat.A Justice Department lawyer argued that SNAP did not exist anymore because there were no congressionally appropriated funds for it as a result of the shutdown.The lawyer, Tyler Becker, also argued it was the administration's discretion whether to use up to $6 billion in contingency funds already set aside by Congress to continue issuing SNAP benefits.\"There is no SNAP program and, as a result, the government cannot just provide SNAP benefits,\" Becker said.\"A shutdown is not an emergency,\" said Becker, adding that if there was an emergency, it had been created by Congress in failing to appropriate money to keep the government operating.But McConnell told the administration to use the available contingency funds to maintain at least some of the SNAP benefits that are normally paid.The judge also said the administration needed to examine whether other federal funds would be available to keep the program operating in the absence of a funding bill by Congress.McConnell's ruling granted a temporary restraining order to plaintiffs who filed a lawsuit on Thursday in U.S. District Court in Providence against the Trump administration to maintain the benefits.White House National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett, during an interview Friday afternoon with NBC News' \"Meet the Press Now,\" would not say whether the Trump administration would comply with either court ruling. Read more CNBC government shutdown coverage Government shutdown could cost U.S. economy up to $14 billion, CBO

reaffirms a fundamental principle: no administration can use hunger as a political weapon,\" the coalition said. \"This victory is about more than one program — it's about the American values of fairness, compassion, and accountability that hold our democracy together.\"The plaintiffs include a group of cities, charitable and faith-based non-profit groups, unions and business organizations.The Boston judge, Talwani, in her separate order on Friday, said she was still considering the plaintiffs' request for a temporary restraining order to maintain the benefits.But she also ordered the administration to tell her by Monday if it would \"authorize at least reduced SNAP benefits for November, and, if so, their timeline for determining whether to authorize only reduced SNAP benefits using the Contingency Funds or to authorize full SNAP benefits using both the Contingency Funds and additional available funds.\"Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., praised both rulings.\"Good,\" Schumer wrote in a post on the social media site X.\"Trump's decision to cut off SNAP was vindictive and heartless,\" Schumer wrote.\"He was trying to manufacture a hunger crisis so he wouldn't have to fix healthcare. No president in American history has cut off SNAP during a shutdown, including Trump during his own first term.\"Hassett, the National Economic Council director, blasted the rulings.\"We're about to use emergency funds from the Department of Agriculture because of a liberal judge ruling that we disagree at the law on,\" Hassett said in an interview on Fox News.\"But then we don't have our emergency funds in case we have a hurricane or we have an emergency -- a food emergency,\" Hassett said. \"And so we've got to get the government open. We've got to do it as soon as possible. And the Democrats really don't have a plan.\"The Trump administration blames Senate Democrats for the shutdown, given their refusal to vote for a short-term funding bill proposed by House Republicans, which does not include an extension of enhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies that Democrats insist on.",

    "body": "Oils containing CBD (Cannabidiol).Geoffroy Van Der Hasselt | AFP | Getty ImagesCannabis stocks could be poised for a rally after years of stagnation, fueled by investor optimism over the possibility for new federal rules for hemp-derived products and signals that President Donald Trump could take a more permissive stance on marijuana.Publicly traded cannabis companies have seen their share of ups and downs. Verano Holdings reported earnings Wednesday that saw revenues of $203 million, up slightly from the previous quarter but down 6% year-over-year. However, Verano posted a net loss of $44 million, partly due to a $5 million impairment charge on a facility in Pennsylvania and $10 million in legal contingencies as a result of a settlement.Next week, two U.S. cannabis giants, Curaleaf and Trulieve, are set to follow in reporting earnings. While the sector is down roughly 10% this year, based on cannabis-focused ETFs, some executives, like the CEO of Tilray Brands, remain optimistic for a turnaround. Already, in October, Tilray Brands' stock jolted up 22% after reporting better-than-expected fiscal first-quarter results.\"We could be looking at a true inflection point for cannabis. If reforms move forward, it could attract more companies to do business in the U.S.,\" Tilray CEO Irwin Simon told CNBC.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconCannabis company stocks Tilray Brands, Curaleaf and TrulieveThree developments are driving the growth: Trump's seeming embrace of Medicare coverage for CBD, a non-intoxicating hemp-derived cannabis compound; the president's statements about reclassifying the drug status of marijuana; and movement in Congress to regulate hemp.Meanwhile, cannabis is becoming more popular than ever. As of a 2024 report, daily or near-daily marijuana use surpassed daily drinking in the U.S., based on analysis of 40 years of data from Carnegie Mellon University.The annual value of the U.S. production of cannabis grew 40% last year from the previous year, according to the Department of Agriculture, and cannabis-derived products, which include CBD and marijuana-based items, are now projected to reach a $160 billion global market by 2032, according to Grand View Research.The 'Trump effect'Optimism in the cannabis market surged in September after Trump shared a video on Truth Social that promoted Medicare coverage of CBD and made unproven anti-aging claims about the substance. The video was produced by The Commonwealth Project — which advocates for seniors using cannabis and was founded and is funded by Palm Beach billionaire Howard Kessler — and directly appealed to the president.Known for pioneering affinity credit cards, Kessler shifted to cannabis advocacy in 2019 but has been in Trump's orbit since at least 2005, attending Trump's wedding to Melania Trump and appearing at Mar-a-Lago and state dinners. Neither Kessler nor the White House responded to a request for comment on the matter.Cannabis stocks reacted immediately to the video. On the day it was posted, shares of Tilray spiked 42%, while Aurora Cannabis stock gained 25%, shares of Canopy Growth jumped 18% and Cronos Group stock added 15.5%.\"A lot of folks in the industry saw him [Trump] posting the video as a bit of a surprise but we think he's trying to gauge how the public feels about cannabis products,\" said Adam Smith, executive director of the Marijuana Policy Project, which advocates for the legalization of marijuana. \"Some people call it the 'Trump effect,' and think if he leans into CBD, it's possible that other Republicans will support.\"There is limited data on effective doses of CBD for inflammation or chronic pain, particularly in seniors, according to the National Institutes of Health. Kevin Sabet, president of Smart Approaches to Marijuana, an organization opposed to marijuana, said people are overreacting to the post.\"It's a big stretch to say a post or two is a fully throated endorsement of reform,\" Sabet told CNBC. \"A lot of times his posts don't line up with formal policy positions.\"To date, the FDA has only approved one CBD-based drug, Epidiolex, to treat rare forms of epilepsy. Other uses lack scientific evidence and have \"largely unknown\" effects, said Meg Haney, director of the Cannabis Research Laboratory at Columbia University.Emoji gummies by JustCBD are displayed at the Cannabis World Congress & Business Exposition trade show, Thursday, May 30, 2019 in New York. The treats contain non-psychoactive cannabidiol, CBD.Jeremy Rehm | APThe Farm BillTrump's post also adds to momentum around regulating hemp — which is a variant of the marijuana plant that doesn't cause a \"high, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention — which was legalized under the 2018 Farm Bill. Congress is weighing updates to the bill by year's-end that could adopt long-awaited federal standards for labeling, testing and safety of hemp-derived products left unregulated under the original law.\"Regulation isn't scary, as long as it is effective, because the clearer the lines are, the better it is to be in the business [when] you don't have a looming axe over your head,\" said Pamela Epstein, the chief legal and regulatory officer of hemp producer Terpene Belt Farms. The 2018 legalization triggered a $1.6 billion hemp market by 2023, according to Grand View Research. Hemp-derived CBD products containing less than 0.3% THC — the psychoactive compound responsible for a high — were legalized under the bill and spread rapidly into gummies, beverages, creams and even pet treats, and are projected to drive more than 20% growth by 2030, the data firm said.But the vacuum of oversight left consumers exposed to mislabeled, untested and sometimes unsafe products, Smith told CNBC.\"It's possible in the hemp sector grew a little too fast without rules,\" Smith said. \"Problems came up with some stuff masquerading as CBD but having high levels of THC, products marketed to kids and some products with tainted samples.\"Proposals in Congress range from an outright ban on hemp to tightening THC limits. Others in the cannabis industry are lobbying for an \"alcohol-model\" framework — with the FDA overseeing product safety and the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau managing taxation and distribution.\"Clear rules aren't scary,\" said Tilray CEO Simon. \"They're the best way to grow sustainably and shed the uncertainty that's defined this space for years.\"People like Epstein caution that a complete ban could cripple the hemp economy, which supports about 320,000 jobs nationwide, according to the U.S. Hemp Roundtable and industry-related reports. But others like Michael Mayes, CEO of cannabis consulting firm Quantum 9, said any form of federal standards is essential to legitimize the market and draw institutional investors.\"Federal regulations would help some investors see cannabis as not a fringe investment with their money,\" Mayes told CNBC. \"By next year, it's possible. Smart, consistent rules could be the key to unlocking billions in growth while working to ensure consumer safety.\"Marijuana reschedulingTrump's apparent openness to CBD has fueled speculation he may go further.In August, he said his administration was \"looking at\" reclassifying marijuana from a Schedule I drug — alongside heroin and LSD — to a Schedule III drug.The move would not legalize recreational marijuana but it would make it easier to sell, advocates said. It would also improve access to banking and financial services because it would lift certain IRS tax restrictions, which bar cannabis businesses from deducting standard expenses. Changes could also ease barriers to conducting scientific research, which experts said has been stifled under the drug's current classification.\"To demonstrate that cannabis has medical utility, we need to do large, controlled trials, but we can't really do those if it's a Schedule I drug. As a result, that means you can't do the studies needed to reschedule it,\" Haney said. \"It's like the chicken and egg conundrum.\"A White House official described the rescheduling process as ongoing and said that \"all policy and legal requirements and implications are being considered.\"Cannabis industry sources said investor optimism partly centers on Trump's chief of staff, Susie Wiles, who previously worked at Ballard Partners, a Florida lobbying firm representing Trulieve, one of the largest U.S. cannabis companies. Though Wiles wasn't registered as Trulieve's lobbyist, she is described by multiple sources in the cannabis industry as a close friend of Trulieve CEO Kim Rivers. The people spoke anonymously to talk candidly about the matter.According to the Florida Division of Elections, Trulieve spent more than $100 million supporting a failed ballot measure to legalize recreational cannabis for adults 21 and older. The company reportedly played a key role in securing Trump's backing for the initiative. For the presidential race, according to Federal Election Commission filings, Trulieve donated $750,000 to Trump's inauguration committee and another $250,000 to his MAGA Inc. super PAC.Rivers attended two pre-inauguration events, including a dinner for Vice President JD Vance, and reportedly joined a $1 million-a-plate fundraiser at Trump's New Jersey golf club in August, where she urged him to reclassify marijuana, the Wall Street Journal reported.Two days after the fundraiser, Trump made his \"looking at\" comments about marijuana's classification.Wiles, Rivers and Truileve did not respond to requests for comment.A man prepares a  marijuana cigarette at Washington Square Park on April 20, 2023 in New York City. Leonardo Munoz | Corbis News | Getty ImagesRepublican roadblocksDespite optimism from investors and advocates, many Republican lawmakers are moving to rein in hemp-derived products, citing safety concerns.The backlash stems from hemp's post-2018 boom, which quickly turned into a glut. Licensed acreage soared 445% over the previous year by 2019, according to advocacy and research group Vote Hemp, but the market became oversaturated with products, which forced many retailers and producers to pivot or close, experts said.\"Very quickly, there became a bloat of products and for a lot of the companies, the financial results weren't there. There wasn't growth. You had some really tough balance sheets, and I think the investors were unsure of the underlying fundamentals,\" Cronos Group CEO Michael Gorenstein said.Today, the market has rebounded but remains the \"Wild West\" without regulations, Smith said. FDA research this summer linked unregulated CBD to potential liver damage, and experts warn that THC in hemp can be chemically altered or added in quantities that make it as intoxicating as marijuana.Lawmakers have responded to safety concerns.Over the summer, Rep. Andy Harris, R-Md., introduced a bill redefining hemp to exclude any product with \"quantifiable\" THC, which passed a House committee along party lines. The Senate Appropriations Committee advanced similar language unanimously in July, as Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., — who championed the 2018 legalization effort — called for restoring the law's \"original intent.\" A Congressional Research Service report in August said the proposals would \"effectively\" ban almost all hemp-derived products.Looking ahead, many in the industry said the future rests on what Trump does next, particularly in the next few months. Even the perception of regulatory change has spurred investor optimism.\"For many of us, it's not a question of when but what the regulations will be and how they'll be enforced,\" Gorenstein said. \"If the next administration delivers clarity, that alone could shake up this industry.\"",

    "body": "The U.S. Capitol building, weeks into the continuing U.S. government shutdown, in Washington on Oct. 27, 2025. Kylie Cooper | ReutersOpen enrollment for health insurance bought on the Affordable Care Act marketplace starts Nov. 1 in most states — but millions of people may get a financial surprise when they try to sign up.That's because a congressional deadlock tied to the extension of enhanced subsidies for insurance premiums has continued with no end in sight.Consumers are \"going to get huge sticker shock, because prices are going up,\" said Carolyn McClanahan, a physician and certified financial planner based in Jacksonville, Florida.That sticker shock could have significant ramifications for consumers' finances and the choices they make about health coverage, experts say, contributing to a higher population of uninsured and underinsured consumers and soaring premiums in years to come.While the percentage of Americans who have ACA marketplace health insurance is small, the share could be large enough to swing a close election, KFF reported in October.ACA subsidies at the heart of the government shutdownDuring open enrollment, consumers pick their health plans for the coming year.While open enrollment generally lasts through Jan. 15, there's a Dec. 15 deadline to ensure coverage starts at the beginning of 2026.However, prospective enrollees are in financial limbo.Congress has yet to extend the enhanced subsidies that make insurance premiums cheaper for about 22 million of the 24 million Americans who buy insurance over the ACA exchanges.Recipients' health premiums are set to increase by 114% in 2026, on average, without the enhanced subsidies, according to KFF, a nonpartisan health policy research group.Certain enrollees, such as early retirees with modest incomes, face much larger increases, health experts said.Read more CNBC personal finance coverageLayoffs are mounting, making it a 'challenging time to be unemployed': expertWhy travel insurance may not protect you in the government shutdownStudent loan class action effort: Trump official, credit agencies hurt borrowers' scoresTreasury Department: Series I bond rate of 4.03% through April 2026Taxpayers may see 'record tax refund season' in 2026, analysts sayMillions face 'huge sticker shock' when ACA open enrollment starts Nov. 1Here's the maximum 2026 Social Security full retirement benefit, after 2.8% COLAStudent loan forgiveness for public servants to be limited under TrumpDemocrats propose increasing VA, Social Security benefits by $200 a monthAdjustable-rate mortgages are 'underappreciated,' top advisor saysHow the 2026 Social Security payroll tax cap could impact your paycheckWhat this Fed rate cut means for your credit card, mortgage and savings accountHow the Fed's decision to lower rates could widen the generational wealth gapThis investing move is the 'holy grail of retirement planning,' advisor saysWhat another Fed cut could mean for borrowers — some rates may barely budgeCNBC's Financial Advisor 100: Best financial advisors, top firms for 2025 rankedThe enhanced subsidies are at the heart of the federal government shutdown that started Oct. 1. The shutdown is already the second-longest in U.S. history, behind a 35-day shutdown during President Donald Trump's first term.The enhanced subsidies, also known as enhanced premium tax credits, have been available since the Biden administration passed them in 2021 and extended them in 2022. They are scheduled to expire at the end of 2025.Democrats are pushing to extend the subsidies as part of a deal to end the shutdown. Republicans have said they want to negotiate the subsidies separately.More than half, 57%, of ACA marketplace enrollees live in Republican congressional districts, according to a KFF analysis from earlier this month. This year, about 80% of all premium tax credits, or $115 billion, went to ACA marketplace enrollees in states won by President Trump in last year's election, KFF found.There are 39 congressional districts where at least 10% of the population is enrolled in the ACA marketplaces and where, had it not been for enhanced subsidies, their 2024 average premium payments would have been double or more, according to KFF.These districts are largely concentrated in Trump-won states: The bulk, 20, are in Texas, with another seven in Florida and three in Georgia.What this means for open enrollmentAbsent a deal, many people who try to enroll in a health plan via the Affordable Care Act marketplace will see significantly higher premiums during open enrollment, said Cynthia Cox, vice president and director of the ACA program at KFF.The financial stakes vary according to factors such as household income, age and state.For example, the average 60-year-old couple making $85,000 would see their annual premiums increase more than $22,600 in 2026, according to KFF.A 45-year-old earning $20,000 in a state that didn't expand Medicaid would see premiums rise from $0 to $420 per year, on average, it found.Maskot | Getty ImagesThere are many potential implications to the congressional impasse and consumers' sticker shock during open enrollment, Cox said.Many people may opt not to sign up for coverage rather than pay higher premiums, and therefore would be uninsured, Cox said.Others, such as self-employed entrepreneurs and gig workers, may choose to try to find a more traditional job that offers employer-based health insurance so they don't have to sign up for a marketplace plan, Cox said.Some people may opt to buy lower-tier plans that come with smaller upfront premiums but much higher deductibles on the back end, meaning they'd be on the hook for a hefty bill if they need to use their insurance, Cox said.If young, healthy people don't enroll, insurers would be left with a relatively older, less healthy population of enrollees — likely leading insurers to raise their annual premiums even more in the future due to the pool of higher-risk enrollees, she said.The damage may be done, even if Congress does eventually extend the enhanced subsidies, experts said.\"There's certainly a very real possibility that people will log on Nov. 1 and say, 'Gosh, I can't afford that premium,' and they don't come back to look again even if there were a subsequent enactment of enhanced subsidies,\" said Jonathan Burks, executive vice president of health and economic policy at the Bipartisan Policy Center.What prospective ACA enrollees should doAs things stand, enhanced subsidies will expire.Prospective enrollees in an ACA marketplace plan should pick their 2026 health insurance coverage with this in mind, Cox said. In other words, don't pick a plan based on the expectation that Congress will extend the enhanced subsidies, she said.However, she recommends enrollees pay close attention to the news. If Congress reaches a deal, enrollees should come back and look again, because their options and costs may have changed, Cox said.\"If it were me, I'd probably make a note on my calendar to shop over Thanksgiving or in early December,\" with an eye to the Dec. 15 deadline, Cox said.There's certainly a very real possibility that people will log on Nov. 1 and say, 'Gosh, I can't afford that premium.'Jonathan Burksexecutive vice president of health and economic policy at the Bipartisan Policy CenterLuckily, the open enrollment period offers relative flexibility, Burks said.Consumers can pick a plan and select another plan later within the open enrollment period without consequence, he said.\"People shouldn't feel the need to rush into a decision, nor is there a real cost if they make a decision early on, [then] circumstances change and they want to evaluate that decision before the end of the open enrollment period,\" Burks said.Current enrollees who take no action will be reenrolled into the same plan or a similar one if the current plan is no longer available, experts said.How to think through health insurance decisionsEven consumers who are healthy and rarely go to a doctor should have insurance, even a plan with a high deductible, in case there's a major unforeseen health event, said McClanahan, the founder of Life Planning Partners and a member of CNBC's Financial Advisor Council.Those with minor health issues such as hypertension or diabetes and who see a doctor regularly can consider buying a high-deductible plan — which generally carry lower upfront premiums — on the ACA marketplace, she said.Pair that coverage with a direct primary care physician model. Such doctors charge a subscription for care — maybe $150 or $200 a month — and provide all basic primary care such as basic laboratory tests and imaging services, she said.Those with serious illnesses who go to the doctor frequently would be best suited by buying a good health insurance plan with a broad network of doctors and, ideally, a lower deductible, McClanahan said.Of course, this may be challenging for households that lose enhanced subsidies, she said.",

    "body": "Evolve Bank CEO Bob Hartheimer booking photo.Source: Shelby County JailBob Hartheimer, CEO of Tennessee's Evolve Bank & Trust, was fired after U.S. law enforcement officials caught him propositioning a law enforcement officer posing as a 15-year-old boy on gay dating app Grindr.On Oct. 19, an employee of the Federal Bureau of Investigation logged onto Grindr while pretending to be a teen boy, and a user called \"Tomm\" wrote a message to that person saying, \"Hey any chance u would hu with an older and chill guy,\" according to an affidavit from a special agent with the Federal Bureau of Investigation that was unsealed on Tuesday.The two discussed getting together in person later in the week, according to the affidavit. On Snapchat, they talked about the sex acts they might perform. \"Tomm\" asked for a photo of the \"boy\" without shorts on, and he also sent the undercover agent a picture of himself naked. The FBI was able to obtain an IP address for \"Tomm\" from Snapchat, as well as an address from Comcast, the affidavit showed.Hartheimer was arrested in Memphis on Oct. 23 for attempted production of child pornography and transfer of obscene material to a minor, according to a warrant.An Evolve spokesperson and Blake Ballin, a lawyer representing Hartheimer, told CNBC on Saturday that Evolve has fired the CEO.\"Bob's family is aware of the charges,\" Ballin wrote in an email. \"His family loves and supports him and requests privacy during this difficult period in their lives. We have no further comment at this time.\"The Wall Street Journal reported on Hartheimer's firing from Evolve Bank on Friday. Evolve said its finance chief, Mark Mosteller, and its general counsel, Joelle Weltzin, will be in charge of the bank's operations, as they were before the bank hired Hartheimer in August.\"We are in close contact with the U.S. Attorney's office and have been assured that this is a personal matter and does not relate to the Bank or its operations in any way,\" the spokesperson wrote in an email.Last year, Evolve was caught up in the bankruptcy of financial technology startup Synapse, which cut off access to a system for handling transactions and account details. Fintech apps such as Yotta worked with Evolve and other banks, with Synapse acting as a middleman.Synapse's method of keeping app users' money in various banks, including Evolve, created accounting problems, and up to $96 million in deposits went missing. Thousands of Americans lost money, CNBC reported.In 2024, Evolve also suffered a cyberattack, during which hackers obtained customer information and demanded a ransom. The bank said it did not pay any ransom and the data was eventually posted online.\"This is a structural change, demonstrating our continued commitment to doing the hard work to earn back the trust of our customers, employees, regulators, and investors,\" Evolve said in an August statement announcing the selection of Hartheimer to replace CEO Scott Stafford, who retired after joining in 2004.The bank touted Hartheimer's experience as director of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation's Division of Resolutions, as well as his years as a regulatory consultant for fintech companies.\"Over the past four decades, I've led, turned around, and advised institutions across the financial landscape,\" Hartheimer wrote on his LinkedIn profile. The 100-year-old bank reported net losses for each of the first three quarters of 2025 after being profitable since 2003, according to data on file with the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council.— CNBC's Dan Mangan and Hugh Son contributed reporting.Disclosure: Comcast is the parent company of NBCUniversal, which owns CNBC.

    "body": "Onuma Inthapong | E+ | Getty ImagesCompany: Advanced Drainage Systems (WMS)Business: Advanced Drainage Systems is a manufacturer of stormwater and onsite wastewater solutions. The company and its subsidiary, Infiltrator Water Technologies, provide stormwater drainage and onsite wastewater products used in a wide variety of markets and applications, including commercial, residential, infrastructure and agriculture, while delivering customer service. Its pipe segment manufactures and markets thermoplastic corrugated pipe throughout the United States. Its infiltrator segment is a provider of plastic leachfield chambers and systems, septic tanks and accessories, primarily for use in residential applications. Its international segment manufactures and markets products in regions outside the United States, with a strategy focused on its owned facilities in Canada and those markets serviced through its joint ventures in Mexico and South America. Its Allied Products segment manufactures a range of products which are complementary to their pipe products.Stock Market Value: : $11.98 billion ($144.10 per share)Activist: Impactive CapitalOwnership: 2.14%Average Cost: n/aActivist Commentary: Impactive Capital is an activist hedge fund founded in 2018 by Lauren Taylor Wolfe and Christian Alejandro Asmar. Impactive Capital is an active ESG investor that launched with a $250 million investment from CalSTRS and now has approximately $3 billion. In just seven years, they have made quite a name for themselves as AESG investors. Wolfe and Asmar realized that there was an opportunity to use tools, notably on the social and environmental side, to drive returns. Impactive focuses on positive systemic change to help build more competitive, sustainable businesses for the long run. Impactive will use traditional operational, financial and strategic tools that activists use, but will also implement ESG change that they believe is material to the business and drives profitability of the company and shareholder value. Impactive looks for high quality businesses that are usually complex and mispriced, where they can underwrite a minimum of a high teens or low 20% internal rate of return over a three- to five-year holding period, and have active engagement with management to set up multiple ways to win.What's happeningOn Oct. 21, Impactive said they had taken a position in Advanced Drainage Systems.Behind the scenesAdvanced Drainage Systems is the market share leader in plastic stormwater and onsite septic wastewater management solutions. The company is a pioneer in the development and manufacturing of plastic drainage products, primarily utilizing high-density polyethylene (HDPE) and polypropylene. Recycled materials made up 46% of WMS' purchased inputs in fiscal year 2025, making it one of the largest recyclers in North America. The company has three primary business lines: (i) Pipe - storm and drainage pipe, 56% of FY25 revenue; (ii) Allied Products - complementary products to its pipe offerings like storm chambers, structures and fittings, 26%; and (iii) Infiltrator - chambers, tanks and advanced wastewater treatment solutions, 18%. Between its three segments, the company has a $15 billion addressable market and is the clear industry leader with 75% to 95% market share across its segments.There is a lot to like about WMS, as it is an extremely high-quality and well-run company with a long history of compounding growth and secular tailwinds. As a result, WMS has an impressive track record, having grown earnings per share almost 10x since its initial public offering, and has a 28% EPS compound annual growth rate with returns on invested capital consistently above 20%. Management is also very focused on shareholder value and are great capital allocators, increasing dividends and launching buybacks in most years where it does not see a compelling M&A opportunity. Despite this, the company's share price performance has been lackluster over the past 1- and 3-year periods, underperforming the Russell 2000, and its stock has re-rated down to a P/E multiple in the low-to-mid 20s. The reason for this is twofold: investor fears regarding the cyclicality of construction spending and margin compression. However, Impactive Capital believes that both concerns appear to be overblown or misplaced and that management has built this business to protect its top line from market cyclicality and make margin expansion structural, not cyclical. As to the cyclicality of construction spending, construction spending is down 3% year to date as higher interest rates and affordability concerns have dampened residential and non-residential construction spending, setting this up to be the worst year for construction in the past two decades aside from the global financial crisis. But company revenue has not been declining and is not expected to decline for several reasons. First, plastic pipes have been stealing market share from concrete and steel. Only about 20% of the market in 2010, plastic now exceeds 40% due to it being 20% cheaper than alternatives and offering superior performance. Second, with the 2019 acquisition of Infiltrator and the upcoming acquisition of National Diversified Sales, WMS has increased its exposure to the residential repair and remodel end-market, adding resiliency to its revenue streams. This should also make WMS a natural beneficiary of the reversion in existing home sales, which are currently at a 15-year low. Third, billion-dollar storm events have quintupled since the 1980s, necessitating increased investment in resiliency and more complex stormwater infrastructure. The company also has a wide moat, enabled by its high brand loyalty from contractors, its vertical integration and excellent distribution network. As for margin concerns, there are fears that weakness in construction will lead to margin compression. However, this is something else that management has taken a lot of steps and adopted many initiatives to avoid. Over the past six years, the company has been diversifying its business toward its higher-margin Allied Product and Infiltrator offerings, both of which have adjusted operating margins in the mid-50s, whereas pipe is around 30%. Additionally, one of its largest input costs are oil and resin, and WMS has a unique way to mitigate these costs. The company toggles between recycled and virgin resins depending on the price of oil. So, when oil spikes, they use recycled resin, and when it drops, they switch to virgin resin and capture better margins. WMS is the only one of its competitors who can do this at scale. Moreover, when construction is weak, oil and resin prices tend to decline. So, loss to the top line can be made up on the bottom line as the decline in resin prices is more than enough to offset end-market weaknesses (i.e., construction spending is down about 3% YTD, resin prices are down 15% to 20%). As a result, pipe and Allied Products adjusted EBITDA margins have expanded by about 8 percentage points since 2020, but some fear that this will eventually normalize.However, Impactive believes that this shift is structural, not cyclical and WMS will not only avoid margin compression but could see gross margin expand by 100 bps over the next 12-24 months; something that is not factored into forward consensus estimates.As a result of this confluence of factors, Impactive models that WMS will return to mid-teens EPS growth and projects a base case three-year total return and IRR of 69% and 19%, respectively, and an upside case of 146% and 34%, respectively.Ken Squire is the founder and president of 13D Monitor, an institutional research service on shareholder activism, and the founder and portfolio manager of the 13D Activist Fund, a mutual fund that invests in a portfolio of activist investments.",

    "body": "At one point, it was Europe's most valuable company. Now, as Danish pharmaceutical group Novo Nordisk prepares to publish its third-quarter earnings on Wednesday, the picture looks very different.Jonathan Raa | Nurphoto | Getty ImagesCNBC's Charlotte Reed will travel to Copenhagen to speak with the company's new CEO Mark Doustdar, a 30-year veteran of the company, who has been in the top job since August. It's not been an easy ride so far, with the group announcing a sharp decline in sales, pressure on profit, a round of jobs cuts and continued competition from U.S. rivals when it comes to the blockbuster obesity drug market.Analysts' viewsDespite this, Berenberg is positive on the stock, saying Novo has hit \"peak uncertainty.\"\"Novo's superior growth profile and best-in-class R&D returns warrants a higher valuation premium to its peers,\" the bank added. Other analysts are less forgiving. Jefferies recently cut the stock's rating to underperform, citing competitive pressure in the U.S. and pricing concerns. Meanwhile, UBS analysts are concerned Novo's 8 billion Danish krone ($1.23 billion) one-off cost related to its restructuring has not been fully reflected on the bottom line, while adding that investors are continuing to question the group's lack of consumer experience in the American market.On Oct. 17, U.S. President Donald Trump told a press conference that the price of Novo's blockbuster weight-loss drug Ozempic would be \"much lower\" as part of the administration's negotiations over pricing with the company.The share price has been under pressure since the start of the year.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconTough year for Novo Nordisk sharesBoardroom meltdownEarnings releases this week:Monday: Ryanair, Berkshire HathawayTuesday: BP, Philips, Ferrari, Uber, PfizerWednesday: Novo Nordisk, BMW, Orsted, ARM, McDonald'sThursday: Astrazeneca, Commerzbank, Diageo, ArcelorMittal, AirBnBFriday: Daimler",

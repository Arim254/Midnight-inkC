    "body": "Jocelyn Elizabeth was a new mom working part-time as a marketing administrator when her dad brought home a $5 lamp from a church yard sale in Dillsburg, Pennsylvania.It was 2011, Elizabeth says. Though the lamp wasn't fancy or new, her dad was sure he'd made a good investment, and found a cleaned-up version of the same lamp listed at $70 on eBay. Elizabeth says she promptly went thrifting the next weekend, intending to flip her finds for a profit online, her baby son tagging along in a stroller.Elizabeth, who uses her middle name professionally and asked not to share her last name, now makes her full-time living from her thrifting-centric YouTube channel Crazy Lamp Lady and her online thrifting marketplace NikNax, she says. NikNax hosts more than 5,000 other sellers listing resale items ranging from mugs and glassware to jewelry, books, trading cards and local snacks.NikNax has brought in more than $5.2 million in 2025 revenue, as of Oct. 31, according to documents reviewed by CNBC Make It. Elizabeth, 37, keeps a 5% cut of each sale, meaning she's personally received at least $260,000 from the marketplace so far this year. District, the online platform that hosts NikNax, also takes a 5% cut of each sale.DON'T MISS: The ultimate guide to starting a business—everything you need to know to be your own bossElizabeth also sells her own thrift finds on NikNax, and her store is responsible for about 5% of NikNax's total sales, she says. Her YouTube channel has also brought in roughly $298,000 in 2025 advertising revenue as of Oct. 15, documents show.Both NikNax and the YouTube channel are profitable, says Elizabeth. She employs two other people who help with listing and shipping her thrift finds, she adds. She works about three days per week on NikNax, and two or three days on her YouTube channel — and her working hours vary significantly, she says.\"These days, I spend anywhere from 50 to 100 hours a week working. It really depends on what's going on. Some weeks I'm doing more thrifting trips, and other weeks I'm focused on selling,\" says Elizabeth, a mom of three. \"NikNax has become such a big part of my daily life that even when I'm not actively selling, I'm usually watching other shows, chatting, or listing items. It's technically work, but a lot of it just feels like part of my everyday routine.\"Here's how she built her YouTube channel side hustle and turned thrifting into her full-time job.'It was definitely risky'When Elizabeth first discovered thrift flipping in 2011, she was making $14 per hour at a part-time corporate marketing job, she says. Soon, she started traveling to antique shows and stores across the U.S., studying the vintage and collectible secondary market and developing an eye for items with a higher resale value.By April 2016, she felt unfulfilled sending marketing emails to clients every day, she says — so she decided to launch a YouTube channel dedicated to her thrifting. Her first inkling that this could become a real money-making business was the first time she made $600 in advertising revenue in one day, she says.\"I remember having to pull over my car and just be like, 'What in the world is happening?'\" says Elizabeth.By the end of 2018, Elizabeth was \"consistently earning more from YouTube than from my part-time job,\" she says — so she quit her marketing gig that December. \"I was like, 'You know what? I don't want to be here anymore' ... It was definitely risky, and it was scary.\"Roughly six months later, Elizabeth had a house full of antiques and five employees, two who listed items on eBay and three who packed and shipped them. Elizabeth says she brought on three more employees during the Covid-19 pandemic, as declining ad revenue pushed her to try selling more on eBay. She also grew dissatisfied with seller fees on the platform, she says.In October 2023, she launched a marketplace on District — an internet platform founded in 2022 — after being invited by a company representative who'd seen her YouTube channel. District currently hosts 98 marketplaces, according to its website, including NikNax.Elizabeth also rents a commercial space to store her own thrift finds, and a separate operating space for day-to-day responsibilities like listing and shipping orders. Combined, those spaces roughly cost $2,000 to $3,000 per month including utilities, she says.The challenges of owning a marketplaceOwning a marketplace — rather than just being a seller — presents a new set of challenges, Elizabeth says. Online trends shift quickly, and staying on top of them can be difficult. Livestream sales, where you sell items in real time to buyers actively watching your live video feed, are a major sales driver for NikNax, but Elizabeth wasn't initially comfortable in front of a live camera, she says.She's also responsible for enforcing platform rules, like removing people who make rude comments or determining whether a buyer is falsely claiming that an item wasn't shipped to get an illicit refund.Building a community of buyers and sellers, on the other hand, was fairly easy, she says: She brought some of her YouTube audience with her, and now casts many of her NikNax livestreams on YouTube and other social channels to market the platform.Elizabeth has used some of her earnings to invest in real estate, purchasing an Airbnb rental property and a separate rental home in Pennsylvania. Each three-bedroom house cost around $300,000, she says. The Airbnb runs guests roughly $300 per night, including fees, according to the rental platform.Anyone can replicate her experience — from thrift flipping to YouTube and NikNax — to a certain degree, as long as you have the \"drive\" and dedication, she says. She travels the country at least once a month looking for thrift items to flip, while filming and editing online content and livestreaming multiple times per week, she says.Still, even if you only have a few dollars in your pocket, you could turn that into a profit if you know what to look for, she notes.\"I think anyone can do it if they put the work in,\" says Elizabeth. \"Anyone could go to Goodwill and pick something up and be like, 'Oh my gosh, how much is this worth?' And find out it's worth $50 ... If you're willing to put in the work, if you're willing to learn, I think anyone can really accomplish this.\"Earn more and get ahead with CNBC's online courses.

    "body": "Paramount Skydance CEO David Ellison speaks during the Bloomberg Screentime conference in Los Angeles on October 9, 2025.Patrick T. Fallon | Afp | Getty ImagesThis isn't exactly what David Ellison had planned in September. Just a few months ago, the Paramount Skydance CEO sent a letter to the Warner Bros. Discovery board of directors arguing a combination of the two media and entertainment companies made sense. That letter was the first of several that offered increasingly higher prices to acquire the company along with arguments of why the assets were better together.Paramount's interest spurred a formal sale process — bringing Comcast and Netflix into the mix — which ultimately doubled the value of Warner Bros. Discovery shares and culminated, at least for the moment, in Paramount losing out in the bidding war it started.  On Friday, Netflix announced a deal to acquire HBO Max and the famed Warner Bros. film studio for $27.75 per share, or an equity value of $72 billion. WBD will move forward with a plan to separate out its pay-TV networks, such as CNN and TNT Sports, before the deal closes. Instead of supercharging Paramount, just months after gaining control of the company through a merger with Skydance, Ellison effectively handed a prized jewel of the media and entertainment industry to its most dominant player, strengthening Netflix's reach and stripping Paramount and Comcast's NBCUniversal of an obvious merger target. \"It wasn't for sale before, and they certainly hadn't cleaned up the assets or separated the assets in the way they have right now,\" said Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos in a conference call Friday morning after announcing the deal. \"I think that kind of goes to the 'why now.'\"Ellison jump-started a process that has made a lot of money for Warner Bros. Discovery CEO David Zaslav, WBD's executive team and its shareholders. Zaslav's shareZaslav currently owns more than 4.2 million shares of Warner Bros. Discovery, with another 6.2 million shares that would be delivered to him in the future via previously granted stock awards, according to Equilar. Zaslav also has a grant of almost 20.9 million options with an exercise price of $10.16, Equilar found.Based on the Netflix-WBD transaction price of $27.75 per share, all of that adds up to more than $554 million for the WBD CEO. Factoring in another 4 million shares that Zaslav is set to receive in January, according to a person close to the situation who declined to be named speaking about the executive's holdings, the true total is closer to $660 million.For shareholders, the sale process has brought a similar windfall. Warner Bros. Discovery stock closed at $12.54 on Sept. 10, the day before The Wall Street Journal reported Paramount was preparing a bid for the company. On Friday morning, Warner Bros. Discovery shares were up almost 3% to more than $25 apiece. That's more than double Warner Bros. Discovery's unaffected sale process price and a return to 2022 levels when WarnerMedia and Discovery first merged. That's vindication for Zaslav, who has spent nearly four years coming under fire from Hollywood and investors for failing to deliver for shareholders. With Friday's announcement, he's effectively pulled victory from the jaws of defeat. And still, Paramount is likely not done with its pursuit of buying all of Warner Bros. Discovery.Paramount's hostile playEllison has wasted no time at the helm of Paramount Skydance, transforming the company through deals and acquisitions.Since the merger closed in August, Paramount has brought on C-suite executives and high-profile Hollywood talent such as the Duffer Brothers. It secured the rights to develop a live-action feature film based on Activision's Call of Duty video game franchise and struck a $7.7 billion deal for UFC rights. Ellison's hunt for Warner Bros. Discovery was his biggest endeavor since taking control of the company.Paramount's lawyers sent a letter to Warner Bros. Discovery this week, first reported by CNBC, claiming the sale process had been rigged in Netflix's direction. Paramount has accused Warner Bros. Discovery of failing to properly consider its offer of $30, all-cash, and instead selling to Netflix as a predetermined outcome. Netflix made an initial bid for WBD's studio and streaming assets of $27 a share, according to a person familiar with the matter. That trumped Paramount's offer at the time and turned the trajectory of the sales talks in Netflix's direction, said the person, who asked not to be named because the discussions were private.Paramount was the only bidder interested in acquiring all of WBD's assets — the film studio, streaming service and TV networks. It has maintained that its offer is superior. Paramount's executives and advisors valued the Discovery Global networks portfolio at close to $2 a share, based on its predicted trading multiple and estimated leverage ratio, according to people familiar with the matter, who asked not to be named because the discussions were private. Discovery Global would include the CNN, TNT Sports and Discovery channels.Warner Bros. Discovery believes Discovery Global could have a value of $3 per share or more if it trades well in the public markets, according to other people with direct knowledge of the matter.Paramount has also argued there are tax efficiencies for shareholders in acquiring the whole company rather than buying only a portion of it, and that Netflix's bid comes with steeper regulatory risk. The Trump administration's view of the proposed combination is one of \"heavy skepticism,\" CNBC reported Friday.Paramount offered a break-up fee of $5 billion if the proposed deal didn't get regulatory approval, according to the people familiar.  Netflix's bid included a $5.8 billion break-up fee in case the deal doesn't get regulatory approval, according to a Securities and Exchange Commission filing Friday. Paramount is now weighing its options about whether to go straight to shareholders with one more improved bid — perhaps even higher than the $30-per-share, all-cash offer it submitted to WBD this week. If it does, Netflix would have a chance to match that bid. The end result would mean even more money for WBD shareholders — and more money for Zaslav.— CNBC's Nick Wells contributed to this report. Disclosure: Comcast is the parent company of NBCUniversal, which owns CNBC. Versant would become the new parent company of CNBC upon Comcast’s planned spinoff of Versant.",

    "body": "US President Donald Trump makes an announcement from the Oval Office of the White House in Washington, DC on December 3, 2025. Andrew Caballero-reynolds | Afp | Getty ImagesPresident Donald Trump may remove members of the National Labor Relations Board and the Merit Systems Protection Board at will, a federal appeals court ruled Friday.The 2-1 decision from a panel of judges in Washington, D.C., reverses lower-court rulings blocking Trump's attempts to fire members of the key labor and employment panels.\"Congress may not restrict the President's ability to remove principal officers who wield substantial executive power,\" the two-judge majority wrote, citing a 2020 case known as Seila Law LLC v. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.They determined that another key court precedent, which was cited in the prior rulings that favored the fired board members, did not apply to the NLRB and MSPB.Those boards \"wield substantial powers that are both executive in nature and different from the powers\" that are covered by the removal protections laid out in the 1935 case known as Humphrey's Executor, the majority wrote.\"So, Congress cannot restrict the President's ability to remove NLRB or MSPB members,\" ruled Judges Gregory Katsas and Justin Walker, who were both appointed to the D.C. circuit by Trump.The Trump administration is challenging the 90-year-old precedent set by Humphrey's, which limits the president's ability to unilaterally remove the heads of certain independent government agencies. The Supreme Court on Monday is set to hear oral arguments in a case that could determine whether Humphrey's is overturned. The third judge on the appellate panel, Florence Pan, warned in a strongly worded dissent that Friday's ruling significantly increases the president's power.\"Today, my colleagues make us the first court to strike down the independence of a traditional multimember expert agency,\" Pan, an appointee of former President Joe Biden, wrote.\"Under my colleagues' reasoning, it appears that no independent agencies may lawfully exist in this country,\" she wrote. \"Their determination that the MSPB cannot be independent ... suggests that no agencies can be independent.\"Pan added that her colleagues \"redefine the type of executive power that must be placed under the exclusive command of the President, and effectively grant him dominion over approximately thirty-three previously independent agencies.\"Katsas and Walker noted that their opinion does \"not address whether Congress may restrict the President's ability to remove members of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.\"They pointed to a Supreme Court ruling from May, which, while allowing Trump to temporarily fire two NLRB and MSPB members, identified \"a 'distinct historical tradition' regarding the treatment of congressionally chartered banks, which may bear on Congress's ability to restrict the removal of their officials.\"Trump has tried to remove Fed Governor Lisa Cook, a Biden nominee, while urging the central bank and its chairman, Jerome Powell, to quickly slash U.S. interest rates. Cook sued to block her removal; the Supreme Court is set to hear oral arguments in the case on Jan. 21.Friday's ruling also does not touch on whether Congress can restrict the president's ability to fire members from certain agencies that have \"solely adjudicatory functions,\" Katsas and Walker noted.They cited the \"War Claims Commission,\" a temporary agency established after World War II to adjudicate compensation claims from American prisoners of war, as an example.Katsas and Walker additionally did not weigh in on \"whether wrongfully removed principal officers may obtain declaratory, equitable, or mandatory relief against the President or other government officials,\" they wrote.",

    "body": "Russian President Vladimir Putin is welcomed by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi upon arrival at the Palam Air Base in New Delhi, India December 4, 2025. Grigory Sysoev | Via ReutersRussian President Vladimir Putin has underlined Moscow's willingness to provide \"uninterrupted shipments of fuel\" to India, as the U.S. pressures New Delhi to give up importing their oil. Putin made the offer during a joint address with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday, part of his first visit to the country since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, which triggered widespread sanctions.The sanctions forced Russia to seek new customers for its exports. India has become the second biggest buyer of Russian crude oil, after China, with a report Finland-based Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air showing India bought 38% of Russian crude exports in October.In October, President Donald Trump sanctioned two of Russia's largest oil companies, Rosneft and Lukoil. This followed a tariff of 25% on India for buying Russian oil in August. But India has to walk a tightrope because it has close ties to the U.S. while also relying on Russia for fuel and access to military hardware.Putin questioned U.S. pressure on India in an interview to an Indian television channel on Thursday.The United States still buys nuclear fuel from Russia for its own nuclear power plants, Putin said in the interview, adding: \"If the U.S. has the right to buy our fuel, why shouldn't India have the same privilege?\" While Trump has acknowledged that India has cut back its Russian oil imports, experts told CNBC that this may be a temporary trend. watch nowApart from crude oil, Russia's Rosatom is also delivering reactors and reportedly fuel for India's Kudankulam nuclear power plant in Tamil Nadu, which has a combined capacity of 6000MW. India and Russia have an energy partnership, the Russian president said, adding that Moscow had been is reliable supplier of \"oil, gas, coal and everything that is required for the development of India's energy\".Last month, India announced a \"historic deal\" with Washington, in which Indian state-owned oil companies signed a one-year deal to import around 2.2 million tonnes per annum of liquefied petroleum gas from the U.S.",

    "body": "Dr. Vicky Pebsworth, from left, Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor Retsef Levi, Case Western Reserve University Professor Catherine Stein and Dr. Raymond Pollak, listen to presentations during an Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) meeting to discuss childhood vaccine schedule changes at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, Georgia, U.S., December 4, 2025.Alyssa Pointer | ReutersHealth and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s handpicked vaccine committee voted on Friday to do away with the long-standing, universal recommendation that all babies receive a hepatitis B shot at birth, issuing weaker guidance for certain infants. The group, called the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, or ACIP, recommended that parents use individual decision-making in consultation with a health-care provider to determine when or if to give the hepatitis B birth dose to a baby whose mother tested negative for the virus. For babies who don't receive the birth dose, the committee recommended that they wait to receive a first vaccine until they are at least 2 months old. The acting director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention still has to sign off on that new recommendation. The CDC currently recommends that every baby get vaccinated against hepatitis B within 24 hours of birth, regardless of their mother's testing status. The move overturns that guidance, which has been credited with driving down infections in children by 99% since it was first introduced three decades ago and is widely considered to be a public health success story. Some committee members and public health experts warn that the change could have wide-ranging consequences, such as an increase in infections among kids. The vote only affects the timing of the first dose of the hepatitis B vaccine series. The second would still be given one to two months after birth, with a third dose between 6 and 18 months of age. All pregnant people are supposed to be tested for hepatitis B during pregnancy. During previous meetings, some advisors questioned the need for babies to receive a shot if their mothers test negative. But test results can produce false negatives, some people become infected later in pregnancy after being tested and babies can get infected by other members of their household. The panel's closely watched two-day meeting in Atlanta comes after Kennedy gutted the committee and appointed 12 new members, including some well-known vaccine critics. ACIP sets recommendations on who should receive certain shots and which vaccines insurers must cover at no cost. Eight members voted yes, while three voted no. Some advisors strongly pushed back on the new guidance ahead of the vote. \"This has a great potential to cause harm, and I hope that the committee accepts the responsibility when this harm is caused,\" said Dr. Joseph Hibbeln, psychiatrist and voting member. Dr. Cody Meissner, voting member and professor of pediatrics at the Dartmouth Geisel School of Medicine, said he hopes that pediatricians will continue to administer the birth dose within the first 24 hours of delivery and before discharge from the hospital. \"To follow any other course is not in the interest of infants,\" he said. Meissner added that more children will be injured and will catch hepatitis B infections. Hepatitis B, which can be passed from mother to baby during childbirth, can lead to liver disease and early death. Infants are more vulnerable to developing chronic hepatitis B infections, which have no cure. \"We will see hepatitis B come back,\" he said. \"The vaccine is so effective. It does not make sense in my mind to change the immunization schedule.\"In a statement Friday, the American Medical Association said the vote is \"reckless and undermines decades of public confidence in a proven, lifesaving vaccine.\" The group added that the decision was not based on scientific evidence and \"creates confusion for parents about how best to protect their newborns.\"Meanwhile, Retsef Levi, a voting member and Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor, falsely claimed during meetings that experts have \"never tested\" the hepatitis B vaccine \"appropriately.\" Some committee members raised concerns about vaccinating during the so-called neonatal period, which is a critical window of development for the brain and immune system. But decades of evidence show that the hepatitis B shot has been safely administered to newborns. Other advisors said there is no evidence supporting the two-month delay to the birth dose.\"We have to make decisions with the data that we have, and we must use only the credible data to make the decisions, and not speculations and not hypotheses,\" said Hibbeln. A 2024 CDC study showed that the current vaccination schedule has helped prevent more than 6 million hepatitis B infections and nearly 1 million hepatitis B-related hospitalizations.Merck and GSK manufacture the hepatitis B vaccines used starting at birth. Neither of the shots are significant revenue drivers for the companies, so the new recommendations should not have a material impact on their businesses. Still, Merck said in a statement Friday that it is \"deeply concerned\" by the vote, which it said risks \"reversing this progress and puts infants at unnecessary risk of chronic infection, liver cancer and even death.\" The company added that \"there is no evidence delaying it provides any benefit to children.\" In a statement, GSK said, \"we await additional information and an official adoption of today's recommendations by CDC to fully understand the potential impact.\"The panel's vote will not affect insurance coverage for the shots, including under Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program, Andrew Johnson, principal policy analyst for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid, told the members during the meeting.

    "body": "People hold a sign as they participate in a protest outside the U.S. Supreme Court over President Donald Trump's move to end birthright citizenship as the court hears arguments over the order in Washington, May 15, 2025.Drew Angerer | Afp | Getty ImagesThe Supreme Court on Friday said it will hear arguments in a case that will determine if President Donald Trump can undo automatic citizenship for people born in the United States.Trump, on his first day back in the White House on Jan. 20, issued an executive order that said babies born in the U.S. more than 30 days after that order were not entitled to be issued citizenship documents if their parents were temporary visitors or illegal aliens.Before Trump's order, there was little dispute that the U.S. Constitution's 14th Amendment, with rare exceptions, meant that children born in the country were automatically U.S. citizens, regardless of their parents' status.The Citizenship Clause in that amendment says, \"All persons born or naturalized in the United  States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the  United States.\" The Supreme Court, which is expected to rule next year, will determine if Trump's executive order complies with that amendment.The order told federal agencies to refuse to recognize the citizenship of children born in the U.S. if their mother \"was unlawfully present in the United States and the person's father was not a United States citizen or lawful  permanent resident at the time of said person's birth,\" or when the baby's \"mother's presence in the United States was lawful but  temporary, and the person's father was not a United States citizen or  lawful permanent resident at the time.\"Several federal district court judges have found the order violated the Constitution, and two federal circuit courts of appeals upheld injunctions blocking the order from taking effect.\\",

    "body": "Russian President Vladimir Putin smiles while visiting the We Are Together Fourm and Awards Ceremony, on December 3, 2025 in Moscow, Russia. Contributor | Getty ImagesRussian President Vladimir Putin has warned Moscow will take Ukrainian territory by force if Kyiv's troops do not withdraw, signaling rigidity over a key sticking point in peace talks. \"Either we liberate these territories by force of arms, or Ukrainian troops leave these territories,\" Putin, who is currently on a state visit to India, said in an interview with India Today. The comments, published by Russian state-controlled media, were translated by news agency Reuters and made in reference to Ukraine's eastern Donbas region.Russia is estimated to control more than 80% of the Donbas, where fighting between Ukrainian forces and Russian-backed separatists started long before Russia's full-scale invasion of 2022. The war in the region first began in 2014, when Russia invaded and annexed Crimea — a peninsular in southern Ukraine. Capturing and officially annexing the Donbas region would enable Russia to create a land bridge to Crimea, a crucial military and trading hub for Moscow. Under occupation, so-called referendums have shown up to 99% of residents in parts of the Donbas region voted to join the Russian Federation. Those referendums have been widely criticized as sham votes by the international community. Putin's comments came after he held a five-hour meeting with U.S. delegates Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner — U.S. President Donald Trump's son in law — in Moscow on Tuesday. During Thursday's interview with India Today, Putin said Russia did not agree with some of the points outlined in the reworked U.S. peace proposals for Ukraine, labeling the negotiation process \"difficult work.\"'Unlikely any time soon'The original 28-point peace plan — drawn up by Russian and American officials, with no input from Ukraine — reportedly included a requirement that Ukraine concede territory in the Donbas to Russia. It was redrafted following talks between the U.S. and Ukraine, whose president Volodymyr Zelenskyy has repeatedly stated that any peace deal must honor Ukrainian sovereignty. Marnie Howlett, a lecturer in Russian and East European politics at the University of Oxford, told CNBC on Friday that the war would only end when Russia stops attacking Ukraine. \"Given the Kremlin shows a lack of genuine interest in ending the conflict, no peace agreement is likely any time soon,\" she said. \"Russia has failed to take Donbas by force since 2014, as Ukrainians have made clear they will not accept the illegal capture of their territory. No 'deal' is possible without Ukrainians' support, and nearly 12 years of resistance show that they are unwilling to support territorial concessions.\"watch nowEmily Ferris, a senior research fellow at defense and security thinktank the Royal United Services Institute, agreed that Moscow is unlikely to be truly invested in making peace in Ukraine without land concessions being on the table. \"Currently, Russia sees no reason to come to the negotiating table because it is making – admittedly small – gains on the battlefield and there is no offer that meets their demands,\" she told CNBC. \"The two sticking points are European military support for Ukraine – the so-called security guarantees and what that actually means – and of course the territorial issue, which Moscow is counting on Ukraine to compromise on.\"Speaking at the 2025 Investor Summit conference at the London Stock Exchange on Thursday, Kim Darroch, who served as the U.K.'s ambassador to the U.S. during Trump's first term, said he did not believe an end to the conflict in Ukraine was imminent. \"I don't think the war is going to end anytime soon, unless the Ukrainians agree to capitulate and give up territory, plus to never join NATO and this kind of stuff which I think is basically impossible to concede and survive politically,\" he told an audience. \"So, I think the war will drag on through the winter and beyond, which potentially is very dangerous for Europe, because I think if Trump can't get a deal he may just walk away and stop weapons supplies to Ukraine and tell the Europeans, 'it's your problem, I tried to get a deal, so you do it.' And then I'm not sure we actually have the capacity to provide Ukraine with what it needs.\" Global investors have been closely monitoring developments in the negotiations, with a breakthrough likely to have implications for markets across asset classes. Moscow's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022 sparked an international sell-off of equities and huge volatility in energy markets as the Western world drastically reduced trade and investment in Russia. Concerns about Russian aggression have also led to a huge defense splurge across Europe, fueling a bull run on regional defense stocks. — CNBC's Holly Ellyatt contributed to this article. ",

The move represents the firm's most significant leadership change since Teng succeeded Zhao, who pleaded guilty to violating U.S. money-laundering laws in 2023. Teng, who was appointed amid intense regulatory scrutiny of Binance and crypto more broadly, notably had a background in financial regulation and services, formerly holding a senior regulatory role at Singapore's central bank.\"[Yi He] has been there from the start, and she has been driving a lot of changes and driving the growth of Binance,\" Teng told CNBC's Dan Murphy on Wednesday shortly after the announcement.watch nowYi He's elevation to the co-CEO position represents the appointment of an insider with longstanding ties to Zhao, also known as CZ.The move comes after U.S. President Donald Trump pardoned CZ, who had previously pleaded guilty to enabling money laundering while heading the cryptocurrency exchange.The Trump administration has taken a friendlier stance toward the crypto industry, with several high-profile cases dropped in recent months. Queen behind the scenesYi He has maintained a relatively low public profile compared to CZ, with many details regarding her roles and activities at Binance unclear. Her social profiles list her most recent position as Chief Customer Service Officer at the crypto exchange.One of the last major public statements from the businesswoman was in defense of CZ during his 2024 trial, among 161 letters requesting leniency from the court.In her letter written in Chinese, Yi He identified herself as CZ's business partner and \"the mother of his three children.\"She claimed that she met CZ at a public blockchain event in 2014, three years before Binance was founded. She was then working at cryptocurrency exchange OKCoin and recruited CZ to join her.\"As CZ's life partner, I've known him for nearly ten years, so I understand a side of him that's often overlooked,\" she wrote in the 2024 letter defending him.Binance said in a statement Wednesday that Yi He has \"played a fundamental role in shaping Binance's vision and culture, guiding a strategy focused on users' needs and innovation.\"The company also included a public statement from Yi He, in which she emphasized her and Teng's \"complementary perspectives and shared vision.\" \"Together, we bring diverse perspectives and are confident in leading the future of the industry during this pivotal time, as we responsibly expand our global presence and drive sustainable innovation with our users always at the center,\" she said.watch nowFederal probes into Binance have also referenced her role in the company. In 2020, U.S. prosecutors reportedly sought records of communications involving Yi He and other executives related to anti-money laundering compliance and the creation of Binance's U.S. entity.Media reports have previously painted Yi He as a \"Crypto Queen\" wielding massive sway behind the scenes at Binance. According to a report from the Wall Street Journal in 2023,  Yi He was a former Chinese talk-show host before joining OKCoin, and she entered a relationship with CZ while working together in Shanghai. The report added that He would assume sweeping control over the crypto giant's marketing and investment divisions. Binance and Yi He did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment.",

    "body": "Lisa Jackson, senior vice president of environment, policy and social initiatives at Apple Inc., speaks during the TechCrunch Disrupt 2017 in San Francisco, California, U.S., on Tuesday, Sept. 19, 2017. David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesApple's general counsel, Kate Adams, and its vice president for environment, policy, and social initiatives, Lisa Jackson, are retiring from the company, the iPhone maker announced on Thursday. Jennifer Newstead, Meta's chief legal officer, will become Apple's new general counsel in March, and Jackson's government affairs staff will report to her starting late next year, Apple said. The two executives, who both reported to Apple CEO Tim Cook, are the latest members of senior leadership to exit the company. In recent weeks, Apple's head software designer said he was leaving to join Meta, while Apple said its AI chief was retiring, along with its chief operating officer.Adams joined Apple from Honeywell and became general counsel in 2017, and oversaw legal matters including litigation, global security, and the company's privacy initiatives. Under Adams, Apple grappled with rising antitrust scrutiny and regulation around the world, including major lawsuits in the U.S. over the iPhone App Store's restrictions and fees. Jackson joined Apple in 2013, and led the company's diversity programs as well as much of its policy work in Washington, D.C. Before that, she spent four years as administrator of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, a position she was appointed to by President Barack Obama. With her emphasis in areas like social justice and renewable energies, Jackson's job lost relevance during the second Trump administration, which has publicly denounced diversity, equity and inclusion programs and slammed efforts to combat climate change. Apple has faced increased tariffs from the Trump administration, and Cook has met with President Donald Trump several times to tout the company's American manufacturing plans as part of an effort to influence policy. Jackson was instrumental in Apple's launch of its Racial Equity and Justice Initiative following the 2020 murder of George Floyd. She then helped expand the company's equity and justice efforts to other countries, including the U.K., Mexico and New Zealand, according to a report published in 2023.\"At Apple, we pledge that our resolve will not fade,\" Jackson wrote in a section of that report. \"We won't delay action. We will work, each and every day, on the urgent task of advancing equity.\"Jackson also worked on Apple's environmental image. Her job \"focused on reducing greenhouse gases, protecting air and water quality, preventing exposure to toxic contamination, and expanding outreach to communities on environmental issues,\" according to her bio on the company's website. She discussed Apple's plans to become carbon neutral at iPhone launch events.Jackson also accompanied Cook to several official functions in Washington, including state dinners. Apple CEO Tim Cook and Apple Vice President Lisa Jackson arrive at the White House for a state dinner on April 10, 2024 in Washington, DC. Tasos Katopodis | Getty ImagesNewstead, who will become Apple's top lawyer, has overseen Meta's legal and regulatory matters pertaining to its family of apps like Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp since 2019. A Meta spokesperson said Newstead will be staying through the end of the year and that the company is actively searching for her replacement.Prior to Meta, Newstead served as a Trump-appointed legal advisor at the State Department during the president's first administration in 2019.  Before that, she was a partner at Davis Polk & Wardwell and a general counsel of the White House Office of Management and Budget, among other roles in the U.S. government.CNBC's Jonathan Vanian contributed to this story.WATCH: Apple AI chief steps downwatch now",

    "body": "The Trump administration views the proposed $72 billion deal for Netflix to acquire Warner Bros. Discovery's film and streaming assets with \"heavy skepticism,\" a senior administration official told CNBC's Eamon Javers on Friday morning.Netflix said Friday that it would acquire Warner Bros.' film studio and streaming service, HBO Max. The deal is subject to regulatory approval.Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., said, \"This deal looks like an anti-monopoly nightmare.\"\"A Netflix-Warner Bros. would create one massive media giant with control of close to half of the streaming market — threatening to force Americans into higher subscription prices and fewer choices over what and how they watch, while putting American workers at risk,\" Warren said in a statement.\"Under Donald Trump, the antitrust review process has also become a cesspool of political favoritism and corruption,\" Warren said. \"The Justice Department must enforce our nation's anti-monopoly laws fairly and transparently — not use the Warner Bros. deal review to invite influence-peddling and bribery.\"Paramount Skydance had made multiple bids for the entirety of WBD, as opposed to a subset of the company's assets. Paramount's final bid, which was received Thursday evening, was for $30 per share, all cash, CNBC previously reported. Comcast also made a bid for WBD's film and streaming properties.The New York Post on Thursday reported that, \"Paramount Skydance chief David Ellison met with Trump officials and key lawmakers in Washington DC on Wednesday to press his case against Warner Bros. Discovery's potential selection of Netflix as its merger partner.\"Ellison's billionaire father, Larry Ellison, is close to President Donald Trump.On Thursday, The Wall Street Journal reported that Paramount, in a letter to lawyers for WBD, had warned that a sale to Netflix likely would \"never close\" because of regulatory challenges in the United States and overseas.\"Acquiring Warner's streaming and studio assets 'will entrench and extend Netflix's global dominance in a matter not allowed by domestic or foreign competition laws,' Paramount's lawyers wrote,\" the Journal reported.Netflix's purchase of WBD's assets is expected to close, if approved by regulators, after WBD completes its previously planned spinout of Discovery Global, which is currently planned to occur in the third quarter of 2026.Discovery Global would include the CNN, TNT Sports and Discovery channels. A Securities and Exchange Commission filing shows that Netflix agreed to pay a $5.8 billion reverse break-up fee if the deal does not receive approval.CNBC requested comment from Netflix, WBD, Paramount, and Comcast.Trump, even before taking office for his first term in the White House, opposed a deal by AT&T to buy Time Warner, saying \"it's too much concentration of power in the hands of too few.\" After he took office, the Department of Justice in November 2017 sued in an effort to prevent the merger.The DOJ lost that lawsuit, and the merger was closed in June 2018.Before the 2024 presidential election, Trump opposed the then-proposed sale of U.S. Steel to Nippon Steel of Japan. But after reentering the White House in January, Trump in June signed an executive order approving the merger, after the companies signed a national security agreement with the U.S. government.The agreement gave the U.S. government a \"golden share\" in the merged company, which Trump claims gives a president \"total control.\" Experts said the share gives the government an outsized say in corporate governance.Correction: A senior administration official said the Trump administration views the deal with 'heavy skepticism.' A previous version mischaracterized the official.Disclosure: Comcast is the parent company of NBCUniversal, which owns CNBC. Versant would become the new parent company of CNBC upon Comcast's planned spinoff of Versant.",

    "body": "A man walks past movie posters at at AMC Theater in Montebello, California on May 5, 2025. Frederic J. Brown | AFP | Getty ImagesMovie theater operators woke up Friday to the possibility of a new world order.Netflix and Warner Bros. Discovery announced a deal for the streaming giant to acquire WBD's film studio and streaming service, bringing an end to a months-long bidding process that saw Paramount Skydance and Comcast also vying for the assets.With Netflix as the victor, exhibitors are in a panic. Unlike traditional movie studios, the streamer has not adhered to conventional theatrical distribution, and there are fears that big changes could be coming to an industry that is still struggling post-pandemic.\"It's no secret that this was probably the least desired outcome for many theater owners,\" said Shawn Robbins, director of analytics at Fandango and founder of Box Office Theory. \"There are no two ways around that. This may be one of the most meaningful days in the history of the business, but it could yet be a constructive one for cinema if Netflix honors early indications that it will maintain the theatrical business model of Warner Bros. properties and lean into those unique strengths which are not replicable on the streaming platform.\"Cinema United, the world's largest exhibition trade association, came out strong Friday morning against the sale of WBD assets to Netflix.\"The proposed acquisition of Warner Bros. by Netflix poses an unprecedented threat to the global exhibition business,\" CEO Michael O'Leary said in a statement. \"The negative impact of this acquisition will impact theatres from the biggest circuits to one-screen independents in small towns in the United States and around the world.\"A half dozen movie theater operators who spoke to CNBC shared concerns that Netflix's acquisition of WBD would lead to a significant decline in the number of films made available to cinemas annually and, therefore, hit annual box office ticket sales.\"Netflix's stated business model does not support theatrical exhibition. In fact, it is the opposite,\" O'Leary said. Cinema United said the deal \"would risk removing 25% of the annual domestic box office\" putting smaller theater chains and independent cinemas, in particular, at risk.watch now\"We are going to be pulling all of the levers we can because we think that a deal of this magnitude and the potential impact that it will have is something that everyone with regulatory and oversight authority needs to look closely at,\" O'Leary said on CNBC's \"Squawk on the Street\" Friday. \"So, we've already been talking to people at the federal level, at the state level and internationally because this is a significant, significant threat, we believe, to the long-term viability of the theatrical exhibition.\"And Cinema United isn't the only group worried about the future of the industry if the Netflix deal is approved.A collective of top industry players sent an open letter to Congress detailing the potential economic and institutional blowback that could play out if the merger goes through.The letter, reported by Variety, stated that Netflix would \"effectively hold a noose around the theatrical marketplace\" and could alter the footprint of theatrical movies and decrease licensing fees paid in post-theatrical windows.An uncertain futureSeveral exhibitors told CNBC that they fear a deal between WBD and Netflix will result in fewer theatrical releases and even shorter theatrical windows for would-be major releases.Consolidation in the studio space has been a growing issue for the theatrical industry in recent years. When studios merge, they typically decrease the number of films they produce, something the industry saw firsthand when Disney bought 20th Century Fox back in 2019.The theatrical business has struggled in recent years from pandemic related production shutdowns as well as dual labor strikes that halted film shoots and delayed movie releases. The industry still has not returned to pre-pandemic release numbers or box office ticket sales, and there are worries that it never will.\"If you look historically, when legacy studios are absorbed by other entities, even in the case where those other entities are also legacy studios, the amount of movies produced for theatrical distribution goes down,\" O'Leary told CNBC Friday. Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos said during an investor call Friday morning following the deal announcement that planned Warner Bros. releases \"will continue to go to the theaters through Warner Bros.\"Sarandos doesn't plan to alter WBD's current business practices, a person familiar with the matter told CNBC, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss private conversations. Still, he does plan to meet with theater owners in an effort to assuage any concerns and to explain his vision that movies should have shorter exclusive theatrical windows, the person said. For exhibitors, shrinking theatrical windows pose a major threat. Prior to the pandemic, movies typically played in theaters for between 70 and 90 days before entering the home market. Following Covid shutdowns, studios and cinemas renegotiated these terms, and the average window fell to 30 to 45 days.Netflix, however, has never followed these guidelines. The company has long held that its content is meant for its streaming subscribers and therefore should be delivered to them at home, on the service as soon as possible. If Netflix does release a film in cinemas, it's usually only for the minimum requirement to be eligible for awards contention or for weekend stints as one-off events. When Netflix does go to theaters, it doesn't report box office figures publicly. That's left industry analysts wondering if the company will continue WBD's transparency when it comes to ticket sales once the deal is finalized.\"We've released about 30 films into theaters this year, so it's not like we have this opposition to movies in the theaters,\" Sarandos said during Friday's investor call. \"My pushback has been mostly in the fact of the long exclusive windows, which we don't really think are that consumer friendly.\"\"Netflix movies will take the same strides they have, which is some of them do have a short run in the theater beforehand, but our primary goal is to bring first-run movies to our members, because that's what they're looking for,\" he said. Of course, that strategy could shift in the coming years. Alicia Reese, an analyst at Wedbush, highlighted in a research note Friday that the theatrical slate has already been negotiated through 2029.\"So any buyer would have to honor those contracts by showing the slated WBD films in theaters for at least the next four years,\" Reese wrote.One theater chain operator, speaking on the condition of anonymity to share candid thoughts, told CNBC, \"All exhibition can do is take Netflix at their word.\" \"In the deal they have pledged to continue to release legacy WB titles to theatres,\" the operator said. \"Now does that mean with a one-week window, a four-week window or no window? Netflix will have to diametrically alter their corporate philosophy of streaming first. We just have to wait to see. It's not great for exhibition.\"— CNBC's Alex Sherman and Stephen Desaulniers contributed to this report. Disclosure: Comcast is the parent company of Fandango and NBCUniversal, which owns CNBC. Versant would become the new parent company of Fandango and CNBC upon Comcast’s planned spinoff of Versant.",

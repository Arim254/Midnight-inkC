    "body": "In the U.S., postings for entry-level jobs have declined about 35% since January 2023, per data from labor research firm Revelio Labs.Cemile Bingol | Digitalvision Vectors | Getty ImagesAs more companies brazenly declare AI-driven layoffs in 2025, the first jobs on the chopping block appear to be junior positions and entry-level jobs.Graduate schemes and internships are at risk of becoming a thing of the past as major firms slash headcount in a push to deploy AI. Recently, Amazon laid off 14,000 corporate employees as it aims to invest in its \"biggest bets\" which includes generative AI.Other companies that are leaning on AI and cutting jobs include Accenture, Salesforce, Lufthansa and Duolingo.Now, concerns are mounting over whether AI can do the work of entry-level workers and graduates, thereby raising the barrier for entry.In fact, 62% of U.K. employers expect that junior, clerical, managerial and administrative roles will most likely be lost to AI, according to a new survey of 2,019 senior HR professionals and decision makers by the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development (CIPD.)And further data shows that the number of graduate roles available has declined in the past year. In the U.S., postings for entry-level jobs have declined about 35% since January 2023, per data from labor research firm Revelio Labs.In the U.K., the Institute for Student Employers found in its annual Student Recruitment Survey that just under 17,000 graduate vacancies in the U.K. had received 1.2 million applications highlighting the intense competition and the limited positions available to young people.As companies cut back on hiring junior workers, Fabian Stephany, assistant professor of AI and work at Oxford Internet Institute, pointed out that recruiting entry-level workers is actually an \"investment\" in the future.Although they tend to make mistakes and require hands-on training, experts told CNBC why replacing junior workers with AI will actually backfire on companies in the long-term.'Leadership of the future'Healthy organizations cultivate their own talent and it's not feasible to hire for all positions externally, according to Chris Eldridge, UKI and North America CEO of tech recruitment firm Robert Walters\"If you remove too many junior roles, you can starve the internal talent pipeline,\" Eldridge said.\"Entry-level, junior-level roles are the breeding ground for the leadership of the future. I think if you overcut that junior layer, you will have a talent bottleneck at some point in the business that leads invariably to an increase in hiring costs.\"If a company doesn't have enough young talent, it will be forced to hire from the outside in the future and will create a \"talent doom cycle\" which will result in increased costs, salary inflation, and a dependency on the external talent market.\"I represent a talent consultancy, however, we would advise every organization to have several routes to talent in the market, and one of them is to create your own,\" Eldridge said.\"Also talent retention is very important through the training development and opportunities you can give people… but you're missing a significant aspect of growth if you shut down the pipeline on bringing junior or entry-level talent into an organization,\" he added.'Generational bridge'Companies that don't nurture young talent will eventually lose touch with consumers and mainstream culture, according to Oxford Internet Institute's Stephany.\"A firm is part of society, and if it doesn't reflect society adequately, it's very hard for me to imagine a business model or product that doesn't need this generational bridge…and young people bring in fresh ideas that bring a new perspective,\" Stephany said to CNBC Make It.Firms that fail to adapt and hire junior employees will become \"like an elderly homes company,\" Stephany said. \"It's like a company of soon to be retired people because… they might not have the edge and the vibe that you need to bring in a new product to the market.\"Eldridge agreed noting that there's a stereotype that all good ideas come from the top but \"a very healthy percentage of great ideas in the company come from people within their first two or three years in an organization because they see it with fresh eyes.\"An additional bonus of having young people in an organization is the opportunity for reverse mentoring, particularly as young people bring a crucial knowledge of technology, and losing that would be a \"genuine threat\" to organizations.\"If anything erodes that opportunity for mentorship both ways and that knowledge transfer both ways, it will drive down institutional knowledge or create institutional gaps,\" he said.Matthew Prince, co-founder and CEO of Cloudflare, told CNBC's \"Worldwide Exchange\" last week that the tech firm plans to hire 11,000 interns in the age of AI in order to upskill the next generation but also bring fresh new ideas.\"50-year-old CEOs like myself aren't going to be the ones to teach companies how to take advantage of AI. We need to learn from the next generation,\" Prince said.'Culture carriers'\"Tacit knowledge\" is an important element to keeping an organization healthy, according to Stephany. It refers to the implicit and unspoken information about a company's culture that colleagues' share.\"There are so many things that make a company work that are nowhere to be written down,\" he said. \"They emerge from the network of people, those people that sit sometimes in the cafeteria that say 'I've been with the company for 25 years, I can explain you what what's going on, why X has a problem with Y.\"That's the type of company wisdom of tacit knowledge that's a lubricant for the economic wellbeing of the company,\" he said.Robert Walters' Eldridge added that young people are sponges and \"absorb the best of a business\" including this type of tacit knowledge that can only be passed on through people.\"They're the culture carriers of the future as well so if you're not bringing that cohort in that what does that mean down the road in terms of culture?\"\"I think businesses rely on that upwards pressure, where you bring in a cohort of inexperienced people, they are hungry, they want to learn. They ask an awful lot to organizations, which sometimes test them and keeps a company on its toes. if you don't have that it could potentially end up being a detriment to the culture and to the performance of an organization,\" Eldridge added.",

    "body": "The exterior of the main entrance of Ford Motor's new world headquarters in Dearborn, Michigan.FordDEARBORN, Mich. — Ford Motor is swapping its 1950s \"Glass House\" headquarters for a new, modern industrial facility to promote collaboration and better appease thousands of employees who have returned to offices in recent years after remote working.The new 2.1-million-square-foot facility in Dearborn, Michigan, is ceremoniously opening Sunday, although construction is expected to continue into 2027.It replaces a 12-story, rectangular-shaped headquarters roughly three miles away in the city that is expected to be demolished. The new building marks Ford's sixth headquarters since its founding in 1903.Currently nicknamed \"The Hub,\" the new headquarters will consolidate thousands of employees and several prior locations under one — albeit very large — roof. It is eventually expected to be home to up to 4,000 executives and employees involved with daily business operations, design and product development.Ford Motor's new world headquarters in Dearborn, Michigan, will function as corporate offices as well as a design and product development center.FordFrom an operational basis, the new headquarters is roughly split evenly between design and industrial operations. Design includes massive studios with hidden courtyards and a large showroom. The other half is set to be used for general business operations such as executive offices and common work and meeting areas.There are very few actual offices outside of those for top executives, according to the company. The idea is for employees to be able to work as they choose in different areas, or \"neighborhoods,\" depending on what they're working on that day, officials said. Domain staking, where employees attempt to make a space their permanent workplace, will be discouraged, said Jennifer Kolstad, global design and brand director for Ford Land, the automaker's property management group.\"It's not just a building. This is a space that is a tool for our employees to be more productive, to be more collaborative, and really help deliver the Ford+ plan,\" said Jim Dobleske, Ford Land chair and CEO, during a tour of the building.The Ford+ plan was introduced by CEO Jim Farley as a turnaround and efficiency plan for the automaker in 2021.A coffee bar in Ford Motor's new world headquarters in Dearborn, Michigan.FordAs of the end of last year, Ford employed roughly 30,500 white-collar salaried workers in the U.S. The company continues to own or utilize other properties throughout the U.S., including large bases in Dearborn and surrounding areas.Many salaried employees are expected in offices at least four days a week, as of earlier this year, after many of them had a more loose hybrid office-home schedule following the end of the pandemic.\"We're inviting them back into a space that is a tool to help them do their best work. And that best work tends to come with collaboration with other teams,\" Dobleske said.Scratch kitchensSome of that collaboration is expected to occur over food.The new headquarters includes a 160,000-square-foot dining area with eight \"kitchen concepts\" that will feature rotating menus as well as take-home options such as pizza and $6 whole rotisserie chickens, decadent desserts and a juice bar complete with a herb garden.A worker takes out a batch of rotisserie chickens inside Ford Motor's new world headquarters on Nov. 10, 2025, in Dearborn, Michigan.Michael Wayland / CNBC\"We have guests coming in from all over the world, so we wanted to make sure we have designed our menus to kind of play homage to that diversity,\" said Grant Vella, executive chef for the new ]headquarters. \"We wanted to do something different, push the boundary of business dining.\"Outside of the kitchens and dining areas, vegetation and outdoor spaces are meant to make for a more walkable-friendly campus compared with the automaker's prior, largely street- and parking lot-locked facility.\"This headquarters is the cornerstone of our campus redevelopment, but there's been a tremendous amount of work that we have done throughout the campus to really connect it and make it much more walkable for our employees,\" Dobleske said, pointing to several facilities and areas, including a test track and 18-acre \"Horsepower Park,\" surrounding the building.An herb garden inside the dining and kitchen area of Ford Motor's new world headquarters on Nov. 10, 2025 in Dearborn, Michigan.Michael Wayland / CNBCInside the building are six courtyards, including a dual-level one at the center of the company's new design studios to allow designers to take products outside to view them outdoors in natural light. Those design courtyards are exclusive areas that can only be viewed by the surrounding, private studios.Most of the four-story building features outside natural light from the exterior glass walls as well as skylights and other windowed areas.Ford Motor's new world headquarters in Dearborn, Michigan, which will function as corporate offices as well as a design and product development center.FordHidden designsIn addition to making a more walkable exterior campus, Ford wants employees to use purposefully designed stairs rather than elevators and escalators that are the primary modes of transportation in its most-recent 12-story headquarters.Craig Dykers, founding partner of Norwegian architectural firm Snøhetta that worked on the building, said each staircase in the building, especially in its 14 different arrival areas, are prominent and meant to be inviting to use.\"Obviously people don't naturally want to climb a stair, so you have to design it very carefully so that people feel good about using the stair,\" he said. \"Part of the trick is that as you go up one flight, you don't necessarily see the next flight, so it's kind of a journey.\"Stairs inside the main lobby of the building are extremely wide and feature seating areas alongside the actual low-rise stairs. There's also a coffee bar on a large landing above the main lobby.Ford Bronco parts painted white in the American Road Lobby of the automaker's new world headquarters in Dearborn, Michigan.FordThe coffee bar overlooks a white artwork that features vehicle parts — one of many prominent pieces of art Ford purchased or has curated for the new facility. Others are photos or drawings of vehicles, while some are simply non-automotive artistic pieces.Inside the company's design operations are large studios with advanced clay milling machines, a spacious showroom that will operate as a modern design dome and a 64-foot screen showing virtual reviews and testing.What employees will not see much of is the company's logo, the well-known blue oval surrounding the \"Ford\" name. There will be a massive Ford blue oval logo on the outside of the building but not on its interior. Unless you look closely.On some exterior glass walls, such as the company's design operations, there's a glass pattern that features the ovals accompanied by hidden numbers that represent Ford patents.Ford's signature blue oval design can be seen in glass on the outside of its new world headquarters, in addition to numbers representing patents held by the company.FordFord declined to discuss the capital spent to build its new headquarters and design center, which was part of a previously announced $1 billion campus transformation that began under former CEO Jim Hackett, who previously led furniture company Steelcase.Here's a look inside the new world headquarters:Workers prepare to raise a large Ford Motor blue oval onto the company's new headquarters on Nov. 10, 2025 in Dearborn, Michigan.

    "body": "The earlier you invest, the more time your money has to grow. But figuring out the exact accounts to use can feel overwhelming.After setting aside money to cover daily expenses in a checking account and three to 12 months of expenses in a savings account, you should start looking into putting any additional income into three different investment \"buckets,\" says Jaime Bosse, a certified financial planner and senior advisor at CGN Advisors in Manhattan, Kansas.\"If you have too much in cash, you're actually losing money to inflation,\" Bosse says. \"Any extra dollars you have should be invested in growing for the future.\"With three investment accounts, you'll have more flexibility to tap your money when you need it and more control over your tax bill now and later because each \"bucket\" offers different benefits, Bosse says. How to best allocate your money across the different types of accounts will vary based on your income and situation, she says, but the bottom line is you should be using them to your advantage. Be sure to speak with a trusted financial professional for individualized advice.Here are the three buckets she suggests and how they work.1. Tax-deferred bucketExamples: Traditional IRA, 401(k), 403(b)Tax-deferred accounts, like a traditional 401(k) or individual retirement account, let you contribute pre-tax money from your paycheck into an investment account. This lowers your taxable income for the year you contributed, and your investments grow tax-deferred until retirement.Withdrawals are taxed as income and usually penalty-free starting at age 59½. Taking money out earlier may trigger taxes and a 10% early withdrawal penalty.2. Tax-free bucketExamples: Roth IRA, Roth 401(k), Roth 403(b)You contribute money you've already paid taxes on to Roth accounts. Your investments then grow tax-free, and once you reach 59½, qualified withdrawals aren't taxed or penalized. Roth IRAs, in particular, also add flexibility by allowing you to withdraw money you've contributed at any time without penalty.These accounts are ideal if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in the future or want tax-free income later on, Bosse says.3. Taxable bucketExample: brokerage accountsTaxable brokerage accounts let you invest money after taxes and withdraw at any time without penalty. While you'll generally owe taxes on any realized gains, these accounts offer maximum flexibility for expenses outside of retirement, like a down payment on a house or a vacation, because you can access your money whenever you need it, Bosse says.Start by taking advantage of your company matchYou don't have to open all three accounts at once, says Patrick Huey, certified financial planner and owner of Victory Independent Planning in Portland, Oregon.Start by checking to see if your employer has a company match program where they will contribute an additional amount to your retirement accounts that matches your own contributions.Early in your career, Huey suggests contributing to a Roth 401(k) or Roth 403(b) instead of a tax-deferred 401(k) because you'll likely earn a higher salary as you get older — making it smarter to pay taxes now when you're in a lower tax bracket.However, even if it is through a tax-deferred account, \"if there's a match available, you should do what it takes to get it,\" because it's free money from your employer that boosts your retirement savings, Huey says.Using all three investment 'buckets' gives you optionsGenerally, experts recommend saving around 15% of your annual income before taxes for retirement, including any company match.Bosse says the purpose of splitting your money into three accounts is to give yourself options, whether it's to make big purchases, lower your current tax bill or reduce what you'll owe in the future.\"I would think of it in terms of not investing for your retirement, but investing for your future flexibility,\" Bosse says. When you have money in your three buckets, \"You can be working because you want to, not because you need to. You can travel the world. You can do other things.\"Want to level up your AI skills? Sign up for Smarter by CNBC Make It's new online course, How To Use AI To Communicate Better At Work.

    "body": "Adriana Kugler testifies before a Senate Banking Committee hearing on her nomination to be a member of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, on Capitol Hill in Washington, U.S., June 21, 2023. Jonathan Ernst | ReutersFormer Federal Reserve Board Gov. Adriana Kugler last year broke the central bank's rules barring trading of individual stocks and executing financial transactions close to meetings where interest rates are set, actions that led up to her abrupt resignation, according to a report by the U.S. Office of Government Ethics released Saturday.The report comes three months after Kugler mysteriously left from the Fed's Board of Governors without giving a reason. Kugler joined the Fed in September 2023 after being appointed by then-President Joe Biden.Kugler's resignation came after she requested and was denied a waiver by Chair Jerome Powell on a disclosure form that showed she had impermissible holdings, Fed officials familiar with the matter told CNBC.com.An official said that concerns related to trading activity by Kugler or her husband date to at least September 2024, when she began working with ethics officials to resolve violations of trading policies.A financial disclosure report that Kugler filed with the OGE this year on Sept. 11 — which contains details of securities transactions by either her or her husband — notes that an Ethics Office official declined to certify the report.In a note on Friday's disclosure, an Ethics official says, \"Matters related to this disclosure were referred earlier this year\" by the office to the independent Office of Inspector General for the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. An inspector general is an internal ethics watchdog for federal departments and agencies.Another note on the report says, \"Consistent with her September 15, 2024, disclosure, certain trading activity was carried out by Dr. Kugler's spouse, without Dr. Kugler's knowledge and she affirms that her spouse did not intend to violate any rules or policies.\"Troubles with tradesKugler is married to Ignacio Donoso, who is an immigration lawyer.Her disclosure shows two kinds of violations of Fed rules regarding financial transactions by senior officials at the central bank: purchases of stock shares of individual companies, as opposed to mutual funds; and purchases of securities during so-called \"blackout periods\" leading up to and after meetings of the Federal Open Market Committee.The FOMC meetings set key interest rates. Speculation about those meetings and their actual outcome can significantly affect the prices of stocks and bonds.Kugler's violations were related to purchases of stock in companies including Apple, Southwest Airlines, Caterpillar and Cava Group, the report indicates.Kugler participated in FOMC meetings during her tenure at the Fed. But she missed the FOMC's meeting this past July due to what the Fed had publicly said was a personal matter.Shortly before the July meeting, Kugler requested a waiver of the Ethics disclosure filing deadline to address the issue of impermissible holdings within her investment portfolio, according to Fed officials who spoke with CNBC.Two months earlier, she had asked for and received a standard extension for filing annual ethics disclosures, officials said.Powell, given the repeated efforts to deal with Kugler's issues, denied her request for another waiver, which led to her not participating in the FOMC meeting in July.Shortly afterward, on Aug. 1, Kugler announced her intention to resign on Aug. 8In another disclosure filed in October 2024, Kugler likewise pointed a finger at her husband Donoso for four stock purchases — three of Apple shares in July that year, and one of Cava shares that September — which violated Fed trading rules.\"These four purchases were carried out by my spouse, without my knowledge, and I affirm that my spouse did not intend to violate any rules,\" Kugler said at the time.\"Upon learning about the purchases, I immediately notified ethics officials, and at their direction, I initiated divestiture of these assets as soon as possible under FOMC ethics policies.\"CNBC has reached out to Kugler for comment on the new Ethics disclosure report, which also discloses that Kugler received more than $41,000 worth of \"pro bono legal services\" from the law firm Arnold & Porter.Pro bono means for free.CNBC has also requested comment from Donoso.Rule changesAfter she resigned from the Fed, Kugler returned to Georgetown University in Washington, D.C., where she is a professor at the McCourt School of Public Policy and Economics.In early 2022, the Fed adopted new rules that banned officials from trading in individual stocks and bonds, as well as cryptocurrencies.That move came after revelations that then-regional Fed presidents Eric Rosengren of Boston and Robert Kaplan of Dallas traded stocks and stock funds shortly before the central bank adopted broad measures to support the U.S. economy during the first weeks of the Covid-19 pandemic.Rosengren and Kaplan were cleared of any legal wrongdoing, but both of them left their positions amid questions about the propriety of Fed officials possibly using privileged information for financial gain. Other trades from Fed officials, including Powell, also faced scrutiny and drew intense criticism from the public and on Capitol Hill.Kugler's surprise resignation allowed President Donald Trump to appoint Stephen Miran to replace her for the remainder of her term on the Fed Board of Governors.Miran, whose current term ends on Jan. 31, took an unpaid leave of absence as chair of the White House Council of Economic Advisors.In 2024, the Fed's inspector general found that Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic, who is retiring in February, violated trading rules.",

    "body": "NASA astronaut Anne McClain is helped out of the SpaceX Dragon Endurance spacecraft onboard the SpaceX recovery ship SHANNON after she, NASA astronaut Nichole Ayers, JAXA (Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency) astronaut Takuya Onishi, and Roscosmos cosmonaut Kirill Peskov landed in the Pacific Ocean on August 9, 2025 off the coast of San Diego, California. Nasa | Getty ImagesA former Air Force intelligence officer has pleaded guilty to lying to a federal agent by falsely claiming that her estranged astronaut wife illegally accessed her bank account while aboard the International Space Station for six months, prosecutors in Houston, Texas, said Friday.The guilty plea by Summer Worden, 50, on Thursday comes more than five years after she was indicted in the space case for lying about actions by her wife, Anne McClain, a U.S. Army colonel, West Point graduate and Iraq war combat veteran, while they were in the midst of a divorce.The claim came at a time when Worden said that the couple was engaged in a custody battle over what Worden's then-6-year-old son, who had been conceived through in vitro fertilization and carried by a surrogate.Worden's trial in the case was scheduled to begin next Monday in Houston federal court.The Kansas resident was accused of making false statements about McClain to NASA's Office of Inspector General and the Federal Trade Commission, where she alleged that McCain had committed identity theft.Worden in July \"alleged her estranged spouse had guessed the password and illegally accessed her bank account while the spouse was deployed to the International Space Station,\" the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Texas said in a statement headlined \"Far Out\" on Friday.Read more CNBC politics coverageU.S. and Switzerland reach trade deal to lower tariffs to 15%Goldman Sachs stands by top lawyer after her emails with Jeffrey Epstein exposedGovernment shutdown back pay headed to federal workers in coming daysJeffrey Epstein files: House speaker announces vote next week on release of docsSupreme Court to hear arguments on Trump bid to fire Fed Gov. Lisa Cook on Jan. 21\"However, Worden had actually opened the account in April 2018,\" the office said. \"Both parties had accessed it until January 2019 when Worden changed the credentials.\"\"The investigation revealed Worden had granted her spouse access to her bank records from at least 2015, including her login credentials,\" the statement said. At the time of the alleged illegal access, McClain was preparing for what NASA billed as the first all-female space walk, which was later scrapped because the agency did not have enough spacesuits to fit the astronauts.McClain's attorney told The New York Times in 2019 that she had checked the account to monitor the family's finances, and that she had never been told by Worden that she could not have access to the account.McClain was aboard the Space Station from December 2018 through June 2019.She recently commanded the SpaceX Crew-10 crew mission to the Space Station from March this year until August.Worden, who remains free on bond, is scheduled to be sentenced on Feb. 12.She faces a maximum possible sentence of up to five years in prison.CNBC has requested comment from attorneys for Worden and McClain.",

    "body": "Ask anyone what they think keeps a relationship strong, and they will probably tell you it's love. There's some truth to that: love is what draws us together in the first place.But after years of studying couples as a psychologist, and as a husband, I've realized something that research keeps confirming: The real factor that keeps couples together, long after the honeymoon phase fades, is compromise.Love alone isn't enoughPsychologists define love as an emotion. And like all emotions, love fluctuates with stress, sleep, health, and the thousand of other factors that shape our daily lives.So you can love your partner deeply and still get annoyed, frustrated, or angry with them. Love won't shield you from conflict, nor will it solve your disagreements.That's why even the happiest couples argue and have rough patches, regardless of how much love they have for each other. The difference is that strong couples know love can't fix everything — but compromise can.The psychology of compromiseCompromise happens when you balance what you want, what your partner wants, and what's best for the relationship itself.Every couple brings together a set of habits, values, and experiences. Expecting perfect alignment is unrealistic. Instead, healthy couples learn to negotiate their reality. They turn \"my way\" and \"your way\" into \"our way.\"But compromise only works when it's rooted in a strong sense of we.Research shows that couples who describe their conflicts using \"we\" language (we decided, we talked, we figured it out) feel more connected and satisfied after disagreements. When both partners see compromise as a shared effort, not a loss, it strengthens the bond between them.What compromise looks like in real lifeCompromise doesn't always look romantic. Sometimes it means agreeing to watch a movie you'd never choose yourself. Other times, it means listening to your partner vent about something while resisting your desperate urge to offer solutions.In my own marriage, I've learned that a relationship rarely demands massive sacrifices. Instead, you'll be presented with the choice of whether or not you're willing to meet your partner halfway.Today, it might be who takes on which chores. Tomorrow, it might be about how you spend your evening together. Next month, it might be about how you navigate your family holidays. It might involve finding middle ground, taking turns, or agreeing to something else that neither of you had considered. What matters is that you're both heard and respected, and that no one feels that they have to \"win\" or \"be right.\" When you consistently make enough space for one another's needs, you'll build something that love alone rarely does: reliability.

    "body": "If you want to raise successful, resilient kids, help them find activities they actually like, says psychologist Angela Duckworth.Instead of forcing your children to try a specific sport or instrument, spend time exposing them to a variety of extracurriculars and take note of what they spend the most time thinking about, Duckworth said on an Oct. 13 episode of \"The Mel Robbins Podcast.\"Guiding kids to activities they're interested in can help them find their passions, hobbies and maybe even their future careers, said Duckworth, a psychology professor at the University of Pennsylvania who researches mental and emotional \"grit.\"\"I think great parenting, a lot of it is noticing what your young people is thinking about,\" Duckworth said, adding: \"When we begin to notice where our mind lives, when we begin to notice what attracts our attention spontaneously, that is the beginning of discovering the interests that can make us something of a genius about what we do.\"DON'T MISS: The ultimate guide to using AI to communicate betterKids who learn to stick with their interests, even on difficult days, can develop their confidence and resilience — two traits that can help them find success later in life, said Duckworth. Your child might pick a sport or hobby and then decide they don't like it, but it's important for them to finish that athletic season, or keep rehearsing that musical instrument just through their next concert, she added.Duckworth referenced her own experience as a parent. Her child Lucy \"hated doing homework and practicing her viola,\" but when Duckworth looked at Lucy's iPad, she noticed that \"all of the tabs were open to baking videos,\" she said. Duckworth also saw Lucy reading their family's cookbooks, she noted.Lucy ended up \"volunteering in restaurants washing dishes, [then] was allowed to assist the pastry chef,\" Duckworth tells CNBC Make It. \"She was doing pastry literally every weekend and every summer all the way from 8th grade to, I guess, 12th grade ... Her lifelong interest in food and cooking is still evident.\"Not every interest has to become a full-fledged career. If you just follow what you like to do, you might not necessarily make much money, bestselling author and New York University marketing professor Scott Galloway told CNBC Make It in 2019.\"Don't follow your passion,\" Galloway said. His advice instead: \"Find out what you're good at and then invest 10,000 hours in it — and become great at it.\"For Duckworth, interest is just one of four building blocks on the path to building grit, which her research shows is the most common characteristic among successful people in any field. The others include hard work, purpose and hope.\"Anybody who becomes great at what they do, there is a curiosity there, right? Their mind comes to this subject and wants to stay there,\" Duckworth said. \"When you start talking about something that you really care about, you're a genius [on it], because that is where your mind lives.\"Want to level up your AI skills? Sign up for Smarter by CNBC Make It's new online course, How To Use AI To Communicate Better At Work.

    "body": "Nikolas Kokovlis | Nurphoto | Getty ImagesAlphabet and Disney on Friday announced that they've reached a deal to restore content from ABC and ESPN onto Google's YouTube TV.The deal comes after a two-week standoff between the two companies that started on Oct. 31. The stalemate resulted in numerous live sporting events, including college football games and two Monday Night Football games, being absent from the popular streaming service.\"We're happy to share that we've reached an agreement with Disney that preserves the value of our service for our subscribers and future flexibility in our offers,\" YouTube said in a statement. \"Subscribers should see channels including ABC, ESPN and FX returning to their service over the course of the day, as well as any recordings that were previously in their Library. We apologize for the disruption and appreciate our subscribers' patience as we negotiated on their behalf.\"Disney Entertainment's co-chairs Alan Bergman and Dana Walden, along with ESPN Chairman Jimmy Pitaro, said in a statement that said the agreement reflects \"how audiences choose to watch\" entertainment.\"We are pleased that our networks have been restored in time for fans to enjoy the many great programming options this weekend, including college football,\" they said.More than 20 Disney-owned channels were removed from YouTube TV, which offered its subscribers $20 credits this week due to the dispute. In addition to ABC and ESPN, other networks that were unavailable included FX, NatGeo, Disney Channel and Freeform. The main sticking point between the two companies was the rate Disney charges YouTube TV for its networks. Disney's most valuable channel, ESPN, charges carriage of more than $10 a month per pay-TV subscriber, a higher fee than any other network in the U.S., CNBC previously reported.It's not the first conflict this year between YouTube and legacy media.NBCUniversal content was nearly removed from YouTube TV before the companies reached an agreement in October, preventing shows like \"Sunday Night Football\" and \"America's Got Talent\" from being pulled.YouTube TV also found itself in a standoff with Fox in August that almost resulted in Fox News, Fox Sports and other Fox channels going dark on the service just before the start of the college football season. The two sides were able to strike a deal to prevent a blackout.YouTube said it has the option for future program packages with Disney and other partners.Disney said that access to a selection of live and on-demand programming from ESPN Unlimited, which includes content from ESPN+ and new content on its all-inclusive digital service coming later this year, will be available on YouTube TV to base plan subscribers at no additional cost by the end of 2026.Here's the memo that Disney executives sent to employees:Team,We're pleased to share that we've reached a new agreement with YouTube TV, and all of our stations and networks are in the process of being restored to the service.While this was a challenging moment, it ultimately led to a strong outcome for both consumers and for our company, with a deal that recognizes the tremendous value of the high-quality entertainment, sports, and news that fans have come to expect from Disney.Over the past few years, we've led the way in creating innovative deals with key partners –each one unique, and each designed to recognize the full value of our programming. This new agreement reflects that same creativity and commitment to doing what's best for both our audiences and our business.We're proud of the work that went into this deal and grateful to everyone who helped make it happen — especially Sean Breen, Jimmy Zasowski, and the Platform Distribution team for their tireless commitment throughout this process.Thank you all for your patience and professionalism over the past several weeks. As you all know, the media landscape continues to evolve quickly, which makes these types of negotiations complex. What hasn't changed is our focus on the viewer. Our priority is — and will always be — delivering the best experiences and the best value to fans, and we'll continue working closely with our partners to ensure we're fulfilling that mission for our audiences.We're incredibly optimistic about what's ahead and grateful to all of you for continuing to set the standard for entertainment around the world.Alan, Dana & JimmyDisclosure: Comcast is the parent company of NBCUniversal, which owns CNBC.

    "body": "Close-up of sign with logo on facade of Cooper Companies in Pleasanton, California, March 26, 2018. Smith Collection/gado | Archive Photos | Getty ImagesCompany: Cooper Companies (COO)Business: The Cooper Companies is a global medical device company. It operates in two business units: CooperVision and CooperSurgical. The CooperVision segment is involved in the contact lens industry, while the CooperSurgical segment is involved in the fertility and women's health care market through its diversified portfolio of products and services, including fertility products and services, medical devices, cryostorage (such as cord blood and cord tissue storage) and contraception. CooperVision's products include MyDay daily disposable, MyDay daily disposable toric, MyDay Energys, MyDay multifocal, Biofinity & Biofinity XR, Biofinity Energys. CooperSurgical's portfolio includes INSORB, Lone Star, and the Doppler Blood Flow Monitor. It also offers a suite of single-use cordless surgical retractors with an integrated multi-light-emitting diode (LED) light source and dual smoke evacuation channels, and single-use surgical suction devices with an integrated, cordless radial LED light source.Stock Market Value: $14.41 billion ($72.49 per share)Activist: Jana PartnersOwnership: n/aAverage Cost: n/aActivist Commentary: Jana is a very experienced activist investor founded in 2001 by Barry Rosenstein. They made their name taking deeply researched activist positions with well-conceived plans for long term value. Rosenstein called his activist strategy \"V cubed.\" The three \"Vs\" were: (i) Value: buying at the right price; (ii) Votes: knowing whether you have the votes before commencing a proxy fight; and (iii) Variety of ways to win: having more than one strategy to enhance value and exit an investment. Since 2008, they have gradually shifted that strategy to one which we characterize as the three \"Ss\": (i) Stock price – buying at the right price; (ii) Strategic activism – sale of company or spinoff of a business; and (iii) Star advisors/nominees – aligning with top industry executives to advise them and take board seats if necessary.What's happeningOn Oct. 20, Jana announced that they took a position in Cooper Cos. and plan to push for strategic alternatives, including a potential transaction to combine its contact lens unit with peers such as Bausch + Lomb.Behind the scenesCooper Cos. is a leading global medical device company operating through two segments: CooperVision and CooperSurgical. CooperVision (66% of revenue) is focused on the sale of contact lenses. CooperVision is the global leader by contact wearers and second in terms of market share (26%), competing against Johnson and Johnson (37%), Alcon (26%), and Bausch + Lomb (10%).The global soft contact lens market is estimated to be worth about $11 billion and is growing at 4% to 6% annually. The segment has numerous tailwinds including a steady shift into silicone hydrogel 1-day lenses (about 40% of consumers are still using non-daily lenses), global growth in contact users, and high barriers to entry for competitors. As such, this is a great business that generates EBITDA margins in the mid-30s.CooperSurgical (33% of revenue) is focused on women's health services, with 60% of its fiscal year 2024 revenue derived from office and surgical (Paragard IUDs, stem cell cryostorage, medical devices) and 40% from fertility (IVF consumables, equipment, genomic and donor services). Fertility treatment is a $2 billion global market, also expected to grow at a 4% to 6% pace annually.For most of its history, Cooper was a pureplay vision business, until they added CooperSurgical in the 90s. Initially, this was a small – arguably tax-motivated – add-on. However, the company began heavily investing in this segment in 2017 – spending over $3 billion on the segment since.The problem with this shift is pretty clear – Cooper is effectively siphoning off cash from a really good contact lens business and then reinvesting it in what most people would judge to be a less attractive business. This is evident in the company's declining returns on capital, with CooperSurgical now operating at lower margins than they did in 2017 despite these massive investments.A key factor behind this operational shift may be management changes. The company's CEO Albert White, who previously led CooperSurgical, assumed leadership shortly after this expansion began. This raises a larger question about the company's strategic focus, leading many to question why the leader of this company would not have expertise in its core business.These strategic missteps have been further compounded by near-term headwinds across both segments, some self-inflicted. For CooperVision, the company mismanaged market expectations for the rollout of its new daily lens product, MyDay Energys, which is now behind schedule.For CooperSurgical, its highest quality business, IVF, has slowed meaningfully, likely attributable to comments from President Donald Trump suggesting potential reimbursements for IVF costs, causing patients to delay treatment in anticipation of this potential coverage. As a result, top-line organic growth fell meaningfully below expectations to 2%, down from 7% the prior quarter, forcing Cooper to significantly lower its full-year guidance at its third-quarter earnings call, sending the company's share price down 12.85% the following day. Now, Cooper is trading at a 12-month forward P/E of 16.4x — a steep discount to its 10-year average of 23.1x.All of this has prompted Jana Partners to announce a top portfolio position in Cooper and plans to push for strategic alternatives, including a potential transaction to combine its contact lens unit with peers such as Bausch + Lomb. While a transaction of this nature would typically raise some antitrust concerns, this may actually be the opposite case here.First, a merger would not result in a market leader, as the combined market share of 36% would be just below market leader J&J's share of 37% and not too far ahead of Alcon's 26% share.Secondly, these businesses are highly complementary with minimal geographical and product overlap, suggesting a reduction in the likelihood of regulatory hurdles. Notably, Bausch + Lomb has not been shy about their potential interest and also sees no regulatory issues, as CEO Brent Saunders has publicly stated that a potential combination with Cooper would \"strengthen competition and create a more scaled company in the contact lens segment.\"But Bausch + Lomb is not the only potential acquirer. Companies like European eyewear manufacturer EssilorLuxottica could also have interest and with even less regulatory uncertainty.As for CooperSurgical, there would certainly be private equity interest, as evidenced by Blackstone and TPG nearing a deal to acquire peer Hologic. However, Cooper shareholders may realize more value from the company cleaning up this portfolio internally – focusing more on the higher-multiple IVF business, shedding certain non-core assets, and potentially putting in new operators to execute a strong turnaround.Overall, with short-term headwinds likely to ease, Cooper has multiple avenues to recover its discount and open itself up for a potential rerating. Jana's thesis is straightforward: these two businesses make no sense under the same roof and a strategic combination for the vision business could yield $300 million to 500 million synergies, which is a lot for a business with $850 million in EBITDA. But step one in their plan is convincing management that separating the two businesses is the right strategic move; and despite growing public attention, there is no guarantee that management, especially with this type of operating history, will agree.Should management resist, this campaign changes dramatically from a strategic thesis to a leadership/governance thesis, likely centered on appointing a new CEO with a deep background in the contact lens industry to refocus the company on its core, while still positioning it for a separation down the line.Jana is not outwardly calling for a management change and White may even be the best person to lead a standalone CooperSurgical business. But activism is about the power of the argument and Jana seems to make a persuasive one here. Let's hope for all involved that management sees it that way.Ken Squire is the founder and president of 13D Monitor, an institutional research service on shareholder activism, and the founder and portfolio manager of the 13D Activist Fund, a mutual fund that invests in a portfolio of activist investments.",

    "body": "At ThredUp's 600,000-square-foot warehouse in Suwanee, Georgia, roughly 40,000 pieces of used clothing are processed each day. The company's logistics network — four facilities across the U.S. — now rivals that of some fast-fashion giants.\"This is the largest garment-on-hanger system in the world,\" said Justin Pina, ThredUp's senior director of operations. \"We can hold more than 3.5 million items here.\"Secondhand shopping is booming. The global secondhand apparel market is expected to reach $367 billion by 2029, growing almost three times faster than the overall apparel market, according to GlobalData.President Donald Trump's tariffs were billed as a way to bring manufacturing back home. But the measures hit one of America's most import-dependent industries: fashion.About 97 percent of clothing sold in the U.S. is imported, mostly from China, Vietnam, Bangladesh and India, according to the American Apparel and Footwear Association.For years, Gen Z shoppers have been driving the rise of secondhand fashion, but now more Americans are catching on.\"When tariffs raise those costs, resale platforms suddenly look like the smart buy. This isn't just a fad,\" said Jasmine Enberg, co-CEO of Scalable. \"Tariffs are accelerating trends that were already reshaping the way Americans shop.\"For James Reinhart, ThredUp's CEO, the company is already seeing it play out.\"The business is free-cash-flow positive and growing double digits,\" said Reinhart. \"We feel really good about the economics, gross margins near 80% and operations built entirely within the U.S.\"ThredUp reported that revenue grew 34% year over year in the third quarter. The company also said it acquired more new customers in the quarter than at any other time in its history, with new buyer growth up 54% from the same period last year.\"If tariffs add 20% to 30% to retail prices, that's a huge advantage for resale,\" said Dylan Carden, research analyst at William Blair & Company. \"Pre-owned items aren't subject to those duties, so demand naturally shifts.\"Inside the ThredUp warehouse, where CNBC got a behind-the-scenes look. automation hums alongside human workers. AI systems photograph, categorize, and price thousands of garments per hour. For Reinhart, the technology is key to scaling resale like retail.\"AI has really accelerated adoption,\" said Reinhart. \"It's helping us improve discovery, styling, and personalization for buyers.\"That tech wave extends beyond ThredUp. Fashion-tech startups Phia, co-founded by Phoebe Gates and Sophia Kianni, is using AI to scan thousands of listings across retail and resale in seconds.\"The fact that we've driven millions in transaction volume shows how big this need is,\" Gates said. \"People want smarter, cheaper ways to shop.\"ThredUp is betting that domestic infrastructure, automation, and AI will keep it ahead of the curve, and that tariffs meant to revive U.S. manufacturing could end up powering a new kind of American fashion economy.\"The future of fashion will be more sustainable than it is today,\" said Reinhart. \"And secondhand will be at the center of it.\"Watch the video to learn more.",

Washington Convention Center on Oct. 28, 2025 in Washington, DC.Anna Moneymaker | Getty Images As a handful of the world's most valuable companies set out to spend $1 trillion over the next five years on data centers for artificial intelligence, one line item is on the minds of executives and investors: depreciation.In accounting, depreciation is the act of allocating the cost of a hard asset over the course of its expected useful life. It's an increasingly important concept in the tech industry, as companies predict how long the hundreds of thousands of Nvidia graphics processing units, or GPUs, they're purchasing will remain useful or retain their value.Infrastructure giants like Google, Oracle and Microsoft have said their servers could be useful for up to six years. But they could also depreciate much sooner. Microsoft said in its latest annual filing that its computer equipment lasts two to six years.That's a lot to consider for the investors and lenders financing the giant AI buildouts, because the longer equipment remains valuable, the more years a company can stretch out depreciation and the less it hurts profits.Read more CNBC reporting on AIThis Meta alum has spent 10 months leading OpenAI's nationwide hunt for its Stargate data centersAI Sam Altman and the Sora copyright gamble: 'I hope Nintendo doesn't sue us'Anthropic launches Claude Sonnet 4.5, its latest AI model that's 'more of a colleague'Sam Altman on worries about OpenAI’s $850 billion in planned buildouts: ‘I totally get that’AI GPUs represent a particular challenge because they're still relatively new to the market. Nvidia's first AI-focused processors for data centers came out around 2018. The current AI boom started with the launch of ChatGPT in late 2022. Since then, Nvidia's annual data center revenue has jumped from $15 billion to $115 billion in the fiscal year that ended in January.There's no real track record for how long GPUs last when compared with other types of heavy equipment that businesses have been using for decades, said Haim Zaltzman, vice chair of Latham & Watkins' emerging companies and growth practice.\"Is it three years, is it five, or is it seven?\" said Zaltzman, who works on GPU financings, in an interview. \"It's a huge difference in terms of how successful it is for financing purposes.\"Some of Nvidia's customers say AI chips will retain value for a long time and that customers will continue to pay for access to older processors because they'll still be useful for other tasks. CoreWeave, which buys GPUs and rents them out to clients, has used six-year depreciation cycles for its infrastructure since 2023.CoreWeave CEO Michael Intrator told CNBC this week, following quarterly earnings, that his company is being \"data driven\" about GPU shelf life.Intrator said that CoreWeave's Nvidia A100 chips, which were announced in 2020, are all fully booked. He also added that a batch of Nvidia H100 chips from 2022 became available because a contract expired, and they were immediately booked at 95% of their original price.\"All of the data points that I'm getting are telling me that the infrastructure retains value,\" Intrator said.CoreWeave CEO, Michael Intrator appears on CNBC on July 17, 2024. CNBCStill, CoreWeave shares plunged 16% after its earnings report as delays at a third-party data center developer hit full-year guidance. The stock is down 57% from its high reached in June, part of a broader sell-off reflecting concerns about overspending in AI. Oracle shares have plummeted 34% from their record high in September.Among the most vocal skeptics of the AI trade is short seller Michael Burry, who recently disclosed bets against Nvidia and Palantir.Burry this week suggested that companies including Meta, Oracle, Microsoft, Google and Amazon are overstating the useful life of their AI chips and understating depreciation. He pegs the actual useful life of server equipment at around two to three years, and said companies are inflating their earnings as a result.Amazon and Microsoft declined to comment. Meta, Google and Oracle did not respond to requests for comment.'You couldn't give Hoppers away'There are a number of ways AI chips could depreciate before six years. They could wear out and break, or they could become obsolete as newer GPUs are released. They could still be useful for running certain workloads, but with much worse economics.Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has implied as much. When Nvidia announced a new Blackwell chip earlier this year, he joked that the value of its predecessor, the Hopper, would deteriorate.\"When Blackwell starts shipping in volume, you couldn't give Hoppers away,\" Huang said in March at Nvidia's AI conference.\"There are circumstances where Hopper is fine,\" he continued. \"Not many.\"Nvidia now releases new AI chips on an annual basis, versus the two-year cadence it had before. Advanced Micro Devices, its closest GPU competitor, followed suit.Nvidia reports quarterly results next week.Amazon, in a February filing, said it decreased the useful life for a subset of its servers from six years to five years because it conducted a study that found \"an increased pace of technology development, particularly in the area of artificial intelligence and machine learning.\"Meanwhile, other hyperscalers are extending their GPU useful life estimates for newer server equipment.Microsoft Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Satya Nadella speaks during the Microsoft Build 2025, conference in Seattle, Washington, on May 19, 2025.Jason Redmond | AFP | Getty ImagesAlthough Microsoft plans to build AI infrastructure aggressively, CEO Satya Nadella said this week that his company is trying to space out its AI chip purchases and not overinvest in a single generation of processors. He added that the biggest competitor for any new Nvidia AI chip is its predecessor.\"One of the biggest learnings we had even with Nvidia is that their pace increased in terms of their migrations,\" Nadella said. \"That was a big factor. I didn't want to go get stuck with four or five years of depreciation on one generation.\"Nvidia declined to comment.Dustin Madsen, vice president of the Society of Depreciation Professionals and founder of Emrydia Consulting, said depreciation is a financial estimate by management and that developments in a fast-moving industry like technology can change initial predictions.Depreciation estimates, Madsen said, generally take into account assumptions such as technological obsolescence, maintenance, historical lifespans of similar equipment and internal engineering analysis.\"You're going to have to convince an auditor that what you're suggesting what its life will be is actually its life,\" Madsen said. \"They will look at all of those factors, like your engineering data that suggests that the life of these assets is approximately six years, and they will audit that at a very detailed level.\"-- CNBC's Jordan Novet contributed to this story.WATCH: Chris Wood: We've removed Nvidia from our portfolio, prefer China AI nameswatch now",

    "body": "People walk past a Prada storefront located in a modern shopping complex on January 26, 2025, in Chongqing, China.Cheng Xin | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesChinese shoppers are returning to luxury. Top executives from Prada, Coach, EssilorLuxottica and Value Retail told CNBC they're seeing demand in China stabilize after months of weakness, even as the broader luxury sector continues to report softer spending among Chinese consumers at home and overseas.China was on track to become the world's largest luxury market during the coronavirus pandemic, but the sector has slowed sharply since then. High youth unemployment, a prolonged property downturn and weaker household confidence have weighed on discretionary purchases, particularly among middle-income shoppers.Speaking to CNBC's Charlotte Reed at the JPMorgan Global Luxury and Brands Conference in Paris, France, executives said they are beginning to see a change in spending patterns. Andrea Bonini, chief financial officer of Prada Group, said the company is \"cautiously optimistic.\"\"We do see things stabilizing, indeed,\" Bonini told CNBC, adding that \"the structural trends in this industry are still there, and are still there in China as well.\"Prada's CFO said a more \"normalized\" backdrop may only emerge in 2026 after the sharp swings that followed the pandemic.watch nowCoach is also seeing strong momentum. CEO and brand president Todd Khan told CNBC: \"We had a fabulous quarter. Our China business grew by 20%,\" a trend he said has held for several quarters. Coach's positioning has helped attract a more cautious consumer, he said, adding: \"Our sweet spot in China, particularly if the consumer is more cautious, really resonates.\"The company is deepening its on-the-ground presence, with 25 years in the market, co-design studios in China, and expansion in regional hubs such as Wuhan. Coach has also been somewhat insulated from U.S. tariff exposure.\"So, 40% of our growth is international. So, for international, those U.S. tariffs that you're referencing have no impact,\" Khan said.Signs of growthRecent earnings support that view. UBS research shows Burberry's Greater China sales rose 3% last quarter, beating expectations for flat growth, while Richemont said sales to Chinese customers were \"almost flat\" — a sharp improvement from earlier double-digit declines. UBS added that Richemont delivered 10% APAC growth and saw improving momentum into year-end.LVMH, for its part, has pointed to early signs of stabilization. Last month, the luxury giant reported 1% growth in the third quarter — its first quarterly increase this year — with CFO Cécile Cabanis telling analysts that \"mainland China turned positive in Q3,\" according to Reuters.watch nowStill, analysts have warned against assuming a full rebound.Chiara Battistini, JPMorgan's head of European luxury, told CNBC it is \"early to call it a turnaround and a complete inflection,\" noting that the apparent improvement came against \"a particularly easy\" comparison base. Some of the uplift, she said, reflected spending being repatriated back into mainland China rather than a broad-based acceleration.The overall picture across the \"total Chinese consumer\" in Asia remained \"more mixed,\" Battistini said, with China's macro backdrop still \"quite complex.\"Brands race to localiseGlobal brands are being pushed to localize far more aggressively as competition from Chinese labels intensifies. As CNBC's Evelyn Cheng reported a few weeks ago, many are increasing China-focused marketing — in some cases to more than 40% of revenue, according to WPIC's Jacob Cooke — while speeding up product cycles and tailoring designs using local consumer data. The rise of social media platforms Xiaohongshu and Douyin has also forced companies to rethink content and product strategy.Read moreThe change is slowly trickling down to retailers and big luxury companies that are seeing modest growth from the region. Outlet operator Value Retail has seen solid traction. Chairman Scott Malkin said the company's China properties \"are going very well right now,\" noting that global brands had encouraged the company to expand into China to ensure the \"correct presentation of authentic surplus.\"Malkin said outlets continue to attract the \"aspirational buyer who will become a full-price customer again in a different moment.\"The same holds true for eyewear group EssilorLuxottica, that is reporting broad-based growth too. CFO Stefano Grassi said: \"We were double digit in North America, double digits in Europe, and double digits in Asia.\"\"We see consumer not trading down. We see consumers attracted by product innovation,\" Grassi said. Luxury bosses agree China is stabilizing, but not yet rebounding.watch nowWith brands reshaping strategy and analysts urging caution, the recovery remains a slow grind. Still, as Prada's Bonini said, the \"structural trends\" powering Chinese luxury haven't gone away — they're just taking longer to re-emerge.— CNBC's Christopher Kang contributed to this report.",

    "body": "Planes line up on the tarmac at LaGuardia Airport on November 10, 2025 in New York City. Spencer Platt | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesThe U.S. has been scrambling to hire more air traffic controllers for years. The longest-ever federal government shutdown might have made that even harder.\"We need more of them to come into the profession, and this shutdown is going to make that more difficult for us to accomplish that goal,\" Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said at a press conference at Chicago O'Hare International Airport on Tuesday, a day before Congress signed a bill to fund the federal government through January, ending the shutdown.Air traffic controllers were required to work without receiving regular paychecks during the shutdown. They were paid in part on Friday, according to people familiar with the matter, but during the shutdown some had taken second jobs to make ends meet, while the lack of regular pay added to their stress, union and government officials and lawmakers have said.The Federal Aviation Administration reported low-staffing thresholds were hit that that slowed aircraft around the country during the final days of the shutdown. President Donald Trump earlier this week threatened to dock air traffic controllers' pay if they didn't go to work. On Friday, staffing levels were relatively strong around the U.S. and disruptions eased.\"It can't make it look like this is a great job because you're going to have to deal with this all the time,\" said Tim Kiefer, who teaches air traffic management at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University in Prescott, Ariz.Kiefer was an air traffic controller for more than two decades before he retired. He said shutdowns or the threat of them were common during his career. \"You may see people decide to do other things and say, 'They didn't get paid; they were stuck in the middle of a partisan dispute,'\" he said.Read more CNBC airline newsAirlines warn flight cancellations will continue even after shutdown endsPrivate-jet demand is on the rise amid government shutdown, says Flexjet CEOBoeing stems cash burn for first time since 2023 but takes $4.9 billion charge on 777X delaysAmerican Airlines is late to the luxury travel boom. Can it catch up?5 million passengersThe shortage of air traffic controllers delayed or canceled thousands flights during the shutdown, affecting the travel plans of more than 5 million people, according to Airlines for America, an industry group that includes American Airlines, United Airlines, Delta Air Lines, Southwest Airlines and others.But even with partial pay hitting bank accounts, the staffing crisis that regularly upends travel is set to continue.A government tally last year showed the U.S. was short 3,903 fully certified air traffic controllers of a goal of 14,633. Shortages have been particularly severe at busy facilities like those where controllers guide planes in and out of airports in the congested New York area, adding to flight disruptions and frustrating airline executives and customers.watch nowMeanwhile, retirements picked up in the shutdown, with 15 to 20 people retiring per day, down from a usual rate of four a day, Duffy said Tuesday. Controllers are required to retire at age 56 but can do so earlier with benefits depending on years on the job.Staffing was already thin before the shutdown began on Oct. 1, and many controllers were working six-day workweeks. By mid-November, as air traffic controllers missed two full paychecks and the shutdown passed the one-month mark, it approached crisis levels.More than 10% of U.S. departures were canceled last Sunday as bad weather combined with air traffic controller shortfalls at facilities across the country. That was the highest rate since July 19, 2024, during the CrowdStrike outage, which had an outsize impact on Delta Air Lines, leading to thousands of canceled flights and causing travel headaches, according to aviation-data firm Cirium.Hours after those cancellations spiked on Sunday, the Senate advanced a preliminary deal that led to the vote ending the shutdown this week.The Federal Aviation Administration in early November ordered airlines to cut 4% of flights from their domestic schedules at 40 major airports, blaming safety risks they found because of an increased strain on air traffic controllers. Cuts were set to ramp up to 10% on Friday, if the shutdown didn't end. Cancellations, however, improved dramatically during the week and on Friday morning, just 2% of U.S. departures were canceled, according to Cirium.The FAA brought its mandated cuts down from 6% to 3% starting on Saturday, saying it will monitor system performance throughout the weekend.The disruptions were similar to those on days with severe storms, but were more widespread across the U.S.Millions in lost revenueThe last-minute cuts were a headache for the industry, where airlines from top-moneymaker Delta to struggling carrier Spirt had already lowered their outlooks for the year after an oversupply of flights and weaker-than-expected demand earlier this year. Airlines haven't yet quantified the damage from the shutdown, but Bank of America estimated a $150 million to $200 million operating income hit for big network airlines and less than $100 million for other carriers.Travelers walk through the terminal at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport, more than a month into the ongoing U.S. government shutdown, in Arlington, Virginia, U.S., Nov. 11, 2025. Annabelle Gordon | ReutersAirline executives, exasperated by the recent disruptions, are now pushing Congress to make sure controllers are paid in the next shutdown.\"In the past week, we saw a crescendo effect as air traffic control staffing shortages led to massive and unpredictable amounts of delays and cancellations across the industry — and that was on top of a series of FAA-mandated schedule reductions,\" American Airlines CEO Robert Isom and the carrier's chief operating officer, David Seymour, said in a note to employees on Thursday, a day after the House approved a short-term funding bill. \"While we both have been in this industry for a long time, only a few other events come to mind when we think about this level of disruption.\"It could have been worse. This part of the fall travel demand is relatively light, but Thanksgiving was fast approaching when Congress ended the shutdown, concerning airline executives.\"This shutdown put tremendous strain on our aviation system and caused severe inconvenience for the millions of Americans who depend on it,\" United said in a statement. \"It should be obvious to everyone that policy debates, however urgent, should never put air travel at risk, and we urge Congress to ensure that the FAA and [Transportation Security Administration's] funding is protected in the event of any future lapse in federal appropriations.\"'Political football'It wasn't the first time a government closure has put the aviation industry under strain. The 2018-2019 shutdown, then the longest in U.S. history, ended just hours after controller shortages snarled travel in the New York City area.Some airline executives told CNBC that they were frustrated by this most recent shutdown and last-minute schedule changes, which ended up being greater than anticipated. One, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he wasn't authorized to speak to the press, said \"we were the pawns\" in the shutdown.watch nowDelta CEO Ed Bastian told CNBC's \"Squawk on the Street\" on Wednesday that \"the thing we don't like is being a political football\" and said it was unacceptable that air traffic controllers and TSA officers were forced to work without regular paychecks.The best way to prevent such disruptions is \"to ensure those workers, the next time this happens because it will happen, get paid,\" Bastian said. \"Who could disagree with that?\"The airline industry is urging Congress for legislation that could make use of funds generated by airplane ticket taxes to ensure air traffic controllers and other essential industry workers like airport screeners and Customs agents are paid.\"You don't hold the American public hostage over a political fight like that,\" Airlines for America CEO Chris Sununu, the former governor of New Hampshire, said in a virtual press conference Wednesday, shortly before the House passed the funding bill.Travelers check their flight status at Dulles International airport as the nation's air travel system begins to return to normal, as the U.S. government opens back up following the longest shutdown in U.S. history, in Dulles, Virginia, U.S. Nov. 13, 2025. Evelyn Hockstein | ReutersNext Wednesday, Sen. Jerry Moran, R-Kan., who chairs the Commerce Subcommittee on Aviation, Space and Innovation, will hold a hearing on the shutdown's impact on aviation. Moran this year pushed for legislation that would let the FAA use the Airport and Airway Trust Fund, which is funded by taxes on airplane tickets and fuel, to cover expenses if the government shuts down.\"The government shutdown has severely impacted our already fragile aviation industry, and recovering from its effects will take time,\" he said in a release this week. \"It's critical that we address the damage done and look at the long-term effects of the shutdown.\"Lawmakers earlier this year approved $12.5 billion to improve air traffic control, though the industry said it needs billions more to modernize the system in the U.S.The fatal collision of an American Airlines regional jet and an Army Black Hawk helicopter in Washington, D.C., in January also made hiring controllers more urgent, especially at congested facilities.About a month after the crash, Duffy announced the country's air traffic controller academy would raise pay for students, and he authorized more universities to teach a similar curriculum to help ease the shortage. The academy in Oklahoma City also stayed open, a different tactic than in the 2018-2019 shutdown.But those aren't immediate fixes. It takes years for controllers to be fully trained to work at some of the more complex facilities, and applicants to the academy can be no older than 30.",

    "body": "As Warren Buffett gets closer to stepping down as CEO at the end of next month, he told shareholders he will be \"going quiet,\" but only \"sort of.\"More on his Thanksgiving letter, which looks like it could become a substantial annual tradition, below.First:A surprising stakeThere was a notable surprise in Berkshire Hathaway's end-of-Q3 equity portfolio snapshot, released after Friday's closing bell.Someone in Omaha purchased more than 17.8 million Class A shares of Google's parent, Alphabet.They are currently valued at $4.9 billion, making them the biggest Q3 addition in dollar terms.The news sent the stock 3.5% higher in after-hours trading.At this point, we don't know who made the call.Buffett has typically made purchases of this size, but it doesn't feel like his kind of stock.It is up 51.3% year-to-date, including a 37% climb in the third quarter.Also, he has traditionally shied away from tech stocks. (He considers Apple a consumer products company.)At the 2019 Berkshire meeting, Buffett and Charlie Munger lamented that they had \"screwed up\" by not buying Alphabet earlier because they \"could see in our own operations how well that Google advertising was working. And we just sat there sucking our thumbs.\"On that day, the shares were going for around $59, and they gave no indication there were prepared to rectify their error.Incoming CEO Greg Abel isn't encumbered by that history, and Buffett has been handing over many of his duties to him.Or it could be one or both of the portfolio managers, Ted Weschler and Todd Combs.Stay tuned.Not so surprising sellingAlphabet was by far the biggest Q3 addition at $4.3 billion, based on the September 30 price, well ahead of a $1.2 billion increase for Chubb.The biggest decreases, Apple and Bank of America, had been foreshadowed by hints in Berkshire's 10-Q almost two weeks ago.(The Verisign reduction was disclosed in early August.)Berkshire's Apple position was cut by almost 15%, or $10.6 billion, to around 238 million shares.It's down 74% since Berkshire began selling two years ago.But Apple remains Berkshire's largest equity position at $64.9 billion, which is 21% of the portfolio's current value.The Bank of America reduction was smaller, just 6.1%, or around $1.9 billion.The remaining 568 million shares are currently valued at $29.9 billion, Berkshire's third largest position, making up almost 10% of the portfolio's current value.It's been cut by 43% since early last year.A complete listing of Berkshire's Q3 13F appears below. 'Sort of'Many of the headlines on news stories about Warren Buffett's Thanksgiving letter on Monday included this quotation: \"I'm 'going quiet.'\"But there was another phrase that followed that line near the top of the letter, getting its own paragraph: \"Sort of.\"Warren Buffett speaks during the Berkshire Hathaway Annual Shareholders Meeting in Omaha, Nebraska on May 3, 2025.CNBCStarting next year, Greg Abel, \"a great manager, a tireless worker and an honest communicator,\" will be writing the annual meeting to shareholders and answering questions at the annual meeting. Buffett plans to sit on the arena floor with the other directors.But he wrote, \"I will continue talking to you and my children about Berkshire via my annual Thanksgiving message.\"This year's letter ran a bit more than seven pages, compared to around three pages last year, and sounded a lot like the annual letters he's been writing for decades, with sections on the importance of luck, getting old, his admiration for Berkshire shareholders, the many friends he has made over the years in Omaha, and his complete confidence in Abel's ability to run the company.He also revealed that while hospitalized as a child, he received a fingerprint kit and proceeded to take prints from the nuns caring for him, because \"someday a nun would go bad, and the FBI would find that they had neglected to fingerprint nuns.\"(CNBC.com has this summary)The newsiest bit was his plan to \"step up the pace of lifetime gifts\" to the three foundations run by his children, who, like Buffett, are getting older. (They are 72,70, and 67.)He wants to \"improve the probability that they will dispose of what will essentially be my entire estate before alternate trustees replace them.\"But he also \"wants to keep a significant amount of 'A' shares until Berkshire shareholders develop the comfort with Greg that Charlie and I long enjoyed.\"The result, at least for this year, is an increase in the Class B shares (converted from Class A) going to each foundation to 400,000 shares from 300,000 shares last year.Including a fourth unchanged donation to a foundation named after his late wife, the total as of the date of the gifts increased 17% to $1.3 billion.Playing a more minor role: Class B shares are up 4% since last year's gifts.The entire U.S portfolio as of September 30BUFFETT AROUND THE INTERNETBERKSHIRE STOCK WATCHFour weeksTwelve monthsBERKSHIRE'S TOP U.S. HOLDINGS - Nov. 14, 2025Berkshire's top holdings of disclosed publicly traded stocks in the U.S., Japan, and Hong Kong, by market value, based on today's closing prices.Holdings are as of September 30, 2025 as reported in Berkshire Hathaway's 13F filing on November 14, 2025, except for:Itochu, which is as of March 17, 2025, and Mitsubishi, which is as of August 28, 2025.

    "body": "President Donald Trump is blaming the meat packers and U.S. cattlemen for rising beef prices, but the tariffs on beef from Brazil, Australia, New Zealand, Uruguay, feed, farm equipment and machinery are all adding to the price surge.The United States is a big buyer of Australian, Brazilian, and New Zealand beef exports.Brazil is the second-largest beef-producing country and the largest beef-exporting country in the world.Brazilian beef exports tracked by Panjiva plummeted in July and August after multiple tariffs resulted in a layered 76.4% total rate being implemented for Brazilian beef. Trump imposed a 50% tariff rate for many Brazilian goods in July. Beef exports have found a new home, being diverted to other markets like China.Exports of beef from Australia, New Zealand and Uruguay to the U.S. have also decreased as a result of tariffs.The pullback in exports has reduced supply and is adding to pressures in an already tight U.S. beef supply chain.\"When you impose an extra 50% tariff on a major supplier like Brazil, importers may keep buying and pass costs along, or they may stop buying, but that means less supply to meet the demand,\" said Dan Anthony, president of economic research firm Trade Partnership Worldwide. \"Either way, you expect prices to go up, especially when imports from Australia, New Zealand, Uruguay, and other key suppliers face new tariffs too,\" he added.The most recent consumer price index report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics for the month of September showed prices for a variety of uncooked beef products rising year over year between 12% and 18%.The compounding effect of tariffs comes at a time when the U.S. cattle herd is at near a 75-year low, and consumer demand for beef has grown.Beef cattle in a pasture at a ranch in Sonoita, Arizona, US, on Tuesday, Nov. 11, 2025. Bloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesCattle ranchers have had difficulties increasing the herd because of drought, which has diminished the amount of grasslands to feed their herds, and the higher costs in buying feed. Some imported fertilizers have faced double-digit tariffs, which have raised the cost of growing the crops (corn, soybeans) that are used in animal feed.Tariffs on essential items like steel and aluminum have also increased the cost of farm equipment (tractors, grain bins) and repairs.All of these added expenses carve out money from the coffers of ranchers and farmers that would be used for investing back into their operations.\"We're in one of the toughest cattle cycles in history,\" said sixth-generation Texas rancher James Clement III. \"We have the smallest pipeline of future cattle and even with today's prices, ranchers can't speed up the process to rebuild the national herd, which will take time, grass, and rain,\" he said.Replacement heifers are down to a 20-year low.Ranchers say it takes years to see a return on buying heifers.\"The fundamentals are tight, the runway is long, and the slightest shock makes an already fragile rebuild even harder,\" Clement said. \"This is a foreign concept to many other industries where production can be ramped up or down in weeks,\" he added.One of the biggest headwinds curtailing investment is the current political environment.\"Producers start second-guessing whether to hold back heifers or take the money today because uncertainty adds risk to ranchers wanting to retain or purchase heifers to rebuild their herds,\" Clement said.President Trump added to frustration among ranchers when he announced as part of a deal with Argentina in October having the country export beef into the United States to help lower beef prices, which the National Cattlemen's Beef Association said would harm rural America and do nothing to help solve the issues in the domestic cattle market. The president's plan helped sink the price of cattle futures.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconLive cattle futures trading chart year-to-date 2025 through November 13.\"We don't need Argentine beef because the U.S. already produces more high-quality beef than ever before,\" Clement said. \"The expanded Argentine quota entering our market, it would amount to less than half of one percent, about one extra hamburger per person, nowhere near enough to move the needle,\" he said.The U.S. Department of Agriculture recently acknowledged the dwindling herd numbers and announced a series of initiatives it hopes will encourage people to become cattlemen.The White House has become more focused on its affordability messaging in recent days after key GOP election losses around the country. The Trump administration announced trade deals on Thursday intended to help lower prices on some grocery staples not grown in the U.S., including from coffee and banana-producing countries Ecuador and Guatemala, and additional tariff reductions covering beef imports on Friday. \"It's politically easy to slap tariffs on foreign competitors to defend domestic producers but the consumer usually ends up paying the cost,\" said Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer of OnePoint BFG Wealth Partners. \"Demand then shrinks, they eat chicken instead and the domestic producers end up no better off,\" he said.While there are many ranchers sitting on the sidelines waiting for better economic conditions and incentives to grow their herds, Clement is investing in his ranch and is continuing to buy heifers to grow his operation.\"Cattle are a great long-term investment and ranching is a great life,\" he said.In addition to climate and feed costs, U.S. cattle ranchers are concerned about the possible return of the New World Screwworm. U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins led the largest USDA trade mission to Mexico to discuss measures for combating NWS.The parasitic fly lays eggs in the open wounds of warm-blooded animals. The larvae then hatches from the eggs and burrows into tissue of animals to feed on them. If caught early, the sick animal can be treated and survive. Human cases are rare but can be painful and require medical attention. This parasite was successfully eradicated from the United States in 1966, but some cattle in Mexico have been found infected with the parasite and all Mexican beef imports have been shuttered.All of these supply chain challenges have added to the pressure on beef prices.\"We will adapt to market changes and New World Screwworm as ranchers have always done, by staying steady and calm in the face of all of the challenges that ranchers have always faced,\" Clement said.",

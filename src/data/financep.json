    "body": "Home prices are expected to rise by about 2.2% nationally in 2026, but some large U.S. cities — mostly in the Midwest and Northeast — could see prices climb much faster.That's according to a recent Realtor.com forecast, which projects \"a more balanced\" housing market as higher inventory slows overall price growth. Even so, the moderation isn't expected to be evenly felt.\"The Midwest and Northeast have maintained strong demand despite the broader slowdown, largely due to persistent inventory scarcity,\" Hannah Jones, senior economic research analyst at Realtor.com, tells CNBC Make It.While many markets in the South and West are seeing price growth flatten or turn negative as new construction adds supply, cities in the Midwest and Northeast have added fewer homes in recent years, which has helped kept prices moving higher, according to Realtor.com.Here are the 11 large U.S. cities expected to see the biggest home-price increases in 2026:1. Toledo, OhioExpected 2026 price growth: 13.1%Median home price: $199,9002. Syracuse, New YorkExpected 2026 price growth: 12.4%Median home price: $298,9503. Scranton–Wilkes-Barre–Hazleton, PennsylvaniaExpected 2026 price growth: 10.9%Median home price: $260,0004. Rochester, New YorkExpected 2026 price growth: 10.3%Median home price: $256,9005. Hartford–West Hartford–East Hartford, ConnecticutExpected 2026 price growth: 9.5%Median home price: $429,0006. Baltimore–Columbia–Towson, MarylandExpected 2026 price growth: 8.3%Median home price: $375,0007. New Haven–Milford, ConnecticutExpected 2026 price growth: 7.7%Median home price: $439,0008. Winston-Salem, North CarolinaExpected 2026 price growth: 7.7%Median home price: $342,8999. Albany–Schenectady–Troy, New YorkExpected 2026 price growth: 7.5%Median home price: $419,90010. Columbia, South CarolinaExpected 2026 price growth: 7.2%Median home price: $303,30011. Milwaukee–Waukesha–West Allis, WisconsinExpected 2026 price growth: 7%Median home price: $379,000Realtor.com's metro-level forecasts are based on its own listings data, along with local inventory levels, new construction activity, employment and income trends, and mortgage rate expectations.What those projections show is that in markets where very little housing has been added, even modest demand is enough to keep prices rising — especially in smaller Midwest and Northeast cities. By contrast, in markets where construction has been heavier, home prices in some areas are expected to fall by as much as 10% in 2026.The metros with the highest expected gains \"have seen very limited new housing development, keeping supply tight,\" says Jones. At the same time, most of these cities have home prices \"well below national averages,\" she says.Overall, only three of the 11 cities on the list have median listing prices above the U.S. median of about $415,000 as of late 2025.Toledo stands out in particular for its relative affordability. The city's median home price of about $199,900 is well below Ohio's statewide median of roughly $275,000, per Realtor's data.Another factor is proximity to larger urban hubs. \"In the Northeast, demand has remained elevated as buyers seek more affordable, commutable alternatives to large, high-cost metros, such as New York and Boston,\" says Jones. \"Because new construction has lagged in many of these older, built-out Northeastern markets, supply constraints remain acute, amplifying the price impact of even modest demand growth.\"Want to get ahead at work with AI? Sign up for CNBC's new online course, Beyond the Basics: How to Use AI to Supercharge Your Work.

    "body": "Yann LeCun, chief AI scientist at Meta Platforms, at the VivaTech conference in Paris, May 22, 2024.Bloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesMeta's former chief AI scientist, Yann Lecun, has called its 29-year-old AI boss \"inexperienced,\" and warned of a staff exodus from the company.Alexander Wang, the billionaire co-founder of Scale AI, joined Meta as its chief AI officer in 2025 after the tech giant bought a 49% stake in his startup. His hiring came amid an intensifying AI talent war, in which Meta reportedly offered $100 million signing bonuses to poach top talent from ChatGPT maker OpenAI, as it raced other hyperscalers to dominate the multibillion-dollar AI market with the most advanced models.Lecun, who's known as one of the \"godfathers of AI\" and quit Meta in November, called Wang \"young\" and \"inexperienced\" in an interview with the Financial Times.\"He learns fast, he knows what he doesn't know,\" Lecun said of Wang, who heads up Meta's new AI research unit TBD Labs and is tasked with building new AI models. But Lecun added: \"There's no experience with research or how you practice research, how you do it. Or what would be attractive or repulsive to a researcher.\"Lecun, 65, added that Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg \"basically lost confidence in everyone who was involved\" after the company was accused of gaming benchmarks to make its Llama 4 model look more impressive. Zuckerberg \"basically sidelined the entire Gen AI organization,\" Lecun said.\"A lot of people have left, a lot of people who haven't yet left will leave,\" Lecun added.\"We had a lot of new ideas and really cool stuff that they should implement. But they were just going for things that were essentially safe and proved,\" he said. \"When you do this, you fall behind.\"CNBC contacted Meta for a response, but had not received a response as this story went live.AI superintelligence is a 'dead end' for LLMsWhen asked about Meta's AI hiring drive, Lecun said: \"The future will say whether that was a good idea or not.\"But he added that \"LLMs basically are a dead end when it comes to superintelligence.\"\"I'm sure there's a lot of people at Meta, including perhaps Alex, who would like me to not tell the world that,\" Lecun said.Lecun's new startup, Advanced Machine Intelligence Labs, is focusing on \"world models:\" AI systems that learn from videos and physical data as well as language. Nabla, a health tech AI startup that partnered with Lecun's company in December, said in a press release that, unlike world models, LLMs \"still face some structural constraints, including hallucinations, non-deterministic reasoning and limited handling of continuous multimodal data, which make autonomous decision-making challenging.\" ",

    "body": "Dado Ruvic | ReutersThe traditional role of an investment banker is to provide advice on deals and financings. But JPMorgan's bankers recently began noticing that clients were asking for more from the firm – like how the nation's largest bank was navigating artificial intelligence or what cybersecurity practices it used. Chairman and CEO Jamie Dimon had an idea: formalize a group that can give certain clients access to much of JPMorgan's \"secret sauce.\" They're calling the initiative the \"Special Advisory Services,\" which launches Monday, with Liz Myers, who also serves as the global chair of investment banking, at the helm. \"These capabilities are on par or better with some of the specialized consulting firms out there,\" said Myers in an interview with CNBC. \"We think it could help C-suite executives be more effective in their roles and learn from our best practices.\" JPMorgan identified several dozen adjacent capabilities to offer clients, ranging from investor relations to real estate selection to health-care benefits to technology procurement. At the outset, the firm does not plan to charge for these services. However, if a client seeks a more time-consuming project or a service that exists on an ongoing basis, they may negotiate some sort of fee structure. The services are intended for clients that \"have, or seek to have, deep and long-term relationships with the firm,\" the company said in a press release. That cohort may include, \"companies considering JPMorgan as their lead IPO adviser, long-tenured clients preparing for transformational deals, or growing mid-sized clients looking to use JPMorgan as their primary operating bank,\" according to the release. \"More than two-thirds of our experts are internally facing people – their No. 1 job is to make sure they're delivering for our firm,\" Myers said. \"They're a precious resource, to some extent, so we have to be thoughtful about who gets it.\" Myers, a 30-year veteran of the firm, had previously served as global head of equity capital markets, and in her expanded role, she'll work with advisory teams and experts across JPMorgan. She said that in the beginning, the Special Advisory Services group will have a \"handful\" of people. And then over time, the firm may scale it if there's a sizable uptake in client demand. JPMorgan is scheduled to report fourth-quarter and full-year earnings next week. LSEG estimates that for the year through Dec. 11, JPMorgan raked in $9.44 billion in investment banking fees, making the firm No. 1 worldwide, with 7.4% of wallet share. ",

    "body": "Moor Studio | Digitalvision Vectors | Getty ImagesFollowing the U.S. military operation in Venezuela that led to the removal of its leader, Nicolas Maduro, AI-generated videos purporting to show Venezuelan citizens celebrating in the streets have gone viral on social media.These artificial intelligence clips, depicting rejoicing crowds, have amassed millions of views across major platforms like TikTok, Instagram and X. One of the earliest and most widely shared clips on X was posted by an account named \"Wall Street Apes,\" which has over 1 million followers on the platform. The post depicts a series of Venezuelan citizens crying tears of joy and thanking the U.S. and President Donald Trump for removing Maduro. The video has since been flagged by a community note, a crowdsourced fact-checking feature on X that allows users to add context to posts they believe are misleading. The note read: \"This video is AI generated and is currently being presented as a factual statement intended to mislead people.\"The clip has been viewed over 5.6 million times and reshared by at least 38,000 accounts, including by business mogul Elon Musk, before he eventually removed the repost. CNBC was unable to confirm the origin of the video, though fact-checkers at BBC and AFP said the earliest known version of the clip appeared on the TikTok account @curiousmindusa, which regularly posts AI-generated content.Even before such videos appeared, AI-generated images showing Maduro in U.S. custody were circulating prior to the Trump administration releasing an authentic image of the captured leader. The deposed Venezuelan president was captured on Jan. 3, 2026, after U.S. forces conducted airstrikes and a ground raid, an operation that has dominated global headlines at the start of the new year. Along with the AI-generated videos, the AFP's fact-check team also flagged a number of examples of misleading content about Maduro's ousting, including footage of celebrations in Chile falsely presented as scenes from Venezuela. Misinformation from major news events is not new. Similar false or misleading content has circulated during the Israeli-Palestine and Russia-Ukraine conflicts. However, the massive reach and realism of AI-generated content related to recent developments in Venezuela are stark examples of how AI is advancing as a tool for misinformation. Platforms such as Sora and Midjourney have made it easier than ever to quickly generate hyper-realistic video and pass it off as genuine in the chaos of fast-breaking events. The creators of that content often seek to amplify certain political narratives or sow confusion among global audiences.Last year, AI-generated videos of women complaining about losing their Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, benefits during a government shutdown also went viral. One such AI-generated video fooled Fox News, which presented it as real in an article that was later removed.In light of these trends, social media companies have faced growing pressure to step up efforts to label potentially misleading AI content.Last year, India's government proposed a law requiring such labeling, while Spain approved fines of up to 35 million euros for unlabeled AI materials.To address growing concerns, major platforms, including TikTok and Meta, have rolled out AI detection and labeling tools, though the results appear mixed.CNBC was able to identify some videos on TikTok presented as celebrations in Venezuela that were labeled as AI-generated. In the case of X, the platform has relied mostly on community notes for content labeling, a system critics say often reacts too slowly to prevent AI misinformation from spreading before being identified.Adam Mosseri, who oversees Instagram and Threads, acknowledged the challenge facing social media in a recent post. \"All the major platforms will do good work identifying AI content, but they will get worse at it over time as AI gets better at imitating reality,\" he said.\"There is already a growing number of people who believe, as I do, that it will be more practical to fingerprint real media than fake media,\" he added. — CNBC's Victoria Yeo contributed to this report ",

    "body": "A Chevron gas station in San Francisco, Oct. 28, 2025.Jason Henry | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesPresident Donald Trump's call for U.S. oil companies to rebuild Venezuela's energy sector after the overthrow of President Nicolás Maduro is easier said than done. Chevron holds the advantage as the only major U.S. oil company currently operating in Venezuela, according to Wall Street analysts. ExxonMobil and ConocoPhillips left the country after former President Hugo Chavez nationalized the industry and seized their assets in 2007. Venezuela has the largest proven crude oil reserves in the world, at 303 billion barrels, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. But a long and expensive road lies ahead for U.S. oil majors to restore Venezuela to its peak production of 3.5 million barrels per day reached in the 1990s.\"It's a high-risk area for oil companies to invest in,\" said Arne Lohmann Rasmussen, chief analyst and head of research at Global Risk Management.It would require roughly $53 billion of investment over the next 15 years to just maintain crude oil production level of 1.1 million barrels per day, or bpd, according to estimates from consulting firm Rystad Energy. The capital expenditures needed to reach 3 million bpd by 2040 would more than triple, to $183 billion, according to Rystad.Certainty and stabilityU.S. oil majors will want certainty about who is charge in Caracas and how stable the government is, said Bob McNally, founder of Rapidan Energy. They will need to know whether the legal and fiscal regime will last long term because energy investments are 30-year projects, said David Goldwyn, who served as the State Department's special envoy for international energy affairs from 2009 to 2011.The situation in Caracas right now is anything but certain. Trump declared Saturday that the U.S. will run Venezuela after Maduro's overthrow. Secretary of State Marco Rubio appeared to backtrack, telling NBC News in a Sunday interview that the U.S. will use its leverage to pressure Caracas to meet U.S. demands. Vice President Delcy Rodriguez has assumed power in Venezuela, pledging over the weekend that the government would defend the country's resources, but later said Caracas sought to cooperate with the U.S. A major question is whether Venezuela could return to a regime similar to Maduro's in the future and nationalize oil assets again, said Global Risk Management's Rasmussen.Surplus reserves U.S. oil majors will grapple with whether it makes financial sense to invest tens of billions of dollars in Venezuela when there is already so much oil in the world, said McNally, a former White House energy advisor under President George W. Bush. \"There are plenty of reasons to think this is going to be more of a long and winding road, rather than a quick shot,\" McNally said.Chevron maintains joint ventures with state-owned Petróleos de Venezuela through a special licensed issued by the U.S. government. Those partnerships are responsible for about 23% of Venezuela's output, according to JPMorgan. \"The company would be in an advantaged position to potentially scale future output as they have significant oil resources in place through their JVs and have been a key developer of the country's energy infrastructure,\" JPMorgan analyst Arun Jayaram told clients in a Monday note. Chevron shares climbed more than 5% Monday. — CNBC's Hayley Cuccinello contributed to this report. ",

    "body": "Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC) signage on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York, US, on Friday, Jan. 2, 2026.Michael Nagle| Bloomberg | Getty ImagesSemiconductor stocks rallied to start the year, led by the world's biggest memory chip firms that are getting a boost from continued artificial intelligence-related demand. South Korea's SK Hynix and Samsung Electronics, the world's two biggest memory makers, are up 11.5% and 15.9% respectively year-to-date. Micron is 9% higher this year. Memory is a core component of the type of chips required to train and run AI models such as those designed by Nvidia and AMD. As tech giants continue to spend billions of dollars buying those chips and building out AI data centers, memory is in short supply.In particular, a specific component called dynamic random-access memory or DRAM, which is used in AI data centers, saw a huge price spike in 2025. Memory prices are expected to rise another 40% through the second quarter of 2026, according to Counterpoint Research.\"The recent rally across the semiconductor space has been driven largely by the memory side of the market rather than logic chips,\" Ben Barringer, head of technology research at Quilter Cheviot, told CNBC by email.\"We're seeing a combination of very strong demand from AI workloads and relatively constrained supply, particularly in high-bandwidth memory, which is essential for training and running large AI models.\"This is seen as positive for Samsung, SK Hynix, and Micron as they are expected to be in a position to charge a higher price for their memory chips as demand shows no sign of abating. Investor sentiment is positive on these names as they prepare to report their fourth-quarter earnings in the coming week, with analysts expecting a huge profit surge.Samsung is seen reporting a 140% jump in fourth-quarter operating profit, according to LSEG estimates. Meanwhile, Micron's earnings per share are expected to rise more than 400% year-on-year in the December quarter.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconMicron and ASML stocks have rallied this year so far. The rally in memory chip stocks has fed through to other parts of the supply chain as investors expect strong AI demand seen in 2025 to continue this year.Intel shares are up nearly 7%, while Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. — the world's biggest semiconductor maker — has risen nearly 10%. Both companies, which manufacture various types of semiconductors, are seen benefiting from a continued AI boom.Meanwhile, ASML, the Dutch firm that designs critical machines required to manufacture the most advanced chips in the world, has seen its shares rise nearly 14% this year. Bernstein on Sunday raised its price target for ASML's stock from 800 euros ($937) to 1,300 euros, implying a roughly 24% rise from Tuesday's trading price. \"ASML stands to benefit enormously from the wave of capacity expansion planned for 2026 and 2027,\" with memory chips, Bernstein analysts wrote in their note on Sunday. The analysts added that ASML will benefit \"from the upcoming DRAM super cycle.\"Analysts expect memory makers like Samsung and other manufacturers to increase their production capacity for memory, which will benefit ASML because its tools are needed to make these more advanced memory chips. \"Recent comments from SK Hynix pointing to a potential HBM supercycle have reinforced the idea that this is not just a short-term bounce, but a more structural shift linked to the ongoing build-out of AI infrastructure,\" Barringer said.\"That has helped improve sentiment across the sector, especially for companies with direct exposure to AI-driven memory demand.\"",

    "body": "Sen. Mark Kelly, D-Ariz., holds a news conference in the Mansfield Room in the U.S. Capitol on Monday, December 1, 2025. Bill Clark | Cq-roll Call, Inc. | Getty ImagesThe Pentagon will cut the military retirement pay of Sen. Mark Kelly for what Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth called the Arizona Democrat's \"seditious\" statements on a video with other members of Congress telling service members they have the right to refuse to execute illegal orders.Hegseth also issued a formal letter of censure against Kelly, which the Defense secretary said details  \"reckless misconduct\" by the retired Navy captain and astronaut.Hegesth said the Defense Department has begun a proceeding aimed at reducing Kelly's rank in retirement, which would in turn lead to a decrease in retirement pay. \"Six weeks ago, Senator Mark Kelly — and five other members of Congress — released a reckless and seditious video that was clearly intended to undermine good order and military discipline,\" Hegseth said in a statement on X.\"As a retired Navy Captain who is still receiving a military pension, Captain Kelly knows he is still accountable to military justice. And the Department of War — and the American people — expect justice,\" Hegseth said.Kelly has 30 days to file a response to the decision to cut his rank and retirement pay, according to Hegseth's tweet.The Pentagon in November announced a probe of Kelly for his involvement with the video, and said that further actions could include a recall to active duty and a court-martial proceeding. Hegeth's statement on Monday suggests that the Pentagon has ruled out that more severe option.But, in his tweet, Hegseth warned, \"Captain Kelly's status as a sitting United States Senator does not exempt him from accountability, and further violations could result in further action.\"Kelly, in a statement on X, vowed to fight the disciplinary action \"with everything I've got,\" and called Hegseth \"the most unqualified Secretary of Defense in our country's history.\"\"Over twenty-five years in the U.S. Navy, thirty-nine combat missions, and four missions to space, I risked my life for this country and to defend our Constitution – including the First Amendment rights of every American to speak out,\" Kelly wrote. \"I never expected that the President of the United States and the Secretary of Defense would attack me for doing exactly that.\"\"My rank and retirement are things that I earned through my service and sacrifice for this country. I got shot at. I missed holidays and birthdays. I commanded a space shuttle mission while my wife Gabby recovered from a gunshot wound to the head– all while proudly wearing the American flag on my shoulder,\" Kelly wrote. \"Generations of servicemembers have made these same patriotic sacrifices for this country, earning the respect, appreciation, and rank they deserve.\"Pete Hegseth wants to send the message to every single retired servicemember that if they say something he or Donald Trump doesn't like, they will come after them the same way,\" the senator said. \"It's outrageous and it is wrong. There is nothing more un-American than that.\"The video that Kelly spoke on was made in response to the U.S. military conducting 20 airstrikes on boats in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific Ocean against purported drug smugglers, killing scores of people.Read more CNBC politics coverageDeposed Venezuelan leader Maduro, wife to appear in New York court after U.S. captureDenmark tells Trump to stop threatening to seize GreenlandTrump admin pressed on pardon for ex-Honduras president after Venezuela's Maduro snatchedRubio explains how U.S. might 'run' Venezuela after Maduros' ousterTrump: We are going to run Venezuela until we can do a safe transitionTrump's removal of Maduro prompts questions from CongressWatch Trump's full comments following the U.S. strike against VenezuelaU.S. indictment against Venezuela President Maduro, wife is unsealedThe legality of those strikes, which were made without authorization from Congress, has been questioned.In the video, which was posted on X on Nov. 18, Kelly says, \"Our laws are clear: you can refuse illegal orders.\"The five other Democratic members of Congress who delivered similar messages on the same video are Michigan Sen. Elissa Slotkin, House Reps. Jason Crow of Colorado, Maggie Goodlander of New Hampshire, and Chris Deluzio and Chrissy Houlahan, both of Pennsylvania.Slotkin is a former CIA analyst. Deluzio and Goodlander are former Navy officers, and Houlahan is a former Air Force officer.But unlike Kelly, the other three veterans on the video separated from their service branches rather than retiring from them. As a result, they are not subject to the Uniform Code of Military Justice, as Kelly is.Hegseth, in his statement on Monday, said about the Pentagon's move to discipline Kelly: \"These actions are based on Captain Kelly's public statements from June through December 2025 in which he characterized lawful military operations as illegal and counseled members of the Armed Forces to refuse lawful orders.\"\"This conduct was seditious in nature and violated Articles 133 and 134 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice, to which Captain Kelly remains subject as a retired officer receiving pay,\" Hegseth said.Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer condemned the Pentagon's action on Monday.\"Mark Kelly is a hero and a patriot committed to serving the American people,\" Schumer, D-N.Y., wrote in a tweet responding to Hegseth.\"Pete Hegseth is a lap dog committed to serving one man – Donald Trump. This is a despicable act of political retribution,\" Schumer wrote. \"I stand with Sen. Kelly, who will always do the right thing no matter the consequences.\"",

    "body": "Michael Burry attends the premiere of \"The Big Short\" at Ziegfeld Theatre on Nov. 23, 2015 in New York.Dimitrios Kambouris | Getty ImagesMichael Burry's quiet bet on Venezuelan oil is coming back into focus.The investor best known for \"The Big Short\" said he has owned Valero Energy since 2020, a position he views as increasingly attractive as the U.S. moves toward a deeper role in reviving Venezuela's oil industry.\"Realize that many Gulf Coast refineries were purpose-built for Venezuelan heavy crude,\" Burry wrote in a Monday blog post on Substack. \"So they have been running with suboptimal feedstock for years. This will, in time, produce better margins across jet fuel, asphalt, and diesel ... I have owned Valero since 2020, and I am more resolved to holding it even longer after this weekend.\"His comments came after President Donald Trump called on U.S. oil companies to invest in Venezuela after the overthrow of President Nicolás Maduro. Venezuela, a founding member of OPEC, sits on the largest proven crude oil reserves in the world. The country's oil is among the heaviest and most sulfur-laden in the world, and only a limited number of refineries are equipped to process it efficiently.Valero stands out because of its ability to process heavy crude, but Burry said smaller refiners such as PBF Energy and HF Sinclair could also benefit, even if Venezuelan oil arrives only gradually. Any meaningful recovery in exports is likely to take years.Multiple analysts on Wall Street are also highlighting Valero as the biggest beneficiary, should Venezuelan supply increase. Shares of the refiner jumped about 10% Monday. The opportunity may extend beyond refining. Venezuela's oil infrastructure has deteriorated after decades of underinvestment, creating potential demand for U.S. oilfield services companies if large-scale rehabilitation begins, Burry said.Burry said he owns Halliburton, and sees possible upside as well for Schlumberger and Baker Hughes, which could be tapped to help rebuild pipelines and refineries.\"Venezuelan pipelines and refineries are old and in disrepair. This work will go to U.S. contractors,\" he said. \"Chevron is already there. Exxon and others have been litigating claims for decades and may see some justice relatively soon, if the US literally begins to run Venezuela as some have suggested. I own Halliburton, and may buy more shares or LEAPs.\"LEAPs, or long-term equity anticipation securities, are options with lengthy expiration dates that could go beyond one year.",

    "body": "A motorcycle passes in front of an oil-themed mural in Caracas, Venezuela on May 9, 2022.Nurphoto | Nurphoto | Getty ImagesCrude oil prices rose Monday, as the overthrow of President Nicolas Maduro by the Trump administration has cast deep uncertainty over oil-rich Venezuela. U.S. crude oil rose $1, or 1.74%, to close at $58.32 per barrel. Global benchmark Brent gained $1.01, or 1.66%, to settle at $61.76 per barrel. President Donald Trump made it clear Saturday that U.S. investment in Venezuela's oil sector is a key objective of the regime change operation that ousted Maduro.\"We're going to have our very large United States oil companies — the biggest anywhere in the world — go in, spend billions of dollars, fix the badly broken infrastructure, the oil infrastructure,\" Trump said in a press conference from his Mar-a-Lago residence in Palm Beach, Florida.The president said Saturday that the U.S. embargo of Venezuelan oil remains in place. Venezuela, a founding member of OPEC, sits on the largest proven crude oil reserves in the world at 303 billion barrels or about 17% of the global total, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.Caracas produced about 3.5 million barrels per day at its peak in the late 1990s, but output has declined significantly since then, according to energy consulting firm Kpler. The South American nation is currently producing about 800,000 bpd, Kpler data shows. Chevron is the only U.S. oil major operating in Venezuela. It was exporting about 140,000 bpd at the end of the fourth quarter of 2025, according to Kpler. The impact of Maduro's overthrow on oil prices is ambiguous in the short run, said Daan Struyven, head of oil research at Goldman Sachs. Production could edge higher if a U.S.-supported government is installed and the Trump administration lifts sanctions against Venezuela, Struveyn told clients in a Sunday note. But Maduro's ouster could also lead to supply disruptions in the short term, the analyst said. Long term, U.S. investment that boosts Venezuelan production would put downward pressure on oil prices, Struvyven said. A recovery of production, however, will likely be gradual and partial, he said. Oil executives operating in Venezuela say it will cost $10 billion annually to turn production around and a stable security environment is essential to grow production back to historic levels, said Helima Croft, head of global commodity strategy at RBC Capital Markets. Full sanctions relief could bring several hundred thousand barrels of production back over a 12-month period if there is an orderly transition of power, Croft told clients in a Saturday note. \"However, all bets are off in a chaotic change of power scenario like what occurred in Libya or Iraq,\" she said.",

Evelyn Hockstein | ReutersThe Trump administration on Monday briefed congressional leaders on the U.S. military operation that captured Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro, sharpening a partisan divide over the president's authority to use force without congressional approval.Top Republicans who attended the classified briefing rallied to the president's defense while Democrats questioned the scope of the operation and pushed to halt further military action.The partisan split-screen among the lawmakers briefed, who are part of the so-called \"Gang of Eight\" group authorized to receive highly classified information, underscores the difficulty Congress may face in trying to rein in President Donald Trump's military efforts. U.S. President Donald Trump has, in recent days, said the U.S. would \"run\" Venezuela, threatened Colombia and Cuba and renewed his push to acquire Greenland. Those remarks followed a weekend military strike that captured Maduro from Caracas and whisked him to the U.S. to face criminal charges without prior congressional authorization. House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., called the raid in Venezuela \"a decisive and justified action,\" rejecting claims that Trump exceeded his authority.\"We are not at war, we do not have U.S. armed forces in Venezuela and we are not occupying that country,\" Johnson said. Read more CNBC politics coverageDeposed Venezuelan leader Maduro, wife to appear in New York court after U.S. captureDenmark tells Trump to stop threatening to seize GreenlandTrump admin pressed on pardon for ex-Honduras president after Venezuela's Maduro snatchedRubio explains how U.S. might 'run' Venezuela after Maduros' ousterTrump: We are going to run Venezuela until we can do a safe transitionTrump's removal of Maduro prompts questions from CongressWatch Trump's full comments following the U.S. strike against VenezuelaU.S. indictment against Venezuela President Maduro, wife is unsealed\"The Constitution gives Congress the power to declare war; that is true. But it also vests the president of the United States with vast authorities as commander-in-chief,\" Johnson said. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., meanwhile, said that the briefing raised far more questions than it answered.\"The plan for the U.S. running Venezuela is vague, based on wishful thinking and unsatisfying,\" Schumer said. \"I did not receive any assurances that we would not try to do the same thing in other countries.\"Senate Democrats plan to force a vote later this week on a measure to suspend Trump's military action in Venezuela, known as a war powers resolution. The measure, brought by Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., would require Trump to cease military action in Venezuela unless Congress approves it. Kaine introduced a similar resolution in November, which the Senate rejected after only two Republicans — Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Rand Paul of Kentucky — supported it. Republicans hold a 53-47 majority in the Senate, so at least four Republicans would need to break ranks for Kaine's measure to succeed. The House of Representatives would also need to approve the measure. Lawmakers there narrowly defeated a Venezuela war powers resolution 211-213 in December. \"There's real concern as it relates to congressional action connected to our sole power to declare war,\" said House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., before the briefing. \"No further military action should be taken in Venezuela or anywhere else without explicit congressional approval, and we need to legislate that.\" The lawmakers were briefed by top members of the president's cabinet, including Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Attorney General Pam Bondi and CIA Director John Ratcliffe. The administration has labored to frame the use of the military in Venezuela as a law enforcement action, since Maduro had outstanding warrants for his arrest in the United States. Rep. Brian Mast, R-Fla, the Chair of the House Armed Services Committee, who was in the briefing, echoed that view. \"This was a law enforcement operation,\" Mast said. \"This law enforcement operation required great military capabilities … because the individual that had to be brought to justice could bring to bear an air force, a navy, an army.\" Mast said  Trump was not seeking a protracted military engagement, but did not rule out similar operations if the president deems them necessary to \"defend the homeland.\"The bipartisan leaders of the Senate Judiciary Committee, however, who have jurisdiction over the U.S. law enforcement apparatus, were not invited to the briefing. They are not traditionally part of the \"Gang of Eight,\" but issued a joint statement excoriating the snub. \"President Trump and Secretary Rubio have stated that this was a law enforcement operation that was made at the Department of Justice's (DOJ) request, with assistance from the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA),\" the statement from Chair Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, and ranking member Dick Durbin, D-Ill., read.    \"The administration's refusal to acknowledge our Committee's indisputable jurisdiction in this matter is unacceptable and we are following up to ensure the Committee receives warranted information regarding Maduro's arrest,\" they said. CNBC's Emily Wilkins contributed to this report. ",

    "body": "2026 Chevrolet Corvette ZR1X with Carbon Aero packageGMDETROIT — General Motors on Monday reported a 5.5% increase in its annual U.S. sales in 2025, despite a 6.9% decrease during the fourth quarter. The Detroit automaker's results were driven last year by incremental sales of EVs as well as gains in large SUVs and entry-level vehicles such as the Buick Envista. GM's 2025 sales are expected to be among the standouts for the U.S. automotive industry, which Cox Automotive expects to have risen about 2% to 16.3 million units compared with 2024.GM is among a handful of automakers to report U.S. sales gains for 2025. Others include Toyota Motor's sales being up 8%; Hyundai and Kia each achieving third consecutive years of record sales with 8.4% and 7% increases, respectively; and Honda Motor up 0.5%. Chrysler parent Stellantis was down 3.3% as it executes a U.S. turnaround plan. Notably, Stellantis' Jeep brand — which was up less than 1% last year — achieved its first U.S. annual sales gain since 2018.watch now\"With consecutive quarterly sales increases and market share growth, it's clear that we are taking the right steps to reset our business in the U.S.,\" Jeff Kommor, head of Stellantis U.S. retail sales, said in a release. \"There is still work to do, but we made progress this year with a diversified powertrain lineup.\"GM, meanwhile, retained its position as the largest seller of vehicles in the U.S. It's held that title for decades, aside from Toyota outselling the American automaker for one year amid major supply chain disruptions in 2021.GM sold more than 2.85 million vehicles last year in the U.S, including roughly 703,000 during the fourth quarter. That compares to Toyota at 2.52 million U.S. sales in 2025.\"Demand for our brands and products is strong at every price point, and we are well-positioned to build on this momentum in the year ahead,\" GM President of North America Duncan Aldred said in a statement. Aside from the U.S. sales crown, GM said it grew U.S. market share by half a percentage point, to 17%, and increased EV sales by 48% to become the country's No. 2 seller of all-electric vehicles behind Tesla.",

    "body": "The logo of pharmaceutical company Novo Nordisk is displayed in front of its offices in Bagsvaerd, on the outskirts of Copenhagen, Nov. 24, 2025.Tom Little | ReutersNovo Nordisk will start rolling out the first-ever GLP-1 pill for weight loss in the U.S. on Monday, the company announced, marking a new chapter of obesity treatment in the U.S. The drug's cash prices are among the lowest on the market, ranging from $149 to $299 per month, depending on the dose. That fuels hopes that pills could help address the long-standing affordability hurdles tied to the weekly injections dominating the weight loss drug market. The official launch of the oral drug, called the Wegovy pill, comes just two weeks after U.S. regulators cleared the treatment. The starting dose of 1.5 milligrams is available at more than 70,000 U.S. pharmacies such as CVS and Costco, as well as select telehealth providers, including Ro, LifeMD, Weight Watchers, GoodRx and Novo Nordisk's NovoCare Pharmacy. The higher, remaining doses of the pill will be available to patients by the end of the week, Novo Nordisk said. Cash-paying patients can pay $149 per month for the starting dose. The 4-milligram dose of the pill will also be available for $149 per month through April 15, then $199 per month after that. The highest doses of the Wegovy pill – 9 milligrams and 25 milligrams – will be available for $299 per month. Patients with insurance coverage for the drug can pay as little as $25 per month for the treatment. Cash-paying patients will also be able to access the starting dose of the pill for $149 per month on President Donald Trump's direct-to-consumer website, TrumpRx, under a deal Novo Nordisk struck with his administration in November. The site also launches in January, though it's unclear when. Novo Nordisk on Monday said the pill's availability \"opens new possibilities\" for the more than 100 million Americans living with obesity. Injections from Novo Nordisk and its chief rival, Eli Lilly, carry a list price of roughly $1,000 per month. But both companies offer lower cash-pay prices for their shots that range from $299 to $499 monthly, depending on the dose. Pills are the next battleground for the two companies, which established the booming GLP-1 space that some analysts say could be worth roughly $100 billion by the 2030s. Goldman Sachs analysts said in August that oral drugs could capture a 24% share — or around $22 billion — of the 2030 global weight loss drug market.The launch of Novo Nordisk's daily oral drug on Monday gives the company a clear head start. The Food and Drug Administration approved the treatment on Dec. 22 and will decide whether to clear a rival pill from Eli Lilly later this year. More CNBC health coverageThe Trump administration is changing Covid, childhood vaccine recommendations – here's what it means for youU.S. to impose 100% tariff on branded, patented drugs unless firms build plants locally, Trump saysEli Lilly to build $6.5 billion Texas manufacturing facility for obesity pill, other drugsThe FDA also approved Novo Nordisk's pill for use to reduce the risk of major cardiovascular events, such as death, heart attack or stroke, in adults with obesity and established cardiovascular disease. That's consistent with the approval label of the company's blockbuster weight loss drug Wegovy, which shares the same active ingredient, semaglutide. Both work by mimicking the gut hormone GLP-1 to suppress appetite.\"This moment is about changing what's possible in weight management, and to make that possible, we have worked to ensure [the Wegovy pill] is affordable and accessible to those who need it, however they choose to receive their care,\" said Ed Cinca, Novo Nordisk's senior vice president of marketing and patient solutions, in a release. People who take Novo Nordisk's pill have to wait 30 minutes before eating or drinking each day.In a phase three trial that followed more than 300 adults with obesity and not diabetes, the highest dose of Novo Nordisk's oral semaglutide helped patients lose up to 16.6% of their weight on average after 64 weeks. That weight loss was 13.6% when the company analyzed all patients regardless of whether they stopped the drug.The pill appears to be slightly more effective than Eli Lilly's experimental oral drug, which does not have dietary restrictions. ",

Odd Andersen | Afp | Getty ImagesEuropean leaders on Tuesday issued a joint statement to push back against U.S. President Donald Trump's renewed interest in Greenland, saying security in the Arctic must be achieved collectively. \"The Kingdom of Denmark – including Greenland – is part of NATO,\" the statement said, according to a letter published by Denmark's Prime Minister's Office on X. \"Security in the Arctic must therefore be achieved collectively, in conjunction with NATO allies including the United States, by upholding the principles of the UN Charter, including sovereignty, territorial integrity and the inviolability of borders. These are universal principles, and we will not stop defending them,\" they continued. \"Greenland belongs to its people. It is for Denmark and Greenland, and them only, to decide on matters concerning Denmark and Greenland.\"  The letter was signed by Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen, French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, as well as the leaders of Italy, Spain, and Poland.The coordinated message, which also described the U.S. as \"an essential partner\" in the push for Arctic security, comes as Trump once again sets his sights on the vast, mineral-rich and sparsely populated territory.Read moreThe U.S. president, who has long advocated for control over the self-governing Danish territory, told NBC News on Monday that he was \"very serious\" with his intent to acquire Greenland. Trump also said he had \"no timeline\" for doing so, however.Alarm bells have been ringing in Denmark, which is responsible for the defense of Greenland, given that Trump's remarks follow Washington's major military operation in Venezuela.Denmark's Frederiksen had previously warned that an American takeover of Greenland would amount to the end of the NATO military alliance.\"I believe that the U.S. president should be taken seriously when he says that he wants Greenland,\" Frederiksen told Danish broadcaster TV2 on Monday, according to a CNBC translation.\"But I also want to make it clear, that if the United States chooses to attack another NATO country militarily, then everything stops. That is, including our NATO and thus the security that has been provided since the end of the Second World War,\" she added.watch nowGreenland's prime minister, meanwhile, sought to downplay Trump's rhetoric, saying the territory intends to restore \"good cooperation\" with Washington.\"The situation is not such that the United States can simply conquer Greenland,\" Greenland's Nielsen said Monday at a press conference.",

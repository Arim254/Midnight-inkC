    "body": "U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell holds a press conference after the Fed cut interest rates by quarter of a percentage point, in Washington, D.C., U.S., Oct. 29, 2025.Kevin Lamarque | ReutersThe Federal Reserve meeting that wrapped up Wednesday both delivered on expectations and offered a few surprises. Here are five key takeaways:The Federal Open Market Committee, as expected, delivered its quarter percentage point rate cut, but not without some backstage intrigue that included two dissenting votes — one in each direction. While Governor Stephen Miran delivered a widely anticipated \"no\" vote because he preferred a half-point reduction, Kansas City Fed President Jeffrey Schmid wanted no cut, speaking for what is an apparently growing group of inflation hawks who are worried about the Fed's easing bias.Using uncharacteristically strong language, Chair Jerome Powell pushed back hard on another cut in December for which markets had been assigning about a 90% probability of happening. \"In the committee's discussions at this meeting, there were strongly differing views about how to proceed in December,\" Powell said during his news conference. \"A further reduction in the policy rate at the December meeting is not a foregone conclusion. Far from it.\" He went on to note there were \"strongly different views\" expressed by the 19 meeting participants and noted that the tone would be reflected in the meeting minutes, released in three weeks.Markets knew the end of QT was coming, but just weren't set on when. The committee laid that to rest and said quantitative tightening, or allowing assets to roll off the Fed's $6.6 trillion balance sheet, would end after the November operations. While Powell doused talk of a December cut, ending QT then could have a similar impact. At the same time, the committee indicated it would be reinvesting maturing mortgage notes in short-term bills, which Powell said will tilt the balance sheet to shorter duration with an even stronger lean toward Treasurys.On the question of inflation, Powell gave indications that it is drifting back towards the Fed's 2% goal but remains elevated — around 2.8% by the Fed's preferred measure. Tariffs are providing a boost to that number in the half percentage point range, but Powell said the view continues to be that the impact from the levies will be temporary. The inflation forecast for October is significant in that the Commerce Department will not be releasing an official number on the personal consumption expenditures price index due to the government shutdown.Powell gave a nod towards the uncertainty from the shutdown, but said the lack of public data likely doesn't change the economic picture, one of moderating growth, rising unemployment and \"somewhat elevated\" inflation. \"Although some important federal government data have been delayed due to the shutdown, the public and private sector data that have remained available suggests that the outlook for employment and inflation has not changed much since our meeting in September,\" he said.What they're saying:\"He kind of did a WWE slam on those expectations of a December rate cut. [The door is] not completely closed, I guess, but it was expected to be a foregone conclusion. And he came out pretty vociferously and said, 'Nope, better not think about it that way.'\" — Dan North, senior economist at Allianz\"So, regardless of the use of alternative data sources the Fed can draw on, we believe there is an increased chance that December's meeting may skip a cut, which would push off further accommodative rate moves into the new year, and potentially to a new Chair.\" — Rick Rieder, head of fixed income at BlackRock and finalist for Powell's job when his term as chair expires in May\"He tried to say it is not a foregone conclusion, but a December rate cut still seems likely. No Fed leader wants to be responsible for a slowdown or a recession.\" — Heather Long, chief economist at Navy Federal Credit Union",

The central bank instead decreased the federal funds rate by 25 basis points, or a quarter percentage point.Miran joined the Fed in September after being appointed by President Donald Trump and confirmed by the Senate. Schmid voted for the rate decrease in September, despite expressing some doubt about lowering interest rates during a CNBC interview in late August.",

Smith Collection/gado | Archive Photos | Getty ImagesSamsung Electronics reported a rebound in earnings on Thursday, with operating profit more than doubling from the previous quarter on a rebound in its chip business. Here are Samsung's third-quarter results compared with LSEG SmartEstimate, which is weighted toward forecasts from analysts who are more consistently accurate:Revenue: 86.1 trillion Korean won vs. 85.93 trillion won Operating profit: 12.2 trillion won vs. 11.25 trillion wonThe South Korean technology giant's quarterly revenue was up 8.85% from a year earlier, while its first-quarter operating profit climbed 32.9% year-over-year. Samsung shares popped over 5% in early trading in Asia.The earnings represent a bounce back from the June quarter, which had been weighed down by a massive slump in Samsung's chip business. Operating profit increased by 160% compared to June, while revenue increased by 15.5% over the same period. Samsung Electronics, South Korea's largest company by market capitalization, is a leading provider of memory chips, semiconductor foundry services and smartphones.Samsung's chip business reported a 19% increase in sales from the June quarter, with its memory business setting an all-time high for quarterly sales, driven by strong demand from artificial intelligence.The third-quarter operating profit also beat Samsung's own guidance of around 12.1 trillion Korean won. Chip Business Samsung Electronics' chip business posted an operating profit of 7.0 trillion Korean won in the third quarter, up from 3.86 trillion in the same period last year. Chip revenue increased to 33.1 trillion won, compared to 29.27 trillion last year. Samsung's chip business, also known as its Device Solutions division, encompasses its memory chip, semiconductor design and foundry business units. The division achieved record-high quarterly revenue on expanded sales of its high-bandwidth memory chips — a type of memory used for artificial intelligence computing. Once the undisputed leader in memory chips, Samsung has been dealing with increased competition as it falls behind rival SK Hynix in high-bandwidth memory, or HBM.However, Samsung reportedly passed Nvidia's qualification tests for an advanced HBM product last month.A report from Counterpoint Research earlier this month found that Samsung had reclaimed the top spot in the memory market ahead of SK Hynix in the third quarter after falling behind its competitor for the first time the quarter prior. ",

Smith Collection/gado | Archive Photos | Getty ImagesCoffee delivery has turned into a $1 billion business for Starbucks.The coffee giant said on Wednesday that its annual delivery sales crossed the milestone in fiscal 2025, which ended on Sept. 30. In the company's fiscal fourth quarter, delivery sales climbed almost 30% compared with the year-ago period, executives said.The growth of Starbucks' delivery initiative comes as the company's broader U.S. business embarks on a turnaround. Starbucks reported flat U.S. same-store sales in the fiscal fourth quarter, reversing the previous seven quarters of domestic same-store sales declines as customers made their coffee at home or defected to rivals.The coffee giant began testing delivery roughly a decade ago, but Starbucks has been slower to roll it out than many other restaurant companies. Nationwide delivery became available through Uber Eats in 2020, DoorDash in 2023 and Grubhub last year. Today, the vast majority of the coffee chain's company-operated U.S. cafes offer delivery.U.S. consumers have also been slower to embrace coffee delivery than other markets, like China. In Starbucks' home market, drive-thru lanes and mobile order options offer similar convenience without the delivery fees.Perhaps to justify the higher cost, the typical Starbucks delivery order is nearly twice the size of an in-store transaction, according to the company. More than 40% of the chain's delivery orders include food.Though broader restaurant spending has slowed as consumers face higher costs, food delivery hasn't seen the same plummeting sales. Discounts and promotions have helped third-party apps hold onto customers, along with their moves to branch out into new categories, like alcohol and grocery delivery.",

    "body": "The American multinational chain Starbucks Coffee store and logo seen displayed. Sopa Images | Lightrocket | Getty ImagesStarbucks on Wednesday reported that its quarterly same-store sales returned to growth for the first time in nearly two years, showing that its turnaround strategy is winning over lapsed customers.The coffee chain's global same-store sales rose 1%, lifted by international markets. Its U.S. same-store sales were flat for the quarter but turned positive in September. Wall Street was projecting global same-store sales declines of 0.3% and a 0.9% decrease in U.S. same-store sales.\"We're a year into our 'Back to Starbucks' strategy, and it's clear that our turnaround is taking hold,\" CEO Brian Niccol said in a statement.Domestic same-store sales turned positive in September, and the company has held onto that momentum through October, Niccol said on the company's conference call. However, CFO Cathy Smith cautioned analysts against cheering too soon.\"Turnarounds are difficult to forecast, and while we have good reason to believe that our U.S. company-operated [same-store sales] should build through the year, we also know that recoveries are not always linear,\" she said.The company suspended its annual forecast a year ago, and it is not expecting to release a near- or long-term outlook until an investor day slated for late January.Shares of Starbucks rose 2% in extended trading.Here's what the company reported for the quarter ended Sept. 28 compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:Earnings per share: 52 cents adjusted vs. 56 cents expectedRevenue: $9.57 billion vs. $9.35 billion expectedThe coffee giant reported fiscal fourth-quarter net income attributable to Starbucks of $133.1 million, or 12 cents per share, down from $909.3 million, or 80 cents per share, a year earlier.Excluding restructuring costs, litigation settlements and other items, Starbucks earned 52 cents per share. During the quarter, the company closed 627 locations and laid off roughly 900 nonretail employees as part of a restructuring plan.In addition to the restructuring plan, Starbucks has been investing heavily in labor, including adding assistant store managers to many North American cafes. The added labor costs weighed on its operating margin this quarter.Net sales rose 5% to $9.57 billion.To revive U.S. sales, Starbucks has focused on improving the in-store experience for customers and cutting service times to under four minutes per order. More than 80% of company-operated locations have an average service time of four minutes or less, even as the chain saw a rise in traffic after it launched its fall menu, according to Niccol.The company's marketing efforts have switched from promotions and limited-time items to highlighting its coffee and trendy innovation, like protein-packed cold foam.The strategy has succeeded in winning back some U.S. customers. Smith said that the number of 90-day active Starbucks Rewards members grew 1% both quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year.Outside Starbucks' home market, same-store sales increased 3%, fueled by a 6% jump in traffic.In China, the company's second-largest market, same-store sales rose 2%, boosted by a 9% climb in traffic. Under pressure in the country from home-grown rivals with cheaper beverages, Starbucks has lowered prices on many of its iced drinks to bring back customers.The company is also exploring selling a stake in its China business after years of sales declines in the competitive market. Niccol previously told CNBC's Jim Cramer that the company values the China business at more than $10 billion.\"On the strategic front, we have had very strong interest from multiple high quality partners, all of whom see significant value in the Starbucks brand and team,\" Niccol said on Wednesday. \"We expect to retain a meaningful stake in Starbucks China and remain confident in the long term growth potential in the region.\"",

David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesGoogle parent Alphabet is planning a \"significant increase\" in spend next year as it continues to invest in AI infrastructure to meet the demand of its customer backlog, executives said Wednesday.The company reported its first $100 billion revenue quarter on Wednesday, beating Wall Street's expectations for Alphabet's third quarter. Executives then said that the company plans to grow its capital spend for this year.\"With the growth across our business and demand from Cloud customers, we now expect 2025 capital expenditures to be in a range of $91 billion to $93 billion,\" the company said in its earnings report. It marks the second time the company increased its capital expenditure this year. In July, the company increased its expectation from $75 billion to $85 billion, most of which goes toward investments in projects like new data centers.There'll be even more spend in 2026, executives said Wednesday.\"Looking out to 2026, we expect a significant increase in CapEx and will provide more detail on our fourth quarter earnings call,\" said Anat Ashkenazi, Alphabet's finance chief.The latest increases come as companies across the industry race to build more infrastructure to keep up with billions in customer demand for the compute necessary to power AI services. Also on Wednesday, Meta raised the low end of its guidance for 2025 capital expenditures by $4 billion, saying it expects that figure to come in between $70 billion and $72 billion. That figure was previously $66 billion to $72 billion.Google executives explained that they're racing to meet demand for cloud services, which saw a 46% quarter-over-quarter growth to the backlog in the third quarter.\"We continue to drive strong growth in new businesses,\" CEO Sundar Pichai said. \"Google Cloud accelerated, ending the quarter with $155 billion in backlog.\"The company reported 32% cloud revenue growth from the year prior and is keeping pace with its megacap competitors. Pichai and Ashkenazi said the company has received more $1 billion deals in the last nine months than it had in the past two years combined. In August, Google won a $10 billion cloud contract from Meta spanning six years. Anthropic last week announced a deal that gives the artificial intelligence company access to up to 1 million of Google's custom-designed Tensor Processing Units, or TPUs. The deal is worth tens of billions of dollars.The spend on infrastructure is also helping the company improve its own AI products, executives said on the call.Google's flagship AI app Gemini now has more than 650 million monthly active users. That's up from the 450 million active users Pichai reported the previous quarter. Search also improved thanks to AI advancements, executives said. Google's search business generated $56.56 billion in revenue — up 15% from the prior year, tempering fears that the competitive AI landscape may be cannibalizing the company's core search and ads business.AI Mode, Google's AI product that lays within its search engine, has 75 million daily active users in the U.S., and those search queries doubled over the third quarter, executives said. They also reiterated that the company is testing ads in that AI Mode product.WATCH: Google catching up with Meta pulled on shares following earnings, says D.A. Davidson's Gil Luriawatch now",

Jim Watson | AFP | Getty ImagesThe Federal Reserve on Wednesday approved its second straight interest rate cut, though Chair Jerome Powell rattled markets when he threw doubt on whether another reduction is coming in December.By a 10-2 vote, the central bank's Federal Open Market Committee lowered its benchmark overnight borrowing rate to a range of 3.75%-4%. In addition to the rate move, the Fed announced that it would be ending the reduction of its asset purchases – a process known as quantitative tightening – on Dec 1.Governor Stephen Miran again cast a dissenting vote, preferring the Fed move more quickly with a half-point cut. Kansas City Fed President Jeffrey Schmid joined Miran in dissenting but for the opposite reason – he preferred the Fed not cut at all. Miran is an appointee of President Donald Trump, who has pushed hard on the committee to lower rates quickly.The rate also sets a benchmark for a variety of consumer products such as auto loans, mortgages and credit cards.The post-meeting statement did not provide any direction on what the committee's plans are for December. At the September meeting, officials indicated the likelihood of three total cuts this year. The Fed meets once more in December.Powell, however, cautioned against assuming that a rate cut is a sure thing at the next meeting.\"In the committee's discussions at this meeting, there were strongly differing views about how to proceed in December,\" Powell said during his post-meeting news conference. \"A further reduction in the policy rate at the December meeting is not a foregone conclusion. Far from it.\"He later added that there is \"a growing chorus\" among the 19 Fed officials to \"at least wait a cycle\" before cutting again. Traders lowered odds for a December cut to 67% from 90% a day ago, according to the CME Group's FedWatch.Stocks, which had been higher after the initial decision was released, turned lower on the chair's comments. Major averages slowly came back during the session with reporters.The reduction came even though the Fed essentially has been flying blind lately on economic data.Other than the consumer price index release last week, the government has suspended all data collection and reports, meaning such key measures as nonfarm payrolls, retail sales and a plethora of other macro data is unavailable.In the post-meeting statement, the committee acknowledged the uncertainty accompanying the lack of data, qualifying the way it categorized broad economic conditions.\"Available indicators suggest that economic activity has been expanding at a moderate pace. Job gains have slowed this year, and the unemployment rate has edged up but remained low through August; more recent indicators are consistent with these developments,\" the statement said. \"Inflation has moved up since earlier in the year and remains somewhat elevated.\"Each of those characterizations represented tweaks from the September statement. The most significant change was the view on broad economic activity. In September, the FOMC said activity had moderated.The statement reiterated concerns that policymakers have over the labor market, saying that \"downside risks to employment rose in recent months.\"Even before the shutdown, evidence had begun to build that while layoffs have been contained, the pace of hiring had flattened. At the same time, inflation has held considerably above the Fed's 2% annual goal. The CPI report last week, released because of its importance to Social Security cost-of-living adjustments, showed the annual rate at 3%, pushed by higher energy costs as well as several items with direct or indirect links to Trump's tariffs.The Fed tries to strike a balance between full employment and stable prices. Officials lately, though, have said they see a slightly higher risk posed by the jobs picture. Along with the interest rate decision, the Fed said its process of reducing the amount of bonds it holds on the central bank's $6.6 trillion balance sheet will end.The program, also known as QT, had shaved some $2.3 trillion off the Fed's portfolio of Treasurys and mortgage-backed securities. Instead of reinvesting maturing proceeds from the securities, the Fed has been allowing them to roll off the balance sheet at a limited level each month. However, recent signs of some tightening in short-term lending markets have raised concern that the roll-off has gone far enough.An implementation note accompanying the decision indicated the Fed will be rolling proceeds from maturing mortgage securities into shorter-term bills.Markets recently had begun anticipating that the Fed would end QT either in October or by the end of the year. The Fed expanded its holdings during the Covid crisis, pushing the balance sheet from just over $4 trillion to close to $9 trillion. Powell has said that while the Fed found it necessary to shrink its holdings, he did not foresee a return to pre-pandemic levels.In fact, Evercore ISI analyst Krishna Guha said he could foresee a scenario where the Fed actually restarts the purchases early in 2026 for \"organic growth purposes\" as market conditions shift. The Fed rarely eases monetary policy during economic expansions and bull markets in stocks. Major averages, though volatile, have been posting a series of record highs, boosted by further gains in Big Tech stocks and a robust earnings season.History has shown that the market continues to rise when the Fed does cut under such circumstances. However, easier policy also poses the risk of higher inflation, a condition that forced the Fed into a series of aggressive rate hikes.Correction: This story has been updated to correct that Jeffrey Schmid is president of the Kansas City Fed, and that the Fed raised interest rates following an inflation spike.",

    "body": "U.S. Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Marty Makary speaks during a press conference alongside U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr., and Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Administrator Mehmet Oz, discussing administration plans to lower drug costs, at the Department of Health and Human Services in Washington, D.C., U.S., Oct. 29, 2025. Annabelle Gordon | ReutersThe Food and Drug Administration on Wednesday said it will take steps to speed up the process of developing generic versions of complex biological drugs, in a bid to increase cheaper competition for expensive medicines and lower drug costs for Americans. It's the Trump administration's latest move to rein in high prescription drug costs in the U.S., where medication prices are two-to-three times higher than those in other developed nations. The move to support the development and approval of so-called biosimilars could be a blow to pharmaceutical companies, whose most profitable products are often biological products that treat serious and chronic diseases. The exact impact will depend on the drugmaker and its products.In a statement on Wednesday, a Health and Human Services Department spokesperson said the law gives manufacturers 12 years of exclusivity for biologic medicines, which is a \"primary determining factor in drug development decision-making.\"\"No manufacturer should anticipate a monopoly or anything else beyond what is legally granted,\" the spokesperson said. The FDA's new reforms \"will take the five-to-eight year timeframe to bring a biosimilar to market and cut it in half,\" the agency's Commissioner Marty Makary said during a press conference on Wednesday.During the event, HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said the FDA has an \"outdated and burdensome approval process that has slowed down the entry of biosimilars.\" He said \"even when [the drugs] do get approved, current laws often prevent pharmacists or patients from substituting them for patients who would benefit from a more affordable option.\"\"That all ends today, a the FDA is taking bold, decisive action to break down these barriers and open the markets for real competition,\" Kennedy said.Biological products are engineered with living cells, which makes manufacturing more complex than for chemically derived drugs. Biologics have a special pathway to FDA approval, and it is harder for generic drug manufacturers to sell cheaper versions due to the high costs of development and difficult regulatory landscape. Biologic medications make up only 5% of prescriptions in the U.S., but account for 51% of total drug spending as of 2024, according to an FDA release. FDA-approved biosimilars are as safe and effective as their branded counterparts, yet their market share remains below 20%, the agency added. The FDA said it has so far approved 76 biosimilars, making up only a small fraction of approved biologic drugs.Kennedy said biosimilars, on average, cost half the price of their branded counterparts. Their entry into the market drives down brand-name drug prices by another 25%, which is a \"real relief for patients,\" he added. Biosimilar generics saved $20 billion in U.S. health-care costs last year alone, the FDA said.In a new draft guidance, the FDA proposed major updates to simplify biosimilar studies. For example, the agency recommended that human studies directly comparing the biosimilar to a branded product may not be necessary for drug companies to conduct. That research takes years and costs tens of millions of dollars. Biosimilars have historically struggled to gain market share from their branded counterparts compared to generic copies of small-molecule drugs, which are often delivered in pill form and can enter cells easily because it has a low molecular weight.The difference is that many biosimilars aren't identical copies of branded biologic drugs, while generics are. In many cases, pharmacists can't directly substitute a branded biologic for a biosimilar when filling a prescription unless they are classified as \"interchangeable\" and it is permitted by state law. But the FDA on Wednesday said it generally recommends against requiring so-called \"switching studies,\" which determine whether biosimilars have that classification. That step is not required for generic copies of small-molecule drugs. \"These additional studies can slow development and create public confusion about biosimilar safety,\" the FDA said in a release.",

The company said it expects Trump's law to result in \"a significant reduction\" in its U.S. federal cash tax payments for the rest of 2025 and future years.The company's third-quarter sales rose 26% year-over-year, which is its highest revenue growth since the first quarter of 2024.Meta said it expects fourth quarter revenue to be in the range of $56 billon to $59 billion. The midpoint of that range comes in above what was expected by analysts, according to StreetAccount.The company raised the low end of its total expenses for the year by $2 billion, saying expenses will come in between $116 billion to $118 billion. That figure was previously $114 billion to $118 billion.CEO Mark Zuckerberg said Meta consistently requires more computing power for its artificial intelligence initiatives, resulting in more spending on related data center and cloud services.\"That suggests that being able to make a significantly larger investment here is very likely to be a profitable thing over, over some period,\" Zuckerberg added.The company also raised its 2025 guidance for capital expenditures, which will now come in the range of $70 billion to $72 billion. It's prior outlook was between the range of $66 to $72 billion.Meta's Reality Labs hardware unit reported a third-quarter loss of $4.4 billion on $470 million in sales.Revenue for Reality Labs in the fourth quarter is expected to come in lower than it did for the same period in 2024, Meta finance chief Susan Li said on a call with analysts. Li said that was due to the company not releasing a new VR headset this year and because retailers who bought inventory of Meta's previous headset for the holiday shopping season did so during the third quarter.\"We're still expecting significant year-over-year growth in AI glasses revenue in Q4 as we benefit from strong demand for the recent products that we've introduced, but that is more than offset by the headwinds to the Quest headsets,\" Li said.The company in September revealed the $799 Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses, which are Meta's first consumer-ready AI glasses with a built-in display and an accompanying wristband with neural technology. Zuckerberg said the product is sold out and that demo slots are booked through the end of November.\"We're going to have to invest in increasing manufacturing and selling more of those,\" he said.The company said that it saw 3.54 billion daily active people across its apps for the quarter, ahead of Wall Street's expectations of 3.5 billion daily active people.Meta's advertising sales were $50.08 billion during the third quarter, ahead of Wall Street's expectations of $48.5 billion.The company has spent the year investing heavily in AI, and it conducted a massive overhaul of the organization leading those efforts after the lukewarm debut of its open-source Llama 4 software in April.Meta said last Wednesday that it would lay off about 600 workers in its Superintelligence Labs AI unit, but it left that group's top-tier TBD Labs unscathed. A day before, Meta said it formed a joint venture agreement with Blue Owl Capital in a deal worth $27 billion to help fund and build a gigantic data center in Richland Parish, Louisiana.Meta said that its employee headcount was 78,450 as of Sept. 30, representing an 8% year-over-year increase.The company in September added Vibes to its Meta AI app. That feature is a feed of AI-generated videos. Since Vibes was released, downloads of Meta AI on both iOS and Android are up 56% month-to-month to a total of 3.9 million downloads as of Oct. 18, according to data provided to CNBC by mobile research firm Appfigures.\"Vibes is an example of a new content type enabled by AI, and I think that there are more opportunities to build many more novel types of content ahead,\" Zuckerberg said.Correction: Analysts expected Meta revenue to come in at $49.41 billion.

Photographer: SeongJoon Cho/Bloomberg via Getty ImagesBloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesAsia-Pacific markets were mixed on Thursday, after U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell indicated that a rate cut in December was far from a \"foregone conclusion.\"The Fed on Wednesday slashed the benchmark federal funds rate by 25 basis points, as expected, to bring it to 3.75%-4%.In Asia, investors will closely watch a meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping — the first in-person meeting between the two leaders in Trump's second term.South Korea's markets will also be in focus after Seoul's chief policy advisor Kim Yong-beom reportedly released details of the trade deal with Washington.South Korea will invest $200 billion in the U.S., with an annual cap of $20 billion a year, while the remaining $150 billion of its $350 billion total pledge announced earlier this year will be used for shipbuilding cooperation, according to local media reports.The Kospi gained 1.37% on open with gains seen in auto and shipbuilding stocks, while the small-cap Kosdaq was down 0.1%.Japan's Nikkei 225 dipped marginally below the flatline on open, while the Topix rose 0.1%.Australia's S&P/ASX 200 started the day down 0.29%.Hong Kong's Hang Seng index was poised to rise as it resumes trading after a holiday holiday. HSI futures were at 26,598, higher than the HSI's last close of 26,346.14.Overnight in the U.S., the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed lower Wednesday after Powell's remarks, having hit a record high earlier in the session.The Dow closed down 0.2% at 47,632.00, while the S&P 500 ended marginally lower at 6,890.59.However, the Nasdaq Composite gained 0.55% to a fresh record close of 23,958.47, propped up by a rise in Nvidia.—CNBC's Sean Conlon and Sarah Min contributed to this report.",

    "body": "Treasury yields gained even after the Federal Reserve cut rates for a second time this year as central bank chief Jerome Powell indicated another easing in December was far from certain.The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield was more than 8 basis points higher at 4.072%. The 2-year Treasury note yield added more than 10 basis points to 3.602%. The 30-year bond yield rose more than 6 basis points to 4.613%.One basis point equals 0.01% and yields and prices move in opposite directions.Rates jumped after Powell said the following: \"In the committee's discussions at this meeting, there were strongly differing views about how to proceed in December. A further reduction in the policy rate at the December meeting is not a foregone conclusion. Far from it.\"These moves come after the Fed cut the benchmark federal funds rate by a quarter percentage point to a range of 3.75% to 4%. This is the second such cut this year. The CME FedWatch Tool showed traders are continuing to price in a 70% chance of another interest rate cut from the central bank at its December meeting.The central bank seemed to slightly upgrade its view of the economy in its statement.\"Available indicators suggest that economic activity has been expanding at a moderate pace. Job gains have slowed this year, and the unemployment rate has edged up but remained low through August; more recent indicators are consistent with these developments,\" the statement read.Michael Pearce, deputy chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economists, believes that the Federal Reserve may take a breather from its rate-cutting cycle in the near term.\"We expect the Fed to slow the pace of cuts from here. Our view is predicated on a stabilization in labor market conditions, which is a difficult call amid the dearth of official data,\" he said. \"Our forecast is for the Fed to remain on pause over coming months and deliver three cuts at a quarterly pace in 2026.\"",

    "body": "Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell speaks during a news conference following a meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee at the Federal Reserve on Oct. 29, 2025 in Washington, DC. Alex Wong | Getty ImagesFederal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said on Wednesday that the artificial intelligence boom is different from the dotcom bubble of the late 1990s.\"This is different in the sense that these companies, the companies that are so highly valued, actually have earnings and stuff like that,\" Powell said, during a news conference following the Fed's two-day policy meeting. AI investments in data centers and chips are also a major source of economic growth, he said. In the dotcom era, numerous companies raced to big valuations before going bankrupt due to hefty losses.Powell didn't name specific vendors, but chipmaker Nvidia has emerged as the world's most valuable company, surpassing $5 trillion in market cap. The rally has been driven by the company's graphics processing units, which are at the heart of AI models and workloads. However, while Nvidia is generating big profits, high-valued startups OpenAI and Anthropic have been burning cash as they develop and expand their services. OpenAI has racked up $1 trillion in AI deals of late, despite being set to generate only $13 billion in annual revenue. Anthropic, which is at a $7 billion revenue run rate, last week announced an estimated $50 billion cloud partnership with Google.WATCH: AI market differs from bubblewatch now",

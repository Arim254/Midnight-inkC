    "body": "Starbucks Workers United demonstrates outside of the Empire State Building as the union's strike enters its third week.CNBC | Amelia LucasNEW YORK — Starbucks Workers United held a rally outside the Empire State Building on Thursday as its open-ended strike entered its third week and no signs of an impending resolution.Adding to the crunch of holiday shoppers and tourists, several hundred picketers gathered outside of the famous landmark, which is also the site of a swanky three-floor Starbucks Reserve location and the company's regional headquarters. Members of other unions, like the AFL-CIO and Service Employees International Union, which is affiliated with Workers United, protested alongside baristas, chanting \"No coffee, no contract\" and \"What's disgusting? Union busting\" between speakers.\"Their fight is a fight really for all of us, to workers across the country, to corporations like Starbucks, across the country that workers are fed up with the status quo, and they're not going to take it anymore,\" SEIU President April Verrett told CNBC.Twelve demonstrators were arrested for blocking the building's entrance.Baristas launched the strike on Starbucks Red Cup Day last month, seeking new proposals from the company that address its top issues to finalize a contract. Those include improved hours, higher wages and the resolution of hundreds of unfair labor practice charges levied against Starbucks. Out of the 145 locations involved in the strike, 55 remain closed, according to a company spokesperson. The two parties have not been in active negotiations to reach a contract after talks between them fell apart late last year. The strikes have not changed that fact so far.While the strike has injected uncertainty into Starbucks' busy holiday season, the company has said its sales haven't been affected. CEO Brian Niccol told employees that Red Cup Day was its strongest in history. A successful holiday season will be key to the chain's turnaround under Niccol. Starbucks broke a nearly two-year streak of same-store sales declines in its most recently reported quarter. Past strikes have impacted less than 1% of its stores, the company said.The New York City rally comes after the company paid $38.9 million to settle violations of the city's Fair Workweek Law. Other large restaurant employers, like Chipotle, have previously run afoul of the law, which Starbucks said is \"notoriously challenging\" to navigate.The city's Department of Consumer and Worker Protection found Starbucks committed half a million violations of the law since 2021. The Fair Workweek law requires regular scheduling week to week, mandates schedules be provided 14 days in advance and says hours cannot be reduced by more than 15% without legitimate business reasons. DCWP Commissioner Vilda Vera Mayuga, who spoke at Thursday's rally, said the timing of the record-breaking settlement with the ongoing strike was coincidental.\"While the NYC laws remain unchanged and complex, our focus hasn't shifted – we're committed to creating the best job in retail and to ensuring our practices follow all laws,\" Starbucks said in a statement.The city's current Mayor Eric Adams and Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani have rallied behind striking workers. Mamdani joined Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., alongside baristas in Brooklyn earlier this week.Both Starbucks and the union have pointed blame at the other for failing to reach a bargaining agreement and maintain they are ready to speak when the other is. The two parties entered into mediation in February, and hundreds of barista delegates voted down the economic package Starbucks proposed in April. The company has said it is investing $500 million to improve the employee experience as part of its \"Back to Starbucks\" strategy. That investment includes upgrading its scheduling technology and adding more baristas to rosters. \"As we've said, 99% of our 17,000 U.S. locations remain open and welcoming customers —including many the union publicly stated would strike but never closed or have since reopened. Regardless of the union's plans, we do not anticipate any meaningful disruption. When the union is ready to return to the bargaining table, we're ready to talk,\" spokesperson Jaci Anderson said in a statement.",

    "body": "Lisa Jackson, senior vice president of environment, policy and social initiatives at Apple Inc., speaks during the TechCrunch Disrupt 2017 in San Francisco, California, U.S., on Tuesday, Sept. 19, 2017. David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesApple's general counsel, Kate Adams, and its vice president for environment, policy, and social initiatives, Lisa Jackson, are retiring from the company, the iPhone maker announced on Thursday. Jennifer Newstead, Meta's chief legal officer, will become Apple's new general counsel in March, and Jackson's government affairs staff will report to her starting late next year, Apple said. The two executives, who both reported to Apple CEO Tim Cook, are the latest members of senior leadership to exit the company. In recent weeks, Apple's head software designer said he was leaving to join Meta, while Apple said its AI chief was retiring, along with its chief operating officer.Adams joined Apple from Honeywell and became general counsel in 2017, and oversaw legal matters including litigation, global security, and the company's privacy initiatives. Under Adams, Apple grappled with rising antitrust scrutiny and regulation around the world, including major lawsuits in the U.S. over the iPhone App Store's restrictions and fees. Jackson joined Apple in 2013, and led the company's diversity programs as well as much of its policy work in Washington, D.C. Before that, she spent four years as administrator of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, a position she was appointed to by President Barack Obama. With her emphasis in areas like social justice and renewable energies, Jackson's job lost relevance during the second Trump administration, which has publicly denounced diversity, equity and inclusion programs and slammed efforts to combat climate change. Apple has faced increased tariffs from the Trump administration, and Cook has met with President Donald Trump several times to tout the company's American manufacturing plans as part of an effort to influence policy. Jackson was instrumental in Apple's launch of its Racial Equity and Justice Initiative following the 2020 murder of George Floyd. She then helped expand the company's equity and justice efforts to other countries, including the U.K., Mexico and New Zealand, according to a report published in 2023.\"At Apple, we pledge that our resolve will not fade,\" Jackson wrote in a section of that report. \"We won't delay action. We will work, each and every day, on the urgent task of advancing equity.\"Jackson also worked on Apple's environmental image. Her job \"focused on reducing greenhouse gases, protecting air and water quality, preventing exposure to toxic contamination, and expanding outreach to communities on environmental issues,\" according to her bio on the company's website. She discussed Apple's plans to become carbon neutral at iPhone launch events.Jackson also accompanied Cook to several official functions in Washington, including state dinners. Apple CEO Tim Cook and Apple Vice President Lisa Jackson arrive at the White House for a state dinner on April 10, 2024 in Washington, DC. Tasos Katopodis | Getty ImagesNewstead, who will become Apple's top lawyer, has overseen Meta's legal and regulatory matters pertaining to its family of apps like Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp since 2019. A Meta spokesperson said Newstead will be staying through the end of the year and that the company is actively searching for her replacement.Prior to Meta, Newstead served as a Trump-appointed legal advisor at the State Department during the president's first administration in 2019.  Before that, she was a partner at Davis Polk & Wardwell and a general counsel of the White House Office of Management and Budget, among other roles in the U.S. government.CNBC's Jonathan Vanian contributed to this story.WATCH: Apple AI chief steps downwatch now",

Cloudflare shares pared some of its losses on the news and were last seen 2% lower.Sites including professional networking platform LinkedIn, digital currency exchange Coinbase and online publishing platform Substack were among those that appeared to be impacted by the issue.Outage monitoring site Downdetector, which itself appeared to be briefly impacted, said users reported a sharp uptick in problems on sites, including e-commerce platform Shopify, HSBC and food delivery group Deliveroo, among others, at around 9:16 a.m. London time. These reports fell as Cloudflare implemented its fix shortly thereafter.The outage comes less than three weeks after a similar Cloudflare crash caused error messages across the internet, an issue that the company said was \"unacceptable\" at the time, given the importance of its services. Cloudflare's software is used by many businesses worldwide, helping to manage and secure traffic for about 20% of the web.

    "body": "Source: Willow WealthAs Yieldstreet tries to distance itself from a rocky past with a new name and ad campaign, its customers are dealing with a present reality that is increasingly dire.The private markets investing startup, freshly rebranded as Willow Wealth, last week informed customers of new defaults on real estate projects in Houston, Texas, and Nashville, Tennessee, CNBC has learned.The letters, obtained and verified by CNBC, account for about $41 million in new losses. They come on the heels of $89 million in marine loan wipeouts disclosed in September and $78 million in losses revealed by CNBC in an August report.In total, Willow Wealth investors have lost at least $208 million, according to CNBC reporting.Willow Wealth also removed a decade of historical performance data from public view in recent weeks. A chart on the company's website showing annualized returns of negative 2% for real estate investments from 2015 to 2025 — down from 9.4% gains just two years prior — has been taken down.\"They had to change their name,\" said Mark Williams, a professor at Boston University's Questrom School of Business. \"Their old name had negative value to it, so they're trying to do a 2.0 to restart things. They're also making it harder to uncover their poor performance by removing the stats, which is alarming.\"The high-stakes rebranding is the latest chapter for a company that sought to empower retail investors, but instead left some of them saddled with deep losses and years of uncertainty.Under its former name, Willow Wealth — backed by prominent venture firms and buoyed by aggressive online marketing — had been the best known of a wave of American startups that promised to broaden access to the alternative investments that are the domain of institutions and rich families.But the still-unfolding collapse of its real estate funds demonstrates the risks the private markets hold for retail investors. By their very nature, private investments don't trade on exchanges and lack standardized disclosures. That leaves investors especially reliant on private fund managers, both for information and to safeguard their interests for years while their money is locked up in deals.Private markets have gained in prominence this year after President Donald Trump signed an executive order to allow the investments in retirement plans.While critics say that opaque, illiquid investments with high management fees aren't appropriate for ordinary investors, asset managers including BlackRock and Apollo Global Management see retail as a vast untapped pool of capital. Retirement giant Empower said in May that it would allow private assets into the 401(k) plans of participating employers with help from firms including Apollo and Goldman Sachs.New mascot, same pitch Against this backdrop, Willow Wealth CEO Mitch Caplan, a former E-Trade chief who took the helm in May, said the company was heading toward a new model. Instead of only offering deals sourced by the startup, it would also sell private market funds from Wall Street giants including Goldman and Carlyle Group.The company no longer provides the historical performance of its offerings because of the pivot to third party-managed funds, according to a person with knowledge of the situation who asked for anonymity to discuss internal strategy.\"Transparency is paramount to us, and we consistently provide strategy-specific performance information for each manager at the offering level to support informed decision making,\" said a Willow Wealth spokeswoman.As for CNBC's reporting on the new real estate defaults and rising tally of losses, the Willow Wealth spokeswoman called it a \"rehash\" of news on \"investments from five years ago.\"\"The investments in question represent a very small portion of our overall portfolio and do not reflect the current nature of our offerings or business focus,\" she said.The firm declined to say how much it manages in assets.The startup — founded in 2015 by Michael Weisz and Milind Mehere, who remain on Willow Wealth's board of directors — told customers that private investments would provide both higher returns and lower volatility than traditional assets.Willow Wealth's pitch hasn't changed much, despite the rebrand.In a new ad campaign, a character called Hampton Dumpty says that he's \"learned a thing or two about crashes\" and therefore uses Willow Wealth to diversify his portfolio with private market assets including real estate.The mascot, a play on the Humpty Dumpty nursery rhyme, tells viewers that \"portfolios including private markets have outperformed traditional ones for the past 20 years.\"Compounding feesOn its revamped website, the firm has a chart showing a hypothetical portfolio made of private equity, private credit and real estate outperforming traditional stocks and bonds over the decade through 2025.But the chart doesn't include the impact of fees, which are typically far higher for private investments than for stock ETFs and mutual funds. The company also notes in a disclosure that customers can't actually invest in the private market indices listed.While most stock ETFs carry fees below 0.2%, Willow Wealth typically charges 10 times more than that, or 2% annually on unreturned funds, for its real estate offerings, according to product documents.Willow Wealth also charged an array of one-time fees associated with the creation of the funds, including for structuring the deal and arranging the loans.Fees for Willow Wealth's new products are even higher. The company charges about 1.4% annually for access to portfolios made up of private funds from Goldman Sachs, Carlyle and the StepStone Group, according to its website.Those firms also charge their own fees, leading to all-in annual costs ranging from about 3.3% to 6.7% per fund, according to the providers' documents.That makes Willow Wealth's products among the most expensive in the retail investing universe.'Difficult news'For customers still coming to terms with their losses and who remain in limbo on funds that the firm says are on \"watchlist\" for possible default, Yieldstreet's transformation into Willow Wealth looks like an effort to evade accountability, the customers told CNBC.After last week's disclosures, nine out of the 30 real estate deals reviewed by CNBC since August are now in default. That 30% failure rate is high, even by the standards of the private assets world, said Boston University's Williams.Though the realm of private credit is more opaque, making average default rates difficult to pinpoint, some in the industry estimate typical failure rates of between 2% and 8%.Whether they were apartments in hot downtown areas or established cities, or single family homes scattered across Southern boomtowns, projects that Willow Wealth put its customers into struggled to hit revenue targets and fell behind on loan payments.Willow Wealth has blamed the failures on the Federal Reserve's interest rate hiking cycle in 2022, which made repaying floating-rate debt harder.Among newly-disclosed defaults are a pair of funds tied to a 268-unit luxury apartment building in East Nashville called Stacks on Main.Investors hoping to earn the advertised 16.4% annual return put a combined $18.2 million into the two funds, according to documents reviewed by CNBC. They later added another $2 million in a member loan meant to stabilize the deal.Stacks on Main apartment complex in Nashville, Tenn.Courtesy: Google Maps\"Your equity investment is expected to incur a full loss\" after selling Stacks on Main on Nov. 25, Willow Wealth told customers in a letter dated that same day. Investors in the member loan will lose up to 60%, the company said.\"We understand this is difficult news to receive,\" Willow Wealth told customers. \"We share in your disappointment.\"Documents for the 2022 transactions listed Nazare Capital, the family office of former WeWork CEO Adam Neumann, as the sponsor for the deal. Real estate sponsors typically source, acquire and manage deals on behalf of investors.In 2022, after his WeWork tenure ended, Neumann founded property startup Flow, which took on some of the real estate deals from his family office.In public comments to news outlets over the past year, representatives from Flow have sought to distance the company from the travails of then-Yieldstreet.But according to the 2022 investment memo, Nazare purchased Stacks on Main in July 2021 for $79 million and then offloaded a majority stake to Yieldstreet members through a joint venture.Crucially, the transaction saddled the joint venture with $62.1 million in debt, a burden which would later prove instrumental in the deal's failure, CNBC found. Israeli-American businessman Adam Neumann speaks during The Israeli American Council (IAC) 8th Annual National Summit on January 19, 2023 in Austin, Texas.Shahar Azran | Getty Images\"This building was majority-owned by YieldStreet and the property was never operated either by Flow or anyone associated with Adam,\" a spokeswoman for Neumann told CNBC. \"In any event, the building has been sold and Flow no longer has a minority interest nor any involvement in this property.\" Nazare was also listed as sponsor for another Nashville project that went sideways for retail investors, an apartment complex at 2010 West End Ave. That project resulted in $35 million in losses across two funds, wipeouts that were previously reported by CNBC.Besides the deals tied to Nazare, there were other defaults.A project called the Houston Multi-Family Equity fund, made up of apartments across suburban Texas, resulted in a loss of all $21 million of customer funds, the startup told investors in a Nov. 25 letter. \"The property was unable to generate sufficient revenue to pay monthly debt service and operating expenses\" and went into foreclosure, resulting in a \"full loss of the equity,\" Willow Wealth said.A 'high-risk' trapThe tally of Willow Wealth's investor losses is likely to rise further.For instance, an $11.6 million loan made by Willow Wealth customers for a Portland, Oregon, multifamily project is \"currently in default\" after an appraisal found that the borrower owed more than the real estate was worth, the company told investors.Willow Wealth is trying to restructure the borrower's loan to avoid selling the property for a loss, the company said in a letter to investors.The company has also warned investors that a Tucson, Arizona, apartment complex and two projects made up of single-family rental homes across Southern states were likely to result in future losses of unspecified amounts, according to separate letters. Investors put more than $63 million combined into those deals.Williams, the Boston University professor and a former Federal Reserve bank examiner, said he taught a class this fall on how Willow Wealth and other fintech firms failed to protect their customers.\"They claimed they were going to democratize access to the types of deals only the rich had,\" Williams said. \"In reality, they created a high-risk trap for investors.\"watch now",

David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesUlta Beauty on Thursday raised its full-year sales outlook after topping Wall Street's fiscal third-quarter expectations and seeing shoppers splurge on perfumes, skincare items and more.The beauty retailer said it now expects net sales for the year to be approximately $12.3 billion, higher than its previous expectations of $12 billion to $12.1 billion. That would would represent an increase from last fiscal year's net sales of $11.3 billion. It expects earnings per share of $25.20 to $25.50, up from its prior expectations of $23.85 to $24.30.It anticipates comparable sales, a metric that includes sales at stores open at least 14 months and e-commerce sales, to rise by 4.4% to 4.7%, up from its prior outlook of 2.5% to 3.5%. Ulta has raised its sales and profit outlook for two consecutive quarters. The company's stock rose more than 6% in extended trading.In a news release, CEO Kecia Steelman said \"exciting assortment newness, improved in-store and digital experiences, and bold marketing efforts are resonating with our guests and drove strong sales results.\"On the company's earnings call, she said that Ulta is \"pleased with our Black Friday and Cyber Monday performance\" and ready for the shopping season — even one when consumers may be more selective about spending.\"Our insights suggest beauty consumers' budgets are tight and they are focused on value,\" she said. \"Despite this, beauty enthusiasts tell us that they spend intend to spend on beauty for seasonal needs, affordable splurges and gifts for loved ones. They are focused on replenishing their essentials and strategically making smart purchases around strong value.\"Here's what the retailer reported for the fiscal third quarter compared with what Wall Street expected, according to LSEG:Earnings per share: $5.14 vs. $4.64 expectedRevenue: $2.86 billion vs. $2.72 billion expectedUlta has benefitted from shoppers who have kept spending on beauty, even as they trim the budget or seek out lower-priced options in other discretionary categories. Yet the company faces stiffer competition from a wide range of rivals, including big-box retailers like Walmart, online players like Amazon and upstarts like TikTok Shop. Beauty sales have been strong overall this year in the U.S., according to data from market research firm Circana. In the first nine months of 2025, prestige beauty sales in terms of dollars rose 4% and mass beauty sales rose 5% year over year.According to Circana, beauty is poised to be a popular category during the holidays, with the market researcher's surveys indicating that more consumers plan to gift beauty products than a year ago, particularly those in households with higher-incomes and those with children.Revenue rose from $2.53 billion in the year-ago quarter.Comparable sales jumped by 6.3% year over year. Shoppers visited Ulta's stores and websites more and spent more during visits. Average ticket rose 3.8% and transactions increased by 2.4% year over year.In the three-month period that ended Nov. 1, Ulta reported net income of $230.9 million, or $5.14 per share, compared with $242.2 million, or $5.14 per share, in the year-ago quarter.Though consumer confidence is weak, Steelman said on Ulta's earnings call that \"beauty engagement remained healthy.\" She said sales of both mass and prestige beauty items grew by mid single-digits year over year.Fragrance was its strongest category in the quarter, with double-digit sales growth year over year, as shoppers bought luxury scents from Valentino and Dolce & Gabbana and also lower-priced scents like Squishmallows perfumes.Steelman said that in October, Ulta added more shelf space for fragrance in more than 60% of its U.S. stores to try to get ready for higher demand during the holidays and beyond.In skincare, the retailer's second-fastest growing category, sales grew by high single digits year over year, she said. Shoppers bought items they discovered on social media, including Korean or K-beauty brands and purchased merchandise from Rihanna's Fenty Skin Body collection, which launched in the fall.To drive growth, Ulta has also been expanding internationally and launched a third-party marketplace in October. In July, it announced it had acquired Space NK, a British beauty retailer, from Manzanita Capital. The deal allows Ulta to enter a new international market, since Space NK has 83 stores in the United Kingdom and Ireland.During the third quarter, Ulta opened seven stores in Mexico through its joint venture partnership with Grupo Bakso. It opened its first Ulta store in the Middle East in Kuwait last month through a franchise partnership with Al-Shabaab.Through its marketplace, Ulta has added more than 120 brands and over 3,500 unique items to its online assortment, Steelman said. She said the company is \"pleased with the initial performance and optimistic about how this new capability can help us strengthen our existing category, attract new guests, and capitalize on incremental growth opportunities in new subcategories,\" such as wellness. Higher tariffs have influenced some of the prices of items carried by Ulta, too. The company saw more brand-driven price increases in the third quarter than the second quarter, interim Chief Financial Officer Chris Lialios said. Sales in the haircare category grew by mid single-digits, despite a sales decline in personal styling tools that have felt pressure from tariff-related price increases, Steelman said.Ulta announced in October that Christopher DelOrefice, the chief financial officer of medical technology company Becton Dickinson & Company, will become its new CFO. He will start in the role on Dec. 5.As of Thursday's close, Ulta's shares have risen about 23% so far this year. That surpasses the S&P 500's nearly 17% gains during the same period.",

    "body": "The Reserve Bank of India logo outside its headquarters in Mumbai on Feb. 7, 2025. Indranil Mukherjee | Afp | Getty ImagesIndia's central bank on Friday cut its policy rate by 25 basis points to 5.25%, matching forecasts from economists polled by Reuters. The monetary policy committee delivered a unanimous reduction, citing \"weakness in some key economic indicators,\" even as headline inflation has eased significantly and is expected to be revised lower in the first quarter of 2025, said RBI governor Sanjay Malhotra.The economy expanded 8.2% from July to September, outpacing expectations, while inflation remains subdued.\"Despite an unfavorable and challenging external environment, the Indian economy has shown remarkable resilience,\" Malhotra said, noting signs of \"high growth.\"\"The headroom provided by the inflation outlook has allowed us to remain growth supportive. We will continue to meet productive requirements of the economy in a proactive manner,\" he said in his closing remarks.Rupee weaknessThe central bank on Friday said it will buy 1 trillion rupees ($11 billion) of government bonds on the open market and carry out a three-year, $5 billion buy-sell swap of the U.S. dollar and the Indian rupee this month.These steps will \"ensure adequate durable liquidity in the system and further facilitate monetary transmission\", Malhotra said.The RBI routinely carries out dollar-rupee swaps to offset the liquidity effects of its spot market interventions on the rupee. The Indian rupee has weakened against the dollar in recent days, slipping past the important 90-rupee-per-dollar level on Wednesday before paring losses.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconIndia's foreign exchange reserves on Nov. 28 stood at $686.2 billion, providing more than 11 months of import cover, the central bank said in a statement.Today's rate cut is \"timely\" given that the economy is doing well, but the outlook remains uncertain, said Anubhuti Sahay, head of India economics research at Standard Chartered Bank. She added that the rate cut is even more significant given the rupee's weakness.Given the sharp moves in the exchange rate, had the RBI not delivered a rate cut today, \"one couldn't have ruled out the possibility of a sell-off in the bond market,\" Sahay added, which would not have been desirable from the RBI's point of view.Weak data, strong growthRBI's Malhotra, explaining the rationale for keeping rates unchanged at the last policy meeting in October, warned that although inflation moderated significantly in the first quarter, growth could still slow in the second half of the financial year due to global trade uncertainties.Concerns about the slowdown in growth are showing up in key economic indicators. Industrial activity in October fell to a 14-month low, and indicators such as HSBC's manufacturing PMI fell to a nine-month low in November, suggesting an economic slowdown.Exports to the U.S., one of India's major trading partners, fell for a second straight month in October, sliding 8.5% from a year earlier to $6.3 billion. Overall outbound shipments in October also fell 11.8% to $34.38 billion.\"External uncertainties continue to pose downside risks to the [growth] outlook, while speedy conclusion of various ongoing trade and investment negotiations present upside potential,\" the governor said.watch nowWashington has imposed a 50% tariff on Indian goods since August. While trade negotiations are ongoing between the two countries, a deal has yet to be finalized.To offset the impact of the tariffs, New Delhi cut goods and services tax rates in September ahead of a month-long festive season to lift domestic demand. GST tax collections showed a sharp improvement in October to 1.95 trillion rupees ($21.7 billion), up 4.6% from a year earlier, but the growth was muted in November with gross collection of 1.7 trillion rupees, a modest 0.7% increase.The Indian rupee has weakened against the dollar in recent days, slipping past the important 90-rupee-per-dollar level on Wednesday before paring losses.Despite a policy rate cut earlier this year, there has not been a \"major pick up in bank lending,\" said Sanjay Mathur, ANZ's Chief Economist for India and Southeast Asia. He added that while there is also no clarity on the conclusion of a U.S.-India trade deal, the impact of tariffs is visible on the economy. ",

Grigory Sysoev | Via ReutersRussian President Vladimir Putin has underlined Moscow's willingness to provide \"uninterrupted shipments of fuel\" to India, as the U.S. pressures New Delhi to give up importing their oil. Putin made the offer during a joint address with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday, part of his first visit to the country since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, which triggered widespread sanctions.The sanctions forced Russia to seek new customers for its exports. India has become the second biggest buyer of Russian crude oil, after China, with a report Finland-based Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air showing India bought 38% of Russian crude exports in October.In October, President Donald Trump sanctioned two of Russia's largest oil companies, Rosneft and Lukoil. This followed a tariff of 25% on India for buying Russian oil in August. But India has to walk a tightrope because it has close ties to the U.S. while also relying on Russia for fuel and access to military hardware.Putin questioned U.S. pressure on India in an interview to an Indian television channel on Thursday.The United States still buys nuclear fuel from Russia for its own nuclear power plants, Putin said in the interview, adding: \"If the U.S. has the right to buy our fuel, why shouldn't India have the same privilege?\" While Trump has acknowledged that India has cut back its Russian oil imports, experts told CNBC that this may be a temporary trend. watch nowApart from crude oil, Russia's Rosatom is also delivering reactors and reportedly fuel for India's Kudankulam nuclear power plant in Tamil Nadu, which has a combined capacity of 6000MW. India and Russia have an energy partnership, the Russian president said, adding that Moscow had been is reliable supplier of \"oil, gas, coal and everything that is required for the development of India's energy\".Last month, India announced a \"historic deal\" with Washington, in which Indian state-owned oil companies signed a one-year deal to import around 2.2 million tonnes per annum of liquefied petroleum gas from the U.S.",

Cfoto | Future Publishing | Getty ImagesShares of Moore Threads, a Beijing-based graphics processing unit (GPU) manufacturer often referred to as \"China's Nvidia,\" soared by more than 400% on its debut in Shanghai following its $1.1 billion listing.The stock closed at 600.500 yuan, over five times its IPO price of 114.28 yuan.Moore Threads' IPO was led by CITIC Securities, which served as the lead underwriter for the offering. The joint book runners on the deal were BOC International Securities, China Merchants Securities, and GF Securities.The company, which is not yet profitable, said in its listing that the IPO proceeds are needed to accelerate several core research and development initiatives, including new-generation self-developed AI training and inference GPU chips. A portion of the funds will also be used to supplement working capital.Moore Thread's successful IPO comes despite it being placed under U.S. sanctions in 2023, which limited its access to advanced chip manufacturing processes and foundries.The firm is representative of a growing cast of Chinese companies developing AI processors amid Beijing's efforts to reduce reliance on American chip designer Nvidia.Other companies in the space include tech giants like Huawei, as well as more specialized players like Cambricon — a firm whose shares on the Shanghai exchange have surged more than 100% year to date.Washington has maintained varying export restrictions on Nvidia for years, preventing it from selling its most advanced AI chips to China. More recently, Beijing has also stepped in to block imports of Nvidia's chips as it tries to encourage domestic alternatives like Moore Threads.Newer players like Enflame Technology and Biren Technology have also entered the space, aiming to capture a share of the billions in GPU demand no longer served by Nvidia. Chinese regulators have also been clearing more semiconductor IPOs in their drive for greater AI independence.watch now",

    "body": "The FBI on Thursday morning arrested a suspect accused of planting pipe bombs outside the Republican and Democratic party headquarters in Washington, D.C., prior to the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riot, the Trump administration said.The suspect, Brian Cole Jr., a 30-year-old resident of Woodbridge, Virginia, is charged with \"use of an explosive device,\" U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi said at a press briefing Thursday afternoon.The investigation is ongoing and more charges could be filed, Bondi noted, adding that search warrants are currently being executed.A criminal complaint unsealed after the briefing shows Cole facing a charge of transporting an explosive device in interstate commerce with intent to kill, injure or intimidate or unlawfully destroy property. Cole is also charged with \"malicious destruction or attempted malicious destruction by means of fire and explosive materials.\"A surveillance photo released by the FBI shows a person in Washington, U.S., January 6, 2021. The FBI issued a notice, which features this surveillance photo, requesting information on person(s) responsible for pipe bombs left at the Republican National Committee (RNC) and Democratic National Committee (DNC) headquarters.FBI | ReutersThe arrest is a massive breakthrough in the nearly five-year federal investigation into who placed the bombs, which did not detonate. The devices were planted on the evening of Jan. 5 and discovered around 1 p.m. ET the next day.\"An individual who is now alleged to have placed multiple explosive devices to blow up multiple people and multiple officials [and] innocent civilians is now arrested,\" FBI Director Kash Patel said at the press briefing.MS NOW, which reported the arrest earlier Thursday morning, said police have not yet determined a motive, citing a law enforcement official.But two people briefed on the arrest told MS NOW that the suspect has been linked to statements that show support for an anarchist ideology.Bondi, asked about Cole's motivations at the briefing, would only say that the DOJ's probe is ongoing.Prince William County Police block the street near the house where the FBI made an arrest, in Woodbridge, Va., Thursday, Dec. 4, 2025.Steve Helber | APCole is described as a five-foot-six-inch-tall man who \"wears corrective eyeglasses,\" an unnamed FBI special agent wrote in an affidavit in support of the criminal complaint.He lives with his mother and other family members and \"works in the office of a bail bondsman in northern Virginia,\" the agent wrote.In 2019 and 2020, Cole allegedly bought items that matched the components used to manufacture the pipe bombs, the FBI discovered after obtaining records for his checking account and three of his six credit cards.The agent said those items included: one-inch-by-eight-inch galvanized pipes; black and galvanized \"end caps,\" which were used to seal the pipes; nine-volt battery connectors; white kitchen timers; and 14-gauge red and black electrical wire.The FBI also obtained phone records that showed Cole's cellphone in the area near the Democratic and Republican National Committee buildings on Jan. 5, 2021, according to the affidavit.The same evening, Cole's 2017 Nissan Sentra was observed driving past a license plate reader in D.C. less than half a mile from the spot where the suspect was first observed on foot, the special agent wrote.FBI Director Kash Patel speaks during a news conference on the January 6th pipe bomber at the Department of Justice on December 4, 2025 in Washington, DC.Andrew Harnik | Getty ImagesThe discoveries that led to the arrest did not come from new evidence, but rather from the same trove of material that had mostly been gathered in 2021 and 2022, two sources told MS NOW.That means the suspect could feasibly have been arrested years earlier — a fact that could cause embarrassment for the FBI, those sources said.Patel, at Thursday's presser, touted that the FBI under his leadership \"did not discover any new information.\"The agency instead \"reexamined every piece of evidence, sifted through all the data,\" Patel said, claiming that was \"something that the prior administration refused and failed to do.\"As recently as late October, the bureau was offering a $500,000 reward for information that would help authorities identify the Capitol Hill bombing suspect.A suspect in the planting of explosive devices near the Democratic and Republican committee headquarters in Washington is seen walking past the Capitol Hill Club, also known as the National Republican Club of Capitol Hill, in Washington in this still frame taken from video released on March 9, 2021. Handout | ReutersSurveillance video released by the FBI shows that around 7:54 p.m. ET on Jan. 5, 2021, a person wearing a face mask, black gloves and a gray hoodie placed a bomb outside the DNC building.About 22 minutes later, the same person appeared to place a second bomb by the RNC's offices, according to the footage.The devices were planted hours before a mob of President Donald Trump's supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol as lawmakers prepared to confirm former President Joe Biden's 2020 election win.Nearly 1,600 people were criminally charged in connection with that riot. Trump, in one of his first acts after retaking the White House in January, pardoned the vast majority of them.When NBC News asked the White House how the administration reconciles its efforts to arrest Cole with Trump's mass pardons for others who committed crimes — some violent in nature — on Jan. 6, a spokesperson called the comparison \"alarming and insulting.\"A poster is displayed during a press conference with Attorney General Pam Bondi and FBI Director Kash Patel about the January 6th pipe bomber at the Department of Justice on December 4, 2025 in Washington, DC. Andrew Harnik | Getty ImagesThe timing of the pipe-bomb placement, and the elusiveness of the perpetrator, have made the case a hotbed of conspiracy theories.Last month, a conservative news site named a former U.S. Capitol Police officer as a possible match for the pipe bomber, based largely on a \"gait analysis.\" The FBI poured cold water on the story, and the accused officer cleared her name by providing a video of her playing with her puppies at the time the bombs were placed, CBS News reported.The yearslong investigation was a priority for the FBI, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, the D.C.

    "body": "U.S. Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. looks on as he attends a press conference to discuss health insurance reform, at the Department of Health and Human Services in Washington, D.C., U.S., June 23, 2025.Kevin Mohatt | ReutersHealth and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s hand-picked vaccine committee on Thursday deferred crucial votes on hepatitis B vaccines for babies until Friday, saying it will give members more time to review proposed language on the measure. One panel member, Dr. Cody Meissner, a professor of pediatrics at the Dartmouth Geisel School of Medicine, brought a motion to defer the votes following confusion amongst the group about the language. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention currently recommends that every baby get vaccinated against hepatitis B within 24 hours of birth. It's unclear if the panel, called the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, or ACIP, could significantly delay or eliminate a so-called birth dose of the shot for babies whose mothers test negative for the virus. The group tabled a vote on the vaccine in September because some members called for a more robust discussion first.But any change could have wide-ranging consequences: Some public health experts say that having fewer newborns vaccinated against the virus could risk an increase in chronic infections among children. Hepatitis B, which can be passed from mother to baby during childbirth, can lead to liver disease and early death. There is no cure. \"We have a vaccine that is highly effective at preventing an incurable disease. We should take full advantage of that,\" Neil Maniar, a public health professor at Northeastern University, told CNBC. The birth dose recommendation was introduced in 1991 and is credited with driving down infections in kids by 99% since then. Maniar called that a \"remarkable success story that we run the risk of reversing\" if the committee changes the recommendation. Decisions by the panel are not legally binding, as it is up to states to mandate immunizations. But ACIP's recommendations have significant implications for whether private insurance plans and government assistance programs cover the vaccines at no cost for eligible children. The panel's upcoming two-day meeting in Atlanta comes after Kennedy earlier this year gutted the committee and appointed 12 new members, including some well-known vaccine critics. During the meeting in September, some advisors raised questions about whether the benefits of the shot outweigh potential safety risks. But the jab is \"an incredibly safe vaccine with minimal risks,\" Dr. Sean O'Leary, chair of the American Academy of Pediatrics' Committee on Infectious Diseases, said during a media briefing Tuesday. \"I never once saw a fever actually associated with hepatitis B vaccine,\" said O'Leary, who practiced for eight years as a general pediatrician and worked in a newborn nursery. The AAP, which publishes its own vaccine schedule, still recommends the universal birth dose of the hepatitis B vaccine because \"it saves lives,\" he added. A new review, published Tuesday, of more than 400 studies spanning four decades also found no evidence that delaying the universal hepatitis B vaccine birth dose improves safety or effectiveness. The review also found that the birth dose does not cause any short- or long-term serious adverse events or deaths.A 2024 CDC study showed that the current vaccination schedule has helped prevent more than 6 million hepatitis B infections and nearly 1 million hepatitis B-related hospitalizations.Merck and GSK manufacture the hepatitis B vaccines used starting at birth. Neither of the shots are significant revenue drivers for the companies. But John Grabenstein, a former Merck vaccine executive and military pharmacist, said a change to the recommendation could cause vaccine supply disruptions for the companies. \"They have build up their reserves, and they build up their thorough calculations so that they can meet the status quo,\" Grabenstein, who has no remaining financial ties to Merck, told CNBC. \"If you disrupt the status quo without warning, then there would be too much of some things and not enough of other things that could easily create spot shortages.\" Still, he said his first concern from a public health standpoint is that fewer children will get vaccinated on time, leaving them vulnerable to infection. Merck during the panel's September meeting also pushed back on changing the recommendation. \"The reconsideration of the newborn Hepatitis B vaccination on the established schedule poses a grave risk to the health of children and to the public, which could lead to a resurgence of preventable infectious diseases,\" Dr. Richard Haupt, Merck's head of global medical and scientific affairs for vaccines and infectious diseases, said at the time. ",

    "body": "Signage outside Applied Materials headquarters in Santa Clara, California, U.S., on Thursday, May 13, 2021. David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesChip equipment manufacturer Applied Materials is laying off 4% of its workforce.The company on Thursday began notifying impacted employees around the world \"across all levels and groups,\" it said in a filing. Applied Materials provides equipment, services and software to industries, including the semiconductor industry.Applied Materials had approximately 36,100 full-time employees, according to an August 2025 filing. A layoff of 4% would represent about 1,444 employees.\"Automation, digitalization and geographic shifts are redefining our workforce needs and skill requirements,\" the company wrote in the filing. \"With this in mind, we have been focused for some time on building high-velocity, high-productivity teams, adopting new technologies and simplifying organizational structures.\"The move comes at the end of the company's fiscal year. Earlier this month, the Applied Materials forecasted a $600 million hit to fiscal 2026 revenue after the U.S. expanded its restricted export list. That resulted in company shares to dipping 3% in extended trading.As a result of the workforce reduction, Applied Materials expects to incur charges of approximately $160 million to $180 million, consisting primarily of severance and other one-time employment termination benefits to be paid in cash, the filing states.The company said the cuts are a way to position itself \"as a more competitive and productive organization.\"",

    "body": "Workers at a factory in Houston, Texas build servers for Apple.AppleApple has started shipping advanced servers for artificial intelligence applications out of a factory in Houston, Texas, the company announced on Thursday.These servers are a core part of Apple's commitment to spend $600 billion in the U.S. on advanced manufacturing, suppliers, and other initiatives, and the milestone could please President Donald Trump, who has called for Apple and other technology companies to do more manufacturing on U.S. shores.Apple's plan to assemble servers in the U.S. was first revealed in February. Apple Chief Operating Officer Sabih Khan said on Thursday that the servers will power the company's Apple Intelligence and Private Cloud Compute services. Apple is using its own silicon in its Apple Intelligence servers.\"Our teams have done an incredible job accelerating work to get the new Houston factory up and running ahead of schedule and we plan to continue expanding the facility to increase production next year,\" Khan said in a statement.The Houston factory is on track to create thousands of jobs, Apple said.

Cook gave Trump a gift based on the U.S.-made Corning glass used on iPhones and Apple Watches.Apple also opened a manufacturing academy in partnership with Michigan State in July.While Trump has praised Cook and Apple for its U.S. spending commitments, he has also at times pushed Apple to make its iPhones in the U.S., a process that experts say could take years and would be costly.The Trump administration has separately called for and cancelled tariffs that could hurt Apple, which imports its computers and phones to the U.S. from China, India, and Vietnam.In September, Cook said in a CNBC interview that Apple is contributing to U.S. manufacturing by doing business with U.S.-based semiconductor suppliers, and that its spending and expertise is enabling chips to be fabricated and packaged entirely in the U.S.\"You can add a lot by making it global and then stitching together the end-to-end supply chain in semiconductors,\" Cook said. \"I can't stress how important this is and how much that will add to what we're doing.\"A factory building Apple servers for AI in Texas",

Salwan Georges | The Washington Post | Getty ImagesBig Tech and other publicly traded companies are helping to finance the $300 million White House ballroom planned by President Donald Trump.The White House East Wing has been demolished to make room for the 90,000 square foot ballroom, sparking public anger after Trump promised in July that the building would not be impacted.Trump has said the construction of the ballroom will be financed by his own funds and corporate and individual donors at no cost to the taxpayer. The president said Wednesday the project will cost $300 million, up from an initial estimate of $200 million.Trump has not said how much he is spending. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters on Thursday that the president will disclose his contribution.The White House has released a list of donors that include Amazon, Alphabet, Apple, Microsoft and Meta.Alphabet is contributing $22 million which represents about 7% of the project's estimated cost. Its contribution is the result of a settlement reached with Trump last month over a lawsuit he filed against YouTube for banning him from the platform after a riot by his supporters against Congress on Jan. 6, 2021.The settlement notes that $22 million will be contributed on Trump's behalf \"to the Trust for the National Mall, a 501(c)(3) tax-exempt entity dedicated to restoring, preserving, and elevating the National Mall, to support the construction of the White House State Ballroom.\"Donors also include Palantir, Micron, Coinbase, Lockheed Martin, Continental Resources founder Harold Hamm, and Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, according to the White House list.\"Lockheed Martin is grateful for the opportunity to help bring the President's vision to reality and make this addition to the People's House, a powerful symbol of the American ideals we work to defend every day,\" a company spokesperson said in a statement.Comcast, CNBC's current parent company, is also on the donor list.

    "body": "A Rivian R1S electric vehicle (EV) at a dealership and service center in San Francisco, California, US, on Tuesday, June 3, 2025. David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesDETROIT – Rivian Automotive is laying off roughly 4.5% of its workforce as the all-electric vehicle maker faces growing market challenges, according to a note sent to employees Thursday and viewed by CNBC.In the message, Rivian founder and CEO RJ Scaringe said the cuts largely involved restructurings of its marketing, vehicle operations and sales/delivery and mobile operations teams.\"These are not changes that were made lightly. With the changing operating backdrop, we had to rethink how we are scaling our go-to-market functions. This news is challenging to hear, and the hard work and contributions of the team members who are leaving are greatly appreciated,\" Scaringe said.Rivian had just under 15,000 employees at the end of last year.The note did not specify how many employees would be laid off. The Wall Street Journal, which first reported the plans, said the layoffs would affect more than 600 workers, which a source familiar with the plans confirmed to CNBC. The person spoke anonymously because the news had not yet been made public.Rivian and other EV manufacturers are increasingly facing a more challenging market than they did in recent years amid changing regulations under the Trump administration, including the elimination of a $7,500 federal incentive for purchasing an EV.Aside from regulatory issues, Rivian also faces slower-than-expected EV demand and a lack of new products until next year amid needs for cash and earnings losses. The company lost $1.1 billion during the second quarter.Scaringe, in the Thursday note, said the changes will ensure the company \"can deliver on our potential by scaling efficiently towards building a healthy and profitable business,\" as it prepares to launch its new R2 models, which are expected to begin production next year.Rivian's vehicle sales increased 32% to 13,201 units year over year during the third quarter as buyers hurried to purchase an EV before the federal incentives expired at the end of September, but the company's 2025 delivery forecast was narrowed from as many as 46,000 units to between 41,500 and 43,500 vehicles.In August, Rivian also flagged a bigger adjusted core loss this year, expecting it to between $2 billion and $2.25 billion, compared with $1.7 billion to $1.9 billion previously forecast.Shares of Rivian closed Thursday at $13.09, up 1.3%. The stock is off less than 2% this year.",

CNBC confirmed the contents of that story. Meta's risk organization is tasked with assessing and documenting various product and feature risks and ensure that the company is complying with regulators worldwide. The organization was established after the company formerly known as Facebook was slapped with a $5 billion fine by the Federal Trade Commission as part of a settlement that also required that the social media giant restructure its approach to privacy.The job reductions come amid broader organizational restructurings at Meta, including its decision on Wednesday to lay off about 600 employees who work in the company's Superintelligence Labs AI unit. The cuts, however, did not impact Meta's top-tier TBD Labs division within the AI unit.\"Through our product risk and compliance team, we've built one of the most sophisticated compliance programs in the industry to help us evaluate our products and features,\" a Meta spokesperson said in a statement. \"We routinely make organizational changes and are restructuring our team to reflect the maturity of our program and innovate faster while maintaining high compliance standards.\"Meta promoted Protti to lead the company's privacy program in 2019 following the settlement with the FTC related to the company's Cambridge Analytica data privacy scandal.The social media company has spent the past year developing AI technology to streamline risk management. The Meta spokesperson said that the company's revamped risk management system relies on more basic automation rather than more bleeding-edge AI technologies that can generate compelling text based on written prompts.Meta Vice President of Policy Rob Sherman said in a June LinkedIn post that the company \"built a tool that helps teams automatically identify when legal and policy requirements apply to specific products.\"\"We're not using AI to make decisions on risk,\" Sherman wrote. \"Instead, the rules are applied using automation, reducing time experts need to spend on the ratified decisions, while increasing reliability because there's less room for human error.\"Other companies are also increasingly pointing to the use of AI technologies to reduce their workforce.Major banks like JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs are pitching AI projects to bolster profitability while slowing headcount growth. JPMorgan finance chief Jeremy Barnum told analysts during the firm's most recent earnings report that bank managers have been directed to avoid hiring people amid a broader AI rollout, CNBC reported last week.Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff said in September that his software vendor would cut 4,000 customer support roles because of AI's growing capabilities and the \"benefits and efficiencies\" of the company's Agentforce software. \"We've seen the number of support cases we handle decline and we no longer need to actively backfill support engineer roles,\" Salesforce said in a statement at the time.WATCH: A rotation out of the US is a bet against the AI trade.watch now",

Panther Lake is the first client system-on-chips (SoCs) built on the Intel 18A process node.Courtesy: IntelIntel reported better-than-expected revenue on Thursday, signaling that demand for its core x86 processors for PCs has recovered. The stock jumped 6% in extended trading.Here's how Intel did in the third quarter versus LSEG consensus estimates:Revenue: $13.65 billion versus $13.14 billion estimatedEPS: 23 cents, adjusted, not comparable to analyst estimatesIntel recorded a per-share loss of 37 cents in the quarter to account for shares in escrow that will be released to the U.S. government as part of its $8.9 billion investment. The Trump administration negotiated the investment in August, purchasing 433.3 million shares at $20.47 per share.The chipmaker said it expects revenue in the fourth quarter of $13.3 billion at the midpoint, with adjusted earnings per share of 8 cents. Analysts expected $13.37 billion in revenue and earnings of 8 cents per share. Intel said its outlook excludes the impact from a recent sale of its Altera subsidiary.For the third quarter, Intel reported net income of $4.1 billion, or 90 cents per share, versus a net loss in the year-ago quarter of $16.6 billion. Intel said it received $5.7 billion from the U.S. government during the quarter.\"There is limited precedent for the accounting treatment of such transactions,\" Intel warned investors in its press release.Intel said that it met with the Securities and Exchange Commission to gain approval for its approach to accounting for the government's stake, but it doesn't yet have an answer because of the shutdown. The company warned that it may revise its results in the future.\"We are fully committed to advancing the Trump administration's vision to restore semiconductor production and proudly welcome the US government as a essential partner in our efforts,\" Tan told investors on an earnings call.The company also took a $5 billion in investment from one-time rival Nvidia in September. As part of that deal, the two companies will integrate Intel's central processors (CPUs) alongside Nvidia's artificial intelligence graphics processors, which currently make up 90% of the AI chip market.Intel said that demand for its chips outpaced supply, a trend that it expects to continue through next year.The company said that its products group reported $12.7 billion in sales, up 3% on an annual basis. Of that, $8.5 billion was from its Client Computing Group, which includes chips for PCs and laptops. Another $4.1 billion in sales were for data center CPUs, which were down 1% on a year-over-year basis. Intel said it hopes that its deal with Nvidia can help revive growth in its data center CPU business.Investors are focused on the future of Intel Foundry, which manufactures chips for other companies, not just Intel's. The division requires $100 billion in capital investment, and it's yet to secure a major customer. Intel said it started production of its most advanced chips in Arizona during the quarter.Intel's foundry reported $4.2 billion in sales during the quarter, down 2% on an annual basis. The entirety of the revenue was from Intel using the foundry to build its chips, the company said.The company said it had 88,400 employees, down from 124,100 at the same time last year.Correction: A prior version of this story had an incorrect employee count.WATCH: Cramer's Mad Dash: Intelwatch now",

Gina Ferazzi | Los Angeles Times | Getty ImagesA new bombshell indictment criminally charging former NBA player Damon Jones suggests that while affiliated with the Los Angeles Lakers, Jones leaked information about the injury status of superstar LeBron James to sports bettors before a February 2023 game.The same indictment suggests Jones leaked information to bettors about the playing status of then-Lakers star Anthony Davis before a January 2024 game against the Oklahoma City Thunder.The indictment said that Jones told a co-defendant that a star Laker identified only as Player 4 was \"probable\" for that game. Davis was the only player listed as \"probable\" for that game, according to records.One of those bettors who received the information then placed a bet of approximately $100,000 against the Lakers, who ended up winning the game, with Davis playing up to his usual standards.Neither James nor Davis. who now plays with the Dallas Mavericks, is accused of wrongdoing in the federal indictment unsealed Thursday in U.S. District Court in Brooklyn, New York.Jones, 49, Miami Heat player Terry Rozier, and four other men are charged with defrauding betting companies and conspiracy to commit money laundering in the case.Jones and James previously played together on the Cleveland Cavaliers. Jones was acting as an unofficial coach for the Lakers at the time of the February 2023 game in Los Angeles that is mentioned in the indictment.A James spokesman declined to comment to CNBC.

[Player 3] is out tonight. Bet enough so Djones can eat ... now!\"\"At the time Jones provided this non-public information about Player 3 to Co-Conspirator 9, Player 3 was not ruled out on the NBA's injury report for the\" game, the indictment says.James ended up sitting out that Feb. 9 game with a lower-body injury, to his ankleThe indictment says, \"Due to a lower body injury, Player 3 did not play in the February 9 Game.\"The only other active Laker player to sit out that game with an injury was Scotty Pippen Jr., who did not have a lower-body injury. Pippen was in the concussion protocol for the game.Milwaukee defeated the Lakers in that game by a score of 115 to 106.The Bucks went into the game as a favorite by an average of 8 points, according to various odds sites.A person familiar with James' situation said James did not know his information would be used for betting.Coach Damon Jones looks on during the game during the 2025 G League Elite Camp on May 11, 2025 at Windtrust Arena in Chicago, Illinois.Jeff Haynes | National Basketball Association | Getty ImagesOther wording in the indictment suggests that Davis is the person identified only as Player 4, who the charging document says was \"one of the best Lakers' players during the 2023-2024 season.\"Before a Jan. 15, 2024, Lakers game at home against the Thunder, Jones \"claimed to have learned from the trainer for Players 3 and 4 that Player 4 was injured and only going to play a limited number of minutes and/or his performance would likely be affected in the game because of the injury,\" the indictment says.Jones then allegedly shared that non-public information with his co-defendant, Eric Earnest, \"who then sent a text message to the defendant Marves Fairley, stating, \"Hit me asap gone one for u dude say he got some info.\"Earnest then allegedly shared information about Player 4 with Fairley, who in turn shared the information with two other people, according to the indictment. Fairley, who paid Jones $2,500 for the tip, and a co-conspirator then placed multiple bets against the Lakers, with Fairley putting down about $100,000, the indictment alleges.Anthony Davis #3 of the Los Angeles Lakers shoots a free throw during the game against the Charlotte Hornets on Jan. 27, 2025 at Spectrum Center in Charlotte, North Carolina.

    "body": "A shopper looks at produce at a grocery store in West Milton, Ohio, US, on Tuesday, Oct. 21, 2025. Kyle Grillot | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesThe Friday release of September's consumer price index report is pretty much the only game in town this month for a Wall Street that is hungry for data, raising the chances for it to be a market-moving event.While the actual numbers are expecting to land about where they've been in recent months, the dearth of official economic reports, thanks to the government shutdown, means even a slight deviation could cause an outsized impact.\"Because we haven't gotten any government data in the recent past, I think all of the market's focus and all of the market's attention is going to be directed onto this one report,\" said Troy Ludtka, senior U.S. economist at SMBC Nikko Securities. \"This is going to be the report to end all reports.\"As far as the Wall Street consensus goes, though, the CPI release from the Bureau of Labor Statistics looks to be more of the same.Economists surveyed by Dow Jones expect the monthly all-items reading to increase by 0.4%, the same as a month ago, putting the 12-month inflation rate at 3.1%, or 0.2 percentage point higher than the August level. Excluding food and energy, core CPI is projected to show a 0.3% monthly increase and a 3.1% annual level, both the same as in August. The yearly rate would be the highest since January.What the Street will be looking for is any deviation in the readings showing that inflation is running hotter or colder than anticipated. The focus also will be on the details showing what impact President Donald Trump's tariffs are having on prices.The report, which was supposed to be released Oct. 15, will be the last significant economic reading before the Fed's policy meeting that concludes Wednesday. The BLS called workers back because it uses CPI as a benchmark for Social Security cost of living adjustments.Lack of clarityGoldman Sachs economists expect little change on auto prices, a boost on car insurance and a decline in airfare. On the tariff issue, the firm said in a note that it expects \"upward pressure\" on categories such as communication, household furnishings and recreation, but an addition of just 0.07 percentage point to the core inflation figure.However, data in general is a black box with so much of the government shut down, raising some questions over the reliability of the CPI.\"We don't have full clear clarity with the lack of important data points that the market depends on due to the government shutdown,\" said Vishal Khanduja, head of broad markets fixed income at Morgan Stanley Investment Management. \"So that adds to the uncertainty a little bit more.\"Indeed, investors have been on tenterhooks lately, pushing major stock market averages to around record territory despite continued fluctuation in day-to-day moves.Geopolitical uncertainty is at the root of concerns, with the ever-shifting tariff landscape injecting worry that higher prices could slow what has been an otherwise surprisingly strong pace of economic growth. The CPI report, despite concerns about how clean the data will be due to shutdown-related disruptions, should help answer at least some of those questions.That applies both to markets and the Federal Reserve, which holds a policy meeting next week at which officials are widely expected to approve another quarter percentage point interest rate cut.\"In terms of market impact, it would take a meaningful surprise to the upside for the market to change its mind about an additional interest rate cut,\" said Julien Lafargue, chief market strategist at Barclays Private Bank.Outside of the trade war's frequent gyrations, markets have been boosted by another strong earnings season. Prior to the lockdown, economic data also had shown a surprisingly resilient economy, with gross domestic product tracking close to 4% for the third quarter, according to the Atlanta Fed.While it would take something of consequent to shake that narrative, a surprise from CPI might just be the ticket.\"I would expect volatility if the number comes in higher than expected,\" said Stephanie Link, chief investment strategist at Hightower Advisors. \"I would view that as a buying opportunity as the economy is strong, the Fed is beginning a cutting cycle, EPS are growing double digits and the fourth quarter is seasonally the strongest quarter of the year.\"",

Altman said that OpenAI is \"not the elected moral police of the world.\"Microsoft has for years been a major investor and cloud partner to OpenAI, and the two companies have used their respective strengths to build big AI businesses. But the relationship has shown signs of tension of late, with OpenAI partnering with Microsoft rivals like Google and Oracle, and Microsoft focusing more on its own AI services.Earlier on Thursday, Microsoft announced a series of new features for its Copilot AI chatbot, including an AI companion called Mico that can respond to users through a call feature and express itself by changing its color.Suleyman in August penned an essay titled \"We must build AI for people; not to be a person.\" He argued that tech companies should not build \"seemingly conscious\" services that can give humans the impression that they may be capable of suffering, and wrote that conscious AIs could create another \"axis of division\" for humanity.On Thursday, Suleyman said the creation of seemingly conscious AI is already happening, primarily with erotica-focused services. He referenced Altman's comments as well as Elon Musk's Grok, which in July launched its own companion features, including a female anime character.\"You can already see it with some of these avatars and people leaning into the kind of sexbot erotica direction,\" Suleyman said. \"This is very dangerous, and I think we should be making conscious decisions to avoid those kinds of things.\"OpenAI didn't immediately respond to requests for comment, while xAI responded saying, \"Legacy Media Lies.\"WATCH: Why it's time to take AI-human relationships seriouslywatch now",

    "body": "A Target logo is displayed outside one of their stores on August 2, 2025 in San Diego, California. Kevin Carter | Getty ImagesTarget said on Thursday it's cutting 1,800 corporate jobs as the retailer tries to get back to growth after four years of roughly stagnant sales.It marks the first major round of layoffs in a decade for the Minneapolis-based retailer. It announced the layoffs in a memo sent by Target's incoming CEO Michael Fiddelke to employees at its headquarters.The eliminated roles are a combination of about 1,000 employee layoffs and about 800 positions that will no longer be filled, a company spokesman said. Together, they represent an approximately 8% cut to Target's corporate workforce, according to the memo. Affected employees will be notified Tuesday.The retailer announced the cuts as it nears a leadership change.Target in August named Fiddelke, currently its chief operating officer and formerly chief financial officer, as the successor to longtime leader Brian Cornell. He takes the helm February 1.Fiddelke has also overseen the Enterprise Acceleration Office, an effort announced in May, which looked for ways to simplify company operations, use technology in new ways and speed up Target's growth. Target has been fighting a sales slump, as it tries to rebound from declining store traffic, inventory troubles and customer backlash. The company has said it expects annual sales to decline this year. Its shares have fallen by 65% since their all-time high in late 2021.Compared to retail competitors, Target draws less of its overall sales from groceries and other necessities, which can make its business more vulnerable to the ups and downs of the economy and consumer sentiment. About half of Target's sales come from discretionary items, compared to only 40% at Walmart, according to estimates from GlobalData Retail.As a result of that and other company-specific challenges, Target's sales trends and stock performance have diverged sharply from competitors. Shares of Walmart are up about 123% in the past five years, compared to Target's decline of 41% during the same time period.In a memo sent Thursday to employees at Target's headquarters, Fiddelke said the employee cuts will help Target make urgent changes.\"The truth is, the complexity we've created over time has been holding us back,\" he said in the memo. \"Too many layers and overlapping work have slowed decisions, making it harder to bring ideas to life.\"He said the cuts are difficult, but \"a necessary step in building the future of Target and enabling the progress and growth we all want to see.\"   Target employees affected by the layoffs will receive pay and benefits until January 3, in addition to severance packages, according to a company spokesman. No roles in stores or in Target's supply chain were impacted by the cuts, the company spokesman said.Read the full memo from Fiddelke:Team, This spring, we launched our enterprise acceleration efforts with a clear ambition: to move faster and simplify how we work to drive Target's next chapter of growth. The truth is, the complexity we've created over time has been holding us back. Too many layers and overlapping work have slowed decisions, making it harder to bring ideas to life. On Tuesday, we'll share changes to our headquarters structure as an important step in accelerating how we work. This includes eliminating about 1,800 non-field roles — about 8% of our global HQ team. As we make these changes, I'm asking all U.S. HQ team members to work from home next week. Target in India and our other global teams will follow their in-office routines. Decisions that affect our team are the most significant ones we make, and we never make them lightly. I know the real impact this has on our team, and it will be difficult. And, it's a necessary step in building the future of Target and enabling the progress and growth we all want to see.   Adjusting our structure is one part of the work ahead of us. It will also require new behaviors and sharper priorities that strengthen our retail leadership in style and design and enable faster execution so we can: Lead with merchandising authority; Elevate the guest experience with every interaction; and Accelerate technology to enable our team and delight our guests. Put together, these changes set the course for our company to be stronger, faster and better positioned to serve guests and communities for many years to come. Michael ",

Photos showed the building largely reduced to rubble.Trump said Wednesday that the 90,000 square foot ballroom will cost $300 million, higher than the original estimated price tag of $200 million.The White House has dismissed public anger over the demolition as \"manufactured outrage.\" The Treasury Department, which has a clear view of the demolition, banned its staff from sharing photos.Trump promised in July that the ballroom would not impact the East Wing.\"It'll be near it but not touching it, and pays total respect to the existing building, which I'm the biggest fan of,\" Trump said at the time.When asked about the demolition on Wednesday, Trump said the East Wing was \"very small\" and \"never thought of as being much.\"\"In order to do it properly we had to take down the existing structure,\" the president told reporters.Construction workers, bottom right, atop the U.S. Treasury, watch as work continues on a largely demolished part of the East Wing of the White House, Thursday, Oct. 23, 2025, in Washington, before construction of a new ballroom.

Gustavo Valiente | Europa Press | Getty Images  The U.S. is weighing curbs on software-related exports to China, in response to Beijing's sweeping rare-earth export controls, as both sides prepare for a critical round of negotiations.Answering a question from CNBC's Eamon Javers on whether Washington was considering limiting exports of products using American software to China, as reported by Reuters, U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent confirmed, saying that \"everything is on the table.\"\"If these export controls, whether it's software, engines or other things happen, it will likely be in coordination with our G-7 allies,\" Bessent added.President Donald Trump earlier this month said that the U.S. would impose export controls on \"any and all critical software\" to China beginning next month by barring global shipments of goods containing U.S. software to the country. Trump had also announced an extra 100% tariff on Chinese exports in retaliation to curbs Beijing announced on the exports of its rare earth minerals.Bessent's statement comes ahead of his highly anticipated talks with Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng in Malaysia later this week, which would set the stage for a potential meeting between Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping in South Korea at the month's end.A spokesperson for China's ministry of commerce said in a statement Thursday that a delegation led by He will hold trade talks with their U.S. counterparts in Malaysia from Friday to Monday. \"The two sides will discuss key issues in the bilateral relations, based on the important consensus reached during the phone calls between the two heads of state this year,\" the statement in Mandarin read, translated by CNBC.watch now\"How the meeting [between Bessent and He] goes will have a significant impact on the chance and vibe of Xi-Trump meeting later in Korea,\" said Neo Wang, China strategist at Evercore ISI. While the top leaders' meeting may not deliver a major deal, it will help keep the minister-level negotiations on track and ultimately help solve specific issues, Wang added.Trump said Wednesday that he has a \"long\" meeting scheduled with Xi during the upcoming trip to South Korea, where he expected to reach a deal with the Chinese leader over soybean purchases and limits on nuclear weapons.\"We can work out a lot of our questions and our doubts and our tremendous assets together. So we look forward to that. I think something will work out. We have a very good relationship, but that'll be a big one,\" the president told reporters at the White House.High-stakes meetingTensions between Washington and Beijing have intensified in recent weeks, as both sides have issued new threats ahead of negotiations.In September, the U.S. Commerce Department unveiled a dramatic expansion of its export controls as part of its efforts to block Beijing from accessing cutting-edge chips.China has hit back with sweeping new curbs on rare-earth exports, placed more U.S. companies on a blacklist and launched an antitrust investigation into tech major Qualcomm.watch nowBeijing has also started charging U.S.-linked ships with fees for docking at Chinese ports, matching the U.S. move to impose fees on Chinese vessels arriving at U.S. ports.The \"breakdown of trade truces\" has become the new norm, said Yue Su, principal economist at the Economist Intelligence Unit, stressing the continued tit-for-tats underscored by a \"deep and persistent mistrust\" between the two nations.Beijing's push for relaxed export controls, lower tariffs and investment opportunities in the U.S. will be \"hard asks\" for Washington, said Wendy Cutler, senior vice president at Asia Society Policy Institute, while naming critical minerals supplies, fentanyl curbs and soybean purchases among Trump's priorities.Both sides are working against the deadline of Nov. 10 when higher reciprocal tariffs are set to resume, if they fail to agree on another extension, though Trump has set Nov. 1 as the deadline for 100% additional tariffs announced earlier this month.\"A lot to be worked out in a short period of time,\" Cutler said, expecting both sides to extend the deadline for another 90 days, or longer, to keep talks going without implementing the threatened measures.",

    "body": "ESPN and YouTube TV.David Buono | Icon Sportswire | Jaque Silva | NurPhoto | Getty ImagesJust a month after reaching an agreement with NBCUniversal to avoid dropping its networks, YouTube TV has another potential blackout on its hands — this time with Disney.Disney said Thursday it would begin running public messages for YouTube TV subscribers to alert customers that the company's networks, including ABC and ESPN, will be dropped from the service if the two sides can't reach a new distribution agreement, which expires October 30 at 11:59 p.m. ET.\"This is the latest example of Google exploiting its position at the expense of their own customers,\" a Disney spokesperson said in a statement. \"If we don't reach a fair deal soon, YouTube TV customers will lose access to ESPN and ABC, and all our marquee programming — including the NFL, college football, NBA and NHL seasons — and so much more.\"Disney began running public announcements on YouTube TV at 5 p.m. ET.As with NBCUniversal, YouTube TV is asking for better rates for Disney's programming, according to people familiar with the discussions. YouTube TV has about 10 million subscribers and wants more favorable terms given their scale, the people said.\"We've been working in good faith to negotiate a deal with Disney that pays them fairly for their content on YouTube TV,\" a spokesperson for the service said in a statement. \"Unfortunately, Disney is proposing costly economic terms that would raise prices on YouTube TV customers and give our customers fewer choices, while benefiting Disney's own live TV products - like Hulu + Live TV and, soon, Fubo. Without an agreement, we'll have to remove Disney's content from YouTube TV and if it remains unavailable for an extended period of time, we will offer subscribers a $20 credit.\"Get the CNBC Sport newsletter directly to your inboxThe CNBC Sport newsletter with Alex Sherman brings you the biggest news and exclusive interviews from the worlds of sports business and media, delivered weekly to your inbox.Subscribe here to get access today.YouTube TV and NBCUniversal first reached a temporary extension to avoid a blackout before inking a finalized deal a few days later.Two years ago, Disney reached an unusual distribution agreement with Charter, the largest U.S. pay TV provider by subscribers, that gave certain Charter subscribers access to Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+ for no extra charge. Disney is willing to offer YouTube TV the same terms as that Charter agreement, two of the people said.YouTube TV is again asking to ingest Disney's streaming content, giving customers the ability to view programming on Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+ without leaving the YouTube platform, according to a person familiar with the negotiations. YouTube TV also asked for this in its negotiations with NBCUniversal and was rejected. Similarly, Disney has no plans to say yes to this request, according to people familiar with the company's thinking.The clash between Disney and YouTube has an added element of conflict. YouTube hired away former Disney distribution executive Justin Connolly earlier this year, prompting Disney to file a breach of contract lawsuit. Connolly has recused himself from these discussions, according to the people familiar with the process.Disclosure: Comcast is the parent company of NBCUniversal, which owns CNBC. Versant would become the new parent company of CNBC upon Comcast's planned spinoff of Versant.",

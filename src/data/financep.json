    "body": "Marvell Technology Group Ltd. headquarters in Santa Clara, California, on Sept. 6, 2024.David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesSemiconductor company Marvell on Tuesday announced that it will acquire Celestial AI for at least $3.25 billion in cash and stock.The purchase price could increase to $5.5 billion if Celestial hits revenue milestones, Marvell said. Marvell shares rose 13% in extended trading Tuesday as the company reported third-quarter earnings that beat expectations and said on the earnings call that it expected data center revenue to rise 25% next year. The deal is an aggressive move for Marvell to acquire complimentary technology to its semiconductor networking business. The addition of Celestial could enable Marvell to sell more chips and parts to companies that are currently committing to spend hundreds of billions of dollars on infrastructure for AI.  Marvell stock is down 18% so far in 2025 even as semiconductor rivals like Broadcom have seen big valuation increases driven by excitement around artificial intelligence.Celestial is a startup focused on developing optical interconnect hardware, which it calls a \"photonic fabric,\" to connect high-performance computers. Celestial was reportedly valued at $2.5 billion in March in a funding round, and Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan joined the startup's board in January. Optical connections are becoming increasingly important because the most advanced AI systems need those parts tie together dozens or hundreds of chips so they can work as one to train and run the biggest large-language models.Currently, many AI chip connections are done using copper wires, but newer systems are increasingly using optical connections because they can transfer more data faster and enable physically longer cables. Optical connections also cost more. \"This builds on our technology leadership, broadens our addressable market in scale-up connectivity, and accelerates our roadmap to deliver the industry's most complete connectivity platform for AI and cloud customers,\" Marvell CEO Matt Murphy said in a statement. Marvell said that the first application of Celestial technology would be to connect a system based on \"large XPUs,\" which are custom AI chips usually made by the companies investing billions in AI infrastructure. On Tuesday, the company said that it could even integrate Celestial's optical technology into custom chips, and based on customer traction, the startup's technology would soon be integrated into custom AI chips and related parts called switches.Amazon Web Services Vice President Dave Brown said in a statement that Marvell's acquisition of Celestial will \"help further accelerate optical scale-up innovation for next-generation AI deployments.\"The maximum payout for the deal will be triggered if Celestial can record $2 billion in cumulative revenue by the end of fiscal 2029. The deal is expected to close early next year. In its third-quarter earnings on Tuesday, Marvell earnings of 76 cents per share on $2.08 billion in sales, versus LSEG expectations of 73 cents on $2.07 billion in sales. Marvell said that it expects fourth-quarter revenue to be $2.2 billion, slightly higher than LSEG's forecast of $2.18 billion.

    "body": "The Sinclair Broadcast Group, Inc. headquarters are seen July 17, 2024 in Cockeysville, Maryland.Kevin Dietsch | Getty ImagesThe broadcast television industry knows it needs to consolidate. It's just struggling with how to do it.In August, Nexstar Media Group, the largest owner of broadcast stations in the U.S., announced a proposed $6.2 billion deal to buy Tegna — a combination that would bring together more than 260 stations across the U.S. Last week, Sinclair, the owner of 179 local TV affiliates, made a hostile offer to acquire its smaller peer E.W. Scripps after buying up nearly 10% of the company on the open market. Both potential deals remain in limbo, and executives are getting antsy.Companies like Sinclair and Nexstar run the affiliate stations of the major networks across the U.S. known for local news, sports and other broadcast content. They face the same headwinds as their cable and content studio counterparts — the shrinking number of pay-TV customers due to the rise of streaming and tech options. Broadcast station owners remain profitable, largely from the hefty fees they receive from pay-TV distributors. About 65 million U.S. households still subscribe to a bundle of linear TV networks. Anywhere from 33% to 50% of a broadcast station group's annual revenue stems from retransmission fees — payments made to a broadcaster for the inclusion of local TV affiliates in pay-TV bundles — with advertising making up most of the rest.Yet profitability is shrinking for these companies as the universe of traditional bundle subscribers gets smaller. The streaming strategy for local news and TV has yet to come together, and like other parts of the media, local newsrooms and their resources are dwindling. That's made station owners desperate to consolidate, just as the biggest media companies — including Paramount, Warner Bros. Discovery and Comcast's NBCUniversal — continue to plan their own potential mergers. The impetus for deals among station owners is to cut duplicate costs and add scale to their businesses, increasing negotiating power when it comes time for carriage renewals with the largest pay-TV providers such as Comcast, Charter, Google's YouTube TV and DirecTV.While some are facing regulatory headwinds, for Sinclair, it's family ownership dynamics coupled with cultural and governance issues that have complicated its latest efforts to buy scale. Family squabblesSinclair has been looking for an acquisition target for nearly a year. The company announced in August it was launching a strategic review with an eye toward merging its broadcast station business with a peer. By that point Sinclair and its advisors had already held discussions with potential merger partners, CNBC previously reported. One of those targets was Gray Media, according to people familiar with the matter, who spoke on the condition of anonymity about internal plans. But the conversations with Gray haven't advanced, the people said, as Gray is already awaiting government approval for a much smaller deal and isn't in a rush to explore another transaction.Sinclair then set its sights on Scripps, the owner of more than 60 stations and a variety of entertainment channels like Ion and Bounce. Deal discussions started in the last year, according to people familiar with the matter.Thomas Fuller | SOPA Images | Lightrocket | Getty ImagesInitial talks revolved around creating a company where both the Scripps family and the Smith family, which owns the majority of Sinclair's voting shares, would give up majority control of a combined company but remain involved, according to people familiar with the matter. Those early talks included developing an independent board that would be in charge of making pivotal business decisions, such as whether and when to preempt national programming. In September, Sinclair and Nexstar both preempted episodes of \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\" after the late night host made controversial comments following the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. Throughout the Scripps deal discussions, Sinclair proposed three different variations of a transaction, including different stipulations of who would remain as CEO and whether the deal would be structured as a merger or an acquisition, said the people familiar. The Scripps family ultimately balked, in part due to governance issues and cultural concerns, two of the people said. In particular, Sinclair's controlling family is known for its conservative politics. In 2018 Sinclair made all of its owned stations air so-called \"must-runs\" — commentary that sometimes echoed viewpoints of then-and-now-U.S. President Donald Trump. That same year, Sinclair's attempt to to acquire Tribune ultimately failed amid both Federal Communications Commission concerns and criticism by Democrats and public advocacy groups over whether the merger was in the public interest.\"I think there's a lot of complexity to any transaction, especially transactions that involve family-controlled public companies with highly levered balance sheets,\" Scripps Chief Financial Officer Jason Combs said during Wells Fargo's TMT Summit in November. \"I think they'd add some complexity around a variety of issues, whether it's economic splits, whether it is impacts to the capital structure and potential there, whether it's governance issues. There's a whole range of issues.\"When discussions went quiet in September, Sinclair began buying Scripps shares weekly until its stake amounted to roughly 8% and it had to go public, per the Securities and Exchange Commission. Currently, Sinclair has a 9.9% stake in Scripps. Sinclair publicly announced last month it would pursue a hostile transaction of Scripps. In the days following Sinclair's public proposal to acquire Scripps for $7 per share — or more than $580 million — Scripps adopted a shareholder rights' plan, commonly known as a \"poison pill,\" to give it more time to consider the offer. \"We believe the strategic and financial rationale of a potential Sinclair-Scripps combination is indisputable,\" Sinclair said in a statement last week. \"Given the family control of Scripps, the only effect of adopting a poison pill is to limit the liquidity opportunities for public shareholders of Scripps.\"A Scripps spokesperson on Wednesday said the company adopted the poison pill \"to ensure that all shareholders receive full value in connection with any proposal to acquire the company.\" The plan is intended to ward off \"coercive tactics\" and expires after a year, the spokesperson said. Insider trading concernsThere could be an additional layer of complication, too. After Sinclair's SEC filing that disclosed it had amassed a stake in Scripps, attorneys for Scripps sent a letter to Sinclair raising questions around the stock purchases, according to two of the people familiar with the matter. As part of early deal discussions, Sinclair and Scripps signed a nondisclosure agreement and Sinclair received nonpublic information, the letter noted, according to the people. When Sinclair stopped receiving nonpublic information remains unclear, as do specific details of the nondisclosure agreement. That leaves open for interpretation whether Sinclair's recent maneuver is a securities violation, according to attorney Jonathan Hochman, founding partner of Schindler Cohen & Hochman. \"Assuming Sinclair received confidential information from Scripps under an NDA, whether any of that information was material and not stale is interesting, because, if so, buying Scripps stock while in possession of that information sounds a lot like insider trading,\" said Hochman, who is not involved in the Sinclair-Scripps matter. Representatives for Sinclair and Scripps declined to comment. Government holdupBeyond complex deal structures and family ownership dynamics, the biggest hurdle for broadcast station mergers at large is U.S. law. The FCC currently prevents any one company from owning broadcast stations that reach more than 39% of the U.S. TV households. That threshold doesn't threaten a potential Sinclair-Scripps merger — which Sinclair has said would easily win regulatory approval — but it puts Nexstar's proposed acquisition of Tegna at risk. In order to go through, Nexstar's deal would require the lifting of the decades-old FCC rule, or at least significant waivers. \"We are focused on achieving deregulation, and we continue to advocate for the elimination of the antiquated constraints on local television ownership as the best solution to level the competitive playing field for all media,\" Nexstar CEO Perry Sook said in a November release when requesting approval for the Tegna deal. In addition to the 39% nationwide cap, broadcasters would also like to eliminate another law on the books that prevents one company from owning three or more ABC, CBS, Fox or NBC affiliates in a given media market. FCC Chairman Brendan Carr has been vocal about his support for reforming the laws. In one instance earlier this year, Carr reportedly called the ownership cap \"arcane, artificial limits,\" adding that such rules don't \"apply to Big Tech.\" In late September the FCC said it would review the ownership rules. But the changes have yet to take place, and the opposition's voice is getting louder. In addition, the Department of Justice has also been slow moving toward approving deals in the industry, creating a hurdle for deals of all sizes, one of the people said. Trump recently slammed the proposed consolidation of the industry in a Truth Social post. Meanwhile, Chris Ruddy, CEO of conservative cable TV channel Newsmax and a Trump supporter, is against FCC rules changes, arguing consolidation limits the number of potential voices and raises cable prices for Americans by giving more leverage to the affiliate groups. A representative for Carr didn't respond to requests for comment. U.S. President-elect Donald Trump speaks to Brendan Carr, his intended pick for Chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, as he attends a viewing of the launch of the sixth test flight of the SpaceX Starship rocket on November 19, 2024 in Brownsville, Texas. Brandon Bell | Getty ImagesThe argument against these mergers from the pay-TV distributors is that higher fees get passed down to consumers, which would likely amplify the hemorrhaging of traditional bundle customers. They also say it's unclear how consolidation of these companies would help the local news industry, as the station owners argue. \"Sinclair is brazenly seeking a mega-footprint nationwide and in local markets across the country, which will allow them to impose even more exorbitant retransmission consent fees. These higher prices will leave consumers with a painful choice—pay up or lose your programming,\" said Grant Spellmeyer,   president and CEO of America's Communications Association, an advocacy group for distributors, in a statement. Curtis LeGeyt, President and CEO of the National Association of Broadcasters, the industry's trade association, said in a statement to CNBC that local broadcasters are \"not asking for special treatment; we are asking for the ability to compete in today's media landscape.\" \"Lifting the arbitrary 39% limit, which applies only to broadcast stations, will allow station groups to invest in local journalism, sports rights and the technology that keeps communities informed during emergencies, especially in smaller markets,\" he said. \"The national cap was imposed during an era before broadband and streaming reshaped how Americans get their news, and the longer Washington delays addressing it, the harder it becomes for local stations to sustain the trusted local news and reporting that Americans rely on every day.\" Disclosure: Comcast is the parent company of NBCUniversal, which owns CNBC. Versant would become the new parent company of CNBC upon Comcast’s planned spinoff of Versant.",

    "body": "Nurphoto | Getty ImagesAnthropic, the AI startup behind the popular Claude chatbot, is in early talks to launch one of the largest initial public offerings as early as next year, the Financial Times reported Wednesday. For the potential IPO, Anthropic has engaged law firm Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati, which has previously worked on high-profile tech IPOs such as Google, LinkedIn and Lyft, the FT said, citing two sources familiar with the matter.The start-up, led by chief executive Dario Amodei, was also pursuing a private funding round that could value it above $300 billion, including a $15 billion combined commitment from Microsoft and Nvidia, per the report. It added that Anthropic has also discussed a potential IPO with major investment banks, but that sources characterized the discussions as preliminary and informal. If true, the news could position Anthropic in a race to market with rival ChatGPT-maker OpenAI, which is also reportedly laying the groundwork for a public offering. The potential listings would also test investors' appetite for loss-making AI startups amid growing fears of a so-called AI bubble. However, an Anthropic spokesperson told the FT: \"It's fairly standard practice for companies operating at our scale and revenue level to effectively operate as if they are publicly traded companies,\" adding that no decisions have been made on timing or whether to go public.CNBC was unable to reach Anthropic and Wilson Sonsini, which has advised Anthropic for a few years, for comment. According to one of the FT's sources, Anthropic has been working through internal preparations for a potential listing, though details were not provided. The FT report follows several notable changes at the company of late, including the hiring of former Airbnb executive Krishna Rao, who played a key role in the firm's 2020 IPO.CNBC also reported last month that Anthropic was recently valued to the range of $350 billion after receiving investments of up to $5 billion from Microsoft and $10 billion from Nvidia. In its race to overtake OpenAI in the AI space, the startup has also been expanding aggressively, recently announcing a $50 billion AI infrastructure build-out with data centers in Texas and New York, and tripling its international workforce.According to the FT report, investors in the company are enthusiastic about Anthropic's potential IPO, which could see it \"seize the initiative\" from OpenAI.While OpenAI has been rumoured to be considering an IPO, its chief financial officer recently said the company is not pursuing a near-term listing, even as it closed a $6.6 billion share sale at a $500 billion valuation in October.",

    "body": "Elon Musk, chief executive officer of Tesla Inc., during the US-Saudi Investment Forum at the Kennedy Center in Washington, DC, US, on Wednesday, Nov. 19, 2025.Bloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesElon Musk has again sounded the alarm on the dangers of AI and listed what he considers as the three most important ingredients to ensure a positive future with the technology. The billionaire CEO of Tesla, SpaceX, xAI, X and The Boring Company, appeared on a podcast with Indian billionaire Nikhil Kamath on Sunday.\"It's not that we're guaranteed to have a positive future with AI,\" Musk said on the podcast. \"There's some danger when you create a powerful technology, that a powerful technology can be potentially destructive.\" Musk was a co-founder of OpenAI alongside Sam Altman, but left its board in 2018 and publicly criticized the company for ditching its founding mission as a non-profit to develop AI safely after it launched ChatGPT in 2022. Musk's xAI developed its own chatbot, Grok, in 2023. Musk has previously warned that \"one of the biggest risks to the future of civilization is AI,\" and stressed that rapid advancements are leading AI to become a bigger risk to society than cars or planes or medicines.On the podcast, the tech billionaire emphasized the importance of ensuring AI technologies pursue truth instead of repeating inaccuracies. \"That can be very dangerous,\" Musk told Kamath, who is also the co-founder of retail stockbroker Zerodha.\"Truth and beauty and curiosity. I think those are the three most important things for AI,\" he said. He said that, without strictly adhering to truths, AI will learn information from online sources where it \"will absorb a lot of lies and then have trouble reasoning because these lies are incompatible with reality.\" He added: \"You can make an AI go insane if you force it to believe things that aren't true because it will lead to conclusions that are also bad.\"\"Hallucination\" — responses that are incorrect or misleading — is a major challenge facing AI. Earlier this year, an AI feature launched by Apple on its iPhones generated fake news alerts.These included a false summary from the BBC News app notifications on a story about the PDC World Darts Championship semi-final, where it wrongly claimed that the British darts player Luke Littler had won the championship. Littler did not win the tournament's final until the next day. Apple told the BBC at the time that it was working on an update to resolve the problem which clarifies when Apple Intelligence is responsible for the text shown in the notifications. Musk added that \"some appreciation of beauty is important\" and that \"you know it when you see it.\" Musk said AI should want to know more about the nature of reality because humanity is more interesting than machines.\"It's more interesting to see the continuation if not the prosperity of humanity than to exterminate humanity,\" he said. Geoffrey Hinton, a computer scientist and ex-vice president at Google known as a \"Godfather of AI,\" said earlier this year that there's a \"10% to 20% chance\" that AI will \"wipe us out,\" in an episode of the Diary of a CEO podcast. Some of the shorter term risks he cited included hallucinations and the automation of entry level jobs.\"The hope is that if enough smart people do enough research with enough resources, we'll figure out a way to build them so they'll never want to harm us,\" Hinton added.",

    "body": "watch nowCostco sued the Trump administration to get a full refund of new tariffs it paid so far this year, and to block those import duties from continuing to be collected from the retail warehouse club giant as a Supreme Court case plays out.In the suit filed Friday, Costco said that it risks losing the money it has already paid to satisfy the tariffs even if the Supreme Court eventually upholds earlier lower court rulings that found President Donald Trump did not have the legal power to impose those duties.The company noted a looming Dec. 15 deadline that could prevent the tariffs that it has already paid on an estimated basis from being refunded. Costco did not say how much money it believes should be refunded to the company.Costco's suit, filed in the U.S Court of International Trade, said that U.S. Customs and Border Protection denied the company's request to extend the Dec. 15 date of so-called liquidation, the final computation of tariffs assessed on imported items. While an importer has six months to file a protest contesting liquidation, \"not all liquidations are protestable,\" the suit said.A shopper exits a Costco store in Centerville, Ohio, US, on Tuesday, Oct. 21, 2025. Kyle Grillot | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesDozens of other companies have filed similar lawsuits to protect their right to potential refunds in case the Supreme Court rules against the so-called reciprocal tariffs that Trump imposed on imports from many U.S. trading partners and his so-called fentanyl tariffs on products from Canada, China, and Mexico.Trump invoked the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to impose those often high tariffs. In August, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, in a 7-4 ruling, upheld a prior decision by the Court of International Trade that found Trump did not have that power.\"The core Congressional power to impose taxes such as tariffs is vested  exclusively in the legislative branch by the Constitution,\" the Federal Circuit said in its ruling. \"Tariffs are a core Congressional power.\"During oral arguments on Nov. 5, a majority of the Supreme Court's nine justices appeared skeptical of arguments by a lawyer for the Trump administration that the president did have the power to impose the tariffs.The Supreme Court took the administration's appeal of the lower court rulings on an expedited basis, but it is not clear when or how the court will decide the dispute.Costco, in its lawsuit, said, \"This separate action is necessary, however, because even if the IEEPA duties and underlying executive orders are held unlawful by the Supreme Court, importers that have paid IEEPA duties, including Plaintiff, are not guaranteed a refund for those unlawfully collected tariffs in the absence of their own judgment and judicial relief.\"Read more CNBC politics coverageJudge dismisses James Comey and Letitia James cases over 'unlawful' prosecutor appointmentSen.

He posted a chart with subscribers that he said \"shows the kind of present value destruction that this level of dilution can impart.\"He said the vote to accept CEO Elon Musk's $1 trillion compensation plan means investors should expect to get diluted further — meaning that that these additional shares water down their ownership of the company. The package had 75% approval among voting shares, despite proxy advisors Glass Lewis and ISS coming out against it.\"With recent news of Elon Musk's $1 trillion dollar pay package, dilution is certain to continue,\" Burry wrote.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconTesla in 2025Tesla's market cap is currently $1.43 trillion. The electric vehicle maker's shares have added more than 6% so far in 2025, while the S&P 500 has surged more than 15% in the same period.Burry noted that moving past dilution \"is not easy\" for businesses. He also pointed to Palantir and Amazon as other well-known technology companies that dilute their shares through employee-based compensation, a practice that Burry said \"penalizes shareholders.\"The newsletter post goes into an in-depth explanation of how stock-based compensation is not accurately reflected under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) and how companies used \"adjusted\" earnings to present a bottom line that wrongly ignores the practice as a real expense.Burry quotes Warren Buffett's view of stock-based compensation being treated as something other than a tangible expense: \"What else could it be — a gift from shareholders?\" wrote Buffett in his Berkshire Hathaway 2018 annual letter.Burry launched his Substack called \"Cassandra Unchained\" late last month after deregistering hedge fund Scion Asset Management. The blog, which has a $379 annual subscription fee, has so far focused on why he believes artificial intelligence is a bubble.",

Michael Nagle | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesAmerican Eagle issued bullish holiday guidance and raised its full-year forecast on Tuesday after posting better-than-expected quarterly results. The apparel company is expecting fiscal fourth quarter comparable sales to grow between 8% and 9% – about four times better than the 2.1% analysts had anticipated, according to StreetAccount.American Eagle is now expecting its full year adjusted operating income to be between $303 million and $308 million – up from its previous range of $255 million to $265 million. American Eagle shares rose as much as 15% in extended trading.The company beat third-quarter expectations on the top and bottom lines. Here's how American Eagle did during the quarter compared with what Wall Street was anticipating, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:Earnings per share: 53 cents vs. 44 cents expectedRevenue: $1.36 billion vs. $1.32 billion expectedThe company's reported net income for the three-month period that ended Nov. 1 was $91.34 million, or 53 cents per share, compared with $80.02 million, or 41 cents per share, a year earlier.  Sales rose to $1.36 billion, up about 6% from $1.29 billion a year earlier.The results are the first time investors are seeing a full quarter of impact from American Eagle's splashy campaigns with Sydney Sweeney and Travis Kelce. Companywide, American Eagle saw comparable sales grow 4%, better than the 2.7% analysts had expected, according to StreetAccount. While the business's overall results topped expectations, they were primarily driven by Aerie, which saw comparable sales rise 11% and revenue jump about 13%. At American Eagle, where the campaigns were focused, comparable sales grew just 1%, worse than the 2.1% analysts had expected, according to StreetAccount. The company told CNBC the campaigns are \"attracting more customers\" and creating more attention around the brand, but the results show they have not yet been a major revenue driver.However, they're not having a major impact on profits, either. During the quarter, American Eagle's operating margin was 8.3%, better than the 7.5% analysts had expected, according to StreetAccount. Beyond its marketing campaigns, American Eagle told CNBC it saw record revenue in its third quarter and that \"strong momentum\" carried into the current quarter, where it saw a \"record breaking Thanksgiving weekend.\" The rosy holiday commentary comes after peers like Abercrombie & Fitch, Gap and Urban Outfitters posted better than feared results ahead of the crucial holiday shopping season. Investors have been watching discretionary retailers closely to look for slides in consumer demand because of tariffs, but many have proven resilient so far. They're showing that for now, higher prices aren't stopping consumers from shopping, as long as they feel like they're getting good value for their money. Industrywide holiday outlooks from outside consulting firms have been relatively murky, but the latest slate of earnings from discretionary retailers have been a positive omen for holiday sales. Plus, turnout during the so-called Turkey 5 shopping weekend, the five day stretch between Thanksgiving and Cyber Monday, was stronger than expected, according to the National Retail Federation. ",

    "body": "Sydney Opera House, designed by Danish architect Mr Jorn Oberg Utzon, at first light as the sun rises over Sydney harbor and city center skyscrapers.Ucg | Universal Images Group | Getty ImagesAustralia's third-quarter economic growth missed analysts' expectations, but clocked its fastest expansion in about two years, driven by strong investment and consumer demand. The country's GDP rose 2.1% year on year, marking its strongest expansion since the third quarter of 2023 when the economy grew at the same rate, data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics showed on Wednesday. Economists were expected GDP growth of 2.2%.  On a quarter-on-quarter basis, Australia's GDP grew 0.4% compared with 0.7% forecast in a Reuters poll. \"The miss isn't a sign of a materially weaker economy,\" said Harry Murphy Cruise, head of economic research and global trade at Oxford Economics, noting that excluding inventories and trade, the domestic economy surged 1.2% compared with the previous quarter — the fastest expansion in more than two years. Echoing that view, Sunny Nguyen, head of Australia economics at Moody's Analytics, attributed the softer-than-expected headline figure partly to businesses writing down inventories \"more aggressively than expected.\"\"But they say more about timing and accounting than underlying final demand,\" Nguyen added. Domestic final demand contributed 1.1 percentage points to growth. Private investment grew at the fastest pace since March 2021, driven by business investment in machinery, equipment and major data centers across New South Wales and Victoria.  Household consumption continued to expand, led by insurance, electricity, gas, rent, healthcare and food. Meanwhile, net trade was a major drag, denting the economy by 0.1 percentage point, as imports growth outpaced rise in exports in the three months through September. Before the GDP data was released, Reserve Bank of Australia Governor Michele Bullock cautioned that the economy had likely hit its potential growth limit at a time when inflation has been staying above the bank's target. The board will act on renewed price pressures, Bullock added.  The country's inflation accelerated in October, rising 3.8% year on year, marking its fastest pace in seven months, exceeding the RBA's targeted range of 2% and 3%. At the monetary policy meeting last month, the central bank kept its interest rate unchanged at 3.6%, saying it was cautious about easing further, given a strengthening economy, tight labor market and persistent inflationary pressure. Rate bets \"The Q3 data confirms that the economy is still too hot for the RBA's liking,\" said Cruise, adding that rate cuts were \"off the table for some time\" and a hike next week to nip inflation \"can't be ruled out.\"  Australian government 10-year bond yield rose 4 basis points to 4.650 after the release. It has gained 55 basis points since mid-October.   Bullock said last month that the current interest rate cutting cycle could be close to an end, with the central bank forecasting inflation to stay above its target range of 2% to 3% until the second half of next year. The RBA's board meets next week and is widely expected to leave interest rates at 3.6%.In the second quarter this year, Australia's economy expanded 1.8% year on year, compared with 1.3% in the prior quarter, underpinned by domestic spending including household and government consumption.

Eduardo Munoz Alvarez | Getty ImagesA desire for deep discounts inspired 202.9 million U.S. consumers to shop during the five-day stretch from Thanksgiving Day through Cyber Monday, according to a survey by the National Retail Federation and Prosper Insights & Analytics released on Tuesday.That estimated total surpassed the major trade group's forecast that 186.9 million people would shop during the five-day period. It also increased from last year's turnout of 197 million shoppers during the same period. The shopping turnout is the largest since NRF began tracking the five-day total in 2017, and topped the previous high of 200.4 million shoppers during the same days in 2023. The trade group does not estimate the total amount spent during the extended Thanksgiving weekend.On a call with reporters, NRF CEO Matt Shay described the shopping period as \"the psychological kickoff of the holidays.\" He said the number of shoppers represented \"a very, very solid beginning\" to the season.\"One of the key drivers here is that for many Americans and many families, holiday spending and holiday shopping is an essential part of the budget,\" he said. Even when consumers are pulling back and making trade-offs, they may still shop as December approaches. Shay said the holidays are \"very much an emotional purchase.\" Retailers and economists are closely watching spending during the peak shopping season while trying to make sense of conflicting indicators about the country and U.S. households' outlook. While consumer sentiment has tumbled and a growing number of major companies have laid off thousands of employees, retail sales data remains solid. Even during a time of year that typically brings higher store traffic, retailers have looked for ways to manage one of their top costs: labor. Holiday hiring by retailers is expected to total between 265,000 and 365,000 roles this year, the lowest number of seasonal workers in at least 15 years, according to the NRF.Despite that, the NRF anticipates U.S. consumers will still spend freely on gifts, decor and more. The trade group said in early November that it expects holiday spending to hit a record of between $1.1 trillion and $1.2 trillion from Nov. 1 through Dec. 31, the first time the total would top $1 trillion.That would represent a 3.7% to 4.2% increase from the year-ago holiday period. It would be a slight drop from last year's 4.3% holiday sales growth rate. NRF's forecast excludes auto dealers, gas stations and restaurants.Shay said the Thanksgiving weekend spending gives the industry group confidence it's on track to hit that projection. At the end of Cyber Monday, shoppers told NRF that they had about 53% of their holiday shopping remaining, which is similar to a year ago.

Michael Nagle | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesConsumers said in the survey that they were motivated to make purchases during the five days because of sales and promotions, such as free shipping and limited-time deals, said Phil Rist, executive vice president at Prosper Insights & Analytics, the research firm that conducts NRF's annual survey. The poll included nearly 3,100 adults and was conducted from Nov. 26 to Nov. 30.Mark Mathews, chief economist for the NRF, said \"there's a moat around this type of spending\" for families across income levels. He said financially stretched households typically cut back in other areas like recreation and travel as they prioritize spending on the holidays. He added that he expects shoppers to fill up bigger shopping baskets this season, including items that aren't for the holidays, because shoppers \"want to take advantage of these great deals that they're seeing.\"Top gifts bought during the five-day span were clothing and accessories, with 51% of consumers surveyed saying they purchased items in the category, followed by toys with 32%, books and other media with 28%. and gift cards with 26%.A total of 129.5 million consumers shopped in stores over the five days, a 3% year-over-year increase, the survey found, even as the more Americans have done more of their Black Friday shopping online in recent years. The online shopping turnout jumped even more — by 9% year over year  — as 134.9 million people shopped on retailers' websites and apps.Other research indicated a step-up in online spending, too. U.S. consumers spent a total of $14.25 billion online on Cyber Monday, a 7.1% year-over-year increase, according to Adobe Analytics. The company analyzes direct transactions online and covers over 1 trillion visits to U.S. retail sites, 100 million individual items and 18 product categories.  During the five-day stretch from Thanksgiving through Cyber Monday, Adobe said consumers spent $44.2 billion online overall — a 7.7% year-over-year jump. A significant chunk of that came from online spending on Black Friday, which totaled $11.8 billion and grew by 9.1% year over year as shoppers sought out early deals. ",

Tom Williams | Cq-roll Call, Inc. | Getty ImagesU.S. Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins on Tuesday threatened to cut off federal funding to Democratic-leaning states over what she alleged is their refusal to share SNAP program data with the Trump administration.The administration \"will begin to stop moving federal funds into those states\" starting next week \"until they comply,\" Rollins told President Donald Trump during a Cabinet meeting at the White House.New York Gov. Kathy Hochul, responding to Rollins in an X post, wrote, \"Genuine question: Why is the Trump Administration so hellbent on people going hungry?\"Rollins said her department needs the state-by-state data on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, known as food stamps, \"to root out this fraud and to protect the American taxpayer.\"The secretary said the U.S. Department of Agriculture in February had asked all 50 states \"for the first time to turn over their data to the federal government.\"She said 29 \"red states\" complied, but 21 \"blue states continue to say no.\"The noncompliant states include California, New York and Minnesota, Rollins said. The governors' offices for each of those three states did not immediately respond to CNBC's requests for comment.A USDA spokesperson later specified in a statement to CNBC, \"28 States and Guam joined us in this fight; but states like California, New York, and Minnesota, among 19 other blue States, keep fighting us.\"The department had \"established a SNAP integrity team\" to analyze state data and \"end indiscriminate welfare fraud,\" the spokesperson said.\"We have sent Democrat States yet another request for data, and if they fail to comply, they will be provided with formal warning that USDA will pull their administrative funds.\"Massachusetts has not yet received any notice from the Trump administration about withheld federal funds, Gov. Maura Healy's office told CNBC.But Healey nevertheless called Rollins' threat \"truly appalling and cruel.\"\"The Trump Administration is once again playing politics with the ability of working parents with children, seniors and people with disabilities to get food,\" the governor said in a statement. \"President Trump needs to order Secretary Rollins to release SNAP funding immediately and prevent more Americans from going hungry.\"Marissa Saldivar, a spokeswoman for California Gov. Gavin Newsom, told CNBC, \"We no longer take the Trump Administration's words at face value — we'll see what they actually do in reality.\"Saldivar added: \"Cutting programs that feed American children is morally repugnant.\"Critics have long accused the Trump administration of seeking to weaken food-stamp programs. The Republican-backed \"One Big Beautiful Bill Act,\" which Trump signed into law in July, includes cuts to SNAP. The administration later argued during the government shutdown that it could not pay full SNAP benefits in November because it lacked congressionally appropriated funding to do so. Multiple courts had rejected the administration's efforts to halt those payments.Nearly 42 million people benefited from SNAP each month in fiscal year 2024, most of whom are children, elderly or people with disabilities, according to USDA's official website.Rollins at the Cabinet meeting said SNAP suffers from \"rampant fraud.\" But a fact sheet from the USDA's Food and Nutrition Service, citing fiscal year 2023 data, says, \"The majority of SNAP benefits are used as intended.\" Out of nearly 262,000 authorized SNAP retailers, 1,980 were disqualified and 561 were fined in that time period, according to the fact sheet.— CNBC's Mary Catherine Wellons contributed to this report.",

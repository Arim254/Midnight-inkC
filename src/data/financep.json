    "body": "If you're someone who doesn't rush to file your taxes, you're not alone. Nearly 1 in 4 Americans say they wait until the last minute to file, according to a 2025 survey by IPX1031, a financial services firm.But there are practical reasons to consider filing early, starting Jan. 26, when the Internal Revenue Service opens the federal tax filing season.And this year, timing could matter more than usual, as IRS staffing cuts have added operational strain, according to the National Taxpayer Advocate Service, an independent watchdog within the IRS.Here are four reasons tax experts say filing well ahead of the April 15 deadline may be worth considering, plus one reason why you might want to wait. While these are general guidelines, you may want to consult a tax professional to determine what's right for you.1. You get your refund soonerOne of the most straightforward reasons to file early is speed. Most refunds for electronically filed returns are issued within about 21 days of acceptance if you choose direct deposit, the fastest method for receiving funds. If you file a paper return or receive your refund by mail, expect it to take at least six to eight weeks, per the IRS.That matters, considering the average federal tax refund runs into the thousands, with IRS filing-season data showing the average refund for the 2024 tax year was just over $3,000.\"Even with IRS staffing issues, early filers are typically first in the queue once processing begins,\" Joon Um, an IRS enrolled agent and certified financial planner in Los Angeles, tells CNBC Make It.2. Extra time to pay taxes you oweFiling early doesn't mean you have to pay your tax bill early. Even if you submit your return in January or February, taxes aren't due until the filing deadline in April.That buffer can be especially helpful if your return shows a balance due. Preparing early gives you time to plan how you'll cover the bill rather than scrambling at the last minute. This can matter even more for freelancers, gig workers or anyone whose tax withholding didn't fully cover the amount of taxes they will owe, says Randy Bruns, a certified financial planner in Illinois. 3. Advantages when applying for financial aid, loans or housingA completed tax return is often required to move forward with major financial steps, including qualifying for a mortgage, applying for income-restricted housing lotteries or verifying eligibility for health insurance subsidies.In those situations, a filed return can serve as income verification because it reflects what you actually earned over the year, rather than an estimate. That can be especially helpful for people with variable income, including self-employed workers or freelancers, says Bruns. In some cases, a year-over-year drop in earnings can make you eligible for certain income-based programs, including health insurance subsidies and some housing programs. Having a recently filed return can help document that lower income when proof is required and allow eligibility to be reviewed sooner, Bruns says.For Affordable Care Act coverage, eligibility is based on projected income, but a recently filed return can still help support a claimed income drop if an application is flagged for verification. \"It doesn't override projections, but it can support them and speed up resolution when questions arise,\" says Bruns.4. Head off scammersFiling early can reduce the risk of tax-related identity theft, which often happens at the start of the filing season, according to Turbo Tax.Criminals can use stolen Social Security numbers to submit fraudulent returns and claim refunds before the legitimate taxpayers file. When that happens, the real return can be delayed or flagged while the IRS sorts out the discrepancy.To reduce the chance of getting scammed, the IRS offers an optional identity protection PIN, which blocks anyone from filing a tax return using your Social Security number unless they have the correct six-digit code.In some cases, you may want to wait before filingFiling early can make sense for many taxpayers, but it isn't the right move for everyone.Early filing tends to work best for people with relatively simple, salary-based income and complete paperwork. Taxpayers with investment income, side gigs or pass-through business income may benefit from waiting, because key tax forms can arrive late or be revised, says Um.Those taxpayers may want to delay filing until they receive all expected Form W-2s, Form 1099s or Schedule K-1s, since filing before all documents arrive can increase the risk of errors and amended returns, Um says. \"Filing too early and then amending later usually creates more problems than it solves,\" he adds.Want to get ahead at work with AI?

    "body": "From rising education costs to the price of essentials and extracurriculars, raising kids can be expensive — especially if they want to be an elite athlete one day.Arthur Liu, father of Olympian and 2025 world champion figure skater Alysa Liu, estimates he's spent a total of $500,000 to $1 million on her training alone, he told CBS' \"60 Minutes\" earlier this month. \"I spared no money, no time,\" on the now 20-year-old skater's training, Arthur Liu said.Certainly not everyone is going to spend as much as Liu did — the average U.S. family spent $1,016 on their child's primary sport in 2024, according to a report by The Aspen Institute — but paying for your child's extracurriculars adds up, says Joe Piszczor, a certified financial planner and founder of Washington Family Wealth in Washington, Pennsylvania. Given the cost of international travel, coaching, equipment and entry fees at an elite level, six to seven figures not a wildly outrageous amount to spend on a child's activities, and footing that bill is OK, Piszczor says, as long as you are aware of your goals and financial situation first.\"I just stress that if they want to do it correctly, let's make sure our house is in order first and we know what our actual discretionary budget is,\" Piszczor says. \"Just know your limits.\"Paying for an extracurricular can produce positive outcomesIt's not wrong to spend money on your child's activities, says Tom Balcom, a CFP and founder of 1650 Wealth Management in Lighthouse Point, Florida. In fact, \"for those who spend money on dance, sports, band — they will say that every penny is worth it because of what their child learns along the way,\" Balcom says.Because Balcom is paying for lessons, practice and tournaments, he says his daughter — a high school sophomore who aspires to play Division I golf one day — is not only improving as a golfer, but learning about the importance of teamwork, discipline and time management.Plus, the benefits will spill over into her future, even if she chooses not to play golf at the collegiate level, Balcom says. Dedication to an activity can be a positive differentiator in the college application process itself, especially in a competitive environment where many students have good grades and test scores, he says.There's no guarantee you'll make your money backHowever, if you're investing thousands of dollars in your child's extracurricular activities, make sure you're not banking on any monetary returns, such as an athletic scholarship in college or your child becoming a professional, says Piszczor. According to the NCAA, the primary governing body for college sports in the U.S., just under 7% of students who participate in high school athletics will compete in an NCAA sport in college, and only about 2% of high school athletes are awarded athletics scholarships.Furthermore, career-ending injuries can happen, or your child can decide to quit or focus on a different passion, Balcom says. Alysa Liu, for example, retired from figure skating at age 16 due to burnout, before ultimately returning to the sport competitively in 2024, he says.\"For families hoping elite extracurriculars lead to college money, the odds are long,\" Piszczor says. \"The most reliable return on investment for college funding is academics and overall financial preparedness, not assuming a passion will pay for itself.\"Protect your financial futureWhen spending money on your child's activities, stick to discretionary money you can afford to lose, both Piszczor and Balcom say. Keep enough money to cover essential monthly expenditures like food and housing, as well as a cash reserve worth three to six months of expenses to cover emergencies, Piszczor says. While tradeoffs can be made, like eating out less or skipping a yearly vacation to cut back on expenses, never tap into your own retirement savings or go into debt to finance your child's dreams, Balcom says.\"People want to see their kids happy, and there's nothing wrong with that,\" Piszczor says. \"Just having that balance is important.\"Want to get ahead at work with AI?

    "body": "Traders work at the post where GameStop is traded on the floor at the New York Stock Exchange on June 12, 2024.Brendan McDermid | ReutersMichael Burry, the investor made famous by his bet against the U.S. housing market ahead of the financial crisis, disclosed that he has been buying shares of one-time meme darling GameStop.\"I own GME. I have been buying recently. I expect I am buying at what may soon be 1x tangible book value / 1x net asset value,\" Burry said in a Substack post published Monday. \"And getting a young [GameStop CEO] Ryan Cohen investing and deploying the company's capital and cash flows. Perhaps for the next 50 years.\"Shares of GameStop surged more than 6% on Monday following the news.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconGameStop shares in the past dayBurry, who recently closed his hedge fund Scion Asset Management, said his investment is a long-term value play rather than a wager on renewed meme stock speculation. GameStop was at the center of a meme stock frenzy that erupted roughly five years ago, when retail traders coordinating on online forums drove the shares to extraordinary heights and forced massive short-covering by hedge funds.\"I am not counting on a short squeeze to realize long-term value,\" he wrote. \"I believe in Ryan, I like the setup, the governance, the strategy as I see it. I am willing to hold long-term, and I am excited to see where this goes. I am fifteen years his senior, but not too old to be patient.\"The stock has since given back most of those gains as trading activity normalized and speculative interest waned. It last traded around $25 apiece.Still, GameStop has taken advantage of periods of elevated investor interest to raise billions of dollars through equity offerings, leaving it with a substantial cash pile.  \"Ryan is making lemonade out of lemons,\" Burry wrote. \"He has a crappy business, and he is milking it best he can while taking advantage of the meme stock phenomenon to raise cash and wait for an opportunity to make a big buy of a real growing cash cow business.\"The video game retailer began buying bitcoin last year in a similar move made famous by MicroStrategy, now known as Strategy. Cohen said at the time that the decision to buy bitcoin is driven by macro concerns as the digital coin, with its fixed supply and decentralized nature, could serve as protection against certain risks.\"I do not know about this Bitcoin thing, but I cannot argue with what has been done so far,\" Burry said.Burry isn't the only notable investor betting on the company as of late. Just last week, Cohen snapped up 1 million shares of GameStop, according to disclosures filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. In a Jan. 21 SEC filing, he noted that it's \"essential\" for the CEO of a public company to buy shares with his or her own personal funds \"in order to further strengthen alignment with stockholders.\"",

    "body": "Chinese officials are reviewing Meta's $2 billion acquisition of AI startup Manus for possible technology control violations, FT reported on Tuesday.Sopa Images | Lightrocket | Getty ImagesMeta Platforms is set to test new subscription models across its apps, including Instagram, Facebook and WhatsApp in the coming months, according to a report from TechCrunch on Tuesday. The report, confirmed by a Meta spokesperson, said the subscriptions are expected to \"unlock more productivity and creativity\" by giving paid users access to more features and expanded AI capabilities. Meta's recently acquired suite of general AI agents under Manus will also be scaled as part of the subscription plans. Meta Platforms bought Manus — a Singapore-based developer of AI agents founded in China — in December for a reported $2 billion.With its new subscription plans, Meta could be seeking a return on investment from its massive spending on AI talent and acquisitions last year, even before the Manus purchase. While Meta has been developing large language models under the Llama umbrella, those have been open-sourced. That means general access to Llama has remained free, unlike with paid plans from AI leaders like OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic.Other features offered as part of Meta's paid plans could include full access to its AI-powered short-form video experience Vibes, which allows users to create and remix AI-generated videos. While Vibes has been free since its launch in 2025, the new subscription model would grant free access to its basic version, with the option to pay for additional features. The subscriptions will be separate from Meta Verified, a paid product rolled out by the company in 2023 that gave content creators and businesses a verified badge, 24/7 direct support, protection against impersonation, search optimization, and more.Meta told TechCrunch that it plans to listen to its user community and gather feedback as it rolls out subscriptions in the coming months.",

    "body": "Cheng Xin | Getty ImagesTikTok users have been deleting the app at a higher rate since the company announced that its U.S. operations would be housed in a new joint venture.The daily average of U.S. users deleting the TikTok app has increased nearly 150% over the past five days compared with the previous three months, market intelligence firm Sensor Tower told CNBC.Last Thursday, TikTok said it had formed a joint venture to keep the video-sharing app operating in the U.S. under new American leadership. The company named Adam Presser, formerly TikTok's head of operations, as CEO of the joint venture. Some users took to social media to voice their skepticism about the new joint venture after being prompted to agree to an updated privacy policy on Thursday.Several social media posts pointed to language in the new policy that describes the types of data TikTok may collect, including sensitive information such as \"your racial or ethnic origin\" as well as \"sexual life or sexual orientation, status as transgender or nonbinary, citizenship or immigration status, or financial information.\"Despite the social media uproar, that language does not appear to be new. An archived version of the policy from August 2024 includes the same provisions.Those concerns appear to have weighed on sentiment around the app after the announcement of the joint venture, contributing to a spike in uninstalls over the past several days.watch now\"If I can delete my biggest platform because their terms of agreement and censorship have gotten out of control, so can you!\" creator Dre Ronayne posted on Threads, the micro-blogging service owned by Meta. Ronayne said she had nearly 400,000 followers on TikTok before deleting her account on Sunday.Other creators have also reported problems posting to the app, with users complaining about outages and video uploads failing to go through.The social media company hasn't communicated to its creators what the joint venture means for them, Nadya Okamoto, a TikTok creator with over 4 million followers, told CNBC. \"That's why there is so much paranoia, because we're all kind of looking at this platform and we just don't know what's happening,\" she said. Okamoto told CNBC she has experienced issues with the app over the past several days and has been unable to upload videos for roughly 24 hours. During the uncertainty, she is continuing to post her content on Instagram and Google's YouTube.\"Online there's a lot of conversation about — is this all coincidence or censorship, and what does this look like?\" Okamoto said. \"For everything to be happening at once, it is very scary.\"An X account associated with the TikTok joint venture said on Monday that the services issue was caused by a power outage at a U.S. data center.\"We're working with our data center partner to stabilize our service. We're sorry for this disruption and hope to resolve it soon,\" the account wrote.However, the increase in uninstalls has not translated into a meaningful drop in U.S. usage. TikTok's active user levels in the U.S. have remained relatively flat compared with the previous week, according to Sensor Tower.Competing apps, however, have seen a bump in interest. Sensor Tower data shows U.S. downloads for UpScrolled increased more than tenfold compared with the prior week, while Skylight Social rose 919% and Chinese-owned Rednote climbed 53% week over week.TikTok did not respond to request for comment.",

    "body": "A shopper carries a Nike bag in the Union Square neighborhood of San Francisco, Jan. 21, 2026.David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesNike is cutting 775 employees as the company looks to boost its bottom line and accelerate its use of \"automation,\" CNBC has learned. The layoffs, which are in addition to the 1,000 corporate job cuts the company announced last summer, primarily impact distribution center roles in Tennessee and Mississippi, where the sneaker giant operates large warehouses, people familiar with the matter said. In a statement to CNBC, Nike said the layoffs primarily affect its U.S. distribution operations and are designed to \"reduce complexity, improve flexibility, and build a more responsive, resilient, responsible, and efficient operation.\"\"We're taking steps to strengthen and streamline our operations so we can move faster, operate with greater discipline, and better serve athletes and consumers,\" Nike said in the statement. \"We are sharpening our supply chain footprint, accelerating the use of advanced technology and automation, and investing in the skills our teams need for the future.\" It is unclear how many total U.S. distribution jobs Nike has. The company added the cuts are part of Nike's goal to get back to \"long-term, profitable growth\" and improve margins.As the use of AI and automation sweeps across corporate America, distribution center jobs are expected to take a hit. Last year, UPS announced plans to cut 48,000 roles — in part because of more automation at its facilities. It's unclear how exactly Nike plans to expand automation at its distribution centers and how much of a role that's playing in its 775 job cuts.The layoffs come as CEO Elliott Hill works to turn around Nike following years of slowing sales and shrinking margins. The struggles came after former top executive John Donahoe pursued a direct selling strategy that prioritized the retailer's stores and websites over wholesale partners. watch nowAs part of that strategy, Nike's distribution centers — and staff within those facilities — ballooned, but they don't have the volume to support those staffing levels, the people familiar with the matter said. Under Hill, Nike has been working to woo back wholesale partners, clean out stale inventory and reignite innovation. When reporting earnings for the fiscal second quarter in December, Nike said its net income had fallen 32% as it contended with tariffs, costs associated with its turnaround and a slowdown in its key China market. ",

    "body": "Sign at the entrance to a Target store in Venice, Florida. Erik Mcgregor | Lightrocket | Getty ImagesTarget's incoming CEO, Michael Fiddelke, told employees Monday that the \"violence and loss of life in our community is incredibly painful,\" following the second fatal shooting by federal agents in the company's hometown of Minneapolis in recent weeks.\"I know it's weighing heavily on many of you across the country, as it is with me,\" he said in a video message sent to the big-box retailer's workforce. \"What's happening affects us not just as a company, but as people, as neighbors, friends and family members within Target.\"In the video, Fiddelke did not name the two U.S. citizens killed in the shootings, Renee Good or Alex Pretti, describe the actions of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents during the enforcement surge in Minneapolis or call for any specific policy changes. He also did not mention President Donald Trump or his administration.Corporations and CEOs largely stayed silent throughout the deployment of thousands of federal agents in Minneapolis and the killing of Good by an ICE agent earlier this month. Yet even before Saturday's deadly shooting, public opinion polls reflected concerns about the Trump administration's tactics, with 61% of respondents to a New York Times/Siena poll taken after Good's death saying ICE's tactics had gone too far.Thousands of people have marched in the streets of Minneapolis in subzero winter temperatures to protest ICE actions. And on Friday, many local businesses shuttered for an event called \"Day of Truth and Freedom,\" which was organized and backed by local faith leaders.More than 60 Minnesota business leaders, including Fiddelke, signed a letter Sunday calling for an \"immediate deescalation of tensions\" after Pretti's killing. That message also did not specifically mention the shootings or Trump.Target's Chief Operating Officer Michael Fiddelke will take over as CEO from Brian Cornell.Courtesy of TargetFiddelke, Target's chief operating officer, will step into the CEO role on Feb. 1. In the video message to employees, he said he's looking forward to starting the job in a week and \"this isn't the first message I imagined I'd send.\"He said he's \"been meeting with a range of leaders and this weekend added my signature to a statement using our collective voice to call for calm, constructive dialogue and deescalation to reduce tension and keep people safe as that work continues.\"Read the full transcript of Fiddelke's video here:Hi team. In one week I will officially start as CEO. We're about to step into a new chapter for Target, and I've been looking forward to starting this work with you for some time, but this isn't the first message I imagined I'd send. We'll have time to talk very soon about our plans to move Target forward, but right now, as someone who is raising a family here in the Twin Cities and as a leader of this hometown company, I want to acknowledge where we are. The violence and loss of life in our community is incredibly painful. I know it's weighing heavily on many of you across the country, as it is with me. What's happening affects us not just as a company, but as people, as neighbors, friends and family members within Target. We are doing everything we can to manage what's in our control, always keeping the safety of our team and guests our top priority. During my more than 20 years at Target, one of the things I've loved is how we are part of the communities where we operate. Since the beginning, we've given 5% of our profits and millions of volunteer hours to make them strong and vibrant places to live and work. In line with that, I've been meeting with a range of leaders and this weekend added my signature to a statement using our collective voice to call for calm, constructive dialogue and deescalation to reduce tension and keep people safe.As that work continues, looking ahead to next week, I'll spend my first days in the field listening and learning alongside our teams, and then we'll come together for an all-team huddle to talk about how we're moving our business forward. Our leadership team is activated, HR is equipped, and our resources remain ready to give you the care and support you need. Thank you for everything you do for each other, our guests, and our communities.",

    "body": "The White House on Monday appeared to soften its rhetoric surrounding the recent killing of ICU nurse Alex Pretti by federal agents in Minneapolis, after its initial response spurred widespread calls to de-escalate ongoing federal deportation efforts in Minnesota.\"Nobody in the White House, including President [Donald] Trump, wants to see people getting hurt or killed in America's streets,\" press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters during a briefing.That includes Pretti and Renee Nicole Good — another U.S. citizen who was fatally shot by federal agents in Minneapolis — \"and the brave men and women of federal law enforcement and the many Americans who have been victimized at the hands of illegal alien criminals,\" Leavitt said.Trump \"does not want any Americans to lose their lives in the streets of America,\" Leavitt later added.The statement from the White House, which signaled sympathy for the two people killed during chaotic altercations with immigration officers, contrasted sharply with how some administration officials first reacted to the shootings.Stephen Miller, Trump's homeland security adviser, had called Pretti a \"domestic terrorist\" and accused him of being an \"assassin.\"Greg Bovino, Border Patrol commander at large, claimed Pretti may have been intending to \"massacre law enforcement.\"Multiple media outlets, including the Associated Press, reported Monday citing sources that Border Patrol commander Bovino and some agents are expected to leave Minneapolis by Tuesday.Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, shortly after Pretti's killing, claimed he had been \"brandishing\" a weapon and that he had reacted \"violently\" to officers' attempts to disarm him. Later analyses from multiple news outlets found many of those claims were contradicted by the available video evidence.Leavitt, asked Monday about Miller's comments, said, \"I have not heard the president characterize Mr. Pretti in that way.\"Leavitt's comments came one day after Trump, in an interview with The Wall Street Journal, would not  directly say if he believed shooting Pretti was the right thing to do.\"We're looking, we're reviewing everything and will come out with a determination,\" Trump told the newspaper.Earlier Monday, Trump announced on Truth Social that border czar Tom Homan will head to Minnesota on Monday night to manage U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement's on-the-ground operations there.\"Tom is tough but fair, and will report directly to me,\" Trump wrote.Leavitt said in a separate social media post that Homan will coordinate with officials leading ongoing investigations into fraud schemes in Minnesota.Trump's post said Homan has not previously been involved in Minnesota, where thousands of federal agents have been deployed in recent weeks to carry out the Trump administration's aggressive deportation agenda.The Good and Pretti killings have stoked massive protests, heated denunciations of ICE from Democrats and pleas for de-escalation from business leaders.As Homan takes the reins in Minnesota, Noem and other administration officials face mounting criticism, including from gun rights groups and some conservatives, over their leadership and rhetoric in Minneapolis.Fox News reported Sunday that some senior officials involved in immigration enforcement have \"grown increasingly uneasy & frustrated [with] some of the claims & narratives DHS pushed\" following the latest shooting.Axios reported last month that Noem and Homan have a tense and acrimonious working relationship. Trump has praised both officials.Noem, in a statement on X, said Trump's decision to tap Homan for Minnesota is \"good news for peace, safety, and accountability in Minneapolis.\" \"I have worked closely with Tom over the last year and he has been a major asset to our team— his experience and insight will help us in our wide-scale fraud investigations, which have robbed Americans, and will help us to remove even more public safety threats and violent criminal illegal aliens off the of streets of Minneapolis,\" Noem said.\"We continue to call on the leadership in Minnesota to allow for state and local partnership in our public safety mission,\" she said.The president's switch-up also comes as his polling numbers on immigration, and his overall approval rating, have declined, according to recent surveys from The New York Times and Siena University and others.A Reuters/Ipsos poll published Monday afternoon found just 39% of Americans approve of Trump's immigration efforts, marking his lowest reading in the survey since returning to the White House.In another Truth Social post later Monday morning, Trump said Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz called him and asked to work together in the state.\"It was a very good call, and we, actually, seemed to be on a similar wavelength,\" Trump wrote. \"I told Governor Walz that I would have Tom Homan call him, and that what we are looking for are any and all Criminals that they have in their possession.\"\"The Governor, very respectfully, understood that, and I will be speaking to him in the near future. He was happy that Tom Homan was going to Minnesota, and so am I!\" Trump added.The positive words for Walz telegraphed the shift in tone that the White House would later employ from the briefing room lectern. Previously, Trump administration officials have regularly castigated the Democratic governor, and even accused him of helping stoke the social strife in Minneapolis that led to the shootings.To be sure, Leavitt in Monday's briefing still laid blame for the unrest in Minnesota at Walz's feet.\"This tragedy occurred as a result of a deliberate and hostile resistance by Democrat leaders in Minnesota,\" she said. \"For weeks, Governor Walz and [Minneapolis Mayor Jacob] Frey and other elected Democrats were spreading lies about federal law enforcement officers who are risking their lives daily to remove the worst criminal illegal aliens from our streets.\"The government has reportedly subpoenaed Walz and other Minnesota Democrats as part of an investigation into possible obstruction of federal law enforcement operations in the state.Walz's office called the conversation with Trump \"productive,\" saying in a statement that the governor \"made the case that we need impartial investigations of the Minneapolis shootings involving federal agents.\"DHS, rather than the FBI, will conduct the investigation into the shooting of Pretti by the department's own officials, MS NOW reported Sunday, citing officials.Trump agreed to talk to DHS about \"ensuring the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension is able to conduct an independent investigation, as would ordinarily be the case,\" according to Walz's office.\"The President also agreed to look into reducing the number of federal agents in Minnesota and working with the state in a more coordinated fashion on immigration enforcement regarding violent criminals,\" the statement said.Tensions in Minnesota have boiled over after the two killings by federal agents in Minneapolis.Good, a 37-year-old mother of three, was fatally shot by ICE agent Jonathan Ross on Jan. 7 as she began to drive her SUV after another agent ordered her out of the car.On Saturday, Pretti, a 37-year-old intensive care unit nurse in Minneapolis, was shot and killed by federal officers.Both killings occurred in daylight in front of witnesses and were caught on video from multiple angles, massively ratcheting up the already-intense scrutiny over immigration agents' tactics and training.In both cases, numerous Trump administration officials rushed to defend the agents' actions as justified, while making claims about the incidents that later analyses found were contradicted by the evidence.On the same day that Pretti was killed, DHS claimed that he approached U.S. Border Patrol officers with a handgun and, after they attempted to disarm him, \"violently resisted.\"But videos show Pretti holding up a phone as the confrontation begins. And the clips also appear to show one officer removing a weapon from Pretti's person prior to any shots being fired.Pretti was believed to be a lawful gun owner with a permit to carry his weapon, Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O'Hara said at a news conference.",

The Build conference, marking its second consecutive year in Seattle, is expected to put emphasis on the company's cloud technologies and the artificial intelligence features within those services.Grant Hindsley | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesMicrosoft announced the next generation of its artificial intelligence chip, a potential alternative to leading processors from Nvidia and to offerings from cloud rivals Amazon and Google.The Maia 200 comes two years after Microsoft said it had developed its first AI chip, the Maia 100, which was never made available for cloud clients to rent. Scott Guthrie, Microsoft's executive vice president for cloud and AI, said in a blog post Monday that, for the new chip, there will be \"wider customer availability in the future.\" Guthrie called the Maia 200 \"the most efficient inference system Microsoft has ever deployed.\" Developers, academics, AI labs and people contributing to open-source AI models can apply for a preview of a software development kit.Microsoft said its superintelligence team, led by Mustafa Suleyman, will use the new chip. The Microsoft 365 Copilot add-on for commercial productivity software bundles and the Microsoft Foundry service, for building on top of AI models, will use it as well.Cloud providers face surging demand from generative AI model developers such as Anthropic and OpenAI and from companies building AI agents and other products on top of the popular models. Data center operators and infrastructure providers are trying to increase their computing prowess while keeping power consumption in check. Microsoft is outfitting its U.S. Central region of data centers with Maia 200 chips, and they'll arrive at the U.S. West 3 region after that, with additional locations to follow. The chips use Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.'s 3 nanometer process. Four are connected together inside each server. They rely on Ethernet cables, rather than the InfiniBand standard. Nvidia sells InfiniBand switches following its 2020 Mellanox acquisition.The chip offers 30% higher performance than alternatives for the same price, Guthrie wrote. Microsoft said each Maia 200 packs more high-bandwidth memory than a third-generation Trainium AI chip from Amazon Web Services or from Google's seventh-generation tensor processing unit.Microsoft can achieve high performance by wiring up to 6,144 of the Maia 200 chips together, reducing energy usage and total cost of ownership, Guthrie wrote.In 2023, Microsoft demonstrated that its GitHub Copilot coding assistant could run on Maia 100 processors.WATCH: Chinese AI models adapt without Nvidiawatch now",

    "body": "The Microsoft data center campus, currently under construction, is reflected in Mount Pleasant, Wisconsin, September 18, 2025.Audrey Richardson | ReutersLocal officials have signed off on Microsoft's plans to build 15 more data centers in Mount Pleasant, Wisconsin, near an existing site that the technology company is expanding. Additional data center capacity will allow Microsoft to recognize revenue that it has booked from OpenAI and other clients. Amazon, Google and Oracle are racing Microsoft to build data centers filled with Nvidia chips that can train and run generative artificial intelligence models. Finding sites for these facilities can be challenging because utilities don't always have the necessary energy available. And increasingly, people who live near prospective data center sites are mounting opposition campaigns.Mount Pleasant homeowners and officials have generally welcomed Microsoft's expansion in the village.In 2017, device manufacturer Foxconn announced plans to build a $10 billion plant that would create 13,000 jobs in an initiative trumpeted by President Donald Trump. The village made room, buying up land. State tax dollars went toward infrastructure improvements. But Foxconn didn't exactly follow through. By 2023, the company employed 1,000 people across the state, and the village owed over $250 million.In the adjacent village of Caledonia, many residents spoke out against Microsoft's request to rezone land for a data center, and in September the company decided to stop pursuing that location.The new work in Mount Pleasant is divided into two lots just northwest of Microsoft's current site. For the larger of the two lots, Microsoft bought the land from the village and from private owners in 2023 and 2024. The two sets of plans call for almost 9 million square feet of building area, with three proposed substations, according to documents on file with the village.Together, the taxable value of the proposed developments exceeds $13 billion, according to the paperwork.Mount Pleasant's village board on Monday unanimously approved the two sets of plans. During a public comment period, six people expressed support for Microsoft's plans, and three people raised concerns. One of the opponents said jobs working on the data centers won't be permanent. David DeGroot, Mount Pleasant's village board president, objected to that characterization.\"I'm addressing this to all of the union folks that are here,\" DeGroot said. \"When I heard that these jobs are temporary from somebody, if I was you, I would take umbrage to that, because it's my understanding that you are going to be out there on those sites for the next 10 years, doing your jobs, plying your trade, and I don't see anything temporary in 10 years.\"On Wednesday, the village planning commission approved site plans that factor in changes staff members had proposed. The 15 new data centers would not require more water than the 8.4 million gallons it's expected to receive annually from the nearby city of Racine, Samuel Schultz, Mount Pleasant's community development director, told the planning commission.Microsoft can now submit final civil engineering plans and file building permits.

    "body": "watch nowThere's a new Chinese model gaining buzz among developers: Zhipu AI's GLM 4.7. That in itself is not new, but what did catch our attention was where it's becoming popular: the U.S., our own turf.I first spotted Zhipu's post on WeChat, announcing that the new coding tool was seeing so much demand, it would start limiting access. A year after DeepSeek's R1 model shook the artificial intelligence landscape in the U.S., AI experts are saying that they're seeing Chinese AI models spreading around the world. I wanted to see if that was also true for Zhipu.I reached out to the company, with no expectations of hearing back, just as DeepSeek has never responded to our requests. But Zhipu recently went public in Hong Kong, and its investor relations team is on top of the ball. They replied almost immediately, telling me that \"the user base of Zhipu GLM Coding Plan is primarily concentrated in the United States and China.\"American developers have always told us of the bias against using Chinese models — so for Zhipu to be gaining traction here suggested a real DeepSeek-like breakout moment.Just last week, we were floored by the apps that Replit and Claude Code were able to produce in minutes. They felt like the frontier of AI, an example of how American innovation is leading the way. It's also creating a tangible shift, leading to a 60% surge in new app releases. But if a model out of China is just as powerful and easy to use, are they really six months behind like Google DeepMind's Demis Hassabis says? And if they're cheaper and open source, what real moats do the American AI coding agents have? CNBC's Deirdre Bosa and I jumped on the chance to experiment with Zhipu, to see if the hype would match our successes with Replit and Claude. I've always found Chinese stock exchanges difficult to navigate and get data from, so we asked it to build a tracker for the biggest public companies in China. Zhipu whipped up an app more quickly than its American counterparts could, but its results were less polished.We're naturally skeptical of claims from companies that tout usage without publishing metrics, so we checked in with some sources — people building in AI that would come across Zhipu if it really was making inroads here. It was quickly clear that Zhipu's GLM 4.7 is indeed a model gaining recognition in the U.S., though reviews are mixed.One of the builders testing it is Tuhin Srivastava of Baseten, a platform that sits underneath AI applications and sees real-world model usage across enterprises. That matters even more now that Baseten just raised a new round with Nvidia participating, a signal that it's plugged into real, large-scale AI workloads. A conversation with Srivastava and Bosa was livestreamed here at 2:30 p.m. ET on Monday.

    "body": "Meta's 5-gigawatt \"Hyperion\" data center under construction in Richland Parish, Louisiana, on January 9, 2026.MetaThe popular narrative that artificial intelligence is the engine keeping the U.S. economy alive appears to be overstated, according to recent analyses. The AI boom has reshaped market valuations, driven large investments and record bond issuance to finance data centers, and heavily influenced gross domestic product, or GDP, especially in early 2025. This led many economists and market participants to suggest AI investment was the savior of an otherwise-stagnant domestic economy. However, a January report from MRB Partners U.S. economic strategist Prajakta Bhide reveals that consumption was the most crucial driver of U.S. GDP growth last year, which is usually the case in periods of economic expansion. AI-related capital expenditures were the second-biggest driver, she said. \"AI is an important part of the growth story, but it's not the only part of the growth story. That's a narrative that's out there, that if we didn't have the AI capex, GDP would have slumped last year. And that's simply not true,\" Bhide said in an interview with CNBC. \"Still, it's the U.S. consumer that continues to drive the expansion.\" Given that a lot of high-tech equipment is imported, AI's GDP value is smaller than one might suspect, Bhide said. GDP is comprised of four components: consumption, investment, government spending and net exports. Imports don't count given that GDP measures domestic production.Bhide found that without making any adjustment for imports, AI-related components seem to have added around 90 basis points, or 0.9%, to real GDP growth on average between the first quarter to the third quarter of 2025, or a little under 40% of average real GDP growth over the period. When adjusted for the real imports of computers, peripherals and parts, semiconductors and related devices, and telecom equipment — considered AI-related equipment — then the net average contribution of AI-related investments is smaller, between 40 and 50 basis points, or about 20%-25% of real GDP growth between the first and third quarters, her research shows.Also, even though data centers get a lot of headline attention, Bhide said that it was investments in software and computers that were AI's most important contributions to GDP growth in 2025.\"Although a negative shock to the optimism around A.I. implies a risk to GDP growth, the more realistic (and smaller) estimate of A.I.'s growth impact after adjusting for imports dispels the popular notion that the U.S. economy would falter without it,\" Bhide wrote in the Jan. 8 report. \"Without an A.I. boom, there would have certainly been less GDP growth last year, but there would also be fewer imports, so that overall real growth would still have been decent, above 1.5%, due to solid personal consumption.\" Bespoke Investment Group in December similarly dispelled notions of AI contributions to GDP in a post on X, publishing a chart titled: \"A unique Q1 created vastly over-stated 'AI share of Economy' perceptions.\" The firm found that in the second and third quarters of 2025, categories linked to artificial intelligence spending accounted for just 15% of quarterly GDP growth, with their share of overall GDP coming out less than 5% overall.There is not yet an official final number for 2025 U.S. GDP growth given that annual revisions come out later, and the quarterly results show a mixed picture in a year dominated by strong AI investment, consumer demand and headwinds such as volatile U.S. tariff policies. Real GDP increased at a much higher-than-expected annual rate of 4.3% in the third quarter of 2025. GDP rose at a 3.3% annualized pace in the second quarter, also stronger than estimated. Meanwhile, first-quarter GDP shrank at a 0.3% annualized pace, marking the first negative quarterly growth since the start of 2022.Support for a resilient economy aheadBhide's research underscores the importance of consumer spending as a major leg of economic expansion. Looking ahead, she expects resilient consumption to continue in 2026 despite slower income growth and rising wealth concentration among top U.S. earners. \"You do have the support coming from the fiscal side, and that gives you a little bit of an offset for the aggregate income growth being not as maybe as strong as last year. ... The U.S. consumer's still, in our view, in good shape,\" Bhide told CNBC. \"The argument that only the rich are driving consumption and that somehow makes consumption vulnerable ... we don't find a lot of evidence for that. I don't think the hollowing out of consumption is that much of a cyclical risk,\" she added.Bhide expects economic growth this year also will be supported by further AI investments, Federal Reserve rate cuts and a stabilization in the U.S. unemployment rate that has been aided by a collapse in immigration. She remains watchful of quarterly productivity statistics and the pace of job creation. ",

    "body": "watch nowUSA Rare Earth shares rallied Monday after the critical minerals startup announced that the Department of Commerce will take an equity stake. Commerce has issued a letter of intent that would provide USA Rare Earth with a $1.3 billion loan and $277 million in federal funding. USA Rare Earth will issue Commerce 16.1 million shares of common stock and 17.6 million in warrants. The U.S. government will have an 8% to 16% stake in the company depending on whether the warrants are exercised, according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. USA Rare Earth will also raise $1.5 billion from private investors. The proposed deal with Commerce is subject to the finalization of certain conditions.CEO Barbara Humpton said the deal with the U.S. government will turn USA Rare Earth into an industry leader. Its stock soared 29% at its high Monday before closing with a gain of about 8% at $26.72 per share.\"This is a watershed moment in our work to secure and grow a resilient and independent rare earth value chain based in this country,\" Humpton told analysts on a call Monday. \"We have long said that meeting the urgent call to reassure the rare earth and critical minerals industry will require a multiplayer solution, and this establishes our company as one of the leaders,\" she said. USA Rare Earth is the latest in a series of mining companies that the Trump administration has taken equity stakes in as it builds a Western rare earth and critical minerals supply chain to reduce dependence on China. Rare earths are a subset of critical minerals that are crucial inputs in strategic industries like defense, robotics, electric vehicles and semiconductor manufacturing.Magnet plant and mineThe capital infusion from the Trump administration will help USA Rare Earth advance its plan to build a magnet manufacturing plant in Stillwater, Oklahoma, and a mine at a rare earth deposit in Sierra Blanca, Texas, called Round Top. Commerce will disburse the funding from 2026 through 2028 based on milestones as USA Rare Earth implements its business plan, Chief Financial Officer Rob Steele told analysts on the call.USA Rare Earth is on track to commission its magnet manufacturing plant in the first quarter of 2026, Steele said. It aims to start commercial mining operations at Round Top in late 2028, he said. The company needs about about $4.1 billion to execute its plan, Steele said. It will have about $3.5 billion between its current cash and the government financing as well as private funding announced Monday, he said. This leaves $600 million in additional capital that USA Rare Earth needs to raise. \"We believe we can raise the remaining capital from attractive sources, and you should assume that's equity capital but that can come from strategic investments as well as institutional investors,\" Steele said. Funding conditions But USA Rare Earth has to satisfy several conditions before the agreement with Commerce is finalized. This includes raising at least $500 million from sources other than the federal government, which it will satisfy with the private funding announced Monday. It also has to secure two memorandums of understanding with semiconductor end or midstream users, obtain feedstock supply agreements through 2027, and define a power plan for its magnet facility among other conditions, according to its SEC filing. The planned investment in USA Rare Earth comes after the Defense Department struck a landmark deal last summer with rare earth miner MP Materials that included an equity stake, price floor and offtake agreement. The Trump administration also took stakes in Lithium Americas and Trilogy Metals last year.The agreement with USA Rare Earth does not include price floors or offtake agreements. The U.S. has been dependent on rare earth imports from China, which dominates the global supply chain. Beijing tried to cut off rare earth exports last year during trade disputes with the Trump administration.\"USA Rare Earth's heavy critical minerals project is essential to restoring U.S. critical mineral independence,\" Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said in a statement. \"This investment ensures our supply chains are resilient and no longer reliant on foreign nations.\"",

    "body": "Lujiazui Business Districk in Pudong, Shanghai, China.Liqun Liu | Construction Photography | Hulton Archive | Getty ImagesAsian equity markets are attracting global investors, with a surge in initial public offerings, rising cross-border flows, and accelerating deal activity underscoring the region's growing importance in global capital markets, according to senior executives at JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs.\"It's unbelievable what activity we're seeing [in Asia],\" Sjoerd Leenart, JPMorgan's Asia Pacific CEO, said on CNBC's \"Access Middle East\" Monday, adding that a significant share of IPO volumes last year came from the region. IPO proceeds in Asia Pacific also more than doubled last year, according to EY data, with seven out of the top 10 global deals happening in the region.\"We see this [activity] in the M&A markets … but also in the equity markets, and it's actually quite widespread,\" Leenart said.The strong inflows at the start of the year follow a robust 2025, when several Asian equity benchmarks outperformed the U.S.The MSCI AC Asia Pacific index, which tracks over 1,000 large- and mid-cap stocks across 13 regional markets, has hit multiple records this year, having gained more than 25% in 2025. Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 and South Korea's Kospi have also hit all-time highs in recent days. According to data from Goldman Sachs, foreign inflows into South Korean markets have been healthy, with Korea-focused mutual funds seeing about $1.3 billion in net inflows this year as of mid-January.Similarly, daily turnover across China's Shanghai, Shenzhen and Beijing stock exchanges hit record this month, prompting regulators to tighten margin financing rules.watch nowIn 2025, Asia-Pacific was the largest region by IPO proceeds, according to a recent study by EY. The region saw a 106% surge in proceeds compared with 2024, with India remaining the world's top active listing destination by deal count.\"China, Hong Kong have been a big part of that. And it's fantastic to see the market confidence coming back,\" said Leenart.\"That positive trend from 2025 I think, is likely to set through in 2026,\" Leenart added. \"The Chinese are doing everything to continue to stimulate the economy, and that's what people are betting on.\"The renewed interest in Asia comes as investors reassess how businesses and markets are functioning amid persistent geopolitical uncertainty. Kevin Sneader, Goldman Sachs' APAC ex-Japan president, told CNBC that markets have become more adept at operating through volatility rather than waiting for it to pass.\"China, India, Japan, Korea. Very much on the attention of international investors,\" he said.\"It is true to say there's a lot of renewed interest in Asia and renewed interest in China. Part of that has come from resilience and indeed, the impressive way in which technology has been developing in this part of the world,\" Sneader said, highlighting South Korean markets and its semiconductor companies as a key beneficiary.Technology firms Samsung Electronics and SK Hynix together account for over 30% of the entire Kospi index, data from Yuanta Securities showed. SK Hynix soared 274% in 2025, and has advanced 20% so far this year, as per LSEG data. Samsung Electronics skyrocketed 125% last year and has gone on to advance 30% year to date.Goldman Sachs expects Chinese equities to rise about 20% this year. It has also lifted its 12-month target for Taiwan's TAIEX to 34,600 from 32,400, implying 8% upside citing stronger-than-expected earnings growth as AI demand boosts the outlook and investment plans of the TSMC — the world's largest chipmaker.Goldman said rising capital spending at TSMC and sustained tightness in advanced chips are lifting profit forecasts across Taiwan's broader semiconductor and hardware supply chain.Late Monday,  President Donald Trump said that he was increasing tariffs on imported autos, pharma, and lumber from South Korea from 15% to 25% because of a delay in that country's legislature approving a trade deal with the United States reached last summer.While some auto stocks fell, South Korea's Kospi was trading 0.6%.\"Tariffs are a part of life. I think business leaders are learning to live with them and understand that,\" Sneader said a day earlier. \"In that context, what really matters is how their businesses perform, and for investors, how you factor that into your decision making.\"— CNBC's Emily Tan contributed to this story.",

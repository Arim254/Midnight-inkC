    "body": "Kevin Warsh, former governor of the US Federal Reserve, speaks with CNBC on July 17, 2025.CNBCPresident Donald Trump said Friday that Kevin Warsh has moved to the top of his list as the next Federal Reserve chair, though others remain in contention, according to the Wall Street Journal.Previously considered on Trump's short list but not the favorite, Warsh, a former Fed governor himself, apparently ingratiated himself further following an interview Wednesday with the president.\"Yes, I think he is,\" Trump told the paper when asked if Warsh was at the top, according to an account posted Friday afternoon.Referring to National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett, whom prediction markets previously had projected as the favorite, Trump said, \"I think you have Kevin and Kevin. They're both — I think the two Kevins are great.\"\"I think there are a couple of other people that are great,\" the president added.Hassett emerged as the lead candidate following a Bloomberg News report. Publicly, he has been demure when asked about the prospect of taking the job, saying only he would serve if asked. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), said Thursday on CNBC that she worried Trump would appoint a \"sock puppet\" as Fed chair to do his bidding.In addition to putting heavier weight on Warsh getting the job, Trump repeated an assertion he has made in the past that the Fed chair ought to consult the president about interest rate decisions.\"Typically, that's not done anymore. It used to be done routinely. It should be done,\" he said. \"I'm a smart voice and should be listened to.\"Trump has been at odds with the current chair, Jerome Powell, almost from the moment he nominated him for the position in 2017. Often resorting to name-calling and personal insults, Trump has badgered the Fed to lower interest rates, dissatisfied even with the current pace of cuts that has seen the central bank lop off three-quarters of a percentage point from its key rate since September. The Fed most recently cut Wednesday, taking the benchmark federal funds rate down to a range of 3.5%-3.75%, which Trump thinks should be even lower.Trump noted that Warsh largely agrees with his stance on monetary policy.\"He thinks you have to lower interest rates,\" Trump said. \"And so does everybody else that I've talked to.\"Prediction markets moved following the Journal report. Previously giving Hassett about a 71% chance of the nomination, that slipped to 62%, with Warsh at 36%, according to Kalshi.Trump did leave enough space to change his mind, noting that he has several good candidates in front of him.\"I think I have somebody that I like the best,\" he said. \"I like all of them, but I want to be careful because I was given a bad recommendation\" when he named Powell to the spot.Over the year, Trump repeatedly has blamed former Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin for recommending Powell. Current Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has led the current search. Trump has made no secret that he'd prefer Bessent to take on the role, but the Treasury chief has said repeatedly he is not interested.Other candidates considered included current Governors Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman along with Rick Rieder, who runs the fixed income operation at money management giant BlackRock. They were the last of a group of 11 candidates considered for the post.Powell's term expires in May, having been reappointed to the position by former President Joe Biden.Asked at his Wednesday news conference about his legacy, Powell said, \"I really want to turn this job over to whoever replaces me ... with the economy in really good shape. That's what I want to do.\"",

    "body": "Broadcom CEO Hock Tan.Lucas Jackson | ReutersBroadcom's quarterly results and guidance sailed past Wall Street estimates. It didn't matter. The chipmaker's shares plummeted 11% on Friday, their worst day since January, as investors ran for the exits on the artificial intelligence trade. Oracle dropped 4.5% a day after plunging 10% following its earnings report. Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices, the two leading makers of graphics processing units for AI workloads, slid about 3% and 5%, respectively. AI has been the driver for the stock market and the broader economy this year, so any negative sentiment has potentially far-reaching consequences. The Nasdaq on Friday fell about 1.69%, and the S&P 500 declined by 1%. The companies getting hit the hardest are the ones most closely tied to AI infrastructure, which has been booming as hyperscalers build out their data centers to try and meet what they describe as insatiable demand for compute-intensive AI services. Broadcom makes custom chips for many of the the largest tech companies, and saw its market cap about double each of the past two years before rallying again in 2025.\"This stock is up 75-80% year to date. You're seeing a little bit of a pullback,\" Vijay Rakesh, an analyst at Mizuho, told CNBC's \"Squawk on the Street\" on Friday. \"We would be buyers on this pullback.\"Mizuho raised its price target on the stock to $450 from $435. It closed on Friday just below $360. \"This is still where the growth is,\" Rakesh said. \"They are still the big supplier to Google on their entire hardware stack, to Meta, to Anthropic and even OpenAI coming down the road.\" Broadcom reported revenue growth of 28% during the quarter, largely due to a 74% increase in AI chip sales, to a total of $18.02 billion, topping the $17.49 billion average analyst estimate, according to LSEG. Adjusted earnings per share of $1.95 adjusted topped the $1.86 average estimate.watch nowCEO Hock Tan said Broadcom expects AI chip sales this quarter to double from a year earlier to $8.2 billion, both from custom AI chips as well as semiconductors for AI networking.One concern among investors is that margins are coming down, at least in the short term, due to higher up-front costs. CFO Kirsten Spears said on the earnings call that \"gross margins will be lower\" for some of Broadcom's AI chip systems because the company will have to buy more parts to produce the server racks. Broadcom also said it had a $73 billion backlog of AI orders over the next 18 months. Part of that is from $21 billion of orders from Anthropic, which the company revealed as a key customer on Thursday.While OpenAI has been a highly touted customer following a multibillion-dollar agreement announced in October, Tan doused some hope for the deal, telling investors late Thursday that, \"We do not expect much in '26.\" Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon said in a note on Friday that \"AI angst\" was driving Broadcom's shares lower.\"Frankly we aren't sure what else one could desire as the company's AI story continues to not only overdeliver but is doing it at an accelerating rate,\" Rasgon, who recommends buying the stock and raised his price target, wrote in the note. Oracle has been facing more extreme skepticism. The stock is now down more than 40% from its record reached in September. The company beat on earnings but missed on revenue in its report on Wednesday, and investors were disappointed they didn't get more detail on how Oracle will finance its massive buildout that so far has required mounds of debt. CoreWeave, which is investing in data centers to offer cloud-based AI services, sank 10% on Friday and has lost more than half its value since peaking in June.

    "description": "After 41 draws without a winner, the Powerball lottery jackpot has climbed to $1 billion — the seventh largest in the lottery's history.Even if you do",
    "body": "After 41 draws without a winner, the Powerball lottery jackpot has climbed to $1 billion — the seventh largest in the lottery's history.Even if you don't match all six numbers, smaller prizes of $1 million and $50,000 are still in play.If you somehow beat the odds and win a large cash prize, what happens next can be just as important as the win itself. That's because decisions you make in the first few days can leave you vulnerable to losing or mismanaging the prize.Here are five common mistakes experts say to avoid, starting the moment the ticket is in your hands.1. Handing an unsigned ticket to the store clerkUntil a lottery ticket is signed, \"the person who physically holds a winning ticket\" can claim the prize, according to the South Carolina Education Lottery, one of the state lotteries that administers Powerball.Participating state lotteries generally direct players to use validation tools — self-check terminals, mobile app scanners or official lottery websites — rather than relying on store staff. That guidance exists in part because store clerks have been caught stealing winning tickets.To prevent fraud, you'll want to sign the ticket in ink right away, state lotteries advise. It also can't hurt to have a photocopy or photo of the signed ticket, since it can help if your ticket is lost or misplaced, according to the South Carolina Education Lottery.2. Not keeping the ticket in a safe placeYou signed the ticket, but where do you put it? Because a winning ticket functions much like cash, you don't want to keep it in your pocket, wallet or lying on a desk in your home, says George Gagliardi, a certified financial planner in Lexington, Massachusetts.\"Holding the winning ticket before claiming it is akin to walking around town with $100 million in your wallet,\" he says.The official ticket needs a secure location. A common recommendation is to lock it in a bank safe deposit box or a personal fireproof safe or lockbox as soon as possible.3. Telling everyone about winningAnnouncing a big lottery win can invite financial requests, scams and unwanted attention, says Gagliardi. It's often safer to keep the news within a very small circle of trusted family members.Some state lotteries require winners to go public when they claim the prize, which is why it can help to consult a financial advisor, a lawyer and an accountant before coming forward, State Farm advises.They can walk you through payout options and, in some states, help set up a trust that allows you to claim the prize anonymously.4. Rushing to claim your prizeWinners are often given between 90 days and a year to claim a prize, depending on the state.Rushing to claim it can prevent you from building the advisory team you'll need to manage immense wealth. Without a lawyer, accountant and financial advisor experienced in large windfalls, you risk making costly decisions about taxes, investments and spending, State Farm reports.5. Deciding on the payout too quicklyPowerball winners must choose between two payout options: a 30-year annuity worth the full listed jackpot amount or a lump-sum cash payout that is roughly half the advertised prize. For a $1 billion jackpot, the annuity would pay about $33.3 million per year, according to USAMega.com.Each option comes with tradeoffs. The annuity provides guaranteed installments with a larger total payout over time, while the cash option gives you immediate access to a sizable sum that can be invested right away. Your age, estate planning needs and comfort with investment risk can all shape which payout structure makes the most sense. Consult a trusted financial professional who can help you make decisions based on your individual financial situation.It can also help to slow down before making a choice, since \"you will be in an emotional state for a while, and one wants to make decisions logically, not emotionally,\" says John Loyd, a certified financial planner in Texas.Want to give your kids the ultimate advantage?

    "body": "watch nowStock Chart IconStock chart iconTilray Brands, 1-dayPresident Donald Trump is expected to issue an executive order as soon as Monday that would allow for reclassification of marijuana, a person familiar with the matter told CNBC. The person asked not to be named because they are not authorized to speak about the White House's plans.Such a move would allow cannabis companies to fall under different tax regulations and encourage investment.Cannabis stocks took a leg up in Friday's midday trading following CNBC's report.The Washington Post first reported Thursday that Trump was expected to use an executive order to instruct federal agencies to reclassify marijuana as a less-regulated Schedule III drug from a Schedule I. Axios reported that the potential reclassification of marijuana — out of a group that includes heroin and into a lower tier of less dangerous drugs, such as steroids and Tylenol with codeine — would take place early next year.Trump floated a change in marijuana's classification in August.\"Trump rescheduling marijuana was not an if, in our assessment, but a when,\" Ed Groshans of Compass Point, a middle-market investment bank, wrote to clients in a Friday note.More optimismGroshans said the reported change would be \"positive\" for the cannabis industry, allowing banks to serve the sector.He said he expects that if Trump orders cannabis to be rescheduled, the Drug Enforcement Administration would finalize a proposed rule for the reclassification by the summer.Bill Kirk, senior research analyst at Roth, said he's also monitoring whether the Supreme Court decides next week to hear a case on state regulations and federal prohibition of cannabis. A positive ruling for the industry in that case could speed up regulatory timelines.The industry sees the latest moves as a sign of progress to normalize pot under national law.\"I'm a lot more optimistic than I ever have been,\" Tilray CEO Irwin Simon told CNBC. Shawn Hauser, partner at cannabis-focused law firm Vicente LLP, said a reclassification would mark only a \"partial victory,\" as the sector will need to continue fighting for legalization. However, she said the momentum can press Congress to create a regulatory framework that offers broader changes around safety, access and criminal justice reform than what a rescheduling provides.\"This [is] the beginning of a new era of public health policy,\" Hauser said. \"If implemented, it dismantles nearly a century of outdated drug policies that fly in the face of science and medicine.\"Pot stocks have struggled since a brief mania around public growers and dispensaries in the years before Covid, even as cannabis has received broader acceptance and some states have eased their classifications.Tilray shares were recently trading at a little more than $10 after peaking at more than $2,140, adjusted for splits, in September 2018.

    "body": "Billionaire philanthropist MacKenzie Scott has unveiled the final tally for her 2025 charitable donations, which totaled $7.17 billion in gifts to roughly 225 organizations, she wrote in a blog post published on Tuesday.\"This dollar total will likely be reported in the news, but any dollar amount is a vanishingly tiny fraction of the personal expressions of care being shared into communities this year,\" Scott wrote.Scott's 2025 giving brings her total donation amount since 2019 to $26.3 billion, based on her past public announcements of her charitable giving. This year's donations went to a wide range of nonprofits including several historically Black colleges and universities, and organizations focused on issues including poverty, social injustice and climate change.Scott's updated philanthropic tally puts her behind only fellow billionaires Warren Buffett and Bill Gates in terms of lifetime giving, according to Forbes. Forbes still estimates a $29.9 billion net worth for Scott, who became one of the world's wealthiest women following her 2019 divorce from Amazon founder Jeff Bezos.DON'T MISS: The ultimate guide to teaching your kids about moneyFollowing her divorce, Scott signed The Giving Pledge, committing to giving away the bulk of her wealth in her lifetime. She tasked a team of advisors with helping her step up her philanthropic giving by identifying \"organizations with strong leadership teams and results\" across a wide range of areas of societal need, she wrote in a 2020 blog post.Specifically, she wanted to pay \"special attention to those operating in communities facing high projected food insecurity, high measures of racial inequity, high local poverty rates and low access to philanthropic capital,\" she wrote.In her Tuesday essay, Scott wrote about putting her giving into perspective, citing data from Giving USA, which reported in June that Americans donated more than $590 billion in charitable giving in 2024. Much of the country's philanthropy — whether monetary or otherwise — happens on a relatively small scale, Scott wrote.\"Over 70% of Americans reported giving both labor and money to people they know, and half reported doing the same for strangers,\" wrote Scott, adding: \"It's easy to focus on the methods of civic participation that make news, and hard to imagine the importance of the things we do each day with our own minds and hearts.\"Scott mentioned multiple examples of generosity she received before she became wealthy, helping inspire her more recent philanthropy. She wrote about a \"local dentist who offered me free dental work when he saw me securing a broken tooth with denture glue in college,\" and her college roommate at Princeton University \"who found me crying, and acted on her urge to loan me a thousand dollars to keep me from having to drop out in my sophomore year.\"That roommate, Jeannie Ringo Tarkenton, went on to found Funding U, a student lender that offers loans to low-income students without requiring a co-signer, Scott noted.Scott highlighted those examples while encouraging civic participation in myriad forms, from financial gifts to random acts of kindness: \"Respect, understanding, insight, empathy, forgiveness, inspiration – all of these are meaningful contributions to others.\"Scott's blog post did not break down how or why she chose any of the hundreds of organizations she supported in 2025. A long-standing aspect of her giving does stand out in contrast to many other billionaire philanthropists: Her donations typically come without any strings, meaning organizations are free to use the money however they see fit.Her goal has been to \"de-emphasize privileged voices\" like her own, \"and cede focus to others,\" she wrote in a 2021 blog post.\"People struggling against inequities deserve center stage in stories about change they are creating,\" Scott wrote in that post. \"This is equally — perhaps especially — true when their work is funded by wealth.\"Want to give your kids the ultimate advantage?

    "body": "Photo released from the Jeffrey Epstein files shows Donald Trump with multiple women. Redactions were done by the Democrats on the House Oversight Committee. Date and context is unclear.Source: Democrats on the House Oversight Committee.Nearly 100,000 photos obtained by House Democrats from the estate of notorious sex predator Jeffrey Epstein include images of President Donald Trump, former President Bill Clinton, Microsoft founder Bill Gates, film director Woody Allen, and former Trump White House advisor Steve Bannon and others in social settings.Democrats on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, as they made 19 of those photos public, urged the Department of Justice to release investigative files it has related to Epstein ahead of the Dec. 19 deadline to do so to comply with a newly passed law.One image among a batch of photos released Friday morning shows Trump standing in the middle of a row of six women, whose faces were covered over by the Democrats before release. Some of the women are wearing Hawaiian leis around their necks. Trump is shown in another photo standing behind Epstein at what appears to be a social event. A third photo shows Trump sitting next to a woman, whose face is blacked out, on what appears to be a plane.Trump was a longtime friend of Epstein before the two men had a falling out sometime in the early 2000s. He has not been accused of any wrongdoing in connection with Epstein, and has denied knowledge of Epstein's abuse of girls and women while they were friends.\"Well, I haven't seen it, but I mean, everybody knew this man,\" Trump said at the White House on Friday evening when asked about the photos of him and others being released.\"He was all over Palm Beach. He has photos with everybody. I mean, almost there are hundreds and hundreds of people that have photos with him,\" Trump said.\"So that's no big deal.

    "body": "Today, Dick Van Dyke is officially 100 years old. Born on Dec. 13, 1925, the \"Mary Poppins\" actor took Hollywood by storm with his singing and dancing, and became an Emmy, Grammy and Tony award-winning legend. Now, Van Dyke has earned a new title: centenarian. Over the course of his life, the performer has shared the practices he follows to stay in the best of health.\"When you reach 100, a lot of things don't work too well,\" Van Dyke told The New York Times last month. But \"sometimes I feel like I'm 15 again.\"In his recent book, \"100 Rules for Living to 100: An Optimist's Guide to a Happy Life,\" published last month, Van Dyke explores his secrets for longevity even further. Here are three research-backed staples in his routine that he credits for his 100 years of life. How Dick Van Dyke stays active at 100, and his tips for a long, healthy life1. He moves his body oftenEven at 100, Van Dyke goes to the gym three times a week, he told the New York Times. When he makes his way to each machine, sometimes he dances as he walks, he said.On his off days from the gym, he practices yoga and stretches. Van Dyke said his doctors are amazed at how he's still able to touch his toes.Similar to Van Dyke, many Japanese centenarians — particularly in the blue zone, Okinawa, Japan — start their mornings with exercise. Typically they do a low-intensity workout that airs on the radio, called radio taiso, which is about three minutes long. The exercise also promotes a sense of community because participants tend to practice it alongside friends, colleagues or family.2. He has an optimistic outlook and doesn't turn down opportunities that excite him\"I've decided people are born with a certain personality and a certain outlook, a certain perspective,\" Van Dyke said in a sit-down interview with Al Roker for the TODAY show this November. \"I tend to look on the good side of things.\"Keeping a sense of playfulness in his life helps him experience a lot more fun, he said in his interview with The New York Times. Just last year, Van Dyke starred in Coldplay's music video for the song \"All My Love.\"In the Directors' Cut version of the video, Van Dyke spoke about how his career aligned with his desire to remain a kid at heart. He said he's \"one of those lucky people who got to do for a living what I would have done anyway.\"Often, the happiest centenarians pursue jobs that are fulfilling to them and don't retire. \"Think how lucky I am,\" he said. \"I got to do what I do — play and act silly.\"3. He values quality time with loved onesTowards the end of the \"All My Love\" music video, Van Dyke welcomes his children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren into frame to dance with him. The scene is a symbol of just how much he treasures spending time with his loved ones.Van Dyke is always looking for ways to get his grandchildren and great-grandchildren to enjoy their time at his house, so they want to come back and visit, he told The New York Times. He wants his backyard to resemble a theme park, and mentioned that he's planning to add a zip line next.\"Just hearing them all out there squealing gives me such joy,\" Van Dyke said.A decades-long study conducted by researchers at Harvard found that the key to happiness and longevity is social fitness, or maintaining healthy, long-lasting interpersonal connections.As far as his plans for his birthday today, Van Dyke's itinerary is very relaxed when squared with the major accomplishment of turning 100. Still, it aligns with spending quality time.\"He doesn't want to do anything,\" his wife Arlene Silver told People last week. \"He wants to be in his room watching Jeopardy! reruns with me.\"Want to give your kids the ultimate advantage?

    "body": "Neal Mohan, the CEO of YouTube speaks during a panel for the Summit for Democracy on March 30, 2023 in Washington, DC.Anna Moneymaker | Getty ImagesYouTube's CEO Neal Mohan is the latest in a line of tech bosses who have admitted to limiting their children's social media use, as the harms of being online for young people have become more evident. Mohan, who took the helm of YouTube's leadership in 2023, was just named Time's 2025 CEO of the Year. He said in an interview with the magazine that his children's use of media platforms is controlled and restricted. \"We do limit their time on YouTube and other platforms and other forms of media. On weekdays we tend to be more strict, on weekends we tend to be less so. We're not perfect by any stretch,\" Mohan said in one TikTok video posted by Time Magazine on Thursday. He stressed \"everything in moderation\" is what works best for him and his wife, and that extends to other online services and platforms. Mohan has three children: two sons and one daughter. Experts have continued to sound the alarm on how excessive smartphones and social media use has harmed children and teenagers. Jonathan Haidt, NYU professor and author of \"The Anxious Generation,\" has advocated for children to not have smartphones before the age of 14 and no access to social media before the age of 16.\"Let them have a flip phone, but remember, a smartphone isn't really a phone. They could make phone calls on it, but it's a multi-purpose device by which the world can get to your children,\" Haidt said in an interview with CNBC's Tania Bryer earlier this year.This week, Australia became the first country to formally bar users under the age of 16 from accessing major social media platforms. Ahead of the legislation's passage last year, a YouGov survey found that 77% of Australians backed the under-16 social media ban. Still, the rollout has faced some resistance since becoming law.Mohan said in a more extensive interview with Time on Wednesday that he feels a \"paramount responsibility\" to young people and giving parents greater control over how their kids use the platform. YouTube Kids was launched in 2015 as a child-friendly version of the Google-owned platform. He said his goal is  \"to make it easy for all parents\" to manage their children's YouTube use \"in a way that is suitable to their household,\" especially as every parent has a different approach. Bill Gates, Mark Cuban Several tech bosses have taken a similar approach. YouTube's former CEO Susan Wojcicki, also barred her children from browsing videos on the app, unless they were using YouTube Kids. She also limited the amount of time they spent on the platform. \"I allow my younger kids to use YouTube Kids, but I limit the amount of time that they're on it,\" Wojcicki told CNBC in 2019. \"I think too much of anything is not a good thing.\"Bill Gates, Microsoft's co-founder, is amongst the tech titans who are against allowing young people too much screen time. With three children, now adults, Gates openly talked about not giving them cell phones until they were in their teens. \"We don't have cell phones at the table when we are having a meal, we didn't give our kids cell phones until they were 14 and they complained other kids got them earlier,\" Gates said years ago. Meanwhile, billionaire Mark Cuban would even resort to installing Cisco routers and using management software to monitor which apps his children were on and shut off their phone activity.",

    "body": "In Disney's \"Zootopia 2,\" detectives Judy Hopps and Nick Wilde find themselves on the twisting trail of a mysterious reptile who turns the mammal metropolis of Zootopia upside down.DisneyThe Walt Disney Co. tallied its second billion-dollar film of 2025 with the help of a determined bunny and mischievous fox.\"Zootopia 2\" is set to top $1 billion at the global box office on Friday, according to company estimates, joining the live-action remake of \"Lilo & Stitch\" as the only Hollywood-made films to cross the benchmark this year. Heading into the weekend, the film had tallied $232.7 million domestically and $753.4 million from international markets.\"This milestone means the world to us, because more than anything, it means audiences are coming to theaters for a shared experience of watching this movie on the big screen, everyone together, from all walks of life around the world — and that is a Zootopia dream come true,\" Jared Bush, chief creative officer at Walt Disney Animation Studios, wrote in a statement Friday.The only other film to cross the billion-dollar threshold this year is China's \"Ne Zha 2,\" which has collected $2.2 billion since its release in January, according to data from Comscore.\"With the evolution of global market trends in recent years, reaching $1 billion has become a little more of a novelty again,\" Shawn Robbins, director of analytics at Fandango and founder of Box Office Theory, told CNBC. He also noted the importance of the film's \"staggering success in China.\" Nearly $450 million of the global haul for \"Zootopia 2\" has come from the region so far — a massive figure considering China has decreased the number of American films it permits to play in its theaters and has threatened to restrict even more because of escalated tariffs.\"Zootopia 2\" had the highest animated opening of all time for a non-local title in China and broke the record for highest-grossing non-local animated film of all time within five days of its release in the country, Disney reported.The film's billion-dollar haul also highlights a transition in the domestic theatrical marketplace. PG-rated family films have outperformed PG-13 and R-rated films at the box office in 2025. So far, PG films released this year have generated $2.7 billion in the U.S. and Canada, while PG-13 films have tallied $2.5 billion and R-rated films have collected $2.4 billion.This shift started in 2024, when PG-rated films sold more tickets domestically than any other rated film for the first time ever. PG-13 films had dominated the space for decades, according to data from Comscore. \"With PG-rated films, it is often the kids who make the decision as to whether to hit the multiplex, and their influence can be seen directly in the numbers for the category that have hit all-time highs over the past couple of years,\" said Paul Dergarabedian, head of marketplace trends at Comscore. \"Equally impressive is that most PG movie tickets sold are at a child-friendly lower price point and therefore reaching these huge box-office milestones is made even more impressive.\"Disclosure: Comcast is the parent company of Fandango and NBCUniversal, which owns CNBC. Versant would become the new parent company of Fandango and CNBC upon Comcast's planned spinoff of Versant.",

Its capabilities in complex portfolio management across both public and private markets include structured products, private credit, and derivatives.Stock Market Value: $6.37 billion ($21.76 per share)Stock Chart IconStock chart iconClearwater Analytics Holdings shares year to date.Activist: Starboard ValueOwnership: ~4.9%Average Cost: n/aActivist Commentary: Starboard is a very successful activist investor and has extensive experience helping companies focus on operational efficiency and margin improvement. They are known for their excellent diligence and for running many of the most successful campaigns. Starboard has initiated activist campaigns at 59 prior information technology companies and their average return on these situations is 36.92% versus an average of 20.01% for the Russell 2000 during the same time periods. Additionally, Starboard has taken a total of 163 prior activist campaigns in their history and has an average return of 21.26% versus 14.34% for the Russell 2000 over the same period.What's happeningOn Dec. 9, Starboard announced a nearly 5% position in Clearwater Analytics and is urging the company to run a robust sales process if it has received in-bound interest from potential buyers.Behind the scenesClearwater Analytics is a provider of front-to-back, cloud-based investment accounting solutions. The company has steadily taken share from legacy solutions, such as BlackRock, State Street and SS&C, as they are widely viewed as the premium modern platform. In 2016, private equity firm Welsh, Carson, Anderson & Stowe became the majority investor in the company. In 2020, Warburg Pincus and Permira made minority investments, and, about a year later, these three firms took the company public at $18 per share. Clearwater performed fairly well from its IPO through 2024, supported by consistent growth and historically strong margins that drove a premium valuation relative to peers, and these sponsors were rewarded accordingly. Warburg and Permira, which owned 22%, each sold their positions entirely and WCAS, which owned 56%, reduced its stake to roughly 1% by November 2024, at prices as high as $29.11 per share.Shortly thereafter, the company started making a string of acquisitions — a public company, Enfusion, and two private businesses, Beacon and Bistro. All of these transactions were announced between January and March of this year and closed within the following few months. The consequence of this is that Clearwater shifted from being a clean high-growth vertical software story with strong margins, a premium valuation, and a net cash balance, to a riskier, less certain integration story with leverage around 3x EBITDA. Unsurprisingly, the market questioned the company's decision to change course so sharply as well as its ability to integrate these three acquisitions while continuing to maintain its core organic growth story, and the stock sold off sharply, ultimately reaching a low of $15.73 per share after its third-quarter earnings report last month. Shortly thereafter, it was reported that Clearwater had engaged advisers to evaluate strategic options after receiving a bevy of unsolicited offers from firms like Thoma Bravo and even Warburg Pincus and Permira, both of whom still had representatives on the board. These announcements prompted Starboard to disclose its nearly 5% position in Clearwater and urge the company to run a robust sales process if it has received in-bound interest from potential buyers. But don't misunderstand Starboard's motive or thesis. They are not short-term strategic investors jumping on an opportunity for a quick return. They have likely been looking at Clearwater for many months and had owned it because they like the standalone story and see an opportunity to create long term value. But, to paraphrase the overused quote attributed to Mike Tyson (but really said by Cus D'Amato), everyone has a plan until they get hit. And Starboard is as good as anyone with rolling with the punches. So, when news surfaces that the company is considering a sale and that two of its board members may be bidders, Starboard is doing what any good activist would do and making sure there is a fair process to maximize value for shareholders. Starboard will then decide whether that price is better than the risk adjusted value shareholders could receive from a standalone plan of integrating the acquisitions and growing the core business. Moreover, a credible and fair process could likely attract additional bidders, including strategics such as BlackRock and Nasdaq. While the leveraged buyout math works in the high $20s per share, strategics could push it to a 3 handle.  There could be a quick resolution here if the board decides to sell to the company and receives a bid that is good for everyone. But that is a risky activist thesis on its own. What makes this a good activist campaign for Starboard is that they are a believer in the company as a standalone entity and see a path to create shareholder value. If the standalone path is ultimately pursued, it would make a lot of sense for the private equity investors who no longer own any material position to resign from the board and be replaced with industry experts and a shareholder representative who can guide management through a standalone plan. Essentially, there are three potential outcomes to Clearwater's current inflection point: (i) a standalone plan where the company integrates its acquisitions and grows its core; (ii) a sale of the company for a satisfactory premium following a real and competitive review process; or (iii) an abbreviated sale process orchestrated in part by Warburg and Permira resulting in a sale to Warburg and Permira. Starboard would likely be happy with (i) or (ii) and we expect them to do everything within their power to prevent (iii).Ken Squire is the founder and president of 13D Monitor, an institutional research service on shareholder activism, and the founder and portfolio manager of the 13D Activist Fund, a mutual fund that invests in a portfolio of activist investments.",

    "body": "Feature China | Future Publishing | Getty ImagesCoinbase is gearing up to launch an in-house prediction market, powered by Kalshi, a source close to the matter told CNBC — a strategic play to expand the number of asset classes available on the cryptocurrency exchange at a time when some investors are shying away from digital assets.The source said Coinbase and Kalshi will formally announce the prediction market soon, with news potentially coming as early as next week. The partnership is not exclusive, but Kalshi will be the only prediction markets operator working with Coinbase when the product launches, according to the source. Rumblings of the prediction market launch have swirled for nearly a month. An alleged screenshot of Coinbase's prediction markets dashboard shared by Silicon Valley researcher Jane Manchun Wong in an X post dated Nov. 18 offered some clues about the new product. The Information first reported on Nov. 19 that Coinbase planned to launch prediction markets powered by Kalshi, adding that the exchange would unveil the new product at its \"Coinbase System Update\" event on Dec. 17. Bloomberg published a similar report on Thursday, citing a source familiar with the matter, adding that Coinbase would also announce a tokenized stock offering at the showcase. Coinbase declined to confirm the reports to CNBC, but said to tune into its event next week. The firm did not comment on a timeline for when its prediction markets would go live for its users. Coinbase's upcoming product launches underscore its push to refashion itself into an \"everything exchange,\" or a one-stop shop for trading all kinds of assets, including crypto tokens, tokenized stocks and event contracts. In May, CEO Brian Armstrong articulated that \"everything exchange\" vision to investors, saying Coinbase would aim to become a top financial services app within the next decade. The trading platform is setting its sights on that goal as it faces intensifying competition from rivals such as Robinhood, Gemini and Kraken. All three have launched tokenized equity offerings to users outside of the U.S. within the past year, in addition to exploring prediction markets to varying extents. Coinbase's moves to expand the financial instruments available to its users also come as investor sentiment on digital assets cools. A series of liquidations of highly leveraged digital asset positions in mid-October triggered several pullbacks in the crypto market, prompting investors to rotate out of tokens and into gold and other safe-haven assets. Bitcoin fell as low as around $85,000 in early December, hitting its lowest level since last March. The token was last trading at $89,951, down 23% in the past three months. Coinbase has also fallen more than 16%  over the past three months. The deal also underscores U.S.-based prediction markets operator Kalshi's push to embed its event contracts into various brokerages, widening its reach as the prediction markets space becomes increasingly competitive. This year, Kalshi embedded several of its prediction markets into trading platform Robinhood, as part of a non-exclusive partnership between the companies. Kalshi has also engaged in talks with several other major brokerages, including those in the crypto industry, with the aim of closing more deals like the ones it has struck with Robinhood and now Coinbase, a source familiar with the matter told CNBC.",

    "body": "A tract of new tightly packed homes are viewed along the Boulder City Parkway on January 11, 2022 in Henderson, Nevada.George Rose | Getty ImagesHome values have been losing ground for much of this year, with previously huge annual gains shrinking to nothing. The result is that homeowners are losing equity.Borrower equity fell 2.1% in the third quarter of this year compared with the same period a year ago, or a collective $373.8 billion, according to a report from Cotality. This comes after years of steep gains in home prices and record equity. Even after the drop, homeowners still have an overall collective net equity of $17.1 trillion for homes with a mortgage. For the average homeowner, the third-quarter equity declines translate to a loss of $13,400. In addition, the number of homes in a negative equity position, meaning they are worth less than the mortgage on them, increased by 21% from a year ago to 1.2 million. \"As the pace of home price growth slows and markets recalibrate from pandemic peaks, we're seeing a clear shift in equity trends,\" said Selma Hepp, chief economist at Cotality. \"Negative equity is on the rise, driven in part by affordability challenges that have led many first-time and lower-income buyers to over-leverage through piggyback loans or minimal down payments.\"Get Property Play directly to your inboxCNBC's Property Play with Diana Olick covers new and evolving opportunities for the real estate investor, delivered weekly to your inbox.Subscribe here to get access today.Those in a negative equity position likely purchased their homes more recently, when mortgage rates were higher and prices had peaked. Homeowners have also been pulling more equity out of their homes, thanks to huge gains in the past five years. Home values are now roughly 52% higher than they were in January 2020, according to the S&P Cotality Case-Shiller national home price index. Even after mortgage rates increased in 2023, the average equity gain per homeowner was $25,000. In 2024, it was $4,900. Not every market, however, is seeing the same dynamic. Boston, Chicago and New York are all still in the positive, according to the Cotality report. The biggest losses were in Los Angeles, San Francisco, Washington, Miami and Houston, Texas.\"The future performance of highly leveraged loans will hinge on the strength of the U.S. economy and labor market,\" Hepp said. \"Even as expectations for continued price appreciation and economic resilience persist, it remains critical to closely monitor these loans in the months ahead.\"",

    "body": "Open AI CEO Sam Altman speaks during a talk session with SoftBank Group CEO Masayoshi Son at  an event titled \"Transforming Business through AI\" in Tokyo, Japan, on February 03, 2025. Tomohiro Ohsumi | Getty ImagesOn Dec. 11, 2015, OpenAI launched as a nonprofit research lab after Elon Musk and a group of prominent techies, including Peter Thiel and Reid Hoffman, pledged $1 billion to develop artificial intelligence for the benefit of humanity. The idea was for the project to be be free of commercial pressures and the pursuit of money. A decade later, that founding mission is all but forgotten. Musk, now the world's richest person, is long gone, having created rival startup xAI. And he's been engaged in a heated legal and public relations fight with OpenAI CEO and co-founder Sam Altman. Far from the nonprofit realm, OpenAI has emerged as one of the fastest-growing commercial entities on the planet, zooming to a $500 billion private market valuation, with almost all of that value accruing since the company's launch of ChatGPT three years ago. More than 800 million people now use the chatbot every week. Musk's xAI, meanwhile, is expected to close a $15 billion round at a $230 billion pre-money valuation this month, sources familiar with the matter told CNBC's David Faber in late November.OpenAI and xAI are two of the main companies, along with Google, Anthropic and Meta, pouring money into AI models, as the market rapidly evolves from text-based chatbots to AI-generated videos and more advanced compute-intensive forms of content, as well as into agentic AI, with large enterprises customizing tools to enhance productivity. For OpenAI, the price tag is almost incomprehensible: $1.4 trillion and growing. That's primarily for the mammoth data centers and high-powered chips required to meet what the company sees as insatiable demand for its technology. For now, OpenAI is a cash-burning machine going up against tech's megacaps and their chip suppliers, drawing comparisons to earlier waves of high-growth tech firms that spent heavily for years to challenge behemoth incumbents, but to mixed results.\"OpenAI has a very big role in the in the history of the development of artificial intelligence, and will forever have that role,\" said Gil Luria, an equity analyst at D.A. Davidson, in an interview. \"Now, will that role be Netscape, or will it be Google? We've yet to find out.\" Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang speaks at an event ahead of the COMPUTEX forum, in Taipei, Taiwan, June 2, 2024.Ann Wang | ReutersIt's a position that would've been hard to imagine in 2016, when Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang hauled a black DGX-1 supercomputer up to OpenAI's offices in San Francisco's Mission District. The $300,000 machine had cost Nvidia \"a few billion dollars\" to develop, and there were no other buyers, Huang recalled recently on Joe Rogan's podcast.  Musk, at OpenAI, was the only one who wanted it.When Musk told him it was for \"a nonprofit company,\" Huang said all the blood drained from his face at the thought of parking such a costly box inside an organization that wasn't meant to make money.Behind the scenes, though, the nonprofit ideal was already under intense strain, and Musk didn't like what he saw. \"Guys, I've had enough. This is the final straw,\" Musk wrote in an email to his co-founders in 2017. He warned that he would \"no longer fund OpenAI\" if it turned into a tech startup instead of a nonprofit. Altman wrote back the next morning: \"i remain enthusiastic about the non-profit structure!\"Altman vs. MuskIn February of the following year, Musk left the OpenAI board, and said at the time the move was to avoid a potential conflict of interest as his car company, Tesla, dove deeper into AI. The story was more complicated.Musk sued OpenAI and Altman in early 2024, alleging they abandoned the company's founding mission to develop AI \"for the benefit of humanity broadly,\" and he's regularly criticized OpenAI's close ties to Microsoft, its principal backer. He also went to court to try and keep OpenAI from converting into a for-profit entity and, earlier this year, went so far as to try and acquire the AI lab for $97.4 billion. In October, OpenAI announced it had completed a recapitalization, cementing its structure as a nonprofit with a controlling stake in its for-profit business, which is now a public benefit corporation called OpenAI Group PBC.watch nowMusk isn't the only early OpenAI team member who's turned into a bitter rival. Siblings Dario and Daniela Amodei left OpenAI in late 2020 to form Anthropic, which said last month that Microsoft and Nvidia would invest in the company. The valuation from the funding round could reach as high as $350 billion.Anthropic's Claude family of large language models is one of the biggest competitors to OpenAI's GPT models. Altman is wagering that he can win the race by outspending the competition. While his company has sketched out plans for a trillion-dollar-plus AI infrastructure outlay, Anthropic has made roughly $100 billion in recent compute commitments, spaced out at various intervals over the next few years.It all amounts to a giant bet that demand for AI services will continue apace. \"We've got all the various AI vendors making these huge capital investments,\" said David Menninger, executive director of software research at ISG. \"There's a question as to how long those capital investments continue and whether or not they all pan out.\"Luria says Anthropic and others are making reasonable commitments based on their current growth trajectory and the funding they've already secured. But he said OpenAI's approach has been based on a \"fantastical set of commitments\" with a \"faint belief that those numbers are even possible.\" 'Pretty extreme'Altman told CNBC in an interview on Thursday that OpenAI is already seeing enough demand to justify its spending plans, which \"makes us confident that we will be able to significantly ramp revenue.\"\"It's obviously unusual to be growing this fast at this kind of scale, but it is what we see in our current data,\" Altman said, adding that \"the demand in the market is pretty extreme.\" Altman said last month that he expects annualized revenue to hit $20 billion by the end of this year and to reach hundreds of billions by 2030. Its historic pace of growth has been a big boon for major tech companies. Oracle signed a roughly $500 billion deal to sell infrastructure services to OpenAI over five years. Chipmakers Advanced Micro Devices and Broadcom have woven OpenAI-linked demand into multi-year forecasts. But Oracle's shares plunged 11% on Thursday after the software vendor reported weaker-than-expected revenue, a miss that dragged down Nvidia, CoreWeave and other AI-related stocks. Despite a surge in long-term contract commitments from companies like OpenAI, Meta, and Nvidia, investors are growing concerned about Oracle's debt load that's fueling its buildout. watch nowStill, venture capitalist Matt Murphy of Menlo Ventures, said that in his 25 years in the venture business, \"this is the mother of all waves.\"Murphy, an early investor in Anthropic, said the combination of AI models, custom chips and hyperscale data centers adds up to the potential for trillion-dollar outcomes. That explains the eye-popping level of capital expenditures and the astronomical valuations, he said.Altman recently declared a \"code red\" inside his company, and shuffled resources to focus on making ChatGPT faster, more reliable and more personal, while delaying work on ads, health and shopping agents and a personal assistant called Pulse. His declaration came after Google released its Gemini 3 model last month, further accelerating the search giant's ascent in the market. On Thursday, OpenAI unveiled ChatGPT-5.2, a faster, more capable reasoning model that the company says is its best system yet for everyday professional use. It also struck a three-year, $1 billion content and equity deal with Disney around the Sora AI video generator.Altman downplayed the threat from Google, telling CNBC that Gemini had less of an impact on the company's metrics than OpenAI initially feared. \"I believe that when a competitive threat happens, you want to focus on it, deal with it quickly,\" Altman said.He said he expects the company to exit code red by January.— CNBC's Kif Leswing contributed to this report.watch now",

    "body": "Oracle CEO Clay Magouyrk appears on a media tour of the Stargate AI data center in Abilene, Texas, on Sept. 23, 2025.Kyle Grillot | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesOracle on Friday pushed back against a report that said the company will complete data centers for OpenAI, one of its major customers, in 2028, rather than 2027.The delay is due to a shortage of labor and materials, according to the Friday report from Bloomberg, which cited unnamed people. Oracle shares closed down more than 4% on Friday. \"Site selection and delivery timelines were established in close coordination with OpenAI following execution of the agreement and were jointly agreed,\" an Oracle spokesperson said in an email to CNBC. \"There have been no delays to any sites required to meet our contractual commitments, and all milestones remain on track.\"The Oracle spokesperson did not specify a timeline for turning on cloud computing infrastructure for OpenAI. In September, OpenAI said it had a partnership with Oracle worth more than $300 billion over the next five years. \"We have a good relationship with OpenAI,\" Clay Magouyrk, one of Oracle's two newly appointed CEOs, said at an October analyst meeting.Doing business with OpenAI is relatively new to 48-year-old Oracle. Historically, Oracle grew through sales of its database software and business applications. Its cloud infrastructure business now contributes over one-fourth of revenue, although Oracle remains a smaller hyperscaler than Amazon, Microsoft and Google. OpenAI has also made commitments to other companies as it looks to meet expected capacity needs. In September, Nvidia said it had signed a letter of intent with OpenAI to deploy at least 10 gigawatts of Nvidia equipment for the San Francisco artificial intelligence startup. The first phase of that project is expected in the second half of 2026.Nvidia and OpenAI said in a September statement that they \"look forward to finalizing the details of this new phase of strategic partnership in the coming weeks.\"But no announcement has come yet.In a November filing, Nvidia said \"there is no assurance that we will enter into definitive agreements with respect to the OpenAI opportunity.\"OpenAI has historically relied on Nvidia graphics processing units to operate ChatGPT and other products, and now it's also looking at designing custom chips in a collaboration with Broadcom. On Thursday, Broadcom CEO Hock Tan laid out a timeline for the OpenAI work, which was announced in October. Broadcom and OpenAI said they had signed a term sheet.\"It's more like 2027, 2028, 2029, 10 gigawatts, that was the OpenAI discussion,\" Tan said on Broadcom's earnings call. \"And that's, I call it, an agreement, an alignment of where we're headed with respect to a very respected and valued customer, OpenAI. But we do not expect much in 2026.\"OpenAI declined to comment.WATCH: Oracle says there have been 'no delays' in OpenAI arrangement after stock slidewatch now",

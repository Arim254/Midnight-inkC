(Photo by Press Information Bureau (PIB)/Anadolu via Getty Images)Anadolu | Anadolu | Getty ImagesIndia said it plans to double bilateral trade with the UAE to $200 billion by 2032, in a step toward diversifying its partnerships as a deal with the Asian country's biggest trading partner, the U.S., remains elusive.In a whirlwind, three-hour long meeting late Monday between UAE's President Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in New Delhi, both countries' state-owned companies signed a 10-year liquefied natural gas supply agreement. Under the deal, the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company, which is owned by the Abu Dhabi government, will supply LNG worth up to $3 billion for a period of 10 years, starting 2028, to India's state-owned Hindustan Petroleum Corporation. With this deal, India is now UAE's largest customer of LNG and will account for 20% of sales by 2029, ADNOC said in a release.Both countries also discussed \"a wide range of issues aimed at further strengthening the multifaceted India-UAE friendship,\" Prime Minister Modi said in a post on X.\"It was a productive visit in terms of outcome,\" said Harsh Pant, vice president for studies and foreign policy at New Delhi-based think tank Observer Research Foundation told CNBC's Inside India.He added that India-UAE ties have evolved to a point where \"regular high-level interaction at relatively short notice is going to become more common\".Trade between India and UAE touched $100 billion in fiscal year 2025. Both countries signed the Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement in 2022.India is the Middle Eastern country's second-largest trading partner, accounting for nearly 9% of its total trade and 14% of non-oil exports as of September 2025, according to India Brand Equity Foundation, an initiative backed by the commerce ministry. UAE was India's third largest trading partner after the U.S. and China in fiscal year 2025, and is home to 3.5 million Indian expatriates.Diversifying alliesIndia's plan to expand its trade with UAE comes at a time when the country's exports to the U.S. are under pressure owing to the 50% tariff imposed by Washington on Indian goods since August last year.\"Even with a trade deal [with the U.S.] there is no guarantee that President Trump's \"unpredictability would end,\" said Pant, adding that it is the reason that India has been reaching out to finalise trade deal with other countries.Last year, following the U.S. tariffs, India entered trade pacts with the UK and Oman, and said it will sign a deal with New Zealand in the first half of 2026.",

    "body": "Sopa Images | Lightrocket | Getty ImagesNetflix will report its fourth-quarter earnings after the bell on Tuesday, with questions surrounding its pending acquisition of Warner Bros. Discovery's assets top of mind for investors. In recent years Netflix's quarterly reports have been mostly steady -- with the exception of a miss on earnings estimates last quarter, related to a unique one-time charge. Netflix stopped reporting subscriber numbers in early 2025 — when it said it had more than 300 million global subscribers — and has instead focused on its strategy shift toward growing its advertising-supported business. For several quarters, Wall Street has been particularly focused on that ad-supported business, any effects of recent price increases on the subscriber base, and Netflix's content pipeline. Here's how the company is expected to perform for in its fourth quarter according to analysts polled by LSEG:Earnings per share: 55 cents, according to LSEGRevenue: $11.97 billion, according to LSEGThis quarter's financials, however, are likely to be overshadowed by Netflix's announcement in December that it had agreed to acquire Warner Bros. Discovery's streaming and film studio assets for $27.75 per WBD share, or an equity value of $72 billion.The proposed acquisition came as a shock to the market as the streaming giant has long stayed away from industry consolidation and mega deals. \"Q4 was a big flex for Netflix, marked by bolder swings to drive growth beyond its core,\" said Mike Proulx, vice president and research director at Forrester. \"That's notable for a company that touts itself as more builders than buyers. Yet Netflix's Q4 actions say otherwise.\" Since the announcement, Netflix's stock has fallen in response. Since October, when Netflix was first rumored to be interested in the assets, the company's stock dropped nearly 30%. And the potential acquisition has not been without its bumps. Soon after announcing the deal with Netflix, Paramount Skydance launched a hostile effort to buy all of WBD. As Paramount's pressure to acquire WBD has ramped up, Netflix this week amended its offer to be all-cash. Meanwhile, there's also been questions about whether Netflix's acquisition of WBD would receive necessary regulatory approval. \"2026 will be a defining year for Netflix. If the Warner Bros. deal actually happens, it will reposition a newly beefed‑up Netflix, not just within the streaming market, but across the entertainment industry at large. But that fight is only the beginning. Expect lots more drama as the bidding war plays out this year,\" Proulx said. This story is developing. Please check back for updates. ",

    "body": "A Netflix building in Hollywood, California, Dec. 17, 2025.Zeng Hui | Xinhua News Agency | Getty ImagesNetflix has adjusted its offer for Warner Bros. Discovery's studio and streaming assets to an all-cash bid, according to an SEC filing Tuesday. Netflix now plans to pay $27.75 per WBD share entirely in cash to acquire WBD's streaming platform HBO Max and the Warner Bros. film studio. The two companies initially reached a deal in December, composed of a combination of cash and stock at an equity value of $72 billion. \"The WBD Board continues to support and unanimously recommend our transaction, and we are confident that it will deliver the best outcome for stockholders, consumers, creators and the broader entertainment community,\" said Ted Sarandos, co-CEO of Netflix, said in a release on Tuesday. \"Our revised all-cash agreement will enable an expedited timeline to a stockholder vote and provide greater financial certainty at $27.75 per share in cash, plus the value from the planned separation of Discovery Global,\" Sarandos said in the release.CNBC's David Faber and other media outlets reported last week that Netflix was likely to make the adjustment as Paramount Skydance continues to build up pressure in its hostile takeover attempt for the entirety of WBD, which also includes cable TV networks such as CNN and TNT. With the offer amendment, the timeline for shareholder approval could shift to as early as late February or early March, Faber reported last week, citing sources familiar with the matter. Previously, shareholders were expected to vote on the deal in the spring or early summer.WBD's board unanimously accepted the amended Netflix offer, according to Tuesday's filing. The board has twice recommended that shareholders reject Paramount's hostile bid in favor of the Netflix transaction. Paramount recently sued for information in its hostile pursuit of WBD and has also launched a proxy fight, informing WBD shareholders that it intends to nominate directors for election to the Warner Bros. Discovery board at the company's annual 2026 meeting. On Tuesday WBD also filed a preliminary proxy statement seeking shareholder approval for its deal with Netflix. If the deal were to be approved, WBD's cable TV networks would be spun off into a new, publicly traded entity known as Discovery Global. If the deal were to be approved, the separation is expected to be completed in six to nine months, prior to the closing of the transaction between Netflix and WBD. Netflix reports earnings after the bell Tuesday, and investors will be looking for further updates on the sale process.",

    "body": "U.S. President Donald Trump and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer hold a press conference following their meeting at Chequers, near Aylesbury, Britain, Sept. 18, 2025. Kevin Lamarque | ReutersU.S. President Donald Trump has taken aim at another NATO ally on the eve of his appearance at the World Economic Forum in Davos this week, this time lambasting the U.K.The so-called \"special relationship\" between the U.S. and U.K., and President Donald Trump and Prime Minister Keir Starmer, was left looking bruised on Tuesday after Trump posted a tirade against London's decision to hand sovereignty of the Chagos Islands to Mauritius.The islands include Diego Garcia where a joint U.K.-U.S. military base is stationed. The deal, which was agreed in May 2025, saw the British government agree to hand sovereignty to Mauritius, but to lease the military base on Diego Garcia for £101 million ($135.7 million) a year. The White House voiced its support for the deal last year but, on Tuesday, Trump said it was \"an act of great stupidity.\"\"Shockingly, our \"brilliant\" NATO Ally, the United Kingdom, is currently planning to give away the Island of Diego Garcia, the site of a vital U.S. Military Base, to Mauritius, and to do so FOR NO REASON WHATSOEVER,\" Trump posted on social media platform Truth Social early Tuesday.The president said China and Russia would view this act as one of \"total weakness,\" and that they were international powers that only recognized strength. \"The U.K. giving away extremely important land is an act of GREAT STUPIDITY, and is another in a very long line of National Security reasons why Greenland has to be acquired.\"He added that Denmark and its European allies, who oppose Trump's takeover bid, had to \"do the right thing.\"Responding to Trump's comments, a U.K. government spokesman said Tuesday that \"the U.K. will never compromise on our national security.\"\"We acted because the base on Diego Garcia was under threat after court decisions undermined our position and would have prevented it operating as intended in future,\" he added, according to comments published by BBC News.Rift among alliesTrump's comments come amid a growing rift between the U.S. and its European NATO allies, including the U.K. and France, over the president's incessant pursuit of Greenland, a Danish territory in the Arctic.Greenland, Denmark, and European leaders have said the island is not for sale, but Trump has not ruled out using military force to seize the territory if necessary. He has also threatened eight European NATO allies with escalating tariffs if they continue to block his takeover bid.The U.K. is the second NATO ally to be lambasted by Trump in as many days, with the president threatening to impose 200% tariffs on French wines and Champagne on Monday after French President Emmanuel Macron reportedly turned down a seat on Trump's \"Board of Peace\" for Gaza.The U.K. has tried to defuse tensions between the U.S. and Europe, calling for cool heads and further discussions over Greenland.In a press conference Monday, Starmer said that Britain greatly values its long-standing special relationship with the U.S., but that only Greenland and Denmark can decide the island's future.People bear Greenlandic flags as they gather in front of the U.S. consulate  protest against U.S. President Donald Trump and his announced intent to acquire Greenland on January 17, 2026 in Nuuk, Greenland. Sean Gallup | Getty Images News | Getty Images\"On Greenland, the right way to approach an issue of this seriousness is through calm discussion between allies,\" Starmer said at a press conference in Downing Street, the PM's official residence.\"But there is a principle here that cannot be set aside, because it goes to the heart of how stable and trusted international cooperation works, so any decision about the future status of Greenland belongs to the people of Greenland and the Kingdom of Denmark alone,\" he added.Starmer spoke to Trump on Sunday night, telling him he was wrong to threaten to impose fresh tariffs on NATO allies if they didn't agree to his demands to \"buy\" Greenland.Starmer and Trump have always seemed to enjoy a warm and respectful relationship, despite their political differences.The U.K. was the first country to strike a trade deal with Washington last year, largely owing to Trump's apparent warmth toward the country. The U.S. president enjoyed all the pomp and pageantry the U.K. could muster during a state visit last fall.",

Natural gas is used primarily for heating and electricity generation.\"Frigid weather is set to reshape the near-term natural gas outlook as Arctic air masses flash across the eastern US and the huge weather demand gain over the MLK weekend threatens severe market dislocation,\" EBW Analytics told clients in a Tuesday note. A big winter storm is forecast to dump heavy snow, sleet and treacherous freezing rain across the southern Rockies, the Plains and the South by Friday, according to the National Weather Service. The storm is then expected to shift toward the East Coast through the weekend. Much of the U.S. was already gripped by frigid temperatures Tuesday morning. The weather will threaten production freeze-offs, according to EBW Analytics. \"The frigid weather pivot comes with speculator short positions at a 14-month high — suggesting further bullish risks as shorts are forced to buy back gas,\" the group told clients. \"Volatility will stay high, however — and any weather model warming into mid-February could allow a near term price spike to eventually soften,\" the group said.

Etienne Laurent | AFP | Getty ImagesDETROIT — Five years after the transatlantic automaker Stellantis was formed through a merger, the business hasn't necessarily panned out as investors hoped.U.S. shares of the company — created through a $52 billion combination of Italian American automaker Fiat Chrysler and France-based Groupe PSA on Jan. 16, 2021 — are down roughly 43% in the past five years. Italian-listed shares also are off roughly 40%.Since the combined company's stock debuted on the New York Stock Exchange on Jan. 19, 2021, days after the merger was completed, shares of the automaker were largely in the black — up as high as 74% in March 2024 — until Stellantis reported troubling financial results that year amid cost-cutting efforts meant to support higher profits and its multibillion-dollar push into electric vehicles.Many of those plans are being altered or eliminated under new Stellantis CEO Antonio Filosa, who succeeded Carlos Tavares last summer. Tavares, a longtime automotive executive, was largely credited with forming the company, but abruptly left Stellantis in December 2024.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconStellantis shares listed in the U.S. and Italy.Filosa is executing a sales turnaround plan for the automaker and is particularly focused on its Jeep and Ram brands regaining U.S. market share following yearslong sales declines.\"The strategy that we have in front of us is a strong one and will lead us to growth if we execute well,\" he told reporters Wednesday during the Detroit Auto Show. \"So, I believe it's a year of execution.\"Filosa did not rule out the possibility of regionally refocusing or shrinking the company's vast portfolio of brands that also includes Italian nameplates Fiat and Alfa Romeo, which have not performed well domestically.He said he believes the company should \"stay together\" following some speculation, including from Tavares, that it would be better to sell off assets or brands.Filosa said the next step in the company's plans will come during a meeting this month with more than 200 company executives that will focus on an upcoming capital markets day as well as company culture and 2026 execution.PSA CEO Carlos Tavares and FCA CEO Mike Manley shake hands after signing a combination agreement that will lead to the creation of the world's fourth-largest global automaker in terms of annual sales (8.7 million vehicles).FCAInvestors have been eager to hear a new strategy for Stellantis after Tavares' exit. He left amid troubling sales and financial results as the company strived to achieve 10% or greater profit margins and doubling net revenues under his \"Dare Forward 2030\" business plan.U.S. shares of Stellantis since Filosa began as CEO on June 23 are up 2%. They closed Friday at $9.60 per share, down 4.2%. Filosa this week declined to discuss the company's past mistakes, but company executives previously told CNBC that Tavares' fixation on cost reductions and profits hurt business, as well as the company's products, employees and relationships with suppliers, unions and dealers.Filosa has spent much of his time attempting to repair those bonds, especially with the company's distraught U.S. franchised retailers. He's also approved drastic changes to the company's product plans, including reducing prices and reprioritizing products away from electrified vehicles.\"In the six months, I see the changes that we will make we need to make to create the bright future that we need,\" he said regarding his tenure thus far as CEO.

    "body": "Traders work at the New York Stock Exchange, in New York, Jan. 16, 2026.NYSETechnology shares led the declines in U.S. stocks Tuesday as investors reacted to escalating tariff rhetoric tied to President Donald Trump's renewed push around Greenland.The State Street Technology Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLK) fell 1%. Nvidia and Tesla each fell nearly 3%, while Meta Platforms, Alphabet, Apple, Microsoft and Amazon all lost more than 1%.Those moves put pressure on the broader market. The Nasdaq Composite was last trading 1.3% lower, lagging the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average which were respectively down 1.1% and 0.9%.Markets were rattled after Trump threatened new tariffs on countries opposing the sale of Greenland to the United States, saying in a Truth Social post that levies could begin at 10% in February and rise to 25% by June. The president also floated steep tariffs on French goods and criticized European allies, fueling concerns about a wider trade escalation between the U.S. and the European Union.The renewed trade tensions come as global leaders gather at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, this week, with investors watching closely for signs that negotiations could cool tensions. But Wedbush analyst Dan Ives isn't overly concerned. \"Tech stocks will be hit as the 'risk off dynamic' hits AI names front and center but ultimately we view this as an opportunity to own the tech winners for 2026 and beyond,\" Ives wrote. \"The back and forth war of words between Trump and the EU will give investors another opportunity to own the tech winners and despite the bears always trying to yell fire in a crowded theater. ... the AI Revolution is still in the early days of playing out and this soap opera this week is not changing that dynamic in our view as the 4th Industrial Revolution hits its next stage of growth in 2026.\"Ives added that an upcoming catalyst could be a \"robust\" fourth-quarter earnings season expected from tech stalwarts over the next few weeks, with around $550 billion in capital expenditures fueling the next stage of the AI revolution. He listed stocks such as Nvidia, Microsoft, Palantir, CrowdStrike, Nebius, Apple, Palo Alto, Google and Tesla as names he would buy amid current market weakness.",

    "body": "watch nowAfter months of speculation and political intrigue, President Donald Trump is close to nominating the next chair of the Federal Reserve, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Tuesday.The president has whittled down the field to four candidates to succeed current Chair Jerome Powell and a decision is forthcoming, Bessent told CNBC during an interview at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.\"My guess is the president will reach a decision maybe as soon as next week,\" he said during the \"Squawk Box\" interview. \"We've had substantial conversations about this. We've run a process that started in September — 11 very strong candidates. We're now down to four candidates. The president has personally met with all of them, and it's going to be his decision.\"Bessent did not name the four finalists, though previous comments have indicated a field of five that included National Economic Council director Kevin Hassett, former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh, current Governors Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman and BlackRock's chief fixed income strategist, Rick Rieder.Prediction markets have honed in on Hassett, Warsh and Waller, though White House officials have said Rieder also met with Trump, and he has gotten more interest. Recently, Warsh has become the front-runner on Kalshi, with Rieder and Waller trailing, following comments from Trump that he'd prefer Hassett stay in his current role.Bessent has run the screening process but did not indicate a personal preference. White House officials including Trump and the Treasury secretary have regularly criticized Powell both for his stewardship of monetary policy and setting of interest rates, as well as the way he has run the institution in general. Recent developments have seen the Justice Department subpoena Powell relating to the renovation project at Fed headquarters.Trump nominated Powell for the position in 2017, and former President Joe Biden reappointed him.\"Look, I think the Fed's monetary policy independence is very important. I think that a lot of the issues around the independence are being created by the other things that are happening,\" Bessent said. \"Under Chair Powell's watch, we will have seen between four to six governors and presidents have to resign for ethical issues. That's out of 19. If that happened at a Wall Street firm, the CEO would be out.\"Multiple Fed officials, and most recently Governor Adriana Kugler, either have retired or resigned after running afoul of ethics guidelines on investing. \"The independence does not mean lack of accountability. The Fed has a special obligation to the American people because it influences their lives,\" Bessent said.Though Powell's chair term runs out in May, he will have the option to stay on as governor until 2028.

But it also comes as tensions escalate between the U.S. and Denmark after Trump's latest threats to tariff European countries if Greenland, an arctic territory of Denmark, isn't sold to the U.S.\"It is not directly related to the ongoing rift between the [U.S.] and Europe, but of course that didn't make it more difficult to take the decision,\" Schelde said in a statement to CNBC.The fund currently has a position of around $100 million in U.S. Treasurys, an AkademikerPension spokesperson confirmed to CNBC. The academics-focused fund plans to have exited that holding by the end of the month.Schelde chiefly cited the ballooning debt bill facing the U.S. after decades of government overspending. The U.S. recorded a budget shortfall of $1.78 trillion last year, down just over 2% from 2024's fiscal year as Trump's broad and steep tariffs took effect.Moody's Ratings cut the United States' sovereign credit rating down to Aa1 from Aaa in May, citing the budget deficit and high borrowing costs associated with rolling over debt at lofty interest rates.The U.S.' finances made \"us think that we need to make an effort to find an alternative way of conducting our liquidity and risk management,\" Schelde said. \"Now we have found such a way and we [are] executing on that.\"Denmark has grown increasingly hostile toward the U.S. as Trump has ratcheted up his calls for control of Greenland to be given to the U.S. Trump said over the weekend that he would institute tariffs on several European nations beginning Feb. 1 if the U.S. did not take control of Greenland and that those levies could rise to 25% on June 1.European leaders have reportedly considered using counter-tariffs and other punitive economic measures as a result. Some investors have worried that European countries could dump their U.S. asset holdings in response to Trump's new tariffs.Greenland Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen said Monday that it would \"not be pressured\" and \"stand firm on dialogue, on respect and on international law.\"Treasury yields in the U.S. and abroad surged Tuesday, a sign of investors feeling geopolitical turmoil rising. The U.S. dollar and stocks fell, and gold rose to new all-time highs in a session defined by the \"sell America\" trade.Bridgewater Associates founder Ray Dalio told CNBC on Tuesday that sovereign funds could start to dump U.S. investments if they stop seeing the U.S. as a stable trading partner.\"On the other side of trade, deficits, and trade wars, there are capital and capital wars,\" Dalio told CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. \"If you take the conflicts, you can't ignore the possibility of the capital wars. In other words, maybe there's not the same inclination to buy ... U.S. debt and so on.\"Reuters first reported the Danish pension fund's Treasury exit.",

    "body": "President Donald Trump speaks as he meets with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington, Oct. 22, 2025.Kevin Lamarque | ReutersThe looming U.S. Supreme Court ruling on President Donald Trump's tariffs could affect Trump's threats to levy new tariffs on NATO members over the issue of Greenland's sovereignty, trade attorneys told CNBC.The targeted tariff threats Trump made over the weekend would likely rest on the same legal authority as the tariffs he imposed under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, or IEEPA, the attorneys said. The legality of that strategy will be decided by the Supreme Court, with a ruling expected as early as this week.\"Although the president hasn't specified if these tariffs would be IEEPA-based, the U.S. Supreme Court decision on IEEPA would likely affect the outcome of the threatened Greenland tariffs,\" said Michael Lowell, partner and chair of the Global Regulatory Enforcement Group at Reed Smith.\"Similar to the Brazil tariffs; if the Supreme Court rules IEEPA doesn't give the president tariff power, then these tariffs being threatened on NATO members would be illegal,\" Lowell said.Trump announced Saturday that if a deal is not reached allowing Washington to acquire Greenland, the eight European countries would face increasing tariffs, starting at 10% on Feb. 1 and rising to 25% on June 1. The court's latest batch of decisions issued Tuesday morning did not include the tariffs case.If the court overturns the tariffs, \"it may still be necessary for companies that import from those countries to bring suit to enforce,\" Lowell said. But \"that would be a quick lawsuit since the law would be clear by the ruling.\"watch nowTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Sunday said it's \"very unlikely\" that the Supreme Court will overturn Trump's use of emergency powers to impose tariffs. Even if the administration loses, Trump officials have said new tariffs will go into effect immediately.One of the other strategies the administration may turn to is Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962. Trade attorneys say the president could use the recently completed Section 232 investigation on critical minerals to levy tariffs. Greenland is a mineral-rich island that is a semi-autonomous territory of Denmark.In a Jan. 14 proclamation, Trump invoked Section 232 authority to direct the negotiation of agreements with foreign nations to \"ensure the United States has adequate critical mineral supplies and to mitigate the supply chain vulnerabilities as quickly as possible.\"If negotiations do not work, the proclamation says, \"it may be appropriate to impose import restrictions, such as tariffs, if satisfactory agreements are not reached in a timely manner.\"While recent Section 232 actions from Trump included the immediate imposition of tariffs on products, in the latest Section 232 policy on critical minerals the language says that the executive branch of the government reserves the right of the president to impose tariffs.\"Regardless of the IEEPA outcome, Section 232 remains a powerful and unaffected tool that the administration will likely continue to deploy for additional tariffs. Importantly, we note that these tariffs do not stack on top of IEEPA tariffs,\" TD Cowen analysts wrote in a recent note to clients. ",

The issue has ratcheted up trans-Atlantic tensions and rattled the NATO military alliance.\"I don't think they are going to push back too much,\" Trump told reporters in Florida on Monday evening, referring to EU opposition over Greenland. \"Look, we have to have it,\" he added.The U.S. president, who has long coveted making Greenland a part of the U.S., reiterated his interest in the sparsely populated territory following an audacious military intervention in Venezuela on Jan. 3.Trump has repeatedly said taking control of Greenland is vital for U.S. national security, frequently citing concerns about Russia and China's Arctic influence.The comments have raised alarm across Europe and prompted demonstrations in Copenhagen and Greenland's capital, Nuuk, over the weekend.  watch nowTrump sought to raise the stakes even further on Saturday when he announced a rising wave of tariffs on eight European countries if they oppose his bid to acquire Greenland. An extra levy of 10% will apply to the U.K., Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, the Netherlands, and Finland from Feb. 1, Trump said, before rising to 25% from June 1.European political leaders called the tariffs \"unacceptable\" and vowed to back Denmark, which is responsible for the island's foreign, defense, and security policies.The EU is also reportedly considering retaliatory measures against the Trump administration's fresh import levies, including a so-called trade \"bazooka\" and broader economic countermeasures. 'Arctic Endurance' exerciseDenmark has sought to beef up its military presence in Greenland, according to local media reports.  A \"substantial contribution\" of Danish combat troops were expected to arrive in Greenland's Kangerlussuaq on Monday evening, Danish broadcaster TV2 reported. Kangerlussuaq, in western Greenland, is home to the island's major international transport hub.Denmark's top military commander in the Arctic, Major General Søren Andersen, reportedly said that 100 Danish soldiers had already arrived in Nuuk and a similar number in Kangerlussuaq.

CNBC reported Monday, citing a person familiar with the matter, that Powell plans to be present for oral arguments in a case that challenges Trump's power to remove governor Lisa Cook. \"I actually think that's a mistake,\" Bessent told CNBC's Joe Kernen in an interview from the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. \"If you're trying not to politicize the Fed, for the Fed chair to be sitting there trying to put his thumb on the scale, that's a mistake.\"Trump said in August he was firing Cook from the Fed's board on mortgage fraud allegations. Cook, however, remains in her post at the central bank. Trump has also threatened to fire Powell on multiple occasions. Bessent's comments come after Powell issued a rare video statement, disclosing he was under criminal investigation. \"This new threat is not about my testimony last June or about the renovation of the Federal Reserve buildings. It is not about Congress's oversight role; the Fed through testimony and other public disclosures made every effort to keep Congress informed about the renovation project. Those are pretexts,\" Powell said in the Jan. 11 statement. ",

    "body": "Halfpoint Images | Moment | Getty ImagesStudent loan borrowers in default got a reprieve last week: The Trump administration said Friday it would postpone forced collections, for now. The pause is an about-face for the Department of Education, which had announced in late December that it would start seizing defaulted borrowers' paychecks as soon as early January. Over the summer, the department also walked back its plan to begin garnishing certain borrowers' Social Security payments. Around 9 million people are currently in default on their education debt, according to a recent estimate by Protect Borrowers, an advocacy organization.\"The delay will give borrowers a fighting chance at getting their loan into good standing, enrolling in a more affordable repayment plan and protecting their hard-earned wages from garnishment,\" said Michele Zampini, associate vice president of federal policy and advocacy at The Institute for College Access & Success. It's unclear how long collection activity will be paused. The Education Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Department officials, in their press release announcing the stay on garnishments, said the delay will allow them to implement recent changes to the student loan system included in President Donald Trump's \"big beautiful bill.\" That law offers borrowers additional ways to get out of default and overhauls repayment options.

More than 42 million Americans hold student loans, and the outstanding debt exceeds $1.6 trillion, according to the Congressional Research Service. Here's what defaulted student loan borrowers should do during the pause on collections, experts say.File your taxes 'immediately' Just last week, consumer advocates were warning that student loan borrowers could lose their tax refunds if they're behind on their payments. Borrowers may now be in the clear. To protect any possible tax refund, defaulted student loan borrowers ought to \"file their federal income tax returns immediately,\" said higher education expert Mark Kantrowitz. \"The IRS starts accepting federal income tax returns on Jan. 26,\" Kantrowitz said. \"If the return is filed electronically, they typically issue refunds within 21 days.\" Get current on your student loans ASAPGetting current on your student loans as soon as possible will also stop the government from seizing a part of your wages or Social Security benefits when collections resume. The Education Department can offset up to 15% of a student loan holder's after-tax income to put toward their debt. Social Security recipients can also typically see up to 15% of their monthly benefit reduced to pay back their defaulted student debt. Applying for a loan consolidation is usually the fastest way to get out of default, said Kyra Taylor, a staff attorney at the National Consumer Law Center. The process can be completed in as little as four weeks, Taylor said. But some defaulted borrowers may be required to make several on-time payments before they can consolidate, and not all borrowers will qualify, including some who've already consolidated their loans. Other things to consider: Consolidating your loans, which involves repackaging your federal student debts into a new federal student loan, can also lead you to lose progress on your forgiveness timeline under some repayment plans, Taylor said. Borrowers may also lose out on current repayment options if the consolidation wraps up after June, due to Trump's \"big beautiful bill.\"Another way to get out of default is through a loan rehabilitation. That process involves making \"nine voluntary, reasonable and affordable monthly payments,\" according to the Department of Education. Those nine payments can be made over \"a period of 10 consecutive months,\" it notes on the StudentAid.gov site.Your loan servicer may agree to end collection activity against you sooner if you start rehabilitation not long after receiving a notice of default or if you've already made five rehabilitation payments.Find an affordable repayment plan To avoid falling back into default, find a student loan repayment plan you can afford, consumer advocates say. You can submit a request for an income-driven repayment plan at StudentAid.gov. IDR plans cap your monthly payments at a share of your discretionary income and lead to debt forgiveness after a certain period, typically 20 years or 25 years.Most borrowers will be best off enrolling in the Income-Based Repayment plan, or IBR, Kantrowitz said. Trump's tax and spending package phases out the Income-Contingent Repayment plan, or ICR, and the Pay as You Earn plan, or PAYE, as of July 1, 2028.Starting July 1, 2026, student loan borrowers will have access to another IDR option, the Repayment Assistance Plan, or RAP. That plan leads to debt forgiveness after 30 years, compared with the typical timeline on other plans. But it will offer the lowest monthly bill for some borrowers due to its longer term.There are several tools available online to help you determine how much your monthly bill would be under different plans. Borrowers should be able to move between repayment plans at any time.Borrowers in especially difficult financial circumstances can look into options to pause their payments altogether, such as through the economic hardship deferment or unemployment deferment.

    "body": "Tomorrow's leaders might be today's artificial intelligence-obsessed kids, according to billionaire serial entrepreneur Mark Cuban.\"Students who use AI will produce better, more creative work and gain a collaborative relationship with technology that's needed in the future workplace,\" Cuban tells CNBC Make It, adding: \"Students who use AI will be best equipped to lead.\"The students who will use AI to find the most success, now and in the future, are those who use the technology to enhance their own critical-thinking skills, rather than replace them, Cuban said.\"Students using AI effectively know how to ask the right questions,\" because they have been given the opportunities to spend time getting comfortable using the technology, according to the billionaire. \"They use strong inputs and apply critical thinking to evaluate results. AI helps students think bigger, but it doesn't make decisions,\" he said.DON'T MISS: The ultimate guide to using AI to communicate betterEighty-eight percent of U.S. teachers believe that learning AI skills is important for their students' future success, according to Samsung's new Solve for Tomorrow 2025 AI Readiness Study, which surveyed 620 public middle and high school teachers across the country. However, 81% are concerned that an over-reliance on AI technology will erode students' critical-thinking skills, according to the same study, which is set to fully publish on Monday.\"Access is the biggest barrier\" to students being taught how to best use AI tools effectively and ethically at school, added Cuban. Along with fellow entrepreneur Emma Grede, Cuban is partnering with Samsung's STEM resources initiative, Solve for Tomorrow, which plans to distribute $2 million worth of technology and AI training resources to 500 U.S. schools in 2026, Samsung announced on Monday.Educators typically express concern that students will use AI tools to cheat, or that the information they get from AI chatbots and other models will include errors that spread misinformation. Those concerns are valid, research shows: AI assistants can make widespread mistakes, and the technology enables relatively low-effort creation and dissemination of fake images, audio and video.Yet some other experts agree with Cuban's assertion that students need to learn to use AI tools properly and productively to set themselves up for future success in the workplace. \"AI isn't always a crutch, it can also be a coach,\" psychologist and author Angela Duckworth said in a May 2025 commencement speech at the University of Pennsylvania's Graduate School of Education. \"In my view, [ChatGPT] has a hidden pedagogical superpower. It can teach by example.\"Cuban often likens the current AI boom to past technological revolutions, particularly the rise of computers and the internet, which helped spawn Cuban's own early entrepreneurial success. His frequent advice to students today: Spend as much time as possible familiarizing yourself with the latest AI tools and models, so you can impress future employers with your up-to-date prompt engineering and model customization skills.\"Every single company needs that. There is nothing intuitive for a company to integrate AI, and that's what people don't understand,\" Cuban said on an episode of the \"TBPN\" podcast that aired on Aug. 20, adding: \"That is going to be jobs left and right.\"Want to level up your AI skills? Sign up for Smarter by CNBC Make It's new online course, How To Use AI To Communicate Better At Work.

    "body": "Warren Buffett will no longer write the letters that accompany his firm, Berkshire Hathaway's annual reports, nor will he field questions at the company's annual shareholder meeting, he wrote in a letter published on Monday.\"As the British would say, I'm 'going quiet,'\" he wrote. \"Sort of.\"Even after Greg Abel takes the reins as Berkshire CEO at yearend, Buffett will continue to share a Thanksgiving message with shareholders — and anyone interested in reading.Interest will no doubt abound. Over his 95 years, Buffett has earned a reputation not only as a legendary investor, but as someone with the secrets to living a better life.In his most recent letter, Buffett took a second to look back and assure his fans that they still have time to do and get the things they want.\"I'm happy to say I feel better about the second half of my life than the first,\" he wrote. \"My advice: Don't beat yourself up over past mistakes — learn at least a little from them and move on. It is never too late to improve.\"Buffett's advice for living wellIn his letter, Buffett riffed on one his longstanding pieces of life advice: Consider your legacy, and work backward.Buffett recalled the story of Alfred Nobel, who reportedly read a mistakenly printed obituary and was horrified at what he saw. The move prompted him to \"change his behavior,\" Buffett wrote — Nobel, previously famous for, among other things, inventing dynamite, came to be associated with his eponymous prize.\"Don't count on a newsroom mix-up: Decide what you would like your obituary to say and live the life to deserve it,\" Buffet wrote.One route, Buffett said, is to imitate those people you most admire: \"Choose your heroes very carefully and then emulate them. You will never be perfect, but you can always be better,\" he wrote.Another way is to refocus your ambitions.\"Greatness does not come about through accumulating great amounts of money, great amounts of publicity or great power in government,\" Buffett wrote. \"When you help someone in any of thousands of ways, you help the world. Kindness is costless but also priceless.\"Regardless of your aims, Buffett wrote, you're unlikely to go wrong following the \"golden rule\" by treating other people, regardless of their station, the way you would want to be treated.\"Keep in mind that the cleaning lady is as much a human being as the Chairman,\" he wrote.Want to level up your AI skills? Sign up for Smarter by CNBC Make It's new online course, How To Use AI To Communicate Better At Work.

    "body": "Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) speaks to reporters outside the Senate Chamber of the U.S. Capitol Building on Oct. 1, 2025 in Washington, DC.Andrew Harnik | Getty ImagesDemocratic senators on Monday blamed the White House push to fast track artificial intelligence data centers and its attacks on renewable energy for rising electricity prices in certain parts of the U.S.Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and others demanded that the White House and Commerce Department detail what actions they have taken to shield consumers from the impact of massive data centers in a letter sent Monday.Voters are increasingly feeling the pinch of rising electricity prices. Democrats Mikie Sherrill and Abigail Spanberger campaigned on the issue in the New Jersey and Virgina governors' races, which they won in landslides last week.The senators took aim at the White House's relationship with companies like Meta, Alphabet, Oracle, and OpenAI, and the support the administration has shown for the companies' data center plans.The Trump administration \"has already failed to prevent those new data centers from driving up electricity prices from a surge of new commercial demand,\" the senators wrote. They accused the White House of making the problem worse by opposing the expansion of solar and wind power.The White House blamed the Biden administration and its renewable energy policies for driving up electricity prices in a statement.President Donald Trump \"declared an energy emergency to reverse four years of Biden's disastrous policies, accelerate large-scale grid infrastructure projects, and expedite the expansion of coal, natural gas, and nuclear power generation,\" White House spokeswoman Taylor Rogers said.The tech sector's AI plans have ballooned in size. OpenAI and Nvidia, for example, struck a deal in September to build 10 gigawatts of data centers to train and run AI applications. This is equivalent to New York City's peak baseline summer demand in 2024.The scale of these plans have raised questions about whether enough power is available to meet the demand and who will pay for the new generation that is needed. Renewable energy, particularly solar and energy storage, is the power source that can be deployed the quickest right now to meet demand.Retail electricity prices in the U.S. increased about 6% on average through August 2025 compared with the same period in 2024, according to the Energy Information Administration. Prices, however, can vary widely by region.Download the full letter here. ",

    "body": "Stephen Miran, governor of the US Federal Reserve, at the Nomura Research Forum during the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank Fall meetings in Washington, DC, US, on Wednesday, Oct. 15, 2025. Samuel Corum | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesFederal Reserve Governor Stephen Miran on Monday advocated for further interest rate cuts as a way stave off a potential economic softening ahead.In a CNBC interview, the central bank official held to his belief that the Fed should be moving at an even more rapid pace than its traditional quarter percentage point reductions.He advocated, as he has at the previous two Federal Open Market Committee meetings, for a 50 basis point, or half percentage point, reduction, though he said there at least should be a quarter-point easing.\"Nothing is certain. We could get data that would make me change my mind between now and then,\" Miran said. \"But failing new information that's made me update my forecasts, looking out in time, yeah, I would think that 50 is appropriate, as I have in the past, but at a minimum 25.\"Despite Miran's urging for bigger moves, the FOMC in both September and October opted for quarter-point cuts. Miran voted against both those moves but was not joined by any of his colleagues. Kansas City Fed President Jeffrey Schmid voted \"no\" in October, but only because he wanted to no cuts.Though there were only two votes against the October cut, public statements from multiple officials have indicated a wide dispersion of opinion among officials.Fed Chair Jerome Powell alluded to the disagreements at his most recent news conference, in which he indicated that another cut in December is not a foregone conclusion. Some policymakers have expressed hesitancy to but based on data showing inflation remains well above the Fed's 2% target, while others in favor of lowering rates fear further labor market deterioration.Miran said not continuing to ease would be short-sighted.\"If you're making data for what, if you're making policy for what the data are now, you are backward looking, because it will take 12 to 18 months for that to hit the economy. So you need to make policy now based on where you think the economy is going to be a year to a year and a half from now.\"Policymakers have been handcuffed by a lack of official economic data during the government lockdown. Miran said the data that is available has showed softening in both inflation and the labor market, which itself should make the Fed at least incrementally more dovish than its collective forecast in September indicating a total three cuts this year.Markets are pricing in about a 63% chance of a third reduction in December, though that has been falling gradually since the October Fed meeting, according to the CME Group's FedWatch.",

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., opposed the deal on the grounds that it failed to address his concerns about health care costs.If the deal passes in the Senate, it will be put to a vote in the House before being sent to the White House for Trump's signature.The House has been out of session since mid-September, when Republicans' temporary government funding measure passed nearly along party lines.House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., earlier Monday called for House members to begin traveling back to Washington, D.C., to vote on the Senate deal as soon as possible.",

    "body": "Paramount Global and Skydance logos are seen in this illustration taken December 17, 2024. Dado Ruvic | ReutersParamount Skydance said on Monday it expects $1 billion more in merger savings than it previously forecast as it outlines CEO David Ellison's ambitions for the company.The update came in Paramount's third-quarter earnings report — the company's first since its merger closed in early August. Ellison has been investing heavily in streaming and content, including live sports rights, and paying for it in part with cuts to other parts of the business.Paramount on Monday announced a new round of layoffs, affecting roughly 1,600 employees, tied to divestitures of assets in Argentina and Chile. Those cuts come weeks after Paramount began the process to lay off approximately 1,000 employees.At the same time, Paramount said it plans to increase prices for its flagship streaming service, Paramount+, in the first quarter of next year as it looks to beef up its content slate and improve its the technology of the platform.Paramount last raised its streaming prices in June 2024, after a previous hike in early 2023.Shares of the company were up about 6% in extended trading Monday.Cutting to growIn Monday's letter to shareholders, Ellison mapped out the combined company's initiatives, which he referred to as Paramount Skydance's \"North Star priorities.\" Those include investing in its growth businesses, growing its streaming business globally and identifying savings that would lead to \"long-term free cash flow generation.\"While Paramount Skydance management told investors in August they planned $2 billion in cost savings, that was upped to \"at least $3 billion in run-rate efficiencies\" as of Monday's report. More than $1.4 billion of those savings will be done by the end of the year and an additional $1 billion by the end of 2026, according to the letter.The company has been shedding staff. Less than a month after the merger was completed, the company alerted employees that it would be mandating a five-day work week beginning in January and would offer employees a buyout if they didn't want to make the transition. According to Monday's letter, about 600 employees chose to exit the company rather than return to an office full-time.The company also identified parts of its South American business to cut and said Monday it divested Television Federal, the operator of TV stations in Buenos Aires and other markets in Argentina. It's also in the process of exiting Chilevision in Chile, which is expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2026.These divestitures, which were deemed \"non-core\" to the company's future growth, according to the letter, would result in the 1,600 workforce reductions.Streaming, content in focusParamount Skydance CEO David Ellison speaks during the Bloomberg Screentime conference in Los Angeles on October 9, 2025. Patrick T. Fallon | Afp | Getty ImagesWhile Paramount Skydance's restructuring efforts, layoffs and cost savings have been a top priority for the company, Ellison has also wasted no time in making acquisitions to build up its content slate.Most notably, the company has reportedly been looking to acquire Warner Bros. Discovery in a deal that would see it gain the Warner Bros. film studio, the HBO Max streaming service, and a portfolio of cable TV networks including CNN and TNT Sports. Warner Bros. Discovery recently put itself up for sale, and has rebuffed three offers from Ellison in recent weeks, CNBC reported.Ellison wouldn't comment on his aspirations for WBD on Monday, but said the company was in build mode, which may or may not include mergers and acquisitions.\"I think it's important to know there's no must-haves for us,\" he said. \"We really look at this as buy versus build, and we absolutely have the ability to build to get to where we want to go.\" On the sports front, Paramount Skydance has added TKO Group's UFC to its slate in a 7-year, $7.7 billion deal. Paramount+ also became the exclusive long-term home for Zuffa Boxing, a new professional boxing promotion formed by TKO and the Saudi-backed Sela, in the U.S., Canada and Latin America.The company also inked a deal with Activision to develop content off of its Call of Duty video game franchise; signed a 5-year exclusive agreement with the creators of \"South Park;\" and brought on Matt and Ross Duffer, the creative team behind Netflix's hit \"Stranger Things,\" beginning in mid-2026.The additions to its content slate are geared at boosting Paramount+ streaming subscribers. Paramount Skydance President Jeff Shell said during a call with investors that the service had experienced notable customer losses over the summer, but they returned in the fall at the start of the NFL season.On Monday, the company said Paramount+ had more than 79 million global subscribers.

    "body": "Cooling towers at the Three Mile Island nuclear power plant in Middletown, Pennsylvania, Oct. 30, 2024.Danielle DeVries | CNBCNuclear power will receive most of the money from the Energy Department's loan office as the Trump administration pushes to quickly break ground on new reactors, Secretary Chris Wright said on Monday.\"We have significant lending authority at the loan program office,\" the Secretary of Energy said at a conference hosted by the American Nuclear Society in Washington D.C. \"By far the biggest use of those dollars will be for nuclear power plants — to get those first plants built.\"President Trump signed an executive order in May that called for the U.S. to break ground on 10 large nuclear reactors by 2030. Alphabet, Amazon, Meta Platforms and Microsoft are investing billions of dollars to restart old nuclear plants, upgrade existing ones, and deploy new reactor technology to meet the electricity demand from artificial intelligence data centers.Wright said he expects electricity demand from AI to attract billions of dollars in equity capital to build new nuclear capacity from \"very creditworthy providers.\" The Energy Department could match those private dollars by as much as four to one with low cost debt financing from the loan office, he said.\"When we leave office three years and three months from now, I want to see hopefully dozens of nuclear plants under construction,\" Wright said.Westinghouse dealThe Trump administration struck a deal last month with the owners of Westinghouse to invest $80 billion to build nuclear plants across the U.S. Westinghouse is owned by uranium miner Cameco and Brookfield Asset Management.Westinghouse has designed a modern reactor called the AP1000 that can power more than 750,000 homes. CEO Dan Sumner said in July that Westinghouse would meet Trump's call to build large new plants with the AP1000 design.Cameco Chief Operating Officer Grant Isaac said last week that the U.S. government has a number of options available to facilitate the financing of Westinghouse reactors, including the Energy Department's loan office.\"We're assured that there is a lot of interest in investing this minimum $80 billion in order to begin the process,\" Isaac told investors on Cameco's third-quarter earnings call.Under the terms of the October deal, Westinghouse could spin out as a separate, publicly-traded company with the U.S. government as a shareholder.But Westinghouse has struggled in the past to build the AP1000 on time and on budget. It went bankrupt in 2017 from cost overruns at big nuclear projects in Georgia and South Carolina.Two AP1000 reactors entered service at Plant Vogtle in Georgia in 2023 and 2024, years behind schedule and billions of dollars over budget. The South Carolina project was cancelled.",

David Ake | Getty ImagesThe Federal Aviation Administration on Monday will \"effectively prohibit business aviation\" at a dozen major U.S. airports, adding to flight restrictions for commercial airlines as air traffic controller shortages snarl travel in the government shutdown, a trade group said.Last week, the Trump administration ordered U.S. commercial airlines to cut their schedules to ease strains on air traffic controllers who are working without their regular paychecks in the shutdown. Government officials at first didn't curb private flights the same way they did for commercial aviation, though the air traffic controller staffing shortages have slowed travel broadly.The first commercial airline flight cuts of 4% went into affect on Friday and are set to rise to 10% of flights by this coming Friday.More than 4,500 commercial flights were canceled over the weekend and over 17,000 were delayed as staffing shortages worsened around the country, according to FlightAware. Aviation industry members applauded the Senate's progress toward ending the shutdown late Sunday, though a solution for the longest-ever such impasse hasn't been finalized.\"Safety is the cornerstone of business aviation, and NBAA is fully committed to ensuring the safety of the NAS,\" said National Business Aviation Association President and CEO Ed Bolen in a statement late Sunday. \"Among the ways we will do that is to ensure business aviation operators have an understanding of these restrictions and their implications.\"Most business jet operators don't use the busiest commercial airports, said the NBAA. The FAA didn't immediately comment.Here are the airports included in the new restrictions, according to the NBAA:Chicago O'Hare International Airport (ORD)Dallas Fort Worth International Airport (DFW)Denver International Airport (DEN)General Edward Lawrence Logan International Airport (BOS)George Bush Intercontinental Airport (IAH)Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport (ATL)John F.

    "body": "Flight timings and cancellations are displayed on the departures board, a month into the ongoing U.S. government shutdown, at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport in Arlington, Virginia, U.S., November 9, 2025. Annabelle Gordon | ReutersFlight cancellations were again piling up on Monday as air traffic controller shortages, worsened by the longest-ever U.S. government shutdown, snarled air travel coast to coast while President Donald Trump threatened to dock air traffic controllers' pay if they are absent from work.On Monday, 1,623 of the 25,735 scheduled U.S. flights were canceled, around 6.3% of the day's schedule, though on-time departures were better than average, a good sign after days of travel snarls, according to aviation data firm Cirium.Last week, the Trump administration ordered airlines to cut domestic flights at 40 major U.S. airports starting with 4% reductions last Friday and ramping up to 10% by this coming Friday, Nov. 14, citing strains on air traffic controllers.\"All Air Traffic Controllers must get back to work, NOW!!!,\" Trump said in a post on Truth Social, adding that he would recommend $10,000 bonuses for any air traffic controllers who didn't take any time off during the shutdown. He said those who don't immediately return to work would be \"docked.\"The National Air Traffic Controllers Association in response said that air traffic controllers are \"unsung heroes, who report for duty to safely guide this country's passengers and cargo to their destinations.\" The organization said they \"deserve our praise\" and \"have certainly earned it.\" Disruptions over the weekend included 18,576 delayed flights while 4,519 were canceled, according to FlightAware. Cancellations spilled over from regional, short-haul jets — which the largest U.S. airlines rely on for around half of domestic flights — to mainline flying.United Airlines and Delta Air Lines were each offering flight attendants extra pay to pick up flights, according to company messages seen by CNBC. United was also offering pilots extra pay for more flights than it usually does, an airline spokesman said. Such extra pay is common during storms or other disruptions.American Airlines Chief Operating Officer David Seymour said Monday that 250,000 of its customers were affected by disruptions over the weekend, with 1,400 cancellations attributed to air traffic control.\"This is simply unacceptable, and everyone deserves better. Our air traffic controllers deserve to be paid and our airline needs to be able to operate at a level of predictability and dependability that no major airline was able to provide the flying public this weekend,\" he said in a note to staff that was seen by CNBC.Airlines were waiving change fees and in some cases, fare differences, depending on when customers could rebook travel. Customers could also request a full refund for the portion of their tickets they were unable to fly.A sign of how severe air travel disruptions have become during the government shutdown: Sunday's 2,631 U.S. flight cancellations, 10% of the day's schedule, marked the fourth-worst day since January 2024, Cirium said.In comparison, on Friday morning, as Trump administration-mandated flight cuts took effect, cancellations ranked 72nd since the start of last year.Read more CNBC airline newsBoeing stems cash burn for first time since 2023 but takes $4.9 billion charge on 777X delaysAmerican Airlines is late to the luxury travel boom. Can it catch up?American Airlines hires industry veteran to lead commercial team as profits trail rivalsThe disruptions that upended the travel plans for hundreds of thousands of travelers forced them to look for alternative transportation. Car rental company Hertz last week reported an increase in one-way demand. There's also been increased demand for private jet flights in recent days, according to the CEO of charter and fractional ownership company Flexjet.Though the Trump administration order didn't initially require private aviation to cut in the same way as commercial airlines, the Federal Aviation Administration on Monday began limiting those flights at a dozen U.S. airports. However, many private jet operators don't use the busiest commercial airports, said the National Business Aviation Association.Increased strainAir traffic controllers missed their second paycheck of the shutdown on Monday, though they are still required to work. Some of them have taken second jobs to make ends meet, government and union officials have said.A commercial airliner takes off past the air traffic control tower at San Diego International Airport during the first day of a partial U.S. government shutdown in San Diego, California, U.S., Oct. 1, 2025.     Mike Blake | Reuters\"Now, they must focus on child care instead of traffic flows. Food for their families instead of runway separation,\" Nick Daniels, president of the National Air Traffic Controllers Association, said at a news conference on Monday. \"The added stress leads to fatigue, the fatigue has led to the erosion of safety and the increased risk every day that this shutdown drags on.\"The Senate made progress overnight on a deal that could end the shutdown, but it has not yet approved a funding bill.Daniels said it isn't yet clear how long it would take for controllers to receive back pay for their work. In the shutdown that ended in 2019, it took about 2½ months before the workers were made whole, he said.Trump's comments about air traffic controllers on Monday drew criticism from Rep. Rick Larsen, D-Wash., ranking member of the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, who called the statement \"nuts!\" and said it ran counter to Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy's call for aviation workers' support.\"The women and men working long hours in air traffic control towers to keep the aviation system running deserve our thanks and appreciation, not unhinged attacks on their patriotism,\" Larsen said.An end to the shutdown also doesn't mean that the flight restrictions will be lifted immediately. The FAA last week said it will determine whether to increase or decrease the flight restrictions based on safety data.While airlines had little time to make the last-minute schedule changes when the order came out last week, to ramp up flying again they will need time to adjust schedules, sell seats and position planes and crews.",

    "body": "US Speaker of the House Mike Johnson, Republican from Louisiana, speaks during a news conference on day 41 of the federal government shutdown, at the US Capitol on November 10, 2025, in Washington, DC. Saul Loeb | Afp | Getty ImagesThe Senate on Monday night began conducting a series of votes on a deal to end the government shutdown.The Senate's Republican leadership hopes to complete the votes by the end of the night.If approved, the deal will head the House of Representatives. If it passes in both chambers of Congress, it will head to President Donald Trump to be signed into law. Trump said earlier Monday that he approves the deal as it currently stands.House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., added uncertainty to the fate of the deal when he refused to commit to a key guarantee in the deal, of assuring Democrats that Congress will hold a separate vote in December on potentially extending enhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies.\"I'm not committing to it or not committing to it,\" Johnson said on CNN.Johnson on Monday called for House members to begin traveling to Washington, D.C., so that they can vote as soon as possible on a Senate deal that would end the longest U.S. government shutdown in history.Johnson spoke to reporters a day after the Senate narrowly approved the first stage of the deal to reopen the government, which shut down on Oct. 1.Johnson indicated to reporters that he expected votes in the House to occur this week, but he did not state a specific day. He later told the Republican House conference during a call that he would like the vote to occur on Wednesday, although that is contingent on the Senate voting for it completely by then, according to a person familiar with the situation.The speaker said he would issue an official 36-hour notice before the House votes.Johnson said, \"There'll be long days and long nights here for the foreseeable future to make up for all this lost time that was imposed upon us.\"Johnson has kept the House out of session since it passed a continuing resolution in September to fund the government through mid-November.Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R.-S.D., speaking on the Senate flood Monday morning, urged his colleagues to vote as soon as Monday to send the deal to the House.\"Let's not pointlessly drag this bill out,\" Thune said. \"Let's get it done. Get it over to the House so that we can get this government open.\"\"I am grateful that the end is in sight, but I would encourage every member of this body, Democrat or Republican, pro-bill or anti-bill, not to stand in the way of being able to deliver the coming relief quickly,\" Thune said.\"The American people have suffered for long enough.\"Any one senator can delay voting on the bill for days with procedural hurdles. But a vote can be held quickly if the entire Senate agrees that it should happen.The Senate deal, forged over the weekend, drew support from seven Democrats and one independent who caucuses with Democrats, which, combined with 52 Republican senators' votes, was enough to reach a 60-vote threshold to pass.The deal does not include what had been the key demand for Democrats: an extension of enhanced Affordable Care Act tax credits, which are due to expire at the end of December.But the agreement, for the first time since the shutdown began, includes a guarantee by Republicans of a vote in December on a bill chosen by Democrats to extend those subsidies, which more than 20 million Americans use to reduce the cost of health insurance plans purchased on ACA marketplaces.Read more CNBC government shutdown coverageDuffy warns air travel will be ‘reduced to a trickle’ as the shutdown drags onTrump tells Republicans to send health insurance money 'directly to the people'Food banks in ‘disaster response mode’ due to shutdown, SNAP cuts, leaders saySenate Republicans reject Democrat deal to reopen governmentDemocratic leader offers deal to reopen government but Republicans sneerTrump admin asks Supreme Court to block order it pay full SNAP benefitsSNAP benefits must be fully paid by Trump administration by Friday, judge ordersDC sandwich thrower Sean Dunn found not guilty of assaulting federal agentJudge dismisses criminal case against Boeing over Max crashes despite skepticismNancy Pelosi announces retirement from CongressTrump bashes Mamdani after Democrats sweep key electionsSupreme Court justices appear skeptical that Trump tariffs are legalCalifornia voters approve new U.S. House map to boost Democrats in 2026Democrats win big on election night in key racesThe Senate deal would fund the government through the end of January; reverse all shutdown-related layoffs of federal employees; and guarantee that all federal workers will be paid their normal salaries during the shutdown.The deal also includes provisions for a bipartisan budget process and prevents the White House from using continuing resolutions to fund the government. CRs have been repeatedly used to avoid government shutdown, but are controversial because they frequently avoid lawmakers having to make decisions about long-term funding of the government that a normal budget would resolve.The deal would also fund, through September, the SNAP program, which helps feed 42 million Americans through food stamps.Under a federal law passed in 2019, government employees who are furloughed during a shutdown must be paid for the time they were out of work at their standard rate of pay \"at the earliest date possible, regardless of scheduled pay dates.\"— CNBC's Emily Wilkins contributed to this story.",

    "body": "Ofer Shacham is CEO of Majestic Labs.Tal GivonyThree former Meta and Google silicon executives on Monday announced they've raised a total of $100 million to build technology they say will reduce cloud companies' spend on data center buildouts.Called Majestic Labs, the startup's co-founders are Ofer Shacham, Sha Rabii and Masumi Reynders, all of whom spent years working together leading silicon products at Meta and Google. Majestic's patent-pending silicon design architecture includes 1,000 times the memory of a typical enterprise-grade server, the co-founders told CNBC.Majestic develops its entire chip system, much like Nvidia, but each of the startup's servers may replace up to 10 of today's leading racks, they said.The company closed its $71 million Series A funding round in September, led by Bow Wave Capital. Among its others investors is Lux Capital. Prior to Monday's announcement, the co-founders had been quietly working on the startup since late 2023.Majestic's funding announcement comes as major tech companies raise their capital expenditures, primarily for data center infrastructure. Alphabet, Meta, Microsoft and Amazon each lifted their guidance for capital expenditures in October, and they collectively expect that number to reach more than $380 billion this year.While the majority of large language models and AI workloads have relied on Nvidia's graphics processing units, or GPUs, more companies are entering the fold. Google last week announced Ironwood, its latest tensor processing unit, or TPUs, which artificial intelligence startup Anthropic plans to use for its Claude model.Sha Rabii is Majestic Labs President. Rabii used to lead Google's silicon efforts.GoogleHowever, memory capacity remains a challenge for companies that have large amounts of data to process, which the Majestic co-founders said they hope to address.\"Nvidia makes excellent GPUs and has driven incredible AI innovation,\" Shacham, Majestic's CEO, told CNBC. \"We're not trying to replace GPUs across the board — we're solving for memory-intensive AI workloads where the fixed compute-to-memory ratio becomes a constraint\"Majestic is going after hyperscalers and large companies that run AI models, including those from the financial and pharmaceutical industries, the co-founders said.The technology underpinning the company includes patent-pending architectures that allow Majestic to collapse multiple racks worth of conventional equipment and memory into a single server. Majestic claims that will allow for a smaller footprint and requires less power and cooling, helping the company's clients reduce their data center costs.Prototypes of Majestic's box servers will be available for some customers in 2027, and the startup has already begun discussing pre-orders, the co-founders said. Majestic declined to share its clients.The company has fewer than 50 employees — half of which are based in Tel Aviv, Israel, while the rest are based in Los Altos, California. Majestic said it plans to grow each location and seek additional funding in the coming year. Always in the peripheryThe trio met at Google, and together, they helped stand up the team working on Google's TPUs.\"We'd been building AI for DARPA, for Google, for Meta, but suddenly AI became this ubiquitous thing that everybody needs,\" Shacham said. \"Every large company needs AI, and that was a good time for me to say 'How about we go and do that?'\"The first to join the search company was Reynders in 2003, who went to Google as a senior corporate counsel. She's now Majestic's COO and manages the business side of the company.At Google, her teams were focused on business development and product strategy focused on silicon. Reynders spent 15 years at Google, where she rose to director of product management and silicon.Rabii, Majestic's president, earned his doctorate from Stanford University, and in 2011, he sold his last chip design company, Arda Technologies, to Google, where he rose to senior director of engineering. Under Rabii, Google launched its video chip Argos, which is used in YouTube's data centers.Shacham sold his company, Chip Genesis, to Google in August 2013, when Rabii was leading Google's silicon team. Chip Genesis's technology was used broadly across many products including the AI accelerators in Google's Pixel smartphones. At Google, Shacham rose to head of silicon design and implementation for consumer hardware.Majestic Labs chief operating officer and co-founder Masumi ReyndersSharyce RainsThe three of them left Google in 2018 for the company then known as Facebook. There, they built the Facebook Agile Silicon Team, known as \"FAST,\" within the company's Reality Labs hardware division. Shacham rose to vice president and head of FAST.When Meta laid off employees from Reality Labs in 2023, Shacham had to conduct the cuts, he said. At that point, Meta was trying to conserve cash, he said.\"Part of that was layoffs across the organization, and FAST was not excluded from that,\" Shacham said. \"It's not a good place to be, not a good feeling to do.\"The three founded Majestic Labs after brainstorming about the biggest bottleneck problems for silicon and AI.\"We've been friends and colleagues for a long time, so this notion of working together and doing something exciting has always been in the periphery,\" Reynders said.As Majestic eyes growth and hiring in 2026, the co-founders said they're tapping into their collective of rolodex of the more than 1,500 employees they've worked with at prior companies, including Meta and Google.\"There's that trust they already have with us,\" Rabii said of the former colleagues.WATCH: Google opens access to its most powerful AI chipwatch now",

    "body": "Warren Buffett laid out a plan to \"step up\" the pace of giving away his $149 billion estate to his children's foundations, while still allowing for a short period that lets Berkshire Hathaway shareholders gain confidence in incoming CEO Greg Abel.Buffett, in a Thanksgiving letter that will become an annual tradition, said he needs to accelerate the disbursement of his Berkshire stock to his three children's foundations because of their own advanced ages and that by doing so it will \"improve the probability that they will dispose of what will essentially be my entire estate before alternate trustees replace them.\"Abel, 63, is set to take over for Buffett, 95, as Berkshire CEO at the start of the new year with the \"Oracle of Omaha\" remaining chairman.\"I would like to keep a significant amount of 'A' shares until Berkshire shareholders develop the comfort with Greg that Charlie and I long enjoyed,\" wrote Buffett, referring to longtime Berkshire vice chairman and his cherished business partner, Charlie Munger, who died two years ago.  \"That level of confidence shouldn't take long. My children are already 100% behind Greg as are the Berkshire directors,\" said Buffett.Buffett owns about $149 billion worth of Berkshire based on shares held at the end of the second quarter, making him far and away the largest shareholder. Most of his wealth is in the original A shares which trade for around $751,480 a share.He said 1,800 of those Berkshire A shares were converted into 2.7 million B shares and given Monday to four family foundations: The Susan Thompson Buffett Foundation, The Sherwood Foundation, The Howard G. Buffett Foundation and the NoVo Foundation. This donation is worth more than $1.3 billion.\"The acceleration of my lifetime gifts to my children's foundations in no way reflects any change in my views about Berkshire's prospects,\" added Buffett.The note marks Buffett's first major communication since announcing plans to step down as CEO, signaling the close of a six-decade run that made him a household name and one of the most successful investors in history.\"As the British would say, I'm 'going quiet.'... sort of,\" Buffett wrote in the letter.'I Generally Feel Good'Abel, currently vice chairman of noninsurance operations, will take over writing Berkshire's annual shareholder letters — a tradition that Buffett began in 1965 and that has become essential reading across Wall Street — while Buffett said he will continue this Thanksgiving message.In one of the most personal passages of the letter, Buffett gave a rare update on his health.\"To my surprise, I generally feel good. Though I move slowly and read with increasing difficulty, I am at the office five days a week where I work with wonderful people,\" he wrote. \"I was late in becoming old ... but once it appears, it is not to be denied.\"The Berkshire FortressSince taking control of Berkshire in 1965, Buffett has transformed a struggling textile mill into a $1 trillion conglomerate spanning insurance, railroads, utilities and consumer brands.He devoted part of his letter to reaffirming Berkshire's durability, saying it is designed to withstand nearly any economic environment.\"Berkshire has less chance of a devastating disaster than any business I know,\" he said.Berkshire held a record $381.6 billion in cash at the end of September, underscoring its unmatched balance sheet and cautious investing approach. It has also been selling equities for 12 straight quarters, reflecting Buffett's caution in a richly valued market.The company's underlying businesses remain strong with operating profit jumping 34% in the third quarter. Still, Buffett acknowledged that Berkshire's sheer scale has become both its strength and its limitation.\"In aggregate, Berkshire's businesses have moderately better-than-average prospects, led by a few non-correlated and sizable gems. However, a decade or two from now, there will be many companies that have done better than Berkshire; our size takes its toll,\" he wrote.Berkshire's stock has risen roughly 10% in 2025, outpacing many defensive names but lagging the S&P 500 amid a tech-driven rally.\"Our stock price will move capriciously, occasionally falling 50% or so as has happened three times in 60 years under present management,\" Buffett said. \"Don't despair; America will come back and so will Berkshire shares.\"— With reporting by Becky Quick.",

    "body": "watch nowAfter President Donald Trump's recent meeting with Chinese leader Xi Jinping, there is hope for U.S. farmers that the soybean business may be on the way back.At the China International Import Expo last week, Illinois soybean farmer Scott Gaffner said he came to Shanghai to save his China business.\"We want to make sure that our soybeans are getting exported to China because it's a very important market to us,\" Gaffner, who is a member of the U.S. Soybean Export Council, told CNBC.He said the Gaffner Family Farm typically sells 40% of its annual soybean exports to China, but as he arrived in Shanghai, that number this year was zero.As part of the trade arrangement discussed between Trump and Xi in the South Korean port city of Busan at the end of October, China lifted retaliatory tariffs on some agricultural products. But it has maintained a 13% tariff on U.S. soybeans.The White House said China will buy 12 million metric tons of soybeans by the end of this year and 25 million for each of the next three years.That's still down from the nearly 27 million metric tons China bought in 2024. The country has yet to confirm the Trump administration's numbers.Read more CNBC politics coverageDemocrats win big on Election Night in key racesZohran Mamdani wins New York City mayor's race, NBC News projectsDemocratic candidate Mikie Sherrill wins New Jersey governor's race, NBC News projectsDemocrats win Virginia governor, attorney general races, NBC News projectsSNAP update: Trump admin will pay 50% of food stamp benefits in November amid shutdownTrump says he has 'no idea who' Binance's CZ is after pardoning himTrump backtracks on attending Supreme Court tariffs case arguments\"We'd like to have just kind of a continuation of smooth sailing,\" said Jim Sutter, CEO of the U.S. Soybean Export Council, at his group's booth at the expo. \"Do I think that's realistic? I don't know. These are two big, powerful countries, a lot of issues.\"Eric Zheng, president of the American Chamber of Commerce (AmCham) in Shanghai, told CNBC last week that the U.S. and China have stabilized the relationship for now, but \"structural differences remain.\"Uncertainty is typical of the relationship between the two economic powers, but the negotiation around soybean purchases this time around is playing out more urgently than Trump's first term, as China has been diversifying away from U.S. supply.Even before the trade war, the Chinese were buying more from other countries like Brazil and Argentina, and as tensions built, Beijing specifically stopped purchasing U.S. soybeans to pressure Trump.The move caused major financial problems for American farmers like Gaffner.\"Normally, whenever we are combining the soybeans, we're going take them right to the river, down the river to Louisiana and then ship out to China,\" Gaffner said. \"But with China not buying any soybeans, we're taking them right to our bins, and we're storing them in our bins.\"Gaffner is still optimistic.Towards the end of his trip, he got a call that his farm had sold one shipment of soybeans.\"We like no trade war, because hopefully that levels the playing field,\" he said. \"We just want to do business.\"watch now",

    "body": "Michael Intrator, co-founder and CEO of CoreWeave, speaks at the Semafor World Economy Summit during the International Monetary Fund and World Bank Spring meetings in Washington on April 25, 2025.Kent Nishimura | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesCoreWeave, a provider of infrastructure for artificial intelligence companies, reported better-than-expected third-quarter revenue on Monday, but the company delivered disappointing full-year guidance. The stock dropped 6% in extended trading. Here's how the company did in comparison with LSEG consensus:Earnings: Loss of 22 cents per shareRevenue: $1.36 billion vs. $1.29 billion expectedRevenue in the quarter soared 134% from $583.9 million a year ago, according to a statement. The company reported a net loss of $110 million, narrowing from about $360 million in the same quarter last year.CoreWeave's growth is tied directly to the AI boom, as the company rents out Nvidia graphics processing units and has won business from leading cloud infrastructure providers, including Google and Microsoft. The company's backlog now stands at $55.6 billion, with 2.9 gigawatts in contracted power, up from 2.2 gigawatts on June 30, according to the statement.However, CoreWeave now sees 2025 revenue coming in between $5.05 billion and $5.15 billion, trailing the average analyst estimate of $5.29 billion, according to LSEG.  A third-party data center developer is behind schedule, CEO Mike Intrator said on the company's earnings call. But he added that the delay won't affect CoreWeave's backlog.\"There was a problem at one data center that's impacting us, but there are 32 data centers in our portfolio,\" Intrator said.During the quarter, CoreWeave announced a $6.5 billion expansion of its business with OpenAI and a six-year deal with Meta worth up to $14.2 billion. CoreWeave also received its sixth contract from \"a leading hyperscaler.\"The company remains supply-constrained, Intrator said. The shortage is not in power but instead has to do with the availability of partly completed \"powered-shell\" data centers in which CoreWeave can set up its own equipment, he said.Meanwhile, CoreWeave is building its own data center infrastructure from the ground up in Pennsylvania, he said.\"The overwhelming majority of the delay that you're seeing should be taken care of within Q1 of next year.\" Intrator said. CoreWeave went public on the Nasdaq in March, selling shares at $40 each. On Monday the stock closed at $105.61, representing a 164% return. The Nasdaq has gained 32% over a similar period. CoreWeave shares slipped in extended trading on Monday.Less than four months after its IPO, CoreWeave announced its intent to acquire data center infrastructure operator Core Scientific for $9 billion, but Core Scientific shareholders voted against the proposed deal.CoreWeave's 2026 capital expenditures should be \"well in excess of double\" the total for 2025, which will end up between $12 billion and $14 billion, said Nitin Agrawal, the company's finance chief.WATCH: Cramer's Mad Dash: CoreWeavewatch now",

    "body": "Even with a lower-than-expected inflation reading Thursday, the cost of everyday goods and services remains much higher than it was at the start of the decade.Prices rose 2.7% over the past year, according to the consumer price index, which tracks changes in the cost of everyday items such as groceries, shelter, clothing, health care and transportation. While that marks a sharper-than-expected slowdown from October's 3% pace and brings inflation closer to the Federal Reserve's 2% target, it has remained above the Fed's goal since March 2021.The cumulative effect of those increases continues to strain household budgets, says Scott Anderson, chief U.S. economist at BMO Harris Bank.\"We're all comparing our grocery bills to what our money could buy in 2019 and not walking away with a warm and fuzzy feeling,\" Anderson tells CNBC Make It.Overall prices are up about 25% since January 2020, based on CPI data — more than double the roughly 10% cumulative inflation seen in the five years before that.Feeling the pinchWages have largely kept up with inflation since 2020 by most federal measures of income, according to a July 2025 report from Brookings. Still, not every worker has seen those gains, says Anderson.\"Wage gains tend to be higher for higher-skilled workers than lower-skilled workers, and in industries like financial services, information services and manufacturing sectors,\" he says.That uneven pattern may help explain why confidence remains weak, even with relatively low unemployment and steady overall wage growth.Consumer sentiment — a closely watched measure of household confidence — is near historic lows, based on a monthly University of Michigan survey. The survey asks households how their finances compare with a year ago, whether they expect their finances to improve in the year ahead and whether now is a good time to make major purchases. The latest index reading fell to 51 in November, a level last seen during the inflation surge of 2022, when the year-over-year inflation rate reached a peak of 9.1%.Similarly, a recent Bankrate survey found that 32% of Americans expect their finances to worsen in 2026, the highest level of pessimism since the annual survey began in 2018. Inflation stood out as the top concern, cited by nearly two-thirds of respondents — far more often than income, debt or interest rates.\"The cost of living still feels like it's rising for households who are now paying a lot more for food, electricity and housing than they were for several years before inflation shot up,\" says Atsi Sheth, chief credit officer at Moody's Ratings.Want to give your kids the ultimate advantage?

    "body": "Signage at an ICICI Prudential Asset Management Co. branch in Delhi, India, on Thursday, Dec. 18, 2025. ICICI Prudential AMC's initial public offering to raise as much as 106 billion rupees ($1.2 billion) received bids for more than 1.37 billion shares, compared with 35.02 million offered, at close on last day of the sale Tuesday, according to exchange data. Photographer: Anindito Mukherjee/Bloomberg via Getty ImagesBloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesShares of ICICI Prudential, one of India's largest asset management companies, rose 20% in their trading debut Friday, following a 106 billion rupees ($1.17 billion) initial public offering.The IPO by the firm, jointly owned by India's ICICI Bank and UK's Prudential, was priced at 2,165 rupees per share at the upper end of the price band. Shares, which were listed on the National Stock Exchange as well as the BSE, were last trading at 2,593 rupees.The issue was subscribed more than 39 times during the bidding process, driven primarily by a strong demand from institutional investors. Retail portion of the IPO was subscribed just 2.5 times.Singapore's GIC and Temasek and India's public sector insurance company Life Insurance Corporation were among the major institutional investors that participated in the IPO.ICICI Prudential AMC is India's largest asset management company in India in terms of assets managed under active mutual fund schemes with an mutual fund quarterly average assets of 101.47 billion rupees. The company had 15.5 million retail investors as of end of September. Citigroup Global Markets India, BofA Securities India, Morgan Stanley, Axis Capital, Avendus Capital and ICICI Securities were among the joint bookrunners.Though this IPO saw relatively tepid individual investor interest, global consultancy firm Bain & Company estimates retail investor-driven assets of Indian mutual fund industry to grow to about $3.3 trillio by 2035 from 45 trillion rupees in fiscal year 2025. This comes as salaried millennials in metro cities and Gen Zs increasingly invest savings in mutual funds, even avoiding direct equities, the report said.As more retail investors participate in capital markets, the opportunities for asset managers to handle those funds are ballooning. Investment through systematic investment plans, which refer to investing bite-sized sums at regular intervals, tripled to 2.89 trillion rupees in fiscal year 2025 from 2021, data from Association of Mutual Funds in India shows.India has seen companies raise $11.4 billion via 252 IPOs during the first three quarters of this year, according to an EY report in October. With many big-ticket listings — LG Electronics, Tata Capital and Lenskart as well as ICICI Prudential AMC — coming in the final quarter, the final amount of funds raised is expected to be higher than last year's $19.9 billion.\"Due to financialization of savings Indians are increasing their exposure to mutual funds and equities. AMCs like ICICI Prudential are a carrier of this change,\" said Kranthi Bathini, equity strategist at Mumbai-based WealthMills Securities.He added that the stock is \"fairly valued, but any dips is a buy opportunity\" as ICICI Prudential AMC with its scale of operations is a good play on the long-term story of financialization of savings in India.ICICI Prudential AMC's revenue rose over 32% in fiscal year 2025 to 49.77 billion rupees, year on  year, while its net income climbed nearly 30% to 26.50 billion rupees.",

    "body": "People shop for groceries at a store in Port Washington, New York, U.S., Nov. 19, 2025. Shannon Stapleton | ReutersConsumer prices rose less than expected in November, giving investors hope that inflationary pressures may be cooling enough for U.S. monetary policy to be eased more than Wall Street anticipates. The consumer price index rose at a 2.7% annualized rate last month, a delayed report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics showed. Economists polled by Dow Jones expected the CPI to have risen 3.1%. The core CPI, which strips out volatile food and energy prices, was also cooler than anticipated, increasing 2.6% over 12 months. It was expected to have risen by 3%. The monthly increases also were less than expected, with both the all-items and core CPI gains at 0.2%, compared to estimates of 0.3%.This is the first report that encompasses the period during which the U.S. government was shut down. The stoppage disrupted the data collection process in that time. It also led to the cancellation of the October CPI release. This data was originally expected to be released Dec. 10.Because the October CPI was canceled, Thursday's report did not have all the usual data points of a typical CPI release. The BLS said it was unable to retroactively collect the October data, but did use some \"nonsurvey data sources\" to make the index calculations. On a 12-month basis, food prices rose 2.6% and energy was up 4.2%. Shelter costs, which make up about one-third of the weighting in the index, rose 3%, indicating progress towards the Fed's 2% overall inflation goal. Shelter had been a major contributors towards elevated inflation readings.Economists may be hesitant to read too much into this report as the start of a downward trend in inflation because of the lack of October comparison data in the release.Still, investors parsed through the report as they look for clues on future monetary policy moves from the Federal Reserve. The Fed earlier this month cut its benchmark overnight rate by 25 basis points for the third time in a row. \"A tame CPI will reinforce the Fed is focused on protecting the employment market. And that means a Fed 'put' is now in place for the economy,\" Tom Lee, head of research at Fundstrat, said in a note ahead of Thursday's release. \"In other words, if the Fed is concerned about downside risks to the economy, the Fed 'put' comes into play and this would be for stocks to rise.\"Odds for a January rate cut remained low, but traders began pricing in a higher chance of a March reduction. The CME Group's FedWatch tool showed a 58.3% probability of a rate cut for the month, up from around 53.9% on Wednesday. Stock futures jumped following the release. S&P 500 futures were up about 0.5% as of 8:39 a.m. ET. A gain would snap a four-day losing streak for the benchmark index. Treasury yields slipped, with the 10-year note yield last trading around 4.11%.— CNBC's Sean Conlon contributed reporting.",

    "body": "President Donald Trump speaks during the unveiling of the Kennedy Center Honors nominees at the Kennedy Center in Washington, Aug. 13, 2025.Mandel Ngan | Afp | Getty ImagesThe John F. Kennedy Memorial Center for the Performing Arts, commonly known as the Kennedy Center, will be renamed the \"Trump-Kennedy Center,\" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Thursday.The prestigious Washington cultural center's board of trustees, who were appointed by President Donald Trump in February, \"have just voted unanimously\" on the name change, Leavitt said in an X post.They did so \"because of the unbelievable work President Trump has done over the last year in saving the building,\" Leavitt said.\"Congratulations to President Donald J. Trump, and likewise, congratulations to President Kennedy, because this will be a truly great team long into the future! The building will no doubt attain new levels of success and grandeur,\" she said.The move may face challenges, however: U.S. code states that no new \"memorials or plaques in the nature of memorials shall be designated or installed in the public areas of the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts.\"To change that would require Congress, NBC News reported in July. House Republicans have already introduced at least one bill to rename the center in Trump's honor.\"The Kennedy Center is a living memorial to a fallen president and named for President Kennedy by federal law,\" said former Democratic Rep. Joe Kennedy III, a grandnephew of former President Kennedy, on X. \"It can no sooner be renamed than can someone rename the Lincoln Memorial, no matter what anyone says,\" he wrote.Leavitt's depiction of a center that has been saved \"not only from the standpoint of its reconstruction, but also financially, and its reputation\" contrasts with reporting from multiple news outlets that ticket sales and staffing both have sharply declined this year.The New York Times reported last month that internal figures showed ticket sales during a typical week in October down by about 50% from the same period a year earlier.The Washington Post, which analyzed sales data from early September through Oct. 19, found an \"across-the-board drop-off\" in ticket sales for the center's three largest performance spaces.Weeks after taking office, Trump named himself chairman of the Kennedy Center and terminated a slew of existing board members, saying they \"do not share our Vision for a Golden Age in Arts and Culture.\"He signaled in October that the name change was forthcoming.In a Truth Social post, Trump shared pictures of a newly painted colonnade on the outside of the building below a caption praising \"the new TRUMP KENNEDY, whoops, I mean, KENNEDY CENTER, columns.\"He nevertheless said later Thursday that he was \"surprised\" by the board's decision.\"I was honored by it. You know, we're saving the building,\" he told reporters in the Oval Office.The center was not initially named after Kennedy.It was created in 1958, when President Dwight Eisenhower signed legislation to \"provide for a National Cultural Center\" in Washington.In 1962, Eisenhower's successor, Kennedy, and first lady Jacqueline Kennedy led a $30 million fundraising campaign to build the center.Kennedy was assassinated in November 1963. Two months later, President Lyndon Johnson signed a law renaming the center in honor of the slain president.Trump has used the Kennedy Center extensively during the first year of his second presidential term.He attended a board meeting there in March, claiming the building was in \"tremendous disrepair.\" In June, he and first lady Melania Trump appeared for the opening night of the musical \"Les Miserables.\"This month, Trump took the unusual step of hosting the Kennedy Center Honors, where actors Sylvester Stallone and Michael Crawford, and musicians including Gloria Gaynor, George Strait and the members of '80s rock band Kiss, were saluted.Trump also attended the FIFA World Cup drawing at the center, where he was awarded the soccer organization's newly created \"peace prize.\"",

    "body": "Kazuo Ueda, governor of the Bank of Japan (BOJ), during a committee on financial affairs meeting at the lower house of parliament in Tokyo, Japan, on Friday, Nov. 21, 2025.Bloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesJapan's central bank on Friday raised its short-term rates to a three-decade high, driving a sell-off in government bonds, while signaling its readiness to tighten further as it marches ahead with policy normalization.     The Bank of Japan raised benchmark rates by 25 basis points to 0.75%, their highest level since 1995, and in line with expectations of economists polled by Reuters. The BOJ said that real interest rates are expected to remain \"significantly negative,\" adding that accommodative financial conditions will continue to firmly support economic activity. Following the decision, the yield on 10-year Japanese government bonds rose about 5 basis points to 2.019%, while the 20-year JGB yield climbed 3 basis points to 2.975%, both reaching their highest since 1999. The yen weakened 0.25% to 155.92 against the dollar, and the benchmark Nikkei 225 stock index gained 1.28%.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconJapan embarked on policy normalization last year, abandoning the world's only negative interest rate regime that had been in place since 2016. Since then, the BOJ has consistently maintained its stance on gradually lifting rates, stating that its goal was to see a \"virtuous cycle\" of rising wages and prices.Inflation has run above above the BOJ's 2% target for 44 straight months, with  data released earlier in the day showing consumer price growth at 2.9% in November. High inflation has pressured real wages that have been declining for 10 months in a row, according to labor ministry data. The BOJ projected that core inflation — which strips out the prices of fresh food —  is likely to decelerate below 2% from April to September 2026, due to a slower rise in food prices as well as the effects of government measures aimed at addressing rising prices.Higher rates risk exacerbating the downturn in the Japanese economy. Revised GDP numbers for the third quarter showed that economy shrank more than initially estimated, contracting 0.6% quarter on quarter, and 2.3% on an annualized basis.   The BOJ said in its statement that while weakness has been seen in the economy, corporate profits were likely to remain high, and firms are expected to continue raising wages in 2026.\"It is highly likely that the mechanism in which both wages and prices rise moderately will be maintained,\" the bank said, adding that the possibility of underlying inflation reaching its 2% target was rising. The rate hike also comes at a time when JGB yields have been hitting multi-decade highs, spiking further after the decision, raising the risk of higher borrowing costs for Japan and increasing fiscal strain. Asia's second-largest economy already boasts of the world's highest debt-to-GDP ratio, standing at almost 230%, according to data from the International Monetary Fund.Rising yields could, however, support the Japanese currency. The yen has been trading around 154-157 against the dollar since November, having weakened over 2.5% since Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi, a proponent of looser monetary policy, took office in October.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconAfter this hike, the BOJ is likely to raise its policy rate in mid-2026, taking it to a terminal rate of 1%, Shigeto Nagai, head of Japan Economics at Oxford Economics, said in a statement to CNBC before the BOJ decision. Terminal or neutral rate refers to one that balances inflation and economic growth — it neither overheats, nor slows down the economy. At a press conference following the rate decision, BOJ Governor Kazuo Ueda said that \"We will seek to produce new estimates on Japan's neutral rate, if needed, though I don't think that will help us narrow the range that much,\" according to Reuters.Ueda reportedly said earlier this month that it was difficult to estimate the terminal rate, with the central bank pegging it at 1% to 2.5%.\"Looking ahead, the BOJ is likely to continue hiking rates gradually without explicitly indicating where it sees the terminal rate, Hirofumi Suzuki, chief FX strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation, said in a note after the press conference.Suzuki added that a rapid tightening was not expected, and downward pressure on the yen will continue. Oxford's Nagai warned that another rate hike by the BOJ could cause friction with Takaichi, if inflation declines smoothly towards 2% in the first half of 2026. Takaichi during her leadership contest had staunchly opposed rate hikes by the BOJ, but has since softened her stance.Nagai said that the reason why Takaichi would accept this rate hike was because of the weak yen, and that \"addressing the cost-of-living crisis has become an urgent policy issue.\"In November, Japan's cabinet approved a stimulus package totaling 21.3 trillion yen ($135.5 billion) as  Takaichi seeks to boost the country's slowing economy and offer support to inflation-hit consumers.",

Last week, Lululemon announced CEO Calvin McDonald would step down effective Jan. 31, following a year-long performance slump for Lululemon. Elliott has been working with former Ralph Lauren CFO and COO Jane Nielsen as a potential candidate, according to the person, who spoke on the condition of anonymity about confidential matters.In a news release announcing McDonald's departure, the company said its board of directors was working with a \"leading executive search firm\" to find its next CEO. The leadership change came as Lululemon's founder Chip Wilson has been calling on the company to make a change, saying earlier this year that the company's performance is \"in a nosedive.\"The athletic apparel company has been facing an increasingly crowded landscape, with athleisure entrants like Vuori and Alo Yoga. Nielsen served at Ralph Lauren from 2016 until April. Before that, she held roles at Coach and PepsiCo. Elliott has taken a stake in a slate of other companies as well this year, including a more than $2 billion stake in Workday and a $4 billion stake in PepsiCo. The Wall Street Journal earlier reported Elliott's Lululemon stake. ",

    "body": "Samuel Boivin | Nurphoto | Getty ImagesTikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew told employees on Thursday that the company's U.S. operations will be housed in a new joint venture.The entity is named TikTok USDS Joint Venture LLC, according to a memo sent by Chew and obtained by CNBC. As part of the joint venture, Chew said the company has signed agreements with the three managing investors: Oracle, Silver Lake, and Abu Dhabi-based MGX. He said that the deal's \"closing date\" is Jan. 22.Under a national security law, which the Supreme Court upheld in January, China-based ByteDance was required to divest TikTok's U.S. operations or face an effective ban in the country. In September, President Donald Trump signed an executive order approving a proposed deal that would keep TikTok operational in the U.S. by meeting the requirements of a law originally signed by former President Joe Biden. Chew noted that the new TikTok joint venture would be \"majority owned by American investors, governed by a new seven-member majority-American board of directors, and subject to terms that protect Americans' data and U.S. national security.\"The U.S. joint venture will be 50% held by a consortium of new investors, including Oracle, Silver Lake and MGX, with 15% each. Just over 30% will be held by affiliates of certain existing investors of ByteDance, and almost 20% will be retained by ByteDance, the memo said.The TikTok chief said the entity will be responsible for protecting U.S. data, ensuring the security of its prized algorithm, content moderation and \"software assurance.\" In addition to being an investor, Oracle will serve as the \"trusted security partner\" in charge of auditing and validating that it complies with \"agreed upon National Security Terms,\" the memo said. Sensitive U.S. data will be stored in Oracle's U.S.-based cloud computing data centers, Chew wrote.Oracle shares were up 5% in after-hours trading on Thursday.The new TikTok entity will also be tasked with retraining the video app's core content recommendation algorithm \"on U.S. user data to ensure the content feed is free from outside manipulation,\" the memo said.Chew noted that TikTok global U.S. entities \"will manage global product interoperability and certain commercial activities, including e-commerce, advertising, and marketing.\"Under Trump's executive order in September, the attorney general was blocked from enforcing the national security law for a 120-day period in order to \"permit the contemplated divestiture to be completed,\" allowing the deal to finalize by Jan 23. President Trump said in September that Chinese President Xi Jinping agreed to move forward with the proposal. Vice President JD Vance noted that there was \"some resistance\" from the Chinese government to support the deal that he said valued TikTok's U.S. business at $14 billion.ByteDance said in a statement in September that it would \"work in accordance with applicable laws to ensure TikTok remains available to American users through TikTok U.S.\"\"We thank President Xi Jinping and President Donald J. Trump for their efforts to preserve TikTok in the United States,\" ByteDance said at the time.WATCH: TikTok signs deal for sale of U.S. unit to joint venturewatch now",

    "body": "A shopper carries Nike bags in San Francisco, California, US, on Wednesday, Dec. 17, 2025.  David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesNike on Thursday posted quarterly earnings and revenue that topped Wall Street's estimates, as strength in North America helped to offset a plunge in China sales.The company's stock slid about 10% in extended trading Thursday, as investors digested the weakness in China and the sustained hit Nike is taking from higher tariffs.Here's what Nike reported for its second fiscal quarter of 2026, according to consensus estimates from LSEG:Earnings per share: 53 cents vs. 38 cents expectedRevenue: $12.43 billion vs. $12.22 billion expectedThe athletic apparel retailer said sales in North America rose 9% to $5.63 billion. But revenue in its Greater China market dropped 17% to $1.42 billion.The sneaker company is just over a year into CEO Elliott Hill's turnaround strategy, focusing on regaining its growth and market share, clearing out old inventory and investing in wholesale relationships.\"Fiscal year '26 continues to be a year of taking action to rightsize our classics business, return Nike digital to a premium experience, diversify our product portfolio, deepen our consumer connection, strengthen our partner relationships and realign our teams and leadership,\" Hill said on a call with analysts. \"And I say we're in the middle inning of our comeback.\"\"We're nowhere near our potential,\" he added.Hill said Nike's improvements in its China market are \"not happening at the level or the pace we need to drive wider change,\" though he said the country remains one of the company's most powerful long-term opportunities.Nike expects fiscal third quarter revenues to fall by a low single digit percentage, with modest growth in North America. It also anticipates gross margins will drop 1.75 to 2.25 percentage points – including a 3.15 percentage point hit from tariffs.The company said wholesale revenues climbed 8% to $7.5 billion during the quarter. But direct sales — which were a focus for Nike in the years before Hill took over and moved away from the strategy — fell 8% to $4.6 billion.Nike has also been feeling the impact of tariff increases. It said Thursday that its gross margin decreased by 3 percentage points and inventories dropped 3% primarily due to higher tariffs.watch nowThe sneaker company has been reporting weakness in its Converse brand, too. In its first fiscal quarter, Nike said Converse sales dropped 27% – on Thursday, it reported a 30% drop in revenues for the sneaker brand. Despite the weakness in some parts of Nike's business, the company highlighted some areas of strength and new initiatives ahead. CFO Matt Friend said on the call that Nike.com posted its best Black Friday ever this year, partially driven by its Air Jordan \"Black Cat\" launch.Nike also plans to launch a new footwear platform in January called Nike Mind, which aims to help athletes prepare for performance and competition, Hill said on the call.Nike has been making larger internal changes under Hill.Earlier this month, Nike underwent leadership changes to \"remove layers,\" according to Hill. Under its \"Win Now\" strategy, the company announced that Chief Commercial Officer Craig Williams would leave the sneaker giant. Hill called the shakeup a move \"about growth and offense.\"\"Collectively, these changes amount to us eliminating layers and better positioning Nike to continue to have an impact the way only Nike can,\" Hill said in a statement at the time.Nike shares have dropped more than 13% this year as of Thursday's close.",

    "body": "watch nowThursday saw the release of a much lighter-than-expected consumer price report for November, breaking from the recent trend of sticky inflation.Stocks jumped. Yields fell. Odds of a Federal Reserve rate increased.And many economists scratched their heads.The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that the consumer price index had an annual inflation rate of 2.7% last month, while core CPI — a measure that excludes volatile food and energy prices — was even lower at 2.6%. Both were below what economists had been estimating, as those polled by Dow Jones called for an annual headline rate of 3.1% and a rate on core CPI of 3%. The November data release Thursday was delayed by 8 days because of the U.S. government shutdown, but more importantly, the October data was canceled, leaving it to the BLS to make certain methodological assumptions about the prior month's inflation levels.Those assumptions in the methodology were not clear to economists and were not fully explained in the release.\"The downside surprise reflects weakness in both goods and services, but may be partly due to methodological issues. The BLS might have carried forward prices in some categories, effectively assuming 0% inflation,\" Michael Gapen, chief U.S. economist at Morgan Stanley, said in a note, deeming the November reading as \"noisy\" in a way that's \"difficult to draw strong conclusions.\" \"If these technical factors are the main source of weakness, we could see reacceleration in December,\" Gapen added.The main issue: OEREconomists were zooming in on one particularly important subset in the data as problematic: owners' equivalent rent. This is a key part of calculating the inflation seen in the housing market.UBS economist Alan Detmeister said the price changes in October for the OER appear to have been \"set to zero.\"Evercore ISI's Krishna Guha, digging deeper, said it appears the BLS \"put in zero inflation in multiple categories\" while calculating the OER for the approximately one-third of cities used.\"To the extent that it introduces a downward bias, the Fed would be mindful of the risk of taking the data on housing services inflation at face value,\" he wrote in a Thursday note.Detmeister said the impact of this could linger for the next few months.\"This weakness should be reversed with very large OER and tenants' rents increases in the April CPI released in May, but until then the price levels for OER and tenants' rent will be biased downward,\" he said.Stephanie Roth of Wolfe Research estimated that the 0.13% rise in rent and 0.27% increase in OER across the two-month period comes out to a respective climb of about 0.06% and 0.13% month over month.CNBC has reached out to the BLS for comment.There were other issues as well.Roth noted that there was likely downward pressure on certain goods categories since the BLS's data collection period took place later in November, a time when there's \"more holiday discounting.\"\"The market seems to be taking the data as a dovish signal, but given the technical quirks we expect the Fed will put less weight on this reading,\" she said in a note to clients. \"While its positive inflation doesn't appear to be rising strongly on the back of tariffs, there will likely be a bounce back as the data normalizes after the shutdown-related volatility.\"To be sure, there was already some skepticism toward the report in the leadup to its release, with some on Wall Street raising concerns around bias due to impacts from the shutdown, which ended in mid-November.The enthusiasm on Wall Street that followed the release eased as the trading day continued. Stocks were off their highs, with technology stocks doing most of the heavy lifting and shares more linked to the economy, such as banks, in the red. Yields were off their lows as well.— With reporting by Steve Liesman",

Management also upped its capital expenditures guidance to $20 billion from $18 billion and guided to 68% gross margins as memory prices rise and the company passes on costs to customers. \"We are more than sold out,\" said business chief Sumit Sadana. \"We have a significant amount of unmet demand in our models and this is just consistent with an environment where the demand is substantially higher than supply for the foreseeable future.

Authorities believe Neves Valente acted alone and that he eluded capture for days because he was traveling in a rental car whose license plates he kept changing. But authorities managed to track the rental, which was originally made in Boston, and were able to identify Neves Valente through that, and to learn that he had rented the storage unit in Salem where he was found.Brown University President Christina Paxson said, \"It is safe to assume that this man, when he was a student, spent a lot of time in that building,\" Barus & Holley, where Saturday's shooting occurred.The last class Neves Valente took at Brown was in 2001 before going on a leave of absence.Authorities said he is believed to have originally been in the United States on a student visa and obtained lawful permanent resident status in 2017.",

Starting Tuesday, customers in the U.S. and Canada can buy a 4-ounce portion filled with adobo chicken or steak.The move is designed to re-energize demand as the chain known for massive burritos and bowls is grappling with slowing sales growth and a fundamental shift in how Americans eat.\"For years, guests have used Chipotle's customizable offerings to build high protein and fiber-filled meals on their own,\" Chris Brandt, Chipotle's president and chief brand officer, said in a release.The company recently cut its full-year same-store sales forecast for the third consecutive quarter, triggering a nearly 20% single-day stock selloff. Multiple Wall Street firms lowered their price targets, citing weakening traffic, most sharply among customers ages 25 to 35, and fading visibility into a rebound.Chipotle stock is down around 38% year-to-date. Across the fast-casual sector, inflation-weary consumers have been pulling back on dining out, and analysts have told CNBC previously that Chipotle is battling a value perception problem, with some diners lumping the chain in with pricier fast-casual rivals despite average entree prices that are closer to $10.Beyond the protein cup, the High Protein Menu includes entrees such as the Double High Protein Bowl and the High Protein-High Fiber Bowl, with items ranging from 15 to 81 grams of protein per serving. \"This curated menu brings that fan behavior to the forefront with clean ingredients and flexible portions, making protein and other dietary goals easier to reach in just a few taps,\" Brandt said. watch nowSmaller, protein-dense portions allow Chipotle to compete not just with other restaurants, but with protein bars, shakes and convenience-store snacks, while potentially capturing visits outside of lunch and dinner.High-protein diets have ranked as the top diet pattern in the U.S. for three consecutive years, according to Chipotle. About 70% of Americans now say they prioritize protein, and more than one-third have increased their intake over the past year, according to the International Food Information Council.  The launch also comes against the backdrop of a dramatic shift in consumer behavior driven by GLP-1 weight-loss drugs and growing interest in macronutrient tracking. GLP-1 users, in particular, tend to eat smaller amounts while emphasizing protein to preserve muscle mass — a trend that is forcing restaurant chains to rethink portion sizes, menu structure and pricing.Chipotle isn't alone in pivoting toward protein-forward offerings. Fast-casual salad chain Sweetgreen recently introduced new menu items following the trend, headlined by a bowl with 106 grams of protein. ",

    "body": "U.S. President Donald Trump sits in the Oval Office to sign executive orders, at the White House in Washington, D.C., U.S., Dec. 18, 2025. Evelyn Hockstein | ReutersPresident Donald Trump signed an executive order Thursday directing federal agencies to reclassify marijuana, loosening long-standing restrictions on the drug and marking the most consequential shift in U.S. cannabis policy in more than half a century.The order, once finalized by the Drug Enforcement Administration, moves cannabis out of Schedule I classification — the most restrictive category under the Controlled Substances Act, alongside heroin and LSD — to a Schedule III classification, which encompasses substances with accepted medical use and a lower potential for abuse, such as ketamine and Tylenol with codeine.\"This action has been requested by American patients suffering from extreme pain, incurable diseases, aggressive cancers, seizure disorders, neurological problems and more, including numerous veterans with service-related injuries, and older Americans who live with chronic medical problems that severely degrade their quality of life,\" Trump said from the Oval Office on Thursday.  Also on Thursday, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, led by Dr. Mehmet Oz, is expected to launch a pilot program in April enabling certain Medicare-covered seniors to receive free, doctor-recommended CBD products, which must comply with all local and state laws on quality and safety, according to senior White House officials. The products must also come from a legally compliant source and undergo third-party testing for CBD levels and contaminants.Shares of cannabis conglomerates were down following the announcement, likely from worries of new compeititon from international companies.Trulieve's stock finished the day down about 23%, Green Thumb Industries fell more than 16% and Tilray Brands fell about about 4% as of close on Thursday. The AdvisorShares Pure US Cannabis ETF, which tracks American operators, slid almost 27%.\"Millions of registered patients across the United States, many of them veterans, rely on cannabis for relief from chronic and debilitating symptoms. We commend the administration for taking this historic step. This is only the beginning,\" Ben Kovler, founder and CEO of Green Thumb, said in a statement to CNBC. The reclassification is viewed by many analysts as a financial lifeline for the cannabis industry. The move exempts companies from IRS Code Section 280E, allowing them to deduct standard expenses like rent and payroll for the first time. It also opens the door for banking access and institutional capital previously sidelined by compliance fears. Many on Wall Street also expect the changes and the Medicare pilot to draw major pharmaceutical players into the sector to chase federally insured revenue.While CBD has surged in popularity in recent years, with infused consumer goods ranging from seltzers to skin care, the Food and Drug Administration has stopped short of granting the compound its full backing. Studies have found \"inconsistent benefits\" for targeted conditions, while FDA-funded research warns that prolonged CBD use can cause liver toxicity and interfere with other lifesaving medications. Currently, the FDA has only approved one CBD-based drug, Epidiolex, for rare forms of epilepsy.\"I want to emphasize that the order ... doesn't legalize marijuana in any way, shape or form, and in no way sanctions its use as a recreational drug,\" Trump said. Experts and industry insiders told CNBC this week that a reclassification could pave the way for more research into the effects of CBD use. ",

    "body": "The Eli Lilly & Co. logo at the company's Digital Health Innovation Hub facility in Singapore, on Thursday, Nov. 14, 2024.Ore Huiying | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesEli Lilly on Thursday said its closely watched obesity pill helped patients maintain the majority of their weight loss after they switched directly from taking the company's injection Zepbound and Novo Nordisk's rival shot Wegovy in a late-stage trial. The company also said it has filed for Food and Drug Administration approval of the daily GLP-1 pill, called orforglipron, for obesity. The FDA in November said it awarded a priority review voucher to that pill, which could expedite its review timeline to a few months. Shares of Eli Lilly rose more than 2% on Thursday after the announcement. The positive trial data suggests that the pill could be an effective treatment for patients to transition to if they want to preserve their weight loss but don't want to take weekly injections long term. Many people who stop those shots regain much of the weight they initially shed. While Eli Lilly's pill appears to cause less weight loss overall than existing injections, Thursday's results highlight its potential role as a needle-free maintenance treatment in the blockbuster GLP-1 market. But an oral pill for obesity from Novo Nordisk will likely enter the market first, giving the Danish drugmaker a head start in staking its claim in the space.The phase three trial followed more than 300 patients with obesity who previously took Wegovy or  Zepbound for 72 weeks in a separate late-stage study. Those people were then randomized to take either Eli Lilly's pill or a placebo for another 52 weeks. The oral drug met the trial's main goal of demonstrating superior weight loss maintenance compared with a placebo, among people who previously experienced a plateau in their progress while taking the injections. On average, patients who switched to the pill from Novo Nordisk's Wegovy only regained roughly 2 pounds of the weight they initially lost by the end of the trial. Meanwhile, on average, people who switched to the pill from Zepbound only regained around 11 pounds of the weight they initially lost by the end of the study. That means people in the Wegovy group maintained about 95% of their weight loss after switching, while those in the Zepbound group maintained roughly 80%. \"Obesity is a chronic, progressive disease, and sustaining weight loss remains a significant challenge for many,\" said Kenneth Custer, president of Lilly Cardiometabolic Health, in a release. He said the trial showed that the pill \"helped people maintain the weight they worked hard to lose\" and that, if approved, it could \"provide a convenient alternative for the millions of individuals living with obesity around the globe to continue their long-term health journey.\"While people in the Zepbound group appeared to regain more weight, the bigger focus is likely on those who transitioned from the drug's top competitor, Wegovy. In an October note, BMO Capital Markets analyst Evan Seigerman said positive results from the trial could give Eli Lilly \"the unique opportunity to capture revenue share\" from chronic treatment with semaglutide, the active ingredient in Novo Nordisk's Wegovy and diabetes injection Ozempic. \"Chipping away at the potential for Novo's flagship product,\" Seigerman wrote. In a note on Thursday, Leerink Partners analyst David Risinger said the data \"will help drive commercial success and upside to consensus expectations\" for Eli Lilly's pill. He said the firm expects the drug to rake in $2 billion in sales by the end of 2026, $9 billion by the end of 2027 and $16 billion by the end of 2028. Dr. Caroline Apovian, co-director of the Center for Weight Management and Wellness at Brigham and Women's Hospital, said the results were \"still great\" even though patients regained some of the weight they lost. But she said, \"in order for this to be a good switch, these orals are going to have to be less expensive for the insurance companies to cover than the injectables, right?\" Obesity injections currently carry list prices of roughly $1,000 per month before insurance, though both Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk have cut the direct-to-consumer prices of their drugs for cash-paying patients. It's unclear how the companies will price their respective pills. But under recent deals with President Donald Trump, the companies said starting doses of their upcoming oral drugs, pending approvals, will be $149 per month for everyone getting them through the direct-to-consumer website TrumpRx. That site launches in January. The overall safety and tolerability – or how well patients handle treatment – of the pill were consistent with previous late-stage studies. The most common side effects were gastrointestinal related and generally mild to moderate in severity. More CNBC health coverageThe Trump administration is changing Covid, childhood vaccine recommendations – here's what it means for youU.S. to impose 100% tariff on branded, patented drugs unless firms build plants locally, Trump saysEli Lilly to build $6.5 billion Texas manufacturing facility for obesity pill, other drugsAround 4.8% of people who switched to the pill from Wegovy discontinued treatment due to side effects, while 7.2% of those who switched to the oral drug from Zepbound did the same. Meanwhile, those rates were 7.6% and 6.3% among patients who switched to a placebo from Wegovy and Zepbound, respectively. No liver safety issues were observed, according to Eli Lilly. Full results of the trial, called ATTAIN-MAINTAIN, will be presented at an upcoming medical meeting and published in a peer-reviewed journal next year. Eli Lilly's pill works in a similar way to Wegovy, Ozempic and Novo Nordisk's diabetes pill Rybelsus, targeting a gut hormone called GLP-1 to suppress a person's appetite and regulate blood sugar. Novo Nordisk is also seeking approval of an oral version of Wegovy for obesity, which could come by year-end.But unlike those three treatments, Eli Lilly's pill is not a peptide medication. That means it is absorbed more easily by the body and does not require dietary restrictions like Rybelsus or oral Wegovy does.In a note in August, Goldman Sachs analysts forecast that pills will capture a 24% share — or around $22 billion — of the 2030 global weight loss drug market, which they expect to be worth $95 billion in total.They said they expect Eli Lilly's pill to have a 60% share — or roughly $13.6 billion — of the daily oral segment of the market in 2030. They expect Novo Nordisk's oral semaglutide to have a 21% share — or around $4 billion — of that segment.",

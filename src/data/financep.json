Alex Wong | Getty ImagesUnited Airlines CEO Scott Kirby said the federal government shutdown could hurt bookings if it continues.Despite the funding impasse, essential federal employees including Transportation Security Administration officers and air traffic controllers are required to work without pay. The shutdown started Oct. 1 as Congress failed to pass a funding bill.Speaking on an earnings call on Thursday, Kirby said the shutdown so far hasn't impacted the carrier's business.\"I think that at least for the first couple of weeks, people thought it was going to get resolved, so they just kind of continued business as usual,\" he said. \"But as time goes on, as people read headlines and say, 'it's not going to get resolved soon.' People start to lose confidence in the government and the government's ability to resolve this. And that's going to start to impact bookings.\"Kirby said there isn't an exact cutoff for when the airline could start to see an impact, but added \"every day that goes by, the risk to the U.S. economy grows. So I hope we will avoid an unforced error here.\"Read more CNBC airline newsAir traffic control shortages add to U.S. flight delays, FAA saysSpirit Airlines on track for a $475 million bankruptcy lifeline'Seconds count': Avoiding airplane collisions at airports could come down to cockpit alertsU.S. startup airline Breeze Airways plans first international flightsDelta Air Lines CEO Ed Bastian last week made a similar warning about how a prolonged shutdown could affect air travel but emphasized that the airline's operation hadn't been affected.The shutdown has raised concerns about already thin-staffing among air traffic controllers, the Federal Aviation Administration said.

    "body": "A shopper walks past shelves of cooking oil for sale at a supermarket in Beijing on October 15, 2025. Pedro Pardo | Afp | Getty ImagesPresident Donald Trump's tariffs will cost global businesses upward of $1.2 trillion in 2025, with most of the cost being passed onto consumers, according to a new analysis from S&P Global.In a white paper released Thursday, the firm said its estimate of additional expenses for companies is probably conservative. The price tag comes from information provided by some 15,000 sell-side analysts across 9,000 companies who contribute to S&P and its proprietary research indexes.\"The sources of this trillion-dollar squeeze are broad. Tariffs and trade barriers act as taxes on supply chains and divert cash to governments; logistics delays and freight costs compound the effect,\" author Daniel Sandberg said in the report. \"Collectively, these forces represent a systemic transfer of wealth from corporate profits to workers, suppliers, governments, and infrastructure investors.\"Trump in April slapped 10% tariffs on all goods entering the U.S. and listed individual \"reciprocal\" tariffs for dozens of other countries. Since then, the White House has entered a series of negotiations and agreements while also adding duties on a variety of individual items such as kitchen cabinets, autos and timber.While administration officials have insisted that exporters will be forced to bear the greater share of the levies, the S&P analysis suggests that is only partly true.In fact, the firm says that just one-third will be borne by companies, with the rest falling on the shoulders of consumers, under conservative estimates. The figures incorporated a $907 billion hit to covered companies with the remainder to uncovered firms as well as private equity and venture capital.\"With real output declining, consumers are paying more for less, suggesting that this two-thirds share represents a lower bound on their true burden,\" said Sandberg, who wrote the report along with Drew Bowers, a senior quantitative analyst at S&P Global.Political and policy stakesThe size of the tariff hit and the burden of the costs are critical both for the White House looking to sell the duties as essential to restoring a fair trade balance, and to policymakers at the Federal Reserve looking to calibrate the proper balance for monetary policy.\"The President and Administration's position has always been clear: while Americans may face a transition period from tariffs upending a broken status quo that has put America Last, the cost of tariffs will ultimately be borne by foreign exporters,\" White House spokesman Kush Desai said in a statement.\"Companies are already shifting and diversifying their supply chains in response to tariffs, including by onshoring production to the United States,\" he added.Fed officials have been inclined to look through the duties as a one-time hit to prices and not a source of underlying inflationary pressures. The S&P researchers found similar sentiment among analysts.The consensus looks for a 64 basis point contraction in profit margins this year, fading to 28 basis points for 2026 and then 8 to 10 basis points in 2027-28. A basis point equals 0.01%.\"In effect, 2025 locked in the hit; 2026 and 2027 will test whether the market's optimism about re-equilibration is warranted,\" the authors wrote. \"For now, consensus envisions a world where margins eventually recover to pre-tariff trajectories. Whether that faith proves justified will depend on how firms adapt through technology, cost discipline and reshaped global value chains that have defined this cycle.\"The impact also likely will depend on how Trump's tariff strategy evolves. The White House currently is back in heightened tensions with China over a rare earth dispute and Trump's intentions to retaliate.The S&P paper found that Trump's removal in May of the \"de minimis\" exception for goods under $800 was \"the real inflection point\" for how hard tariffs would bite. The exception had allowed low-priced goods to sail under previous tariff barriers, but \"had become politically untenable.\"\"When the exemption closed, the shock rippled through shipping data, earnings reports, and executive commentary,\" Sandberg said.\"In the optimistic scenario that this turbulence is temporary, the Trump administration's tariff agenda and the resulting supply chain realignments are viewed as transitory frictions, not permanent structural taxes on profitability,\" he added.",

    "body": "Michelle Bowman, vice chair for supervision at the US Federal Reserve, during the Federal Reserve Board Community Bank Conference in Washington, DC, US, on Thursday, Oct. 9, 2025. Eric Lee | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesRegulators are doing away with controversial rules that required banks to plan for losses in the event of climate-related events, according to an announcement Thursday.A joint release from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Reserve said they no longer believe the requirements are necessary as they are redundant with other provisions banks make to plan for emergencies and unusual events.\"The agencies do not believe principles for managing climate-related financial risk are necessary because the agencies' existing safety and soundness standards require all supervised institutions to have effective risk management commensurate with their size, complexity, and activities,\" a joint release from the three regulators said.Fed Governor Michael Barr, the former vice chair for supervision, issued a statement disagreeing with the move.\"Rescinding the principles is shortsighted and will make the financial system riskier even as climate-related financial risks grow,\" Barr said in a statement.Mission creepTrump administration officials have criticized the Fed for falling prey to mission creep, or exceeding the scope of its mandates for monetary policy and bank supervision. The climate change provisions, established in October 2023, were one point of criticism.Chair Jerome Powell has repeatedly stated that climate is not a direct Fed issue. The rules required banks, as part of routine testing, to list potential losses they might suffer from climate-related issues.Governor Michelle Bowman, a Trump appointee who succeeded Barr as the Fed banking supervisor, praised the move rescinding the rules as part of an attempt at \"refocusing the supervisory process on material financial risk.\"\"Rescission of the climate principles is an important step in this process,\" Bowman said. She criticized the climate rules, saying \"the effect of this guidance was to create confusion about supervisory expectations and increase compliance cost and burden without a commensurate improvement to the safety and soundness of financial institutions or to the financial stability of the United States.\"While acknowledging the risks that climate change poses, Bowman said the Fed's mission does \"not extend to climate policymaking.\"",

    "body": "A sign is posted in front of a Genentech office on June 12, 2025 in South San Francisco, California. Justin Sullivan | Getty ImagesRoche's Genentech on Thursday said it will sell its flu pill, Xofluza, directly to certain patients at a discount in a bid to expand access, becoming the latest company to wade into the direct-to-consumer space. It follows similar moves by other drugmakers to simplify how Americans get their medicines, and comes as companies face pressure from the Trump administration to lower U.S. drug prices. Genentech's new program also launches ahead of the flu season, which typically peaks in the winter months. The 2024 to 2025 flu season was the most severe in more than a decade, according to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data. Genentech's new program aims to reach uninsured patients, those with limited coverage or people whose plans don't cover the pill, according to a release. The company will provide access to Xofluza through three pharmacies with a $50 cash pay option, which is 70% lower than the pill's current list price before insurance. That includes Mark Cuban's direct-to-consumer pharmacy Cost Plus Drug Company, Amazon Pharmacy and Fuze Health's Alto Pharmacy. Genentech said same-day home delivery is available in certain markets through the latter two pharmacies. Home mail delivery is also available nationwide through all three pharmacies for people who want to use Xofluza as a prevention treatment. The pill is a single-dose antiviral treatment for people ages 5 and above, typically taken within 48 hours of the onset of flu symptoms. Xofluza costs over $150 for one treatment, according to some drug price websites. On top of the new effort, Genentech also offers a coupon that allows eligible patients to pay as little as $35 for their Xofluza prescription, with up to $70 off at most pharmacies.Trump in July sent letters to 17 drugmakers urging them to take specific steps to curb costs for patients, including by launching direct-to-consumer sales models for their medicines. Companies had to respond by Sept. 29. Since then, Pfizer and AstraZeneca have inked deals with Trump to lower drug prices. It was part of his effort to revive a controversial plan called the \"most favored nation\" policy, which aims to tie the prices of some drugs in the U.S. to the significantly lower ones abroad.",

Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., said, \"I will vote yes on a military appropriations bill to pay our men and women in uniform, but if it has all of the House poison pills, no.\"Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, a New Hampshire Democrat who voted for the bill, said, \"I believe it is critical that the Senate and Congress return to a bipartisan appropriations approach and try to begin rebuilding trust.\"\"This vote would allow us to consider Senate appropriations bills which were passed out of committee with overwhelming bipartisan support,\" Shaheen said. \"The bipartisan Senate appropriations defense bill will protect our national security and would ensure our men and women in uniform receive pay and benefits,\" she said.\"We can, and should, try to move forward on a bipartisan appropriations process even as we work to prevent tens of millions of Americans from seeing a massive spike in their health insurance premiums in the coming days.\"",

    "body": "watch nowA Republican bill to end the government shutdown failed in the Senate for the 10th time on Thursday, leaving lawmakers at a stalemate as the lapse in federal funding stretched into its third week.  The resolution came up short in a 51-45 vote that fell mostly along party lines. Sixty senators are needed to approve any stopgap bill; Republicans hold a narrow 53-seat majority in the Senate.Earlier Thursday, Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly called on President Donald Trump to get involved in the negotiations between Republican and Democratic senators to break the impasse.\"I think we need the president to make that happen, that he needs to engage with Mike Johnson and John Thune,\" Kelly said on CNBC's \"Squawk Box,\" referring to the Republicans who are the speaker of the House and the Senate majority leader, respectively.\"They seem to follow his lead on everything. That's the way this ends,\" the Arizona senator said.The sticking point in passing a funding deal is that Democrats insist that any such bill extend enhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies, which are set to expire at the end of 2025.A Democratic bill to keep in place those extra subsidies, which about 22 million Americans use to reduce the cost of their Obamacare health plans, is expected to cost nearly $1.5 trillion over a decade.\"The president has talked about how he wants this fixed. He wants these subsidies to be dealt with,\" Kelly said.\"So he agrees we should open the government and we should fix the subsidy issue under the Affordable Care Act, and that's all we want,\" Kelly said. \"So I don't see what the issue is.\"Thune and other Republicans have said they would be willing to discuss whether to extend enhanced ACA tax credits after a short-term funding extension is approved.In an interview Thursday with MSNBC's \"Morning Joe,\" Thune said, \"We are happy to sit down and talk about a solution on the ACA, tax credits, but that needs to happen in a separate context, you know, away from having the government open.\"Johnson, in an interview on \"Squawk Box\" on Thursday, said, \"This is not a health care fight. This is a very simple funding fight. It always was.\"\"They have created a red herring. The subsidies don't expire until the end of the year,\" Johnson said.\"We were always planning to have the thoughtful debate and deliberation over that in the month of October and November, before the subsidies expired. They know that. They grabbed that issue from the end of the year and pulled it back into September to try to pretend like that was the issue. It never was,\" Johnson said.The speaker also said there \"needs a dramatic amount of reform\" with the ACA subsidies, \"if indeed they're going to be extended.\"Punchbowl News reported on Thursday that \"there's a bipartisan group of senators discussing several different potential off-ramps\" to the shutdown stalemate \"involving the enhanced Obamacare subsidies.\"\"The group, led in part by Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.), is discussing the possibility of holding two side-by-side votes intended to end the shutdown,\" Punchbowl reported, cited people familiar with the matter.\"The first vote would be to reopen the government, while the second would be on a one-year extension of the Obamacare enhanced premium tax credits, plus a commitment to pass a longer-term solution by a date certain.\"",

    "body": "The TSMC logo is displayed on a building in Hsinchu, Taiwan April 15, 2025. Ann Wang | ReutersTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. on Thursday reported a 39.1% increase in third-quarter profit from last year, beating estimates and hitting a fresh record as demand for artificial intelligence chips stayed strong.Here are the company's results versus LSEG SmartEstimates:Revenue: 989.92 billion New Taiwan dollars ($33.10 billion) vs. NT$977.46 billion expectedNet income: NT$452.3 billion, vs. NT$417.69 billion TSMC's revenue in the September quarter rose 30.3% from a year ago to NT$989.92 billion, also beating estimates. Net income increased 13.7% from last quarter, which had marked a record high at the time.As Asia's largest technology company by market capitalization, TSMC has benefited from the artificial intelligence boom, producing advanced AI processors for clients such as Nvidia and Apple.\"Recent developments in AI market continue to be very positive,\" TSMC CEO C.C. Wei said on an earnings call, adding that increasing adoption of AI models by consumers has led to more demand for compute, and by extension, semiconductor products. \"Thus, our conviction in the AI megatrend is strengthening,\" he added.Bolstered by this AI strength, Wei said the company had raised its 2025 revenue growth forecast to the mid-30% range. In July, the company had expected full-year revenue growth of about 30%.TSMC also increased its expected floor for capacity expansion and upgrades to $40 billion for the full year, up from a previous floor of $38 billion.Cutting-edge chipsTSMC's high-performance computing division, which encompasses artificial intelligence and 5G applications, made up the majority of sales in the July-September quarter, accounting for 57% of revenue.TSMC said advanced chips, with sizes 7-nanometer or smaller, accounted for 74% of TSMC's total wafer revenue in the quarter. In semiconductor technology, smaller nanometer sizes signify more compact transistor designs, which lead to greater processing power and efficiency. watch nowGrowth in TSMC's most advanced chips particularly drove revenue gains in the third quarter, according to Counterpoint Research senior analyst William Li.\"TSMC's robust earnings are a direct reflection of the strong traction at 3nm as well as high utilization at 4/5nm – both of which are being driven by ongoing orders from AI GPU and HPC customers and premium smartphone platforms,\" Li told CNBC in a statement. TSMC executives also said Thursday that they were monitoring U.S. tariff developments as Taiwan negotiates for a lower \"reciprocal\" rate and Washington weighs industry-specific duties on semiconductors. However, TSMC is likely to receive some exemptions. \"We understand there are uncertainties and risks from the potential impact of tariff policies, especially in consumer-related and price-sensitive market segments,\" Wei said, adding that the company would continue to monitor and plan for any impact. TSMC has been investing heavily in facilities in the U.S. — spending that could help reduce its exposure to tariff impacts.Shares of TSMC in Taiwan have risen more than 38% so far this year.",

Michael Short | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesSalesforce shares rose as much as 5% in extended trading on Wednesday after the software vendor issued new financial targets for the next few years.The company said it now expects revenue of more than $60 billion in 2030, above the $58.37 billion consensus among analysts polled by LSEG.The guidance excludes impact from the pending acquisition of data management company Informatica. The $8 billion deal, announced in May, is slated to close in the fiscal fourth quarter or in the first quarter of the 2027 fiscal year.\"We have had some lower-stage growth for a while,\" Robin Washington, Salesforce's chief operating and financial officer, said during an investor briefing at the company's annual Dreamforce conference in San Francisco. \"That is reaccelerating.\"The company called for an organic year-over-year revenue growth rate above 10% in the 2026 through 2030 fiscal years. The growth rate has been under 10% since mid-2024.Investors have been concerned, in part because of the rise of \"vibe-coding\" tools for automatically generating software with a few words of human input. Industry observers have predicted that artificial intelligence services might threaten longstanding software providers. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said in April that AI is creating up to 30% of new code at the company.\"There's a certain amount of, let's just say, nonsense that's out there,\" Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff said on Wednesday. \"Like, for example, that these products are writing all the software, and that is not what's happening.\"As of Wednesday's close, Salesforce's stock had fallen 29% for the year, while the Nasdaq has gained 17%.To increase revenue, Salesforce is counting on its Agentforce software for automating customer service and other business processes, said Washington, who also sits on Salesforce's board. The company introduced Agentforce last year as a way for brands to add chat-based customer service agents that connect large language models to internal data.\"Investors continue to ask why Agentforce adoption has been slower than anticipated,\" analysts at RBC Capital Markets wrote in a note to clients earlier this month.Salesforce executives are hoping product enhancements will attract more business.The company on Monday released Agentforce Voice, which allows clients to have agents answer customer service calls. On Tuesday, Salesforce announced larger partnerships with AI model developers Anthropic and OpenAI, bringing their latest models to Agentforce.At Dreamforce, Salesforce pointed to Agentforce adoption at FedEx, Pandora, PepsiCo, Williams Sonoma and other companies.WATCH: People don't understand Agentforce is part and parcel of Salesforce, says CEO Marc Benioffwatch now",

    "body": "Jefferies headquarters in New York, US, on Wednesday, Aug. 23, 2023.Jeenah Moon | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesStock Chart IconStock chart iconZION and KRE, 1-dayThe bankruptcies of two auto industry-related companies this year have raised concerns about loose lending practices, especially in the opaque private credit market. That's left both the banking industry and investors concerned about whether instances of loans gone wrong indicate a burgeoning crisis.The latest signs of trouble came when Zions said Wednesday evening it faced a sizable charge because of bad loans to a couple of borrowers. Despite expecting this was an isolated incident, the bank said that it will encourage its counsel to have an independent review.Western Alliance then alleged Thursday a borrower had committed fraud. That rattled investors despite the company saying it could reaffirm its guidance and 2025 outlook.\"While  we  are  questioning  why  all  of  these  credit  'one offs'  are  seemingly occurring in a short period of time, the reality is that even though these exposures may be 'well-contained' and have a 'limited financial impact,' this is an industry where investors — especially those that are new to this sector — tend to 'sell first and ask questions later,' especially when it comes to elevated credit concerns,\" JPMorgan banking analyst Anthony Elian wrote in a Thursday note to clients.Looking for 'cockroaches'The worries about the health of the banking industry originated with the bankruptcies of companies related to the auto sector: First Brands and Tricolor Holdings.Auto parts maker First Brands went bankrupt last month and announced this week that founder Patrick James stepped down as chief executive. The Ohio-based company is facing a Justice Department criminal investigation, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing people familiar with the matter.Shares of Jefferies, which has exposure to First Brands, fell more than 10% on Thursday. The investment bank's stock has lost more 25% in October, making it poised to record its worst month since the Covid pandemic took hold in March 2020.Jefferies said that hedge funds it runs are owed $715 million from companies tied to First Brands, while UBS said that it has about $500 million in exposure.\"When you see one cockroach, there are probably more,\" JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon said on the company's earnings conference call earlier this week in relation to First Brands and Tricolor Holdings fallout.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconJEF, 1-monthJPMorgan did not have exposure to First Brands, but did take a $170 million charge-off last quarter from Tricolor.\"I asked Jamie Dimon the question about these problems, and you heard, when you see one cockroach, there's probably a few more,\" said Mike Mayo, senior banking analyst at Wells Fargo. \"Investors are looking around for cockroaches. That's what's happening.\"An 'opaque' marketMayo said credit quality in the overall industry is still considered favorable. However, he said the recent developments show the low margin for error when there's hiccups in the credit market.Additionally, because the private credit market is so \"opaque,\" there can be a \"major wave of concern without really knowing if there is even a problem,\" said Peter Corey of Pave Finance.This week's lending revelations mark the latest challenge in recent years for regional banks. The industry went through a crisis in 2023 that began with the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank.Alternative and other asset managers also suffered in the Thursday downdraft resulting from concern about the health of some loans.Blue Owl Capital dropped more than 7%, while Ares Management and Blackstone fell more than 6% and 3%, respectively. Apollo Global Management lost more than 5% and Carlyle Group declined around 4%.To be sure, the declines in major banks were relatively subdued Thursday. JPMorgan shed more than 2%, while Bank of America lost around 3.5%.A bull market in stocks and the booming private credit market this year has calmed investors nerves about whether there is a systemic crisis emerging. The stock market Thursday appeared to be dragged lower by the decline in regional banks, leading the S&P 500 to finish lower.\"Today, I think, the risk to the bank space is idiosyncratic,\" said Timothy Coffey, associate director of depository research at Janney Montgomery Scott. \"The risk to the insured bank space for private credit could be more systemic, as well as the risk to credit quality from a weakening economy.\"— CNBC's Hugh Son, John Melloy and Scott Schnipper contributed to this report.",

David Ake | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesThe U.S. budget deficit edged lower for 2025 as record-setting tariff collections helped offset what also were unprecedented numbers for payments on the spiraling national debt, the Treasury Department announced Thursday.In a year marked by a bruising trade war and high financing costs, the federal government managed to escape with a $1.78 trillion shortfall, some $41 billion, or 2.2%, less than in fiscal 2024.While that's still on the high end historically, the red ink would have been still worse had it not been for a massive surge in customs duties and a September surplus of $198 billion that also set a record for the month.President Donald Trump's tariffs were a major contributor to tariff collections of $202 billion for the year, representing a 142% surge from 2024. September saw $30 billion in tariff payments, up 295% from the same period a year ago.Treasury officials estimated Thursday that the dip in the budget shortfall will bring the ratio of deficit to gross domestic product to 5.9%. The measure has not been below 6% since 2022 and generally runs around the 3% area except in times of economic stress.In an interview last week, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, noting Congressional Budget Office estimates that the deficit-to-GDP number would be below 6%, said \"we're on our way\" to reducing the debt and deficit burden.The impact from the deficit was felt in interest paid on the $38 trillion national debt.Interest on the debt totaled more than $1.2 trillion, also a record and nearly $100 billion higher than the 2024 outlay.Excluding interest that the Treasury earns on its investments, net interest payments totaled $970 billion, topping defense spending by $57 billion and behind only Social Security, Medicare and health care costs in the national budget.Trump slapped controversial tariffs on U.S. imports earlier this year despite protests that they would spike inflation and hurt consumers, resulting in lower demand and a hit to economic growth.While there have been signs of price increases in tariff-sensitive items, the moves have been mostly incremental. Federal Reserve officials say they likely will lower their benchmark interest rate further as they expect any price increases to be temporary. The current fed funds rate stands at 4.00% to 4.25%.The government's fiscal year ended in September, with the U.S. collecting $5.2 trillion in revenue over the prior 12 months while spending just over $7 trillion.",

David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesEssilorLuxottica said a healthy amount of its revenue growth in the third quarter was due to its partnership with Meta, primarily from its Ray-Ban brand, to develop and sell smart glasses.\"Clearly there is a lift coming from Ray-Ban Meta wearables as a product category,\" CFO Stefano Grassi said on the company's third-quarter earnings call.The European eyewear company said sales in in the quarter grew 11.7% year-over-year to 6.9 billion euros (about $8 billion) from 6.44 billion euros a year earlier. Of that growth, more than 4 percentage points came from wearables, which includes the Meta products, the company said. In 2019, Meta and Luxottica inked a deal for Ray-Ban Meta branded smart glasses. Most recently, Luxottica's Oakley brand has joined the partnership, with the debut in June of the Oakley Meta HSTN smart glasses. The companies are also working on a version of the smart glasses to be released under the Prada brand, CNBC reported in June.Luxottica, which also oversees several popular brands like Vogue Eyewear and Persol, has been heavily pushing internet-connected glasses that work with Meta's AI-powered digital assistant. The technology allows users to play music, take photos and perform other actions similar to how they would use smartphones.\"We believe that glasses will be the future,\" Grassi said, adding that the wearables business is profitable. \"Glasses will materially replace most of the functionality that today we have embedded into our phones.\"Grassi's statement echoes sentiments expressed by Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, who said in July that \"Personal devices like glasses that understand our context because they can see what we see, hear what we hear, and interact with us throughout the day will become our primary computing devices.\"A couple weeks into the fourth quarter, Grassi said he has \"a good degree of optimism\" for the period, in part because of the rollout of \"all the new products that have been recently presented at the Meta Connect,\" which will \"all play a role in our fourth-quarter profile.\"At the Connect event in September, Zuckerberg revealed the $799 Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses, which have a small digital display that can be manipulated with an accompanying wristband powered by neural technology. The company also unveiled new smart glasses, including the $499 Oakley Meta Vanguard glasses and the $379 Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2) glasses.Grassi said that Luxottica's sales growth in North America in the third quarter had more to do with the Ray-Ban Meta glasses than the effects of tariffs, which led to higher prices for its products.He said the company will be able to reach the 10 million unit capacity that it had originally planned to hit by the end of 2026 earlier than anticipated.\"The overall ecosystem of wearables is going to bring not only revenue associated with the hardware but also the revenue associated with lenses\" and over time from services tied to AI.EssilorLuxottica shares rose 2.4% on Thursday. Meta isn't the only tech giant getting into the burgeoning smart glasses market.Alphabet announced in May a $150 million partnership with Warby Parker to develop smart glasses powered by Google's Gemini AI digital assistant, while China's Alibaba unveiled its smart glasses in July that utilize its Quark AI assistant. Apple and OpenAI are also reportedly developing smart glasses.WATCH: Arm CEO Rene Haas on new partnership with Meta.watch now",

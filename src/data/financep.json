    "body": "This is the season when everyone's planning for next year. When it comes to money, I can assure you that the secret isn't in some fancy investing tactic, hot stock tip, or obscure cryptocurrency. If you and your partner set just one money resolution for 2026, make it this: You both stay actively involved in your finances.As a financial advisor for more than 20 years who's operated my own wealth management firm for nine, I know that this is the single most impactful commitment most couples can make. Yet it's missing in so many relationships. The dangers of disconnecting Leaving the money to be handled by one spouse leaves your family vulnerable. If something happens to the person handling everything (illness, death, or even divorce), the other is left to scramble. I've helped heartbroken spouses try to piece together accounts, passwords, and plans during the worst moments imaginable, and I wouldn't wish this outcome upon anyone. But even in less dramatic circumstances, it's still ineffective to leave one overwhelmed person to make all the decisions. You miss out on the power of two perspectives, and the disengaged spouse loses their agency and confidence. I've sat across from countless couples who, even with the best intentions, have lost the plot over time. Most of them never addressed the subtle shifts in their dynamic that made it easier for one partner to take the lead with their money. I'd often end up with just one client at our financial planning meetings, and their partner, I was told, was too busy, disinterested, apprehensive, or overwhelmed to join us. For a long time, I didn't understand why, until it happened in my own home. 'This isn't working anymore'During the pandemic, my wife, Heather, was juggling too much: lawyering in the general counsel's office of a Fortune 100 company, moonlighting as my business consultant for my wealth management firm, and keeping me and our two daughters clothed, fed, entertained, and safe. As a result of the physical, mental, and emotional labor she was carrying for all of us, she disconnected from our household finances. Money felt like the one thing she didn't have to worry about. In truth, it was the one thing I was willing to own from start to finish, and it was damaging to our relationship. I'm grateful she had the courage to say, \"This isn't working anymore.\" The tough conversations that followed caused us to rethink what we wanted out of our careers, how we divided labor, and how we could approach money as a team again. Make yourselves a money teamTalking about money is never just about money, which inspired Heather and me to spend two years interviewing other couples for our new book, \"Money Together: How to Find Fairness in Your Relationship and Become an Unstoppable Financial Team.\" Effective communication is the bedrock. Here are some ways to connect with intention, move beyond the numbers, and engage in your finances together — even when it's the harder thing to do.Start with an honest review. Schedule a distraction-free time and place to get into everything. Do you both have access to your accounts? Are all passwords saved in your password managers? You should both have a baseline understanding of your net worth. Review what you earn (cash flow), what you have (assets and investments), what you owe (debt), and what you want (goals). Examine time, from each of your perspectives. Ask whether each of you feels you have the time to do what you want and need to do. You may need to shuffle responsibilities and automate or outsource less-critical tasks to free up time for finances. Create a regular practice. Make recurring money dates non-negotiable. We suggest having them quarterly, which won't become overwhelming and will create enough space between meetings to recognize real progress.  Meet your partner where they are. I've often encountered couples where one partner has less knowledge or comfort with all things finances than the other, and that, in part, is why they've disengaged. It can feel daunting. Tailor your approach to your partner's learning style, checking in to see what resonates.Bring in outside help if needed. A neutral financial advisor or therapist who specializes in money dynamics can guide tough conversations without bias, and offer financial advice that's tailored to your specific situation. When Heather and I finally reconnected around money, it secured our wallets and also deepened our relationship. Make 2026 the year you prioritize staying connected to your finances together — I know from experience just how transformative it can be. Douglas A.

    "body": "It isn't just difficult family dynamics or the prospect of stretching a budget to purchase expensive gifts that can make the holiday season stressful. Workplace concerns, like not meeting all your goals, looming deadlines and burnout, can also surface at the end of the year. According to Patricia Dixon, a licensed clinical psychologist and adjunct professor at National Louis University in Tampa, it's normal to feel a bit overwhelmed with work stress around the holidays.As we reflect on the past year, we may feel inclined to \"focus too much on what we haven't done\" Dixon tells CNBC Make It. \"And then it makes us lose sight of what we have.\"Whether you're having a hard time unplugging or battling with feeling like you haven't done enough, here are some tips from Dixon, and other psychologists, for successfully overcoming end-of-year stress.Focus on your accomplishments, not your shortcomingsMaybe you didn't get that big promotion you'd been eyeing since January. Or you didn't launch the business you've been thinking about. That doesn't mean you don't have any wins to be proud of at the end of the year, says Dixon.\"Reset your perspective for more clarity and accuracy,\" she says. \"There might be this pile up of things that are still left to do, but look at all the things you have done that gives you a sense of accomplishment.\"For example, even if you didn't get a promotion, your boss still gave you a raise because of your hard work and dedication to your team. And if you didn't get your business off the ground, at least you solidified a plan and got your license or permit in preparation.Wins, no matter how small or insignificant they may seem, are still wins, says Dixon. \"If we're focused too much on the end and not the process, we're missing the little celebrations in between that make it a little bit easier to carry the weight.\"Listen to your mind and bodyOver half (55%) of U.S. employees are feeling burned out, according to the Eagle Hill Consulting Workforce Burnout Survey, which polled over 14,000 respondents and was conducted in November.Those employees reported that burnout negatively impacted their efficiency, job performance and creativity. Rather than put your health on the back burner in an effort to overperform or maintain your reputation as a reliable team member, Judith Joseph, a psychiatrist and researcher who specializes in mental health and trauma, says it's important to listen to your mind and body, and set boundaries when you need to. \"Take a pause before you say 'yes' or 'no' to a task, and ask yourself if you really want to do it,\" Joseph wrote for CNBC Make It in April. \"Very often, there's a small voice inside of us that realizes we're too burned out to work all weekend.\"That's especially true at the end of the year, when you're in the thick of family time or trying to take a few days to yourself to recharge, adds Dixon.'Embrace your inner toddler'If you're feeling overwhelmed with work, Dixon, the author of \"Embrace Your Inner Toddler: A Blueprint for Living Joyfully,\" says her best advice is to live like a three year old.There are four fundamentals to life as a toddler: play time, snack time, nap time and the \"unapologetic no\" — when a youngster firmly puts their foot down and has no intention of caving to their parents' requests, Dixon explains.In adulthood, this can look like taking a 15-minute break in between work tasks to play Sudoku or Wordle, packing your favorite energizing snack for a mid-day boost, taking a few moments for meditation or breathwork, and saying no to extra work that you don't have the bandwidth for.Of course, we want to take our careers seriously and finish the year strong. However, we can still find ways to enjoy our work without letting it consume us, says Dixon.\"There's a way to take your career seriously without taking yourself too seriously,\" she says. A race to climb the corporate ladder can have \"detrimental effects on our mental, emotional and physical well-being. It's about knowing when to rest and knowing what your limits are.\"Want to give your kids the ultimate advantage? Sign up for CNBC's new online course, How to Raise Financially Smart Kids.

    "body": "A 2025 poll from the C.S. Mott Children's Hospital at the University of Michigan asked American parents of children ages one to 18 about their views on various child health topics including bullying, internet safety, lack of physical activity, parental stress and diet.The Mott poll report, released in August, found that a majority of parents surveyed, 69%, think the physical health of American children and teens is getting worse. And even more parents are worried about their kids' emotional wellbeing: 83% believe the mental health of U.S. children and teens is also on the decline.Results of the poll also show that parents believe social media, too much screen time, and internet safety to be some of the top concerns kids are facing today.\"Since the increased use of social media starting around 2010, the prevalence of mental health problems in youth has also increased significantly,\" according to the report. \"This increase, particularly in depression, anxiety and suicidal thoughts continued through the COVID-19 pandemic years.\"Jonathan Haidt, social scientist and author of \"The Anxious Generation,\" is one of the many experts sounding an alarm about the connection between increased anxiety and depression among young people and smartphones and social media.\"All these devices are designed to keep kids scrolling for hours and hours,\" he previously told CNBC Make It. \"The average screen time is eight to 10 hours, not including school.\" \"We have to roll that back if we want any hope for them to grow up healthy,\" he said.Haidt encourages parents to be more intentional about reducing their child's use of devices and social media. Here, he and Jean Twenge, a psychology professor and author of \"10 Rules for Raising Kids in a High-Tech World,\" offer up some recommendations for how parents can work to get that done.No smartphones before high schoolHaidt argues for a clear boundary: Kids should not get a smartphone before they reach high school. A global study of 27,969 18-to-24-year-olds by nonprofit Sapien Labs found that mental wellbeing improved the older the age of first ownership of a smartphone. Haidt also recommends parents refrain from enabling the use of social media on kids' phones before the age of 16.When kids get their devices, Haidt suggests parents have a designated place for them.\"They live on the kitchen counter,\" Haidt said as an example. \"If you need it, you check it out.\"No screens in the bedroom overnight Twenge advocates for keeping screens out of the bedroom overnight.\"That's just a situation where there's, kind of, no argument: 'You do not need that phone in your bedroom when you are supposed to be sleeping. Period. End of story. Mic drop. We're done,'\" Twenge previously told CNBC Make It.Devices in the bedroom can disrupt children's sleep, whether they're up late scrolling or their notifications are waking them up. \"Not getting enough sleep is a risk factor for just about everything we'd like our kids to avoid, from getting sick to feeling depressed,\" Twenge wrote in her book \"10 Rules for Raising Kids in a High-Tech World.\"Haidt would go a step further: no screens in the bedroom whatsoever, he said.More free play outside To ensure kids don't get too sucked into their devices, Haidt also recommends parents encourage them to spend time outside with friends.Communities can decide to enact what he calls \"free play Fridays.\"\"Everyone knows that's when kids get together at the park, they play baseball, football, whatever,\" he previously told Make It. \"Maybe they just stay at the school playground.\"Ultimately, playing with friends and without screens is \"the most fun kids can have,\" he said. They might have so much, they'll ask to continue spending time with their friends over the weekend. Want to give your kids the ultimate advantage?

    "body": "Mary Barra, CEO of General Motors, attends the annual Allen and Co. Sun Valley Media and Technology Conference at the Sun Valley Resort in Sun Valley, Idaho, on July 8, 2025.David A. Grogan | CNBCDETROIT — General Motors is on pace to be the top U.S.-traded automaker stock of 2025, as shares of GM are having their best year since the Detroit company's reemergence from bankruptcy in 2009.GM stock is up over 55% to a record of more than $80 per share, as of Friday's close, topping the company's previous annual increase of 48.3% last year. That includes a nearly 13% rise so far in December, adding to five consecutive months of share gains, according to FactSet.Several factors have been driving the share increase. But GM CEO Mary Barra and other executives have contended for years that the automaker's stock has been significantly undervalued given its consistent earnings performance.\"Great vehicles, innovative technology, a rewarding customer experience, along with strong financial results, will continue to set GM apart in an increasingly competitive landscape,\" Barra said during the company's last quarterly earnings call in October.Amid the stock's run-up, Barra has significantly cut her position in the company. She has exercised options or sold roughly 1.8 million shares this year, valued at more than $73 million, according to public filings confirmed by GM. As of the last public filing in September, Barra still owned more than 433,500 shares valued at over $35 million, with much of her annual awards granted in options and stock.GM's stock performance compares with a 17% yearly increase for Tesla as of Friday's close, a 34% jump for Ford Motor and a 15% loss for Chrysler parent Stellantis. Other U.S.-traded automakers such as Honda Motor and Toyota Motor have had smaller annual gains.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconAuto stocksGM 's most recent quarterly earnings were a major catalyst for Wall Street analyst bullishness that led to reratings and price target increases after the third quarter.The automaker's quarterly adjusted earnings per share have topped Wall Street estimates every quarter except the second quarter of 2022 over the past five years, according to average expectations of analysts compiled by FactSet. Wall Street analysts overall have cited GM's cash generation, earnings resilience and track record in delivering shareholder returns, including stock buybacks, as reasons for their optimism. The automaker also is expected to greatly benefit from regulation changes under the Trump administration, despite ongoing tariffs. UBS recently increased its 12-month price target on GM stock by 14% to $97 per share, while naming the company its top autos pick heading into 2026. Morgan Stanley earlier this month also upgraded GM to overweight, with a $90 per share price target.\"In our view, General Motors leads the D3 in the North America and Global market with steady unit sales growth, [average transaction price] growth, disciplined incentive spend, and inventory management. This has resulted in better [earnings before interest and taxes] margin and return metrics than peers,\" Morgan Stanley analyst Andrew Percoco said in a Dec. 7 investor note.Read moreGM stock has cumulatively been in the black on a weekly basis since June. The largest weekly gain of 19.3% occurred when the automaker reported its third-quarter earnings on Oct. 21. Those results beat Wall Street's expectations and the company raised its annual guidance, adding that next year's earnings are expected to be better than 2025's.GM stock's has also seen a boost from some external factors. The Trump administration has loosened U.S. fuel economy and emissions standards, removed related penalties that were imposed under the Biden administration, and renegotiated its trade deal with South Korea, a major manufacturing hub for GM. Meanwhile, the industry has been seeing a slowdown in less profitable EV sales.\"GM is effectively a regional (NA) [automaker] and we believe they are well positioned to benefit from the relaxed US regulatory environment (emissions and fuel economy),\" UBS analyst Joseph Spak said in a Dec. 15 investor note raising the per share price.GM CFO Paul Jacobson earlier this month said the company will continue stock buybacks.\"As long as the stock remains as undervalued as it is, the priority is to buy back shares. And I think you'll continue to see that from us going forward,\" he said during a UBS investor conference.GM is rated overweight with an $80.86 target price, according to analyst averages compiled by FactSet.— CNBC's Michael Bloom contributed to this report.Correction: Lucid shares are down for the year.

Isaacman, a close ally of SpaceX CEO Elon Musk, told CNBC's \"Closing Bell Overtime\" that Trump's recommitment to exploring the moon is key to unlocking the \"orbital economy.\"\"We want to have that opportunity to explore and realize the scientific, economic and national security potential on the moon,\" he said. Isaacman's comments on Friday were some of his first public remarks since being confirmed to his position by the Senate last week, after a long saga throughout 2025. Trump initially nominated Isaacman for the NASA head role in December 2024, but the president abruptly pulled his pick in May due to Isaacman's \"prior associations.\" Although Trump did not specify what those were, some have suggested that it was related to Isaacman's close ties with Musk, with whom Trump had a heated feud over the summer.In November, Trump renominated Isaacman, who was an entrepreneur and became a civilian astronaut after commanding an orbital mission aboard SpaceX's Crew Dragon spacecraft in 2021.Lunar opportunities include establishing space data centers and infrastructure, as well as potentially mining Helium-3, a rare gas embedded in the moon's surface that could become a major fuel for fusion power, Isaacman said. He added that after building a \"moon base,\" NASA will look into making investments in nuclear power and space nuclear propulsion to further exploration.NASA is currently working with various contractors including SpaceX, Jeff Bezo's Blue Origin and Boeing, to participate in its Artemis campaign, a moon exploration program that also aims to prepare for Mars missions.The campaign was propelled after Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill Act allocated $9.9 billion to NASA earlier this year.The Artemis II mission, NASA's first test flight with crew aboard the Space Launch System rocket and the Orion spacecraft, is expected to take off in the near future, Isaacman said.The expedition will be followed up with the Artemis III mission, which SpaceX is contracted to build the lunar landing system for.SpaceX and Blue Origin are refining heavy lift launch vehicles with on-orbit cryogenic propeller transfer to become more readily reusable, he added.\"That's what's going to enable us to be able to go to and from the moon affordably, with great frequency, and set up for missions to Mars and beyond,\" Isaacman said.",

Ukranian Presidency | Anadolu | Getty ImagesUkraine's president, Volodymr Zelenskyy, said Monday that he has asked for up to 50 years' worth of security guarantees for Ukraine during his meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump at the weekend.Commenting on the talks with Trump in Florida on Sunday, Zelenskyy told journalists that he said a meeting with Russia would only be possible after the president and European leaders had agreed on a framework peace deal for Ukraine. The comments, reported by Reuters on Monday, included Zelenskyy stating that he had asked for security guarantees for up to 50 years for Ukraine, but that the current 20-point peace plan envisaged guarantees — aimed at deterring future Russian aggression — for 15 years.

Any peace plan should be put to the Ukrainian people in a referendum, he added, noting that any vote to approve or reject the agreement should be held during a 60-day ceasefire. Zelenskyy said \"Russia clearly does not want a ceasefire for now\" after several days of heavy drone and missile attacks on Ukraine. Ukraine's comments come after talks with Trump at Mar-a-Lago in Florida on Sunday. Trump said the discussions had gone well but acknowledged that \"one or two very thorny issues\" remained.\"I do think we're getting a lot closer, maybe very close,\" Trump told reporters after emerging from the talks.Meanwhile, Zelenskyy described the talks as a \"really great discussion\" in which security guarantees were \"100% agreed\" upon, but Trump gave a slightly lower estimate when asked about that part of the proposal.watch nowWhen asked by a reporter what issues remain unresolved, Trump said it was about \"the land.\"\"Some of that land has been taken,\" Trump said. \"Some of that land is maybe up for grabs, but it may be taken over the next period of a number of months, and you are better off making a deal now.\"Moscow has demanded that Ukraine cede the eastern Donbas region to Russia and has rejected security guarantees for Kyiv so far. For its part, Ukraine has repeatedly rejected calls for the Donbas, which is mostly but not fully occupied by Russian forces, to be handed to Moscow. It's unclear whether Zelenskyy would meet face-to-face with Russian President Vladimir Putin if a peace agreement was agreed in principle, with both leaders vehemently refusing to meet in the past.Trump said he had spoken with Putin about peace proposals during a phone conversation on Sunday but signalled that Russia had not appeared to support a ceasefire to allow for a referendum in Ukraine. He divulged few other details about the call, which he said lasted two hours. When asked to comment on the U.S.-Ukraine talks which followed that call, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters on Monday: \"We don't know how they went. We can't judge. After these talks, the two presidents — I mean the President of Russia and the President of the United States — agreed to have a phone call again. Then we'll get the information.\"— CNBC's Hugh Son contributed reporting to this story.",

    "body": "President Donald Trump speaks to the media next to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu upon arrival for meetings at Trump's Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Florida, Dec. 29, 2025.Jonathan Ernst | ReutersPresident Donald Trump on Monday appeared open to additional military action against Iran if the country attempts to build up its reserves of ballistic weapons and reestablish its nuclear program. However, he urged the country to negotiate.\"Now, I hear that Iran is trying to build up again, and if they are we're going to have to knock them down. We'll knock them down. We'll knock the hell out of them. But hopefully that's not happening,\" Trump said, standing beside Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\"I heard Iran wants to make a deal. If they want to make a deal that's much smarter,\" the president continued.Trump gaggled with reporters at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida ahead of a meeting there with Netanyahu, which comes at a fraught time for the Middle East and amid heightened tensions between Israel and Iran. NBC News reported earlier this month that Netanyahu and Israeli officials were becoming more concerned that Iran was attempting to ramp up its ballistic missile production — which had been damaged earlier this year by Israeli strikes — and reconstitute the nuclear enrichment sites the U.S. bombed in June.\"If they will continue with the missiles, yes.

The first phase of the agreement took effect in October and has mostly held. But a second phase — which would call on Hamas to disarm and require Israeli military forces to withdraw — has proven more challenging. Netanyahu has said the second phase cannot begin until Hamas returns the remains of the final deceased Israeli hostage. Trump said on Monday that he hopes to proceed to the second phase \"as quickly as we can. But there has to be a disarmament ... we have to disarm with Hamas.\"Foreign policy in focusForeign policy has dominated Trump's schedule of late. On Sunday, he hosted Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at Mar-a-Lago. The Trump administration is facilitating negotiations between Ukraine and Russia to try to bring an end to the multiyear conflict between the two nations. During the meeting, Zelenskyy reportedly had asked the U.S. for security guarantees for up to 50 years for Ukraine, though the current 20-point peace plan outlined guarantees for 15 years.Trump also said he had a \"very productive\" call with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Monday, though he said a few \"thorny issues\" stand in the way of ending the war.\"We have a couple of issues that we're going to get resolved, hopefully, and if we get it resolved, you're going to have peace,\" Trump said.In the short, wide-ranging press conference on Monday, Trump offered updates on his monthslong pressure campaign against Venezuela.The president confirmed a U.S. strike on a drug loading facility in Venezuela, marking an escalation in his campaign against Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro. \"There was a major explosion in the dock area where they load the boats up with drugs .... So we hit all the boats, and now we hit the area,\" Trump said. \"It's the implementation area, that's where they implement, and that is no longer around.\"Trump has recently designated the Venezuelan government a \"foreign terrorist organization,\" ordered a complete blockade on sanctioned oil tankers moving in and out of the country and has been targeting alleged Venezuelan drug boats.",

    "body": "Nvidia founder and CEO Jensen Huang looks on as US President Donald Trump speaks at the US-Saudi Investment Forum at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington, DC on Nov. 19, 2025.Brendan Smialowski | AFP | Getty ImagesIt's been two days since news broke that Nvidia was spending $20 billion to acquire top talent from Groq in what the chip startup called a \"non-exclusive licensing agreement.\"Nvidia, the world's most valuable company, hasn't issued a press release or regulatory filing and, according to a spokesperson, is only confirming the contents of Groq's 90-word blog post published after the close of holiday-shortened trading on Wednesday. \"They're so big now that they can do a $20 billion deal on Christmas Eve with no press release and nobody bats an eye,\" said Stacy Rasgon, an analyst at Bernstein, in a Friday interview with CNBC's \"Squawk on the Street.\" While neither company confirmed the price tag, CNBC learned from Groq lead investor Alex Davis on Wednesday that Nvidia had agreed to buy assets from Groq, a designer of high-performance artificial intelligence accelerator chips, for $20 billion in cash. Davis' firm, Disruptive, has invested more than half a billion dollars in Groq and led the startup's latest financing round in September at a $6.9 billion valuation.Groq founder and CEO Jonathan Ross along with Sunny Madra, the company's president, and other senior leaders \"will join Nvidia to help advance and scale the licensed technology,\" the startup said in the post, adding that it will continue as an \"independent company,\" led by finance chief Simon Edwards.watch nowAs an acquisition, Groq would mark by far Nvidia's largest in its 32-year history. Its biggest prior purchase happened in 2019, when Nvidia bought Israeli chip designer Mellanox for close to $7 billion.But Nvidia is instead following a playbook used by other tech giants over the last couple years, spending billions of dollars to hire top talent in AI and to get access to key technology through licensing agreements. It's a strategy that's been employed by Meta, Google, Microsoft and Amazon. Nvidia itself previously used the tactic, shelling out more than $900 million in September to hire Enfabrica CEO Rochan Sankar and other employees at the AI hardware startup, and to license the company's technology, CNBC reported at the time.By avoiding traditional acquisitions, tech companies have been able to skirt some level of antitrust scrutiny and quickly close deals to bring in the people they most covet. \"Antitrust would seem to be the primary risk here, though structuring the deal as a non-exclusive license may keep the fiction of competition alive,\" Rasgon wrote in a note to clients on Thursday. His firm recommends buying Nvidia shares and has a $275 price target on the stock.Shares of Nvidia rose about 1% on Friday to $190.53. The stock has gained 42% this year and is up thirteenfold since the end of 2022, when generative AI started taking off following the launch of OpenAI's ChatGPT.Nvidia has been using its expanding cash pile to spread capital across the AI ecosystem, including through recent investments in OpenAI and Intel. At the end of October, Nvidia had $60.6 billion in cash and short-term investments, up from $13.3 billion in early 2023.Widening the 'competitive moat'Groq was founded in 2016 by a group of former engineers, including Ross. He was one of the creators of Google's tensor processing units, or TPUs, the search giant's custom chips that are being used by some companies as an alternative to Nvidia's graphics processing units, or GPUs. Groq's specialty is on the inference side of the market, which refers to the the use of AI to make decisions based on new information. Nvidia dominates the training piece of the market, which involves teaching AI models to learn from patterns in large amounts of data. Analysts at Cantor said in a report Friday that Nvidia is \"playing both offense and defense\" by snapping up Groq's assets, keeping them from potentially landing in the hands of a competitor. \"We think this acquisition only enhances Nvidia's full system stack and overall leadership in the AI market (and only widens its competitive moat),\" wrote the analysts, who kept their buy rating and $300 price target. BofA Securities analysts also maintained their buy recommendation and $275 target following the announcement. In a note Friday, they characterized the deal as \"surprising, expensive but strategic,\" and said it shows Nvidia recognizes that \"while GPU dominated AI training, the rapid shift towards inference could require more specialized chips.\"The analysts said that key questions remain, such as who will own Groq's language processing unit intellectual property, whether it can be licensed to Nvidia competitors and whether what's left of Groq — its nascent cloud business — could possibly \"undercut NVDA's LPU-based service with lower pricing.\"Nvidia isn't commenting on any of those details for now. The first opportunity analysts and investors will likely get to hear from the company will be Jan. 5, when CEO Jensen Huang is scheduled to speak at CES in Las Vegas. — CNBCs David Faber contributed to this reportWATCH: Nvidia GPUs to Google TPUs — Breaking down all the AI chipswatch now",

    "body": "watch nowCNBC's Jim Cramer gave advice on how to build a balanced portfolio, suggesting investors both individual growth stocks and index funds.\"Putting some money in an index fund isn't bad advice — it's a good way to play it safe,\" Cramer said. \"But most people can't afford to purely play it safe unless they're already rich, which is why you have to put the other half of your holdings in a mix of individual stocks that you choose and a non-stock hedge.\"Picking one's own stocks can be lucrative, Cramer asserted. But the practice is also risky, he indicated, so investors need index funds as a backup to hedge against inevitable investing mistakes. Index funds are average by design, Cramer continued, saying they are meant to mirror American business. He indicated that index funds alone don't necessarily make as much money as a top growth stock can. He suggested investors looking to earn above average returns should buy several stocks across different industries, as well as a commodity holding like gold or crypto. Cramer emphasized it's wise to seek out good growth stocks, which are ones that have done well historically. It's also important to \"put the work in,\" when managing a portfolio, Cramer said, which means continually researching companies, keeping up with their earnings reports and following industry news.\"Of course, it's better to be average than broke,\" he said. \"Which is why I still advise putting half of your savings in an index fund like the SPY, but you need to use the other half to go after bigger gains.\"",

    "body": "The logo of Japanese company SoftBank Group at the company's headquarters in Tokyo on November 21, 2025.         Kazuhiro Nogi | Afp | Getty ImagesJapan's SoftBank on Monday said it has agreed to buy data center investment firm DigitalBridge for $4 billion as part of its artificial intelligence push.The deal, which has been unanimously approved by a special committee of DigitalBridge's board of directors, will see SoftBank acquire all the outstanding common stock of DigitalBridge for $16 per share in cash. This represents a 15% premium to DigitalBridge's closing share price on Dec. 26. The deal is expected to close in the second half of next year, according to a SoftBank statement.SoftBank CEO and Chairman Masayoshi Son said the acquisition \"will strengthen the foundation for next-generation AI data centers\" and advance the firm's vision to become a leading \"Artificial Super Intelligence\" platform provider.\"As AI transforms industries worldwide, we need more compute, connectivity, power, and scalable infrastructure,\" Son said in a statement.Shares of DigitalBridge jumped about 10%. The firm's share price had climbed as much as 50% after Bloomberg reported a deal could be imminent.The agreement between SoftBank and DigitalBridge comes amid a global boom for the infrastructure that underpins AI applications.\"The buildout of AI infrastructure represents one of the most significant investment opportunities of our generation,\" DigitalBridge CEO Marc Ganzi said in a statement.SoftBank's \"vision, capital strength, and global network will allow us to accelerate our mission with greater flexibility, invest with a longer-term horizon on behalf of our investors, and better serve the world's leading technology companies as they scale their AI ambitions,\" he added.SoftBank recently sold its entire stake in U.S. chipmaker Nvidia for $5.83 billion to make room for its investment in OpenAI.DigitalBridge describes itself as \"a unique digital infrastructure business,\" and had roughly $108 billion of assets under management as of the end of September, according to its website.

    "body": "The growing wealth and enhanced spending power of the over-50s is poised to accelerate a range of investment opportunities across multiple sectors in the U.K., according to investors.Market pros say this age group — dubbed the \"Grey Pound\" or \"Silver Spenders\" — is gaining greater control over its assets. With greater wealth and more discretionary income, a larger chunk of this demographic is increasingly seen as the new \"idle rich.\"Dan Coatsworth, head of markets at AJ Bell, said that the over-50s were an increasingly influential demographic within the consumer space.\"Those still working might be well advanced in their career, paid off their mortgage, and have lots of disposable cash. They might have worked hard for decades and feel like they deserve to splash the cash,\" Coatsworth told CNBC.\"Those in retirement might be in the generation that received generous defined benefit pension schemes and collect a tidy sum to fund an extravagant lifestyle,\" he added.Coatsworth said the group wants to protect as much of their wealth as they can from taxation, which means seeking advice on tax, investments, and general financial planning.Compounding assetsAlyx Wood, co-founder and chief investment officer at Kernow Asset Management, said there was a clear subset of winners and losers within this cohort.Day-to-day life for \"a lot of\" them is still \"quite tough and normal,\" but there are others who are \"just absolutely nailing it in terms of compounding their assets,\" he said.This latter wealthier segment is developing an appetite for luxury goods \"that they've never had before,\" as well as for \"higher-end\" wealth management and insurance services.These customers are increasingly seeking out \"content, story, getting involved, a purpose\" that extends beyond traditional passive returns, Wood added.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconHiscox.He highlighted names like insurance group Hiscox and privately-owned wealth managers Evelyn Partners as potential winners as older consumers turn to certain premium wealth management and insurance products.\"The banks are trying to buy back into the wealth management industry,\" said Wood, pointing to the reported interest in Evelyn Partners from NatWest Group and Barclays as private equity owners Permira and Warburg Pincus seek to exit. \"I expect you'll see a few of those.\"Wood, a contrarian stock picker whose hedge fund specializes in U.K. equities, last month outlined a major position on Saga plc at the annual Sohn London investment conference, which he said was also partly a wager on the strength of the \"Silver Pound.\"He said people living their \"Saga years,\" a reference to the travel and insurance brand that focuses on the over-50s, will account for about 60% of all U.K. consumer spending by 2030.Saga — which makes up about 10% of Kernow's portfolio — is a \"materially undervalued\" business, whose share price could surge over 400% in the next few years, Wood added.'The list goes on'Wood said that Pets At Home, the London-listed specialist retailer of pet food, toys, and accessories, was another name facing near-term pressures that could ultimately emerge as a beneficiary of the trend, as older consumers buy more for their pets and spend less on their children.\"Experiences and material goods will rank highly on their list of places to spend money – such as holidays, nice meals, fancy cars, home renovations, beauty products, wellness,\" Coatsworth said of the cohort. \"The list goes on.\"Stock Chart IconStock chart iconPets At Home.Coatsworth also said that the healthcare sector was a likely winner, as an ageing population will mean rising demand for medicine and treatment.\"Private care homes, retirement villages and property investors with medical providers as tenants are among the winners from this trend,\" Coatsworth told CNBC via email.",

    "body": "A selection of one kilogram silver bars at Conclude Zrt bullion dealer arranged in Budapest, Hungary, on Monday, Feb. 17, 2025. Akos Stiller | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesOne of the best trades of the year just staged a massive reversal.Silver futures fell 8.7% on Monday, after topping $80 an ounce for the first time ever in overnight trading. The precious metal settled at $70.46 an ounce. It was the worst day for silver futures since February 2021.The move is even more dramatic on an intraday basis. Peak to trough, silver plunged 15%, the biggest high-to-low change going back to August 2020 when it dropped 16.85%. \"This is a historic move,\" said Jeff Kilburg, CEO and chief investment officer of KKM Financial. \"We haven't seen a move like this in a long time.\" Stock Chart IconStock chart iconSilver futures for March, year to dateHe attributed the pullback to profit-taking, as well as tax-loss harvesting at the end of a calendar year, that dented silver's advance after its huge run-up. The precious metal is still higher by more than 140% year to date. It started 2025 trading just above $20 per ounce.That has helped the precious metal outperform even gold this year. Gold futures for February, which recently topped $4,550 for the first time ever this month, are higher by more than 60% this year. Gold futures dropped about 4.6% on the day, settling at $4,343.6. There are a number of reasons for the huge gains. Alongside gold, silver is viewed as a safe haven for investors wary of heightened geopolitical tensions and other risks, like the ballooning U.S. deficit. The two metals are also viewed as stores of value, meaning they can act as hedges against a U.S. dollar that weakens due to inflation or economic uncertainty. Additionally, a weaker greenback also makes the assets cheaper for other countries, driving up demand. What's more, silver benefited from strong industrial demand for electronics such as solar panels, data centers and electric vehicles.KKM Financial's Kilburg expects those tail winds can continue to push silver higher in 2026. He thinks silver can climb to $90 or even $100, implying upside of roughly 27% or 40%, respectively, from where it was last trading. \"I think this is a reset, a reprieve, just a one-day end-of-year move. But I think both precious metals — gold and silver — continue their trajectory higher,\" said Kilburg. \"There's a dramatic supply issue. There's a tremendous demand issue. And you couple those two together, that is going to push silver higher,\" he said. \"So, I don't think the rally is over by any means.\" — CNBC's Chris Hayes contributed to this report. ",

Michael Nagle | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesMore than 1,400 U.S. flights were canceled and 11,000 were delayed over the weekend after a major winter storm hit the Northeast U.S., putting carriers to the test during one of the busiest travel periods of the year.Snowfall totals in the area were less than the earlier forecast, though New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport and Newark Liberty International Airport in New Jersey each recorded more than four inches of snow, according to the National Weather Service.More than 130 flights, about a fifth of the scheduled departures from Kennedy Airport, were canceled, according to flight-tracking site FlightAware. Another 87 were canceled from New York's LaGuardia Airport, about 20% of the day's scheduled departures, and 72, or 12%, of departures from Newark were scrubbed.Airlines canceled more than 1,700 flights on Friday, most of them ahead of the storm. Nearly 400 U.S. flights were canceled for Sunday, according to FlightAware. American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, United Airlines, Southwest Airlines, JetBlue Airways and other carriers last week waived change fees for restrictive basic economy tickets. They said they won't charge a difference in fare for any other customers flying in and out of a host of airports in the Northeast U.S.Customers must travel by the end of the year if they change their flights, the airlines said. Flying as early as possible is likely the best bet with few seats available during the busy Christmas week.Airlines for America, the industry lobbying group, expects carriers to fly a record 52.6 million people between Dec. 19 and Jan. 5, with this Friday and Sunday among the busiest days.Airlines generally cancel flights ahead of time for major weather events in the forecast, like blizzards or hurricanes, to avoid planes, connecting travelers and crews from getting stranded and worsening disruptions.Read more CNBC airline newsAmerican Airlines no longer lets basic economy flyers earn milesArchitect of Delta's premium strategy to retire in FebruaryFrontier Airlines replaces longtime CEO Barry Biffle with carrier's presidentSouthwest CEO says airline 'actively pursuing' network of airport lounges",

    "body": "Zepto isn't the only quick commerce startup in India, and competition is heating up both domestically and globally. The country's online grocery market is set to be worth around $24 billion dollars by 2025, according to Redseer.ZeptoIndian quick-commerce startup Zepto has confidentially filed for an initial public offering, according to a public notice issued by the company on Sunday. The company plans to raise 110 billion rupees ($1.22 billion) of fresh capital. Zepto was valued at $7 billion during its last funding round in October, data from research firm Tracxn showed.Zepto told CNBC it filed its draft prospectus under the confidential route, which keeps its filings private, and declined to disclose further details. Rising competitionQuick commerce, which promises deliveries in as little as 10 minutes, has become one of India's most competitive consumer internet sectors.While e-commerce giant Amazon has long offered same-day delivery services in India through \"Amazon Fresh\", the launch of its 15-minute \"Amazon Now\" service in June marked an aggressive shift into a crowded space.The Jeff Bezos-owned U.S. company has started its quick commerce operations across Indian's three major cities—Mumbai, Delhi and Bengaluru.Amazon India's Country Manager Samir Kumar said on Dec. 1, that it plans to have well over 300 micro-fulfillment centers across Bengaluru, Delhi and Mumbai by the end of the year.\"India's quick commerce market is currently 10% of its e-commerce market, but in the medium to long term it could account for 40%-50%,\" Karan Taurani, executive vice president at Indian broking firm Elara Capital, told CNBC's Inside India last week.Walmart-owned Flipkart also launched its quick commerce service in 2024. Indian food delivery companies, Swiggy and Eternal, which owns Zomato and Blinkit, were among the first movers in this space.Over the last three to five years, several companies have entered the quick commerce market in India and are \" indulging in a price war\" as firms chase a large total addressable market, Taurani said.watch nowBubble concernsThe sector has continued to attract large sums of capital. Earlier this month, Swiggy raised 100 billion rupees from institutional investors to expand its quick commerce fulfilment network, including warehouses located closer to dense neighborhoods.But some industry leaders have warned that the pace of spending may not be sustainable. Blinkit Chief Executive Albinder Dhindsa has reportedly warned of a bubble bursting.He told Bloomberg that the quick commerce industry has relied heavily on \"relentless fundraising\" to cover steep losses and that companies would soon face limits on how long they can continue absorbing them.Zepto's losses reportedly widened in fiscal year 2025 to 33.67 billion rupees from 12.15 billion rupees a year ago. Data from LSEG showed that Swiggy reported a net loss of 31.17 billion rupees in FY25, up from 23.50 billion rupees the year before, while Eternal reported net income of 5.27 billion rupees in FY25.\"If companies don't move to the path of profitability, there could be a bubble,\" Taurani said.",

    "body": "Venezuelan opposition leader and Nobel Peace Prize winner María Corina Machado waves to supporters outside the White House following a meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump on January 15, 2026 in Washington, DC.Chip Somodevilla | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesNorwegian lawmakers reacted with shock and dismay over Venezuela opposition leader María Corina Machado's decision to present U.S. President Donald Trump with her Nobel Peace Prize medal.\"It's completely unheard of,\" Janne Haaland Matlary, a professor of international politics at the University of Oslo and former state secretary in the foreign affairs ministry, told public broadcaster NRK on Friday.She called Machado's gesture \"disrespectful\" and \"pathetic,\" saying it undermined the value of the prize, which the Norwegian Nobel Committee awards annually. Raymond Johansen, a Norwegian lawmaker for the center-left Labour Party and former governing mayor of Oslo, said in a Facebook post it was \"incredibly embarrassing and damaging to one of the world's most respected and important prizes,\" according to a Google translation.Machado, who met Trump at the White House for the first time on Thursday, said the gift to the U.S. president was a \"profound expression of gratitude for the invaluable support of President Trump and the United States to the Venezuelan people.\" It comes after a U.S. military operation seized Venezuela's president, Nicolás Maduro, on Jan. 3.The U.S. president thanked Machado on social media, describing it as a \"wonderful gesture of mutual respect.\" The White House later posted a photo of Trump and Machado, with the U.S. president holding up a large, gold-colored frame displaying the medal.A bust of Swedish chemist, engineer, inventor, businessman, and philanthropist Alfred Nobel (1833-1896) is pictured outside the Norwegian Nobel Institute in Oslo, Norway on January 8, 2026.Jonathan Nackstrand | Afp | Getty ImagesThe Nobel Peace Center, a museum in Norway's capital dedicated to the Nobel Peace Prize, said in a post on X: \"A medal can change owners, but the title of a Nobel Peace Prize laureate cannot.\"The Norwegian Nobel Committee and the Norwegian Nobel Institute had previously said: \"The facts are clear and well established. Once a Nobel Prize is announced, it cannot be revoked, shared, or transferred to others. The decision is final and stands for all time.\"\"Whoever has received the prize has received the prize,\" Trygve Slagsvold Vedum, leader of Norway's Centre Party, told NRK. \"The fact that Trump accepts the medal says something about him as a type: a classic scapegoat who will adorn himself with other people's awards and work,\" he added. The White House was not immediately available to comment when contacted by CNBC on Friday.'Politics over peace'Trump has frequently spoken about his desire to be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. The White House responded to the Nobel Committee's decision to award Machado the medal in October last year by saying they had \"proved they place politics over peace.\"Some Norwegian lawmakers appeared happy to brush off Machado's gesture, however, saying it should not be seen as an indication of who the award rightfully belongs to.Read moreDag-Inge Ulstein, leader of Norway's center-right Christian Democratic Party, told NRK that there is \"no doubt\" that the Nobel Peace Prize still belongs to Machado.Ine Eriksen Søreide, Norway's former defense minister and a member of the center-right Conservative Party, agreed with Ulstein.\"Even though Trump has now received the medal, it does not mean that he has received the Peace Prize,\" Søreide said.",

    "body": "A pharmacist displays a box of Wegovy pills at a pharmacy in Provo, Utah, US, on Thursday, Jan. 15, 2026. George Frey | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesShares of Novo Nordisk rose more than 8% on Friday after early prescription data showed an encouraging start to the U.S. launch of the company's new GLP-1 pill for obesity.In a Friday note, TD Cowen analysts called it a \"solid start\" for the first-ever weight loss pill, but said \"one data point does not make a trend.\" They cautioned that they need to see more data to fully assess what early demand is like for the Wegovy pill, which officially launched on Jan. 5 after winning approval in late December. Still, the initial data is a boost to the Danish drugmaker's hopes of winning back more market share from its chief rival, Eli Lilly, this year in the booming obesity and diabetes drug space. Eli Lilly won the majority market share in early 2025 and is trailing closely behind Novo Nordisk in the pill space, as it prepares for the upcoming launch of its own oral drug for obesity.In a Friday note, Leerink Partners analyst David Risinger said the Wegovy pill had around 3,100 prescriptions filled in the first week of the launch, citing IQVIA data for the week ending Jan. 9. Eli Lilly's popular obesity injection, Zepbound, had around 1,300 prescriptions filled in the first week of its commercial launch, and roughly 8,000 in the second week, he noted. That injection won U.S. approval in late 2023. The TD Cowen analysts cited slightly different data published by Symphony through Bloomberg. The analysts said around 4,290 prescriptions were filled for Novo Nordisk's pill during its first full week of launch, with the majority being for the starting dose of the drug. They added that the data from their source or IQVIA likely don't include prescriptions through Novo Nordisk's direct-to-consumer pharmacy or its telehealth partners. The analysts said that compares to the roughly 1,900 prescriptions filled for Zepbound during its first full week on the market. Assuming the Symphony data is accurate, the pill \"it is already outstripping its injectable counterparts at the same stage of their launch,\" TD Cowen analyst Michael Nedelcovych wrote in the note. A more direct comparison between the pill and the injections can be made based on available data early next week, though the figures may not prove more useful for another two to three quarters, he added. Nedelcovych said he wants to see the full picture on the direct-to-consumer channel, which holds \"significant promise\" for the pill's launch. Demand could also shift once Eli Lilly's pill, orforglipron, enters the market in the next few months, he added. While Novo Nordisk's drug has a head start, it is a peptide medication with dietary requirements – no food or drink for 30 minutes after taking the pill with water – that may hinder uptake. Eli Lilly's pill is a small molecule drug and not a peptide, meaning it does not have those restrictions. watch now",

    "body": "watch nowA survey released Friday by corporate insurer Axis Capital shows there's a growing divide across the C-suite on how executives view the risks, rewards and impact of cutting-edge AI technology.  On one hand, artificial intelligence is rapidly improving cybersecurity defense technologies, but AI is also equipping cybercriminals with sophisticated tools and creating new risks. \"When you think about AI, it is not merely a cyber challenge. This technology presents unique burdens, liabilities, challenges and opportunities to CEOs and boards alike,\" Axis CEO Vincent Tizzio told CNBC in an exclusive interview. Axis surveyed 250 CEOs and chief information security officers across the U.S. and U.K. on how AI is reshaping the cyber risk landscape. The survey found that while CEOs tend to view AI as a driver of productivity and competitive advantage, CISOs tend to see the technology as a source of increased exposure to risks like data leaks. Asked how confident they were that AI would strengthen their companies' cybersecurity, 19.5% of CEOs said they weren't confident compared to 30% of CISOs saying they lacked that confidence.\"The rapidity of change that's going on in AI renders reconsideration of the purchases that they're making and taking around the tools that they're bringing to the company,\" Tizzio said.The study also found that AI is generally viewed positively among both U.S. and U.K. executives, although U.K. respondents expressed more caution than those in the U.S. While 85% of U.S. leaders said they felt prepared for AI threats, only 44% in the U.K. said they felt prepared. Cybersecurity is a major investment priority for executives as ransomware attacks have nearly doubled over the past two years, with 82% of respondents saying they plan to increase their cybersecurity budgets over the next 12 months.  \"I haven't met a fellow CEO or board member that doesn't talk about the critical importance of discussing cyber as an exposure to the company's well-being,\" Tizzio said.

Francis Chung | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesWhite House economic advisor Kevin Hassett said Friday that large U.S. banks could voluntarily provide credit cards to underserved Americans as a means to address President Donald Trump's affordability push.A week ago, Trump called for banks to cap credit card interest rates at 10%, an idea that has been roundly rejected by industry executives and their lobbyists this week.Now, Hassett, who is director of the National Economic Council, is floating a different plan, this one more narrowly focused on consumers who don't have credit access but have the income to justify credit lines.\"They could potentially voluntarily provide for people who are in that sort of sweet spot of not having financial leverage very much because they don't have access to credit, but they have enough income and stability in their lives so they're worthy of credit,\" Hassett told Fox Business host Maria Bartiromo. \"Our expectation is that it won't necessarily require legislation, because there will be really great new 'Trump cards' presented for folks that are voluntarily provided by the banks,\" he said.The comments could indicate that the administration is downgrading its efforts for broad changes to the card industry that would be difficult to enact and that could hit consumer spending and the economy. This week, bankers discussing fourth-quarter results said that rather than offering cards at a 10% interest rate, as Trump has said should happen by Jan. 20, the banks would simply close many customers' accounts.Hassett's statement came in response to a question about whether bankers would be forced to comply with Trump's rate cap, a move that would probably require new legislation.  The administration has been talking with \"CEOs of many of the big banks who think that the president's onto something,\" Hassett said. A major credit card issuer and a bank lobbyist representing big lenders told CNBC that they haven't yet had any discussions with the administration about the \"Trump card\" concept.watch now",

Memory is used in AI systems to keep large amounts of data close to the graphics processing unit, or GPU, so it can run large AI models without slowing down.\"AI driven-demand is accelerating,\" Micron CEO Sanjay Mehrotra told CNBC's Jim Cramer. \"It is real. It is here, and we need more and more memory to address that demand.\"Mehrotra said that Micron is spending $200 billion to build more production capacity in the U.S., including two fabs in Idaho and a 600,000-foot facility in Clay, New York, where the company broke ground on Friday. Mehrotra said it will take a few years to build out the facilities, including clean rooms and production equipment. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick attended the groundbreaking. Micron said it would invest $100 billion in that fab.He added that Micron is also working to produce more chips in its existing facilities in the near-term.At the beginning of 2025, Micron expected 10% growth for server memory, but that it ended up being \"high teens\" by the end of the year. Mehrotra also said the company saw stronger-than-expected growth in memory and storage for PCs. \"We see that tightness continuing into 2027, so we see durable industry fundamentals over the foreseeable future, driven by AI demand,\" Mehrotra said.The rush to supply the memory demand of companies like Nvidia, Advanced Micro Devices and Google has led to a shortage, and prices for the essential component are expected to rise an estimated 55% in the first quarter, CNBC previously reported.

    "body": "An Obamacare sign at a Miami insurance agency on Nov. 12, 2025.Joe Raedle | Getty ImagesThe White House on Thursday reiterated its support for sending payments directly to households to cover health-care costs, an idea President Donald Trump has championed for months. However, health policy experts reached by CNBC said they were skeptical of the proposal. \"I do think it's a bad idea,\" said Gerard Anderson, a professor of health policy and management at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.The policy was part of a broad outline of a health-care plan that the White House said would lower drug prices and insurance premiums. In a video unveiling the framework, dubbed \"The Great Healthcare Plan,\" Trump called on Congress to swiftly codify it into law.

It's hard to assess the specific impact of direct health-care payments, experts said, since the White House framework lacked key details such as who would be eligible, the amount consumers might receive and how the money could be spent. At a high level, it doesn't appear the proposal would grant the same level of financial assistance for health care that consumers currently receive, which would likely lead many to drop their insurance and cause premiums to rise for remaining enrollees, Anderson said.There would also have to be strong guardrails in place to dictate how people could spend their health-care funds, said Nick Fabrizio, a health policy expert and associate teaching professor at Cornell University's Jeb E. Brooks School of Public Policy.\"I feel very strongly that if you give people money, they will spend it on things other than health care unless it's like a voucher,\" Fabrizio said. Trump's overall framework, which calls for policies like greater price transparency in the medical ecosystem, could succeed in lowering health costs, Fabrizio said.Trump framework comes amid ACA subsidy debateSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-NY, speaks at a press conference with other members of Senate Democratic leadership following a policy luncheon at the Capitol on Oct. 15, 2025.Anadolu | Getty ImagesThe framework comes as Congress is debating whether to extend enhanced subsidies that lower insurance premiums for millions of Affordable Care Act marketplace enrollees, and it may complicate a bipartisan effort underway to renew them.Those enhanced subsidies, in place since 2021, expired at the end of last year. KFF, a nonpartisan health policy research group, estimated the lapse would cause premiums to soar more than twofold for the average recipient. Without the enhancement, a baseline of subsidies known as premium tax credits is still in place for ACA enrollees. Consumers can opt to receive those premium tax credits in one of two ways: in a lump sum during tax season, or via an immediate reduction in monthly insurance premiums. In the latter scenario, by far the most popular, the federal government sends a consumer's subsidy to their insurer, which then lowers the consumer's upfront premium. watch nowTrump's health framework called for an end to \"billions in extra taxpayer-funded subsidy payments\" and instead supported sending that money \"directly to eligible Americans to allow them to buy the health insurance of their choice.\"It's unclear how such a plan would work, experts said. Trump and some congressional Republicans had previously supported the idea of repealing some or all ACA subsidies and replacing them with contributions to health savings accounts or something similar, wrote Larry Levitt and Cynthia Cox of KFF. A health savings account is a tax-advantaged account geared to medical expenses.A White House official said Thursday that consumers outside the ACA market would also qualify for direct payments. While HSAs can be used to cover certain medical expenses, consumers can't currently use them to pay insurance premiums — and only consumers who are enrolled in a qualifying high-deductible health insurance plan can make contributions to such an account, experts said. \"You'd have hurdles getting people through the door\" and into an insurance plan if that HSA prohibition against premium payments were to remain, said Matt McGough, an Affordable Care Act policy analyst at KFF. \"It's really not going to relieve a lot of the [financial] burden for those people.\"The devil is really in the details here,\" he said. Amount is a key missing detailThe direct payment amount and the extent to which any remaining premium tax credits would be scaled back are other important, unknown details, experts said.If the amount were not large enough, then younger, healthier people would generally be the ones to drop their coverage — leaving older, sicker enrollees behind, Anderson said. Insurers would raise premiums for the remaining insured to compensate for that risk, since older, sicker enrollees generally require more care, he said. Legislation unveiled in December by Sens. Mike Crapo, R-Idaho, chair of the Senate Finance Committee, and Bill Cassidy, R-La., chair of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, would provide an annual HSA contribution of $1,000 for individuals ages 18 to 49 or $1,500 for individuals ages 50 to 64.That sum \"really pales in comparison\" to what many enrollees, especially those ages 50 to 64, had received from enhanced ACA subsidies, McGough said.For example, the average middle-income 60-year-old earning almost $63,000 a year is no longer eligible for ACA subsidies, and is on the hook for the full, unsubsidized insurance premium in 2026 — about $15,000, according to a KFF analysis. In 2025, this same individual was eligible for an ACA premium subsidy of about $7,300. Premium tax credit amounts vary greatly from person to person, based on age, income and geography. ",

The two turbines are part of a pilot program for the Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind Program.Kendall Warner | Virginian Pilot | Tribune News Service | Getty ImagesCoastal Virginia Offshore Wind will resume construction, after a federal judge Friday temporarily lifted the Trump administration's suspension of the project. It is the largest offshore wind project under construction in the U.S. Shares of Dominion Energy, the owner and developer, rose about 1% on the news.The Department of Interior in December halted construction of five wind farms off the East Coast, including Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind, claiming national security concerns. Judge Jamar Walker of the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia granted Dominion's request for a preliminary injunction Friday. Dominion called the Trump suspension \"arbitrary and illegal\" in its lawsuit. \"Our team will now focus on safely restarting work to ensure CVOW begins delivery of critical energy in just weeks,\" a Dominion spokesperson told CNBC in a statement Friday. \"While our legal challenge proceeds, we will continue seeking a durable resolution of this matter through cooperation with the federal government,\" the spokesperson said. Dominion said in December that \"stopping CVOW for any length of time will threaten grid reliability for some of the nation's most important war fighting, AI and civilian assets.\"Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind is a 176-turbine project that would provide enough power for more than 600,000 homes, according to Dominion. It is scheduled to start dispatching power by the end of the first quarter of 2026. The project will help meet power demand in in northern Virginia, the world's largest data center market. Data centers are increasingly straining the electric grid as they consume more power to train and run artificial intelligence applications. The Trump administration tried to halt four other offshore wind farms in December. They are Vineyard Wind 1 off Massachusetts; Revolution Wind off Rhode Island; Sunrise Wind off Long Island and New England; and Empire Wind 1 south of Long Island.Federal judges this week allowed Revolution Wind and Empire Wind to resume construction.

    "body": "Single-family homes in a residential neighborhood in Miramar, Florida, Oct. 27, 2022.Joe Raedle | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesA version of this article first appeared in CNBC's Inside Wealth newsletter with Robert Frank, a weekly guide to the high-net-worth investor and consumer. Sign up to receive future editions, straight to your inbox.Private investment firms of ultra-rich families could inadvertently get caught in the crosshairs of President Donald Trump's proposed ban on \"large institutional investors\" buying more single-family homes. While Trump's announcement took aim at Wall Street landlords, and particularly private equity giants like Blackstone, Haynes Boone partner Vicki Odette told Inside Wealth that family offices aren't necessarily out of the woods.Three-quarters of family offices in North America invest in real estate, with an average allocation of 18%, according to a survey issued by Campden Wealth and RBC Wealth Management last year. Residential properties made up just under a third of the average family office's real estate holdings, per the same report.The consequences of Trump's proposal hinge on how it would define a large institutional investor, which has yet to be revealed. According to Odette, in recent years, Congress and government agencies have focused on the number of homes owned rather than the investor's total assets or investment strategy. A 2024 report by the Government Accountability Office about institutional investors focused on those who own more than 1,000 properties of four units or less. The threshold is even lower in the Stop Predatory Investing Act that was introduced in March, which names \"disqualified single family property owners,\" defined as taxpayers who directly or indirectly own 50 or more single-family residential rental properties. \"There's a lot of rich families that would fall into that category inadvertently because they are real estate developers and made their money in real estate,\" said Odette, a partner at Haynes Boone who advises family offices, funds and institutional investors.Family offices generally prefer multifamily housing and commercial developments, she said. However, there are some family offices, especially in the South, that have meaningful portfolios of single-family homes in suburban or rural areas, she said.Michael Cole, managing partner of R360, an investment community for centimillionaires, said it is too early to tell if the ban will affect family offices. Muddying matters is the fact that family offices are structured in a wide variety of ways, he said.\"There is no legal entity called a family office. It's not a corporation, it's not an LLC, it's not an FLP,\" he said, referring to family-limited partnerships. \"Those are organizations that are run by the concept of a single-family office, but a single-family office is not a legal structure.\"Arielle Frost, partner in Withers' real estate practice, said family offices likely wouldn't be affected immediately, as Wall Street landlords are the primary target. What is unclear, she said, is whether politicians and legislators would continue to target other types of investors. \"The first strike is probably the most important, because you need to get the support for it and the momentum behind it,\" she said. \"Then the question becomes will it peter out? 'OK, we made our base happy, and now we move on to other things,' or is this this truly something that the administration cares about and is going to continue to focus on?\"",

    "body": "President Donald Trump gestures before boarding Air Force One en route to Detroit, Michigan, at Joint Base Andrews, Maryland, Jan. 13, 2026.Evelyn Hockstein | ReutersThe Trump administration and bipartisan state governors on Friday urged the largest electricity grid in the U.S. to make the big technology companies pay for new power plants. Electricity prices have exploded in recent years on PJM Interconnection due in part to the data centers that tech companies are building to train and power artificial intelligence. The PJM grid serves more than 65 million people across 13 states and Washington, D.C. Its service area includes northern Virginia, the largest data center market in the world. The Trump administration and the governors of Maryland, Pennsylvania, Indiana and Virginia signed an agreement that calls for tech companies to pay for new power plants built in PJM. The tech companies will fund $15 billion of new generation for the grid, according to an administration statement. They also urged PJM to hold an emergency capacity auction to procure this power, according to the Department of Energy. PJM should also cap the amount that existing power plants can charge in the grid's capacity market to protect ratepayers, they said. \"Under President Trump's leadership, the administration is leading a unprecedented bi-partisan effort urging PJM to fix the energy subtraction failures of the past, prevent price increases, and reduce the risk of blackouts,\" White House spokeswoman Taylor Rogers said.  Utility bills are rising in many parts of the U.S. despite Trump's promise to lower energy prices during his presidential campaign. The issue played a major role in the landslide victories of Democrats Mikie Sherrill and Abigail Spanberger in the governors' races of New Jersey and Virginia, respectively. The price to secure power capacity in PJM has exploded in recent years with $23 billion attributable to data centers, according to watchdog Monitoring Analytics. Those costs are passed down to consumers. This amounts to a \"massive wealth transfer,\" the watchdog told PJM in a November letter.PJM was six gigawatts short of its reliability requirement for 2027 in its most recent auction. Six gigawatts is equivalent to six large nuclear plants. The power shortage makes blackouts more likely, said Abe Silverman, a researcher at Johns Hopkins University who served as general counsel for New Jersey's public utility board from 2019 to 2023 under Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy.\"Instead of a blackout happening every one in 10 years, we're looking at something more often,\" Silverman said.",

    "body": "President Donald Trump gestures as he speaks during a \"Great, Historic Investment in Rural Health Roundtable\" in the East Room of the White House on Jan. 16, 2026.Chip Somodevilla | Getty ImagesPresident Donald Trump said Friday he may impose tariffs on countries \"if they don't go along with Greenland.\" \"We need Greenland for national security. So I may do that,\" Trump said at the White House during a health-care-related event.The comments show Trump, whose push to acquire Greenland for the U.S. has grown increasingly aggressive in recent months, turning to one of his favorite tools for leveraging power over foreign nations.The White House did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for additional information on Trump's remarks.The Trump administration has previously said it is weighing multiple options, including utilizing the U.S. military, in order to take over the Danish territory. Trump asserts it is essential that America own Greenland — even though the U.S. already maintains a military base there — because of national security concerns posed by China and Russia.The White House has also said the U.S. is considering making an offer to buy the Arctic island. But Greenland and Denmark have repeatedly insisted that the territory is not for sale and has no wish to be absorbed into America.Trump's suggestion that he may wield tariffs to get his way on Greenland came after he described a similar strategy to force foreign countries to raise their drug prices.Trump has pushed to lower the cost of U.S. drugs by mandating that domestic prices match lower ones paid overseas.At the White House event Friday, Trump said he threatened the leaders of multiple countries to either raise drug prices as part of a \"most favored nations\" deal, or else face heavy tariffs on all their imports to the U.S.\"I may do that for Greenland too. I may put a tariff on countries if they don't go along with Greenland, because we need Greenland for national security,\" Trump said.A delegation from Greenland and Denmark, after meeting with Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio in Washington on Thursday, said they have a \"fundamental disagreement\" with Trump.Trump has greatly expanded the government's use of tariffs since retaking office, raising the overall average tariff rate to an estimated 17%.Many of his broadest levies were invoked using the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, or IEEPA. The administration's use of that law has been repeatedly challenged, and multiple courts have found the actions unlawful. The dispute has been elevated to the Supreme Court, which could soon deliver its ruling on the legality of Trump's IEEPA tariffs. Trump has claimed that his agenda would unravel if the high court rules against him.\"I hope we win the Supreme Court case, because if we don't, [it'd] be a shame for our country,\" he said Friday.",

He said the U.S. needs Greenland for national security and that only Washington can counter an alleged threat from Russia and China to the island.Peskov added that Trump \"has said that international law is not a priority for him.

The White House meeting, which was described as \"frank but constructive\" by Danish Foreign Minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen, ended on Wednesday without a diplomatic breakthrough, although they agreed to keep talking via a high-level working group. In a recent interview with the New York Times, Trump said he doesn't \"need international law\" and that only his \"own morality\" and mind can stop him.

    "body": "OpenAI CEO Sam Altman visits \"Making Money With Charles Payne\" at Fox Business Network Studios in New York on Dec. 4, 2024.Mike Coppola | Getty ImagesOpenAI on Friday announced it will begin testing ads within ChatGPT in the coming weeks, a highly anticipated decision that could kickstart a lucrative new revenue stream for the artificial intelligence startup. OpenAI said its Plus, Pro and Enterprise subscriptions will not include ads, but it plans to start testing them with adult free users in the U.S. The company also made its low-cost Go offering available in the U.S. on Friday, and it said users who opt for that plan will also begin to see ads. The company inked more than $1.4 trillion worth of infrastructure deals in 2025, and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said in November that the startup was on track to generate $20 billion in annualized revenue run rate last year. Introducing ads to ChatGPT could help OpenAI meet its ambitious spending commitments, as digital advertising has long been the cash cow for other big tech companies like Google and Meta.

ChatGPT's responses will not be influenced by ads, and OpenAI said it will \"never\" sell users' data to advertisers, according to a release. Users under the age of 18 will not see ads, and ads will not appear near certain topics, including politics, health and mental health, OpenAI said. Altman has publicly expressed reservations about introducing ads to ChatGPT in recent years, stating in interviews that doing so could erode users' trust in OpenAI's products. But in a November podcast appearance, Altman said he expected OpenAI to try ads \"at some point,\" though he added that he did not believe it would be the company's biggest revenue opportunity. \"We'll learn from feedback and refine how ads show up over time, but our commitment to putting users first and maintaining trust won't change,\" OpenAI said in a statement on Friday.As OpenAI tests ads, the company said users will be able to learn more about why they're seeing a specific ads, dismiss ads and submit feedback about the experience.

    "body": "The Nave Photon, carrying crude oil from Venezuela, is docked at Port Freeport in Freeport, Texas, U.S., January 15, 2026.  Antranik Tavitian | ReutersThe U.S. is securing about 30% higher prices for Venezuelan crude, Energy Secretary Chris Wright said Thursday, as the country has started selling oil from the Latin American nation after capturing its former President Nicolas Maduro.Washington has completed its first sale of Venezuelan oil valued at about $500 million, according to a U.S. Department of Energy spokesperson, with more expected in the coming days and weeks.\"We're getting about a 30% higher realized price when we sell the same barrel of oil than they sold the same barrel of oil three weeks ago,\" Wright said at a U.S. Energy Association event, without specifying prices.U.S. special forces captured Maduro earlier this month during an operation that Washington said was aimed at restoring political stability.President Donald Trump said last week that Venezuela would hand over between 30 million and 50 million barrels of oil currently under U.S. sanctions, which would be sold at prevailing market prices. In a social media post, he noted that the proceeds would be controlled by him to ensure the funds benefit both Venezuela and the U.S.That would just be the first tranche of oil, as the Department of Energy has said the oil sales from Venezuela will continue \"indefinitely.\"Venezuela holds the world's largest proven crude reserves at about 303 billion barrels, but years of underinvestment have left its oil industry in severe decline, with output now around 800,000 barrels per day from a peak of 3.5 million bpd in the 1990s. Trump also announced last Friday that oil companies would invest at least $100 billion to rebuild Venezuela's energy sector, adding that the U.S. would provide security to ensure investors earn strong returns. He met oil industry leaders from Exxon, Chevron, ConocoPhillips, Halliburton, Valero and Maratho at the White House to discuss investments in Venezuela. Exxon CEO Darren Woods told Trump that the Venezuelan market is \"uninvestable\" in its current state.  Venezuela seized Exxon's and Conoco's assets in 2007, and Caracas owes the companies billions of dollars in outstanding claims from arbitration cases.The developments come as global oil markets face a supply overhang that has weighed on prices in the past year. Brent futures inched 0.14% higher to $63.85 a barrel as of 8:33 p.m. ET, while the U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude rose 0.2% to $59.31. This follows a sharp fall on Thursday as traders appear to brush off tensions between U.S. and Iran. \"Venezuela's oil problem is not technical, and it is not commercial,  it's fundamentally human and political,\" said Baron Lamarre, former head of trading at Petronas and co-founder of Index.\"Until investors have confidence in long-term political continuity, capital will remain cautious, incremental, and conditional,\" he said.",

    "body": "Amazon package and Saks Fifth Avenue bag.Getty ImagesAmazon wants a federal judge to reject Saks Global's bankruptcy financing plan, writing in court papers the beleaguered department store \"burned through hundreds of millions of dollars in less than a year\" and failed to hold up their agreement. When Saks acquired Neiman Marcus for $2.7 billion in December 2024, Amazon invested $475 million into the venture on the grounds the retailer would start selling its products on Amazon's website and the tech company would offer technology and logistics expertise.\"That equity investment is now presumptively worthless,\" Amazon's attorneys wrote in a Wednesday filing, hours after Saks filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. \"Saks continuously failed to meet its budgets, burned through hundreds of millions of dollars in less than a year, and ran up additional hundreds of millions of dollars in unpaid invoices owed to its retail partners.\"As part of the deal, Saks launched a branded \"Saks at Amazon\" storefront on the e-commerce company's website featuring a range of luxury fashion and beauty items. It also agreed to pay a referral fee for Saks-branded goods sold on the platform, guaranteeing at least $900 million in payments to Amazon over eight years. In its filing, Amazon argued that Saks' bankruptcy financing plan harms the company, and other creditors, because it saddles parts of the Saks corporation with new debt that it previously didn't have. It also pushes Amazon further down the pecking order in terms of repayment, which reduces the amount it could potentially be repaid during the proceedings, the e-commerce company said in the filings. Amazon wrote that it \"hopes\" Saks will resolve its concerns, but if it doesn't, it may \"seek more drastic remedies\" including the appointment of an examiner or a trustee. During a hearing Wednesday in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Houston, Judge Alfredo Perez allowed Saks to start tapping into $1.75 billion in new bankruptcy financing after the company argued it would face immediate liquidation without it. He has yet to issue a ruling on Amazon's request. Saks' acquisition of Neiman Marcus brought a slew of new investors, including names from the technology industry. For Amazon, the deal guaranteed Saks' presence on its sprawling webstore, where the company has sought to attract bigger brands and grow its luxury selection, in particular. The Saks deal also raised the possibility that Amazon could deepen its investment in the department store chain. Amazon has been determined to have a bigger presence in physical retail and it's experimented with several concepts over the years, scrapping some along the way.The company has also struck similar investment agreements in the past. In 2022, Amazon took a 2% stake in Grubhub in exchange for the food delivery company adding perks for Prime members. Amazon expanded its stake in the company to up to 18% in 2024.Amazon and Saks both declined to comment beyond what they stated in filings.Software giant Salesforce also became a minority shareholder in Saks during its acquisition of Neiman Marcus, but it took a smaller stake than Amazon did. It's unclear if it also plans to object to the bankruptcy plan. Correction: An earlier headline on this article incorrectly quoted the Amazon filing. watch now",

    "body": "If you want to raise successful, resilient kids, help them find activities they actually like, says psychologist Angela Duckworth.Instead of forcing your children to try a specific sport or instrument, spend time exposing them to a variety of extracurriculars and take note of what they spend the most time thinking about, Duckworth said on an Oct. 13 episode of \"The Mel Robbins Podcast.\"Guiding kids to activities they're interested in can help them find their passions, hobbies and maybe even their future careers, said Duckworth, a psychology professor at the University of Pennsylvania who researches mental and emotional \"grit.\"\"I think great parenting, a lot of it is noticing what your young people is thinking about,\" Duckworth said, adding: \"When we begin to notice where our mind lives, when we begin to notice what attracts our attention spontaneously, that is the beginning of discovering the interests that can make us something of a genius about what we do.\"DON'T MISS: The ultimate guide to using AI to communicate betterKids who learn to stick with their interests, even on difficult days, can develop their confidence and resilience — two traits that can help them find success later in life, said Duckworth. Your child might pick a sport or hobby and then decide they don't like it, but it's important for them to finish that athletic season, or keep rehearsing that musical instrument just through their next concert, she added.Duckworth referenced her own experience as a parent. Her child Lucy \"hated doing homework and practicing her viola,\" but when Duckworth looked at Lucy's iPad, she noticed that \"all of the tabs were open to baking videos,\" she said. Duckworth also saw Lucy reading their family's cookbooks, she noted.Lucy ended up \"volunteering in restaurants washing dishes, [then] was allowed to assist the pastry chef,\" Duckworth tells CNBC Make It. \"She was doing pastry literally every weekend and every summer all the way from 8th grade to, I guess, 12th grade ... Her lifelong interest in food and cooking is still evident.\"Not every interest has to become a full-fledged career. If you just follow what you like to do, you might not necessarily make much money, bestselling author and New York University marketing professor Scott Galloway told CNBC Make It in 2019.\"Don't follow your passion,\" Galloway said. His advice instead: \"Find out what you're good at and then invest 10,000 hours in it — and become great at it.\"For Duckworth, interest is just one of four building blocks on the path to building grit, which her research shows is the most common characteristic among successful people in any field. The others include hard work, purpose and hope.\"Anybody who becomes great at what they do, there is a curiosity there, right? Their mind comes to this subject and wants to stay there,\" Duckworth said. \"When you start talking about something that you really care about, you're a genius [on it], because that is where your mind lives.\"Want to level up your AI skills? Sign up for Smarter by CNBC Make It's new online course, How To Use AI To Communicate Better At Work.

    "body": "Ask anyone what they think keeps a relationship strong, and they will probably tell you it's love. There's some truth to that: love is what draws us together in the first place.But after years of studying couples as a psychologist, and as a husband, I've realized something that research keeps confirming: The real factor that keeps couples together, long after the honeymoon phase fades, is compromise.Love alone isn't enoughPsychologists define love as an emotion. And like all emotions, love fluctuates with stress, sleep, health, and the thousand of other factors that shape our daily lives.So you can love your partner deeply and still get annoyed, frustrated, or angry with them. Love won't shield you from conflict, nor will it solve your disagreements.That's why even the happiest couples argue and have rough patches, regardless of how much love they have for each other. The difference is that strong couples know love can't fix everything — but compromise can.The psychology of compromiseCompromise happens when you balance what you want, what your partner wants, and what's best for the relationship itself.Every couple brings together a set of habits, values, and experiences. Expecting perfect alignment is unrealistic. Instead, healthy couples learn to negotiate their reality. They turn \"my way\" and \"your way\" into \"our way.\"But compromise only works when it's rooted in a strong sense of we.Research shows that couples who describe their conflicts using \"we\" language (we decided, we talked, we figured it out) feel more connected and satisfied after disagreements. When both partners see compromise as a shared effort, not a loss, it strengthens the bond between them.What compromise looks like in real lifeCompromise doesn't always look romantic. Sometimes it means agreeing to watch a movie you'd never choose yourself. Other times, it means listening to your partner vent about something while resisting your desperate urge to offer solutions.In my own marriage, I've learned that a relationship rarely demands massive sacrifices. Instead, you'll be presented with the choice of whether or not you're willing to meet your partner halfway.Today, it might be who takes on which chores. Tomorrow, it might be about how you spend your evening together. Next month, it might be about how you navigate your family holidays. It might involve finding middle ground, taking turns, or agreeing to something else that neither of you had considered. What matters is that you're both heard and respected, and that no one feels that they have to \"win\" or \"be right.\" When you consistently make enough space for one another's needs, you'll build something that love alone rarely does: reliability.

    "body": "The earlier you invest, the more time your money has to grow. But figuring out the exact accounts to use can feel overwhelming.After setting aside money to cover daily expenses in a checking account and three to 12 months of expenses in a savings account, you should start looking into putting any additional income into three different investment \"buckets,\" says Jaime Bosse, a certified financial planner and senior advisor at CGN Advisors in Manhattan, Kansas.\"If you have too much in cash, you're actually losing money to inflation,\" Bosse says. \"Any extra dollars you have should be invested in growing for the future.\"With three investment accounts, you'll have more flexibility to tap your money when you need it and more control over your tax bill now and later because each \"bucket\" offers different benefits, Bosse says. How to best allocate your money across the different types of accounts will vary based on your income and situation, she says, but the bottom line is you should be using them to your advantage. Be sure to speak with a trusted financial professional for individualized advice.Here are the three buckets she suggests and how they work.1. Tax-deferred bucketExamples: Traditional IRA, 401(k), 403(b)Tax-deferred accounts, like a traditional 401(k) or individual retirement account, let you contribute pre-tax money from your paycheck into an investment account. This lowers your taxable income for the year you contributed, and your investments grow tax-deferred until retirement.Withdrawals are taxed as income and usually penalty-free starting at age 59½. Taking money out earlier may trigger taxes and a 10% early withdrawal penalty.2. Tax-free bucketExamples: Roth IRA, Roth 401(k), Roth 403(b)You contribute money you've already paid taxes on to Roth accounts. Your investments then grow tax-free, and once you reach 59½, qualified withdrawals aren't taxed or penalized. Roth IRAs, in particular, also add flexibility by allowing you to withdraw money you've contributed at any time without penalty.These accounts are ideal if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in the future or want tax-free income later on, Bosse says.3. Taxable bucketExample: brokerage accountsTaxable brokerage accounts let you invest money after taxes and withdraw at any time without penalty. While you'll generally owe taxes on any realized gains, these accounts offer maximum flexibility for expenses outside of retirement, like a down payment on a house or a vacation, because you can access your money whenever you need it, Bosse says.Start by taking advantage of your company matchYou don't have to open all three accounts at once, says Patrick Huey, certified financial planner and owner of Victory Independent Planning in Portland, Oregon.Start by checking to see if your employer has a company match program where they will contribute an additional amount to your retirement accounts that matches your own contributions.Early in your career, Huey suggests contributing to a Roth 401(k) or Roth 403(b) instead of a tax-deferred 401(k) because you'll likely earn a higher salary as you get older — making it smarter to pay taxes now when you're in a lower tax bracket.However, even if it is through a tax-deferred account, \"if there's a match available, you should do what it takes to get it,\" because it's free money from your employer that boosts your retirement savings, Huey says.Using all three investment 'buckets' gives you optionsGenerally, experts recommend saving around 15% of your annual income before taxes for retirement, including any company match.Bosse says the purpose of splitting your money into three accounts is to give yourself options, whether it's to make big purchases, lower your current tax bill or reduce what you'll owe in the future.\"I would think of it in terms of not investing for your retirement, but investing for your future flexibility,\" Bosse says. When you have money in your three buckets, \"You can be working because you want to, not because you need to. You can travel the world. You can do other things.\"Want to level up your AI skills? Sign up for Smarter by CNBC Make It's new online course, How To Use AI To Communicate Better At Work.

    "body": "Job seekers wait to enter the SacJobs Career job fair in Sacramento, California, US, on Thursday, Nov. 13, 2025. David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesThe first economic data report that went unreleased due to the government shutdown will be released next week, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said Friday.As the U.S. government reopens for business, Wall Street's attention now turns toward when critical data on employment, inflation and other economic signposts will be released.The first such report, on September nonfarm payrolls, will come out Thursday at 8:30 a.m., according to a BLS update posted on its website.A day later, the BLS will release real earnings, a companion report to the monthly consumer price index that did not come out simultaneously in October because average earnings earnings, which are part of the payrolls report, were not released. Real earnings are the difference between the monthly CPI reading and the average hourly earnings.In fact, September CPI was the only official data point released during the shutdown due to its role in computing the cost of living adjustment for Social Security benefits.Economists expect that the \"employment situation\" report, as it is known, to include just the nonfarm payrolls count and not the unemployment rate.That's because the report entails two surveys: a more objective look at \"hard data\" from businesses that uses timecards and payroll numbers to assess how many jobs have been filled, and another entailing telephone calls and written surveys to households asking how many people are working. The latter survey is used to calculate the jobless rate and would be difficult to replicate.The Commerce Department, including the Bureau of Economic Analysis, had not posted revised schedules as of Friday morning, but updates are expected soon.Uncertainty on other releases casts another cloud over what has become an increasingly contentious policymaking atmosphere at the Federal Reserve — not to mention the nervous climate among investors.\"The absence of timely official numbers left the markets and the Fed operating in a data fog, forced to scour alternate sources to gauge the underlying outlook,\" Bank of America economist Shruti Mishra said in a note. \"With the shutdown resolved, all eyes will now be on the incoming data dump.\"The shutdown not only halted data collection and releases, but it also complicated the picture once the data does start coming out.watch nowFor instance, the October CPI report may never be compiled, owing also to the method used to gather data. The Bureau of Labor Statistics uses in-person visits, so the data can't be collected retroactively. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt warned Wednesday about missing data, but Mishra said she wasn't expecting the CPI report even before that.A statement on the BLS site asks for patience during the data collection process as \"it may take time to fully assess the situation and finalize revised release dates.\" Similarly, the BEA, which releases several key data points including the Fed's inflation gauge, said it is working with the BLS and other agencies on data collection and \"will publish updated release dates as soon as they are available.\"Political pressureIn the meantime, some Democratic lawmakers already are getting impatient and demanding answers from the administration about when the data will be released.Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Bernie Sanders of Vermont, Maria Cantwell of Washington and Gary Peters of Michigan insisted that \"government shutdowns do not inherently inhibit the federal government from collecting or releasing economic data,\" according to a letter obtained by CNBC.comCiting precedent from the October 2013 shutdown, in which the BLS later published release dates, the administration \"may be intentionally restricting the release of data.\"\"The Trump Administration's failure to release data or provide a clear schedule for the release of delayed data leaves businesses and policymakers without access to critical economic information,\" the letter states. \"It is critical that businesses, consumers, workers, Congress, and the Fed have access to timely and comprehensive economic data. The Administration must release as much economic data as possible before the Fed's meeting and resume normally scheduled data releases as soon as possible.\"White House officials did not respond to a request for comment.Waiting for the FedSince Leavitt's statement Wednesday, several officials did say data would be forthcoming but there are still questions on which reports will come out when. Labor Secretary Lori Chavez-DeRemer said data on payrolls and prices will have to be assessed for accuracy before it can be released.\"I'm not sure when BLS, if and when they will be able to release that, but I'm expecting they will tell us a schedule very quickly about when those numbers could come out,\" Chavez-DeRemer said Friday on Fox Business. Chavez added that the White House has been \"urging for accurate data to come out for November.\"Citigroup economist Andrew Hollenhorst said in a Friday note that he is optimistic the Fed will have the September, October and November jobs reports by the time it holds its next policy meeting on Dec. 9-10. Fed officials in September indicated that a December cut would be likely, but several key officials have said recently that they are suspect of the need for additional easing.Outside of the payrolls and CPI report, the BLS also computes data on import and export prices, job openings, producer prices, productivity and other metrics. The Labor Department itself releases the weekly jobless claims numbers.Beyond the BLS and Labor Department issues, the Commerce Department also handles several key data points.Among them are personal income and spending, which includes the Fed's main inflation forecasting measure, the personal consumption expenditures price index, and gross domestic product. Data for October PCE is scheduled to be released Nov. 26. The Census Bureau handles retail sales, trade balance and durable good releases. Department officials did not respond to a request for comment.",

    "body": "An exterior view of the new JPMorgan Chase global headquarters building at 270 Park Avenue on Nov. 13, 2025 in New York City. Angela Weiss | AFP | Getty ImagesJPMorgan Chase has secured deals ensuring it will get paid by the fintech firms responsible for nearly all the data requests made by third-party apps connected to customer bank accounts, CNBC has learned.The bank has signed updated contracts with the fintech middlemen that make up more than 95% of the data pulls on its systems, including Plaid, Yodlee, Morningstar and Akoya, according to JPMorgan spokesman Drew Pusateri.\"We've come to agreements that will make the open banking ecosystem safer and more sustainable and allow customers to continue reliably and securely accessing their favorite financial products,\" Pusateri said in a statement. \"The free market worked.\"The milestone is the latest twist in a long-running dispute between traditional banks and the fintech industry over access to customer accounts. For years, middlemen like Plaid paid nothing to tap bank systems when a customer wanted to use a fintech app like Robinhood to draw funds or check balances.That dynamic appeared to be enshrined in law in late 2024, when the Biden-era Consumer Financial Protection Bureau finalized what is known as the \"open-banking rule\" requiring banks to share customer data with other financial firms at no cost.But banks sued to prevent the CFPB rule from taking hold and seemed to gain the upper hand in May after the Trump administration asked a federal court to vacate the rule.Soon after, JPMorgan — the largest U.S. bank by assets, deposits and branches — reportedly told the middlemen that it would start charging what amounts to hundreds of millions of dollars for access to its customer data.In response, fintech, crypto and venture capital executives argued that the bank was engaging in \"anti-competitive, rent-seeking behavior\" that would hurt innovation and consumers' ability to use popular apps.After weeks of negotiations between JPMorgan and the middlemen, the bank agreed to lower pricing than it originally proposed, and the fintech middlemen won concessions regarding the servicing of data requests, according to people with knowledge of the talks.Fintech firms preferred the certainty of locking in data-sharing rates because it is unclear whether the current CFPB, which is in the process of revising the open-banking rule, will favor banks or fintech companies, according to a venture capital investor who asked for anonymity to discuss his portfolio companies.The bank and the fintech firms declined to disclose details about their contracts, including how much the middlemen agreed to pay and how long the deals are in force.Wider impactThe deals mark a shift in the power dynamic between banks, middlemen and the fintech apps that are increasingly threatening incumbents. More banks are likely to begin charging fintech firms for access to their systems, according to industry observers.  \"JPMorgan tends to be a trendsetter. They're sort of the leader of the pack, so it's fair to expect that the rest of the major banks will follow,\" said Brian Shearer, director of competition and regulatory policy at the Vanderbilt Policy Accelerator.Shearer, who worked at the CFPB under former director Rohit Chopra, said he's worried that the development would create a barrier of entry to nascent startups and ultimately result in higher costs for consumers.Source: RobinhoodProponents of the 2024 CFPB rule said it gave consumers control over their financial data and encouraged competition and innovation. Banks including JPMorgan said it exposed them to fraud and unfairly saddled them with the rising costs of maintaining systems increasingly tapped by the middlemen and their clients.  When Plaid's deal with JPMorgan was announced in September, the companies issued a dual press release emphasizing the continuity it provided for customers.But the industry group that Plaid is a part of has harshly criticized the development, signaling that while JPMorgan has won a decisive battle, the ongoing skirmish may yet play out in courts and in the public.\"Introducing prohibitive tolls is anti-competitive, anti-innovation, and flies in the face of the plain reading of the law,\" Penny Lee, CEO of the Financial Technology Association, told CNBC in response to the JPMorgan milestone.\"These agreements are not the free market at work, but rather big banks using their market position to capitalize on regulatory uncertainty,\" Lee said. \"We urge the Trump Administration to uphold the law by maintaining the existing prohibition on data access fees.\"",

Across nine of the 12 calendar years when McMillon has been Walmart's leader, the company posted positive stock returns.Among Walmart's main rivals in the retail and grocery business, only Amazon and Costco have had better stock returns since McMillon took the job. Meanwhile, Walmart's stock has outperformed those of competitors like Target, Dollar General, Dollar Tree, Kroger and Albertsons.McMillon will officially step down at the end of January, but will stay on as executive chairman and advisor. While Furner will face a challenge in replicating the company's performance under his predecessor, he has been a key catalyst for the company's success as CEO of its largest sector, Walmart's U.S. business.Along with huge gains on Wall Street, McMillon oversaw a significant period of growth for the nation's largest grocer, which included sharp sales increases, wage hikes for hourly workers and transformation of the nation's low-price leader into a major e-commerce player. He also steered the retailer through the tumult of a global pandemic, historic levels of inflation and higher tariffs.Sales during McMillon's first three years in the role were roughly flat — with revenues of $486 billion, $482 billion and $485 billion in the fiscal years ending January 2015, 2016 and 2017, respectively.Yet those years were followed by steady growth, and those gains have accelerated since 2021, after the Covid pandemic pushed more people to shop online and inflation nudged even wealthier shoppers to seek value. Walmart posted annual revenue of about $681 billion in the fiscal year ended earlier this year, an approximately 40% jump from the company's annual revenue the first year of McMillon's tenure.This year, Walmart is on track to post annual revenues of over $700 billion for the first time ever. Ironically, however, it is also expected to lose its crown as the largest retailer by annual revenue to its biggest e-commerce rival, Amazon.Earlier this year, Amazon leapfrogged Walmart in quarterly sales for the first time. Compared to Walmart, it has a different mix to its business because of its massive cloud computing, advertising and seller services businesses.How Walmart's stock compares to its rivalsStock gains by Amazon have outpaced Walmart's during the years of McMillon's tenure, with 1,225% share gains by the tech giant compared to a 312% increase by Walmart.However, Walmart's performance on Wall Street has far surpassed big-box retail competitor Target's across McMillon's time as CEO. Shares of Target are up about 60% since February 2014, compared to Walmart's 312% gains.During the years of the Covid pandemic, Target's steep share gains surpassed those of Walmart. Yet the Minneapolis-based cheap chic retailer's annual sales have been roughly stagnant for about four years and dragged down its stock performance.Like Walmart, Target is preparing for a leadership change in February. Last month, Target said Michael Fiddelke, its chief operating officer and former CFO, would succeed longtime CEO Brian Cornell.Costco also stands out as a competitor that has posted steeper share gains than Walmart. Shares of the warehouse club retailer, which competes with both Walmart stores and those of its warehouse chain, Sam's Club, have shot up by more than 700% during the years of McMillon's tenure.Walmart's supermarket competitors — Kroger and Albertsons, in particular — have lagged behind that. Shares of Kroger, which includes about two dozen grocery chains including Fred Meyer and Ralphs, climbed 265% during McMillon's tenure. Shares of Albertsons, which includes Safeway, Tom Thumb and other grocery chains, rose by only 16%.Albertsons went public in 2020, which gave it less time for stock gains. For about two of those years, from roughly 2022 to 2024, Kroger and Albertsons also sought to merge their two companies into a larger grocer that could better compete with Walmart, Costco, Amazon and others. The deal was ultimately blocked by a U.S. judge, after the Federal Trade Commission sued to stop the merger.Dollar stores also fell short of Walmart's stock performance while McMillon was CEO. Dollar Tree and Dollar General, who compete with Walmart in offering groceries and other items at low prices, posted 104% and 85% share gains, respectively, compared to Walmart's 312% increase.Notably, both dollar store banners' stocks outperformed Walmart's during some of those years, yet have been struggling more recently.Walmart's stock was about flat Friday following the retirement announcement, and shares have climbed about 13% this year.— CNBC's Tom Rotunno contributed to this report.",

    "body": "Nikolas Kokovlis | Nurphoto | Getty ImagesAlphabet and Disney on Friday announced that they've reached a deal to restore content from ABC and ESPN onto Google's YouTube TV.The deal comes after a two-week standoff between the two companies that started on Oct. 31. The stalemate resulted in numerous live sporting events, including college football games and two Monday Night Football games, being absent from the popular streaming service.\"We're happy to share that we've reached an agreement with Disney that preserves the value of our service for our subscribers and future flexibility in our offers,\" YouTube said in a statement. \"Subscribers should see channels including ABC, ESPN and FX returning to their service over the course of the day, as well as any recordings that were previously in their Library. We apologize for the disruption and appreciate our subscribers' patience as we negotiated on their behalf.\"Disney Entertainment's co-chairs Alan Bergman and Dana Walden, along with ESPN Chairman Jimmy Pitaro, said in a statement that said the agreement reflects \"how audiences choose to watch\" entertainment.\"We are pleased that our networks have been restored in time for fans to enjoy the many great programming options this weekend, including college football,\" they said.More than 20 Disney-owned channels were removed from YouTube TV, which offered its subscribers $20 credits this week due to the dispute. In addition to ABC and ESPN, other networks that were unavailable included FX, NatGeo, Disney Channel and Freeform. The main sticking point between the two companies was the rate Disney charges YouTube TV for its networks. Disney's most valuable channel, ESPN, charges carriage of more than $10 a month per pay-TV subscriber, a higher fee than any other network in the U.S., CNBC previously reported.It's not the first conflict this year between YouTube and legacy media.NBCUniversal content was nearly removed from YouTube TV before the companies reached an agreement in October, preventing shows like \"Sunday Night Football\" and \"America's Got Talent\" from being pulled.YouTube TV also found itself in a standoff with Fox in August that almost resulted in Fox News, Fox Sports and other Fox channels going dark on the service just before the start of the college football season. The two sides were able to strike a deal to prevent a blackout.YouTube said it has the option for future program packages with Disney and other partners.Disney said that access to a selection of live and on-demand programming from ESPN Unlimited, which includes content from ESPN+ and new content on its all-inclusive digital service coming later this year, will be available on YouTube TV to base plan subscribers at no additional cost by the end of 2026.Here's the memo that Disney executives sent to employees:Team,We're pleased to share that we've reached a new agreement with YouTube TV, and all of our stations and networks are in the process of being restored to the service.While this was a challenging moment, it ultimately led to a strong outcome for both consumers and for our company, with a deal that recognizes the tremendous value of the high-quality entertainment, sports, and news that fans have come to expect from Disney.Over the past few years, we've led the way in creating innovative deals with key partners –each one unique, and each designed to recognize the full value of our programming. This new agreement reflects that same creativity and commitment to doing what's best for both our audiences and our business.We're proud of the work that went into this deal and grateful to everyone who helped make it happen — especially Sean Breen, Jimmy Zasowski, and the Platform Distribution team for their tireless commitment throughout this process.Thank you all for your patience and professionalism over the past several weeks. As you all know, the media landscape continues to evolve quickly, which makes these types of negotiations complex. What hasn't changed is our focus on the viewer. Our priority is — and will always be — delivering the best experiences and the best value to fans, and we'll continue working closely with our partners to ensure we're fulfilling that mission for our audiences.We're incredibly optimistic about what's ahead and grateful to all of you for continuing to set the standard for entertainment around the world.Alan, Dana & JimmyDisclosure: Comcast is the parent company of NBCUniversal, which owns CNBC.

    "body": "U.S. President Donald Trump gestures during an announcement from the State Dining Room at the White House in Washington, D.C., U.S., Oct. 23, 2025.Jonathan Ernst | ReutersPresident Donald Trump on Friday exempted key agricultural imports like coffee, cocoa, bananas and certain beef products from his higher tariff rates.The move comes as Trump faces political blowback for high prices at U.S. grocery stores. Some distributors of beef, coffee, chocolate and other common food items have raised prices as Trump's tariffs took hold this year, adding to pressure on household budgets created by decades-high inflation in recent years.Trump's action Friday also exempts a range of fruits including tomatoes, avocados, coconuts, oranges and pineapples. Along with coffee, the tariff reductions extend to black and green tea, and spices like cinnamon and nutmeg.The move marks a reversal for Trump, who has insisted tariffs are necessary to protect U.S. businesses and workers. He has contended U.S. consumers will not ultimately pay for the higher duties.The exemptions come just a day after Trump reached trade framework agreements with four Latin American countries – including 10% tariffs on most goods from Argentina, Guatemala, and El Salvador, and 15% from Ecuador. It also removes duties specifically on products not grown or produced in the U.S. in sufficient quantities, like bananas and coffee.Rising food prices have hampered U.S. households for several years. Consumer Price Index data show food-at-home prices increased approximately 2.7% year-over-year in September. (More recent data was delayed because of the government shutdown).The tariff exemptions aim to help moderate these grocery price increases, although experts caution that other factors such as global supply shortages also influence prices, especially for coffee and beef.Here's more background on how industries like beef, coffee and cocoa have reacted to tariffs and rising prices.BeefA customer shops for meat at a Costco store on Nov. 11, 2025 in Novato, California. Justin Sullivan | Getty ImagesThe tariff exemption for beef comes after months of rising prices tied in part to Trump's own tariff policy.Over the past year, the U.S. imposed steep duties on major suppliers including Brazil, Australia, New Zealand and Uruguay. Brazil – the world's second-largest beef producer – has faced effective tariff rates topping 75%, driving down imports into the U.S. just as the cattle herd in the country hit a near 75-year low.Ranchers have struggled to rebuild herds amid drought, higher feed costs and tariffs on fertilizer, steel and aluminum that have made equipment and repairs more expensive.The supply squeeze has fueled a spike in prices at the grocery store: uncooked beef products rose 12% to 18% year over year in September, according to the most recent consumer price index report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.Producers told CNBC earlier this month that policy whiplash, from changing tariff rates to the recent expansion of Argentina's beef quota, has further chilled long-term investment, keeping supplies tight and sentiment fragile.CoffeeCoffee beans are displayed at a grocery store on Nov. 13, 2025 in San Anselmo, California.Justin Sullivan | Getty ImagesGround roast coffee prices in the U.S. reached $8.41 per pound in July, a record high and a 33% increase from the prior year, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data.Trump's 50% tariff on Brazilian coffee –  which supplies roughly a third of U.S. imports – drove up costs across the roasting and retail supply chains. Vietnam, Colombia and other major exporters have also been swept up in the administration's food tariffs.Roasters and cafés say they have no way around the duties because the U.S. produces none of the beans it consumes, leaving importers exposed to higher costs regardless of origin. The September CPI report found that coffee prices climbed nearly 21% in August from the prior year. That was the largest jump since the 1990s.Retailers have warned the impact could have spread if tariffs stayed in place. The Tax Foundation estimated in August that 74% of U.S. food imports faced tariffs, already hitting tea, spices and other products that, like coffee, have no domestic supply chain.Many of those products that have little or no U.S. production were on the list of items Trump exempted from higher tariffs Friday.Global coffee prices are hovering near a 50-year high reached in February.CocoaCocoa has faced similar price pressures.Even after a sharp selloff this fall, futures are still more than double pre-pandemic levels, costing roughly $5,300 today, following tariffs and three years of weather-driven crop failures in the Ivory Coast and Ghana.In October, Hershey executives said they expected $160 million to $170 million in tariff expenses this year, on top of record-high bean costs that pushed retail chocolate prices nearly 30% higher from the prior year heading into Halloween, according to research firm Circana.",

The segment has numerous tailwinds including a steady shift into silicone hydrogel 1-day lenses (about 40% of consumers are still using non-daily lenses), global growth in contact users, and high barriers to entry for competitors. As such, this is a great business that generates EBITDA margins in the mid-30s.CooperSurgical (33% of revenue) is focused on women's health services, with 60% of its fiscal year 2024 revenue derived from office and surgical (Paragard IUDs, stem cell cryostorage, medical devices) and 40% from fertility (IVF consumables, equipment, genomic and donor services). Fertility treatment is a $2 billion global market, also expected to grow at a 4% to 6% pace annually.For most of its history, Cooper was a pureplay vision business, until they added CooperSurgical in the 90s. Initially, this was a small – arguably tax-motivated – add-on. However, the company began heavily investing in this segment in 2017 – spending over $3 billion on the segment since.The problem with this shift is pretty clear – Cooper is effectively siphoning off cash from a really good contact lens business and then reinvesting it in what most people would judge to be a less attractive business. This is evident in the company's declining returns on capital, with CooperSurgical now operating at lower margins than they did in 2017 despite these massive investments.A key factor behind this operational shift may be management changes. The company's CEO Albert White, who previously led CooperSurgical, assumed leadership shortly after this expansion began. This raises a larger question about the company's strategic focus, leading many to question why the leader of this company would not have expertise in its core business.These strategic missteps have been further compounded by near-term headwinds across both segments, some self-inflicted. For CooperVision, the company mismanaged market expectations for the rollout of its new daily lens product, MyDay Energys, which is now behind schedule.For CooperSurgical, its highest quality business, IVF, has slowed meaningfully, likely attributable to comments from President Donald Trump suggesting potential reimbursements for IVF costs, causing patients to delay treatment in anticipation of this potential coverage. As a result, top-line organic growth fell meaningfully below expectations to 2%, down from 7% the prior quarter, forcing Cooper to significantly lower its full-year guidance at its third-quarter earnings call, sending the company's share price down 12.85% the following day. Now, Cooper is trading at a 12-month forward P/E of 16.4x — a steep discount to its 10-year average of 23.1x.All of this has prompted Jana Partners to announce a top portfolio position in Cooper and plans to push for strategic alternatives, including a potential transaction to combine its contact lens unit with peers such as Bausch + Lomb. While a transaction of this nature would typically raise some antitrust concerns, this may actually be the opposite case here.First, a merger would not result in a market leader, as the combined market share of 36% would be just below market leader J&J's share of 37% and not too far ahead of Alcon's 26% share.Secondly, these businesses are highly complementary with minimal geographical and product overlap, suggesting a reduction in the likelihood of regulatory hurdles. Notably, Bausch + Lomb has not been shy about their potential interest and also sees no regulatory issues, as CEO Brent Saunders has publicly stated that a potential combination with Cooper would \"strengthen competition and create a more scaled company in the contact lens segment.\"But Bausch + Lomb is not the only potential acquirer. Companies like European eyewear manufacturer EssilorLuxottica could also have interest and with even less regulatory uncertainty.As for CooperSurgical, there would certainly be private equity interest, as evidenced by Blackstone and TPG nearing a deal to acquire peer Hologic. However, Cooper shareholders may realize more value from the company cleaning up this portfolio internally – focusing more on the higher-multiple IVF business, shedding certain non-core assets, and potentially putting in new operators to execute a strong turnaround.Overall, with short-term headwinds likely to ease, Cooper has multiple avenues to recover its discount and open itself up for a potential rerating. Jana's thesis is straightforward: these two businesses make no sense under the same roof and a strategic combination for the vision business could yield $300 million to 500 million synergies, which is a lot for a business with $850 million in EBITDA. But step one in their plan is convincing management that separating the two businesses is the right strategic move; and despite growing public attention, there is no guarantee that management, especially with this type of operating history, will agree.Should management resist, this campaign changes dramatically from a strategic thesis to a leadership/governance thesis, likely centered on appointing a new CEO with a deep background in the contact lens industry to refocus the company on its core, while still positioning it for a separation down the line.Jana is not outwardly calling for a management change and White may even be the best person to lead a standalone CooperSurgical business. But activism is about the power of the argument and Jana seems to make a persuasive one here. Let's hope for all involved that management sees it that way.Ken Squire is the founder and president of 13D Monitor, an institutional research service on shareholder activism, and the founder and portfolio manager of the 13D Activist Fund, a mutual fund that invests in a portfolio of activist investments.",

Washington Convention Center on Oct. 28, 2025 in Washington, DC.Anna Moneymaker | Getty Images As a handful of the world's most valuable companies set out to spend $1 trillion over the next five years on data centers for artificial intelligence, one line item is on the minds of executives and investors: depreciation.In accounting, depreciation is the act of allocating the cost of a hard asset over the course of its expected useful life. It's an increasingly important concept in the tech industry, as companies predict how long the hundreds of thousands of Nvidia graphics processing units, or GPUs, they're purchasing will remain useful or retain their value.Infrastructure giants like Google, Oracle and Microsoft have said their servers could be useful for up to six years. But they could also depreciate much sooner. Microsoft said in its latest annual filing that its computer equipment lasts two to six years.That's a lot to consider for the investors and lenders financing the giant AI buildouts, because the longer equipment remains valuable, the more years a company can stretch out depreciation and the less it hurts profits.Read more CNBC reporting on AIThis Meta alum has spent 10 months leading OpenAI's nationwide hunt for its Stargate data centersAI Sam Altman and the Sora copyright gamble: 'I hope Nintendo doesn't sue us'Anthropic launches Claude Sonnet 4.5, its latest AI model that's 'more of a colleague'Sam Altman on worries about OpenAI’s $850 billion in planned buildouts: ‘I totally get that’AI GPUs represent a particular challenge because they're still relatively new to the market. Nvidia's first AI-focused processors for data centers came out around 2018. The current AI boom started with the launch of ChatGPT in late 2022. Since then, Nvidia's annual data center revenue has jumped from $15 billion to $115 billion in the fiscal year that ended in January.There's no real track record for how long GPUs last when compared with other types of heavy equipment that businesses have been using for decades, said Haim Zaltzman, vice chair of Latham & Watkins' emerging companies and growth practice.\"Is it three years, is it five, or is it seven?\" said Zaltzman, who works on GPU financings, in an interview. \"It's a huge difference in terms of how successful it is for financing purposes.\"Some of Nvidia's customers say AI chips will retain value for a long time and that customers will continue to pay for access to older processors because they'll still be useful for other tasks. CoreWeave, which buys GPUs and rents them out to clients, has used six-year depreciation cycles for its infrastructure since 2023.CoreWeave CEO Michael Intrator told CNBC this week, following quarterly earnings, that his company is being \"data driven\" about GPU shelf life.Intrator said that CoreWeave's Nvidia A100 chips, which were announced in 2020, are all fully booked. He also added that a batch of Nvidia H100 chips from 2022 became available because a contract expired, and they were immediately booked at 95% of their original price.\"All of the data points that I'm getting are telling me that the infrastructure retains value,\" Intrator said.CoreWeave CEO, Michael Intrator appears on CNBC on July 17, 2024. CNBCStill, CoreWeave shares plunged 16% after its earnings report as delays at a third-party data center developer hit full-year guidance. The stock is down 57% from its high reached in June, part of a broader sell-off reflecting concerns about overspending in AI. Oracle shares have plummeted 34% from their record high in September.Among the most vocal skeptics of the AI trade is short seller Michael Burry, who recently disclosed bets against Nvidia and Palantir.Burry this week suggested that companies including Meta, Oracle, Microsoft, Google and Amazon are overstating the useful life of their AI chips and understating depreciation. He pegs the actual useful life of server equipment at around two to three years, and said companies are inflating their earnings as a result.Amazon and Microsoft declined to comment. Meta, Google and Oracle did not respond to requests for comment.'You couldn't give Hoppers away'There are a number of ways AI chips could depreciate before six years. They could wear out and break, or they could become obsolete as newer GPUs are released. They could still be useful for running certain workloads, but with much worse economics.Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has implied as much. When Nvidia announced a new Blackwell chip earlier this year, he joked that the value of its predecessor, the Hopper, would deteriorate.\"When Blackwell starts shipping in volume, you couldn't give Hoppers away,\" Huang said in March at Nvidia's AI conference.\"There are circumstances where Hopper is fine,\" he continued. \"Not many.\"Nvidia now releases new AI chips on an annual basis, versus the two-year cadence it had before. Advanced Micro Devices, its closest GPU competitor, followed suit.Nvidia reports quarterly results next week.Amazon, in a February filing, said it decreased the useful life for a subset of its servers from six years to five years because it conducted a study that found \"an increased pace of technology development, particularly in the area of artificial intelligence and machine learning.\"Meanwhile, other hyperscalers are extending their GPU useful life estimates for newer server equipment.Microsoft Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Satya Nadella speaks during the Microsoft Build 2025, conference in Seattle, Washington, on May 19, 2025.Jason Redmond | AFP | Getty ImagesAlthough Microsoft plans to build AI infrastructure aggressively, CEO Satya Nadella said this week that his company is trying to space out its AI chip purchases and not overinvest in a single generation of processors. He added that the biggest competitor for any new Nvidia AI chip is its predecessor.\"One of the biggest learnings we had even with Nvidia is that their pace increased in terms of their migrations,\" Nadella said. \"That was a big factor. I didn't want to go get stuck with four or five years of depreciation on one generation.\"Nvidia declined to comment.Dustin Madsen, vice president of the Society of Depreciation Professionals and founder of Emrydia Consulting, said depreciation is a financial estimate by management and that developments in a fast-moving industry like technology can change initial predictions.Depreciation estimates, Madsen said, generally take into account assumptions such as technological obsolescence, maintenance, historical lifespans of similar equipment and internal engineering analysis.\"You're going to have to convince an auditor that what you're suggesting what its life will be is actually its life,\" Madsen said. \"They will look at all of those factors, like your engineering data that suggests that the life of these assets is approximately six years, and they will audit that at a very detailed level.\"-- CNBC's Jordan Novet contributed to this story.WATCH: Chris Wood: We've removed Nvidia from our portfolio, prefer China AI nameswatch now",

    "description": "Electricity prices are surging, voters are growing angry, and the artificial intelligence industry's data centers are increasingly a target for blame ",
    "body": "Electricity prices are surging, voters are growing angry, and the artificial intelligence industry's data centers are increasingly a target for blame with U.S. mid-term elections on the horizon.Residential utility bills rose 6% on average nationwide in August compared with the same period in the previous year, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.The reasons for price increases are often complex and vary by region. But in at least three states with high concentrations of data centers, electric bills climbed much faster than the national average during that period. Prices, for example, surged by 13% in Virginia, 16% in Illinois and 12% in Ohio.The tech companies and AI labs are building data centers that consume a gigawatt or more of electricity in some cases, equivalent to more than 800,000 homes, the size of a city essentially.Virginia has the highest concentration of data centers in the world. Democrat Abigail Spanberger won the state's recent governor's race in a landslide by campaigning on cost of living. Spanberger put at least part of the blame for rising electricity prices on data centers, promising to make tech companies \"pay their own way and their fair share\" of the escalating costs.The governor's race could be a harbinger of political headwinds for the AI industry's data center buildout with the mid-term elections just a year away and Democrats zeroing in on affordability as their central issue. In Washington, some Democratic senators are targeting the close relationship that President Donald Trump has developed with the leaders of the major tech companies and AI labs.Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut and Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont took aim this week at what they described as the White House's \"sweetheart deals with Big Tech companies,\" accusing the administration of failing to protect consumers from \"being forced to subsidize the cost of data centers.\"\"The techlash is real,\" said Abraham Silverman, who served as general counsel for New Jersey's public utility board from 2019 until 2023 under outgoing Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy.\"Data centers aren't always great neighbors,\" said Silverman, now a researcher at Johns Hopkins University. \"They tend to be loud, they can be dirty and there's a number of communities, particularly in places with really high concentrations of data centers, that just don't want more data centers.\"Virginia, Ohio and IllinoisLooking at the top fives states for data centers can help sort out some of the politics of data centers from what is actually happening to electricity prices.Virginia, Illinois and Ohio are among those states and are mostly served by the same grid operator, PJM Interconnection. PJM is the largest grid in the U.S., serving more than 65 million people across 13 states including New Jersey where Silverman advised the state utility board.The PJM grid is facing a major imbalance between demand and supply. It holds auctions to secure electric capacity from power plants to ensure the grid remains reliable. The auction for 2024 to 2025 resulted in a bill of $2.2 billion. The bill then surged more than 500% to $14.7 billion for 2025 to 2026.An independent watchdog that monitors those PJM auctions found that data center demand, actual and forecast, made up $9.3 billion, or 63% of the total power capacity bill for 2025 to 2026. In the latest auction, prices jumped another 10% to $16.1 billion.\"Data center load growth is the primary reason for recent and expected capacity market conditions, including total forecast load growth, the tight supply and demand balance, and high prices,\" the firm Monitoring Analytics said in its June Independent Market Monitor report.Those capacity prices get passed down to consumers in their utility bills, Silverman said. The data center load in PJM is also impacting prices in states that are not industry leaders such as New Jersey, where prices jumped about 20% year over year. Democrat Mikie Sherrill won the governor's race in the Garden State in part on promising to freeze electric bill increases.\"It is an extremely large component of the affordability crisis we're experiencing right now,\" Silverman said of data center impact on capacity prices.There are other reasons for rising electricity prices, Silverman said. The aging electric grid needs upgrades at a time of broad inflation and the cost of building new transmission lines has gone up by double digits, he said.The utilities also point to rising demand from the expansion of domestic manufacturing and the broader electrification of the economy, such as electric vehicles and the adoption of electric heat pumps in some regions.Although some Democrats are blaming the White House, the conditions that led to rising electricity prices in the PJM region began before the second Trump administration took office.PJM's process for bringing new electric supply online has \"crashed and burned,\" Silverman said. Tax subsidies under the Inflation Reduction Act led to a surge of renewable energy projects waiting for grid connection. PJM is struggling to keep up with approvals, which can take five years in some cases, he said.PJM's watchdog said the grid may have seen tight power supplies without data centers, but the demand growth would have been slower and allowed more time for the market to address it.\"It is misleading to assert that the capacity market results are simply just a reflection of supply and demand,\" the watchdog said, describing the rapid load growth from data centers as \"unprecedented.\"Trump promised to cut electricity prices in half during his first year in office. That has not happened and is unlikely to happen in the coming years due to tight supply and demand.\"It's hard to see utility bills coming down in this decade,\" said Rob Gramlich, president of Grid Strategies, a power sector consulting firm.Texas and CaliforniaIn other states, however, the relationship between rising electricity prices and data centers is less clear. Texas, for example, is second only to Virginia with more than 400 data centers. But prices in the Lone Star state increased about 4% year over year in August, lower than the national average.Texas operates its own grid, ERCOT, with a relatively fast process that can connect new electric supply to the grid in around three years, according to a February 2024 report from the Brattle Group.California, meanwhile, has the third most data centers in the nation and the second highest residential electricity prices, nearly 80% above the national average. But prices in the Golden State increased about 1% in August 2024 over the prior year period, far below the average hike nationwide.One of the reasons California's electricity rates are so much higher than most of the country is the costs associated with preventing wildfires. PG&E, the largest utility in the state, said in March that it expects rates to remain stable this year as costs associated with wildfire prevention are taken out of customers' bills.",

    "body": "Planes line up on the tarmac at LaGuardia Airport on November 10, 2025 in New York City. Spencer Platt | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesThe U.S. has been scrambling to hire more air traffic controllers for years. The longest-ever federal government shutdown might have made that even harder.\"We need more of them to come into the profession, and this shutdown is going to make that more difficult for us to accomplish that goal,\" Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said at a press conference at Chicago O'Hare International Airport on Tuesday, a day before Congress signed a bill to fund the federal government through January, ending the shutdown.Air traffic controllers were required to work without receiving regular paychecks during the shutdown. They were paid in part on Friday, according to people familiar with the matter, but during the shutdown some had taken second jobs to make ends meet, while the lack of regular pay added to their stress, union and government officials and lawmakers have said.The Federal Aviation Administration reported low-staffing thresholds were hit that that slowed aircraft around the country during the final days of the shutdown. President Donald Trump earlier this week threatened to dock air traffic controllers' pay if they didn't go to work. On Friday, staffing levels were relatively strong around the U.S. and disruptions eased.\"It can't make it look like this is a great job because you're going to have to deal with this all the time,\" said Tim Kiefer, who teaches air traffic management at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University in Prescott, Ariz.Kiefer was an air traffic controller for more than two decades before he retired. He said shutdowns or the threat of them were common during his career. \"You may see people decide to do other things and say, 'They didn't get paid; they were stuck in the middle of a partisan dispute,'\" he said.Read more CNBC airline newsAirlines warn flight cancellations will continue even after shutdown endsPrivate-jet demand is on the rise amid government shutdown, says Flexjet CEOBoeing stems cash burn for first time since 2023 but takes $4.9 billion charge on 777X delaysAmerican Airlines is late to the luxury travel boom. Can it catch up?5 million passengersThe shortage of air traffic controllers delayed or canceled thousands flights during the shutdown, affecting the travel plans of more than 5 million people, according to Airlines for America, an industry group that includes American Airlines, United Airlines, Delta Air Lines, Southwest Airlines and others.But even with partial pay hitting bank accounts, the staffing crisis that regularly upends travel is set to continue.A government tally last year showed the U.S. was short 3,903 fully certified air traffic controllers of a goal of 14,633. Shortages have been particularly severe at busy facilities like those where controllers guide planes in and out of airports in the congested New York area, adding to flight disruptions and frustrating airline executives and customers.watch nowMeanwhile, retirements picked up in the shutdown, with 15 to 20 people retiring per day, down from a usual rate of four a day, Duffy said Tuesday. Controllers are required to retire at age 56 but can do so earlier with benefits depending on years on the job.Staffing was already thin before the shutdown began on Oct. 1, and many controllers were working six-day workweeks. By mid-November, as air traffic controllers missed two full paychecks and the shutdown passed the one-month mark, it approached crisis levels.More than 10% of U.S. departures were canceled last Sunday as bad weather combined with air traffic controller shortfalls at facilities across the country. That was the highest rate since July 19, 2024, during the CrowdStrike outage, which had an outsize impact on Delta Air Lines, leading to thousands of canceled flights and causing travel headaches, according to aviation-data firm Cirium.Hours after those cancellations spiked on Sunday, the Senate advanced a preliminary deal that led to the vote ending the shutdown this week.The Federal Aviation Administration in early November ordered airlines to cut 4% of flights from their domestic schedules at 40 major airports, blaming safety risks they found because of an increased strain on air traffic controllers. Cuts were set to ramp up to 10% on Friday, if the shutdown didn't end. Cancellations, however, improved dramatically during the week and on Friday morning, just 2% of U.S. departures were canceled, according to Cirium.The FAA brought its mandated cuts down from 6% to 3% starting on Saturday, saying it will monitor system performance throughout the weekend.The disruptions were similar to those on days with severe storms, but were more widespread across the U.S.Millions in lost revenueThe last-minute cuts were a headache for the industry, where airlines from top-moneymaker Delta to struggling carrier Spirt had already lowered their outlooks for the year after an oversupply of flights and weaker-than-expected demand earlier this year. Airlines haven't yet quantified the damage from the shutdown, but Bank of America estimated a $150 million to $200 million operating income hit for big network airlines and less than $100 million for other carriers.Travelers walk through the terminal at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport, more than a month into the ongoing U.S. government shutdown, in Arlington, Virginia, U.S., Nov. 11, 2025. Annabelle Gordon | ReutersAirline executives, exasperated by the recent disruptions, are now pushing Congress to make sure controllers are paid in the next shutdown.\"In the past week, we saw a crescendo effect as air traffic control staffing shortages led to massive and unpredictable amounts of delays and cancellations across the industry — and that was on top of a series of FAA-mandated schedule reductions,\" American Airlines CEO Robert Isom and the carrier's chief operating officer, David Seymour, said in a note to employees on Thursday, a day after the House approved a short-term funding bill. \"While we both have been in this industry for a long time, only a few other events come to mind when we think about this level of disruption.\"It could have been worse. This part of the fall travel demand is relatively light, but Thanksgiving was fast approaching when Congress ended the shutdown, concerning airline executives.\"This shutdown put tremendous strain on our aviation system and caused severe inconvenience for the millions of Americans who depend on it,\" United said in a statement. \"It should be obvious to everyone that policy debates, however urgent, should never put air travel at risk, and we urge Congress to ensure that the FAA and [Transportation Security Administration's] funding is protected in the event of any future lapse in federal appropriations.\"'Political football'It wasn't the first time a government closure has put the aviation industry under strain. The 2018-2019 shutdown, then the longest in U.S. history, ended just hours after controller shortages snarled travel in the New York City area.Some airline executives told CNBC that they were frustrated by this most recent shutdown and last-minute schedule changes, which ended up being greater than anticipated. One, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he wasn't authorized to speak to the press, said \"we were the pawns\" in the shutdown.watch nowDelta CEO Ed Bastian told CNBC's \"Squawk on the Street\" on Wednesday that \"the thing we don't like is being a political football\" and said it was unacceptable that air traffic controllers and TSA officers were forced to work without regular paychecks.The best way to prevent such disruptions is \"to ensure those workers, the next time this happens because it will happen, get paid,\" Bastian said. \"Who could disagree with that?\"The airline industry is urging Congress for legislation that could make use of funds generated by airplane ticket taxes to ensure air traffic controllers and other essential industry workers like airport screeners and Customs agents are paid.\"You don't hold the American public hostage over a political fight like that,\" Airlines for America CEO Chris Sununu, the former governor of New Hampshire, said in a virtual press conference Wednesday, shortly before the House passed the funding bill.Travelers check their flight status at Dulles International airport as the nation's air travel system begins to return to normal, as the U.S. government opens back up following the longest shutdown in U.S. history, in Dulles, Virginia, U.S. Nov. 13, 2025.

Moran this year pushed for legislation that would let the FAA use the Airport and Airway Trust Fund, which is funded by taxes on airplane tickets and fuel, to cover expenses if the government shuts down.\"The government shutdown has severely impacted our already fragile aviation industry, and recovering from its effects will take time,\" he said in a release this week. \"It's critical that we address the damage done and look at the long-term effects of the shutdown.\"Lawmakers earlier this year approved $12.5 billion to improve air traffic control, though the industry said it needs billions more to modernize the system in the U.S.The fatal collision of an American Airlines regional jet and an Army Black Hawk helicopter in Washington, D.C., in January also made hiring controllers more urgent, especially at congested facilities.About a month after the crash, Duffy announced the country's air traffic controller academy would raise pay for students, and he authorized more universities to teach a similar curriculum to help ease the shortage. The academy in Oklahoma City also stayed open, a different tactic than in the 2018-2019 shutdown.But those aren't immediate fixes. It takes years for controllers to be fully trained to work at some of the more complex facilities, and applicants to the academy can be no older than 30.",

    "body": "Astypalea's Chora, or capital.Ed Moskalenko | Getty ImagesThe tiny, butterfly-shaped Greek island of Astypalea has all the ingredients for a relaxing vacation: myriad beaches with clear waters, great seafood and a castle perched above a traditional white town with winding alleys and views across the Aegean Sea.It's also less developed than its larger neighbors like Rhodes and Kos, and with a population of just 1,400, Astypalea made for a chilled holiday destination when I visited in June.Some of the lanes in the island's Chora — or capital — are so small that donkeys carry construction tools to hard-to-reach building sites, but the mode of transport most noticeable on Astypalea is a fleet of electric minibuses, part of a scheme called AstyBus — an unusual sight for the Greek islands.It's worth starting a trip to the island by visiting the remains of the 15th century Venetian castle high above the Chora, which was built on the site of other structures including from the Roman and Byzantine eras. From there I walked down towards the eight traditional, red-roofed windmills at the centre of the town, originally constructed to mill grain in the 13th and 14th centuries. At the bottom of the hill is the island's small but fascinating Archaeological Museum, with artefacts from the pre-historic period to the Middle Ages.To begin with, I used the bus to get from the bottom of the Chora to the top when it was too hot to walk up its winding streets, before exploring further. Agios Dimitrios church in the village of Maltezana, AstypaleaLucy HandleyMy first stop was Maltezana, a winding 20-minute bus ride from the Chora, and Astypalea's second-largest settlement. I disembarked a stop or two inland to look inside Agios Dimitros, a small church opposite Maltezana's grocery store. While the church is painted in the traditional blue and white style on the outside, it is ornately-decorated inside, with bible scenes in blue and gold on its walls and ceiling.A short walk from the church, a string of restaurants line a narrow beach. Its clear, shallow waters were pleasant to wade into after lazing under one of the scrubby trees on the sand.Over the next few days I visited more beaches using the AstyBus: Schinonta, a quiet bay along from Maltezana, and tree-lined Livadi, which is just over the hill from the Chora, and has a few restaurants right on the beach. The bus initiative is part of a grand plan to turn Astypalea into a \"smart and sustainable island\" — a partnership between the Greek government and Volkswagen. It claims to be a first of its kind initiative for the Greek islands, and aims to replace traditional combustion-engine vehicles with electric-powered cars, and support an overall shift to renewable energy.Authorities want to keep the island unspoiled, putting the focus on sustainability and moderate development.Volkswagen supplied electric minibuses to Astypalea, part of an initiative for the island to become \"smart and sustainable.\"Lucy HandleyAlongside the EVs, a hybrid power station is being built. In an interview with CNBC, Astypalea's mayor Nikolaos Komineas said it will cover more than 50% of the island's energy needs during the summer, with plans for wind generation too. Komineas also wants to reduce the number of single-use plastic bottles by making tap water safe to drink and having hotels and other accommodation providers offer reusable water bottles. \"My dream is that by the end of 2027, early 2028, all of those new infrastructures are going to be on the island,\" he said.An out-of-the-way beachHaving traveled by bus to several beaches, I wanted to go somewhere more remote. I'd seen photos of Vatses, a beach on the tip of the left-hand wing of the Astypalea butterfly; a wide, sandy bay bordered by sparse, rocky cliffs. I needed a car for the trip as it was out of Astybus's coverage area, and hired an EV — a VW ID.3 — using the AstyGO app. I uploaded my driver's license and credit card to the app, which then uses Bluetooth to access vehicles.While the car was smooth to drive, getting into it was less so, with the app needing to be rebooted before the vehicle would start, and most of the instructions on the dashboard being in Greek only.The drive to Vatses was not for the faint-hearted: an unsealed road gave way to a narrow track with a steep drop on one side. But the beach was beautiful and resembled its photos, with a cafe on one side serving Greek salads, coffee and cocktails, plus sun loungers for rent and trees to lie under — an easy place to spend the afternoon.Vatses beach on Astypalea, Greece, is accessed via an unsealed road.George Papapostolou | Moment Open | Getty ImagesAccessing the car for the return journey also proved tricky. Having been at the beach for several hours, I'd been automatically logged out of the AstyGO app, and without 5G phone signal I couldn't open the car door, let alone start the engine. Fortunately, the cafe had Wi-Fi, and I was able to drive back up the rocky road — trailing a goat for part of the way. Safely back in the Chora, I enjoyed an al-fresco dinner at Navagos, which has a tapas-style modern Greek menu that included locally-made sausages with baked potatoes and slow-cooked chickpeas with lemon sauce. For pastries or dessert, a favorite cafe was Glykia, a little way up the hill past the Chora's beach.Even in June, Astypalea felt like like a local's island, and a longtime visitor described it as being \"like Santorini 20 years ago.\" Overtourism is a big problem for some Greek islands, with the mayor of Santorini (about 100km west of Astypalea) describing the pressure of millions of visitors as becoming \"unbearable,\" in an interview with the Guardian last year.Astypalea receives around 32,000 to 36,000 tourists a year, according to the mayor's office. Santorini, on the other hand, which is around three-quarters of the size, welcomes upwards of 3-million visitors.Astypalea takes a more-balanced approach towards tourism. The mayor and the local government turned down a proposal to build 200 villas on the island last year. \"We don't want a crowded island,\" he said. \"We don't want to spoil the island at all. We want to keep the nature as it is.\"",

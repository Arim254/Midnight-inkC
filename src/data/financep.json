    "body": "Cheng Xin | Getty ImagesTikTok users have been deleting the app at a higher rate since the company announced that its U.S. operations would be housed in a new joint venture.The daily average of U.S. users deleting the TikTok app has increased nearly 150% over the past five days compared with the previous three months, market intelligence firm Sensor Tower told CNBC.Last Thursday, TikTok said it had formed a joint venture to keep the video-sharing app operating in the U.S. under new American leadership. The company named Adam Presser, formerly TikTok's head of operations, as CEO of the joint venture. Some users took to social media to voice their skepticism about the new joint venture after being prompted to agree to an updated privacy policy on Thursday.Several social media posts pointed to language in the new policy that describes the types of data TikTok may collect, including sensitive information such as \"your racial or ethnic origin\" as well as \"sexual life or sexual orientation, status as transgender or nonbinary, citizenship or immigration status, or financial information.\"Despite the social media uproar, that language does not appear to be new. An archived version of the policy from August 2024 includes the same provisions.Those concerns appear to have weighed on sentiment around the app after the announcement of the joint venture, contributing to a spike in uninstalls over the past several days.watch now\"If I can delete my biggest platform because their terms of agreement and censorship have gotten out of control, so can you!\" creator Dre Ronayne posted on Threads, the micro-blogging service owned by Meta. Ronayne said she had nearly 400,000 followers on TikTok before deleting her account on Sunday.Other creators have also reported problems posting to the app, with users complaining about outages and video uploads failing to go through.The social media company hasn't communicated to its creators what the joint venture means for them, Nadya Okamoto, a TikTok creator with over 4 million followers, told CNBC. \"That's why there is so much paranoia, because we're all kind of looking at this platform and we just don't know what's happening,\" she said. Okamoto told CNBC she has experienced issues with the app over the past several days and has been unable to upload videos for roughly 24 hours. During the uncertainty, she is continuing to post her content on Instagram and Google's YouTube.\"Online there's a lot of conversation about — is this all coincidence or censorship, and what does this look like?\" Okamoto said. \"For everything to be happening at once, it is very scary.\"An X account associated with the TikTok joint venture said on Monday that the services issue was caused by a power outage at a U.S. data center.\"We're working with our data center partner to stabilize our service. We're sorry for this disruption and hope to resolve it soon,\" the account wrote.However, the increase in uninstalls has not translated into a meaningful drop in U.S. usage. TikTok's active user levels in the U.S. have remained relatively flat compared with the previous week, according to Sensor Tower.Competing apps, however, have seen a bump in interest. Sensor Tower data shows U.S. downloads for UpScrolled increased more than tenfold compared with the prior week, while Skylight Social rose 919% and Chinese-owned Rednote climbed 53% week over week.TikTok did not respond to request for comment.",

Nurphoto | Nurphoto | Getty ImagesSouth Korea's ruling Democratic Party said it would pass a special act on the U.S. trade deal by end- February, according to Yonhap, after U.S. President Donald Trump threatened higher tariffs on South Korean exports. Earlier on Tuesday, Trump said he was raising tariffs on South Korean exports to 25% from the current 15%, citing a delay in the country's parliament approving the Washington-Seoul trade deal agreed in July last year. Spokesperson of the ruling Democratic Party Kim Hyun-jung said Trump was likely referring to the Special Act on Strategic Investment Management between Korea and the United States, according to a Google translation of the statement in Korean, submitted to the country's parliament last November.The bill aims to establish a state-run investment corporation to manage Seoul's planned $350 billion investment pledge to Washington. Kim said that five related bills have been submitted to the National Assembly, and are scheduled to be reviewed, adding that \"the fact that both the Democratic Party of Korea and the People Power Party have proposed these bills will likely expedite their passage.\"The ruling DP currently holds 162 seats in the 300 seat National Assembly with four vacant seats, while the PPP holds 107.  \"What is needed now is to quickly confirm the intent and facts of the U.S statement and correct any misunderstandings,\" she said. South Korea's presidential office said that it had called a meeting to review and discuss responses to Trump's announcement on Tuesday, and reiterated its commitment to implementing the tariff agreement. Earlier in the day, the office said it had not received any official notice or explanation from the U.S. regarding the announcement, according to local media outlet Yonhap. South Korea's finance ministry said that it will keep the U.S. informed on the legislative process, while Seoul's trade ministry said that industry minister Kim Jung-kwan will visit Washington for talks on the matter, Yonhap reported.\"It is time for the government and the ruling and opposition parties in the National Assembly to join forces. I look forward to the People Power Party's bipartisan cooperation,\" Kim said.South Korean automakers Hyundai and Kia plunged in early trade following Trump's threats, but later pared losses. Hyundai last traded 0.1% down, and Kia was down 1.16%. The broader Kospi was up 1.9%, while the small-cap Kosdaq index climbed 0.89%. Stock Chart IconStock chart icon",

Last year, UPS closed 93 buildings, it reiterated Tuesday. The company is also planning to \"further deploy automation\" across its network, according to Dykes.The planned job cuts come after UPS eliminated 48,000 jobs last year, 34,000 of which were operational and 14,000 of which were management. The company had previously estimated those combined reductions to total around 20,000. UPS is in the midst of a turnaround plan under CEO Carol Tomé, aiming to reinvigorate the business. Though Amazon was previously UPS' largest customer, the two companies are in the process of gliding down operations together. UPS said Tuesday it expects a total of $3 billion in savings related to the Amazon unwind.UPS reported fourth-quarter earnings Tuesday, beating Wall Street estimates and citing encouraging process in its turnaround efforts.Shares of the company were up almost 2% in morning trading.

    "body": "watch nowStock Chart IconStock chart iconHumana shares in the past dayThe proposal entails a net average payment increase of 0.09% for Medicare Advantage plans in 2027, according to a release from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, on Monday. That number is significantly less than Wall Street analysts' expectations that the agency would propose a rate increase of between 4% and 6% for next year. CMS typically finalizes Medicare Advantage rates in early April. If the current proposal holds, the rate increase would result in more than $700 million more in payments to Medicare Advantage plans in 2027, according to the agency's release. The closely watched government payment rate determines how much insurers can charge for monthly premiums and plan benefits they offer, and ultimately, their profits. The Wall Street Journal first reported about the government's rate proposal on Monday. Medicare Advantage is a privately run health insurance plan contracted by Medicare. More than half of Medicare beneficiaries are enrolled in such plans, enticed by lower monthly premiums and extra benefits not covered by traditional Medicare, according to health policy research firm KFF.CMS said it is also looking to slash a moneymaking industry billing practice. Part of the proposal aims to improve payment accuracy and ensure Medicare insurers get adequately reimbursed, the Journal reported. \"These proposed payment policies are about making sure Medicare Advantage works better for the people it serves,\" said CMS Administrator Dr. Mehmet Oz in the release. \"By strengthening payment accuracy and modernizing risk adjustment, CMS is helping ensure beneficiaries continue to have affordable plan choices and reliable benefits, while protecting taxpayers from unnecessary spending that is not oriented towards addressing real health needs.\" ",

In a securities filing, Pinterest said it expects the cuts will be complete by the end of its third quarter in late September. Shares of Pinterest slipped about 8%. The social media company said it's \"reallocating resources\" to AI-focused teams and prioritizing \"AI-powered products and capabilities.\" It said it's also reshaping its sales and marketing strategy.Read more CNBC tech newsApple, Google host dozens of AI 'nudify' apps like Grok, report findsBlockbuster social media trial kicks off, with more to come this yearMeta inks deal to pay Corning up to $6 billion for fiber-optic cables in AI data centersTikTok blames data center outages for U.S. app problems, denies censorship claimsThe company said it expects to record pre-tax restructuring charges of about $35 million to $45 million. Pinterest had more than 4,500 employees globally as of last April, according to its most recent proxy filing.Pinterest has looked to inject AI throughout its platform to show more personalized and relevant content to users. The company last October released a \"Pinterest Assistant\" shopping tool.  At the same time, Pinterest has rolled out more automated advertising tools for marketers as it faces increasing competition from TikTok, Meta's Facebook and Instagram.  \"Our investments in AI and product innovation are paying off,\" Pinterest CEO Bill Ready said in November. \"We've become a leader in visual search and have effectively turned our platform into an AI-powered shopping assistant for 600 million customers.\"Pinterest isn't the only company downsizing as it invests in AI. AI was cited as the reason for almost 55,000 layoffs in the U.S. last year, according to consulting firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas.Some experts have questioned whether the technology is the real source of the job reductions, saying some companies could be \"AI-washing,\" or blaming layoffs on the new technology to cover up cost-cutting efforts or other issues with their businesses.  watch now",

    "body": "Courtesy: RythmChicago's United Center is stepping into new territory for live events, becoming the first major U.S. arena to offer cannabis drinks at its concessions.The arena — home of the NBA's Chicago Bulls and NHL's Chicago Blackhawks — announced Tuesday a multi-year partnership with Rythm, a hemp-derived THC beverage company that makes Rythm- and Señorita-branded drinks, to sell the cans at concerts and live events.The beverages will be available for adults 21 and older and sold alongside alcohol and soft drinks.\"We're seeing consumers choose this at the liquor store, at venues, at restaurants, and so it's a time when consumers are looking for alternatives,\" said Ben Kovler, CEO of Green Thumb Industries, which owns a stake in Rythm. \"We know consumers want them,\" Kovler said. \"They believe in no hangovers, they want the alternative.\"Consumer interest in hemp-derived THC products has been steadily rising in recent years. According to a study conducted by consumer researcher Brightfield Group and cited by Bernstein, 14% of U.S. adults reported using some type of hemp-derived THC product in the first quarter of 2025, up from just 8% a year earlier. \"As we continue to evolve offerings for our guests, RYTHM's Chicago roots made its beverage line a natural fit for the United Center experience,\" said Joe Myhra, United Center's chief operating officer in a press release.The drinks will be available during concerts at the venue starting in early February and will serve as a test case for cannabis in mainstream venues even as lawmakers debate tightening rules around the category over safety concerns. Kovler said the product sales will be aligned with safety and compliance measures in line with Illinois law, though the company didn't specify serving limits or monitoring protocols. \"The American consumer is very familiar with self-dosing a drink, and self-moderating,\" Kovler said, \"unlike a [THC] gummy — it's hard for most Americans to eat only one gummy.\" THC regulation turmoilLast year, Congress passed a funding bill that included a THC cap effectively banning most hemp-derived THC products — the same category now being sold at the United Center — starting in November. Public health advocates argued the market had outpaced regulation, while industry groups warned a sweeping ban could disrupt billions in consumer sales. That legislation was followed by revisions to the 2018 Farm Bill, which added exclusions to the federal definition of hemp. In effect, the changes closed the so-called \"hemp loophole\" and could make many hemp-based THC beverages in a matter of a months, barring further policy shifts. Lawmakers in both chambers of Congress have already introduced legislation to keep intoxicating hemp products legal until 2028. A separate bipartisan bill was also submitted that would set a regulatory framework for intoxicating hemp beverages and CBD products, giving the industry hope for change before the current expiration. \"The timing in government and rules is never good and is never clear,\" said Kovler. \"It remains murky, but we're guided by the consumer, and that gives us a lot of confidence betting on this now.\"Adding to the policy shakeup, the Trump administration last year moved to reclassify cannabis under the Controlled Substances Act — a shift that sent cannabis stocks higher and raised questions about taxation, banking access and federal oversight. While rescheduling primarily affects state-legal marijuana businesses rather than hemp-derived products, it signals growing willingness in Washington to revisit decades-old cannabis policy. If policy momentum continues, analysts say the door could swing open to more cannabis-related products entering mainstream venues, but with some risk. \"Investing in cannabis remains a volatile and challenging endeavor, and one that is not for the faint-of-heart,\" Bernstein analyst Nadine Sarwat wrote in a recent research note.

    "body": "watch nowAmerican Airlines projected Tuesday that its focus on premium will \"begin delivering results in 2026\" as the carrier races to catch up to its far more profitable rivals and capitalize on strong demand from high-spending customers.The Fort Worth, Texas-based airline projected it will deliver nearly $2 of improvement in adjusted earnings per share at the midpoint over last year.American also expects to earn 7% to 10% more revenue in the first three months of 2026 compared with 2025.American's stock fell 2% in early trading.Here is how American performed in the fourth quarter compared with Wall Street estimates compiled by LSEG:Earnings per share: 16 cents adjusted vs. 34 cents expectedRevenue: $14 billion vs. $14.03 billion expectedAmerican posted net income of $99 million, or 15 cents per share, down from $590 million, or 84 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue was up 2.5% from last year. Excluding net special items, the company reported adjusted earnings per share of 16 cents.\"American Airlines is positioned for significant upside in 2026 and beyond,\" CEO Robert Isom said in a statement. \"We have built a strong foundation, and we look forward to taking advantage of the investments we have made in our customer experience, network, fleet, partnerships and loyalty program.\"The airline also said the government shutdown negatively impacted fourth-quarter revenue by approximately $325 million.\"Fourth quarter, it hit us hard,\" Isom said on CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" on Tuesday morning. \"The government shutdown hit us, it hit us harder than others. ... The good news on that is that as soon as the government shutdown got over, we've seen bookings return.\"American said this weekend's winter storm, which marked Sunday as the largest flight cancellation day since the pandemic hit in early 2020, has resulted in a 1.5 percentage point reduction to the company's first-quarter 2026 capacity guidance, along with an estimated negative revenue impact of $150 million to $200 million. American said Monday that five of its nine hub airports were disrupted by the storm, including its largest hub at Dallas Fort Worth International Airport. On a call with analysts Tuesday, Isom said the airline had to cancel more than 9,000 flights over the past four days, making it the largest weather-related disruption in its history.The airline said passenger unit revenue was down 2.5% year over year, though that number would have been positive without the impact from the government shutdown. Premium product offerings continued to perform well, with year-over-year premium unit revenue outpacing the main cabin for the fourth quarter. \"I like where we're headed,\" Isom told CNBC. \"Premium traffic is going to stay strong, and our product, again, is resonating.\"American has been revamping its fleet, lounges, and food and beverages to draw in customers who are willing to spend more on premium tickets and co-branded credit cards.

    "body": "Todd Lyons, acting director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, participates in a television interview outside the White House, in Washington, Nov. 3, 2025.Brendan Smialowski | AFP | Getty ImagesA top federal judge in Minnesota ordered the acting head of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement to personally appear at a hearing in Minneapolis on Friday to explain why he should not be held in contempt of court after his agency repeatedly violated judicial orders related to immigration enforcement actions.The three-page order issued late Monday to ICE acting Director Todd Lyons by U.S. District Court Chief Judge Patrick Schiltz was scathing, accusing federal immigration authorities of failing to comply with \"dozens of court orders\" in recent weeks, including one issued by the judge mandating a bond hearing for a detained immigrant.\"This Court has been extremely patient with respondents, even though respondents decided to send thousands of agents to Minnesota to detain aliens without making any provision for dealing with the hundreds of habeas petitions and other lawsuits that were sure to result,\" Schiltz wrote in the order.\"This Court's patience is at an end,\" Schiltz wrote. The judge said that the Department of Homeland Security and Lyons' agency, which is a division of DHS, \"have continually assured the Court that they recognize their obligation to comply with Court orders,\" and that they would take steps to honor those orders.\"Unfortunately, though, the violations continue,\" Schiltz wrote. \"Accordingly, the Court will order Todd Lyons, the Acting Director of ICE, to appear personally before the Court and show cause why he should not be held in contempt of Court,\" Schiltz wrote.CNBC has requested comment from ICE on the order.The judge called his order \"an extraordinary step.\"\"But the extent of ICE's violation of court orders is likewise extraordinary, and lesser measures have been tried and failed,\" Schiltz wrote.The order comes as Minnesota state officials press for ICE and other federal immigration authorities to cease aggressive actions rounding up undocumented people in Minneapolis and elsewhere in the state.Schiltz's order also came two days after federal agents fatally shot Alex Pretti, a 37-year-old ICU nurse on a Minneapolis street, and weeks after an ICE agent shot and killed mom of three Renee Good in her car. Both Pretti and Good were U.S. citizens.Those, and other incidents, have sparked widespread outrage in the state and nationally.Read more CNBC politics coverageAlex Pretti killing: Minnesota CEOs, including UnitedHealth, Target, call for 'immediate deescalation'After Minneapolis shooting, government hurtles toward shutdown over DHS fundingTrump threatens to impose 100% tariff if Canada makes deal with ChinaTrump withdraws 'Board of Peace' invitation to Carney in widening riftHouse passes final funding bills 8 days before shutdown, Senate now will considerGreenland PM: Trump-NATO deal framework unclear, sovereignty is a red lineTrump sues Jamie Dimon, JPMorgan Chase over debanking the suit calls 'political'Trump says he reached Greenland deal 'framework' with NATO, backs off tariffsTrump interview live updates: CNBC's Joe Kernen sits down with the president at DavosThe judge's order does not relate to either shooting but to his previous order that DHS and ICE grant a detained immigrant a bond hearing by last Wednesday.That man remains detained despite Schiltz's directive, according to a court filing by the man's lawyer.\"This is one of dozens of court orders with which respondents have failed to comply in recent weeks,\" Schiltz wrote Monday.\"The practical consequence of respondents' failure to comply has almost always been significant hardship to aliens (many of whom have lawfully lived and worked in the United States for years and done absolutely nothing wrong): The detention of an alien is extended, or an alien who should remain in Minnesota is flown to Texas, or an alien who has been flown to Texas is released there and told to figure out a way to get home,\" the judge wrote.Schiltz said that if, before the hearing, the parties inform him that the detained man \"has been released from custody, the Court will cancel the hearing and will not require Lyons to appear.\"",

    "body": "UnitedHealth Group Inc. signage on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York, US, on Wednesday, Dec. 31, 2025. Michael Nagle | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesUnitedHealth Group on Tuesday posted a modest fourth-quarter earnings beat, but issued soft revenue guidance, as the parent company of the nation's largest private insurer works to turn itself around amid higher-than-expected medical costs. Here's what the company reported for the fourth quarter compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:Earnings per share: $2.11 adjusted vs. $2.10 expectedRevenue: $113.2 billion vs. $113.82 billion expectedThe results come two days after UnitedHealth CEO Stephen Hemsley and other chief executives of Minnesota's largest businesses banded together to sign an open letter calling for an \"immediate deescalation of tensions\" in the state after federal immigration agents fatally shot U.S. citizen Alex Pretti, a 37-year-old ICU nurse. The company posted fourth-quarter net income of $10 million, or 1 cent per share, compared with $5.54 billion, or $5.98 per share, in the year-ago period. Excluding items like business divestitures, restructuring and costs related to a massive cyberattack on its business unit Change Healthcare, UnitedHealth earned $2.11 per share.Revenue climbed from $100.81 billion in the prior-year quarter. UnitedHealth is banking on a new leadership team to carry out a turnaround plan. The strategy involves shrinking membership, raising prices, cutting benefits and increasing transparency to restore profitability — along with the company's reputation — after a series of hurdles over the last two years. UnitedHealth expects 2026 revenue to exceed $439 billion, a 2% year-over-year decline that reflects \"right-sizing across the enterprise,\" the company said in a release. That comes far below the $454.6 billion in sales that analysts were expecting for the year. \"It's the first time in a decade that UnitedHealth Group has had declining revenue,\" CFO Wayne DeVeydt said in an interview, referring to the sales guidance. He pointed to three factors driving the expected decline, including the company's divestitures in the fourth quarter and others set for later this year, such as its operations in the U.K. and South America. He also pointed to a \"fairly sizable\" overall U.S. membership decline of more than 3 million in 2026. \"I would say that in the fourth quarter, we righted the ship in the sense that we removed through the fraction, obviously, South America, European operations,\" he said. \"We are focusing on American domestic businesses and we have essentially strengthened the balance sheet and repositioned the company for the historical growth that investors have seen.\"The third factor is that 2026 is the final year of the transition to Medicare's new coding system – known as V28 – which has reduced payments to insurers by changing how patient diagnoses are weighted, DeVeydt said. That will translate to a $6 billion revenue hit, $2 billion of which will impact the company's insurer, UnitedHealthcare, with the rest affecting its Optum health-care unit, he noted. More CNBC health coverageThe Trump administration is changing Covid, childhood vaccine recommendations – here's what it means for youU.S. to impose 100% tariff on branded, patented drugs unless firms build plants locally, Trump saysEli Lilly to build $6.5 billion Texas manufacturing facility for obesity pill, other drugsOn Monday, shares of UnitedHealth and other health insurers plunged after the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services proposed nearly flat payment rates for insurers in Medicare Advantage, the privately run insurance program that now covers more than half of all Medicare beneficiaries.That closely watched government payment rate determines how much insurers can charge for monthly premiums and plan benefits they offer — and ultimately helps to shape their profits. Medical costs from Medicare Advantage patients have spiked over the last two years as more older adults return to hospitals to undergo procedures they had delayed during the pandemic, such as joint and hip replacements. In the fourth quarter, those medical costs were \"still elevated and high but not growing beyond expectations,\" DeVeydt said. For 2026, UnitedHealth expects its insurance segment's medical benefit ratio — a measure of total medical expenses paid relative to premiums collected — to come in at 88.8%, plus or minus 50 basis points. That would be an improvement from the 89.1% ratio reported for 2025. A lower ratio typically indicates that the company collected more in premiums than it paid out in benefits, resulting in higher profitability.",

    "body": "Under the EU's Digital Markets Act, Apple is required to allow developers to freely inform customers of alternative offers outside its App Store.Gabby Jones | Bloomberg via Getty ImagesThe Apple and Google Play app stores are hosting dozens of \"nudify\" apps that can take photos of people and use artificial intelligence to generate nude images of them, according to a report Tuesday from an industry watchdog. A review of the two app stores conducted in January by Tech Transparency Project found 55 nudify apps on Google Play and 47 in the Apple App Store, according to the organization's report that was shared exclusively with CNBC.After being contacted by TPP and CNBC last week, an Apple spokesperson on Monday said that the company removed 28 apps identified in the report. The iPhone maker said it also alerted developers of other apps that they risk removal from the Apple App Store if guideline violations aren't addressed.Two of the apps removed by Apple were restored to the store after the developers resubmitted new versions that addressed guideline concerns, a spokesman for the company told CNBC. \"Both companies say they are dedicated to the safety and security of users, but they host a collection of apps that can turn an innocuous photo of a woman into an abusive, sexualized image,\" TTP wrote in its report about Apple and Google.TTP told CNBC on Monday that a review of the Apple App Store found that only 24 apps were removed by the tech company.A Google spokesperson told CNBC that the company suspended several apps referenced in the report for violating its app store's policies, saying that it investigates when policy violations are reported. The company declined to say specifically how many apps it had removed, because its investigation into the apps identified by TTP was ongoing. The report comes after Elon Musk's xAI faced backlash earlier this month when its Grok AI tool responded to user prompts and generated sexualized photos of women and children.The watchdog organization identified these apps on the two stores by searching for terms like \"nudify\" and \"undress\" to find apps, and tested those apps using AI-generated images of fully clothed women. The project tested two types of apps — those that used AI to render the images of the women without clothes, as well as \"face swap\" apps that superimposed the original women's faces onto images of nude women. \"It's very clear, these are not just 'change outfit' apps,\" Katie Paul, TPP's director, told CNBC. \"These were definitely designed for non-consensual sexualization of people.\"watch nowCNBC investigated the dangers of nudify apps and websites in a report published in September. In its investigation, CNBC followed a group of women in Minnesota whose public social media photos were fed into a nudify service to create sexualized deepfakes without their consent. Because the women were all adults and the man who generated the pornographic deepfakes didn't necessarily distribute them, no apparent crime was committed. Over 80 women were victimized.CNBC found that new AI models have made it easier than ever to generate deepfake nudes and explicit content, with the services bundled into user-friendly apps like the ones found by TTP. Of the apps reviewed, 14 were based out of China, according to TPP. Paul said that adds an extra security concern.\"China's data retention laws mean that the Chinese government has right to data from any company anywhere in China,\" Paul said. \"So if somebody's making deepfake nudes of you, those are now in the hands of the Chinese government if they use one of those apps.\"After xAI drew scrutiny over its own nudify capabilities, Grok's AI acknowledged \"lapses in safeguards\" that it is \"urgently fixing,\" in a reply to one X user.On Monday, the European Commission said it opened an investigation into X over Grok's spreading of sexually explicit content.In response to CNBC's request for comment, xAI sent an automated reply that said \"Legacy Media Lies.\"Joe Raedle | Getty ImagesIn August, the National Association of Attorneys General wrote to payment platforms, including Apple Pay and Google Pay, raising concerns about services that generate non-consensual intimate images and requesting that the platforms remove such services from their networks.Democratic senators from Oregon, New Mexico and Massachusetts asked Apple and Google to remove X from their app stores in a letter this month, saying that the mass generation of non-consensual sexualized images violates the stores' distribution terms.The Google Play Developer Policy Center says the platform doesn't allow \"apps that claim to undress people or see through clothing, even if labeled as prank or entertainment apps.\" Apple's app review guidelines bans material that is \"overtly sexual or pornographic.\" TTP's identified apps collectively have over 700 million downloads worldwide and have generated $117 million in revenue, the report says, citing app analytics firm AppMagic. Both Apple and Google take a cut of revenue generated by apps distributed through their stores. \"The fact that they are not adhering to their own policies, which are designed to protect people from non-consensual nude imagery and non-consensual pornography, raises a lot of questions about how they can present themselves as trusted app platforms,\" Paul said.-- CNBC's Jonathan Vanian and Katie Tarasov contributed to this report",

    "body": "U.S President Donald Trump and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Washington, DC, on Feb. 13, 2025.Andrew Caballero-reynolds | Afp | Getty ImagesThe ink is barely dry on the European Union and India's historic trade deal but all eyes are now on how President Donald Trump will react to the free trade agreement that's widely seen as a strategic hedge against the U.S.' volatile trade policies and tariff threats.The deal, which was confirmed earlier Tuesday, has taken almost two decades to agree and will see the trading behemoths gradually cut tariffs to zero on the majority of each other's imports, except on some key products and sectors.Trump is yet to react publicly to the EU-India deal, which was announced in the early hours of Tuesday morning European time, but he and the White House are unlikely to be happy with the deal. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has already criticized the EU for forging ahead with a trade agreement with India.\"The U.S. has made much bigger sacrifices than Europeans have. We have put 25% tariffs on India for buying Russian oil. Guess what happened last week? The Europeans signed a trade deal with India,\" Bessent told ABC News on Sunday.India's minister of petroleum and natural gas, Hardeep Singh Puri, told CNBC on Tuesday that he expected the U.S.-India relationship to remain positive and for a trade deal to be completed soon.\"The relationship structure [between the U.S. and India] is very strong. I would try and look at the positive side, I'm not a soothsayer, I don't know when trade deals will get signed, how long it takes ... but everybody needs to chill a bit.\" Hardeep Singh Puri told CNBC's Amitoj Singh.India supported the multilateral trading system, he said, and this was evident in the latest deal with the EU: \"If you were to make the statement that the multilateral trading system, the global economy, is undergoing challenges, then I don't think anyone would want to challenge that assessment. On the Indian side, there are several sectors which are looking to an enhanced European market,\" he said.How will Trump react?Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi praised the \"landmark\" free trade agreement earlier, while both he and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen called it the \"mother of all deals.\" Von der Leyen said the agreement will allow the two sides to grow their strategic relationship. watch nowBoth leaders are due to speak at an EU-India summit later Tuesday and are likely to praise a deal that sees trade barriers eased and tariffs slashed at a time when their export-oriented industries face punitive duties from the U.S.The White House imposed a 15% tariff on EU imports last year despite agreeing on a trade deal with the bloc, while goods from India were slapped with a more punitive 50%, in part because of its ongoing oil purchases from Russia.Hosuk Lee-Makiyama, director of the European Centre for International Political Economy, said the EU-India trade deal is one of the best agreements available to the two sides, which have traditionally been protectionist when it comes to strategic sectors of their economies, like agriculture and autos.\"This is a deal that they can do that will have a positive impact, while the U.S. and China will remain closed as new market openings go. So in that respect, this is probably one of the best deals they can do at the moment,\" Lee-Makiyama told CNBC on Tuesday.watch nowBoth India and the EU had reasons for forging ahead with a deal, despite the inevitable wrath it might unleash in Washington, he added.\"But there is a significant difference [with this landmark deal], though, which is that India actually failed to secure the deal with United States,\" while \"EU trade ministers are now getting used to the fact that there is a new tariff threat coming from Washington every week, and of course, their skins get a little bit thicker [each time],\" he told CNBC's \"Europe Early Edition.\"Needs mustThere will undoubtedly be some wariness in Europe about upsetting the U.S. at a time when its commitment to its European allies appears highly vulnerable, particularly when it comes to the collective defense principle that's a central tenet of the NATO military alliance.David McAllister, member of the European Parliament and chair of its foreign affairs committee, summed up the balancing act that the region needs to maintain between pursuing its own economic interests while maintaining good relations with Washington.\"Europe needs to become more sovereign. Europe needs to grow up, and that means that we need to become economically more competitive,\" he told CNBC's \"Europe Early Edition\" on Tuesday.\"We need to do much more for our own security and defense, but we also want to maintain the close trans-Atlantic relationship with the United States ... but this relationship needs to be based on mutual respect and trust,\" he said.",

    "body": "Facebook co-founder and Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg sits in his seat inside a bipartisan Artificial Intelligence Insight Forum for all U.S. senators hosted by Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer at the U.S. Capitol in Washington, D.C., on Sept. 13, 2023.Leah Millis | ReutersA landmark case against social media giants Meta, Alphabet's YouTube and TikTok is set to begin Tuesday in Los Angeles Superior Court. It's the first of several high-profile legal cases kicking off in 2026 that center on allegations that the companies misled the public about the safety of their apps despite knowing that certain design choices contributed to various harms on young users.Social media companies have long used Section 230, the part of the Communications Decency Act that protects Internet speech, to shield themselves from liability for the content posted on their platform. That's why in these cases, the plaintiffs are focusing their cases on alleged app-design flaws and related public misrepresentations of the safety of the services as a way to steer the arguments away from Section 230-related protections.These trials have been compared to those brought against 'Big Tobacco' in the 1990s, and experts have said these cases could have long-lasting implications on regulation and public perception of these companies.In Jan. 2024, lawmakers grilled several social media executives, including Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, during a Senate hearing focused on the companies' efforts to safeguard children on their platforms.The case kicking off Tuesday focuses on a young woman who alleges that she became addicted to social media as a minor because of certain features and characteristics of apps like Instagram, TikTok and YouTube. Snap was also part of the civil lawsuit, but the company behind the app Snapchat reached a settlement with the plaintiff last week before the trial commenced.A separate trial kicks off next week in Santa Fe, New Mexico, in which the state's attorney general alleges that Meta's Facebook and Instagram services failed to safeguard their apps from online predators who sexually exploited various children who used the services.The New Mexico case is separate from other lawsuits filed by various state attorneys general across the U.S. that allege that design flaws in Meta apps have harmed the mental-well being of children. The company has said it expects those cases to begin as soon as the second half of 2026.Yet another trial is expected to commence in the Northern District of California later this year that involves Meta, TikTok, YouTube and Snap. That federal cases also involves allegations that these companies' created defective apps that encourage unhealthy and addictive behaviors in teens and children.Separately, New York City in October filed a lawsuit against Meta, Google, Snap and TikTok, arguing that they created addictive platforms that contribute to mental health issues among childrenIn the case this week, the three companies' legal defense teams are expected to argue that third-party content posted to its platforms should be held liable, rather than their product designs.Google CEO Sundar Pichai attends a meeting of the White House Task Force on Artificial Intelligence (AI) Education in the East Room at the White House in Washington, D.C., U.S., September 4, 2025. Brian Snyder | ReutersFirst filed in 2022 by a plaintiff listed as \"KGM\" and her mother, the lawsuit is the first of its kind to go to trial, and it's seen as a bellwether for several other lawsuits that have been filed across the country. The lawsuit alleges that the tech companies knowingly designed features such as auto play and infinite scroll to make their platforms addictive, leading to mental health issues.Google said in a media briefing last week that it expects the trial to last six to eight weeks. Jury selection could take up to a week, with opening statements beginning in early February. This trial is expected to draw some big names to the stand. In October, Judge Carolyn Kuhl ruled that Zuckerberg and Instagram chief Adam Mosseri will need to testify. Google said there is the potential for either CEO Sundar Pichai or YouTube CEO Neal Mohan to be called, however neither have been ordered yet.In its media briefing, Google said that it is not a social media platform in the same way that its co-defendants are. The company said that fundamentally it is a streaming platform and works with experts to build age-appropriate experiences.\"Providing young people with a safer, healthier experience has always been core to our work,\" a Google spokesperson said in a statement. \"The allegations in these complaints are simply not true.\"A Meta spokesperson pointed to a recent blog outlining its argument for the case, saying recent lawsuits misrepresent its commitment to creating safe and valuable experiences for young people.\"Protecting teens while allowing them to access the benefits of social media is one of the most important challenges our industry must address,\" the Meta blog says.TikTok did not respond to requests for comment.The potential damages and outcomes could be significant for all of the companies involved. While the three social giants are named as co-defendants, the judge could rule separately for each of them, handing down different penalties if found liable.Meta warned in an October filing that if found liable, the monetary damages from certain cases could be in the high tens of billions of dollars.Google says it expects any liabilities to be mostly monetary with limited injunctive relief. That means it is also possible the judge rules the platforms need to make algorithmic changes to its product features.-- CNBC's Julia Boorstin contributed to this reportWATCH: Here's what to watch from Big Tech earnings this week.",

    "body": "watch nowAs Meta tries to rapidly construct massive data centers to keep pace with the artificial intelligence craze, it's turning to a 175-year-old glass manufacturer for help.Meta has committed to paying Corning up to $6 billion through 2030 for fiber-optic cable in its AI data centers, Corning CEO Wendell Weeks told CNBC in an exclusive interview about the deal from a cable factory in Hickory, North Carolina.Corning is expanding the facility to accommodate growing demand from Meta and other big spenders like Nvidia, OpenAI, Google, Amazon and Microsoft as part of an extended industry buildout that's reaching into the trillions of dollars. When the project is complete, Corning says it will be the largest fiber-optic cable plant in the world.\"Almost every phone call I get from my customers is trying to see, how do we get them more?\" Weeks said. \"I think next year the hyperscalers will be our biggest customers.\"Shares of Corning, once a boom-and-bust dot-com era story, have risen more than 75% in the last year, with optical communications as the company's largest and fastest-growing business segment. Corning is among a wider swath of providers to the data center boom seeing historic levels of demand as the stack gets refreshed for the AI age. Meta's AI strategy, on the other hand, has puzzled Wall Street. The stock, which underperformed the market in 2025, had its worst day in three years in October after the company announced ambitious AI spending but without a clear monetization plan. The next month, Meta committed to spending $600 billion in the U.S. by 2028, on data centers and the infrastructure they require. Corning is part of that.Meta's plan for 30 data centers includes 26 facilities in the U.S. \"We want to have a domestic supply chain that's available to support that,\" Joel Kaplan, Meta's chief global affairs officer, said in an interview. In addressing concerns that China could win the AI race, Kaplan said, \"If we as a country don't make the right policy choices and the right investments, that's a real risk.\"Two of Meta's largest data centers currently under construction are its Prometheus one-gigawatt site in New Albany, Ohio, and five-gigawatt Hyperion site in Richland Parish, Louisiana. Both will include Corning fiber-optic cable as part of the new deal.Meta's 5-gigawatt \"Hyperion\" data center under construction in Richland Parish, Louisiana, on January 9, 2026.MetaHaving lived through a prior tech bubble, Corning is familiar with the narrative that's emerging in parts of the market, with skeptics questioning whether all of this building turns into new, sustainable businesses. AI announced more than $1 trillion in compute deals in 2025, leading some industry experts to predict a new bubble is forming. Fiber brought Corning huge success in the dot-com boom due to demand for communications equipment. The stock multiplied by about eightfold from the beginning of 1997 through its peak in September 2000, before losing over 90% of its value over a roughly two-year market collapse. \"What we learned then was that it wasn't enough to do great innovations,\" Weeks said.  With respect to the current data center buildout and the possibility of a slowdown, Weeks said fiber-optic demand has grown at about 7% annually on average, \"so we'll find a good use for it.\"He said he's also \"not concerned about Meta being successful in this space,\" because, \"In the end, really technical excellence, willingness to commit to the infrastructure, compute matters.\"'Built to withstand bad weather'Key to Corning's level of confidence is that its business is diversified with \"some more stable, high cash flow businesses in our mix.\"\"We're built to withstand bad weather,\" Weeks said.Meta Marshall, an analyst covering networking equipment at Morgan Stanley, said \"there is volatility on the fiber side,\" but that Corning can likely manage through it. \"The market will still need TVs and phones and cars and auto glass and vials for medications,\" said Marshall, who has the equivalent of a hold rating on the stock. Corning has had to re-invent itself time and again to get to this point.Founded in the gold rush era, the company built glass for Edison's light bulbs in the late 1870s, and over the following decades moved into Pyrex cookware, car filters, spacecraft windows, TV screens and vials for Covid vaccines. Since the launch of the iPhone in 2007, Apple has been a key customer, relying on Corning's glass for its flagship device. Apple announced a $2.5 billion deal in August, to manufacture all the cover glass for the iPhone and Apple Watch at a Corning plant in Harrodsburg, Kentucky.In 1970, Corning invented the first glass fiber that was useful for long-distance communication. Fiber-based broadband makes up the majority of the internet's backbone, with billions of miles of cable connecting continents, data centers, businesses and homes. Ultra-pure glass begins the process of being stretched into a hair-thin piece of fiber, melting and dropping down multiple stories from the furnace above, at Corning's fiber factory in Concord, North Carolina, on January 8, 2026.Magdalena PetrovaFiber can transmit data at nearly the speed of light. Unlike traditional copper phone lines that transmit information as electrical signals, fiber-optic cables are tiny bendable strands of glass through which data is sent as photons — lasers emitting pulses of light — at far higher speed, using less energy. \"Moving photons is between five and 20 times lower power usage than moving electrons,\" Weeks said. \"As power becomes a bigger and bigger issue, fiber inevitably gets closer and closer and closer to the compute.\" 'You need to put in a lot more capacity'Demand for Corning's fiber has skyrocketed of late in part because AI data centers require more fiber than traditional cloud computing infrastructure. Revenue in Corning's optical communications business, which includes fiber, jumped 33% in the third quarter to $1.65 billion, while total sales rose 14% to $4.27 billion. Corning said in its earnings release that enterprise sales of optical communications soared 58% in the quarter, \"driven by the continued strong adoption of Corning's new Gen AI products.\"Weeks described it as a \"whole separate network\" that's \"trying to create the connections just like it is between the neurons in your brain.\"All those connections require so much fiber that Corning invented a brand new type specifically for AI, called Contour. Weeks' name is on the patent. He showed CNBC the new cable that fits twice as many fiber strands into a standard size conduit, and reduces a set of 16 connectors down to a single one.Corning CEO Wendell Weeks showed CNBC Contour, it's new smaller, denser fiber-optic cable invented specifically for AI, in its cable factory in Hickory, North Carolina, on January 9, 2026.Magdalena PetrovaWeeks told CNBC development of the new AI products began more than five years ago, long before the 2022 debut of ChatGPT, following a conversation he had with a leader in generative AI.\"They were saying, 'Listen, you need to put in a lot more capacity,'\" Weeks recalled, without naming the person. \"He's like, 'No, you totally don't get it. This is what's going to happen and how much compute is going to be needed, how the scaling laws are working.'\"Mike O'Day, Corning's head of fiber optics, told CNBC that the company has now made over 1.3 billion miles of optical fiber. Weeks says 8 million miles will be needed in Meta's Louisiana data center alone. Keeping up with demand is Corning's current challenge.It may get even harder as fiber eventually replaces copper inside server racks like those used by Nvidia. Copper cables still dominate when it comes to connecting chips within a server, but Weeks says the change to fiber is \"inevitable\" once the number of graphics processors in each rack climbs into the hundreds.At that scale of connectivity, Weeks said, \"Fiber optics become much more economical and much more power efficient.\"Corning and Meta both report fourth-quarter earnings on Wednesday.Watch: Inside the world's largest fiber factory, where Corning is winning the AI infrastructure boomCNBC's Katie Tarasov tours Corning's largest fiber facility in the world with fiber optics business head Mike O'Day in Concord, North Carolina, on January 8, 2026.Magdalena Petrova",

The free trade agreement would see India reduce tariffs on European automobile and agricultural products, while the EU would do the same for Indian textiles, leather, marine products and gems and jewelry. Many of these Indian exports have been affected by the U.S. imposing 50% tariffs. \"We have created a free trade zone of 2 billion people, with both sides set to gain economically,\" said European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. She added that the deal sends \"a signal to the world that rules-based cooperation still delivers great outcomes\".The \"historic\" deal comes at a time when New Delhi is facing the brunt of U.S. tariffs and is looking at alternative markets for its exports. The EU's long-standing trade ties with the U.S., its largest trading partner, have been tested amid President Donald Trump's push to annex Greenland. India's Commerce and Industry Minister Piyush Goyal said in a press conference on Tuesday that he expected the deal would come into force in 2026.India is the EU's ninth-largest trading partner, accounting for 2.4% of the bloc's total trade in goods in 2024, far behind major partners like the U.S. (17.3%), China (14.6%), or the U.K. (10.1%). But the EU is one of India's largest trading partners, rivaling the U.S. and China.'The mother of all deals'Von der Leyen called it the \"mother of all deals.\"The deal would reduce India's tariffs on European products by around 4 billion euros ($4.7 billion) a year, the European Commission said in a release. The deal, which the EU expects will help it double its exports to India by 2032, will reduce tariffs on over 90% of European exports to India, such as autos, machinery, agri-food products, chemicals, and aircraft. \"India will grant the EU tariff reductions that none of its other trading partners have received, dramatically improving market access for EU exports,\" the European Commission said.A freight train carrying cargo containers rides along a railway track in Ajmer on August 26, 2025.     Himanshu Sharma | Afp | Getty ImagesNew Delhi has defied expectations of experts by offering to ease tariffs on sectors such as automotive and agriculture, which are particularly sensitive to the levies.India plans to reduce tariffs on European cars \"gradually\" from 110% to 10% and abolish duties on car parts after five to ten years. Some major European automobile companies in India include Renault, Volkswagen, BMW, and Mercedes.New Delhi has also nearly eliminated tariffs of up to 44% on machinery, 22% on chemicals and 11% on pharmaceuticals.The deal has also reduced or removed high tariffs on agricultural products exported from Europe such as wine and olive oil. It also keeps European agricultural sectors beef, chicken meat, rice and sugar protected from imports from India.\"Under this agreement, European wines, spirits, beers, olive oil, confectionary, and other products will enjoy preferential access to the rapidly growing Indian market,\" said Christophe Hansen, EU commissioner for agriculture and food.Indian auto stocks hitIn India, shares of major carmakers and alcoholic beverage companies plunged on the news of the deal.Shares of Japanese carmaker Maruti Suzuki ended 1.5% down, while those of Korean company Hyundai Motor India closed 3.6% lower. Indian automotive companies Tata Motors and Mahindra & Mahindra ended 1.3% and 4.2% lower, respectively.The Indian government has said the deal will give Indian consumers access to high-tech automobiles and greater competition.\"The reciprocal market access in EU market will also open up opportunities for India made automobiles to access the EU market,\" it said.Similarly, shares of India-based alcoholic beverage companies also fell. Shares of wine maker Sula Vineyards fell 4.1% while Heineken N.V.-owned United Breweries and Diageo-owned United Spirits fell over 2%.watch nowThe trade deal would lift levies on Indian sectors that have been hit by the 50% U.S. tariffs and provide New Delhi with \"preferential access to the European markets\" for more than 90% of its traded goods.Textiles, apparel, marine, leather, footwear, chemicals, plastics, sports goods, toys, gems, and jewelry will incur zero duty once the free trade agreement comes into force, India's commerce ministry said in a statement accompanying the announcement.These goods from these \"key labor-intensive sectors\" account for $33 billion in exports. Before the deal, the EU tariffed them at rates of between 4% to 26%.\"This should boost India's export competitiveness in these sectors, which are currently under strain due to higher US tariffs,\" said Sonal Varma, chief economist for India and Asia ex-Japan, at Nomura.Job creation in IndiaThe EU-India trade deal could create six or seven million jobs in the textile sector alone, Goyal told Tuesday's press conference, adding that the sector was the second-biggest employer in India after agriculture.India and the EU will put in place a framework to allow for temporary entry and stay for professionals, including business visitors, intra-corporate transferees, contractual service suppliers, and independent professionals.India's IT service sector, professional services, and education services are \"well-positioned\"  to benefit from the mobility provisions, Nomura's Varma said. In financial year 2025, India's bilateral trade in goods with the EU stood at 11.5 trillion rupees, or $136.54 billion), according to a release by India's commerce ministry. New Delhi's exports to Europe were $75.85 billion and imports were $60.68 billion, it said.",

    "body": "Maskot | Maskot | Getty ImagesEfforts in Congress to create a federal \"click to cancel\" rule — intended to make canceling subscriptions as easy as it is to sign up for them — have ramped up.A bipartisan House bill called the Unsubscribe Act was introduced in mid-January as a companion to a Senate measure proposed in July. Among other provisions, it would require companies that offer subscriptions to provide easy cancellations and to get consumers' approval before charging them after a free or reduced-cost period.The measure joins two other bills floated in July — one in each the House and Senate — that generally would reinstate a click-to-cancel rule from the Federal Trade Commission that didn't take effect last year as scheduled due to a federal appeals court striking it down.

Some economists disagreeCNBC's Financial Advisor 100: Best financial advisors, top firms rankedAlongside the congressional push, more than half of states now have some sort of law on the books that is similar in theme to the Unsubscribe Act and the FTC's rule, said Gonzalo Mon, a partner with the law firm of Kelley Drye & Warren in Washington.\"This does seem to be a bipartisan issue, and a lot of regulators are concerned about consumers getting into subscriptions without knowing all the details,\" Mon said.U.S. adults spend $1,080 yearly on subscriptionsSo-called \"negative option\" subscription contracts — those that automatically renew unless canceled by consumers — have generated a growing number of complaints over time as their prevalence and usage have increased. While these subscriptions are easy to sign up for, they can be difficult to cancel.In 2024, the FTC received an average of nearly 70 consumer complaints per day, up from 42 daily in 2021, according to the agency.Each year, U.S. adults spend an average of $1,080 on subscriptions, according to a 2025 survey by CNET, a media website focused on consumer technology. By generation, millennials spend the most annually: $1,215. The survey was conducted online in late April by YouGov and involved 2,440 adults.The average spent annually on subscriptions consumers no longer use is $205, according to the survey. Consumer groups push back against canceled FTC ruleThe FTC finalized its click-to-cancel rule in October 2024 under the Biden administration. It was quickly challenged in court by a range of business and trade groups, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the National Federation of Independent Businesses.About a week before the rule was scheduled to take effect last year on July 14, the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals vacated it on procedural grounds, \"not the merit of the rule,\" Mon said. Among the issues was that the FTC did not perform a proper economic impact analysis, Mon said.In November, two advocacy groups — the Consumer Federation of America and the American Economic Liberties Project — petitioned the FTC to renew the rulemaking process for the click-to-cancel rule.\"The American public continues to need robust protection against unfair and deceptive 'subscription traps' — the ubiquitous subscription practices that hook consumers into purchasing products or services with recurring charges and that are nearly impossible to cancel,\" the petition says.The FTC published the petition in the Federal Register on Dec. 3, with a public comment period lasting through Jan. 2.At this point, it's unclear whether the agency will restart the rulemaking process for its click-to-cancel rule.FTC's battle against cancellation practices continuesEither way, the FTC has continued to challenge subscription cancellation practices under a different authority, the Restore Online Shoppers' Confidence Act.In September, the FTC announced two settlements related to subscription cancellation practices. The agency reached a $2.5 billion settlement with Amazon over allegations that the company enrolled millions of consumers in Prime subscriptions without their consent and made it difficult for consumers to cancel.Separately, the agency reached a $7.5 million settlement with education-tech provider Chegg over allegations that it was difficult for consumers to cancel recurring subscriptions and that it failed to honor consumers' cancellation requests.Because companies offering subscriptions are likely to do business across the country, they are dealing with a patchwork of state laws that are not exactly identical.\"To the extent that companies are operating nationwide … they're figuring out what the most restrictive laws are and are tailoring their practices to those,\" Mon said.However, \"the Unsubscribe Act would not preempt state laws, so companies would have to comply with both\" federal and state laws, Mon said.It's uncertain whether the congressional proposals will gain traction or languish in committee.",

    "body": "President Donald Trump announced the creation of government-sponsored investment accounts for children under age 18 as part of the sweeping budget bill he signed into law on July 4, 2025. The so-called \"Trump accounts\" are set to become available on July 4, 2026, and parents of U.S. citizens born from 2025 through 2028 will be able to opt-in for an initial deposit of $1,000 from the federal government.Michael Dell, billionaire CEO of tech company Dell, and his wife, Susan, on Dec. 2 pledged a donation of $6.25 billion to provide an initial deposit of $250 to children ages 10 and under in certain ZIP codes when their families open an account on their behalf. Though Trump accounts are not explicitly designed for college savings, they will have similar benefits to 529 college savings plans. For example, Trump account beneficiaries may be able to use funds in the account for higher education expenses without early withdrawal penalties. However, when the beneficiaries turn 18, the accounts will be transferred into individual retirement accounts subject to IRA rules and tax advantages.Named for a section of the tax code, 529 plans were created in 1996 to help families save for their children's higher education expenses. The plans are state-sponsored investment accounts that can offer tax advantages like state income tax-deductible contributions and tax-free withdrawals for qualified expenses.\"Fundamentally, any way that people can save money is good, whether it's the 529 accounts or the Trump accounts or Roth IRAs or [Health Savings Accounts],\" Michael Green, a certified financial planner with Apollon Wealth, tells CNBC Make It. \"They're all good tools. It really comes down to what people are trying to accomplish and what their goal is, what their capacity to save is.\"While several details about Trump accounts are not yet available, the Internal Revenue Service has issued some guidance on how the accounts will function. Here are some of the key differences between Trump accounts and 529 savings plans.",

    "body": "Starbucks Workers United demonstrates outside of the Empire State Building as the union's strike enters its third week.CNBC | Amelia LucasNEW YORK — Starbucks Workers United held a rally outside the Empire State Building on Thursday as its open-ended strike entered its third week and no signs of an impending resolution.Adding to the crunch of holiday shoppers and tourists, several hundred picketers gathered outside of the famous landmark, which is also the site of a swanky three-floor Starbucks Reserve location and the company's regional headquarters. Members of other unions, like the AFL-CIO and Service Employees International Union, which is affiliated with Workers United, protested alongside baristas, chanting \"No coffee, no contract\" and \"What's disgusting? Union busting\" between speakers.\"Their fight is a fight really for all of us, to workers across the country, to corporations like Starbucks, across the country that workers are fed up with the status quo, and they're not going to take it anymore,\" SEIU President April Verrett told CNBC.Twelve demonstrators were arrested for blocking the building's entrance.Baristas launched the strike on Starbucks Red Cup Day last month, seeking new proposals from the company that address its top issues to finalize a contract. Those include improved hours, higher wages and the resolution of hundreds of unfair labor practice charges levied against Starbucks. Out of the 145 locations involved in the strike, 55 remain closed, according to a company spokesperson. The two parties have not been in active negotiations to reach a contract after talks between them fell apart late last year. The strikes have not changed that fact so far.While the strike has injected uncertainty into Starbucks' busy holiday season, the company has said its sales haven't been affected. CEO Brian Niccol told employees that Red Cup Day was its strongest in history. A successful holiday season will be key to the chain's turnaround under Niccol. Starbucks broke a nearly two-year streak of same-store sales declines in its most recently reported quarter. Past strikes have impacted less than 1% of its stores, the company said.The New York City rally comes after the company paid $38.9 million to settle violations of the city's Fair Workweek Law. Other large restaurant employers, like Chipotle, have previously run afoul of the law, which Starbucks said is \"notoriously challenging\" to navigate.The city's Department of Consumer and Worker Protection found Starbucks committed half a million violations of the law since 2021. The Fair Workweek law requires regular scheduling week to week, mandates schedules be provided 14 days in advance and says hours cannot be reduced by more than 15% without legitimate business reasons. DCWP Commissioner Vilda Vera Mayuga, who spoke at Thursday's rally, said the timing of the record-breaking settlement with the ongoing strike was coincidental.\"While the NYC laws remain unchanged and complex, our focus hasn't shifted – we're committed to creating the best job in retail and to ensuring our practices follow all laws,\" Starbucks said in a statement.The city's current Mayor Eric Adams and Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani have rallied behind striking workers. Mamdani joined Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., alongside baristas in Brooklyn earlier this week.Both Starbucks and the union have pointed blame at the other for failing to reach a bargaining agreement and maintain they are ready to speak when the other is. The two parties entered into mediation in February, and hundreds of barista delegates voted down the economic package Starbucks proposed in April. The company has said it is investing $500 million to improve the employee experience as part of its \"Back to Starbucks\" strategy. That investment includes upgrading its scheduling technology and adding more baristas to rosters. \"As we've said, 99% of our 17,000 U.S. locations remain open and welcoming customers —including many the union publicly stated would strike but never closed or have since reopened. Regardless of the union's plans, we do not anticipate any meaningful disruption. When the union is ready to return to the bargaining table, we're ready to talk,\" spokesperson Jaci Anderson said in a statement.",

    "body": "A sign at a NYS Department Of Labor job fair at the Downtown Central Library in Buffalo, New York, US, on Wednesday, Aug. 27, 2025.Lauren Petracca | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesAnnounced job cuts from U.S. employers moved further ahead of 1 million for the year in November as corporate restructuring, artificial intelligence and tariffs have helped pare job rolls, consulting firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas reported Thursday.The firm said layoff plans totaled 71,321 in November, a step down from the massive cuts announced in October but still enough to bring the 2025 total up to 1.17 million. That total is 54% higher than the same 11-month period a year ago and the highest level since 2020, when the Covid pandemic rocked the global economy.In November, Verizon's announcement that it would slash more than 13,000 jobs helped drive the total. Tech companies, driven by innovations in artificial intelligence, listed 12,377 reductions, pushing the sector's 2025 total up 17% from a year ago. AI itself has been cited for 54,694 layoffs this year.Tariffs were cited as the driver of more than 2,000 cuts in November and nearly 8,000 year to date. The most-cited reason for the month was restructuring, followed by closings and market or economic conditions.\"Layoff plans fell last month, certainly a positive sign. That said, job cuts in November have risen above 70,000 only twice since 2008: in 2022 and in 2008,\" said Andy Challenger, workplace expert and chief revenue officer at Challenger, Gray & Christmas.Challenger also pointed out that since the financial crisis in 2008, companies have shifted away from end-year layoff announcements.\"It was the trend to announce layoff plans toward the end of the year, to align with most companies' fiscal year-ends. It became unpopular after the Great Recession especially, and best practice dictated layoff plans would occur at times other than the holidays,\" said Challenger.November offered some relief from the more than 153,000 cuts announced in October, which was the highest total for the month in 22 years.The numbers come with concerns rising over the state of the U.S. labor market.ADP reported Wednesday that private employers cut 32,000 jobs in November, the biggest decline in more than 2½ years.Hiring prospects have been dim this year as well, according to the Challenger report. Employers have announced 497,151 planned hires, off 35% from the same point in 2024.Despite signs of weakness elsewhere, Labor Department data has yet to reflect a surge in layoffs. The department on Thursday reported that weekly jobless claims unexpectedly tumbled to 191,000, the lowest in more than three years. Official data showed the decline of some 27,000 from the prior week was driven by unusually large drops in California and Texas and likely was influenced by the Thanksgiving holiday.",

    "body": "An Ulta Beauty store in Concord, California, US, on Wednesday, Dec. 3, 2025. David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesUlta Beauty on Thursday raised its full-year sales outlook after topping Wall Street's fiscal third-quarter expectations and seeing shoppers splurge on perfumes, skincare items and more.The beauty retailer said it now expects net sales for the year to be approximately $12.3 billion, higher than its previous expectations of $12 billion to $12.1 billion. That would would represent an increase from last fiscal year's net sales of $11.3 billion. It expects earnings per share of $25.20 to $25.50, up from its prior expectations of $23.85 to $24.30.It anticipates comparable sales, a metric that includes sales at stores open at least 14 months and e-commerce sales, to rise by 4.4% to 4.7%, up from its prior outlook of 2.5% to 3.5%. Ulta has raised its sales and profit outlook for two consecutive quarters. The company's stock rose more than 6% in extended trading.In a news release, CEO Kecia Steelman said \"exciting assortment newness, improved in-store and digital experiences, and bold marketing efforts are resonating with our guests and drove strong sales results.\"On the company's earnings call, she said that Ulta is \"pleased with our Black Friday and Cyber Monday performance\" and ready for the shopping season — even one when consumers may be more selective about spending.\"Our insights suggest beauty consumers' budgets are tight and they are focused on value,\" she said. \"Despite this, beauty enthusiasts tell us that they spend intend to spend on beauty for seasonal needs, affordable splurges and gifts for loved ones. They are focused on replenishing their essentials and strategically making smart purchases around strong value.\"Here's what the retailer reported for the fiscal third quarter compared with what Wall Street expected, according to LSEG:Earnings per share: $5.14 vs. $4.64 expectedRevenue: $2.86 billion vs. $2.72 billion expectedUlta has benefitted from shoppers who have kept spending on beauty, even as they trim the budget or seek out lower-priced options in other discretionary categories. Yet the company faces stiffer competition from a wide range of rivals, including big-box retailers like Walmart, online players like Amazon and upstarts like TikTok Shop. Beauty sales have been strong overall this year in the U.S., according to data from market research firm Circana. In the first nine months of 2025, prestige beauty sales in terms of dollars rose 4% and mass beauty sales rose 5% year over year.According to Circana, beauty is poised to be a popular category during the holidays, with the market researcher's surveys indicating that more consumers plan to gift beauty products than a year ago, particularly those in households with higher-incomes and those with children.Revenue rose from $2.53 billion in the year-ago quarter.Comparable sales jumped by 6.3% year over year. Shoppers visited Ulta's stores and websites more and spent more during visits. Average ticket rose 3.8% and transactions increased by 2.4% year over year.In the three-month period that ended Nov. 1, Ulta reported net income of $230.9 million, or $5.14 per share, compared with $242.2 million, or $5.14 per share, in the year-ago quarter.Though consumer confidence is weak, Steelman said on Ulta's earnings call that \"beauty engagement remained healthy.\" She said sales of both mass and prestige beauty items grew by mid single-digits year over year.Fragrance was its strongest category in the quarter, with double-digit sales growth year over year, as shoppers bought luxury scents from Valentino and Dolce & Gabbana and also lower-priced scents like Squishmallows perfumes.Steelman said that in October, Ulta added more shelf space for fragrance in more than 60% of its U.S. stores to try to get ready for higher demand during the holidays and beyond.In skincare, the retailer's second-fastest growing category, sales grew by high single digits year over year, she said. Shoppers bought items they discovered on social media, including Korean or K-beauty brands and purchased merchandise from Rihanna's Fenty Skin Body collection, which launched in the fall.To drive growth, Ulta has also been expanding internationally and launched a third-party marketplace in October. In July, it announced it had acquired Space NK, a British beauty retailer, from Manzanita Capital. The deal allows Ulta to enter a new international market, since Space NK has 83 stores in the United Kingdom and Ireland.During the third quarter, Ulta opened seven stores in Mexico through its joint venture partnership with Grupo Bakso. It opened its first Ulta store in the Middle East in Kuwait last month through a franchise partnership with Al-Shabaab.Through its marketplace, Ulta has added more than 120 brands and over 3,500 unique items to its online assortment, Steelman said. She said the company is \"pleased with the initial performance and optimistic about how this new capability can help us strengthen our existing category, attract new guests, and capitalize on incremental growth opportunities in new subcategories,\" such as wellness. Higher tariffs have influenced some of the prices of items carried by Ulta, too. The company saw more brand-driven price increases in the third quarter than the second quarter, interim Chief Financial Officer Chris Lialios said. Sales in the haircare category grew by mid single-digits, despite a sales decline in personal styling tools that have felt pressure from tariff-related price increases, Steelman said.Ulta announced in October that Christopher DelOrefice, the chief financial officer of medical technology company Becton Dickinson & Company, will become its new CFO. He will start in the role on Dec. 5.As of Thursday's close, Ulta's shares have risen about 23% so far this year. That surpasses the S&P 500's nearly 17% gains during the same period.",

    "body": "The New York Times building is seen on September 16, 2025 in New York City. Michael M. Santiago | Getty ImagesThe New York Times on Thursday filed a lawsuit challenging new restrictions on reporters who cover the Pentagon, which the newspaper says violate the U.S Constitution's free press protections.The suit against the Defense Department and Secretary Pete Hegseth comes nearly two months after reporters from The Times and other mainstream news outlets, including CBS, CNN, Fox News, and NBC staged a dramatic walkout of the Pentagon and surrendered their credentials after refusing to comply with the rules. Those outlets have been replaced by reporters who are broadly sympathetic to the Trump administration.The Pentagon in October presented reporters who had desks there a 21-page rulebook that bars journalists from seeking or publishing information that has not been explicitly authorized by the Defense Department, even if the material is unclassified or obtained off Pentagon grounds.Outlets that refused to abide by the rules lost their Pentagon credentials.The Times' lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C., asks a judge to block the Pentagon from enforcing the policy, and to declare it unconstitutional. \"The policy, in violation of the First Amendment, seeks to restrict journalists' ability to do what journalists have always done — ask questions of government employees and gather information to report stories that take the public beyond official pronouncements,\" the suit says.The rules \"deprive the public of vital information about the United States military and its leadership,\" the suit says.The complaint also says that the Defense Department gave itself \"unbridled discretion\" to enforce the rules as it sees fit.Chief Pentagon Spokesman Sean Parnell, who is named as a defendant in the suit, told CNBC that the Defense Department \"is aware of the New York Times lawsuit and [looks] forward to addressing these arguments in court.\" The Times did immediately return a request for comment.The Pentagon's media rules were the latest step in Hegseth's broader push to reshape the press corps. Since arriving at the department in January after a contentious confirmation fight, Hegseth has stripped several national outlets of in-house workspaces, tightened rules on where reporters can move inside the building, and reassigned offices to conservative outlets and pro-Trump media figures willing to sign the agreement.Press-freedom advocates, including the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, say the Pentagon policy goes beyond past fights over individual White House press badges. Rather than targeting one reporter at a time, they argue, the rules bind the entire press corps — giving the Pentagon broad authority to revoke access based on the stories they pursue.\"The Pentagon's press access policy is unlawful because it gives government officials unchecked power over who gets a credential and who doesn't, something the First Amendment prohibits,\" Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press Vice President of Policy Gabe Rottman said in a statement Thursday, after the Times filed its suit.",

    "body": "U.S. Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. looks on as he attends a press conference to discuss health insurance reform, at the Department of Health and Human Services in Washington, D.C., U.S., June 23, 2025.Kevin Mohatt | ReutersHealth and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s hand-picked vaccine committee on Thursday deferred crucial votes on hepatitis B vaccines for babies until Friday, saying it will give members more time to review proposed language on the measure. One panel member, Dr. Cody Meissner, a professor of pediatrics at the Dartmouth Geisel School of Medicine, brought a motion to defer the votes following confusion amongst the group about the language. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention currently recommends that every baby get vaccinated against hepatitis B within 24 hours of birth. It's unclear if the panel, called the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, or ACIP, could significantly delay or eliminate a so-called birth dose of the shot for babies whose mothers test negative for the virus. The group tabled a vote on the vaccine in September because some members called for a more robust discussion first.But any change could have wide-ranging consequences: Some public health experts say that having fewer newborns vaccinated against the virus could risk an increase in chronic infections among children. Hepatitis B, which can be passed from mother to baby during childbirth, can lead to liver disease and early death. There is no cure. \"We have a vaccine that is highly effective at preventing an incurable disease. We should take full advantage of that,\" Neil Maniar, a public health professor at Northeastern University, told CNBC. The birth dose recommendation was introduced in 1991 and is credited with driving down infections in kids by 99% since then. Maniar called that a \"remarkable success story that we run the risk of reversing\" if the committee changes the recommendation. Decisions by the panel are not legally binding, as it is up to states to mandate immunizations. But ACIP's recommendations have significant implications for whether private insurance plans and government assistance programs cover the vaccines at no cost for eligible children. The panel's upcoming two-day meeting in Atlanta comes after Kennedy earlier this year gutted the committee and appointed 12 new members, including some well-known vaccine critics. During the meeting in September, some advisors raised questions about whether the benefits of the shot outweigh potential safety risks. But the jab is \"an incredibly safe vaccine with minimal risks,\" Dr. Sean O'Leary, chair of the American Academy of Pediatrics' Committee on Infectious Diseases, said during a media briefing Tuesday. \"I never once saw a fever actually associated with hepatitis B vaccine,\" said O'Leary, who practiced for eight years as a general pediatrician and worked in a newborn nursery. The AAP, which publishes its own vaccine schedule, still recommends the universal birth dose of the hepatitis B vaccine because \"it saves lives,\" he added. A new review, published Tuesday, of more than 400 studies spanning four decades also found no evidence that delaying the universal hepatitis B vaccine birth dose improves safety or effectiveness. The review also found that the birth dose does not cause any short- or long-term serious adverse events or deaths.A 2024 CDC study showed that the current vaccination schedule has helped prevent more than 6 million hepatitis B infections and nearly 1 million hepatitis B-related hospitalizations.Merck and GSK manufacture the hepatitis B vaccines used starting at birth. Neither of the shots are significant revenue drivers for the companies. But John Grabenstein, a former Merck vaccine executive and military pharmacist, said a change to the recommendation could cause vaccine supply disruptions for the companies. \"They have build up their reserves, and they build up their thorough calculations so that they can meet the status quo,\" Grabenstein, who has no remaining financial ties to Merck, told CNBC. \"If you disrupt the status quo without warning, then there would be too much of some things and not enough of other things that could easily create spot shortages.\" Still, he said his first concern from a public health standpoint is that fewer children will get vaccinated on time, leaving them vulnerable to infection. Merck during the panel's September meeting also pushed back on changing the recommendation. \"The reconsideration of the newborn Hepatitis B vaccination on the established schedule poses a grave risk to the health of children and to the public, which could lead to a resurgence of preventable infectious diseases,\" Dr. Richard Haupt, Merck's head of global medical and scientific affairs for vaccines and infectious diseases, said at the time. ",

    "body": "Refreshed versions of the Tesla Model Y are shown outside a Tesla store in San Diego, California, U.S. October 21, 2025. Mike Blake | ReutersDETROIT — U.S. electric vehicle sales leader Tesla made notable strides in Consumer Reports' influential annual auto brand rankings, cracking the top 10 overall for the U.S.The EV manufacturer jumped from No. 18 on last year's list of more than 30 automotive brands to 10th on the 2026 Consumer Reports Brand Report Card, which was released Thursday.\"They definitely have their struggles, but by continuing to refine and not make huge changes in their models, they're able to make more reliable vehicles, and they've moved up our rankings,\" Jake Fisher, senior director of auto testing for Consumer Reports, told CNBC.The annual auto brand report card is based on Consumer Reports' testing as well as reliability, safety and overall customer satisfaction according to owner surveys.The surveys do not reflect broader consumer sentiment about the models or automakers ranked by CR outside of customer satisfaction. Tesla has faced a consumer backlash against CEO Elon Musk in response to his work with the Trump administration and endorsements of far-right politicians and personalities around the world, including Germany's extreme anti-immigrant party AfD. Fisher said Tesla's gain occurred as its vehicles have become more reliable over time, especially as the company hasn't made significant design changes to many of its vehicles like traditional automakers tend to do. Tesla instead relies on remote, or over-the-air, updates to revise many features on the vehicles. Its powertrain reliability remains a standout among EVs, according to Consumer Reports.The only Tesla model to have a below-average score is the Cybertruck, its newest model that features a host of new technologies such as a 48-volt architecture system and \"steer by wire.\" A Tesla Cybertruck in front of a graffiti mural on Aug. 28, 2024 in Detroit. Michael Wayland / CNBC\"They're definitely improving by keeping with things and refining, but if you look at their 5- to 10-year-old models that are out there, when it comes to reliability, they're dead last of all the brands,\" Fisher said. \"They're able to improve the reliability if they don't make major changes.\"On the other end of report card, Rivian Automotive moved up five spots to No. 26 but remains near the bottom of the rankings. Fisher said Rivian models are the lowest in reliability.Despite Rivian's reliability issues, the brand has the highest owner satisfaction, according to Consumer Reports. Fisher during an Automotive Press Association webinar Thursday said its owners are largely early adopters that are willing to deal with some growing pains likely more than more mainstream consumers would. Brands with good reliability tend to perform well in the overall rankings. Reliability for new 2026 models is predicted based on each model's overall reliability for the past three years, provided that the model hasn't been redesigned during that time.Subaru topped the overall 2026 brand list, followed by BMW, Porsche, Honda and Toyota to round out the top five brands. At the bottom of the rankings were Jeep, Land Rover, GMC, Dodge and Alfa Romeo.Ford Motor's Lincoln, the highest-ranked domestic brand, made the biggest jump in this year's rankings, climbing 17 positions to No. 7 due to its reliability scores. Audi dropped the most from last year, falling back 10 spots to No. 16.Traditional U.S. automakers, specifically Stellantis brands, struggled compared with their Asian competition in Consumer Reports' annual brand reliability rankings.Of note, the Ford brand ranked No. 18 in the report card but saw improvement in reliability. The automaker, which has struggled with quality issues and recalls, had its Ford brand rank No. 11 in reliability — its best position in 15 years.GM's top-ranked brand was Cadillac at No. 17, followed by Buick at No. 20, Chevrolet at No. 24 and GMC at 29th.Consumer Reports said hybrid vehicles, which are growing in popularity, continue to stand out over other \"electrified\" vehicles, as well as traditional vehicles with internal combustion engines.Of approximately 30 hybrids analyzed by Consumer Reports, only the Hyundai Sonata Hybrid, Lincoln Nautilus Hybrid and Mazda CX-50 Hybrid have below-average predicted reliability scores.— CNBC's Lora Kolodny contributed to this article.",

David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesApple's general counsel, Kate Adams, and its vice president for environment, policy, and social initiatives, Lisa Jackson, are retiring from the company, the iPhone maker announced on Thursday. Jennifer Newstead, Meta's chief legal officer, will become Apple's new general counsel in March, and Jackson's government affairs staff will report to her starting late next year, Apple said. The two executives, who both reported to Apple CEO Tim Cook, are the latest members of senior leadership to exit the company. In recent weeks, Apple's head software designer said he was leaving to join Meta, while Apple said its AI chief was retiring, along with its chief operating officer.Adams joined Apple from Honeywell and became general counsel in 2017, and oversaw legal matters including litigation, global security, and the company's privacy initiatives. Under Adams, Apple grappled with rising antitrust scrutiny and regulation around the world, including major lawsuits in the U.S. over the iPhone App Store's restrictions and fees. Jackson joined Apple in 2013, and led the company's diversity programs as well as much of its policy work in Washington, D.C. Before that, she spent four years as administrator of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, a position she was appointed to by President Barack Obama. With her emphasis in areas like social justice and renewable energies, Jackson's job lost relevance during the second Trump administration, which has publicly denounced diversity, equity and inclusion programs and slammed efforts to combat climate change. Apple has faced increased tariffs from the Trump administration, and Cook has met with President Donald Trump several times to tout the company's American manufacturing plans as part of an effort to influence policy. Jackson was instrumental in Apple's launch of its Racial Equity and Justice Initiative following the 2020 murder of George Floyd. She then helped expand the company's equity and justice efforts to other countries, including the U.K., Mexico and New Zealand, according to a report published in 2023.\"At Apple, we pledge that our resolve will not fade,\" Jackson wrote in a section of that report. \"We won't delay action. We will work, each and every day, on the urgent task of advancing equity.\"Jackson also worked on Apple's environmental image. Her job \"focused on reducing greenhouse gases, protecting air and water quality, preventing exposure to toxic contamination, and expanding outreach to communities on environmental issues,\" according to her bio on the company's website. She discussed Apple's plans to become carbon neutral at iPhone launch events.Jackson also accompanied Cook to several official functions in Washington, including state dinners. Apple CEO Tim Cook and Apple Vice President Lisa Jackson arrive at the White House for a state dinner on April 10, 2024 in Washington, DC. Tasos Katopodis | Getty ImagesNewstead, who will become Apple's top lawyer, has overseen Meta's legal and regulatory matters pertaining to its family of apps like Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp since 2019. A Meta spokesperson said Newstead will be staying through the end of the year and that the company is actively searching for her replacement.Prior to Meta, Newstead served as a Trump-appointed legal advisor at the State Department during the president's first administration in 2019.  Before that, she was a partner at Davis Polk & Wardwell and a general counsel of the White House Office of Management and Budget, among other roles in the U.S. government.CNBC's Jonathan Vanian contributed to this story.WATCH: Apple AI chief steps downwatch now",

    "body": "The Reserve Bank of India logo outside its headquarters in Mumbai on Feb. 7, 2025. Indranil Mukherjee | Afp | Getty ImagesIndia's central bank on Friday cut its policy rate by 25 basis points to 5.25%, matching forecasts from economists polled by Reuters. The monetary policy committee delivered a unanimous reduction, citing \"weakness in some key economic indicators,\" even as headline inflation has eased significantly and is expected to be revised lower in the first quarter of 2025, said RBI governor Sanjay Malhotra.The economy expanded 8.2% from July to September, outpacing expectations, while inflation remains subdued.\"Despite an unfavorable and challenging external environment, the Indian economy has shown remarkable resilience,\" Malhotra said, noting signs of \"high growth.\"\"The headroom provided by the inflation outlook has allowed us to remain growth supportive. We will continue to meet productive requirements of the economy in a proactive manner,\" he said in his closing remarks.Rupee weaknessThe central bank on Friday said it will buy 1 trillion rupees ($11 billion) of government bonds on the open market and carry out a three-year, $5 billion buy-sell swap of the U.S. dollar and the Indian rupee this month.These steps will \"ensure adequate durable liquidity in the system and further facilitate monetary transmission\", Malhotra said.The RBI routinely carries out dollar-rupee swaps to offset the liquidity effects of its spot market interventions on the rupee. The Indian rupee has weakened against the dollar in recent days, slipping past the important 90-rupee-per-dollar level on Wednesday before paring losses.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconIndia's foreign exchange reserves on Nov. 28 stood at $686.2 billion, providing more than 11 months of import cover, the central bank said in a statement.Today's rate cut is \"timely\" given that the economy is doing well, but the outlook remains uncertain, said Anubhuti Sahay, head of India economics research at Standard Chartered Bank. She added that the rate cut is even more significant given the rupee's weakness.Given the sharp moves in the exchange rate, had the RBI not delivered a rate cut today, \"one couldn't have ruled out the possibility of a sell-off in the bond market,\" Sahay added, which would not have been desirable from the RBI's point of view.Weak data, strong growthRBI's Malhotra, explaining the rationale for keeping rates unchanged at the last policy meeting in October, warned that although inflation moderated significantly in the first quarter, growth could still slow in the second half of the financial year due to global trade uncertainties.Concerns about the slowdown in growth are showing up in key economic indicators. Industrial activity in October fell to a 14-month low, and indicators such as HSBC's manufacturing PMI fell to a nine-month low in November, suggesting an economic slowdown.Exports to the U.S., one of India's major trading partners, fell for a second straight month in October, sliding 8.5% from a year earlier to $6.3 billion. Overall outbound shipments in October also fell 11.8% to $34.38 billion.\"External uncertainties continue to pose downside risks to the [growth] outlook, while speedy conclusion of various ongoing trade and investment negotiations present upside potential,\" the governor said.watch nowWashington has imposed a 50% tariff on Indian goods since August. While trade negotiations are ongoing between the two countries, a deal has yet to be finalized.To offset the impact of the tariffs, New Delhi cut goods and services tax rates in September ahead of a month-long festive season to lift domestic demand. GST tax collections showed a sharp improvement in October to 1.95 trillion rupees ($21.7 billion), up 4.6% from a year earlier, but the growth was muted in November with gross collection of 1.7 trillion rupees, a modest 0.7% increase.The Indian rupee has weakened against the dollar in recent days, slipping past the important 90-rupee-per-dollar level on Wednesday before paring losses.Despite a policy rate cut earlier this year, there has not been a \"major pick up in bank lending,\" said Sanjay Mathur, ANZ's Chief Economist for India and Southeast Asia. He added that while there is also no clarity on the conclusion of a U.S.-India trade deal, the impact of tariffs is visible on the economy. ",

    "body": "Justin Tallis | Afp | Getty ImagesBitcoin's more than 30% drop from its record high underscores the volatility that has come to  characterize the cryptocurrency.Moves from previous cycles not only show how the current price swings are all part of bitcoin's normal operating pattern but also how they may often precede a rally, according to figures compiled by CoinDesk Data for CNBC.Bitcoin, the world's largest cryptocurrency, dropped to a low of around $80,000 late last month before staging a rally and falling again this week. When bitcoin dropped to under $81,000, that represented an approximately 36% fall from its all-time high of around $126,000 hit earlier in October. As of Thursday, bitcoin was trading at over $93,000, according to Coinmetrics, a roughly 26% decline from its record high.These price swings may seem large but they are normal in relation to bitcoin's history.Bitcoin's price movement is often referred to in \"cycles.\" Generally, the bitcoin cycle refers to a four-year pattern of price movement that revolves around a key event known as the halving, a change to mining rewards that is written in bitcoin's code. While there are signs that the typical timing and patterns of the cycles could be changing, the range of price movements appears to be consistent.In the current cycle, bitcoin has already weathered a 32.7% pullback from March to August 2024 and a 31.7% decline between January and April 2025, according to CoinDesk Data. \"Looking at previous cycles, volatility of this magnitude appears consistent with long-term trends,\" Jacob Joseph, senior research analyst at CoinDesk Data, told CNBC.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconBitcoin's ups and downs can be seen across its history.During the 2017 cycle, there were drawdowns of around 40% twice that year and then a 29% decline in November before bitcoin reached a new record high in December. Looking back at the 2021 cycle, bitcoin recorded declines of 31.2% in January that year and 26% in February. There was a more than 55% correction between April and June 2021 as China banned bitcoin mining. The asset then rallied to a new high in November that year.\"While deeper mid-cycle corrections have certainly occurred, nearly all of them — aside from the mining-ban-drop in 2021 —  took place within a broader bullish structure, often holding above key technical levels such as its 50-week moving average,\" Joseph said.What has driven market moves?Beginning Oct. 10, more than 1.6 million traders suffered a combined $19.37 billion erasure of leveraged positions over a 24-hour period. Many traders were forced out of their positions and the impact of that cascaded across the industry.That effect is still being felt, according to Lucy Gazmararian, founder of Token Bay Capital.\"[It was the] biggest liquidation event in crypto's history and that takes quite a few weeks to see the fallout from that and for the market to consolidate,\" Gazmararian told \"Access Middle East\" on Thursday.\"It also coincided at a time when there's a lot of concern that we are reaching the end of a bull market … so that has increased the levels of fear out there in the market.\"watch nowIn the past, when the bull market ends and there is a period of depressed prices, often dubbed a \"crypto winter,\" bitcoin has tended to sit 70% to 80% below its all-time high. This has not yet happened. But concern about this coming to pass is weighing on investors' minds.\"Really the timing of the drop, where we are in the cycle, that's making investors cautious in case we do see that 80% drop,\" Gazmararian said.",

Grogan | CNBCSoFi shares fell almost 6% in extended trading Thursday after the fintech company announced a $1.5 billion stock offering. The company, which provides online loans and other banking services, said in a press release that it will use the proceeds for \"general corporate purposes, including but not limited to enhancing capital position, increasing optionality and enabling further efficiency of capital management, and funding incremental growth and business opportunities.\"The announced offering comes after SoFi's market cap almost doubled so far in 2025. The stock price is up more than sixfold since the end of 2022. A company's share price often drops on a planned share sale as the offering dilutes the value of existing holders' stakes. In its third-quarter earnings release in late October, SoFi reported revenue growth of 38% from a year earlier to $961.6 million, while net income more than doubled to $139.4 million. The company reported cash and equivalents of $3.25 billion.WATCH: SoFi CEO on launch of crypto tradingwatch now",

Mustafa Yalcin | Anadolu | Getty ImagesBeta Technologies posted its first quarterly results on Thursday since the stock debuted on the New York Stock Exchange.The electric aircraft maker, which went public last month, reported revenue of $8.9 million, more than double the $3.1 million from a year ago.\"As a newly public company, we remain firmly grounded in what makes BETA unique—our simple, stepwise approach, our vertical integration and our focus on designing and manufacturing the complete electric aviation ecosystem to meet the needs of customers around the world,\" CEO Kyle Clark said in a statement.Net loss widened to $452 million, a loss of $9.83 per share, from a loss of $82.1 million, a loss of $1.81 per share, in the year-ago period.The company said the net loss took a hit from the issuance of convertible preferred stock.Beta forecasted full-year revenue to reach between $29 million and $33 million and adjusted EBITDA to range between a loss of $295 million and a loss of $325 million.The Amazon-backed company is establishing itself as another player alongside rivals Joby Aviation and Archer Aviation in the small but competitive electric vertical take-off and landing, or eVTOL, space.Air taxi manufacturers are vying to gain approval from the Federal Aviation Administration, which launched the eVTOL Integration Pilot Program, or eIPP, in September.Read more CNBC tech newsNvidia has a cash problem -- too much of itMeta faces Europe antitrust investigation over WhatsApp AI policyNvidia CEO Jensen Huang talks chip restrictions with Trump, blasts state-by-state AI regulationsDesign executive behind 'Liquid Glass' is leaving AppleClark told CNBC that the program is a \"massive testament\" to the Trump administration's efforts in accelerating the nascent industry. Beta is applying to the program with state partners, including North Carolina, Michigan and Ohio, to host its commercial aircraft operations as soon as next June.\"We have flown more than twice as many miles than anybody else in this industry,\" Clark said. \"That real-world flying gives us the ability to go into these eIPP opportunities with a mature type of certification product with a ton of reliability.\"The company is currently working on military and cargo operations before focusing on passenger applications. During the quarter, aircraft engine supplier GE Aerospace agreed to invest $300 million in Beta and co-develop a hybrid electric turbogenerator for both defense and civil use.\"The eIPP program is meant to augment America's drone dominance and that is a military interest as well as a civil interest,\" Clark said. \"Partnership with dual-use aircraft like ours, with the military and civil applications, is a big part of this.\"The company also worked with Hartzell Propeller to land certification during the quarter, becoming the first FAA-certified propeller specifically designed for advanced air mobility aircraft. The achievement marks another step closer to obtaining Type Certification, or approval of aircraft design, for Beta's H500A electric engine.\"To take something as big and new as a primary propulsion electric motor that other people are buying, that we're using in our own aircraft — we're flying all over the world in — and be in the final steps to Type Certification is a huge validation point,\" Clark said. Beta announced earlier this week an up to supply deal with air taxi company Eve Air Mobility.Eve agreed to purchase Beta's electric pusher motors, which could potentially equate to as much as $1 billion over 10 years. Clark said during an earnings call that the deal contributed to a component backlog of over $1 billion.",

    "body": "Jonathan Raa | Nurphoto | Getty ImagesChip giant Nvidia (NVDA) is considered to be one of the key beneficiaries of the artificial intelligence boom, thanks to robust demand for its advanced graphics processing units (GPUs). The stock has been under pressure recently due to concerns about valuations of AI plays and growing competition in the AI chip space from rivals like Broadcom (AVGO), Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) and Alphabet-owned Google's tensor processing units (TPUs). Nvidia is also facing uncertainty related to chip exports to China amid geopolitical tensions between Washington and Beijing. Despite ongoing pressures, several top analysts remain bullish on Nvidia for several reasons, including its solid track record, strong execution, continued innovation and dominant position in the AI GPU market. TipRanks' AI Analyst also has an \"outperform\" rating on NVDA stock with a price target of $205.Let's look at the views of three such Wall Street pros who are bullish on Nvidia's growth potential. Vivek Arya – Bank of AmericaFollowing a virtual meeting with Nvidia's vice president of investor relations, Toshiya Hari, Bank of America analyst Vivek Arya reiterated a buy rating on NVDA stock with a price forecast of $275, saying that he continues to view it as a top pick.Among the key takeaways, Arya mentioned that while Nvidia agrees that Gemini 3 is a top large language model (LLM) that is trained on Google's in-house TPU, the company contends that it is too early to declare a clear winner. Specifically, the company emphasized that the existing GPU-based LLMs available were all trained on old Hopper (2022) architecture and cannot be compared with the upcoming LLMs that are trained on NVDA's Blackwell (2024) GPUs.Arya highlighted that management is confident about the expected launch of the Blackwell-backed LLMs in early 2026, which would prove that \"they are at least a full generation ahead of competition.\" In fact, external benchmarks like MLPerf and InferenceMAX view Blackwell as the clear leader in both training and inference, with Nvidia standing out in terms of key metrics like tokens per watt and revenue per token.The five-star analyst added that Nvidia continues to have demand and supply visibility into at least $500 billion of revenue opportunity for Blackwell, Rubin and networking for calendar years 2025 to 2026. Interestingly, the recent deals with ChatGPT maker OpenAI and Anthropic/Microsoft are incremental to this $500 billion outlook (as they are letter of intents) and represent potential upside.Overall, the meeting reinforced Arya's bullish thesis, with the analyst finding NVDA stock's valuation attractive. Specifically, its price-to-earnings (P/E) multiples of 25x and 19x of 2026 and 2027 earnings, respectively, imply only a 0.5x PEG ratio. That's compared to the average of 2x for the Magnificent Seven stocks and growth competitors.Arya ranks No. 270 among more than 10,100 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been profitable 58% of the time, delivering an average return of 17.7%. Stacy Rasgon – BernsteinBernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon is also upbeat about Nvidia's prospects and has a buy rating on the semiconductor stock with a price target of $275. In his latest note to investors, the analyst discussed some interesting takeaways from his virtual investor meeting with Stewart Stecker, senior director of investor relations at Nvidia.Rasgon noted that the $500 billion outlook announced in October for cumulative Blackwell, Rubin and networking sales for calendar years 2025 and 2026 will likely see an upside, as it doesn't include new deals such as that with Anthropic, the OpenAI 10 GW collaboration, and partnerships in the Middle East.On concerns about competition from Google's in-house chips, Rasgon noted that while Nvidia acknowledges the progress that Google has made in more than 10 years, the company believes that it is about two years ahead of the search engine giant's TPU program.Nvidia argues that, given the evolving AI market, it will be challenging for Google to persuade cloud service providers to deploy TPUs as they are meant for specific model structures. \"But they believe NVIDIA's programmable platform solutions remain the best hardware for cloud AI infrastructure,\" said Rasgon.Regarding President Donald Trump's recent post about allowing Nvidia to ship H200 AI chips to China, subject to a 25% cut that goes to the U.S., Rasgon noted that Nvidia is still waiting to secure licenses to ship H200s, after which it intends to look into demand requests and commence manufacturing. Moreover, Nvidia has not yet obtained any details about the 25% revenue sharing with the U.S. government and is currently unclear about how this fee will be accounted for.Rasgon ranks No. 144 among more than 10,100 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been successful 67% of the time, delivering an average return of 27.3%. Blayne Curtis – JefferiesIn a research note on the 2026 outlook for semiconductors, Jefferies analyst Blayne Curtis reaffirmed a buy rating on Nvidia stock with a price target of $250. Curtis called Broadcom (AVGO) as the top pick, citing ASIC (application-specific integrated circuits) inflection and the highest level of estimate revisions expected for the company in the semiconductor group. That said, he remains bullish on Nvidia.\"We haven't given up on NVDA given the technology moat and valuation at 18x the $10 EPS bogey,\" said Curtis.The five-star analyst contends that ASIC adoption is still in its early phases, giving Nvidia plenty of room to grow amid robust spending. He thinks that ongoing worries about NVDA are overstated, given that Blackwell Ultra rollout is on track and Rubin is set to ramp in the second half of 2026.Furthermore, Curtis noted Nvidia's dominance in the AI chip space and expects the company's Vera-Rubin and NVLink 6 launches in the second half of 2026 to bolster its position. He expects Blackwell-backed LLMs to be introduced in the first half of 2026 and act as a potential catalyst for NVDA stock.Curtis also expects Nvidia's launch of its new CPX chip in the second half of 2026 to benefit from higher capital spending by hyperscalers and rising focus on inference. The analyst currently expects CPX to generate revenue of $13 billion in calendar year 2027. Based on all these positives, Curtis raised his 2026 and 2027 earnings per share (EPS) estimates for Nvidia to $7.82 and $9.50 from $6.83 and $9.03, respectively.Curtis ranks No. 58 among more than 10,100 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been profitable 64% of the time, delivering an average return of 27.8%.",

    "body": "Alphabet-owned Waymo has resumed its driverless ride-hail service in the San Francisco Bay Area after a temporary pause during blackouts that plagued the city beginning on Saturday afternoon.\"Yesterday's power outage was a widespread event that caused gridlock across San Francisco, with non-functioning traffic signals and transit disruptions,\" a Waymo spokesperson, Suzanne Philion, told CNBC in an e-mailed statement Sunday afternoon. \"While the failure of the utility infrastructure was significant, we are committed to ensuring our technology adjusts to traffic flow during such events,\" she added.Waymo notice of service outage in San Francisco. Source: WaymoAs power outages spread yesterday, videos shared on social media appeared to show multiple Waymo vehicles stalled in traffic in different parts of the city.San Francisco resident Matt Schoolfield said he saw at least three Waymo autonomous vehicles stopped in traffic Saturday around 9:45 p.m. local time, including one he photographed on Turk Boulevard near Parker Avenue.\"They were just stopping in the middle of the street,\" Schoolfield said.A Waymo vehicle stuck between Parker and Beaumont, on the north side of Turk Boulevard in San Francisco.Credit: Matt SchoolfieldThe power outages began around 1:09 p.m. Saturday and peaked roughly two hours later, affecting about 130,000 customers, according to Pacific Gas and Electric. As of Sunday morning, about 21,000 customers remained without power, mainly in the Presidio, the Richmond District, Golden Gate Park and parts of downtown San Francisco.PG&E said the outage was caused by a fire at a substation that resulted in \"significant and extensive\" damage, and said it could not yet provide a precise timeline for full restoration.San Francisco Mayor Daniel Lurie said in a 9 p.m. update on X that police officers, fire crews, parking control officers and city ambassadors were deployed across affected neighborhoods.Waymo's Philion also told CNBC that \"While the Waymo Driver is designed to treat non-functional signals as four-way stops, the sheer scale of the outage led to instances where vehicles remained stationary longer than usual to confirm the state of the affected intersections. This contributed to traffic friction during the height of the congestion.\" Waymo \"closely coordinated with San Francisco city officials,\" she said, and proactively paused its service as of Saturday evening and in the first half of the day on Sunday. \"The majority of active trips were successfully completed before vehicles were safely returned to depots or pulled over,\" she noted.Amid the disruption, Tesla CEO Elon Musk posted on X: \"Tesla Robotaxis were unaffected by the SF power outage.\"Unlike Waymo, Tesla does not operate a driverless robotaxi service in San Francisco.Tesla's local ride-hailing service uses vehicles equipped with \"FSD (Supervised),\" a premium driver assistance system. The service requires a human driver behind the wheel at all times. According to state regulators — including the California Department of Motor Vehicles and California Public Utilities Commission — Tesla has not obtained permits to conduct driverless testing or services in the state without human safety supervisors behind the wheel, ready to steer or brake at any time.Tesla is vying to become a robotaxi titan, but does not yet operate commercial, driverless services. Tesla's Robotaxi app allows users to hail a ride; however, its vehicles currently have human safety supervisors or drivers on board, even in states where the company has obtained permits for driverless operations. Waymo, which leads the nascent industry in the West, is Tesla's chief competitor in AVs, along with Chinese players like Baidu-owned Apollo Go.The outage-related disruptions in San Francisco come as robotaxi services are becoming more common in other major U.S. cities. Waymo is among a small number of companies operating fully driverless ride-hailing services for the public, even as unease about autonomous vehicles remains high.A survey by the American Automobile Association earlier this year found that about two-thirds of U.S. drivers said they were fearful of autonomous vehicles.The Waymo pause in San Francisco indicates cities are not yet ready for highly automated vehicles to inundate their streets, said Bryan Reimer, a research scientist at the MIT Center for Transportation and co-author of \"How to Make AI Useful.\"\"Something in the design and development of this technology was missed that clearly illustrates it was not the robust solution many would like to believe it is,\" he said.Reimer noted that power outages are entirely predictable. \"Not for eternity, but in the foreseeable future, we will need to mix human and machine intelligence, and have human backup systems in place around highly automated systems, including robotaxis,\" he said.State and city regulators will need to consider what the maximum penetration of highly automated vehicles should be in their region, Reimer added, and AV developers should be held responsible for \"chaos gridlock,\" just as human drivers would be held responsible for how they drive during a blackout.— CNBC's Riya Bhattacharjee contributed reporting.",

    "body": "Photo from the Jeffrey Epstein files released by the U.S. Justice Department shows photos with prominent people including a Pope, Bill Clinton, and Donald Trump. Image was redacted by CNBC.U.S. Department of JusticeThe Department of Justice on Sunday restored online a photo from the Jeffrey Epstein files that contained images showing President Donald Trump after backlash over its removal.The image, which contained two separate photos showing Trump, had been removed by the DOJ from public view after being published on the department's website on Friday.  The image showed an array of items on and in Epstein's desk or credenza.One of the photos showed Trump with a group of women, while the other was a well-known image showing him with his wife, Melania, Epstein, and Epstein's now-convicted accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell.\"The Southern District of New York flagged an image of President Trump for potential further action to protect victims,\" the DOJ said in a post on the social media site X.\"Out of an abundance of caution, the Department of Justice temporarily removed the image for further review. After the review, it was determined there is no evidence that any Epstein victims are depicted in the photograph, and it has been reposted without any alteration or redaction.\"The DOJ did not say what it meant by the Southern District of New York. The SDNY can refer both to the federal judicial district that includes Manhattan, New York, and the U.S. Attorney's Office in that district, which prosecutes federal criminal cases.On Saturday, congressional Democrats questioned the removal of the photo.\"This photo, file 468, from the Epstein files that includes Donald Trump has apparently now been removed from the DOJ release,\" Democrats on the House Oversight Committee said in a post on X. \"@AGPamBondi is this true?

The photograph showed a collection of framed and unframed photos that included Trump and other high-profile figures such as former President Bill Clinton and Pope John Paul II.\"When we hear from victims' rights groups about this type of photograph, we pull it down and investigate,\" Blanche said.Earlier this month, SDNY Judge Richard Berman ordered the unsealing of grand jury materials related to the DOJ's prosecution of Epstein in 2019 on child sex trafficking charges.That order included a provision that the DOJ address survivors' concerns about the content of the files. The DOJ on Friday released just a fraction of documents and images from the Epstein case, even though the new Epstein Files Transparency Act mandated that all DOJ files related to him and Maxwell be released by that date.The DOJ's failure to release all material by that deadline drew sharp criticism from Democrats and Republicans alike. In addition, several Epstein victims criticized the DOJ for allegedly not keeping them informed about the contents of Friday's release — a move some survivors said could have put them in danger, according to several news reports.Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky. — who with Ro Khanna, D-Calif., co-sponsored the House bill that ordered the DOJ to release the Epstein files — has threatened to hold Justice Department officials accountable for how the files' release has been handled.In an interview Sunday on CBS' \"Face the Nation,\" Massie said some congressional lawmakers are considering holding Attorney General Pam Bondi in contempt.\"The quickest way, and I think most expeditious way, to get justice for these victims, is to bring inherent contempt against Pam Bondi,\" Massie said.",

Based on the story, it is likely the apartment has at least two bedrooms, according to Cody Garrett, a certified financial planner at Measure Twice Financial in Houston.Today, a two-bedroom apartment at that location would cost around $2 million, Garrett estimates, with a mortgage payment of around $10,000 per month before taxes, insurance and maintenance.Read more CNBC personal finance coverageTrump promises 'largest tax refund season of all time.'

The median asking rent for a two-bedroom, two-bathroom apartment in that same ZIP code is $9,175 per month as of November and $8,400 per month more broadly on the Upper West Side, according to StreetEasy, a New York City real estate search website owned by Zillow.Meanwhile, the median asking price for a two-bedroom, two-bathroom apartment is around $2.5 million as of November and almost $2.2 million on the Upper West Side, according to StreetEasy data. To rent or buy? New York City Madison Square park view with Christmas lights and Manhattan skyscrapers.Getty ImagesThe question \"Should I buy or should I rent?\" is increasingly relevant today.Renting is cheaper than paying a mortgage in all 50 of the largest U.S. metropolitan areas, according to an April Bankrate study. That cost difference has grown in 38 metro areas in the past year, Bankrate's research found. Yet, New York does not top the list for the biggest difference between renting and buying. Instead, cities including San Francisco; San Jose, California; Seattle; Denver; and Salt Lake City are in the top five. There are reasons why buying can be more financially challenging. Rising home prices have outpaced rent increases in many markets, while mortgage rates have also climbed. Housing supply can also be an issue, with not enough homes available for aspiring purchasers.Emotions may also factor into the buying vs. renting trade-off. For some, buying can offer a sense of security. Others may prefer the reduced responsibility for upkeep that renting provides.\"I actually consider a primary residence to be a lifestyle decision, not an investment,\" Garrett said.To help clients gauge housing affordability, Garrett said he refers to the 28/36 rule. That means no more than 28% of gross monthly income should go to housing costs, and total debt including housing should be no more than 36% of monthly gross income. Monthly homeownership costs are typically measured by PITI — the sum of mortgage principal, interest, taxes and insurance.The fictitious couple Walter and Emily Hobbs in the \"Elf\" movie would need gross income exceeding $450,000 to justify buying the property, according to Garrett. Walter is an executive at a children's book publisher, while Emily also has an unspecified high-level job. Even if they meet that income threshold for home ownership, they may still be squeezed by saving and planning for retirement, Garrett said. Moreover, their son Michael attends York Preparatory school, where annual tuition and fees currently run around nearly $68,000 for grades six through 12.Garrett recently worked with a client who purchased a home in the same neighborhood for around $15,000 per month. Ahead of the purchase, Garrett cautioned the client about how the high home costs could require sacrifice in other aspects of life, including pushing their targeted retirement date later.The \"Elf\" movie has other lessons when it comes to cost of living, particularly for the character Jovie, who works at Gimbels department store and lives in Chinatown.Because it appears she is living paycheck to paycheck, she likely isn't saving for retirement or emergencies, Garrett said, which is common among people who move to New York in search of success. As Leon the snowman tells Buddy when he leaves the North Pole for New York, \"This might be the golden opportunity to find out who you really are.\"Those who move to New York or other big metro areas with similar aspirations may take steps to try to defray the high cost of living, Garrett said. For example, to ease her financial situation, Jovie may find roommates or additional streams of income, he said. ",

    "body": "Still from Disney's \"Avatar: Fire and Ash.\"DisneyThe opening weekend for Disney's \"Avatar: Fire and Ash\" was less of a blaze and more of a simmer.And that's the expectation for the full theatrical run of the third installment in James Cameron's Avatar franchise. During its first three days in theaters, \"Fire and Ash\" tallied $88 million, falling well shy of analysts' expectations, which called for a debut haul between $110 million and $125 million. For comparison, 2022's \"Avatar: The Way of Water\" brought in $134 million during the same three-day period.Internationally, the film collected $257 million, bringing the film's global opening to an estimated $345 million.\"Fire and Ash\" faced some theatrical headwinds, namely its over-three-hour runtime. There was also less pent-up demand compared to \"The Way of Water,\" which was released more than a decade after the first Avatar film. Some box office analysts and critics noted that \"Fire and Ash\" has less technological innovation than its predecessors, which had been a driving factor in past ticket sales.Around 5.2 million domestic moviegoers went to see \"Fire and Ash,\" according to data from EntTelligence, a massive decline from the 8.7 million that ventured out in 2022 to see the opening weekend of \"The Way of Water.\"Still, the Avatar franchise has never been front-loaded at the box office. The first film, 2009's \"Avatar,\" generated just $77 million in its opening weekend domestically, but stayed in theaters for nearly a year. By the time it exited theaters, the film had generated $2.7 billion globally. With re-releases, the film now stands at $2.9 billion, according to data from Comscore.\"The Way of Water\" ran in theaters for 23 weeks and has grossed $2.3 billion globally.\"With less than two weeks remaining in the box office year, the pressure on 'Avatar: Fire And Ash' to deliver big was intense and though the film may have come in a bit below pre-release opening weekend projections, the Avatar films have always been known for their marathon box office trajectories,\" said Paul Dergarabedian, head of marketplace trends at Comscore.Also aiding the franchise at the box office are premium large-format ticket sales. The Avatar films have over-indexed with the more expensive experiential screens like IMAX and Dolby as well as 3D showings. Disney reported that 3D and premium theaters accounted for 66% of the weekend total.While 3D films have fallen out of favor with domestic audiences, they remain popular internationally —especially in China. Indeed, \"Avatar\" made the bulk of its money outside the U.S., with a whopping $2.08 billion coming from overseas.",

    "body": " An illustration photo shows Moore Threads logo in a smartphone in Suqian, Jiangsu Province, China on October 30, 2025. Cfoto | Future Publishing | Getty ImagesChina's hottest artificial-intelligence listings are delivering eye-popping gains.Shares of chipmaker MetaX Integrated Circuits skyrocketed almost 700% in their Shanghai market debut last week, while Moore Threads soared over 400% on its first day of trading earlier this month.While domestic investors scramble for exposure to promising Chinese tech listings, overseas investors are largely left out from partaking in such blockbuster offerings.Foreign retail investors in particular are shut out of mainland China IPOs: \"It's not even possible. Unless they open up an account with a Chinese broker,\" said Chris Zhang, executive director at Chinese financial services firm China Fortune Securities Company.Opening an onshore brokerage account with a Chinese securities firm requires a linked Chinese bank account, which generally requires a proof of residence in China, or a Chinese visa with sufficient validity. Foreigners also need to already hold other mainland-listed shares before being eligible to participate in an IPO lottery.Most foreign banks do not have the necessary arrangements with Chinese brokers to support account openings, Zhang said, making the process unworkable for the vast majority of overseas retail investors.Official guidance from Shanghai's city government states that only a narrow set of foreign individuals can directly open brokerage accounts for A-shares — stocks listed in mainland China. For example, foreigners with permanent resident status, workers in China, or foreigners working abroad with equity incentive plans in A-share listed companies. For many global investors, Stock Connect, a program that allows Hong Kong and mainland Chinese exchanges mutual access to each other's stocks, is the most convenient way to gain exposure to Chinese equities.It allows overseas investors to buy A-shares through their Hong Kong brokers without needing an onshore account, or special licenses— but the scheme offers little help when it comes to IPOs, or even freshly listed stocks. Access also depends on Hong Kong brokers' eligibility requirements, such as minimum account balances and risk disclosures.\"Stock Connect does not work because newly listed stocks are not included in Stock Connect as yet. Usually it takes a few weeks to months should the stocks qualify,\" said Theodore Shou, chief investment officer at Skybound Capital.Inclusion of companies in the Stock Connect scheme depends on whether a stock meets the eligibility rules such as sufficient trading activity and market value, which often requires a period of trading and data history for qualifying.Institutional exposure  Northbound trading, which refers to overseas and Hong Kong investors buying mainland China stocks via Stock Connect and other schemes, will not be available until \"typically several months after any listing,\" Shou said. Even then, it's not a guarantee that Moore Threads and MetaX will be included.Overseas retail investors can gain limited exposure through offshore funds that invest in A-shares. Foreign retail investors interested in STAR Market IPOs, such as Moore Threads and MetaX, can invest in non-China domiciled funds that invest in A-shares and usually these funds do participate in IPOs, Shou said. China's STAR Market is a Nasdaq-style tech board in Shanghai focused on strategic sectors such as semiconductors, AI and biotech, with looser profitability requirements and tighter access for foreign retail investors.\"However, such participation will be indirect, very limited, and mostly non-meaningful,\" he caveated, as IPO allocations may be tiny relative to the fund's total assets.While foreign retail investors are largely locked out of access to mainland Chinese IPOs, some large institutions can participate in them.A program for qualified foreign institutional Investors, or QFIIs, allows approved global institutions to invest directly in onshore Chinese stocks, including IPOs. But it is designed for large asset managers, sovereign funds and banks, not individual investors.QFIIs include the likes of investment banks such as Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs as well as central banks, among hundreds of other participants.The QFII and renminbi QFII schemes are programs that allow approved institutional investors to trade onshore A-shares and participate in IPOs, but they require approval from the China Securities Regulatory Commission, with foreign-exchange registration and settlement overseen by the State Administration of Foreign Exchange, or SAFE.While China's QFII and RQFII regimes do not set explicit asset-size or operating-history thresholds, applicants must be institutions with sound financial standing, relevant investment experience, robust governance and compliance systems, and a clean regulatory record.They must also appoint an onshore custodian and complete foreign-exchange registration with SAFE.The CSI 300 Information Technology Index, which measures the performance of information-technology companies within China's CSI 300, is up 32% year to date, compared with the benchmark CSI 300, up 17%, and Hong Kong's Hang Seng Tech Index, which has gained 24% so far this year.",

    "body": "Capsule hotels are a cheap alternative to expensive accomodation in London for office workers.Sawdah BhaimiyaWorkers who moved out of London for remote work are under pressure to come back to the office in the city, and some are choosing to stay in Japanese-inspired sleeping pods for just £30 ($40). I travelled to Piccadilly Circus in the heart of London to spend a night in a newly opened capsule hotel, after two of my colleagues who live outside the city recommended staying there. Zedwell Capsule Hotel, a brand owned by Criterion Capital, opened in September and offers nearly 1,000 capsules measuring 1 meter long, 1 meter wide, and 2 meters in depth — likely the smallest hotel rooms in London. It has a rather unassuming exterior despite being located inside the historic London Pavilion building — originally built as a music hall in 1885. The entrance is around the corner of the busy station, through some black doors.Private sleeping capsules alongside each other in Zedwell Capsule Hotel in London.Sawdah BhaimiyaThe cost of staying in a hotel in Central London is staggering, sitting at an average of £265 per night in the third quarter of 2025, according to real estate firm Knight Frank. In comparison, the average daily rate of hotels across Europe was 125 euros in the summer, according to an analysis of over 600,000 reservations from 2,000 independent hotels by RoomRaccoon. Criterion's Head of Hotels Halima Aziz told me that the capsule hotel addresses a gap in the market between budget hostels and affordable accommodation. \"We've formed this sweet spot between the two. We're not a budget hostel. We're not coming in at a £15 rate, giving you a bunk bed in a steel room,\" she said. \"When we decided to get into capsules, we really took inspiration from Asia, and the capsule concept was really born out of Japan as a response to very similar pressures we're facing in London.\" In Japan, the first capsule hotel was built in the city of Osaka in 1979, primarily to serve as an inexpensive overnight option for salarymen who worked late and preferred to stay out drinking and socializing rather than spending more money commuting home. It's given rise to some capsule-style hotels in New York, from sleeping pods by Kama Central Park, to Nap York, a sleeping station with private pods for short naps or overnight stays. Now that the concept has come to London, I was keen to see for myself what the British version has to offer.Inside a sleeping capsuleInside a sleeping capsule in Zedwell Capsule Hotel in London.Sawdah BhaimiyaIt's a Monday evening, and instead of my usual work-from-home routine, which involves preparing to go into the office the next day, I'm crawling into a brightly lit sleeping pod.I roll down the garage-like shutters and lock it from the inside as I prepare to sleep. My head is just inches beneath the ceiling of my pod, which has a light dimmer, two clothing hooks, an air purifier, a wide mirror stretching along the head of the capsule, and charger sockets. Although I can feel my luggage — a backpack and tote bag — at the end of my bed, and the bottom of my coat hung on the hooks, I'm surprised by how comfortable and cozy the bedding is. I switch off the lights and noisy air purifier and find myself enveloped by pitch black and silence. It feels eerie, but with nothing to distract me, I fall asleep quickly.Each capsule measures 1 meter long, 1 meter wide, and 2 meters in depth.Sawdah BhaimiyaEarlier in the day, I checked myself into the hotel using one of four kiosks, and as I roamed around the hotel, I noticed that the walls were painted black to match the exterior — and there isn't a single window in sight. I rode up to the first floor and used a key card to access my female-only dormitory. My capsule was one of seven stacked side by side or on top of each other, and some were only accessible via steps. A female-only dormitory inside Zedwell Capsule Hotel.Sawdah BhaimiyaI learned that despite the low initial cost, there was a series of additional amenities guests can pay for, from an extra £10 to be in a female-only dormitory, to £8 for a padlock, and £15 to store luggage securely. The hotel had an unfinished feel. The entrance was covered in scaffolding and the faint sound of drilling could be heard from inside the building. That's because it is \"still under construction,\" Zedwell's General Manager Greg Walsh told me. The drilling sounds were coming from underground where a larger reception was being built, with direct links to Piccadilly Circus Station. CEO Aziz confirmed that the building is not complete, adding that the additional cost for the female dorms was largely due to upgraded amenities, including a towel inside the pod and a female-only beauty room complete with hairdryers  — although this is still under construction and not currently accessible. \"Ultimately, if you're not just targeting the traditional hostel market, and you want to widen access, you need to respond to people's needs, and people have needs for laundry, for beauty, that wouldn't typically be considered,\" she added. While exploring the building, I found shared toilets and showers with classical music playing inside, as well as vending machines in the reception with snacks, drinks, slippers and eye masks amongst other items. I wandered out for dinner and with Oxford Circus, Leicester Square, and Covent Garden within walking distance, it wasn't hard to entertain myself. Zedwell Capsule Hotel is located in Piccadilly Circus, London.Sawdah BhaimiyaWorkers are coming back to the city During my time in the hotel, I discovered I was one of many working professionals in the building. I spotted several guests arriving in suits and ties and carrying briefcases. One chef from Newcastle even told me he paid a total of £284 to stay in the hotel for a fortnight to work in London. During the Covid-19 pandemic, many office workers in London moved out of the city, where it was cheaper to rent or own a home, due to remote and flexible working options becoming a normality. \"The cost of commuting from Oxford, Cambridge, city centers that aren't accessible via the London Underground system, is quite high.\"Halima AzizCriterion's Head of Hotels A 2021 report from City Hall said it was likely that London's population fell during the pandemic. The number of payrolled London employees dropped sharply by about 210,000 by November 2020, with the report citing that flexible work arrangements made it easier to move out of the city. The trend persisted, and by 2022, 43% of commuters lived over 30 minutes away from their workplace in the U.K., reflecting higher property prices in central areas, according to a report by commercial real estate firm CBRE which surveyed over 20,000 people globally.  Additionally, CBRE found that 41% of people worldwide were planning to move to more remote locations in the next two years either in the same city or to a different city. However, in 2025, there's been a sharp recall in remote work offerings with major companies enforcing return to office mandates in London from HSBC to JPMorgan, Amazon, Salesforce and John Lewis. A typically dormitory with roughly a dozen capsules inside Zedwell Capsule Hotel.Sawdah BhaimiyaZedwell's Aziz said one of the hotel's core demographics is young professionals and hybrid workers who are using Zedwell as a \"base in the city\" due to their flexible working patterns which require them to be in the office for a few days a week. Roughly 20% of the hotel's customers are corporate workers, Aziz said. \"The cost of commuting from Oxford, Cambridge, city centers that aren't accessible via the London Underground system, is quite high,\" she said. \"Our product is often cheaper than their commute or late-night travel home.\" The return-to-office mandate has left workers who don't live in cities scrambling to find inexpensive ways of staying in the city, without having to resort to unattractive options like hostels. \"Where they wouldn't traditionally consider a hostel product, we identified that they would indeed consider a capsule hotel, because it gave that privacy,\" Aziz added. As a Londoner, my usual commute to the office lasts just over 30 minutes, so the hotel doesn't offer much in terms of convenience for me, but I can see the appeal for those living further away from the city. When I awoke in the morning, I almost forgot that I wasn't in my bed at home. After a quick shower, I got ready inside my capsule before heading out and joining the throng of commuters in central London. ",

    "body": "Company: LKQ Corp. (LKQ)Business: LKQ engages in the distribution of replacement parts, components, and systems used in the repair and maintenance of vehicles and specialty vehicle aftermarket products and accessories. The company operates through four segments: wholesale-North America, Europe, specialty, and self service. It offers bumper covers, automotive body panels, and lights, as well as paint and paint-related consumables for refinishing vehicles; mechanical automotive parts and accessories; salvage products, including mechanical and collision parts comprising engines; transmissions; door assemblies; sheet metal products, such as trunk lids, fenders, and hoods; and lights and bumper assemblies. The company also provides scrap metal and other materials to metals recyclers; precious metals contained in certain of our recycled parts, such as catalytic converters; and brake pads, discs and sensors, clutches, steering and suspension products, filters, and oil and automotive fluids, as well as electrical products. It serves collision and mechanical repair shops, and new and used car dealerships, as well as retail customers. LKQ was incorporated in 1998 and is headquartered in Antioch, Tennessee.Stock Market Value: $7.66 billion ($30.15 per share)Activist: Ananym Capital ManagementOwnership: 0.39%Average Cost: n/aActivist Commentary: Ananym Capital Management is a New York-based activist investment firm which launched on Sept. 3, 2024, and is run by Charlie Penner (a former partner at JANA Partners and head of shareholder activism at Engine No. 1) and Alex Silver (a former partner and investment committee member at P2 Capital Partners). Ananym looks for high quality but undervalued companies, regardless of industry. They would prefer to work amicably with their portfolio companies but are willing to launch a proxy fight as a last resort. According to their most recent 13F filing, they manage $260 million across 10 positions.What's happeningOn Oct. 21, Ananym Capital called on LKQ to divest its European operations and refocus on its North American business.Behind the scenesLKQ is a leading distributor of aftermarket vehicle parts. Its core North America segment (40% of revenue and 55% of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) primarily supplies aftermarket collision parts, such as mirrors and bumpers. The Europe segment (47% of revenue/38% of EBITDA) primarily supplies mechanical and suspension products but contains a wide variety of other replacement and maintenance products. Although the European business is slightly larger by revenue, the North American business has significantly higher margins and a much larger market share compared with its peers. Lastly, the specialty segment (13% of revenue/7% of EBITDA) provides aftermarket parts for the RV market. Originally just a U.S. aftermarket parts business, the company began aggressively pursuing acquisitions in Europe starting in 2011, shifting from a focus on recycled parts consolidation to building and integrating a European footprint. Moreover, these two businesses are not nearly as similar as they sound, in North America they do primarily aftermarket collision parts like mirrors and bumpers and in Europe, it's primarily mechanical suspension and things under the hood.LKQ is no stranger to shareholder activism. In September 2019, when the stock was trading at $27 per share, ValueAct Capital engaged the company and settled for a board seat for one of its partners. Through this campaign, ValueAct was able to usher in a new wave of operational discipline, where instead of focusing on European M&A, LKQ paused large acquisitions and shifted its focus to growing the company's free cash flow and executing buybacks at an attractive discount. The results of this campaign speak for themselves, as LKQ's share price rose to over $60 during ValueAct's campaign, giving them an 86.39% return on their investment versus 16.15% for the Russell 2000. However, following ValueAct's exit, LKQ returned to its old ways, shifting their focus back to M&A, and the stock had subsequently declined more than 25% by February 2025, when two new activists entered the stock. In an uninspired campaign and settlement, those activists quickly settled for two board seats for independent directors and the stock has declined by 20% in the eight months since while the Russell 2000 has been up more than 7% during the same time.Now with the stock just slightly higher than it was in 2019 when ValueAct engaged, a third activist has entered to take over where ValueAct had left off, calling on LKQ to divest its European operations and refocus on its North American business. LKQ has always been a company that has benefited from simplification and harmed by complexity – and Ananym's plan seems to align with this approach: (i) halt major M&A, (i) divest the European business and other non-core assets, and (iii) use the proceeds to fund buybacks and reinvest in organic growth in the core NA segment. Operationally, there are several benefits to Ananym's plan. While the U.S. functions as a single market with consistent regulations, Europe is a series of nation states each with their own regulatory framework, making integration far more complex. This creates meaningful execution risks, exemplified by the company still needing to integrate more than 20 ERP systems in 18 different countries. Not only would divesting Europe leave the company with a higher margin business with a much larger relative market share, but it would also allow management to devote all their time and resources to North America. The alternative is to continue to focus a disproportionate amount of time on integrating all the European acquisitions across the different European countries all from their headquarters in Chicago and Nashville.The opportunity here is also clear from a valuation perspective. Industrial distribution peers typically trade at mid-teens or higher EBITDA multiples, while LKQ currently trades at 7.3x forward EBITDA. Not only is this a discount to the market, but to its historical levels, as even in its messy conglomerate form, LKQ has still traded on a 10-year historical average of 10x EBITDA. The European business could potentially be sold at an 8 to 9x multiple, but a sale even at the company's current multiple would be beneficial to unlocking value in the North American business, which could re-rate to its historical multiple of 10x EBITDA. The proceeds from such a sale could enable LKQ to repurchase up to 40% of its outstanding shares, which, when combined with the re-rating of NA, could easily translate to more than 60% upside from the company's current share price. While strategics with similar models, such as O'Reilly, AutoZone, and Genuine Parts, may find the European business appealing, strategics generally prefer clean businesses and this is far from that. Private equity, on the other hand, feasts on these types of projects, using their operational and restructuring expertise and flexibility of being out of the public eye to unlock these complex assets overtime in a way that is more difficult for public companies to address.In its short history, Ananym has established a reputation for striving to work amicably with management to create value for shareholders, and this situation appears to be no different. The fund has been largely complimentary of LKQ CEO Justin Jude who was named to the position in July 2024 and has his roots in the North American business. Under his short leadership, the company has already taken steps in the right direction — announcing plans to repurchase 14% of outstanding shares and divesting non-core assets such as its self-service salvage business that was sold in August to private equity. It has also signaled that its specialty business is on the market and it's expected to be sold in the near term. However, Jude seems to be a little more attached to the European business than these other businesses. Persuading him to divest Europe may take a little more time. If we learned anything from the previous activist campaigns at LKQ, this company needs a financially astute shareholder representative, not an independent industry executive. They do not need someone to help them with operations, they need someone to help them financially model, evaluate and potentially execute strategic options and work with the board to arrive at what is best for shareholders. Given Ananym's reputation as an amicable activist and their constructive relationship with Jude thus far, we think this is a perfect opportunity to put an Ananym representative on the board like Alex Silver who has extensive financial and private equity experience and brings a team of analysts ready to model available opportunities.Ken Squire is the founder and president of 13D Monitor, an institutional research service on shareholder activism, and the founder and portfolio manager of the 13D Activist Fund, a mutual fund that invests in a portfolio of activist investments.",

They predicted continued success, forecasting monthly revenue to multiply at least five-fold by late-2024.Then, they shuttered the whole thing to start over from scratch — all due to ChatGPT, says Amin.Today, Amin and Lowe, both 33, are the co-founders and co-CEOs of Anything, a vibe-coding startup valued at $100 million following an $11 million funding round in September, according to the company. The business was originally known as Create, a marketplace connecting startups to freelance engineers and artificial intelligence-powered coding tools to build websites and apps.Why blow it up?

Clients would bolt and the company would run out of money.After months of anxious deliberation, in October 2023, Amin and Lowe undertook the difficult process of laying off half of their seven-person staff and cutting ties with freelance developers, says Amin: \"Within two weeks, we were back to an empty office.\"They first launched an AI-powered tool to build app components like login forms and calendar tools. In April 2025, they released a new product for building entire online businesses, including backend authentication and payments systems, no coding experience necessary — and renamed the company Anything.\"That was actually the moment where it felt like it really took off,\" says Amin. Within two weeks of the company's relaunch announcement, Anything reached a $2 million annualized revenue run rate, he says.The AI coding industry is \"extremely early\" in its development, says Amin, as evidenced by overall mixed reviews for vibe-coding services. Still, non-technical users have built functional commercial apps with Anything, including a hair salon owner's AI stylist mobile app and a dental hygienist's app for tracking gum health, Amin wrote in a Sept. 29 blog post.Here, Amin discusses his realization that AI could upend their entire business model, the anxiety of determining whether to start over, and getting the timing right when launching a startup in an emerging industry.CNBC Make It: You decided to shut down and rebuild in October 2023. How painful of a decision was that, and what was the reaction from your company's investors?Amin: We went back to zero, so that was hard. We had to let go of half of the team. We had to shut down the developer marketplace and tell our customers we weren't going to do this with devs anymore.At the time, people were still kind of scoffing: \"Is this AI thing going to be real? Are you actually going to be able to build real apps [with just AI]?\"We had raised [$3 million] of venture capital. We had promised [investors] that we were going to hit [specific] timelines. Then, we went back to everyone and told them, \"Actually, no, we're going to go back to zero.\" Everyone was like, \"Are you sure?\"As you and your co-founder tracked AI's advancements, what were your conversations like?We talked all the time. We would revisit the position, like, once a month. It took me and Marcus a very, very long time to both come to the conclusion [to start the business over], and it felt like one of those decisions that both of us, as co-founders, needed to agree with.There'd be times where I was more bullish on the prospects of the [original] marketplace and what we could do with it. There were times where Marcus would be more bullish. And there were times where both of us were like, \"This technology is advancing so fast and we're using it in more and more places, does it just make sense to build a new product?\" That was hard.I think what ended up breaking that logjam for us was: We launched a few prototype builders, just to test and see if there was demand for [code-generation products] where you don't have to talk to any of us, you just can use it. That gave us some early signal. When we talked to our customers, it felt like the code-gen system had product-market fit.How confident were you that the underlying generative AI technology would keep advancing exponentially?Confident, but unconfident on the timescales. That was the scariest part. Through 2024, large language models kind of hit a plateau, to some extent, in capability. It was very unclear through that time how good [that technology] would end up getting. There were definitely [times] where it was like, \"Oh, boy. Did we make a mistake in trying to pivot?\"Could we even build something valuable and useful enough that people would want it and pay us for it? We had many opportunities to pivot to a quicker win, which would be: \"Let's make a prototyping tool. Let's make a design tool, because all [LLMs] can do is components. We'll sell it to agencies.\"What stopped you?Marcus and I always had this [mindset] that we'd already gone through one really big pivot trying to align closer to the mission of the company. That pivot would've been for naught if we didn't actually accomplish the mission of the company, which is that people should be able to build real production products, even if they don't know how to code.It's a useful founding story now: This company will stick through it, even if the technology shifts, even if the business model shifts. At the time, it was hard. Now, I can say with some pride: You don't have to just take my word that we're serious about what we're trying to do here. We've painted it in blood, sweat and tears.I expected it would take about a year to get this technology good enough to build real production systems. In reality, it has taken about two and I still think we're at the start. The sophistication of apps you can build with Anything — what it will look like in a year, or even two years, is just going to be dramatically different.I hope our hardcore pivots are behind us, at this point. Now, I think we're just more in the [mindset]: Let's execute, let's take advantage of opportunity, and let's really grow it.Where would your business be today if you hadn't shut down the marketplace to focus on AI?It's so hard to tell. I wonder if the company would still exist? Would the business we were building then still be attractive to [investors]? I think marketplace models like that, while popular in 2021, have really fallen out of fashion unless you're more pure AI [focused].This conversation has been condensed and edited for clarity.Want to be your own boss? Sign up for CNBC's new online course, How To Start A Business: For First-Time Founders.

    "body": "Sad female worker carrying her belongings while leaving the office after being firedIsbjorn | Istock | Getty ImagesLayoffs have been a defining feature of the job market in 2025, with several major companies announcing thousands of job cuts driven by artificial intelligence. In fact, AI was responsible for almost 55,000 layoffs in the U.S. this year, according to consulting firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas.There were in total 1.17 million job cuts through 2025, the highest level since the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020 when there were 2.2 million layoffs announced by the end of the year. In October, U.S. employers announced 153,000 job cuts, and there were over 71,000 job cuts in November, with AI being cited for over 6,000 for the month, per Challenger. At a time when inflation bites, tariffs are adding to expenses, and firms are looking to carry out cost-cutting measures, AI has presented an attractive, short-term solution to the problem. The Massachusetts Institute of Technology released a study in November showing that AI can already do the job of 11.7% of the U.S. labor market and save as much as $1.2 trillion in wages across finance, healthcare, and other professional services. Not everyone is convinced that AI is the real reason behind the dramatic job cuts, as Fabian Stephany, assistant professor of AI and work at the Oxford Internet Institute, previously told CNBC, that it might be an excuse. Stephany said many companies that performed well during the pandemic \"significantly overhired\" and the recent layoffs might just be a \"market clearance.\"\"It's to some extent firing people that for whom there had not been a sustainable long term perspective and instead of saying 'we miscalculated this two, three years ago, they can now come to the scapegoating, and that is saying 'it's because of AI though,'\" he added.Here are the top firms that cited AI as part of their layoff and restructuring strategy in 2025. Amazon Amazon CEO Andy Jassy speaks during a keynote address at AWS re:Invent 2024, a conference hosted by Amazon Web Services, at The Venetian Las Vegas on December 3, 2024 in Las Vegas, Nevada.Noah Berger | Getty ImagesIn October, Amazon announced the largest ever round of layoffs in its history, slashing 14,000 corporate roles, as it looks to invest in its \"biggest bets\" which includes AI. \"This generation of AI is the most transformative technology we've seen since the Internet, and it's enabling companies to innovate much faster than ever before... we're convinced that we need to be organized more leanly, with fewer layers and more ownership, to move as quickly as possible for our customers and business,\"  Beth Galetti, senior vice president of people experience and technology at Amazon, wrote in a blog post.Amazon CEO Andy Jassy warned of the cuts earlier this year, telling employees that AI will shrink the company's workforce and that the tech giant will need \"fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today, and more people doing other types of jobs.\" Microsoft Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella appears at the CES event in Las Vegas on Jan. 9, 2024. The event typically doubles as a preview of how tech giants and startups will market their wares in the coming year and if early announcements are any indication, AI-branded products will become the new \"smart\" gadgets of 2024.David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesMicrosoft has cut a total of around 15,000 jobs through 2025, and its most recent announcement in July saw 9,000 roles on the chopping block. CEO Satya Nadella wrote in a memo to employees that the company needed to \"reimagine\" its \"mission for a new era,\" and went on to tout the significance of AI to the company. \"What does empowerment look like in the era of AI? It's not just about building tools for specific roles or tasks. It's about building tools that empower everyone to create their own tools. That's the shift we are driving — from a software factory to an intelligence engine empowering every person and organization to build whatever they need to achieve,\" Nadella said.

Stefani Reynolds | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesIBMCEO of IBM Arvind Krishna looks on during a roundtable discussion hosted by U.S. President Donald Trump in the Roosevelt Room at the White House on Dec. 10, 2025 in Washington, DC.Alex Wong | Getty ImagesGlobal tech giant IBM's CEO Arvind Krishna told the Wall Street Journal in May that AI chatbots had taken over the jobs of a few hundred human resources workers. However, unlike other companies that had cited AI in job cuts, Krishna admitted that the firm had increased hiring in other areas that required more critical thinking, such as software engineering, sales, and marketing. In November, the company announced a 1% global cut, which could impact nearly 3,000 employees. Crowdstrike Founder and CEO of CrowdStrike George Kurtz speaks during the Live Keynote Pregame during the Nvidia GTC (GPU Technology Conference) in Washington, DC, on Oct. 28, 2025.Jim Watson | AFP | Getty ImagesCybersecurity software maker CrowdStrike said in May that it's laying off 5% of its workforce or 500 employees, and directly attributed the cuts to AI. \"AI has always been foundational to how we operate,\" co-founder and CEO George Kurtz wrote in a memo included in a securities filing. \"AI flattens our hiring curve, and helps us innovate from idea to product faster. It streamlines go-to-market, improves customer outcomes, and drives efficiencies across both the front and back office. AI is a force multiplier throughout the business.\"Workday Carl Eschenbach, CEO of Workday speaks on CNBC's Squawk Box outside the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland on Jan. 23, 2025.Gerry Miller | CNBC In February, HR platform Workday was one of the first companies this year to say its cutting 8.5% of its workforce, amounting to around 1,750 jobs, as the company invests more in AI. Workday CEO Carl Eschenbach said the layoffs were needed to prioritize AI investment and to free up resources. ",

    "body": "Vladimir Godnik | Fstop | Getty ImagesFor years, Braden Wallake has posted everything from business lessons to animal pictures on his LinkedIn page. A fateful midweek post on a late-summer day stopped the marketing executive in his tracks.Wallake shared a teary-eyed selfie with a message about his feelings after laying off staff. Just like that, he was the \"Crying CEO.\"\"I woke up the next day, texted my marketing person and said, 'I think I went viral last night,'\" said Wallake, whose post has raked in more than 57,000 reactions and 10,000 comments.Users blasted the HyperSocial CEO as being \"manipulative\" and displaying \"self indulgence.\" The photo \"would make a great dart board,\" another wrote.Corporate executives and founders like Wallake were sold on the idea that a vibrant social media presence can boost their personal and firm-wide brand awareness. But the reality is less picture-perfect than it's made out to be.In many cases, these leaders come off not as relatable but as cringey. And they're learning the hard way that their digital footprints can even have material business implications.\"There can be real benefits from CEOs being online, but there can also be great risks,\" said Ann Mooney Murphy, a Stevens Institute of Technology professor who has studied how company leaders gain social media celebrity status. \"One needs to tread carefully.\"The online executiveThe pitfalls of social media usage for business leaders are becoming increasingly clear as more executives take to the platforms. Nearly three-fourths of Fortune 500 chief executives had at least one social media account last year, up from roughly half in 2019, data from Influential Executive showed.More than seven out of 10 Fortune 100 CEOs with social platforms posted at least once a month in 2024, a 32% increase from the year prior, according to an analysis from communications firm H/Advisors Abernathy released this week. CEOs have flocked in particular to the work-focused social site LinkedIn, where they post three times a month on average. An active social media presence can help build brand recognition and drive attention from mainstream news outlets, Murphy said. It can also allow executives to develop para-social relationships directly with consumers — something that was once reserved for more-traditional celebrities like actors or athletes, she said.While company news was king in these posts, H/Advisors Abernathy found executives devoting more social real estate to sharing personal happenings. This softer style of content — examples of which include Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg sharing pictures from Taylor Swift's \"Eras\" tour and Goldman Sachs' David Solomon posting details for his DJ sets — can help keep followers engaged, Murphy said.Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon performs at Schimanski night club in Brooklyn, New York.Trevor Hunnicutt | ReutersA subsector has sprouted up around executives' social media habits, with several businesses offering training programs or consulting services focused on best practices. PayPal made waves in marketing circles earlier this year when it posted a \"Head of CEO Content\" role, which paid upwards of $300,000 in part to lead social media communications strategy.Promise and perilBut in recent years, a growing list of anecdotes like Wallake's \"Crying CEO\" experience show how posting through life can go awry.Jason Yanowitz boasted on X in October that Blockworks, the crypto company he co-founded, saw \"massive growth\" and hit \"record revenues\" in 2025. He also said the company was shuttering its news division and recommended staffers to anyone hiring journalists covering digital currencies.One user suggested that Yanowitz forgo smiley faces and strike a tone with less \"triumphancy\" in a post announcing job cuts. Someone else replied that \"before jumping into what's next,\" he should \"address the real people who were impacted.\"Yanowitz, who declined CNBC's interview request, later wrote on X that he \"should not have mentioned revenue\" in the original post.Around the same time as Yanowitz's tweet, a social media video featuring Snowflake revenue chief Mike Gannon offered a case study on how these incidents can evolve into real-world crises.In an Instagram clip viewed millions of times, Gannon told a street interviewer that the data storage firm was slated to rake in $10 billion \"in a couple of years.\" Shortly after, Snowflake said in a regulatory filing that statements made in the interview were not authorized and that investors \"should not rely upon\" them. The company declined to make Gannon available for an interview.Tesla CEO Elon Musk has shared visions for his business ventures on social media in between musings about politics and cultural issues. Two years ago, Musk found himself in court defending comments related to business plans made on X, his social media platform formerly known as Twitter.Alex Spiro, attorney to Elon Musk, center, departs court in San Francisco, California, US, on Tuesday, Jan. 17, 2023.Benjamin Fanjoy | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesIn several instances, readers have responded directly to executives whose content they find problematic or cringe-inducing. Some, like Ryan Benson, have also mocked the broader trend of business leaders' attempting to connect directly via social media.\"It's just disingenuous,\" said Benson, 28. \"They're not trying to speak with people the way that maybe an influencer has success in. They're trying to talk at people to make them think something about their position.\"Executives' missteps on social media can catalyze discontent from investors, consumers or employees, according to Murphy of the Stevens Institute of Technology. In some situations, she said social media statements could lead to increased regulatory or legal risk for the companies they represent.Is all attention good?Despite the downfalls, corporate leaders who have seen the underbelly of social media don't regret being online.HyperSocial's Wallake said he initially took time away from LinkedIn to let the dust settle and now thinks twice before making a post. But Wallake still recommends other business managers harness social media to grow their brands given the benefits. If someone does bring up his teary picture, Wallake brushes it off.\"If people want to call me the 'Crying CEO,' they're more than welcome to,\" Wallake said. \"If they actually get to meet me, they're going to see me smiling way more often than they're going to see me ever crying.\"When Yehong Zhu, co-founder of media technology startup Zette AI, jumped on a day-in-my-life trend, responders roasted her over perceived laziness. People said she should be \"embarrassed\" and was \"fundamentally useless to society.\" One commenter said they were \"printing this out and taping it to the wall to remind me every time I catch myself believing in meritocracy.\"Zhu received handwritten hate mail tied to the post sent to her office. But she also noticed a flood of press coverage that included the company's name and signups to a product waitlist, underscoring the power of publicity — even if it's negative.\"After there was this huge influx of attention, I realized, you know what, maybe all attention is good attention,\" Zhu said. \"As long as your name is in their mouth, you're doing something right.\"Zhu later understood that her post was taken as \"rage bait,\" a genre of content so infamous that Oxford named it the 2025 word of the year. She's currently undergoing a social media rebrand and is considering leaning toward controversial posts — with the hope of winning more attention online.\"I was not trying to rage bait,\" she said of the original post. \"The day that I actually try to rage bait, everybody will be actually enraged.\"Read more CNBC analysis on culture and the economyAn industry focused on death faces an existential crisisFrom fraternities to women's soccer, this under-the-radar T-shirt brand is popping up everywhereFor first-time job hunters, a college degree isn't unlocking the opportunities it once didYoung adults are betting on risky stock and crypto investments.

    "body": "Planet A Foods' ChoViva chocolate alternativePlanet A FoodsIf you're unwrapping chocolate this holiday season, it might not contain any actual cocoa.Market turbulence, ethical concerns and sustainability questions have sparked a movement among some chocolate makers to scrap cocoa in favor of alternative ingredients — prompting calls that the real deal could soon become a \"luxury\" for consumers.  Market upheaval Poor agricultural conditions in Ghana and Cote d'Ivoire — the world's leading cocoa producers — have damaged crop yields in recent years, sending cocoa prices on a rollercoaster ride. After surging to all-time highs of more than $12,000 toward the end of last year, cocoa futures have tumbled more than 50% over the course of 2025 amid tentative signs of crop recovery. Stock Chart IconStock chart iconCocoa futuresPrice volatility has left businesses in the industry on edge, and it's ultimately found its way into consumer goods, with data from Circana and the U.S. Bureau for Labor Statistics showing chocolate prices surged 30% in the year to October.In its third-quarter earnings report, Mondelez International — the maker of Cadbury, Milka and Toblerone — flagged \"volatility of cocoa\" and its \"ability to effectively hedge against\" related cost pressures as potential problems that could derail the company from meeting its financial targets. As manufacturers grapple with that unpredictability, some are opting to reduce their exposure to the cocoa market by shaking up their ingredient mix. Earlier this year, a change to the composition of McVitie's Club and Penguin candy bars made waves in the U.K., when it was reported that the products could no longer be referred to as chocolate. Both products must now be labeled \"chocolate flavored,\" after parent company Pladis cut the cocoa content in a bid to reduce costs. 'Real' chocolate becoming a luxuryPladis declined to comment on whether the changes had impacted sales when contacted by CNBC. However, according to Massimo Sabatini, co-founder and CEO of Italian startup Foreverland, a move away from cocoa is gaining traction among international confectioners, so much so that it could become the norm to see \"fake\" chocolate used in more budget-friendly products. Foreverland uses carob, pumpkin seeds, and chickpeas to produce a chocolate-like product that's sold to companies producing confectionery, baked goods, and ice creams.\"In the chocolate space there are many products, from [bars] to products in which cocoa is not really the protagonist but a participant,\" he told CNBC, referring to goods like cookies, chocolate flavored cereal and chocolate-coated snacks. \"I believe the alternative chocolate will substitute this big market, while [pure chocolate bars] will be more and more a luxury product.\"Sabatini pointed to the recent Dubai chocolate trend to illustrate his point, noting that some of these chocolate bars were selling for as much as 80 euros ($93.09) per kilogram. \"[The chocolate market] is already going in this direction,\" he argued. watch nowOn top of the pricing pressure, Foreverland and other alternative makers tout their products as solutions to longstanding concerns about sustainability and ethical procurement in the cocoa industry. \"If you compare this alternative to other alternatives on the market, like a plant-based burger, chocolate is used in so many different applications, while a burger is a burger,\" Sabatini said. \"Chocolate can be a snack, can be a bar, can be a biscuit, can be whatever. There are hundreds of different products in which chocolate is not a protagonist, in which alternative chocolate can really be a solution, to bring more sustainable products on the market, but at the same time depressurize the cocoa supply chain.\"Drew Geraghty, a New York-based commodity broker at ICAP, told CNBC that despite signs of price recovery on the futures market, pure chocolate could continue to command high prices for some time to come. Large cocoa users typically lock in prices far in advance, often covering eight to ten months of production, which gives them more control over price risk, but Geraghty said smaller manufacturers don't have that flexibility, so they usually only hedge three to six months out.Futures are contracts in which the buyer of the contract agrees to buy something — in this case, cocoa — for a set price on a set date. Cocoa futures for March delivery were last seen trading at $5,897 a ton in New York.  Geraghty noted that manufacturers who bought futures eight months ago were buying the higher prices seen throughout late 2024 and early 2025. \"If you look back when the prices really skyrocketed in 2023 and 2024 and early '25, the price on the shelf did not respond as quickly because the end users were still getting through their lower price futures cover — what they bought in the futures market six to eight months ago was going to dictate pricing,\" he explained. \"Cheaper prices today, with the market being down, say 50% from the beginning of the year, that will translate into cheaper prices six to eight months down the road on the retail side.\"watch nowJessica Karch, the marketing manager for German firm Planet A Foods — which makes a chocolate alternative derived from sunflower seeds — agreed that cocoa alternatives will become increasingly prevalent in the future. \"We do believe that the issues that we see currently in the supply chain of cocoa won't go away,\" she said. \"So, the prices might stabilize to a certain point, but it will not go back to how [cheap] it was in the past.\"Planet A Foods' ChoViva chocolate alternativePlanet A FoodsKarch said Planet A was already seeing growing demand, and noted that there was an increasing variety of alternatives coming onto the market. \"We do love chocolate, we do not want to replace chocolate, but we see a growing gap as well,\" she added. \"Because on the one hand, you have the issues in the supply chain, but on the other hand, you have the demand growing, especially in countries like China and India, and that's why we see a gap, and we want to help fill that gap.\"Market 'PTSD' driving alternatives marketBoth Karch and Sabatini told CNBC that demand was rising for their products. And they aren't alone in the market — a number of startups, including the U.K.'s Nukoko and America's Voyage Foods — offer what the former calls \"cocoa-free chocolate.\" Natasha Linhart, CEO of fast-moving consumer goods wholesaler Atlante, told CNBC that chocolate alternatives would likely become more prevalent in \"specific niches and hybrid applications.\"\"Cocoa-free or fermentation-based masses are increasingly being used in coatings, fillings and bakery to substitute part of the cocoa content,\" she said. \"Many manufacturers are already diluting cocoa by shifting their mix towards 'filled' products. Brands like Milka, for instance, have expanded ranges where a significant share of the bar is filled with yoghurt cream or rice crispies, lowering the cocoa intensity while keeping the perception of indulgence and value.\"watch nowLinhart said she expected to see more products where traditional cocoa is complemented with fillings to manage cost and supply risk. \"However, for mainstream chocolate tablets, cocoa will remain the backbone of the category, because of taste expectations and the emotional weight attached to 'real chocolate,'\" she said. ICAP's Geraghty said that due to \"PTSD in the market,\" cocoa alternatives were likely to be increasingly used wherever manufacturers can get away with it. \"At one point, cocoa butter was three times the price of cocoa futures, so cocoa futures were at $9,000, $10,000 a ton, and you were looking at cocoa butter at $27,000 to $30,000 a ton — massively expensive,\" he said. \"So [manufacturers] scramble — you make a smaller bar size, you find substitutes where you can. Even though prices have halved, [they'll be thinking] why should we spend that when we could substitute shea butter or some compound chocolate?\"",

The PBOC serves as the country's central bank, overseeing monetary policy, financial regulation, and currency issuance. (Photo by Cheng Xin/Getty Images)Cheng Xin | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesChina's central bank kept its loan prime rates steady on Monday, even as the world's second largest economy has seen weak economic data and an extended slump in its property sector. The People's Bank of China kept its 1-year and 5-year loan prime rates unchanged at 3% and 3.5% respectively, holding them for a seventh straight meeting, in line with a Reuters survey. The 1-year rate acts as a benchmark for new loans, while the 5-year helps peg mortgage rates.The PBOC's decision comes amid downbeat economic data from China in November, including lower-than-expected retail sales and industrial output. Retail sales rose 1.3% last month from a year earlier, sharply missing Reuters' median forecast for a 2.8% growth, and slowing from 2.9% rise in the prior month.Industrial production also missed expectations, climbing 4.8% in November from a year earlier compared with estimates for a 5% jump, and marking its weakest growth since August 2024.China continues to reel from a protracted slump in its real estate sector. Investment in fixed assets, which includes property, contracted 2.6% over the January through November period compared with a year earlier, sharper than the 2.3% drop estimated by economists.Prices of new homes also also continued to decline in November, showing persistent weakness in China's property sector. New home prices fell 1.2% in tier-1 cities including Beijing, Guangzhou and Shenzhen while resale home prices dropped 5.8% from a year earlier.When asked about the 7-month pause in monetary policy from the PBOC, Eswar Prasad, professor of trade policy and economics at Cornell University, told CNBC that \"some stimulus will help,\" but added that at a time when there's been weakness in the private sector, \"monetary policy probably won't get that much traction.\"\"With growth momentum weakening, they're going to have to turn on the stimulus taps, some monetary stimulus, perhaps, and ideally a little more fiscal stimulus, but that really needs to be packaged with some broader reforms,\" Prashad said.Earlier this month, China's finance ministry said it planned to issue ultra-long-term special government bonds next year to fund construction of key projects and new infrastructure projects.Policymakers also vowed to \"vigorously support the implementation of special actions to boost consumption,\" as country contends with deflationary pressures.An interim trade deal with the Washington that saw the suspension of prohibitive levels of tariffs on Chinese exports, however, could still help the country realize its \"around 5%\" economic growth target for 2025, as prospects of increased shipments to the U.S. rise. Mainland China's CSI 300 index was up 0.43% on Monday. The onshore yuan was flat at 7.04 against the dollar, while the offshore yuan weakened marginally to trade at 7.03 against the greenback.— CNBC's Anniek Bao and Dan Murphy contributed to this report.",

    "body": "It's important to build resilience, but how do we actually do it? I've spent 15 years researching happiness, and I've interviewed thousands of people about what makes it possible for them to thrive. I've learned that resilience isn't something you're born with. It's not even about bouncing back, a concept that often does more harm than good. Real resilience is about building specific habits that train your brain to weather difficulty without breaking. Here are 9 habits that actually work:1. Reframing stress as a signal, not a threatIf your heart is racing before your big meeting, your instinct might be to panic. Before you do, pause and tell yourself: \"I'm excited about this.\"I know it sounds like toxic positivity. It's not. Research shows that this simple reframing, shifting from a threat to a challenge, can change your physiological response. Your body doesn't easily distinguish between anxiety and excitement. The only difference is your interpretation. 2. Making one micro-decision daily with confidenceWhen you constantly second-guess yourself, your brain learns that you can't be trusted to handle outcomes. Confident micro-decisions can help rewire your brain and boost your trust in yourself.So pick your lunch without researching five options. Commit to a movie in two minutes flat. Send the email without editing it 10 times. This teaches your brain: \"I can decide and handle what comes next, even if it's not perfect.\" That's the exact skill you need in a crisis. 3. Building your support system with intentionIt's extremely difficult to maintain deep relationships with hundreds of people. Research has found we can manage about 150 stable relationships, but only about five truly intimate ones. The most emotionally resilient people don't spread their emotional energy thin or try to handle everything alone. They invest in these core relationships. And when things do get hard, they have people in their corner who can help them carry the weight. 4. Creating a 'done' list instead of a to-do listMost of us focus on what's left undone. It's a perpetual sense of failure. I want you to flip this.Every day, write down what you actually accomplished, even the small stuff. Over time, your brain stops noticing gaps and starts noticing progress. That shift is where resilience lives.5. Noticing and savoring one good moment every dayWhen you deliberately pay attention to positive moments, you rewire neural pathways for happiness. Pick one moment a day worth savoring. A good conversation. A small win. Really good coffee. Spend 30 seconds actually noticing it. This practice counteracts your brain's obsession with what's wrong and builds psychological resilience, one moment at a time.6. Practicing honesty in your closest relationshipsBe vulnerable with the people who matter to you. Tell someone about a real challenge. Ask for honest feedback, not just agreement. Have conversations where things might get uncomfortable.The most resilient people feel safe to be themselves without fear of judgement. Being open with people who you trust can help build that muscle. 7. Helping someone else, before you need helpThis sounds counterintuitive until you realize that helping others is a powerful recharge practice. Plus, you're building your support system for the future. You're reinforcing your identity as capable and resourceful.Most importantly, you remember that resilience is also about contributing and mattering to other people.8. Asking yourself, 'What's the worst that could happen?'Most people avoid this question because they are afraid of the answer. But research shows that actually imagining the worst-case scenario can reduce anxiety, not increase it.So after you ask yourself, \"What's the worst that could happen?\" actually sit with the question. Then ask yourself, \"Could I handle that?\" The answer is usually yes. Maybe not easily, but yes.The most resilient people understand that bad things can happen, but the most important thing is to be confident that you can handle them when they do.9. Practicing these habits in low-stakes momentsEmotional resilience is a skill you can hone. It doesn't require therapy, meditation retreats, or years of work. Start with just one or two of these habits. Reframe stress when the stakes are low. Build your support relationships now, not when you're desperate. Make confident decisions about small things, so you're ready for big things.Jessica Weiss is a keynote speaker and executive coach who teaches people and businesses how to find more happiness, fulfillment and satisfaction at work.

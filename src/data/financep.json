    "body": "President Donald Trump gestures as he speaks during a \"Great, Historic Investment in Rural Health Roundtable\" in the East Room of the White House on Jan. 16, 2026.Chip Somodevilla | Getty ImagesPresident Donald Trump said Friday he may impose tariffs on countries \"if they don't go along with Greenland.\" \"We need Greenland for national security. So I may do that,\" Trump said at the White House during a health-care-related event.The comments show Trump, whose push to acquire Greenland for the U.S. has grown increasingly aggressive in recent months, turning to one of his favorite tools for leveraging power over foreign nations.The White House did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for additional information on Trump's remarks.The Trump administration has previously said it is weighing multiple options, including utilizing the U.S. military, in order to take over the Danish territory. Trump asserts it is essential that America own Greenland — even though the U.S. already maintains a military base there — because of national security concerns posed by China and Russia.The White House has also said the U.S. is considering making an offer to buy the Arctic island. But Greenland and Denmark have repeatedly insisted that the territory is not for sale and has no wish to be absorbed into America.Trump's suggestion that he may wield tariffs to get his way on Greenland came after he described a similar strategy to force foreign countries to raise their drug prices.Trump has pushed to lower the cost of U.S. drugs by mandating that domestic prices match lower ones paid overseas.At the White House event Friday, Trump said he threatened the leaders of multiple countries to either raise drug prices as part of a \"most favored nations\" deal, or else face heavy tariffs on all their imports to the U.S.\"I may do that for Greenland too. I may put a tariff on countries if they don't go along with Greenland, because we need Greenland for national security,\" Trump said.A delegation from Greenland and Denmark, after meeting with Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio in Washington on Thursday, said they have a \"fundamental disagreement\" with Trump.Trump has greatly expanded the government's use of tariffs since retaking office, raising the overall average tariff rate to an estimated 17%.Many of his broadest levies were invoked using the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, or IEEPA. The administration's use of that law has been repeatedly challenged, and multiple courts have found the actions unlawful. The dispute has been elevated to the Supreme Court, which could soon deliver its ruling on the legality of Trump's IEEPA tariffs. Trump has claimed that his agenda would unravel if the high court rules against him.\"I hope we win the Supreme Court case, because if we don't, [it'd] be a shame for our country,\" he said Friday.",

Mitsubishi agreed to buy Aethon Energy Management LLC's US gas and pipeline assets for $5.2 billion, the biggest purchase by a Japanese company in the American shale sector. Photographer: Takaaki Iwabu/Bloomberg via Getty ImagesBloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesMitsubishi Corporation said on Friday that it will acquire shale gas assets in the U.S. in a $7.53 billion deal, including debt, as the Japanese trading house looks to build on its presence in the country's energy market.Mitsubishi is looking to capitalize on rising power needs from data centers, manufacturing, as well as LNG exports, by expanding in the the world's largest gas market, citing domestic consumption, production, exports, and further demand growth.It will acquire the assets from Aethon Energy Management in Texas and Louisiana in a transaction that includes $5.2 billion in equity purchases and $2.33 billion in Aethon's debt. Mitsubishi's deal comes after Japan's largest power generation company, JERA, announced a $1.5 billion investment in October in the Haynesville Shale basin on the Louisiana-Texas border, as part of Tokyo's $550 billion investment pledge to the U.S.Last month, Japanese media outlet Nikkei reported that projects in the energy sector were likely candidates for Japan's investment pledge, although it was not immediately clear if Mitsubishi's deal counts toward the proposed investment.In a filing with the Tokyo Stock Exchange, Mitsubishi said that the investment will strengthen the earnings base of the company's natural gas and LNG businesses. It will also accelerate efforts to build an integrated value chain in the United States, \"from upstream gas development to power generation, data center development, chemicals production, and related businesses,\" the company said. Stock Chart IconStock chart iconShares of Mitsubishi fell 2% after the transaction was announced.The company has multiple investments in natural gas, with projects in Alaska, Malaysia, Canada and Indonesia, among others. Mitsubishi has a total LNG production capacity across projects of about 15 million metric tons per year currently, and Atheon assets are estimated to add a similar capacity, doubling overall output. The company said it also plans to expand in the U.S. by engaging in power generation and manufacturing businesses that capitalize on competitive upstream gas projects.Mitsubishi currently has partnerships in upstream shale gas development with U.S. energy company Ovintiv in British Columbia, Canada, midstream marketing and logistics through subsidiary CIMA Energy in Houston, and LNG exports via LNG Canada and Cameron LNG.

Raymond Johansen, a Norwegian lawmaker for the center-left Labour Party and former governing mayor of Oslo, said in a Facebook post it was \"incredibly embarrassing and damaging to one of the world's most respected and important prizes,\" according to a Google translation.Machado, who met Trump at the White House for the first time on Thursday, said the gift to the U.S. president was a \"profound expression of gratitude for the invaluable support of President Trump and the United States to the Venezuelan people.\" It comes after a U.S. military operation seized Venezuela's president, Nicolás Maduro, on Jan. 3.The U.S. president thanked Machado on social media, describing it as a \"wonderful gesture of mutual respect.\" The White House later posted a photo of Trump and Machado, with the U.S. president holding up a large, gold-colored frame displaying the medal.A bust of Swedish chemist, engineer, inventor, businessman, and philanthropist Alfred Nobel (1833-1896) is pictured outside the Norwegian Nobel Institute in Oslo, Norway on January 8, 2026.Jonathan Nackstrand | Afp | Getty ImagesThe Nobel Peace Center, a museum in Norway's capital dedicated to the Nobel Peace Prize, said in a post on X: \"A medal can change owners, but the title of a Nobel Peace Prize laureate cannot.\"The Norwegian Nobel Committee and the Norwegian Nobel Institute had previously said: \"The facts are clear and well established. Once a Nobel Prize is announced, it cannot be revoked, shared, or transferred to others. The decision is final and stands for all time.\"\"Whoever has received the prize has received the prize,\" Trygve Slagsvold Vedum, leader of Norway's Centre Party, told NRK. \"The fact that Trump accepts the medal says something about him as a type: a classic scapegoat who will adorn himself with other people's awards and work,\" he added. The White House was not immediately available to comment when contacted by CNBC on Friday.'Politics over peace'Trump has frequently spoken about his desire to be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. The White House responded to the Nobel Committee's decision to award Machado the medal in October last year by saying they had \"proved they place politics over peace.\"Some Norwegian lawmakers appeared happy to brush off Machado's gesture, however, saying it should not be seen as an indication of who the award rightfully belongs to.Read moreDag-Inge Ulstein, leader of Norway's center-right Christian Democratic Party, told NRK that there is \"no doubt\" that the Nobel Peace Prize still belongs to Machado.Ine Eriksen Søreide, Norway's former defense minister and a member of the center-right Conservative Party, agreed with Ulstein.\"Even though Trump has now received the medal, it does not mean that he has received the Peace Prize,\" Søreide said.",

    "body": "watch nowThe Trump administration and several state governors on Friday urged the largest electricity grid in the U.S. to make the big technology companies pay for new power plants. Electricity prices have exploded in recent years on PJM Interconnection due in part to the data centers that tech companies are building to train and power artificial intelligence. The PJM grid serves more than 65 million people across 13 states and Washington, D.C. Its service area includes northern Virginia, the largest data center market in the world. The Trump administration and several states signed a pact that calls for tech companies to pay for new power plants built in PJM. Leading tech companies have agreed to fund $15 billion of new generation for the grid, according to an administration statement. The Trump administration and the states urged PJM to hold an emergency capacity auction to procure this power, according to the Department of Energy. PJM should also cap the amount that existing power plants can charge in the grid's capacity market to protect ratepayers, according to the administration. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum and Energy Secretary Chris Wright unveiled the plan at the White House with Maryland Gov. Wes Moore, Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro and outgoing Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin. PJM representatives were not at the event. \"We have to get out from underneath this bureaucratic system that we have in the regional grid operators and we've got to allow markets to work,\" Burgum said at the White House. \"One of the ways markets can work is to have the hyperscalers actually rapidly building power.\"Utility bills are rising in many parts of the U.S. despite Trump's promise to lower energy prices during his presidential campaign. The issue played a major role in the landslide victories of Democrats Mikie Sherrill and Abigail Spanberger in the governors' races of New Jersey and Virginia, respectively. The price to secure power capacity in PJM has exploded in recent years with $23 billion attributable to data centers, according to watchdog Monitoring Analytics. Those costs are passed down to consumers. This amounts to a \"massive wealth transfer,\" the watchdog told PJM in a November letter.PJM was six gigawatts short of its reliability requirement for 2027 in its most recent auction. Six gigawatts is equivalent to six large nuclear plants. Gov. Shapiro threatened to withdraw from PJM if it does not accept the proposed reforms. \"Make no mistake if PJM, this sort of faceless bureaucratic organization that is driving prices up on the American people, does not change and does not reflect what we are putting forth here today, Pennsylvania will be forced to act and forced to go it alone,\" Shapiro said.PJM said in a statement that it is reviewing the proposals laid out by the White House and the governors.",

Memory is used in AI systems to keep large amounts of data close to the graphics processing unit, or GPU, so it can run large AI models without slowing down.\"AI driven-demand is accelerating,\" Micron CEO Sanjay Mehrotra told CNBC's Jim Cramer. \"It is real. It is here, and we need more and more memory to address that demand.\"Mehrotra said that Micron is spending $200 billion to build more production capacity in the U.S., including two fabrication plants, or fabs, in Idaho and a 600,000-foot facility in Clay, New York, where the company broke ground on Friday. Mehrotra said it will take a few years to build out the facilities, including clean rooms and production equipment. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick attended the groundbreaking. Micron said it would invest $100 billion in that fab.He added that Micron is also working to produce more chips in its existing facilities in the near term.At the beginning of 2025, Micron expected 10% growth for server memory, but that growth ended up being \"high teens\" by the end of the year. Mehrotra also said the company saw stronger-than-expected growth in memory and storage for PCs. \"We see that tightness continuing into 2027, so we see durable industry fundamentals over the foreseeable future, driven by AI demand,\" Mehrotra said.The rush to supply the memory demand of companies like Nvidia, Advanced Micro Devices and Google has led to a shortage, and prices for the essential component are expected to rise an estimated 55% in the first quarter, CNBC previously reported.

He said the U.S. needs Greenland for national security and that only Washington can counter an alleged threat from Russia and China to the island.Peskov added that Trump \"has said that international law is not a priority for him.

The White House meeting, which was described as \"frank but constructive\" by Danish Foreign Minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen, ended on Wednesday without a diplomatic breakthrough, although they agreed to keep talking via a high-level working group. In a recent interview with the New York Times, Trump said he doesn't \"need international law\" and that only his \"own morality\" and mind can stop him.

    "body": "U.S. President Donald Trump, in front of U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr., delivers remarks at the White House, in Washington, D.C., U.S., Sept. 22, 2025. Kevin Lamarque | ReutersPresident Donald Trump on Thursday rolled out the broad outline of a health-care plan that the White House claims will lower drug prices and insurance premiums.The announcement came as a congressional effort to extend key Affordable Care Act tax credits faces headwinds from Senate Republicans, leaving millions at risk of seeing their health insurance premiums spike.The Trump administration dubbed the initiative \"The Great Healthcare Plan,\" the president said in a video unveiling the policy Thursday morning.\"I'm calling on Congress to pass this framework into law without delay,\" Trump said. \"Have to do it right now.\"The plan would codify the deals Trump recently struck with major drugmakers to slash the cost of certain prescription drugs in the U.S. by pegging them to lower prices abroad, as part of his \"most-favored-nation\" policy.More than a dozen pharmaceutical companies agreed to lower prices on certain products for Medicaid patients in exchange for a three-year exemption from tariffs. As part of those deals, companies also agreed to sell some medicines at a discount on Trump's direct-to-consumer platform, Trump Rx.Trump, in his video announcement, said those lower drug prices will take effect on the platform when it launches this month. He claimed that those prices would plunge by as much as 500%, even though that would mean prices would fall far below $0.The health-care framework would \"make more verified safe pharmaceutical drugs available for over-the-counter purchase,\" according to a White House fact sheet.It would also purportedly send money for health insurance coverage \"directly to the American people\" instead of giving \"big insurance companies billions in extra taxpayer-funded subsidy payments,\" the fact sheet says. Trump has repeatedly floated similar proposals in recent remarks.The plan would additionally \"fund a cost-sharing reduction program,\" which the administration says would \"reduce the most common Obamacare plan premiums by over 10%.\"Other components of the policy include requiring health insurers to prominently post coverage comparisons \"in plain English\" on their websites, along with other information about overhead costs and claim denial rates.It would also require providers who accept either Medicare or Medicaid \"to publicly and prominently post their pricing and fees to avoid surprise medical bills.\"The new proposal from the White House comes as senators remain at loggerheads on a deal to extend the now-lapsed ACA, or Obamacare, subsidies. A bipartisan group of senators has been working for weeks on a way forward, but hit a snag recently on language relating to the Hyde Amendment, a statute that bars the use of federal funds for abortion services. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt holds a press briefing at the White House in Washington, D.C., U.S., January 15, 2026.Evelyn Hockstein | ReutersThe White House plan notably leaves out an extension of the ACA subsidies, which Democrats are demanding be extended as a part of any health-care deal. The White House had not publicly put forward a proposal until Thursday, but Trump has repeatedly said he wants funds to go directly to patients rather than insurance companies.Some negotiators wondered whether the White House plan would hamper negotiations.\"We've all known that in order to be able to advance something, we're going to have to have buy-in from the White House,\" Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, one of the negotiators, told reporters Thursday. \"Does this set things back if he signals that he does not support extending [the subsidies]? I mean, that's the basis of our plan here.\"Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., who is leading talks on the Democratic side, said Thursday that she hadn't yet seen the Trump plan, but signaled optimism about the discussions.\"Most of the areas have agreement, so what we need to do is get bill text together and then get final sign-off so that we can talk to our colleagues about what we're proposing,\" Shaheen told reporters. A White House official on Thursday said the plan does not close the door on extending the subsidies, but lays out the president's preferences. \"This does not specifically address those bipartisan congressional negotiations that are going on,\" the White House official said. \"It does say that we have a preference that money goes to people, as opposed to insurance companies.\"Read more CNBC politics coverageRussia watches as ally Iran edges closer to collapse.

    "body": "A logo on the exterior of the ASML Holding NV headquarters in Veldhoven, Netherlands, on Wednesday, Jan. 24, 2024.Peter Boer | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesDutch semiconductor equipment company ASML has held gains to hit record highs, following Taiwanese chipmaker TSMC's strong earnings report on Thursday. ASML — Europe's most valuable company and the world's only supplier of the complex photolithography machines needed to manufacture the most advanced artificial intelligence chips — has seen shares rise around 7% since TSMC's earnings were released. The company became just the third European company to see its valuation tick above the half-trillion dollar mark on Thursday, seeing its market cap hit around 450 billion euros ($522 billion). ASML's stock has rallied 25% so far in 2026. Morgan Stanley on Thursday said in its bull case the Dutch company's stock could have a surge of 70% ahead as chipmaker spending continues to rise to meet AI demand. That scenario sees shares rise up to 2,000 euros if tech valuations continue to spike and profits beat expectations, the bank added, while its price target is 1,400 euros.\"Higher 2027 foundry and memory capex as well as better than feared China demand drives our conviction for higher FY27 earnings,\" the Morgan Stanley note said. \"We expect order intake over the next 2-3 quarters to confirm this strength.\"TSMC's capex guidance \"significantly\" exceeded prior expectations, Bank of America said in an analyst note on Friday, underpinning near-term upside for ASML \"as EUV [extreme ultraviolet] and advanced deposition tools become critical for efficiency gains.\"watch nowCompanies embedded in the global AI race have seen strong performances as demand for the technology has soared. The start of 2026 has seen a stock rally among companies providing memory chips, which are crucial components to advanced semiconductors designed by Nvidia and AMD. Memory prices are expected to rise another 40-50% in Q1 of 2026, according to Counterpoint Research. \"ASML stock has been on a tear due to the potential for strong capex at semi manufacturers starting late '26,\" JPMorgan said in a note on Wednesday. \"Samsung, the only DRAM major with available clean room capacity, is likely to increase orders most significantly in the quarter, while TSMC orders are also likely to be strong.\"DRAM, referring to Dynamic Random Access Memory, is a type of memory chip needed to store data required for AI processing. Earlier this month, major Nvidia partner Foxconn — the world's largest contract electronics manufacturer and maker of servers that hold chips in data centers — reported a 22% surge in revenues in the final quarter of 2025.TSMC, which is ASML's largest customer, got another boost on Thursday as the U.S. announced it would limit tariffs on Taiwan to 15%, with chip and technology companies from the country investing at least $250 billion in production capacity in the U.S.ASML is due to report its fourth-quarter earnings on Jan. 28.

    "body": "Google CEO Sundar Pichai during the press conference after his meeting with Polish PM Donald Tusk at Google for Startups Campus In Warsaw in Warsaw, Poland, on Feb. 13, 2025.Jakub Porzycki | Nurphoto | Getty ImagesGoogle on Friday filed to appeal a federal judge's ruling that the company held an illegal monopoly in its core market of internet search.The appeal could result in a delay of remedies against the Alphabet-owned company while the legal process continues plays out. The 2024 ruling \"ignored the reality that people use Google because they want to, not because they're forced to,\" Google Vice President of Regulatory Affairs Lee-Anne Mulholland wrote in a Friday blog. \"The decision failed to account for the rapid pace of innovation and intense competition we face from established players and well-funded start-ups,\" she wrote. The antitrust trial started in September 2023, and in August 2024, U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta ruled that Google violated Section 2 of the Sherman Act and held a monopoly in search and related advertising. At the time, Google said it would likely appeal the decision.Last Spring, the company and the DOJ participated in a remedies trial to determine the the consequences Google would implement. The trial included witnesses from Apple and Mozilla, as well as competitors from OpenAI and other companies. In September 2025, Mehta ruled against the most severe consequences proposed by the Department of Justice, including a forced sale of Google's Chrome browser. The ruling was seen as a win for Google, with its stock jumping 8% following the news. Mehta finalized the remedies in December. Mehta stipulated that Google must share some of its raw search interaction data that it uses to train its ranking and AI systems, but he spared the company from having to share its actual algorithms. Mehta also wrote that Google cannot enter into any deals like the search agreement the company had with Apple \"unless the agreement terminates no more than one year after the date it is entered.\" Analysts at the time compared the lighter-than-expected remedies to a slap on the wrist. Google is asking to pause the implementation of the remedies, Mulholland wrote on Friday. \"These mandates would risk Americans' privacy and discourage competitors from building their own products,\" Mulholland wrote. \"Ultimately stifling the innovation that keeps the U.S. at the forefront of global technology.\"WATCH: CNBC's full interview with Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabiswatch now",

    "body": "Da-kuk | E+ | Getty ImagesAs many Americans struggle to keep up with the rising cost of living — housing, groceries, electricity and other necessities — their financial stress is getting more attention in the workplace.In 2025, employer discomfort at their workers' financial well-being reached a new high: 48% rated their concern at 9 or 10 on a scale of 1 to 10, compared with 43% in 2024 and only 39% in 2023, according to recent research from the Employee Benefit Research Institute. As recently as 2019, the year before Covid, that share stood at 22%. Since 2022, \"we've seen employers shift away from retirement as the top area of concern toward more of the day-to-day cost of living issues, and budgeting and savings issues,\" said Jake Spiegel, a senior research associate at the Employee Benefit Research Institute. \"Employees are feeling the squeeze from above-trend inflation,\" Spiegel said.Paycheck to paycheckAlthough inflation has eased to a yearly rate of 2.7% since peaking at 9.1% in June 2022, prices overall have climbed more than 25% since 2020, based on the consumer price index.The result has been a large share of households whose budgets are pinched by higher costs. More than half (57%) of employees live paycheck to paycheck, according to a 2025 survey of close to 90,000 participants in 401(k) retirement plans by Bank of America. While wage growth has generally outpaced inflation over the past two years, that came after a period when income lagged behind inflation in 2021 and 2022.Employers, who are interested in helping employees manage stress in order to reduce absenteeism or worker dissatisfaction, have been doing more to focus on the financial well-being of their employees.Read more CNBC personal finance coverageMore employers worry about workers' financial wellbeing, research showsRepublicans want to end the 'marriage penalty' for this childcare tax creditEducation Department to delay collections on defaulted student loansTrump pitches direct payments for health care.

The study included responses from 406 benefits decisionmakers at companies with at least 500 employees and that are either offering financial wellness programs or interested in doing so.At the same time, a smaller share of employers say their efforts are making a \"large impact\": 43%, compared with 60% in 2024 and 73% in 2023. Employers may be taking cues from their employees when assessing the impact of their programs, he said.\"We see evidence in one of our other surveys … that employees tend to be less rosy than employers when it comes to rating the effectiveness of benefits,\" he said.Financial wellness designThe specifics of any financial wellness program differ from company to company. They could include, for example, benefits like payroll advance loans, short-term loans through a third-party and access to emergency funds through dedicated savings accounts or their 401(k) — either through a loan or hardship withdrawal.Other times, it could include offering seminars or webinars that focus on specific issues like creating a budget, investing or saving for retirement.Also, 68% indicated that their workers have access to financial advisors and 46% offer access to financial coaches. Sometimes, the company subsidizes the cost either fully or partly for workers to meet with experts one-on-one.\"Financial wellness [programs] with one-on-one sessions are a strategic way to provide more access\" to professionals who specialize in providing financial guidance, said certified financial planner Uchechi Kalu, founder of Greenlight Financial Planning in Los Angeles.Kalu is working with a nonprofit in Chicago whose employees are able to meet with her twice annually, via video calls, about whatever financial issues they are facing. With the employer subsidizing half of the cost, workers pay $118 per session, Kalu said. She said that when employers help pay for these kinds of sessions, it can make a difference in whether workers make use of the benefit or not.She has provided guidance related to a variety of financial issues, including budgeting, investing, home buying and affording overseas travel.  \"The one-on-ones are when you get to reach people in critical moments and help them along their journey,\" Kalu said.",

Before that announcement, collections had been paused since 2020 in response to the Covid-19 pandemic. Student loan borrowers who fail to make on-time monthly payments for more than 270 days are typically considered in default on their loans. At that point, the federal government has the right to seize up to 15% of borrowers' after-tax wages — as well as a portion of their Social Security income and entire tax refunds, where applicable — to repay the debt. Roughly 5 million borrowers were in default, and that number was expected to grow to nearly 10 million in the coming months, the Department of Education said in April. Around 9 million people are currently in default on their education debt, according to a recent estimate by Protect Borrowers, an advocacy organization.After the initial announcement about collection efforts, the agency has changed course on the policy several times. In June, it paused the plan to garnish Social Security payments.Then in December, the department confirmed around 1,000 borrowers would receive notification of intent to garnish wages during the week of Jan. 7, with more notices to follow. On Jan. 7, Protect Borrowers sent a letter to McMahon cosigned by the NAACP, American Federation of Teachers and several other organizations, urging the department to \"immediately halt its plan to resume garnishment of millions of struggling borrowers' wages.\"\"After months of pressure and countless horror stories from borrowers, the Trump Administration says it has abandoned plans to snatch working people's hard-earned money directly from their paychecks simply for falling behind on their student loans,\" Aissa Canchola Bañez, policy director at Protect Borrowers, said in a statement.— CNBC reporter Annie Nova contributed to this report.",

    "body": "Amazon package and Saks Fifth Avenue bag.Getty ImagesAmazon wants a federal judge to reject Saks Global's bankruptcy financing plan, writing in court papers the beleaguered department store \"burned through hundreds of millions of dollars in less than a year\" and failed to hold up their agreement. When Saks acquired Neiman Marcus for $2.7 billion in December 2024, Amazon invested $475 million into the venture on the grounds the retailer would start selling its products on Amazon's website and the tech company would offer technology and logistics expertise.\"That equity investment is now presumptively worthless,\" Amazon's attorneys wrote in a Wednesday filing, hours after Saks filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. \"Saks continuously failed to meet its budgets, burned through hundreds of millions of dollars in less than a year, and ran up additional hundreds of millions of dollars in unpaid invoices owed to its retail partners.\"As part of the deal, Saks launched a branded \"Saks at Amazon\" storefront on the e-commerce company's website featuring a range of luxury fashion and beauty items. It also agreed to pay a referral fee for Saks-branded goods sold on the platform, guaranteeing at least $900 million in payments to Amazon over eight years. In its filing, Amazon argued that Saks' bankruptcy financing plan harms the company, and other creditors, because it saddles parts of the Saks corporation with new debt that it previously didn't have. It also pushes Amazon further down the pecking order in terms of repayment, which reduces the amount it could potentially be repaid during the proceedings, the e-commerce company said in the filings. Amazon wrote that it \"hopes\" Saks will resolve its concerns, but if it doesn't, it may \"seek more drastic remedies\" including the appointment of an examiner or a trustee. During a hearing Wednesday in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Houston, Judge Alfredo Perez allowed Saks to start tapping into $1.75 billion in new bankruptcy financing after the company argued it would face immediate liquidation without it. He has yet to issue a ruling on Amazon's request. Saks' acquisition of Neiman Marcus brought a slew of new investors, including names from the technology industry. For Amazon, the deal guaranteed Saks' presence on its sprawling webstore, where the company has sought to attract bigger brands and grow its luxury selection, in particular. The Saks deal also raised the possibility that Amazon could deepen its investment in the department store chain. Amazon has been determined to have a bigger presence in physical retail and it's experimented with several concepts over the years, scrapping some along the way.The company has also struck similar investment agreements in the past. In 2022, Amazon took a 2% stake in Grubhub in exchange for the food delivery company adding perks for Prime members. Amazon expanded its stake in the company to up to 18% in 2024.Amazon and Saks both declined to comment beyond what they stated in filings.Software giant Salesforce also became a minority shareholder in Saks during its acquisition of Neiman Marcus, but it took a smaller stake than Amazon did. It's unclear if it also plans to object to the bankruptcy plan. Correction: An earlier headline on this article incorrectly quoted the Amazon filing. watch now",

    "body": "A sign is displayed at the Department of Labor Frances Perkins Building on June, 2025, in Washington.Kevin Carter | Getty ImagesA controversial social media post from the Department of Labor has poured gasoline on already smoldering accusations that the Trump administration is amplifying rhetoric and imagery linked to extreme right-wing ideologies.The video in the post, shared Saturday, features a quick-cut slideshow of artworks depicting glorified scenes of American history, foregrounded by a statue of George Washington.The caption above that video reads, \"One Homeland. One People. One Heritage. Remember who you are, American.\"Social media users quickly noted similarities — in word, form and sentiment — between the Labor Department's post and a slogan used by the Nazi Party.\"US Government posting a version of 'Ein volk, ein reich, ein führer,'\" said Terry Virts, a former NASA astronaut and current Democratic congressional candidate, in an X post. \"I don't see how this ends well.\"The slogan \"Ein Volk, ein Reich, ein Führer\" translates to \"One People, One Country, One Leader.\" It was \"one of the central slogans used by Hitler and the Nazi Party,\" according to the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum.The two messages are not a word-for-word match, to be sure. But while experts caution against jumping to conclusions, many see numerous other examples of the Trump administration — including the Labor Department — echoing white supremacist language, ideas or aesthetics online.Bill Braniff, executive director of American University's Polarization & Extremism Research & Innovation Lab, said he believes that, \"When you look at this one post in the context of all the others, it's not an accident.\"Even at face value, the post raises red flags, Braniff said in an interview. The assertion of Americans having \"one heritage,\" for instance, clashes with the nation's history of taking in people from all over the world and establishes the idea of an \"in group\" and an \"out group,\" he said.Jon Lewis, a research fellow at the Program on Extremism at George Washington University, agreed.\"You don't want to try and ever read into the tea leaves on something that might not be there,\" he told CNBC. But \"at a certain point, you have to ask how many times until it's not a coincidence anymore.\"\"At a certain point, you can't even really call it a dog whistle, it's just a whistle,\" Lewis added in an email. \"How many times will official [U.S. government] accounts post openly white supremacist content without any repercussions?\"The Labor Department, led by Secretary Lori Chavez-DeRemer, did not respond to CNBC's request for comment. A spokesperson for the department previously said, \"The social media campaign was created to celebrate American workers and the American Dream.\"That comment was given in response to The Guardian's report on union leaders denouncing the Labor Department over the post.\"It is no surprise that a fascist regime would post fascist propaganda on a fascist social media network like X, but it remains concerning to see the DOL making posts that serve a fascist, white supremacist agenda,\" Puneet Maharaj, executive director of National Nurses United, the country's largest nurses' union, told the outlet. A trail of accusations President Donald Trump arrives for a ceremony in the East Room of the White House on Jan. 15, 2026.Anna Moneymaker | Getty ImagesLabor's post is hardly the first time the Trump administration has been accused of spreading far-right or white nationalist propaganda through social media. But in recent weeks, the government has appeared to double down on some of the same controversial messaging.On Wednesday, ahead of diplomatic talks on President Donald Trump's increasingly aggressive efforts to acquire Greenland, the White House shared a possibly AI-generated cartoon showing two dog sleds at a crossroads, with one path leading to the U.S. and the other leading to Russia and China.\"Which way, Greenland man?\" read the text above that image, which was posted on the White House's official X account.Critics have accused the account of echoing \"Which Way Western Man?,\" the title of a 1978 book defending Hitler and advocating for a white nationalist and antisemitic worldview. The book was written by William Gayley Simpson, said to be a member of neo-Nazi group the National Alliance.The phrase in recent years has gained popularity on the far right. It has been used in memes in which an image purporting to represent modern society is contrasted unfavorably with an image representing tradition.The White House's post wasn't the first time a version of the phrase had appeared on government social media accounts. Five months earlier, the Department of Homeland Security had posted an ICE recruitment image captioned, \"Which way, American man?\" Assistant DHS Secretary Tricia McLaughlin at the time called reporters' questions about that post \"embarrassing.\"In response to questions about the posts from the White House and Labor Department accounts, White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson told CNBC, \"It seems that the mainstream media has become a meme of their own: the deranged leftist who claims everything they dislike must be Nazi propaganda. This line of attack is boring and tired. Get a grip.\"On Jan. 8, the Labor Department posted a photo of a saluting Trump under the words \"trust the plan\" — a recurring phrase among followers of the far-right conspiracy known as QAnon.Last Friday, DHS' official accounts posted an ICE recruitment image declaring, \"We'll have our home again.\"That phrase echoes the title of the song \"By God We'll Have Our Home Again,\" the lyrics of which have been \"credited to a U.S. fraternal neo-Nazi group,\" according to the Toronto Holocaust Museum's Hatepedia.McLaughlin, asked on CNN about DHS' use of the phrase, accused critics of \"manufacturing fake outrage.\"\"There are plenty of poems, there are plenty of songs, there are plenty of books with the same title. And the fact that people would like to cherry-pick something of white nationalism ... it's no wonder we're seeing such vast, rampant assaults against our law enforcement,\" she said.The DHS post, which also featured a stealth bomber and a cowboy riding horseback at the foot of a snowy mountain, came two days after ICE agent Jonathan Ross shot and killed Renee Nicole Good during an altercation in Minneapolis.The Southern Poverty Law Center said that the administration's turn toward allegedly white nationalist content on government social media channels may have begun last June, when DHS shared a cartoon of Uncle Sam calling on Americans to \"report all foreign invaders\" to ICE. Read more CNBC politics coverageRussia watches as ally Iran edges closer to collapse.

Thom Tillis vows to block Trump's Fed nominees following Powell probeSome of the most scrutinized posts have generated the heaviest engagement online. The Labor Department post from last weekend, for example, has tallied nearly 23 million views on X alone, possibly making it the account's most-seen post.But they fit into a broader messaging strategy that frequently promotes images and slogans evoking classic wartime propaganda posters and idealized depictions of Americana and U.S. history.The Labor Department has recently taken to sharing historical paintings captioned with, at times, overtly Christian messages. It also recently launched a social media campaign featuring AI-seeming illustrations of almost exclusively white men.In November, the family of famed 20th century painter Norman Rockwell accused DHS of misusing their ancestor's work \"for the cause of persecution toward immigrant communities and people of color.\"Some extremism experts say the messaging has become overt.One way to know that, said Braniff, is that \"the neo-Nazis themselves have noticed\" and are talking about the administration's rhetoric.Other extremism experts and scholars of fascism have also noticed, as have the union leaders who have called out the Labor Department, he added. \"It has to do with both the frequency of content coming out, but also the backdrop,\" Braniff said. \"It seems quite overt at this point.\"",

    "body": "A U.S. move to seize Greenland could damage trade ties with the European Union, France's finance minister has warned, as one analyst told CNBC that tariffs or economic sanctions could lead to a \"trade war.\"U.S. President Donald Trump has ramped up talk of annexing Greenland this month — and has not ruled out taking it by force. Talks between the U.S., Denmark and Greenland on Wednesday over the future of the world's largest island ended without a diplomatic breakthrough.French Finance Minister Roland Lescure told the Financial Times on Friday that economic ties between the U.S. and Europe could be damaged if Trump were to move to take the self-governing Danish territory. \"Greenland is a sovereign part of a sovereign country that is part of the EU. That shouldn't be messed around [with],\" he said.watch nowWhen asked whether the EU would hit the U.S. with economic sanctions if it invaded Greenland, Lescure told FT: \"I'm not going there. I mean, obviously, if that happened, we would be in a totally new world for sure, and we would have to adapt accordingly.\"His comments come as a Democratic-led U.S. delegation is expected to visit Copenhagen for talks with Danish MPs on Friday.Trump has said the U.S. needs Greenland for national security reasons. Analysts told CNBC that he wants to keep rivals out of emerging trade routes and, potentially, mining of minerals that are critical in industries like defense. \"Significant\" economic pressure in the form of tariffs or sanctions on Denmark by the U.S. \"could likely mean a significant E.U. pushback, where the E.U. could respond in kind, leading to a sort of trade war with the U.S. as well as constant headline risks,\" Dan Alamariu, chief geopolitical strategist at Alpine Macro, told CNBC over email.\"This would rattle markets,\" he said. \"It would also call into question NATO, though we don't predict this happening, or NATO breaking apart. Domestic political and markets pushback would likely moderate any such pushes by the Trump administration.\"Read moreMeanwhile, European troops arrived in Greenland late Thursday for a collaborative military exercise. This shows the U.S. that \"this is primarily an allied effort,\" Maria Martisiute, policy analyst at the European Policy Centre, told CNBC's \"Squawk Box Europe\" on Friday. \"If we want to reinforce veterans and defense in Greenland or the wider Arctic, it's not up to the U.S. It can be done via allied efforts.\"The exercise, combined with European leaders outlining their non-negotiable red lines, can \"send a powerful message,\" she said, adding: \"It remains to be seen how the U.S. will proceed in that regard.\"The European Commission, the EU's executive arm, proposed to double its spending on Greenland in its latest draft budget.\"What is clear is that Greenland can count on us — politically, economically, and financially and when it comes to its security,\" European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said on Thursday.

    "body": "Halfpoint Images | Moment | Getty ImagesAs President Donald Trump embraces more policy focused on affordability, some lawmakers have pushed to expand tax credits for families.  The Republican Study Committee this week released a framework for a second budget bill, known as \"Reconciliation 2.0,\" which outlines priorities like homeownership, health care, energy prices and financial support for families. Another reconciliation bill has support from House Speaker Mike Johnson and House Budget Committee Chairman Jodey Arrington, R-Texas., among others.  One proposal from the framework would expand access to the child and dependent care tax credit, or CDCTC, which partially offsets up to $6,000 of care expenses for two or more \"qualifying individuals\" — typically children under age 13 — when parents who file taxes jointly both work.      The CDCTC is often confused with the child tax credit, or CTC, of up to $2,200 per child under age 17 for the 2025 tax year. One key difference is the CTC doesn't require both parents who file taxes jointly to earn income.

Both parties are pushing messaging about affordability as many Americans struggle with the cost of housing, food, electricity and health care.    Here are some key things to know about the child and dependent care tax credit, and how it could change under the Republican Study Committee's framework.Who benefits from the CDCTC Only a small percentage of families claim the child and dependent care tax credit each year.   Roughly 6.5 million returns filed the form to claim the child and dependent care tax credit for tax year 2022, according to the latest IRS estimates. By comparison, nearly 37 million returns claimed the child tax credit or credit for other dependents.  Currently, about 13% of families with children receive the child and dependent care tax credit, according to a 2025 Tax Policy Center analysis. That's compared to almost 90% of families with children who receive the child tax credit. While Trump's \"big beautiful bill\" expanded both tax credits, \"there's still a lot of interest in further reforms,\" according to Garrett Watson, director of policy analysis at the Tax Foundation, a nonprofit think tank.   How the CDCTC could changeThe Republican framework aims to expand child and dependent care tax credit eligibility by removing the work requirement for both parents who file taxes jointly.If enacted, this would end the \"marriage penalty\" to support stay-at-home parents and young families, according to the outline. However, it's unclear whether Reconciliation 2.0 will happen in 2026 amid competing legislative priorities, experts say.   Typically, marriage penalties create a higher tax burden for married couples filing jointly compared to their taxes owed when filing as single individuals. watch now\"This isn't a marriage penalty like that,\" said Margot Crandall-Hollick, a principal research associate at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center. \"It is an elimination of a work requirement for moderate and higher-income married couples.\" Currently, the child and dependent care tax credit is non-refundable, which means the benefit is limited by a return's total taxes owed. Non-refundable credits are generally less beneficial to lower-income families because they typically owe little to no income taxes, said Crandall-Hollick. While there's been bipartisan interest to make the credit refundable, that change wasn't included in the final version of Trump's \"big beautiful bill,\" she said.",

    "body": "The start of 2026 means many employees are seeing their PTO balances refreshed for the year. With some strategic planning, and travel know-how, you can make your vacation days go the extra mile.One popular strategy, sometimes called \"PTO-maxxing\" on social media, involves tacking vacation days onto holidays and weekends to maximize your time off. By doing so, you can get around 40 days off by using just 10 to 15 days of PTO this year, some estimates say.Of course, PTO-maxxing may not work within everyone's schedules, team needs and employer policies. But every day you can place strategically adds up.The U.S. has 11 federal holidays this year, several of which fall on Mondays. If you request off the Friday prior or the Tuesday after, you suddenly have a 4-day getaway using just one day of PTO. Likewise, for holidays that fall on Fridays, requesting the Thursday before or the Monday after creates a 4-day vacation.The extra day can also save you some money if you're planning on traveling.\"If you can build in one vacation day on a 3-day weekend, that gives you a little bit of an advantage because you're not flying on the exact day when everybody else is flying,\" says Tom Carpenter, co-owner of travel agency Huckleberry Travel.For bigger holidays like Thanksgiving, where many people travel to be with family, you might request off Monday through Wednesday, and Friday if your employer does not already designate that a company holiday. With the two weekends on either side of Thanksgiving week, you'd have off 9 days for using 4 days of PTO.And for those who travel frequently for work, consider adding PTO onto a business trip where possible, since your company has already covered your travel and you're at that destination already, Carpenter says.Travel tipsWhen maximizing your PTO, you'll also want to bear in mind some tips to stretch your dollar too.Pay attention to events happening where and when you'll be traveling that could affect hotel and home rental availability, pricing and crowds. (If you're not expressly going to the Winter Olympics, February might be a bad time to visit Milan.)The best window to book a flight is 1.5 to 4 months out as any earlier doesn't yield any real advantages, and any later will start to see prices increase, Carpenter says. As for flying, Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Saturdays tend to be cheaper than other days, he adds.For shorter getaways, look at direct flights from your airport so you can minimize your time in transit and spend more time on the ground at your destination. Wherever you're going, plan ahead.\"If you're looking at a holiday weekend when a lot of people are going to be traveling, that inventory is going to go sooner than on a random midweek trip,\" Carpenter says. \"There's no such thing as a last-minute deal.\"Want to get ahead at work with AI?

Contributor | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesRussian President Vladimir Putin has received an invitation to join the U.S.' \"Board of Peace\" for Gaza, the Kremlin said Monday.Kremlin Spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Moscow would study the details of the proposal to join the peace council created by U.S. President Donald Trump late last year. The \"Board of Peace\" is seen as a vehicle for maintaining a fragile ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, and to oversee the reconstruction of Gaza after their protracted conflict.\"President Putin has indeed received an offer through diplomatic channels to join this Board of Peace. We are currently studying all the details of this proposal,\" Peskov told Russian state news agency TASS. \"We hope to contact the U.S. side to clarify all the details,\" he added.Trump has reportedly invited a number of world leaders, including Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney and Argentine President Javier Milei, to join the Board of Peace for Gaza, which will be part of the larger Board of Peace, Bloomberg reported Saturday.Several other nations, including Hungary, India, Jordan, Greece, Cyprus, and Pakistan confirmed Board of Peace invitations, AP News reported on Sunday.However, the Trump administration reportedly wants nations to pay $1 billion to remain on the board in perpetuity, Bloomberg noted, citing a draft charter for the proposed group.If confirmed, Putin's invitation to join the peace council would raise eyebrows given his oversight of an ongoing war against Russia's neighbor Ukraine. Hundreds of thousands of soldiers and civilians are estimated to have died in the war, which is approaching its four-year anniversary in February.CNBC has contacted the White House for confirmation of Putin's invitation.On Saturday, the U.S. also released the names of those who will sit on a \"founding Executive Board\" of the council, with the list including former U.K. Prime Minister Tony Blair, Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, and U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, among several others.Israel is unhappy with how the \"Board of Peace\" is unfolding, with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office releasing a statement on Friday commenting, \"the announcement regarding the composition of the Gaza Executive Board, which is subordinate to the Board of Peace, was not coordinated with Israel and runs contrary to its policy.\"— CNBC'S Kate Dore contributed reporting to this story.",

Ro Khanna on Friday reintroduced a bill that would curb institutional investors from buying up housing,  leveraging a similar call made recently by President Donald Trump.Trump said in a Truth Social post on Jan. 7 that he would be \"immediately taking steps to ban large institutional investors from buying more single-family homes.\"Trump's remark was one of a flurry of populist economic moves by the president as he races to address voter concerns about affordability ahead of the 2026 midterm elections.A recent Marist poll found that just 36% of Americans approved of Trump's handling of the economy, while 57% disapproved. That is a significant headwind for Trump's fellow Republicans in Congress as they try to hang onto their razor-thin majorities in the House of Representatives and Senate.In a statement to CNBC, Khanna invoked Trump's recent support for blocking institutional investors from buying up housing. \"If President Trump is serious about taking on Wall Street landlords, Congress should pass my bill and he should sign it into law,\" Khanna said. \"Homes should be owned by people, not wealthy corporate landlords who are buying up single-family homes and pushing the dream of homeownership out of reach for too many Americans.\" Read more CNBC politics coverageRussia watches as ally Iran edges closer to collapse.

Kelly sues DOD Sec. Hegseth, says he was punished for 'disfavored political speech'GOP Sen. Thom Tillis vows to block Trump's Fed nominees following Powell probeWhile bill text was not immediately available, Khanna's office told CNBC that the Stop Wall Street Landlords Act would prohibit large institutional investors from taking advantage of home-related tax breaks, including mortgage interest, insurance and depreciation deductions. The bill would also require federal and government-backed agencies such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to prohibit large institutional investors from purchasing mortgages on single-family homes. Large Institutional investors who sell single-family homes more than 18 months after the bill's enactment would be slapped with a real estate transfer tax equal to 100% of the home's sale value. In prior versions of the bill, including one introduced in late 2024, a large institutional investor was defined as a person or firm with assets exceeding $100 million. Khanna has 13 cosponsors on the bill so far, all Democrats. But it's possible that Trump's call for an end to large investors in the single-family home market may prompt some House GOP members to join Khanna's effort.In an interview with CNBC, Khanna said he's willing to work with Trump on legislation \"if it's actually going to help the working class.\" \"If he calls me up, I'll help lead the bill,\" Khanna said. Trump is set to speak at the World Economic Forum in Davos on Wednesday, where the president said he will address his housing proposal. \"I will discuss this topic, including further Housing and Affordability proposals, and more, at my speech in Davos,\" Trump said on Truth Social.",

    "body": "Twenty47studio | Moment | Getty ImagesTax changes for 2026 offer new ways for individuals ages 65 and over to plan financially.That is largely due to a new temporary senior \"bonus\" or deduction of up to $6,000 per qualifying individual that was enacted when President Donald Trump signed the \"big beautiful bill\" package into law last July. A married couple filing jointly could qualify for a deduction of up to $12,000.The $6,000 senior deduction is in effect from tax years 2025 through 2028. It applies to taxpayers 65 and over, regardless of whether they itemize their tax returns or take the standard deduction. Retirees may not have made full use of the break since it was implemented partway through last year, experts say, but the next three years of planning could be key.\"This three-year window is an incredible, valuable opportunity,\" said Miklos Ringbauer, a certified public accountant and founder and principal of MiklosCPA Inc., an accounting and tax strategy firm in Southern California.\"It's three times $12,000, plus adjusted for inflation,\" Ringbauer said. \"That's a lot of savings that we can build in for further down the road.\" Read more CNBC personal finance coverageUnexpected expenses take 10% of retirees' income, on average, research showsMore employers worry about workers' financial wellbeing, research showsRepublicans want to end the 'marriage penalty' for this childcare tax creditEducation Department to delay collections on defaulted student loansTrump pitches direct payments for health care.

However, because it is not a tax credit, they will not necessarily receive those sums back in their refunds.The impact of the deduction could be vast, Bill Sweeney, senior vice president of government affairs at AARP, said during a Jan. 15 briefing on the tax changes.The Council of Economic Advisers, an agency within the executive office of the president, estimates about 33.9 million seniors may qualify for the new senior deduction and receive an average $670 increase in after-tax income per eligible taxpayer.\"That's four years of immediate relief at a time when older Americans are facing really high costs,\" Sweeney said.Who qualifies for the new $6,000 senior deductionSeniors must have a modified adjusted gross income under certain thresholds to qualify for the full deduction — up to $75,000 if single or $150,000 if married and filing taxes jointly. The deduction is gradually reduced for taxpayers with incomes over those thresholds and fully phases out for individuals with $175,000 or more in income and married couples with $250,000.On the campaign trail, Trump pitched eliminating taxes on Social Security benefits. Yet because the law was passed by a legislative process known as reconciliation, Republican lawmakers could not directly make that change. Instead, the new senior deduction is aimed at replacing the income that any federal taxes on Social Security benefits may take away. Federal taxes on Social Security benefits that are still in effect make it so beneficiaries may face levies on a formula called combined income — the sum of adjusted gross income, nontaxable interest and half of Social Security benefits. Up to 50% of Social Security benefits are taxable for individuals with $25,000 to $34,000 in combined income, and married couples who file jointly with between $32,000 and $44,000. Up to 85% of benefits are taxable for individuals with more than $34,000 in combined income and married couples with over $44,000.   The \"big beautiful\" tax package includes other tax changes that individuals ages 65 and over may take advantage of — a higher standard deduction and state and local tax deduction, a deduction of up to $10,000 per taxpayer for interest on new auto loans, plus no tax on tips or overtime pay for those who are still working.\"With tax changes come tax planning opportunities,\" said Joe Elsasser, a certified financial planner and president of Covisum, a Social Security claiming software company. Senior deduction as a four-year planning opportunityNotably, the new $6,000 senior deduction applies to individuals 65 and over, whether they have claimed Social Security benefits or not, Elsasser said. \"Don't just focus on the temporary additional senior deduction as a reduction of Social Security tax,\" Elsasser said. \"Instead, think of it as a four-year additional deduction that could be applied against any kind of income.\"The new change went into effect with the 2025 tax year. Yet some individuals may not have been mindful of their taxable income for the year with the new senior deduction in mind, according to Ringbauer.For example, if taxpayers ages 65 and over had a very successful year in the stock market in 2025, they may be phased out of the full deduction that could have been available to them, Ringbauer said.For tax years 2026 and beyond, older individuals may want to focus on how to stay within the deduction's income limits, he said.Individuals who are age 65 and up and still working may be able to reduce their taxable income by contributing to a retirement plan. In 2026, individuals ages 50 and older may be able to contribute up to $32,500 to a 401(k)-retirement plan, including catch-up contributions. Individuals ages 60 to 63 may be able to set aside up to $35,750, with super catch-up contributions.Older taxpayers may also consider reducing their taxable income through charitable contributions.watch nowIndividuals ages 65 and older also want to be aware of other potential sources of income — such as required minimum distributions or Roth conversions — that may affect the size of their taxable income and therefore eligibility for the senior deduction, Ringbauer said.The new senior deduction will reduce taxes on other income, not just Social Security, according to Elsasser.Consequently, for taxpayers who have financial flexibility, it may make sense to withdraw money from IRAs or other retirement accounts while the temporary deduction is in place, he said. Those withdrawals may also help reduce required minimum distributions later, which can also help limit retirees' future income subject to taxes. Notably, that strategy may also help individuals ages 65 and over to delay claiming Social Security retirement benefits. Delaying Social Security provides a guaranteed return of 8% per year from full retirement age — typically age 66 or 67 — up to age 70.Those who have already claimed Social Security retirement benefits and who have reached full retirement age may consider voluntarily suspending their monthly checks while the senior bonus is in effect to let their future monthly benefit checks grow, Elsasser said.

    "body": "U.S. President Donald Trump speaks to members of the press before boarding Marine One on the South Lawn of the White House on Jan. 16, 2026 in Washington, DC.Tom Brenner | Getty ImagesU.S. President Donald Trump has threatened a rising wave of tariffs on several European allies, raising the alarm for industries and businesses across the region.Trump on Saturday pledged to impose 10% tariffs on the U.K., Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, the Netherlands, and Finland by Feb. 1, ramping up his push to make Greenland, a self-governing Danish territory, a part of the United States. The levy on these countries will rise to 25% from June 1, Trump said. European political leaders are set to hold emergency talks over the coming days as they consider their response, with retaliatory measures and broader punitive economic policies reportedly on the table. CNBC takes a look at some of the sectors expected to be the most exposed to Trump's tariff threats.AutosEurope's car giants, which were hit hard by Trump's back-and-forth trade policies last year, are considered to be highly exposed once again.The automotive sector is widely regarded as acutely vulnerable to levies, particularly given the high globalization of supply chains and the heavy reliance on manufacturing operations across North America. Germany's Volkswagen, BMW, and Mercedes-Benz Group were all trading more than 2.5% lower on Monday morning, with Milan-listed Stellantis last seen down by around 2.1%.watch nowMohit Kumar, chief European economist at Jefferies, said Trump's tariffs clearly represent a negative development for Germany's economic outlook, a country traditionally seen as Europe's growth engine.\"If we do get tariffs, and, of course, we have to see how the geopolitical situation pans out, then … the chemicals, industrials, autos sectors, these will be the most impacted, which directly feeds to German growth,\" Kumar told CNBC's \"Europe Early Edition\" on Monday. Of the eight European countries threatened by Trump's Greenland tariffs, Germany, by far, enjoys the greatest trade surplus with the U.S., followed by France and the U.K., according to data from Eurostat, the EU's statistical office.LuxuryLuxury stocks were seen as largely sheltered from U.S.-EU trade tensions in the first quarter of last year, given their robust pricing power and ability to pass on added costs to consumers. Analysts warned at the time, however, that the prospect of tariffs ushering in a broader economic downturn could have spillover effects, even for the wealthiest shoppers. A Christian Dior luxury store in Paris on July 22, 2025.Cyril Marcilhacy/Bloomberg via Getty ImagesAlongside seven other European countries, Trump's proposed tariffs single out France, which is home to the likes of industry bellwether LVMH and Kering. Shares of LVMH and Kering fell around 3.5% and 2.6% on Monday morning. Luxury groups, including Switzerland's Richemont, Italy's Brunello Cucinelli, and Britain's Burberry, were also trading lower. Pharma Europe's pharma sector could face a significant impact from the proposed U.S. tariffs, given that medicines and pharma products represent the EU's largest export to the U.S. EU exports of pharma products to the U.S. came in at 84.4 billion euros ($98.1 billion) during the first three quarters of last year, ahead of machinery and mechanical parts (68.3 billion euros) and organic chemicals (66.3 billion euros) over the same period, according to Eurostat data. Read moreSome of the sector's biggest European names fell slightly on Trump's latest tariff threats on Monday morning.  Denmark's Novo Nordisk was 2.1% lower, Switzerland's Roche dipped 0.3% lower, and France's Sanofi fell 0.9% during early deals. Swiss-based Novartis, meanwhile, traded 0.3% higher.  Energy  Europe's oil and gas stocks could also be indirectly impacted by Trump's latest tariff threats, due to factors such as weaker global demand, lower crude prices and increased supply chain costs.Oil prices were last seen trading slightly lower amid heightened concerns of a trade war between the U.S. and Europe — and what this could mean for global demand.Norway's Equinor was among the energy stocks leading the sector's losses on Monday, down around 3.4%. France's TotalEnergies, Britain's Shell, and BP fell between 1% and 1.5%, respectively.Storage tanks at the Northern Lights carbon capture and storage project, controlled by Equinor ASA, Shell Plc and TotalEnergies SE, at Blomoyna, Norway, on Friday, Jan. 19, 2024.Bloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesOzan Özkural, founder and managing partner at Tanto Capital, said Trump's latest tariff threats should not have been unexpected, warning of a broad impact for European sectors.\"Welcome to 2026. I think this is going to be the sort of year that we are going to talk a lot more about what it means not to have the U.S. play ball with the traditional allies,\" Özkural told CNBC's \"Squawk Box Europe\" on Monday.\"It's going to have an impact on oil prices, commodity prices, equity markets, debt markets, private credit.

    "body": "An aerial view of the town ahead of World Economic Forum (WEF), also known as Davos Summit in Davos, Switzerland on January 14, 2024.Anadolu | Anadolu | Getty ImagesJ.P. Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang are among the who's who of political leaders, big-name CEOs and tech pioneers heading to Davos, Switzerland for the World Economic Forum's annual meeting.U.S. President Donald Trump is also attending in person for the first time since he addressed the forum during his first term in 2020. His virtual address last year, days after reentering the White House, shook the event. This time, he will bring the \"largest\" U.S. delegation yet, according to WEF.Davos organizers are keen to talk up the numbers they expect to attend — \"close to 3,000 cross-sector leaders,\" plus a \"record\" 400 political leaders, 850 top company bosses and 100 tech pioneers. But a government at the center of a geopolitical firestorm won't be there.Danish government representatives were invited and decided not to attend, a WEF spokesperson said on Monday, as the dispute over Greenland intensified. Their decision underscores how tense the meeting is likely to be, coming just days after Trump announced fresh tariffs on European countries resisting his attempt to annex the Arctic island. \"Any decisions on attendance are a matter for the government concerned. We can confirm that the Danish government will not be represented in Davos this week,\" the WEF spokesperson said in a statement.There are big names among those who aren't going.Chinese President Xi Jinping is not on WEF's attendance list, neither are the leaders of Brazil and India. U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer and Italy's leader Giorgia Meloni are not on the WEF list, although both are reported to be attending.Big economic powersDuring a press conference last week, WEF organizers highlighted that six of the G7 nations are expected to send representatives, in a \"historic\" move, according to WEF's president, Børge Brende. In 2025, the only G7 leader attending Davos in person was then-German Chancellor Olaf Scholz.Alongside President Trump, French President Emmanuel Macron, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, and German Chancellor Friedrich Merz are set to attend in person.

In an emergency press conference on Monday morning, Starmer addressed Trump's announcement of escalating tariffs targeting several European countries, including the U.K., if Greenland isn't sold to the U.S. But when asked by the BBC whether he would consider meeting Trump in person \"this week,\" Starmer did not directly answer the question.U.K. Finance Minister Rachel Reeves is set to attend and be a guest on CNBC's \"Squawk Box Europe\" on Wednesday.Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi isn't mentioned on WEF's list, but she is likely to remain in her country, given that she announced on Monday a snap election for Feb. 8.'More of the CEOs'Davos runs from Monday evening to Friday morning. This year's theme is \"A spirit of dialogue,\" with an agenda focusing on five areas: the geopolitical environment, AI, climate and nature, new sources of economic growth and \"people and preparedness.\"But the interest will be in who will attend Davos, according to Eric Kutcher, a senior partner at McKinsey & Company, a \"strategic partner\" to WEF. \"It's going to be about who is there,\" he said in a video published by the company. \"Much more so than what you see in the topics,\" Kutcher said.Trump's delegation is set to include U.S Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, plus Middle East special envoy Steve Witkoff and adviser Jared Kushner. The president is scheduled to address Davos on Wednesday.U.S. President Donald Trump on screen during his address by video conference at the World Economic Forum annual meeting in Davos on Jan. 23, 2025. Fabrice Coffrini | Afp | Getty ImagesWEF's founder, Klaus Schwab, is one big name who won't be at Davos. After running the event for decades, Schwab stepped down in April following an investigation into alleged misconduct. He was subsequently cleared of \"material wrongdoing.\"BlackRock CEO Larry Fink and Roche vice-chair Andre Hoffman were announced as WEF's interim co-chairs in August, and the organization's new personnel are \"making a real push to kind of re-instil the economic orientation of WEF, and in doing so, bringing more of the CEOs,\" Kutcher said. Alongside Nvidia's Huang, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei and DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis are on WEF's attendance list. Sarah Friar, OpenAI's chief financial officer, is also set to participate, but the company's CEO, Sam Altman, is not down to attend.Key topics for markets include U.S. moves towards a Greenland takeover, political turmoil in Venezuela and the threat by Trump to use force against Iran. Investors will also be watching for announcements from AI firms, central bank updates, and news about companies diversifying away from the U.S.While some big-name politicians aren't attending, some of the leaders who are going — such as Argentina's Javier Milei and Indonesia's Prabowo Subianto — are \"no small figures,\" according to Jan Aart Scholte, professor of global transformations and governance challenges at Leiden University in the Netherlands.Argentina's President Javier Milei delivers a speech at the World Economic Forum (WEF) meeting in Davos on January 17, 2024. (Photo by Fabrice COFFRINI / AFP) (Photo by FABRICE COFFRINI/AFP via Getty Images)Fabrice Coffrini | Afp | Getty ImagesGovernments still see Davos as a place to meet with businesses, he added. \"Global capital remains a strong force in world politics, even if big multinational enterprises are generally less embraced and celebrated than 20-30 years ago,\" he told CNBC in an email Monday.Who's not on the listWhile WEF said there are \"close to\" 65 heads of state expected to attend, plus key figures such as European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, other big names are not on the list.Brazil's President Lula da Silva and India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi are not scheduled to give addresses. But Brende described India's delegation as \"strong,\" and noted that the heads of state of other Asian economies, including Indonesia and Pakistan, would attend.While China's President Xi is not expected to attend, Brende said a \"big\" Chinese delegation would attend, including trade and finance Vice Premier He Lifeng, who is due to address the event on Tuesday.Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the de facto ruler of his nation, is not on WEF's attendance list. But several of the country's ministers, including Finance Minister Mohammed Al Jadaan, are scheduled to be interviewed by CNBC during the event.Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said on Monday he would no longer attend after two high-speed trains collided in the south of the country on Sunday, killing 39 people.A former Davos critic makes an appearanceNigel Farage, leader of the right-wing Reform UK, is expected to attend the event this year. Farage previously called Davos \"elite\" and said those attending were \"people deciding our futures in Swiss ski resorts\" in a 2020 video. Indeed, Davos has been seen by some as elitist and out-of-touch, Scholte said. \"Nationalist-populist circles commonly view the WEF as a beacon of a liberal globalist elite that draws their ire,\" he told CNBC via email.- CNBC's Leonie Kidd contributed to this report.",

    "body": "Jamie Dimon, Chairman and CEO, JPMorganChase, speaks during the Reagan National Defense Forum at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley, California, U.S. December 6, 2025.  Jonathan Alcorn | ReutersPresident Donald Trump on Saturday threatened to sue JPMorgan Chase over allegedly \"debanking\" him following the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol. \"I'll be suing JPMorgan Chase over the next two weeks for incorrectly and inappropriately DEBANKING me after the January 6th Protest, a protest that turned out to be correct for those doing the protesting,\" Trump said in a social media post. \"The Election was RIGGED!\"\"While we won't get specific about a client, we don't close accounts because of political beliefs,\" said JPMorgan spokesperson Trish Wexler. \"We appreciate that this Administration has moved to address political debanking and we support those efforts.\"In August, Trump signed an executive order requiring banks to ensure they are not refusing financial services to clients based on religious or political beliefs, a practice known as \"debanking.\" Trump claimed without evidence in an August CNBC interview that he was personally discriminated against by banks. He said JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America refused to take his deposits following his first term in office. At the time, JPMorgan said it does not close accounts for political reasons, while Bank of America said it doesn't comment on client matters. BofA also said it would welcome clearer rules from regulators on how to conduct its activities.Trump and his family have a history of railing against financial institutions for allegedly refusing to work with them on the basis of their political orientation. Last year, Donald Trump Jr. said his family had difficulty accessing big bank services — a situation that allegedly prompted the Trumps to enter the cryptocurrency industry. \"So, [my family] got into crypto, not because it was like, 'hey, this is the next cool thing,' we got into it out of necessity,\" Trump Jr. told CNBC in an interview last June.JPMorgan shares are down about 5% over the past week, even after the bank on Tuesday topped expectations for its fourth-quarter earnings and revenue. The shares, and others in the banking sector, fell in response to Trump's demand to cap credit card rates at 10%, giving financial firms until Jan. 20 to comply.Trump's legal threat against JPMorgan comes as the president, in the same Truth Social post, denied a Journal report on Wednesday that said the president had offered JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon the position of Federal Reserve chairman months ago during a meeting at the White House. Dimon took the proposition as a joke, according to the Journal report.In his post, Trump denied the report, underscoring his reservations about Dimon and JPMorgan. \"This statement is totally untrue, there was never such an offer,\" he wrote. \"Why wouldn't The Wall Street Journal call me to ask whether or not such an offer was made? I would have very quickly told them, \"NO,\" and that would have been the end of the story.\"JPMorgan's Wexler said the \"offer\" reported by the Journal was a miscommunication. \"I should have been more vigilant in correcting that word while attempting to dispute the WSJ's anonymous sources,\" she said.The Journal did not immediately respond to a request for comment sent outside of normal business hours. Current Fed Chairman Jerome Powell's term ends on May 15.",

    "description": "One thing many workers are keen to leave behind heading into 2026? The 9-to-5 schedule. In its place, many are interested in adopting a practice calle",
    "body": "One thing many workers are keen to leave behind heading into 2026? The 9-to-5 schedule. In its place, many are interested in adopting a practice called \"microshifting.\"In Owl Labs' 2025 State of Hybrid Work report, 65% of workers reported being interested in microshifting, defined as working in \"short, non-linear blocks based on personal energy, responsibilities, or productivity patterns.\"\"Microshifting appeals to employees not just as a scheduling preference, but as a way to reclaim control over their increasingly fragmented work lives,\" Owl Labs CEO Frank Weishaupt tells CNBC Make It. \"Employees are improvising solutions to reconcile the demands of their jobs with the realities of their lives.\"During the pandemic remote work boom, many workers had greater control over their time during their workdays. The interest in microshifting could represent interest in keeping that flexibility, particularly among those with some degree of remote or self-directed work, as it may be more difficult for office workers in traditional 9-to-5 jobs.But microshifting isn't an entirely new practice. Doug Gregory of Grand Rapids, Michigan, says he's been doing it as a remote worker for decades, before it had that name, and even more so since the Covid-19 pandemic.\"We kind of got used to the idea of being present or available for loved ones,\" he says of broader sentiment in the workforce stemming from the pandemic remote work era. \"We got used to taking better care of our health.\"While Gregory acknowledges that \"not everybody has control over their calendar,\" he finds \"the day is more fluid\" when he's microshifting.\"If I need to take an hour off during the day to go do something with the grandkid or to go see a doctor or whatever, it's okay, I make up for it in the evening, I make up for it early in the morning,\" he says. \"It really comes back to what am I responsible for getting done, how do I do it, and how do I organize my life to do it.\"Gregory previously held sales roles but today is self-employed working in audiovisual integration.\"I earn a living based on outcomes,\" he says. \"Nobody sends me a check for how many hours I work in a week.\"Microshifting could be particularly useful for parents and caregivers; Owl Labs' report found caregivers were roughly three times as likely to try microshifting as non-caregivers.Theresa Robertson of Elkridge, Maryland, is one of them. Robertson says she juggled her work, including a former role as a project manager, with caregiving for her late husband, who had chronic health issues, for 25 years.\"To me, it was just making sure I didn't lose my job,\" she says. \"I had to take care of my husband, and I had to work, so I had to figure it out.\"That meant scheduling meetings around his doctors' appointments and starting some days early or ending others late to take him to those appointments, manage his medications and handle other caregiving responsibilities.\"We had a routine; after I got him settled, made sure he was dressed and he had his medicine and he had his food, then I could relax and focus on work,\" she says. \"I had more control over my day where I could stop and decide, okay I need to check his blood pressure and then go back to work.\"Some of her jobs during this period, like in project management, were more outcome-based so she was trusted to manage her time as long as she handled her work, she notes.\"As long as I got the job done on time and on budget, they weren't really looking at did I punch a clock to see was I in the building at 7 a.m.\" she says. \"I've had so many Zoom meetings in hospital rooms because wherever I go I take my laptop and when I can work, I can work.\"Today, Robertson runs a virtual assistant agency, which she says helps her continue to microshift. She sets her hours such that she's mostly free on Friday afternoons, for example, to tend to personal matters.\"I microshift all the time,\" she says. \"That's the only way I'm able to have a life and produce an income.\"Want to get ahead at work with AI?

    "description": "Candidates often worry about making a good impression during the hiring process, but they should be equally attuned to how the company presents itself",
    "body": "Candidates often worry about making a good impression during the hiring process, but they should be equally attuned to how the company presents itself.Don't ignore your intuition if something seems off during a job interview, says Amanda Augustine, a career coach and resident career expert at Resume.ai.\"The candidate experience is oftentimes a reflection of how they treat their employees and the respect they give,\" Augustine says. No matter how great a job looks on paper, \"if it's not a great experience interviewing with them and going through their vetting process, then chances are it's probably not going to be a wonderful experience once you get in the door,\" she says.These are the top three red flags from hirers that job seekers should watch out for in interviews, according to Augustine.The hiring team doesn't have a clear idea of what the role entailsIt's a major red flag if each person you speak to during the interview process \"seems to have a different idea in mind as to what they expect you to do\" in the role, Augustine says.From the company's side, everyone involved in the hiring process should have similar responses to questions like \"What does success look like in this role?\" or \"What are the top three qualifications someone needs to do this job?\" If the hiring team is unclear on what your exact job duties will be, which team members you'll work with or what your role will be within the company, you're likely to face unrealistic or unclear expectations as an employee, according to Augustine.These inconsistencies can also point to larger issues in the company's culture, she says.It could indicate that there's \"conflict within the organization\" as to what they're looking for, Augustine says — and \"if you take the job, you're going to be stuck in the middle of that.\"They avoid answering hard questionsJob interviews are a two-way street, Augustine says: candidates are evaluating whether they want to work at a company just as much as employers are evaluating whether to hire them.If there are any areas of concern, candidates can — and should — ask probing questions like \"It seems like there was a large layoff in the past year. How has the team recovered from that, and how has that changed your goals?\"Pay attention to the way your interviewer responds, Augustine says.\"If they shy away from that, refuse to answer or they don't want to get into it, it's either because they don't know the answer or they think the answer will scare you away,\" she says. \"I would be wary of that.\"It can also be a red flag if your interviewer is reluctant to let you speak with current team members, she says: they may be trying to hide a toxic work environment.The work environment seems tenseIf you're visiting the company for an in-person interview, it's crucial to \"take stock of your surroundings,\" Augustine says.\"Keep your eyes and ears peeled for what's going on around you,\" she says.She recommends taking note of details like \"Where are they having you wait? What's the vibe around you? Do people seem stressed out? Is it silent? Is it happy?\"Even something as simple as what workers keep on their desks could give you valuable insights into the company culture, she says: \"Do they have plants and pictures of their families and that sort of thing, or is it very sterile?\"Another clue to look out for is whether other employees seem to collaborate or keep to themselves.These factors don't necessarily indicate that a workplace is toxic, Augustine says, but they can help candidates determine whether the company culture is a good fit. If not, \"you'll want to run for the door,\" she says.How candidates can respondIf you've decided that you're no longer interested in pursuing the role, it's best to let the company know promptly.It can feel awkward to tell a company you're withdrawing your candidacy, but Augustine recommends sending a follow-up email with a simple script:\"Thank you so much for your time today. I enjoyed learning more about your organization. Upon further consideration, I do not believe that this role would be a good fit for me. I wish you the best of luck in your candidate search.\"Regardless of how the interview went, \"you're always going to maintain your dignity, your honor, your professionalism,\" Augustine says.Want to get ahead at work with AI?

    "body": "Sarah Friar, CFO of OpenAI, appears on CNBC's Squawk Box on August 20, 2025. CNBCOpenAI will make 2026 its year of \"practical adoption,\" the artificial intelligence startup's finance chief said in a blog Sunday. \"The priority is closing the gap between what AI now makes possible and how people, companies, and countries are using it day to day,\" OpenAI CFO Sarah Friar wrote. \"The opportunity is large and immediate, especially in health, science, and enterprise, where better intelligence translates directly into better outcomes.\"In the blog, Friar laid out how OpenAI views its strategy for driving monetization of its services, like ChatGPT, while securing the compute necessary to power those products, saying that the AI lab's revenue directly tracks with the availability of its technical infrastructure. OpenAI's compute grew from 0.2 gigawatts in 2023 to about 1.9 GW in 2025, while the company's annual revenue run rate grew similarly from $2 billion in 2023 to more than $20 billion last year, Friar said. \"This is never-before-seen growth at such scale,\" she wrote. \"And we firmly believe that more compute in these periods would have led to faster customer adoption and monetization.\"Friar's blog comes as OpenAI and the tech industry's focus on AI comes under scrutiny for the massive investments necessary to build out the data centers and secure the energy and components required to power this cutting-edge technology that has yet to deliver much revenue returns for investors. Among those key deals is an agreement between OpenAI and AI chipmaker Nvidia announced in September. Under that agreement, Nvidia said it would commit $100 billion to support the AI startup as it builds and deploys at least 10 GW of Nvidia's systems.A gigawatt is a measure of power, and 10 GW is roughly equivalent to the annual power consumption of 8 million U.S. households, according to a CNBC analysis of data from the Energy Information Administration.But in November, Nvidia told investors there was \"no assurance\" that its agreement with OpenAI would progress beyond an announcement and to an official contract stage. \"Securing world-class compute requires commitments made years in advance, and growth does not move in a perfectly smooth line,\" wrote Friar, adding that the system requires discipline. Three years ago, OpenAI relied on a single compute provider, but now it works with a diversified ecosystem, Friar said. \"We can plan, finance, and deploy capacity with confidence in a market where access to compute defines who can scale,\" she wrote. OpenAI's business model should scale with its services, Friar said. \"As intelligence moves into scientific research, drug discovery, energy systems, and financial modeling, new economic models will emerge,\" she wrote. The blog comes after OpenAI last week said that it planned to begin testing ads for some ChatGPT users in the U.S. That move comes as OpenAI gears up for a potential public debut this year. \"Monetization should feel native to the experience,\" Friar wrote. \"If it does not add value, it does not belong.\"WATCH: OpenAI Investor Letter: Weekly and daily active user figures 'continue to produce all-time highs'watch now",

    "body": "Greenlandic Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen addresses people protesting against U.S. President Donald Trump and his announced intent to acquire Greenland on January 17, 2026 in Nuuk, Greenland.Sean Gallup | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesGreenland Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen said Monday that the Arctic island would not be pressured over U.S. President Donald Trump's tariff threats. His comments come shortly after Nielsen joined protesters in Nuuk, Greenland's capital, over the weekend, where people marched to demonstrate against Trump's push to take control of the self-governing Danish territory.On Saturday, the U.S. president threatened to impose a rising wave of tariffs against eight European countries for their opposition to his campaign.European political leaders called the proposed tariffs \"unacceptable\" and vowed to stand behind Denmark, which is responsible for the island's foreign, defense, and security policies.In a social media post, Greenland's Nielsen said the recent demonstrations in Greenland and in Denmark had shown \"a strong and dignified unity.\"He also welcomed support from other European leaders, saying it shows a \"clear recognition\" that Greenland had the right to make its own decisions.\"The latest statements from the US, including threats of tariffs, do not change that line. We will not be pressured. We stand firm on dialogue, on respect and on international law,\" Nielsen said in a Facebook post, according to a Google translation.watch nowTrump, who has long coveted making Greenland a part of the U.S., renewed his interest in the vast and mineral-rich territory following an audacious U.S. military operation in Venezuela on Jan. 3.The U.S. president has said that the U.S. needs the sparsely populated island for national security reasons, citing concerns about Russia and China's Arctic influence and recently telling reporters that Washington would acquire the self-governing Danish territory \"one way or the other.\"As part of this push, Trump has pledged to impose 10% tariffs on the U.K., Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, the Netherlands, and Finland from Feb. 1 if they oppose his bid to buy Greenland.The levy on these countries will rise to 25% from June 1, Trump said.European leaders are expected to meet in the coming days as they consider their response, which reportedly could include retaliatory tariffs and broader punitive economic counter-measures against the U.S.",

    "body": "Pedestrians in the Huaqiangbei electronics market area in Shenzhen, China, on Wednesday, Jan. 14, 2026. Qilai Shen | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesChina's economic growth slowed to its weakest pace in nearly three years in the fourth quarter as domestic demand softened, though full-year growth matched Beijing's target despite growing trade frictions with the U.S. and a prolonged real estate slump.  Gross domestic product grew 4.5% in the October-to-December period, data from the National Statistics Bureau showed Monday. That marked a slowdown from 4.8% in the third quarter and was the weakest reading since the first quarter of 2023, when growth also came in at 4.5%. Full-year economic output came in at 5%, meeting the official target of around 5%. Separate December data showed domestic consumption weakened and the investment decline steepened, while manufacturing improved. Retail sales grew 0.9% in December from a year earlier, missing economists' forecast for 1.2% growth and slowing from 1.3% in the prior month. That marked the softest growth since December 2022, according to Wind Information, when the gauge of consumption declined 1.8% year on year.  Industrial output climbed 5.2% in December, topping expectations for a 5% growth and up from 4.8% in the previous month.  Fixed-asset investment, which includes real estate, contracted 3.8% last year, worse than economists' forecast for a 3% drop in a Reuters poll. Investment in property development continued to decline as a real estate crisis dragged on, falling 17.2% in 2025, deepening from the 10.6% drop in 2024. The urban unemployment rate remained unchanged at 5.1% in December. The mainland Chinese CSI 300 rose 0.6% following the data release before paring back gains, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index dipped 0.8%. The offshore yuan rose slightly to 6.9604 against the U.S. dollar, its strongest level since May 2023, according to LSEG data. \"We must adopt more proactive and effective macro policies (and) continue to expand domestic demand,\" the statistics bureau said in an official English language release. Supply-demand imbalanceThe world's second-largest economy showed resilience in 2025, largely helped by lower-than-expected tariff rates and exporters' push to diversify away from the U.S., allowing policymakers to delay launching large-scale stimulus. China reported a record trade surplus of nearly $1.2 trillion last year, driven by surging exports to non-U.S. markets as manufacturers redirected shipments to avoid higher U.S. tariffs.The anticipated drag from front-loaded shipments, tighter transshipment controls and currency appreciation has been limited, said Tommy Xie, managing director of OCBC Bank. Xie expects China's exports to grow around 3% in 2026. China's net exports accounted for nearly one-third of its GDP in 2025, while consumption contributed 52% to the economic output, statistics bureau director Kang Yi told reporters Monday. Exports continued to face headwinds. U.S. President Donald Trump has threatened a 25% tariff on countries doing business with Iran, including China, and the trade truce with Washington is set to expire later this year. China's staggering trade imbalance has also drawn criticism from trading partners seeking to shield domestic industries from an influx of cheap Chinese goods.Economists have called for economic reforms to shift the growth model toward domestic consumption and reduce reliance on exports and investment, warning that the current growth model poses long-term risks. \"Plunging investment and weak household consumption have made the Chinese economy increasingly reliant on exports to power growth, a situation that is untenable for China as well as the world economy,\" said Eswar Prasad, a professor of trade policy and economics at Cornell University.Beijing has sought to rein in excess industrial capacity and curb aggressive price wars. Consumer inflation accelerated to 0.8% in December, the fastest pace in nearly three years, while producer prices dropped 1.9%.Still, China's GDP deflator, the broadest measure of prices across goods and services, has remained negative since 2023 and is expected to fall by 0.5% in 2026 in the longest streak on record, according to Larry Hu, chief China economist at Macquarie.The economy continues to struggle with weak domestic spending amid a prolonged property slump and persistent deflationary strains. New bank loans shrank to a seven-year low of 16.27 trillion yuan ($2.33 trillion) in 2025, underscoring sluggish borrowing demand and piling pressure on the government to provide more stimulus.The People's Bank of China last week announced a package of credit-easing measures, including a 25-basis-point cut in rates on various lending tools and increasing quotas for lending programs targeting key sectors such as agriculture, technology and private enterprises.Economists at Goldman Sachs expect the central bank to cut the reserve requirement ratio by 50 basis points and the policy rate by 10 basis points in the first quarter.watch now",

    "body": "The Tether (USDT) stablecoin logo.Costfoto | Nurphoto | Getty ImagesAmid the U.S. military intervention in Venezuela, locals rushed to secure their savings by converting their bolívares to dollar-pegged digital tokens called USDT. The timing of the attack may have been surprising to some, but Venezuelans subsequent embrace of stablecoins wasn't. From the Middle East to Latin America, ordinary people are turning to USDT to hide and preserve their wealth from authoritative regimes and shield themselves against hyperinflation. And now, with U.S. President Donald Trump threatening to intervene in local affairs in Colombia and Iran, that survival strategy could gain even greater traction. \"Stablecoins are better dollars, but the reason people get them is out of necessity and out of self-preservation,\" Mauricio Di Bartolomeo, co-founder of digital asset lender Ledn, told CNBC.  \"Wherever they have limitations around dollars flowing freely, stablecoins are going to bust through the door.\"Since 2014, the digital currency issued by stablecoin giant Tether has become increasingly common in Russia, Iran and other emerging economies, particularly in times of heightened political instability, according to Di Bartolomeo. Using USDT, people can send and receive remittances, protect their money from local currency debasement and pay for goods and services. Not so stable? Although USDT may sound like a perfect solution to using \"virtually worthless\" fiat such as the Iranian rial and the Venezuelan bolívar, the token — like most things — isn't perfect, Di Bartolomeo noted. While stablecoins like USDT are designed to always be equal to $1, their prices don't always remain stable, particularly when demand rises. Earlier this month, demand for USDT surged due to the U.S. attack on Venezuela, causing the token to trade as high as roughly $1.40 on some peer-to-peer exchanges. That fluctuation in cost underscores ongoing liquidity issues in the cryptocurrency market that have hindered mass digital assets adoption. However, it also speaks to the extent to which virtual currencies are looked to as an \"escape valve\" among individuals living under extreme political and economic conditions, Haonan Li, co-founder and CEO of stablecoin infrastructure firm Codex, told CNBC.  \"This was a violent repricing driven by fear,\" Li said. \"As confidence in the bolívar collapsed, demand for dollars via Tether exploded, pushing the peer-to-peer USDT price in Venezuela up roughly 40% almost overnight.\"He added that the event wasn't caused by speculative activity among retail traders. Rather, \"they were trying to get out of fiat as fast as possible,\" in an emergency situation, Li said. \"That surge in demand created arbitrage opportunities, but more importantly it highlighted how stablecoins function as a real-time safety rail in emerging markets when traditional systems crack,\" he added.The situation temporarily hurt some Venezuelans attempting to secure their savings via a digital, dollarized solution, forcing them to pay a premium to convert their bolívares to USDT. And, that's one of just a few potential risks stablecoins could pose.  Converting high volumes of fiat to dollar-pegged stablecoins leads to high capital outflows, which could contribute to local currency depreciation, Zero Knowledge Consulting CEO Austin Campbell told CNBC.\"If you have a very repressive regime that's been, to put it bluntly, being s--- to all of its citizens, giving everybody a way to get their money out from under the regime so they can do whatever the hell they want could cause the local currency to collapse,\" said Campbell, who is also an adjunct professor at NYU.  However, that kind of situation isn't always a bad thing, the stablecoin expert noted. Local currency depreciation can also serve the purpose of \"put[ting] pressure on the regime and caus[ing] them problems. So, that may be a feature, not a bug,\" Campbell said.And, to be sure, any risk incurred by using stablecoins under authoritative regimes is surely worth the reward, he noted. \"When the only other option is the government steals all your money, [USDT] is still the better option,\" Campbell said.

    "body": "Courtesy of Disney Enterprises Inc.Blue aliens, a family of superheroes and a city of talking animals boosted the Walt Disney Company to the top of the domestic box office in 2025.Full-year ticket sales in the United States and Canada rose about 4% from 2024 to $9.05 billion. Disney accounted for the highest share of that haul with $2.49 billion in ticket sales, or 27.5%, according to data from Comscore.It's closest competitors were Warner Bros. Discovery, which tallied $1.9 billion domestically, or 21%, and Universal, which took in $1.7 billion, or 19.7%. Together, these three studios accounted for nearly 70% of the domestic box office market share.No other studio surpassed $1 billion in domestic ticket sales or accounted for more than 7% of the total box office haul.\"[Warner Bros., Disney and Universal] have the advantage of having at least two or more distinct and successful sub-brands labels — such as Marvel under Disney, New Line under WB and Illumination under Universal  — under their corporate umbrella that enables these studios to dominate at least in terms of the overall box office and percentage of the marketplace that they control,\" said Paul Dergarabedian, head of marketplace trends at Comscore.Disney's standout performance came on the backs of already popular intellectual property. Four of its films were part of the top 10 highest-grossing domestic releases of the year, including the live-action remake of \"Lilo & Stitch,\" a sequel to 2016's \"Zootopia,\" another entrant in the Marvel Cinematic Universe with \"Fantastic Four: First Steps\" and a third \"Avatar\" film.\"Most years at the box office are dominated by known IP and non-original content; films that have the baked in brand name recognition that theoretically gives those films a leg up in terms of marketing and potential box office success,\" Dergarabedian said.In fact, nine of the 10 biggest movies at the domestic box offices were from existing IP. Warner Bros.' \"Sinners\" was the only original title to make the list.\"In 2025 there were some big budget originals that did incredibly well ... but lest anyone think that trend is going away, 2026 looks to eclipse 2025 in terms of the number of high-profile sequels and known IP on the slate for the year,\" Dergarabedian said. That's especially true for Disney.The studio is set to release its first Star Wars film in theaters since 2019 called \"The Mandalorian and Grogu\" after the popular characters of its \"The Mandalorian\" series on Disney+; \"Toy Story 5\" is will hit theaters in June followed by a live-action \"Moana\" in July; then the hotly anticipated \"Avengers: Doomsday\" arrives in December.A new Spider-Man film will also sling into theaters in 2026, but as part of a deal with Sony to have the character as part of Disney's MCU, Sony keeps the majority of box office profits while Disney gets merchandise sales.The box office will also get a boost from Warner Bros.' \"Supergirl\" and \"Dune: Part Three,\" Universal's \"Minions 3,\" \"The Super Mario Galaxy Movie\" and \"The Odyssey,\" Lionsgate's \"Hunger Games: Sunrise on the Reaping\" and Sony's third \"Jumanji\" film. \"As we look into 2026, there's plenty of optimism to go around,\" said Shawn Robbins, director of analytics at Fandango and founder of Box Office Theory \"The slate is packed with top-tier franchises, some fan-driven and others family-oriented, alongside filmmaker-driven tentpoles ... plus an inevitable crop of strong or potentially surprising performers out of horror, comedy, indie, and other genres.\"Disclosure: Versant is the parent company of CNBC and Fandango.",

Jason Henry | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesFederal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell plans to attend oral arguments on Wednesday at the Supreme Court in a case challenging the power of President Donald Trump to fire Fed Governor Lisa Cook, a person familiar with the situation told CNBC on Monday.Powell's planned attendance comes as the Fed chairman is under criminal investigation by the U.S. Attorney's Office in Washington, D.C., in connection with a multi-billion-dollar renovation of the central bank's headquarters and his testimony to Congress about that project.The Associated Press first reported on Powell's plans.For Powell to personally attend oral arguments in such a case is unusual.But the question of whether a president can fire a Fed governor in the manner that Trump has attempted is viewed within the central bank as having potentially existential consequences.Powell, in an extraordinary public statement on Jan. 11, revealed that he was under criminal investigation, and called its purported grounds a pretext for its real reason: the refusal of the Fed's Board of Governors, which includes him and Cook as members, to lower interest rates as quickly as Trump demanded last year. \"The threat of criminal charges is a consequence of the Federal Reserve setting interest rates based on our best assessment of what will serve the public, rather than following the preferences of the President,\" Powell said.Read more CNBC politics coverageRussia watches as ally Iran edges closer to collapse.

A federal appeals court soon after upheld that order.The Department of Justice, in filings with the Supreme Court, has called the lower court orders barring Cook's removal \"yet another case of improper judicial interference with the President's removal authority — here, interference with the President's authority to  remove members of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors for cause.\"",

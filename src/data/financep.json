Ro Khanna on Friday reintroduced a bill that would curb institutional investors from buying up housing,  leveraging a similar call made recently by President Donald Trump.Trump said in a Truth Social post on Jan. 7 that he would be \"immediately taking steps to ban large institutional investors from buying more single-family homes.\"Trump's remark was one of a flurry of populist economic moves by the president as he races to address voter concerns about affordability ahead of the 2026 midterm elections.A recent Marist poll found that just 36% of Americans approved of Trump's handling of the economy, while 57% disapproved. That is a significant headwind for Trump's fellow Republicans in Congress as they try to hang onto their razor-thin majorities in the House of Representatives and Senate.In a statement to CNBC, Khanna invoked Trump's recent support for blocking institutional investors from buying up housing. \"If President Trump is serious about taking on Wall Street landlords, Congress should pass my bill and he should sign it into law,\" Khanna said. \"Homes should be owned by people, not wealthy corporate landlords who are buying up single-family homes and pushing the dream of homeownership out of reach for too many Americans.\" Read more CNBC politics coverageRussia watches as ally Iran edges closer to collapse.

Kelly sues DOD Sec. Hegseth, says he was punished for 'disfavored political speech'GOP Sen. Thom Tillis vows to block Trump's Fed nominees following Powell probeWhile bill text was not immediately available, Khanna's office told CNBC that the Stop Wall Street Landlords Act would prohibit large institutional investors from taking advantage of home-related tax breaks, including mortgage interest, insurance and depreciation deductions. The bill would also require federal and government-backed agencies such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to prohibit large institutional investors from purchasing mortgages on single-family homes. Large Institutional investors who sell single-family homes more than 18 months after the bill's enactment would be slapped with a real estate transfer tax equal to 100% of the home's sale value. In prior versions of the bill, including one introduced in late 2024, a large institutional investor was defined as a person or firm with assets exceeding $100 million. Khanna has 13 cosponsors on the bill so far, all Democrats. But it's possible that Trump's call for an end to large investors in the single-family home market may prompt some House GOP members to join Khanna's effort.In an interview with CNBC, Khanna said he's willing to work with Trump on legislation \"if it's actually going to help the working class.\" \"If he calls me up, I'll help lead the bill,\" Khanna said. Trump is set to speak at the World Economic Forum in Davos on Wednesday, where the president said he will address his housing proposal. \"I will discuss this topic, including further Housing and Affordability proposals, and more, at my speech in Davos,\" Trump said on Truth Social.",

Clary | Afp | Getty ImagesThe Trump administration wants nations to pay $1 billion to remain on the Board of Peace, Bloomberg first reported on Saturday night, citing a draft charter for the proposed group. The Board of Peace is an international body that was endorsed by the United Nations Security Council in November 2025. The board was established to oversee the Israel-Hamas ceasefire. U.S. President Donald Trump is expected to serve as the group's inaugural chairman, and he will choose which members to invite, according to the draft seen by Bloomberg. While a majority vote would make decisions, the chairman would have final approval. Member states would serve a three-year term on the board, but could secure a permanent seat by paying $1 billion cash within the first year of the charter's start, according to the draft.A U.S. official told CNBC there is no cost to join the Board of Peace, but the $1 billion contribution would secure permanent membership. The group's mandate is to \"rebuild all of Gaza,\" and \"virtually every dollar\" raised would be spent on that mandate. The group will operate without \"exorbitant salaries and massive administrative bloat,\" the official said. It's unclear where the funds collected from Board of Peace members would be held.Trump has invited a number of world leaders, including Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney and Argentine President Javier Milei, to join the Board of Peace for Gaza, which will be part of the larger Board of Peace, Bloomberg reported Saturday. Several other nations, including Hungary, India, Jordan, Greece, Cyprus and Pakistan confirmed Board of Peace invitations, AP News reported on Sunday. Turkey, Egypt, Paraguay and Albania had previously been invited. The full list could be announced by the U.S. in the coming days, the Associated Press reported. Under Trump's leadership, the group has also created a founding executive board to \"oversee a defined portfolio critical to Gaza's stabilization and long-term success,\" the White House said in a statement on Friday. Executive board appointees include U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff, Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner, former United Kingdom Prime Minister Tony Blair, Apollo Global Management CEO Marc Rowan, World Bank President Ajay Banga, and U.S. deputy national security advisor Robert Gabriel. ",

    "body": "Bird's-eye view of central Tokyo including Tokyo Tower at sunrise hours.Vladimir Zakharov | Moment | Getty ImagesJapan's 40-year government bond yield hit a record high on Tuesday amid a broad selloff in government bonds, as investors worried that proposed cuts to the food sales tax could worsen the country's fiscal position.The long-dated yield rose more than 5 basis points to 4%, the highest level since the 40-year maturity was introduced.Yields on shorter maturities climbed sharply as well. The 10-year Japan government bond yield rose by over 6 basis points to 2.3%, the highest level since 1999, while yields on the 20-year tenor jumped by around 9 basis points to 3.35%.The selloff came a day after Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi said she plans to dissolve parliament on Friday and call a snap election on Feb. 8, setting the stage for a campaign that is expected to focus heavily on economic policy.\"Ultra‑long JGB yields are being pushed higher not only by the structural supply–demand imbalance but also by a fresh re-pricing of term and risk premium as markets absorb a more expansionary fiscal stance and persistent inflation,\" said Masahiko Loo, senior fixed income strategist at State Street Investment Management. That repricing has revived a familiar market pattern, he added. \"This has revived the classic 'Takaichi trade' dynamic of stronger Nikkei, weaker JGBs and yen,\" Loo told CNBC.It was a repeat of the volatility seen in October last year, when Japanese markets reacted to comments and policy signals from Takaichi that pointed toward looser fiscal policy, which later stabilized, he added.He added that the current move has strong technical and sentiment echoes rather than signaling structural distress.Loo said the yield curve is likely to remain steep through the first half of this year before stabilizing as bond issuance patterns adjust and domestic banks return as buyers.Similarly, analysts at Crédit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank said markets are increasingly pricing in a durable shift toward aggressive fiscal policy under Takaichi. They said that stance, which aims to move away from what Takaichi described as the \"shackles of excessive austerity,\" could translate into larger deficits.",

Contributor | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesRussian President Vladimir Putin has received an invitation to join the U.S.' \"Board of Peace\" for Gaza, the Kremlin said Monday.Kremlin Spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Moscow would study the details of the proposal to join the peace council created by U.S. President Donald Trump late last year. The \"Board of Peace\" is seen as a vehicle for maintaining a fragile ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, and to oversee the reconstruction of Gaza after their protracted conflict.\"President Putin has indeed received an offer through diplomatic channels to join this Board of Peace. We are currently studying all the details of this proposal,\" Peskov told Russian state news agency TASS. \"We hope to contact the U.S. side to clarify all the details,\" he added.Trump has reportedly invited a number of world leaders, including Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney and Argentine President Javier Milei, to join the Board of Peace for Gaza, which will be part of the larger Board of Peace, Bloomberg reported Saturday.Several other nations, including Hungary, India, Jordan, Greece, Cyprus, and Pakistan confirmed Board of Peace invitations, AP News reported on Sunday.However, the Trump administration reportedly wants nations to pay $1 billion to remain on the board in perpetuity, Bloomberg noted, citing a draft charter for the proposed group.If confirmed, Putin's invitation to join the peace council would raise eyebrows given his oversight of an ongoing war against Russia's neighbor Ukraine. Hundreds of thousands of soldiers and civilians are estimated to have died in the war, which is approaching its four-year anniversary in February.CNBC has contacted the White House for confirmation of Putin's invitation.On Saturday, the U.S. also released the names of those who will sit on a \"founding Executive Board\" of the council, with the list including former U.K. Prime Minister Tony Blair, Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, and U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, among several others.Israel is unhappy with how the \"Board of Peace\" is unfolding, with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office releasing a statement on Friday commenting, \"the announcement regarding the composition of the Gaza Executive Board, which is subordinate to the Board of Peace, was not coordinated with Israel and runs contrary to its policy.\"— CNBC'S Kate Dore contributed reporting to this story.",

Jason Henry | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesFederal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell plans to attend oral arguments on Wednesday at the Supreme Court in a case challenging the power of President Donald Trump to fire Fed Governor Lisa Cook, a person familiar with the situation told CNBC on Monday.Powell's planned attendance comes as the Fed chairman is under criminal investigation by the U.S. Attorney's Office in Washington, D.C., in connection with a multi-billion-dollar renovation of the central bank's headquarters and his testimony to Congress about that project.The Associated Press first reported on Powell's plans.For Powell to personally attend oral arguments in such a case is unusual.But the question of whether a president can fire a Fed governor in the manner that Trump has attempted is viewed within the central bank as having potentially existential consequences.Powell, in an extraordinary public statement on Jan. 11, revealed that he was under criminal investigation, and called its purported grounds a pretext for its real reason: the refusal of the Fed's Board of Governors, which includes him and Cook as members, to lower interest rates as quickly as Trump demanded last year. \"The threat of criminal charges is a consequence of the Federal Reserve setting interest rates based on our best assessment of what will serve the public, rather than following the preferences of the President,\" Powell said.Read more CNBC politics coverageRussia watches as ally Iran edges closer to collapse.

    "body": "Sarah Friar, CFO of OpenAI, appears on CNBC's Squawk Box on August 20, 2025. CNBCOpenAI will make 2026 its year of \"practical adoption,\" the artificial intelligence startup's finance chief said in a blog Sunday. \"The priority is closing the gap between what AI now makes possible and how people, companies, and countries are using it day to day,\" OpenAI CFO Sarah Friar wrote. \"The opportunity is large and immediate, especially in health, science, and enterprise, where better intelligence translates directly into better outcomes.\"In the blog, Friar laid out how OpenAI views its strategy for driving monetization of its services, like ChatGPT, while securing the compute necessary to power those products, saying that the AI lab's revenue directly tracks with the availability of its technical infrastructure. OpenAI's compute grew from 0.2 gigawatts in 2023 to about 1.9 GW in 2025, while the company's annual revenue run rate grew similarly from $2 billion in 2023 to more than $20 billion last year, Friar said. \"This is never-before-seen growth at such scale,\" she wrote. \"And we firmly believe that more compute in these periods would have led to faster customer adoption and monetization.\"Friar's blog comes as OpenAI and the tech industry's focus on AI comes under scrutiny for the massive investments necessary to build out the data centers and secure the energy and components required to power this cutting-edge technology that has yet to deliver much revenue returns for investors. Among those key deals is an agreement between OpenAI and AI chipmaker Nvidia announced in September. Under that agreement, Nvidia said it would commit $100 billion to support the AI startup as it builds and deploys at least 10 GW of Nvidia's systems.A gigawatt is a measure of power, and 10 GW is roughly equivalent to the annual power consumption of 8 million U.S. households, according to a CNBC analysis of data from the Energy Information Administration.But in November, Nvidia told investors there was \"no assurance\" that its agreement with OpenAI would progress beyond an announcement and to an official contract stage. \"Securing world-class compute requires commitments made years in advance, and growth does not move in a perfectly smooth line,\" wrote Friar, adding that the system requires discipline. Three years ago, OpenAI relied on a single compute provider, but now it works with a diversified ecosystem, Friar said. \"We can plan, finance, and deploy capacity with confidence in a market where access to compute defines who can scale,\" she wrote. OpenAI's business model should scale with its services, Friar said. \"As intelligence moves into scientific research, drug discovery, energy systems, and financial modeling, new economic models will emerge,\" she wrote. The blog comes after OpenAI last week said that it planned to begin testing ads for some ChatGPT users in the U.S. That move comes as OpenAI gears up for a potential public debut this year. \"Monetization should feel native to the experience,\" Friar wrote. \"If it does not add value, it does not belong.\"WATCH: OpenAI Investor Letter: Weekly and daily active user figures 'continue to produce all-time highs'watch now",

Etienne Laurent | AFP | Getty ImagesDETROIT — Five years after the transatlantic automaker Stellantis was formed through a merger, the business hasn't necessarily panned out as investors hoped.U.S. shares of the company — created through a $52 billion combination of Italian American automaker Fiat Chrysler and France-based Groupe PSA on Jan. 16, 2021 — are down roughly 43% in the past five years. Italian-listed shares also are off roughly 40%.Since the combined company's stock debuted on the New York Stock Exchange on Jan. 19, 2021, days after the merger was completed, shares of the automaker were largely in the black — up as high as 74% in March 2024 — until Stellantis reported troubling financial results that year amid cost-cutting efforts meant to support higher profits and its multibillion-dollar push into electric vehicles.Many of those plans are being altered or eliminated under new Stellantis CEO Antonio Filosa, who succeeded Carlos Tavares last summer. Tavares, a longtime automotive executive, was largely credited with forming the company, but abruptly left Stellantis in December 2024.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconStellantis shares listed in the U.S. and Italy.Filosa is executing a sales turnaround plan for the automaker and is particularly focused on its Jeep and Ram brands regaining U.S. market share following yearslong sales declines.\"The strategy that we have in front of us is a strong one and will lead us to growth if we execute well,\" he told reporters Wednesday during the Detroit Auto Show. \"So, I believe it's a year of execution.\"Filosa did not rule out the possibility of regionally refocusing or shrinking the company's vast portfolio of brands that also includes Italian nameplates Fiat and Alfa Romeo, which have not performed well domestically.He said he believes the company should \"stay together\" following some speculation, including from Tavares, that it would be better to sell off assets or brands.Filosa said the next step in the company's plans will come during a meeting this month with more than 200 company executives that will focus on an upcoming capital markets day as well as company culture and 2026 execution.PSA CEO Carlos Tavares and FCA CEO Mike Manley shake hands after signing a combination agreement that will lead to the creation of the world's fourth-largest global automaker in terms of annual sales (8.7 million vehicles).FCAInvestors have been eager to hear a new strategy for Stellantis after Tavares' exit. He left amid troubling sales and financial results as the company strived to achieve 10% or greater profit margins and doubling net revenues under his \"Dare Forward 2030\" business plan.U.S. shares of Stellantis since Filosa began as CEO on June 23 are up 2%. They closed Friday at $9.60 per share, down 4.2%. Filosa this week declined to discuss the company's past mistakes, but company executives previously told CNBC that Tavares' fixation on cost reductions and profits hurt business, as well as the company's products, employees and relationships with suppliers, unions and dealers.Filosa has spent much of his time attempting to repair those bonds, especially with the company's distraught U.S. franchised retailers. He's also approved drastic changes to the company's product plans, including reducing prices and reprioritizing products away from electrified vehicles.\"In the six months, I see the changes that we will make we need to make to create the bright future that we need,\" he said regarding his tenure thus far as CEO.

(Photo by Zhu Dayong/VCG via Getty Images)Zhu Dayong | Visual China Group | Getty ImagesChina's birthrate fell to a record low last year, underscoring a deepening demographic crisis as Beijing struggles to reverse a shrinking and aging population. Births dropped to 5.6 per 1,000 people in 2025, down from 6.4 in 2023, marking the lowest level on record, according to data compiled by Wind Information going back to the 1950s.About 7.9 million babies were born last year, sharply fewer than 9.5 million a year before, data from the statistics bureau showed Monday, despite Beijing's efforts to encourage larger families through widening subsidies and expanded parental leave. Even though the country began easing its stringent one-child policy nearly a decade ago, the birth rate continued to plummet — except for a brief spike in 2024, when it climbed to 6.77 per 1,000 people. The increase was widely attributed to the Year of the Dragon, which is traditionally considered an auspicious time to have children. \"The pace of the decline is striking, particularly in the absence of  major shocks,\" said Yue Su, principal economist at Economist Intelligence Unit.She added that the boost from fertility stimulus measures has faded, while young people are delaying marriage and child-bearing plans due to growing economic pressures and intensifying competition in workplaces.Policymakers have rolled out various incentives, including cash rewards and tax breaks for households with children under age 3. Beijing has also extended the maternity leave to 158 days, from 98 days in 2024. China has faced a looming population crisis as its elderly population grew. The share of the population aged 60 and above rose to 23% in 2025, up from 22% in 2024.  The population fell for a fourth year, declining by 3.4 million to 1.405 billion last year, according to the statistics bureau.Economists warned that a shrinking workforce and an ageing population pose major economic risks. Fewer babies mean a shrinking workforce in the future to support a rapidly growing cohort of retirees, piling pressure on the already-stretched pension system. It could also force higher social security contributions, squeezing disposable income for younger workers.  \"A shrinking population implies a smaller consumer base in the future, increasing the risk of wider supply-demand imbalances,\" Su noted, calling for a more forceful policy response on fertility.  World Bank data showed that the fertility rate, defined as births per woman, fell to 1 in China in 2023, the most recent year available, below the global average level of 2.2.  watch now",

    "body": "The logo of the German car manufacturer Volkswagen can be seen on a vehicle in front of a VW dealership.Picture Alliance | Picture Alliance | Getty ImagesShares of some of Europe's biggest carmakers fell sharply on Monday morning, following U.S. President Donald Trump's pledge to impose tariffs on several European countries over Greenland.Europe's Stoxx Automobiles and Parts index traded 2% lower at around 1:02 p.m. London time (8:02 a.m. ET), paring losses from earlier in the session.Germany's Volkswagen, BMW, and Mercedes-Benz Group stood between 2.5% to 3% lower, while Milan-listed shares of Ferrari dipped around 2.2%, notching a 52-week low. Germany's Porsche fell 3.2% on the news.Milan-listed shares of Stellantis, which owns household names including Jeep, Dodge, Fiat, Chrysler, and Peugeot, were last seen 1.8% lower. The moves come shortly after Trump on Saturday pledged to impose 10% tariffs on the U.K., Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, the Netherlands, and Finland by Feb. 1, ramping up his push to make Greenland, a self-governing Danish territory, part of the United States.The levy on these countries will rise to 25% from June 1, Trump said.European political leaders are expected to hold emergency talks over the coming days as they consider their response. The automotive sector is widely regarded as acutely vulnerable to levies, particularly given the high globalization of supply chains and the heavy reliance on manufacturing operations across North America. watch now\"Our view is that ultimately tariffs are a blunt tool that seldom really works for any sort of length of time. Mostly because it's a very global economy these days and people find a way around it even if they can't talk themselves out of them,\" Rob Brewis, director and investment manager at Aubrey Capital Management, told CNBC's \"Europe Early Edition\" on Monday.\"Clearly, the tariffs created a huge stir back in April last year but ever since then, their impact diminishes with time and with repeated use, I guess,\" he added.Asked which European sectors were likely most exposed to Trump's latest tariff threats, Brewis singled out the automotive industry.\"My focus is more on emerging markets, so I spend less time on Europe, but I think it's unhelpful for sectors like the car sector, which is already facing huge threats from the Chinese players,\" he added.",

    "body": "Scott Bessent, US treasury secretary, during an Economic Club of Minnesota event in Golden Valley, Minnesota, US, on Thursday, Jan. 8, 2026. Ben Brewer | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Sunday said it's \"very unlikely\" that the Supreme Court will overturn President Donald Trump's use of emergency powers to impose tariffs, with a potential decision from the court looming as early as this week. \"I believe that it is very unlikely that the Supreme Court will overrule a president's signature economic policy,\" Bessent said on NBC's \"Meet the Press.\" \"They did not overrule Obamacare, I believe that the Supreme Court does not want to create chaos.\" In June, the Supreme Court upheld a key Affordable Care Act provision that set up a panel to recommend preventive care services that insurers must provide at no cost to patients.Bessent's comments come one day after Trump said he would impose a new slate of tariffs on goods coming from Europe until \"a Deal is reached for the Complete and Total purchase of Greenland.\" Trump did not specify in his Truth Social post which statute he was invoking to impose the tariffs, though the move appears to mirror the \"liberation day\" duties he has imposed on dozens of nations under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. The tariffs on goods from Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and Finland will begin at 10% on Feb. 1, Trump said. They will then escalate to 25% on June 1, Trump said. The Supreme Court is set to rule on Trump's use of the IEEPA to impose tariffs before the end of its term, but a decision could come as soon as this week.

Leaders in Greenland, Denmark and across Europe have widely rejected Trump's demands to take over the island. European leaders of countries targeted by the new tariffs responded on Sunday. \"Tariff threats undermine transatlantic relations and risk a dangerous downward spiral. We will continue to stand united and coordinated in our response,\" the leaders of Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden and the United Kingdom said in a joint statement.\"We stand in full solidarity with the Kingdom of Denmark and the people of Greenland. Building on the process begun last week, we stand ready to engage in a dialogue based on the principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity that we stand firmly behind,\" the statement read.Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio met with Danish Foreign Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen and Greenland's Minister of Foreign Affairs Vivian Motzfeldt at the White House last week in a meeting that Rasmussen described as \"frank but constructive.\"After the meeting, the group said the U.S. and Denmark would establish a high-level working group to chart Greenland's future.The Trump administration claims that a U.S. acquisition of Greenland is critical to national security to counter the expansion of Russia and China in the region.

    "body": "A protester takes part in a demonstration to show support for Greenland in Copenhagen, Denmark, on Jan. 17, 2026.Tom Little | ReutersEuropean states are reportedly considering retaliatory tariffs and broader punitive economic counter-measures against the U.S. after President Donald Trump threatened fresh export levies, deepening a rift over Greenland.Trump announced Saturday that eight European countries would face increasing tariffs, starting at 10% on Feb. 1 and rising to 25% on June 1, if a deal is not reached allowing Washington to acquire Greenland, the mineral-rich island which is a semi-autonomous territory of Denmark.The proposed tariffs would target Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, the U.K, the Netherlands and Finland. The duties would come on top of existing export tariffs to the U.S., currently standing at 10% for the U.K. and 15% for the EU. Regional diplomats held an emergency meeting in Brussels on Sunday afternoon to discuss their response to Trump's threat to escalate tariffs, with France reportedly pushing for the EU to use its strongest economic counter-threat to the U.S., known as the \"Anti-Coercion Instrument\" (ACI).Protesters wave Greenland flags during a demonstration under the slogans 'hands off Greenland' and 'Greenland for Greenlanders' in front of the US embassy in Copenhagen, Denmark, on January 17, 2026. Nurphoto | Nurphoto | Getty ImagesThe much-vaunted instrument is seen as a nuclear option when it comes to economic counter-measures as it could see the EU restrict U.S. suppliers' access to the EU market, excluding them from participation in public tenders in the bloc, as well as putting export and import restrictions on goods and services and putting potential limits on foreign direct investment in the region.Despite being seen as a \"big bazooka\" against Trump's tariffs playbook, it has not been used before, and regional leaders have already said they want to pursue dialogue with the U.S. in the coming days to resolve the rift over Greenland.The Financial Times reported that the EU was contemplating imposing 93 billion euros ($108 billion) worth of tariffs, as well as considering the use of the ACI. Meanwhile, Reuters reported that the European Parliament will likely now suspend its work on the EU-U.S. trade deal struck last July. The assembly had been due to vote on removing many EU import duties on U.S. goods on Jan. 26-27, but that approval could now be delayed, Reuters reported.Read moreFrench Finance Minister Roland Lescure said Monday that the EU \"must be prepared\" to use its anti-coercion mechanism, in comments translated by Reuters.While France is more gung-ho about the ACI, Germany is among the countries that have tended to shy away from using it before.\"The key question to watch is whether the EU will try to keep the confrontation confined to such a more \"classic\" trade war, or whether calls for a harsher line prevail,\" Carsten Nickel, deputy director of Research at Teneo, said in emailed comments. \"Representing the latter camp, France has called on its partners to formally invoke the EU's so-called anti-coercion instrument ... [but] other EU member states, including Germany, will likely remain careful.\" The reasons for this divide are multifaceted, Nickel noted, including factors such as France traditionally advocating for a more independent European role in continental security, and it being less export-dependent than other nations like Germany.Months of wrangling ahead?European leaders were quick to react to Trump's surprise tariff threat, with U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer commenting Saturday that \"applying tariffs on allies for pursuing the collective security of NATO allies is completely wrong,\" while French President Emmanuel Macron described them as \"unacceptable.\"Nonetheless, leaders are expected to use the World Economic Forum taking place in Davos, Switzerland, this week, as an opportunity to try to talk to Trump, who is addressing the forum on Wednesday.watch nowEconomists warn that, much like last year when months of wrangling took place before a trade deal was signed between the U.S. and EU, this spring will likely be dominated by similarly thorny discussions over Greenland.\"My base case is that the Feb. 1 [tariffs] deadline is going to be postponed as diplomatic measures are implemented,\" Mohit Kumar, chief European economist at Jefferies, told CNBC Monday.President Donald Trump attends a bilateral meeting with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen during the 50th World Economic Forum (WEF) annual meeting in Davos, Switzerland, January 21, 2020. Jonathan Ernst | Reuters\"That said, I think this is different from the usual TACO [Trump Always Chickens Out] trade. For Greenland, the position for Europe is very clear: it's not for sale, and they will not tolerate aggression ... But what Trump has shown is that he wants Greenland. I don't see how the issue is going to go away that soon. So we are looking at months, or potentially quarters, of uncertainty over tariffs.\"\"For Europe it's a negative. Growth will be reduced,\" he warned, ahead of what could be a frantic market day for European bourses on Monday, with regional indexes looking set to slump at the open.",

    "body": "An aerial view of the town ahead of World Economic Forum (WEF), also known as Davos Summit in Davos, Switzerland on January 14, 2024.Anadolu | Anadolu | Getty ImagesJ.P. Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang are among the who's who of political leaders, big-name CEOs and tech pioneers heading to Davos, Switzerland for the World Economic Forum's annual meeting.U.S. President Donald Trump is also attending in person for the first time since he addressed the forum during his first term in 2020. His virtual address last year, days after reentering the White House, shook the event. This time, he will bring the \"largest\" U.S. delegation yet, according to WEF.Davos organizers are keen to talk up the numbers they expect to attend — \"close to 3,000 cross-sector leaders,\" plus a \"record\" 400 political leaders, 850 top company bosses and 100 tech pioneers. But a government at the center of a geopolitical firestorm won't be there.Danish government representatives were invited and decided not to attend, a WEF spokesperson said on Monday, as the dispute over Greenland intensified. Their decision underscores how tense the meeting is likely to be, coming just days after Trump announced fresh tariffs on European countries resisting his attempt to annex the Arctic island. \"Any decisions on attendance are a matter for the government concerned. We can confirm that the Danish government will not be represented in Davos this week,\" the WEF spokesperson said in a statement.There are big names among those who aren't going.Chinese President Xi Jinping is not on WEF's attendance list, neither are the leaders of Brazil and India. U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer and Italy's leader Giorgia Meloni are not on the WEF list, although both are reported to be attending.Big economic powersDuring a press conference last week, WEF organizers highlighted that six of the G7 nations are expected to send representatives, in a \"historic\" move, according to WEF's president, Børge Brende. In 2025, the only G7 leader attending Davos in person was then-German Chancellor Olaf Scholz.Alongside President Trump, French President Emmanuel Macron, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, and German Chancellor Friedrich Merz are set to attend in person.

In an emergency press conference on Monday morning, Starmer addressed Trump's announcement of escalating tariffs targeting several European countries, including the U.K., if Greenland isn't sold to the U.S. But when asked by the BBC whether he would consider meeting Trump in person \"this week,\" Starmer did not directly answer the question.U.K. Finance Minister Rachel Reeves is set to attend and be a guest on CNBC's \"Squawk Box Europe\" on Wednesday.Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi isn't mentioned on WEF's list, but she is likely to remain in her country, given that she announced on Monday a snap election for Feb. 8.'More of the CEOs'Davos runs from Monday evening to Friday morning. This year's theme is \"A spirit of dialogue,\" with an agenda focusing on five areas: the geopolitical environment, AI, climate and nature, new sources of economic growth and \"people and preparedness.\"But the interest will be in who will attend Davos, according to Eric Kutcher, a senior partner at McKinsey & Company, a \"strategic partner\" to WEF. \"It's going to be about who is there,\" he said in a video published by the company. \"Much more so than what you see in the topics,\" Kutcher said.Trump's delegation is set to include U.S Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, plus Middle East special envoy Steve Witkoff and adviser Jared Kushner. The president is scheduled to address Davos on Wednesday.U.S. President Donald Trump on screen during his address by video conference at the World Economic Forum annual meeting in Davos on Jan. 23, 2025. Fabrice Coffrini | Afp | Getty ImagesWEF's founder, Klaus Schwab, is one big name who won't be at Davos. After running the event for decades, Schwab stepped down in April following an investigation into alleged misconduct. He was subsequently cleared of \"material wrongdoing.\"BlackRock CEO Larry Fink and Roche vice-chair Andre Hoffman were announced as WEF's interim co-chairs in August, and the organization's new personnel are \"making a real push to kind of re-instil the economic orientation of WEF, and in doing so, bringing more of the CEOs,\" Kutcher said. Alongside Nvidia's Huang, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei and DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis are on WEF's attendance list. Sarah Friar, OpenAI's chief financial officer, is also set to participate, but the company's CEO, Sam Altman, is not down to attend.Key topics for markets include U.S. moves towards a Greenland takeover, political turmoil in Venezuela and the threat by Trump to use force against Iran. Investors will also be watching for announcements from AI firms, central bank updates, and news about companies diversifying away from the U.S.While some big-name politicians aren't attending, some of the leaders who are going — such as Argentina's Javier Milei and Indonesia's Prabowo Subianto — are \"no small figures,\" according to Jan Aart Scholte, professor of global transformations and governance challenges at Leiden University in the Netherlands.Argentina's President Javier Milei delivers a speech at the World Economic Forum (WEF) meeting in Davos on January 17, 2024. (Photo by Fabrice COFFRINI / AFP) (Photo by FABRICE COFFRINI/AFP via Getty Images)Fabrice Coffrini | Afp | Getty ImagesGovernments still see Davos as a place to meet with businesses, he added. \"Global capital remains a strong force in world politics, even if big multinational enterprises are generally less embraced and celebrated than 20-30 years ago,\" he told CNBC in an email Monday.Who's not on the listWhile WEF said there are \"close to\" 65 heads of state expected to attend, plus key figures such as European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, other big names are not on the list.Brazil's President Lula da Silva and India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi are not scheduled to give addresses. But Brende described India's delegation as \"strong,\" and noted that the heads of state of other Asian economies, including Indonesia and Pakistan, would attend.While China's President Xi is not expected to attend, Brende said a \"big\" Chinese delegation would attend, including trade and finance Vice Premier He Lifeng, who is due to address the event on Tuesday.Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the de facto ruler of his nation, is not on WEF's attendance list. But several of the country's ministers, including Finance Minister Mohammed Al Jadaan, are scheduled to be interviewed by CNBC during the event.Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said on Monday he would no longer attend after two high-speed trains collided in the south of the country on Sunday, killing 39 people.A former Davos critic makes an appearanceNigel Farage, leader of the right-wing Reform UK, is expected to attend the event this year. Farage previously called Davos \"elite\" and said those attending were \"people deciding our futures in Swiss ski resorts\" in a 2020 video. Indeed, Davos has been seen by some as elitist and out-of-touch, Scholte said. \"Nationalist-populist circles commonly view the WEF as a beacon of a liberal globalist elite that draws their ire,\" he told CNBC via email.- CNBC's Leonie Kidd contributed to this report.",

    "body": "Jamie Dimon, Chairman and CEO, JPMorganChase, speaks during the Reagan National Defense Forum at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley, California, U.S. December 6, 2025.  Jonathan Alcorn | ReutersPresident Donald Trump on Saturday threatened to sue JPMorgan Chase over allegedly \"debanking\" him following the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol. \"I'll be suing JPMorgan Chase over the next two weeks for incorrectly and inappropriately DEBANKING me after the January 6th Protest, a protest that turned out to be correct for those doing the protesting,\" Trump said in a social media post. \"The Election was RIGGED!\"\"While we won't get specific about a client, we don't close accounts because of political beliefs,\" said JPMorgan spokesperson Trish Wexler. \"We appreciate that this Administration has moved to address political debanking and we support those efforts.\"In August, Trump signed an executive order requiring banks to ensure they are not refusing financial services to clients based on religious or political beliefs, a practice known as \"debanking.\" Trump claimed without evidence in an August CNBC interview that he was personally discriminated against by banks. He said JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America refused to take his deposits following his first term in office. At the time, JPMorgan said it does not close accounts for political reasons, while Bank of America said it doesn't comment on client matters. BofA also said it would welcome clearer rules from regulators on how to conduct its activities.Trump and his family have a history of railing against financial institutions for allegedly refusing to work with them on the basis of their political orientation. Last year, Donald Trump Jr. said his family had difficulty accessing big bank services — a situation that allegedly prompted the Trumps to enter the cryptocurrency industry. \"So, [my family] got into crypto, not because it was like, 'hey, this is the next cool thing,' we got into it out of necessity,\" Trump Jr. told CNBC in an interview last June.JPMorgan shares are down about 5% over the past week, even after the bank on Tuesday topped expectations for its fourth-quarter earnings and revenue. The shares, and others in the banking sector, fell in response to Trump's demand to cap credit card rates at 10%, giving financial firms until Jan. 20 to comply.Trump's legal threat against JPMorgan comes as the president, in the same Truth Social post, denied a Journal report on Wednesday that said the president had offered JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon the position of Federal Reserve chairman months ago during a meeting at the White House. Dimon took the proposition as a joke, according to the Journal report.In his post, Trump denied the report, underscoring his reservations about Dimon and JPMorgan. \"This statement is totally untrue, there was never such an offer,\" he wrote. \"Why wouldn't The Wall Street Journal call me to ask whether or not such an offer was made? I would have very quickly told them, \"NO,\" and that would have been the end of the story.\"JPMorgan's Wexler said the \"offer\" reported by the Journal was a miscommunication. \"I should have been more vigilant in correcting that word while attempting to dispute the WSJ's anonymous sources,\" she said.The Journal did not immediately respond to a request for comment sent outside of normal business hours. Current Fed Chairman Jerome Powell's term ends on May 15.",

    "body": "Gold and silver surged to fresh highs just days after breaking previous records, as investors flock to safe-haven assets amid a choppy geopolitical and economic ‍outlook.U.S. gold futures for February delivery rose 1.71% to $4,674.20 per ounce on Monday, after earlier hitting a record high last week. Spot gold was 1.6% higher at $4,668.14.It comes after U.S. President Donald Trump announced tariffs on goods from eight European countries until a deal for \"the Complete and Total purchase of Greenland,\" as he ramps up his rhetoric on annexing the Arctic island.\"Gold's rally has been powerful, but it has also been grounded in fundamentals that are still very much in place. With real rates likely to fall and central banks continuing to diversify their reserves, we see more reason for gold to consolidate or edge higher than to sell off sharply,\" George Cheveley, natural resources portfolio manager at Ninety One, said in the asset manager's 2026 sectoral outlook, published on Monday.At current prices, margins are expected to be four to five times higher than in 2024, per the outlook. Silver followed gold's upward swing and looks comfortable at such prices. U.S. silver futures for March advanced to a record $93.035 per ounce and were last seen 5.06% higher at $93.02. Silver's spot price was 3.55% higher at $93.16 per ounce.watch nowGold and silver tend to perform well in periods of heightened uncertainty as riskier assets, such as equities, fall out of favor.The tariffs over Greenland follow the U.S. capturing the Venezuelan president on Jan. 3 and taking control of the country's oil industry; and Trump suggesting a military strike against Iran was imminent amid that country's clampdown on civil unrest, only to appear to back down from the threat last week.European and Asia-Pacific markets mostly slipped on Monday as investors assessed geopolitical threats. Shares of some of Europe's biggest carmakers and key luxury goods names fell on Monday morning as investors digest possible tariffs on European countries. Trump said these would be 10% from Feb. 1., rising to 25% from June 1 if no deal is done. The Stoxx Europe 600 Automobiles & Parts Index was 2.2% lower in early dealmaking, while the Stoxx Europe Luxury 10 index 2.9% lower.European countries are reportedly considering retaliatory tariffs and broader economic counter-measures. Read moreThe Justice Department's criminal investigation of Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell may also be rattling markets as investors weigh up the long-term impact of Trump's war of words aimed at pressuring it to lower interest rates.Meanwhile, conflict in Ukraine persists and progress in Gaza is expected to take years.Other base metals also gained but were driven by megatrends rather than geopolitics. Copper in particular has an \"attractive\" risk-reward profile thanks to demand from energy and data center infrastructure, per Cheveley.U.S. copper futures for March were last seen 0.54% higher at $5.8625 per ounce, paring gains from a Jan. 6. peak.

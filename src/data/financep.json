    "body": "OpenAI's EMEA startups head Laura Modiano spoke at the Sifted Summit on Wednesday, 8 October.Nurphoto | Nurphoto | Getty ImagesIn the latest comparison between American and European founders, OpenAI's startup boss admitted that the Americans are \"almost shameless\" when it comes to making demands and giving feedback to the AI giant.Laura Modiano, who heads up OpenAI's startups division in EMEA, drew a comparison between American and European founders based on her extensive work with founders across both regions and rolling out AI features.\"So feedback is extremely important. We're moving at lightning speed. It has to represent your voice and I see American founders being extremely good, almost shameless, and coming in and saying: 'We need this. You need to get better at that. You need to improve that. You need this new feature,'\" Modiano said during a fireside chat at the Sifted Summit on Wednesday. \"If founders don't tell us, we don't always know.\"She called on European founders to be much more vocal — or risk missing out on big opportunities.\"Please, please, please, if you're using OpenAI ... you should always tell us what you think about it, what is working, what isn't and how we can do better.\"She cited Lovable, valued at $1.8 billion, as an example of a European company good at giving feedback. The Swedish vibe coding startup has a GPT-5-based assistant called Lovable Assistant 5.\"When GPT-5 was launched, they [Lovable] were one of the companies that launched with us, and they were in the alpha, so early access to GPT-5, and they gave us a lot of feedback. Like, I was in their office for a week, and literally every hour, we were having reviews,\" she said.\"'How is something working? What do we need?' So GPT-5 launching actually had the taste of European developers included in the model that all of you are using today. So unless you're vocal about it, you're missing out on a great opportunity.\"Swedish AI-learning platform Sana was another startup praised by Modiano.\"I was in their office a few months ago and they said: 'We really need this capability on voice, the tone of voice, the speed, this is what we need.' I got that feedback then we see who else has had similar feedback, and then we prioritize that feature on the roadmap to make sure that we're servicing what the customer is asking for,\" she said.\"I give this advice often. I say every startup, especially every AI startup, should have a chief feedback officer, because we can only ship and include things in our roadmap, different features, different improvements, if we know what customers want,\" she added.European vs. U.S. startupsWith her comments, Modiano was fanning the flames of a debate that has seen European entrepreneurs criticized for lacking the same intensity and vigor as their American counterparts.Earlier this year, some venture capitalists suggested that startup founders in Europe needed to increase their work hours — including working seven days a week — to be more competitive globally.Harry Stebbings, founder of 20VC, previously told CNBC Make It that Europeans are not as good at marketing themselves when pitching their company to venture capitalists and are often held back by a culture of reservedness.By contrast, Americans are much better at telling exciting stories to promote their businesses: \"I think, often in the U.K., we downsize in ambitions,\" he said.More recently, U.K. Business Secretary Peter Kyle fired shots at British university students, criticizing them for lacking ambition and not having the drive to start their own companies, as opposed to students at American universities.\"In Britain, if you went to a group of undergraduates, how big would that group have to be before you found someone that said their choice of going to university … was because they wanted to become a founder?\" Kyle said at an event hosted by AI chipmaker Nvidia in London. \"The entrepreneurialism simply isn't there – the drive, the vigour.\"",

    "body": "Last year, while researching for my book \"Healthy to 100: How Strong Social Ties Lead to Long Lives,\" I visited five of the world's healthiest countries — Singapore, Japan, South Korea, Italy, and Spain — to see how they keep older adults active, engaged, purposeful, and healthy.I picked these countries because they have some of the longest healthy life expectancies in the world (in some cases, a decade longer than the U.S.). And none of them the most ideal environments for aging: Singapore is hot, crowded, and has a notoriously competitive work environment, for instance. In Spain, obesity and smoking rates are significant. If these countries can succeed, so can we.At a community development center in Kanazawa, Japan, older adults teach, volunteer, run the restaurant, or just hang out with young people and those with Down syndrome. In Korea, lifelong learning is written into the Constitution. Singapore is building a whole \"health district.\" Italy taps into the wisdom and energy of seniors through volunteering.After seeing how these countries are rewriting the rules on aging, I'm doing five things to live a longer, happier life.1. I'll plan for the next 20 years, like I did the last 20In other countries, definitions of \"old age\" are fluid, tied to individual circumstances rather than arbitrary dates. At 62, I can easily have another 20 or more years of good health, and unlike many older adults, I am going to plan them with the same seriousness of purpose I did the last 20.   I spent the first big chunk of my career managing people who create content. It was only in my 50s that I realized I was much happier telling the stories myself. In the last decade, I've written three books, hosted my own podcast, launched two weekly newsletters, and started a video channel on Instagram called GrandPeople. While our society often pushes us to make big, intentional career and life plans in our 20s, 30s, 40s, and 50s, we don't typically expect as much from people over the age of 60. But as I look ahead, I'm excited to continue honing and developing my craft. Because there's no reason the next 20 years can't be as meaningful and purposeful as the last. 2. I won't retire anytime soon, but I will rethink how I workJapan has the highest percentage of older workers in the world, and many of them aren't working just for the money. They do it for purpose, connection, and health. Most work part-time, on flexible schedules, or in job shares.While in Japan, I met older adults working on candy assembly lines, managing books for a machine tool company, running parking lots, driving taxis, and guiding tours.The lesson they embodied stuck with me. As I think about my own future, I plan to continue working, but on my terms. I'll keep writing books and telling stories. But maybe I won't commit to putting out two newsletters a week forever. And that's okay. Instead of working full-steam or retiring completely, I can find a middle ground. The goal is to keep working in a way that fits the life I want to lead.3. I'll spend time with people of all agesAmericans don't tend to think of intergenerational connection as a public health strategy, but people in the countries I visited see how important this is. Studies all over the world have shown the benefits of intergenerational relationships, such as increased happiness, a better sense of well-being, and improved physical and mental health.Even in the U.S., which has been described as one of the most age-segregated societies in the world, there are opportunities for intergenerational collaboration: at work, in neighborhoods, in volunteer settings, in families. I'll proactively find places and activities that connect me with younger generations, and choose to foster my friendships with people of all ages. Down the line, I'd consider moving into a place like Mirabella at Arizona State University or Gorham House in Maine, which combines a nursing home with a preschool. 4. I'll prioritize socializing over scrollingTime spent with friends has dropped precipitously in the U.S., while time spent with technology has skyrocketed. It doesn't have to be that way. I saw for myself how Italians spend more time at meals and with family and less time online. This couldn't be more important. A decades-long Harvard study tells us that positive relationships are key to living a longer, happier, healthier life — more crucial even than career achievement, money, exercise, or a healthy diet.My baby steps include being more intentional about family meals without phones and trying to cut back on the obsessive scrolling of the news and Instagram that interferes with human conversation.  5. I'll never stop learningResearch has demonstrated that learning supports healthy aging. Many states provide free or low-cost education opportunities to older adults, and I plan to take advantage of them. As I think ahead to my next book project, I might enroll in a writing seminar at an Osher Lifelong Learning Institute designed to serve older learners. Each one is associated with a university — the closest to me is at American University — and offers a wide range of classes. Whatever class I take or learning I do, it will be in person. Because interacting face-to-face maximizes social connection and healthy longevity. Ken Stern is a nationally recognized expert on longevity and aging. He is the founder of the Longevity Project and hosts the popular \"Century Lives\" podcast from the Stanford Center on Longevity. His most recent book is Healthy to 100: How Strong Social Ties Lead to Long Lives.\" He is also the former CEO of NPR.Want to be your own boss? Sign up for Smarter by CNBC Make It's new online course, How To Start A Business: For First-Time Founders.

    "body": "A Spirit Airlines flight arrives at Arnold Palmer Regional Airport in Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania, U.S., September 18, 2025.  Quinn Glabicki | ReutersSpirit Airlines won approval for a $475 million lifeline and a $150 million payment from its biggest aircraft lessor in court on Friday, as the struggling budget airline races to stabilize itself after its second bankruptcy since November. U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York approved the $475 million in debtor-in-possession financing, a lifeline that bankrupt companies can use to continue operating, along with $150 million from AerCap and the rejection of 27 airplane leases. Spirit said on Friday that $200 million would be immediately available for the carrier.Spirit has been cutting dozens of routes, announced plans to slash its fleet, and last month said it would furlough about one third of its flight attendants to cut costs. The airline is in talks with its pilots' union and is seeking about $100 million in cuts from that group.\"We are pleased to have reached another significant milestone in our restructuring, which represents continued progress toward securing a successful future for Spirit,\" Spirit CEO Dave Davis said in a news release Friday.Spirit's problems piled up in recent years: An engine recall, a failed acquisition by JetBlue, a jump in labor and other costs, and a shift in consumer tastes for more upmarket offerings. Spirit has spent more than a year trying to offer travelers roomier seats and other fare packages beyond the cheap tickets and a la carte add-ons like seat selection and cabin baggage that it's been known for for years.Read more CNBC airline newsAir traffic control shortages add to U.S. flight delays, FAA saysSpirit Airlines on track for a $475 million bankruptcy lifeline'Seconds count': Avoiding airplane collisions at airports could come down to cockpit alertsU.S. startup airline Breeze Airways plans first international flights",

    "body": "Venezuelan opposition leader Maria Corina Machado is leading a demonstration against the re-inauguration of authoritarian President Maduro this Friday.Jesus Vargas | Picture Alliance | Getty ImagesThe White House on Friday complained that President Donald Trump was snubbed for the Nobel Peace Prize because the award's committee placed \"politics over peace.\"But the prize's actual recipient, Venezuelan opposition leader Maria Corina Machado, said she was partly dedicating the award to Trump for supporting her efforts to promote democracy in her country.Machado said in an X post that her cause of achieving freedom and democracy depends on Trump and other key allies.\"I dedicate this prize to the suffering people of Venezuela and to President Trump for his decisive support of our cause!\" she wrote.Machado's shoutout came less than three hours after White House communications director Steven Cheung claimed that by snubbing Trump, \"The Nobel Committee proved they place politics over peace.\"Trump reportedly called Machado on Friday to congratulate her on receiving the Nobel Peace Prize.Trump for years has said he deserves the prize, which has been awarded by the Norwegian Nobel Committee more than 100 times since 1901 to honor one person's work to promote peace.He has also been openly critical of former President Barack Obama receiving the prize in 2009.\"They gave it to Obama for doing absolutely nothing but destroying our country,\" Trump said Thursday.In recent months, Trump has frequently said that he ended seven wars — a claim that has been disputed by fact checkers.After Israel and Hamas agreed to the first phase of a peace plan this week, Trump claimed, \"This would be number eight.\"A number of Trump's Republican allies have advocated for him to get the prize, though the nomination deadline for the 2025 award ended less than two weeks into his current presidential term.Asked about the campaign for Trump, Nobel Committee Chair Jørgen Watne Frydnes said that his panel is used to receiving media attention and \"thousands and thousands of letters\" every year.\"This committee sits in a room filled with the portraits of all laureates and that room is filled with both courage and integrity,\" Frydnes said at a press conference.\"We base only our decision on the work and the will of Alfred Nobel.\"Read more CNBC politics coverageTrump puts extra 100% tariff on China imports, adds export controls on 'critical software'Qatar Air Force facility to be built at USAF base in Idaho, Defense Secretary Hegseth saysTrump nominee Paul Ingrassia reportedly accused of sexual harassmentTrump administration begins layoffs of federal workers amid government shutdownNew York AG James indicted by grand jury after Trump called for chargesTrump threatens 'massive' tariff hike on China over rare earths disputeNobel Peace Prize winner Machado praises Trump after White House criticizes snub'There will start to be layoffs' if Trump decides shutdown talks have stalled, Hassett saysEpstein bank records sought by top House Democrat from Jamie Dimon, other CEOsTreasury weighs minting $1 coin with Trump's face for U.S. 250th anniversaryGovernment shutdown: Senate funding measures fail again as deadlock continues",

    "body": "U.S. President Donald Trump looks on during an announcement about lowering U.S. drug prices, at the White House in Washington, D.C., U.S., Oct. 10, 2025. Kent Nishimura | ReutersOn Friday morning, the S&P 500 was less than a couple of points from another all-time high. Then, after a single social media post from President Donald Trump, $2 trillion in market value was wiped out.The unraveling shows the sway the president's one-man trade policy still has over the fate of the global economy.Trump at 10:57 a.m. ET wrote on his Truth Social platform that China was \"becoming very hostile\" with the rest of the world, especially when it comes to its control of rare earth metals. He accused China of holding the world \"captive\" because of its \"monopoly\" on these crucial resources. The key part that the stock market reacted to in the 500-word Trump post was this: \"One of the policies that we are calculating at this moment is a massive increase of tariffs on Chinese products coming into the United States of America.\"That's all it took.Bespoke Investment Group calculates that about $2 trillion in value from the U.S. stock market was erased by that single post. The S&P 500 lost 2.7% as the closing bell rang out at the New York Stock Exchange. It was its worst performance since early April, when the stock market was in the throes of a cascading sell-off from Trump's so-called liberation day rollout of higher-than-expected duties for every country on the globe.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconS&P 500, 1-dayThe Nasdaq Composite, home to the technology companies that rely on trade with China, sank 3.56%, also its worst performance since April. The Nasdaq touched an all-time high before the Trump post in Friday's session.The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 879 points, or 1.9% for its worst performance since May. The Russell 2000 small-cap benchmark shed 3%.Why such a violent drop?While the Trump administration's trade talks with China have been progressing at a much slower pace than those with other countries, the stock market consensus was that something would eventually be worked out between the two nations and that overall relations were improving. Trump and the Chinese leader Xi Jinping were set to meet at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit at the end of this month.The market had also become comfortable with the around 40% tariff rate already applied to China, reasoning that the U.S. economy was stronger than previously thought to withstand it, and exemptions for products made in China — like Apple's iPhones — were broad enough to soften any economic impact.A trader works at the New York Stock Exchange on Oct. 10, 2025. NYSEIf Trump follows through with his latest threat, investors fear that the load may be too great to bear for the U.S. economy, which is still reliant on imported parts to build automobiles, solar panels, and the like.Perhaps the greater risk that weighs on the market is retaliation from China on U.S. goods that could lead to an all-out trade war.What sparked Trump's threat?China, overnight into Thursday, tightened its grip further on the rare earths market, of which it controls about 70% of the global supply. Beijing said outside entities must obtain licenses to export pretty much anything using its rare earths and that companies using the metals for military applications would be denied. The companies' usage would be reviewed on a case-by-case basis by China.A trader works at the New York Stock Exchange on Oct. 10, 2025. NYSERare earths are crucial for making semiconductors, electric vehicles and materials for advanced missiles. Trump has been trying to bolster the U.S. supplies of the metal by supporting, and even investing in, U.S. and Canada-based companies that mine for the metal.What led Friday's sell-off?Chipmakers such as Nvidia and AMD led the stock market drop Friday. Nvidia, which is still trying to gain support from the two countries to sell a less-advanced AI chip to China, lost 5%. AMD, which had been leading the latest leg of the rally, sank nearly 8%. Apple lost 3%, while Tesla shed 5%.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconNvidia, 1-dayBut it wasn't just shares of companies directly related to China trade that declined. It was a broad market sell-off, with 424 of the S&P 500 members closing in the red. Pro investors were forced to reduce risk in everything due to a sudden drop of this magnitude. With their tech positions getting hit, other holdings needed to be sold to raise cash. Plus, there's the threat the potential new tariffs pose to the U.S. economy. Domestic financials Bank of America and Wells Fargo lost more than 2% each, for example.A few stocks did manage to stay green on the day. Walmart and the tobacco/nicotine stocks were slightly higher because of their defensive properties.How long will this sell-off last?Monday could be another rough day for the markets because Trump followed up his morning post after the closing bell by saying he would impose 100% tariffs on China \"over and above any tariff that they are currently paying.\" Trump added that the U.S. would put export controls on \"any and all critical software,\" which could significantly impact AI leaders like Nvidia. The new duties would begin at the start of next month, around the time of the summit when Trump was set to meet with Xi. Trump's Friday morning post suggested those talks may not happen now.The SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust, a fund that tracks the S&P 500, added a bit to Friday's session losses after the bell.Still, some traders and investors believe it may be wise to wait and see if Trump follows through fully on this threat. Most of the stiff tariffs threatened in early April — which sent global markets reeling — were subsequently pared back significantly through negotiations and exemptions, laying the groundwork for a monster comeback rally to new highs for the market. It paid then to call Trump on his bluff and buy the dip — and many investors think it will again.\"The good news is that this may just be another negotiating tactic used by the administration that could yield good results over the long term,\" said Jay Woods, chief market strategist at Freedom Capital Markets, during the height of the selling pressure at the NYSE. \"The knee-jerk sell-off should be another buying opportunity.\"It's worth having some perspective on Friday's sell-off as well. The drop only took the S&P 500 back to its lowest level in a month. The benchmark is still up more than 11% for the year, with a seemingly unstoppable AI trade overshadowing any threat from tariffs, global conflicts and an ongoing government shutdown.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconS&P 500, YTDThe move disrupted an unusually placid period for the stock market, jarring complacent investors into running for cover for the first time in a long while and adding to the pain. Thursday was the 33rd straight day without a 1% S&P 500 move in either direction, the longest calm streak since January 2020. The market hasn't had a major decline since the April tariff rollout correction.One risk is that this sell-off breaks other things on Wall Street. There's a small, but still growing contagion related to the bankruptcy of private auto parts supplier First Brands. It's roiling banks with exposure like Jefferies Financial Group and raising concerns about the once-booming private credit industry. Jefferies was down 4% on Friday and another 6% in after-hours trading.That's an area to watch, along with the possibility that large hedge funds buying on margin were caught too-long on Friday and now have to aggressively deleverage, which could add to selling pressures next week. The crypto markets, especially the smaller coins outside of bitcoin, were hit especially hard on Friday. The TRUMP meme coin is down 20% in the last 24 hours.Stock market futures open for trading Sunday evening at 6 p.m. ET. The bond market is closed Monday for Columbus Day.",

CNBC's Julia Boorstin got access to Sora 2 and tried prompts like \"show me a video of a fat orange cartoon cat eating lasagna\" and \"create a superhero that wears a black cape and is saving a woman from a burning building.\" Some of the prompts failed due to copyright infringement, while others worked.

    "body": "China's and U.S.' flags are seen printed on paper in this illustration taken January 27, 2022. Dado Ruvic | ReutersChina on Sunday said \"we are not afraid of\" a trade war with the United States after President Donald Trump vowed to impose punishing new retaliatory tariffs on Chinese imports.A spokesperson for China's Ministry of Commerce accused the U.S. of a \"textbook double standard\" with Trump's promise on Friday to tack on additional 100% tariffs on those imports after China imposed new export controls on rare earths minerals.That promise in a social media post by the president shook U.S. stock markets on Friday, erasing $2 trillion in equity values in a single day.Willful threats of high tariffs are not the right way to get along with China,\" the ministry spokesperson said.\"China's position on the trade war is consistent: we do not want it, but we are not afraid of it,\" they added.The spokesperson said that the United States \"for a long time … has been overstretching the concept of national security, abusing export control, taking discriminatory actions against China, and imposing unilateral long-arm jurisdiction measures on various products, including semiconductor equipment and chips.\"The U.S. Commerce Control list covers more than 3,000 items, more than three times the approximately 900 items on China's Export Control List of Dual-use Items, the spokesperson said.China called its export controls on rare earth exports a \"legitimate\" measure under international law, pushing back against U.S. accusations of economic coercion.The Commerce Ministry said the controls, issued Thursday, were part of Beijing's effort to strengthen its export control system and \"better safeguard world peace and regional stability\" amid what it described as a turbulent global security environment.Read more CNBC politics coverageTrump puts extra 100% tariff on China imports, adds export controls on 'critical software'Qatar Air Force facility to be built at USAF base in Idaho, Defense Secretary Hegseth saysTrump nominee Paul Ingrassia reportedly accused of sexual harassmentTrump administration begins layoffs of federal workers amid government shutdownNew York AG James indicted by grand jury after Trump called for chargesTrump threatens 'massive' tariff hike on China over rare earths disputeNobel Peace Prize winner Machado praises Trump after White House criticizes snub'There will start to be layoffs' if Trump decides shutdown talks have stalled, Hassett saysEpstein bank records sought by top House Democrat from Jamie Dimon, other CEOsTreasury weighs minting $1 coin with Trump's face for U.S. 250th anniversaryGovernment shutdown: Senate funding measures fail again as deadlock continuesThe measures, which now cover not only rare earth materials but also related intellectual property and technologies, were announced just weeks before a potential meeting between Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping.\"These controls do not constitute export bans. Applications that meet the requirements will be approved,\" the Commerce Ministry spokesperson said.\"China has fully assessed the potential impact of these measures on the supply chain and is confident that the impact will be very limited.\"Beijing's new curbs also require foreign entities to obtain a license to export products containing more than 0.1% of domestically-sourced rare earths, or manufactured using China's extraction, refining, magnet-making or recycling technology. Applications for items that could be used in weapons or other military purposes will be denied.U.S. Trade Representative Jamison Greer said Sunday that the U.S. was not notified of the new export controls in advance, \"and quickly, as soon as we found out from public sources, we reached out to the Chinese to have a phone call, and they deferred.\"Greer, speaking on Fox News' \"Sunday Briefing,\" called China's move \"a power grab.\"Shortly after Beijing tightened export controls on rare earths, the European Chamber of Commerce in China reported a backlog of export license applications awaiting approval, saying the new restrictions \"add further complexity to the global supply chains of rare earth elements.\"\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tWeekly analysis and insights from Asia's largest economy in your inbox\n\t\t\tSubscribe now\n\t\t\n\tIn response to Beijing's move, Trump on Friday announced new tariffs of 100% on imports from China \"over and above any Tariff that they are currently paying\" beginning Nov. 1.Trump also said that the U.S., on that same date, would also impose export controls on \"any and all critical software.\"Stock markets plunged after Trump said on Truth Social that \"there is no way that China should be allowed to hold the World 'captive'\" with its rare earths policy.China accounts for about 70% of the global supply of rare earths and has repeatedly used the critically needed minerals as a bargaining chip in trade discussions.Tensions whipsawHours after tightening export controls on rare earths, Beijing also announced that it would start charging U.S. ships docking at Chinese ports from Oct. 14, mirroring a new U.S. fee on Chinese vessels arriving at U.S. ports, set to take effect the same day.The U.S. accounts for only 0.1% of global shipbuilding, compared to 53.3% for China, according to the Center for Strategic and International Studies.China's Commerce Ministry defended its reciprocal decision as \"necessary passive defensive actions.\" It added that the U.S. actions \"seriously undermined the atmosphere of the economic and trade talks between the two sides.\"Senior U.S. and Chinese officials met for trade negotiations in Geneva in May — the first since Trump launched a global trade war. A follow-up meeting in London in June led to a trade \"framework,\" while a third round of high-level talks took place a month later in Stockholm, where both sides signaled progress in negotiations.The most recent trade meetings in Madrid in September yielded a \"basic framework consensus\" on the divestment of Chinese-owned TikTok, ahead of a deadline to either sell off its U.S. business or shut down the social media app in the country.On Sept. 19, Trump and Xi spoke on the phone but did not finalize a deal on TikTok. After the call, Trump announced that he and Xi agreed to meet on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum during the last week of October in Gyeongju, South Korea.While China has been silent on future meetings, Trump had also said he would visit China early next year and that Xi would come to the U.S. at a later date.However, Trump on Friday threatened in a social media post to cancel his upcoming meeting with Xi after China's latest tightening of export curbs on rare earths.— CNBC's Dan Mangan, Anniek Bao and Evelyn Cheng contributed to this story.",

    "body": "Brooke Cooper was 12 years old when she thought her career in baseball was over.She had aged out of her local Little League offerings and there were no more opportunities for girls to play the sport, Cooper tells CNBC Make It. She tried playing softball next, which is traditionally seen as the female counterpart to baseball, but says she \"didn't have the same passion.\"\"I loved playing baseball,\" Cooper, now 33, says. \"I never pictured I could have a career in baseball.\"In March 2024, Cooper became the general manager of the Worcester Red Sox, a Triple-A minor league affiliate of the Boston Red Sox, in Worcester, Massachusetts. She is the first female general manager in Boston Red Sox franchise history.However, Cooper says she was rejected the first time she applied for an internship with the team, then known as the Pawtucket Red Sox. That summer, the then 20-year-old waited tables and volunteered at a sports marketing firm instead, she says.From intern to general managerTwo years later, she says she applied for the merchandising internship again, this time as an MBA student at Providence College, and got the job.\"The first time, I tried to play it cool, which sounds so ridiculous because I was 20 years old and had no idea what I was doing,\" she says. \"That second time, I made it so clear how much I wanted it, how hard I would work, and I'm sure I probably had a better sense of maturity a couple of years later.\"As an intern, Cooper says she balanced business school classes with vacuuming and managing merchandise inventory in the team store.\"I was running my own small business within the larger business,\" and while the gig only paid her minimum wage, she says the experience itself was \"professionally fulfilling.\"Worcester Red SoxSoon, she began climbing the ranks, first as an assistant to the director of merchandising, and then a manager of merchandising. As the team's director of marketing and merchandising, she helped temporarily rebrand the Pawtucket Red Sox to the Hot Wieners in 2018. In 2021 she was promoted to the vice president of marketing, and the year after she became the team's assistant general manager.Dealing with imposter syndromeWhen Cooper started with the Worcester Red Sox in 2015, she says she didn't think it was possible to have a career in professional baseball. There was only one other woman working for the team's front office, and Cooper says her dream was to open a community center similar to a YMCA or Boys and Girls Club anyways.\"I say I don't have imposter syndrome, and then when I describe it, it's the definition of imposter syndrome,\" Cooper says.Looking back, she says having that imposter syndrome ended up working to her benefit because it allowed her to speak up and share her candid thoughts with managers and in meetings without being afraid of losing the job.  'I'm really, really happy to be part of an organization where this can be normalized'Cooper never felt singled out for being a woman either, she says. Her managers and team leadership have treated every promotion as a matter of fact, recognizing her as the best person for the job, she says. Becoming the Red Sox franchise's first female general manager wasn't \"a big deal\" in her organization until it was publicly announced, Cooper says.Of the 120 Minor League Baseball teams that serve as developmental programs for 30 Major League Baseball teams, 14 were led by female general managers in the 2025 season, according to the league. In 2020, Kim Ng was became the first and only female general manager to lead a Major League Baseball team. Ng left her role with the Miami Marlins in 2023.\"I'm really, really happy to be part of an organization where this can be normalized,\" Cooper says of the Worcester Red Sox. \"I find working in Minor League Baseball professionally challenging in a good way, and also very personally fulfilling … I am kind of living out my dream.\"Want to be your own boss? Sign up for CNBC's new online course, How To Start A Business: For First-Time Founders.

    "body": "Jensen Huang, CEO of Nvidia, speaking with CNBC's Jim Cramer during a CNBC Investing Club with Jim Cramer event at the New York Stock Exchange on Oct. 7th, 2025.Kevin Stankiewicz | CNBCShares of Amazon, Nvidia and Tesla each dropped around 5% on Friday, as tech's megacaps lost $770 billion in market cap, following President Donald Trump's threats for increased tariffs on Chinese goods.With tech's trillion-dollar companies occupying an increasingly large slice of the U.S. market, their declines sent the Nasdaq down 3.6% and the S&P 500 down 2.7%. For both indexes, it was the worst day since April, when Trump said he would slap \"reciprocal\" duties on U.S. trading partners.After market close on Friday, Trump declared in a social media post that the U.S. would impose a 100% tariff on China and, on Nov. 1, it would apply export controls \"on any and all critical software.\"Amazon, Nvidia and Tesla all slipped about 2% in extended trading following the post.The president's latest threats are disrupting, at least briefly, what had been a sustained rally in tech, built on hundreds of billions of dollars in planned spending on artificial intelligence infrastructure.Read more CNBC tech newsSingapore police probe Nvidia customer Megaspeed over alleged China export violationsTesla faces U.S. auto safety probe after reports FSD ran red lights, caused collisionsTop Hollywood agencies slam OpenAI's Sora as 'exploitation' and a risk to clientsGoogle launches Gemini subscriptions to help corporate workers build AI agentsIn late September, Nvidia, which makes graphics processing units for training AI models, became the first company to reach a market cap of $4.5 trillion. Nvidia alone saw its market capitalization decline by nearly $229 billion on Friday.OpenAI counts on Nvidia's GPUs from a series of cloud suppliers, including Microsoft. OpenAI is only seeing rising demand.In September it introduced the Sora 2 video creation app, and this week the company said the ChatGPT assistant now boasts over 800 million weekly users. Microsoft, which spends heavily on infrastructure to operate its cloud data centers, saw its market cap drop by $85 billion on Friday.The sell-off wiped out Amazon's gains for the year. That stock is now down 2% so far in 2025. Amazon competes with Microsoft to rent out GPUs from its cloud data centers. The online retailer lost $121 billion in value during the day.\"There continues to be a lot of noise about the impact that tariffs will have on retail prices and consumption,\" Amazon CEO Andy Jassy told analysts in July. \"Much of it thus far has been wrong and misreported. As we said before, it's impossible to know what will happen.\"Tesla, which introduced lower-priced vehicles on Tuesday, saw its market capitalization sink by $71 billion.The automaker reports third-quarter results on Oct. 22, with Microsoft earnings scheduled for the following week. Nvidia reports in November.Google parent Alphabet and Facebook owner Meta fell 2% and almost 4%, respectively.WATCH: Pres.

    "body": "Julia Roberts may an Academy Award-winning actress, but early in her career, she struggled to overcome harsh criticism.\"I don't think I entered into my career with much confidence,\" Roberts told People Magazine in a recent interview.Roberts, who broke through as an actress with films like \"Steel Magnolias\" and \"Pretty Woman,\" said that in her early 20s she encountered \"a few critical people who were really cruel.\"\"Being insecure, it can be crippling. So if someone embarrassed me, it stopped me,\" she recalls. \"I was apoplectic, so learning to navigate that — because this is not an industry to be in if you can't take criticism or harshness or being embarrassed.\"Instead of being discouraged, Roberts chose to view those situations as an \"interesting challenge for me to decide the kind of person I wanted to strive to be,\" she told People.She describes her experience as a young actress as \"more bumps than smooth sailing,\" but today, she sees her past hurdles as opportunities for growth.\"I would think, 'Okay, there's a reason why it has to be so hard.' Now I look at it as some of the lessons that I'm the most grateful for because they proved my endurance to myself,\" she said.\"I had a lot of things I needed to overcome for myself,\" Roberts continued.Coping with criticism in the workplaceBuilding resilience is \"particularly important for young woman who are starting their careers,\" regardless of industry, according to career and leadership coach Phoebe Gavin.\"We receive a lot of cultural conditioning that makes us very critical of ourselves and very concerned about being observed and being judged,\" Gavin says. \"All of those things can bring up a lot of insecurity as we enter the workplace.\"No matter how self-assured you are, harsh criticism can feel crushing, she says.If abrasive feedback is taking a toll on your confidence, the most crucial thing to remember is \"to put distance between yourself and the criticism,\" Gavin says.\"When you hear people say critical things or mean things or cruel things, remember that it's about them, that that is a reflection of who they are. It's not necessarily a reflection of who you are,\" she says.Instead of internalizing others' unkind words, \"think very loudly in your own mind about the things that make you valuable and what you're bringing to the table,\" Gavin says.There may be a \"kernel of truth\" inside some criticism, according to Gavin: \"Sometimes useful feedback can come in very ugly packaging,\" she says.If that's the case, Gavin recommends taking some time to reflect on your actions and what you could change in the future.\"Instead of internalizing it as something that is permanently true about you forever, find the places where you have agency to make positive change in yourself or the way that you work,\" she says.Still, if your workplace is taking a toll on your mental health, \"it's OK for you to decide for yourself that being in that sort of environment isn't right for you,\" Gavin says.Want to earn more and grow your money? Save 30% with this earnings-boosting bundle of our top courses.Plus, sign up for CNBC Make It's newsletter to get tips and tricks for success at work, with money and in life, and request to join our exclusive community on LinkedIn to connect with experts and peers.",

    "body": "The Snowflake Inc logo, the American cloud computing-based data company that offers cloud-based storage and analytics services, is on their pavilion during the Mobile World Congress 2025 in Barcelona, Spain, on March 5, 2025.Joan Cros | Nurphoto | Getty ImagesInvestors are looking beyond the prolonged U.S. government shutdown and remain optimistic about growth drivers like the artificial intelligence boom and expectations of further interest rate cuts.Ignoring the short-term noise, those looking for attractive investment opportunities can consider the stock picks of top Wall Street analysts, whose recommendations are based on a thorough analysis of a company's fundamentals and growth catalysts.Here are three stocks favored by the Street's top pros, according to TipRanks, a platform that ranks analysts based on their past performance.SnowflakeFirst on this week's list is Snowflake (SNOW), a cloud-native data platform. At the recently held Snowflake World Tour event in New York City, the company highlighted its product innovation and the vision for driving business transformation through data and artificial intelligence.After attending this customer conference, Jefferies analyst Brent Thill reiterated a buy rating on SNOW stock with a price forecast of $270. Based on his conversations with customers and partners at the event, the analyst noted that Snowflake's product innovation and velocity are accelerating.Thill highlighted that while traction for Snowflake's AI offerings is building, the inflection point is still ahead. For instance, the top-rated analyst noted that a retailer using Snowpark ML for demand forecasting, and a travel company integrating Snowflake ML models into its customer experience pipeline, both believe that broader usage across their organizations will take a few more quarters.Another key takeaway was that Snowflake's unstructured data capabilities have strengthened, but there are still some gaps to address. Overall, Thill believes that while traction is building for Snowflake, the \"AI Blizzard\" still lies ahead.\"SNOW remains one of our favorite data & AI stories and stands to benefit meaningfully as enterprise AI strategies mature and AI driven data volumes grow exponentially in the coming years,\" concluded Thill. Interestingly, TipRanks' AI Analyst has a \"neutral\" rating on Snowflake stock with a price target of $255.Thill ranks No. 251 among more than 10,000 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been successful 65% of the time, delivering an average return of 14.1%. See Snowflake Ownership Structure on TipRanks.Advanced Micro DevicesMoving on to chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), which recently made headlines after announcing a game-changing partnership with OpenAI. Under this deal, OpenAI will deploy up to 6 gigawatts of AMD Instinct GPUs over multiple years, starting with a 1-gigawatt rollout in the second half of 2026. The agreement also involves a warrant for up to 160 million shares (vesting tied to certain milestones), which, if fully exercised by OpenAI, will give it about a 10% stake in AMD.Following the news, Jefferies analyst Blayne Curtis upgraded AMD stock to buy from hold and boosted the price target to $300 from $170. Additionally, TipRanks' AI Analyst has an \"outperform\" rating on AMD stock with a price target of $232.Curtis believes that AMD's deal with OpenAI clearly changed the AI narrative for the semiconductor company. While the chipmaker will still have to achieve some milestones, the 5-star analyst believes that this partnership is a solid confirmation of AMD's AI roadmap and a proof of robust AI demand in general.Interestingly, Curtis recently raised his estimates for AMD following positive server checks. The analyst stated he was incrementally positive on AMD after his recent Asia trip, with the expectation of 500 basis points per year share gains in server CPUs with the company's Venice platform.However, these recent checks hadn't helped Curtis grasp anything from the original device manufacturers (ODMs) in terms of AI ramps. \"The announcement of OpenAI as a lead customer with the potential for $80-100B in revenue across 6GW of compute through 2030 materially changes that outlook,\" said Curtis.Curtis ranks No. 68 among more than 10,000 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been profitable 65% of the time, delivering an average return of 27.5%. See AMD ETF Exposure on TipRanks.Dell TechnologiesIT infrastructure and personal computing solutions provider Dell Technologies (DELL) announced an increase in its long-term financial targets during its analyst meeting on Oct. 7. The improved outlook is backed by demand from the ongoing AI wave.Following the event, Mizuho analyst Vijay Rakesh reiterated a buy rating on DELL stock and raised his price target to $170 from $160. Meanwhile, TipRanks' AI Analyst has a \"neutral\" rating on DELL stock with a price target of $135.Rakesh noted management's commentary about momentum in enterprise and sovereign AI, with strong demand signals over 12-18 months. The top-rated analyst highlighted that the company raised its compound annual growth rate target for revenue for fiscal 2026 to 2030 to the range of 7% to 9%, with non-GAAP EPS expected to rise by 15% or more.Furthermore, Rakesh noted that Dell's fiscal 2026 AI server revenue estimate of $20 billion is in line with the Street's consensus of $20.6 billion and reflects over 100% growth from $9.8 billion in the previous year. The company expects a 20% to 25% CAGR through Fiscal 2030, implying AI server revenue of $46 billion.However, the analyst believes that this growth outlook could be conservative, as the company is involved in all at-scale AI cluster deployments and leads in T2 CSP (tier 2 cloud service providers) and enterprise AI deployments with more than 3,000 customers.Rakesh ranks No. 81 among more than 10,000 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been successful 65% of the time, delivering an average return of 24.3%. See Dell Technologies Hedge Fund Activity on TipRanks.",

    "body": "Robert E. Yarber is on top of the world — literally. The 41-year-old American currently resides in Tromso, Norway, a town you'll find at just about the tippy top of your map. It's about 220 miles north of the Arctic Circle.And given his troubled past — and the peace he's found in his new home — it's an apt description of his emotional state as well.\"I sat in a prison cell, a six-by-nine cell, with another grown man for five years of my life,\" Yarber says. \"I wanted to see Paris, London, Berlin, and swim in the Mediterranean, check out the Dead Sea. I wanted to see all that stuff with my eyes. I didn't want to watch it on TV.\"Shortly after he got out of prison for good in 2014, Yarber embarked on a European adventure, one that's seen him travel to 44 countries and establish a new home for himself abroad. \"I just bet it all on myself and went for it all,\" he says.Robert E. Yarber, 41, works as a bartender and bar manager in Tromso, Norway.Ismaele Tortella for CNBC Make ItSo far, so good.Yarber currently works as a bartender and bar manager and makes about $26 an hour for an annual income of about $46,000. It's not a fortune, but it's more than enough to live a comfortable life among people he says have truly embraced him.\"It's so much love, and I feel so welcome. I mean, Norway is my home,\" he says. \"When I'm in the States, I feel like a fish out of water, almost. And now here in Norway, I've been able to move and groove a little bit.\"Bad decisions and imprisonmentIn his youth, Yarber did much of his moving and grooving on the football field — he set a league record for interceptions during is junior year of high school in Corvalis, Oregon.\"And I just figured I would just go to university, and I just kept going to the next level,\" he says.However, a pair of knee injuries ended Yarber's football career, and he dropped out of college after his freshman year. He took a job as a dishwasher at Denny's, his first of many in the food and beverage service industry.In 2006, when Yarber was 21, things went off the rails. While attending a party, Yarber and a friend got in a physical altercation with other guests, which Yarber says escalated into a melee. When Yarber managed to escape back to his car, he found himself faced with a difficult decision.\"I'm sitting there and I'm like, 'Man, I could get in the car and drive away. I'm free,'\" he says. \"This is my best friend at the time. It's my roommate, and he's still in there all by himself, and nobody to help him.\"Yarber was determined to see the world after spending five years in prison as a young man.Ismaele Tortella for CNBC Make ItYarber pulled two baseball bats from his trunk and went back in. He'd be the first to tell you it was the wrong choice.He spent a four-year sentence in Oregon State Penitentiary as a result of the incident. And when he got out, finding his footing was tougher than he thought.\"When I got out and I was trying to get a job, I couldn't get a job,\" Yarber says. \"I tried for all the jobs I wanted to get. Couldn't get those. Tried for all the jobs I didn't want. Couldn't get those. Tried for all the jobs I felt were like beneath me that I would never have done before. Couldn't get those either.\"To support himself, Yarber took a former cellmate up on an offer to sell cocaine. He was caught and did another 14 months in prison. He was released in March of 2014. He's stayed out of legal trouble since.Heading north and 'just trying to figure it out'Yarber struggled initially upon his release. He managed to find gigs as a server and bartender, but had difficulty keeping his life and relationships on firm footing as he wrestled with addiction.When he and a serious girlfriend lost a pregnancy, Yarber says he fell into a depression and knew he needed a change of scenery. In December of 2018 he found a job in the Aleutian Islands off the coast of Alaska.\"I figured, if I go there, there's really not much trouble you can get into. You're on an island can't get off,\" Yarber says. \"I was going to just go there, work in a fish factory and the processing plant and just try to get some sobriety under my belt and just try to figure it out.\"He soon realized Alaska wasn't quite far enough. He had previously planned a trip to Norway with his ex, a woman of Norwegian heritage. The trip was canceled when the pair broke up. But when he decided to take a shot at living overseas, he figured he'd already done all the research and didn't mind the cold. He packed his bags for Scandanavia in May 2019.Yarber was granted a skilled worker visa in 2022 after attending European Bartender School.Ismaele Tortella for CNBC Make ItMoving abroad, though, wasn't quite as easy as Yarber would have thought.\"I honestly thought that I could just walk into another country, walk into a bar, and just be like, 'Hey, can I get a job?'\" he says. When asked if he had a visa, he told a prospective employer that, yes, he had a credit card.He applied for a visa four times, running into problems over his pay, his bona fides as a skilled laborer and proving his vaccination status during the Covid-19 pandemic. Eventually, after he attended European Bartender School and got the rest of his documents in order, Yarber was granted a skilled worker visa in 2022, which he renews annually for about $640.Life in Norway: 'The country really cares about its people'For the most part, life above the Arctic Circle is pretty quiet.Yarber tends and manages the bar at the Havblikk Hotel in Tromsdalen — the town just across the bridge from Tromso. It's an upscale joint frequented by locals.He earns around 260 kroner, or about $26 an hour, and tends to work about 35 hours a week. Income in Norway is taxed at a flat 22% rate plus a graduated \"bracket tax\" a further contribution to the country's national insurance. Yarber says he's taxed a rate of about 32% to 34%, but he still feels like he has plenty of money to live a comfortable life. He lives alone in a 35-square meter apartment, complete with what he says is a universal Norwegian luxury: heated bathroom floors.On a typical day, you might find him working out at the gym or sharing a chai latte with friends — mostly other service industry workers. Otherwise, he might catch a movie or spend time playing video games or creating content for his YouTube or TikTok channels.Plus, Yarber feels like his taxes are being put to good use. Workers enjoy substantial protections in Norway, he says. Those who work odd hours are paid at a premium, and employees' hours cannot be cut or rescheduled without their permission he says — which is unheard of in the American service industry.Yarber is studying for a Norwegian language and social studies test in the hopes of becoming a permanent resident.Ismaele Tortella for CNBC Make ItAnd if he gets sick or injured, he's covered.\"That tax money goes to work by paying for surgeries when you need it, paying for medication, paying for rides to the hospital and back,\" Yarber says. \"Sick leave, leave if you have children or parental leave — it just shows that it's a country that really cares about its people and isn't trying to use everything to make money.\"Looking aheadIn short, Yarber feels like he's found a home. He's practicing for his Norwegian language test — part of the process of becoming a permanent resident. He rates his current proficiency at about a five out of 10. He can carry a conversation and order at a restaurant, he says.\"Could I get up and do a TED talk in Norwegian? No.\"All in due time. Yarber hopes to eventually stash some of his money away in order to buy a car (he currently relies on public transportation) and a house in his new hometown. Until now, he hasn't saved much, opting instead to use any extra funds to travel.\"I should be having savings but, and maybe it's this trauma from being in prison for so long and just wanting to see the world, I've now traveled to 44 countries,\" he says. \"I spend my money on traveling. If I got extra money, I'm traveling. I just want to see the world.\"It's a sentiment that puts him right at home in the land of Norse explorers. \"I'm a Black Viking in heart,\" he says.Conversions from NOK to USD were done using the OANDA conversion rate of 1 USD to 9.85 NOK on Sept. 19, 2025.
